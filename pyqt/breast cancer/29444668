This biologically active compound has been shown to have promisingtherapeutic potential against cancer cells, but its mechanism of action remainsunclear.METHODS: The inhibitory effect of gigantol on Wnt/β-catenin signaling wasevaluated with the SuperTOPFlash reporter system. The levels of phosphorylatedlow-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 (LRP6), total LRP6 andcytosolic β-catenin were determined by Western blot analysis. The expression ofWnt target genes was analyzed using real-time PCR. Cell viability was measuredwith a MTT assay. The effect of gigantol on cell migration was examined usingscratch wound-healing and transwell migration assays.RESULTS: Gigantol decreased the level of phosphorylated LRP6 and cytosolicβ-catenin in HEK293 cells. In breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells,treatment with gigantol reduced the level of phosphorylated LRP6, total LRP6 and cytosolic β-catenin in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a decrease in theexpression of Wnt target genes Axin2 and Survivin. We further demonstrated thatgigantol suppressed the viability and migratory capacity of breast cancer cells.CONCLUSION: Gigantol is a novel inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Itinhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling through downregulation of phosphorylated LRP6and cytosolic β-catenin in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1186/s12906-018-2108-x PMCID: PMC5813406PMID: 29444668  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
