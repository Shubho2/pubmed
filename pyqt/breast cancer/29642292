Natural killer (NK)cells are large lymphocytes that directly kill cancer cells. However, manyaggressive cancers, including breast cancer, were reported to escape thesuccessful killing of NK cells in a tumor microenvironment. In this study, weinvestigated the anti-cancer effect of curcumin in coculture of human breastcarcinoma MDA-MB-231 and NK (NK-92) cells. We found that curcumin had animmune-stimulatory effect on NK-92 by increasing the surface expression of theCD16‚Å∫ and CD56dim population of NK-92. We confirmed that the cytotoxic effect of NK-92 on MDA-MB-231 was significantly enhanced in the presence of curcumin, whichwas highly associated with the activation of Stat4 and Stat5 proteins in NK-92.Finally, this improved anticancer effect of curcumin was correlated withdecreased expression of pErk and PI3K in MDA-MB-231.DOI: 10.4014/jmb.1801.01074 PMID: 29642292
