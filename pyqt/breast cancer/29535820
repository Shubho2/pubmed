Long non-coding RNAs respond to several extrinsic stimuli, causingchanges in cancer cells by participating in multiple steps of gene expression.However, genomic profiling of long non-coding RNAs regulated by oxygen in breast cancer remained unclear. Therefore, the aims of this study were to identifyoxygen-responsive long non-coding RNAs in breast cancer cells, and to delineatetheir regulatory mechanisms. The expression profiling of long non-coding RNAs in breast cancer cells growing under normoxic, hypoxic, and re-oxygenated conditionswas examined using next-generation sequencing technology. Four hundred andseventy-two lncRNAs oxygen-responsive lncRNAs were identified. After examiningthe top three differentially expressed lncRNAs in hypoxia, we selected N-MycDownstream Regulated Gene 1-Overlapping 1 (NDRG1-OT1) for further study,especially the most responsive isoform, NDRG1-OT1_v4. We overexpressedNDRG1-OT1_v4 under normoxia and performed microarray analysis to identify 108NDRG1-OT1_v4 regulated genes and their functions. Among these genes, we foundthat both NDRG1 mRNA expression and NDRG1 protein levels were inhibited byNDRG1-OT1_v4. Finally, we used co-immunoprecipitation to show that NDRG1-OT1_v4destabilizes NDRG1 by promoting ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Our findingsreveal a new type of epigenetic regulation of NDRG1 by NDRG1-OT1_v4 in breastcancer cells.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23732 PMCID: PMC5828211PMID: 29535820
