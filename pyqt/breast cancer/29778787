ThePALOMA-3 trial, showing benefit of palbociclib plus fulvestrant compared tofulvestrant alone in HR+HER2- MBC after progression while receiving endocrinetherapy excluded women previously treated with everolimus. The objective of this study was to examine outcomes of HR+HER2- MBC with prior exposure to everolimuswhile receiving palbociclib-based therapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, single-institute review was conducted ofHR+HER2- MBC from January 2014 to November 2016 in patients treated withpalbociclib after prior treatment with everolimus. Progression-free survival(PFS) was defined as the time from initiation of palbociclib to the date ofprogression as determined by the treating physician based on radiologic,biochemical, and/or clinical criteria. Response rates were determined on thebasis of available radiologic data. Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the rate of any complete or partial responses; clinical benefit rate (CBR) wasthe rate of complete response, partial response, or stable disease for at least24 weeks.RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with a mean (range) age of 68 (42-81) years wereidentified. Kaplan-Meier estimate showed median PFS of 2.9 months (95% confidenceinterval, 2.1-4.2); ORR was 0 of 23 and CBR was 4 (17.4%) of 23. In the PALOMA-3 trial, median PFS, ORR, and CBR of palbociclib cohort were 9.5 months (95%confidence interval, 9.2-11.0), 19%, and 67%, respectively.CONCLUSION: There is a limited clinical activity of palbociclib combinationsafter progression with everolimus combination therapy. Further studies arenecessary to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.04.015 PMID: 29778787
