A total of 74 patients who received NAC followed by surgery were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwentbreast MRI before NAC. Perfusion parameters including Ktrans, Kep and Ve of tumorwere measured three-dimensionally. These perfusion parameters of backgroundparenchyma of contralateral breasts were analyzed two-dimensionally.Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and multivariable logisticregression analysis were performed to compare the ability of perfusion parametersto predict pCR. Of 74 patients, 13 achieved pCR in final pathology. The fiftieth percentile and skewness of each perfusion parameter - Ktrans, Kep, and Ve oftumor were associated with pCR. Perfusion parameters of contralateral breastparenchyma in 2D analysis also showed predictive ability for pCR. The modelcombining perfusion parameters of contralateral breast background parenchyma and those of the tumor had higher predictive value than each single parameter. Thus, perfusion parameters of tumor, background parenchyma of contralateral breast and their combinations in pretreatment breast MRI allow early prediction for pCR ofbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27764-9 PMCID: PMC6014994PMID: 29934524
