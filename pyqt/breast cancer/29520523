Second primary malignancy (SPM) isa problem for long-term survivors after achieving complete response (CR) by dCRT.METHODS: The source of the subjects in this study was the patients with stageII/III (excluding T4 disease) ESCC (UICC6th) who underwent dCRT from 2000 to 2011at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan. SPM, defined as malignancy newlydetected at different site from the initial disease, was checked in patients who achieved CR by the initial dCRT.RESULTS: Among the 285 patients with stage II/III (excluding T4 disease) ESCC whounderwent dCRT, 185 patients achieved CR. SPM was detected in 49 patients (mediantime to developing SPM, 41.5 months), accounting for 19.3% (95% CI 0.137-0.257)as the 5-year cumulative risk of SPM. SPMs were head and neck cancer (n = 12),gastric cancer (n = 12), esophageal cancer (n = 7), lung cancer (n = 5), coloncancer (n = 4), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 3), bladder cancer (n = 2),small intestinal cancer (n = 1), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1), malignant melanoma(n = 1), and breast cancer (n = 1). There were no significant differences inbaseline characteristics between the patients who developed SPM (n = 49) andothers (n = 136).CONCLUSIONS: Because second primary malignancy developed often after achieving CRby dCRT for ESCC, it should be followed carefully.DOI: 10.1007/s10147-018-1258-7 PMID: 29520523
