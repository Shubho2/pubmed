A previous study using breast cancer cellsdemonstrated the negative feedback modulation of the epidermal growth factorreceptor (EGFR) and receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (ErbB2) viaextracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated phosphorylation of conservedThr-669 and Thr-677 residues, respectively, in the juxtamembrane domain. Inaddition, CDDP has been identified to cause negative feedback inhibition ofactivated EGFR in lung cancer cells. In the present study, the role ofphosphorylation in the feedback control of the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer in humanbreast and gastric cancer cells was investigated. Phosphorylation of ErbB2 atThr-677 was induced by CDDP and DOX, which in turn reduced tyrosineautophosphorylation of ErbB2 and ErbB3. Treatment with trametinib, amitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor that blocks ERK-mediated Thr-677phosphorylation, and substitution of Thr-677 to alanine, blocked the feedbackinhibition of ErbB2 and ErbB3. In addition, these agents caused the degradationof ErbB proteins through the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase(p38) and ERK. These results demonstrate that chemotherapeutic agents triggerERK- and p38-mediated post-translational downregulation of ErbB receptors.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7532 PMCID: PMC5776949PMID: 29434871
