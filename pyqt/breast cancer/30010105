Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMMP-9) and its inhibitor TIMP-1participate in tumor invasion and metastasis. This study analyzed the effect ofvarious treatment approaches on TIMP-1 and MMP-9 levels in terminal stage breast cancer. Post-op breast cancer patients including chemo-radio therapy group,radio-chemo therapy group and simultaneously chemo- and radio-therapy group were compared for efficacy, along with assays for TIMP-1 and MMP-9 levels foranalyzing their correlation with clinical-pathological features of breast cancer.Chemo + radio-therapy group had lower focal recurrence and distal metastasis thanthe other two groups, plus higher 5-year survival rates (p<0.05). Aftertreatment, all patients showed lower serum MMP-9 level, activity and higherTIMP-1 levels than those before treatment (p< 0.05). Concurrent radio +chemo-therapy group showed lower serum MMP-9 level, activity and higher TIMP-1levels (p< 0.05 compared to the other two groups). Serum MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels after treatment are correlated with patient age, pathological grade, tumor sizeand lymph node metastasis (p< 0.05). Simultaneous chemo- and radio-therapy onbreast cancer patients after surgery could reduce focal recurrent rate or distal metastasis rate, thus improving 5-year survival rate. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels arecorrelated with age, pathological grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis of breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-170901 PMID: 30010105
