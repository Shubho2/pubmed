[Epub ahead ofprint]Estimation of causal effect measures with the R-package stdReg.Sjölander A(1).Author information: (1)Karolinska Institute, Nobels väg 12 A, 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.arvid.sjolander@ki.se.Measures of causal effects play a central role in epidemiology. A wide range ofmeasures exist, which are designed to give relevant answers to substantiveepidemiological research questions. However, due to mathematical convenience and software limitations most studies only report odds ratios for binary outcomes andhazard ratios for time-to-event outcomes. In this paper we show how logisticregression models and Cox proportional hazards regression models can be used toestimate a wide range of causal effect measures, with the R-package stdReg. Forillustration we focus on the attributable fraction, the number needed to treatand the relative excess risk due to interaction. We use two publicly availabledata sets, so that the reader can easily replicate and elaborate on the analyses.The first dataset includes information on 487 births among 188 women, and thesecond dataset includes information on 2982 women diagnosed with primary breastcancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10654-018-0375-y PMID: 29536223
