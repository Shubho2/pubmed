A computer algorithm extracted acomprehensive set of 529 features from the DCE-MR images of these patients. Theset of patients was divided into a training set and a test set. Using thetraining set we developed two machine learning-based models to discriminate (1)high ODX scores from intermediate and low ODX scores, and (2) high andintermediate ODX scores from low ODX scores. The performance of these models was evaluated on the independent test set.RESULTS: High against low and intermediate ODX scores were predicted by themultivariate model with AUC 0.77 (95% CI 0.56-0.98, p < 0.003). Low againstintermediate and high ODX score was predicted with AUC 0.51 (95% CI 0.41-0.61,p = 0.75).CONCLUSION: A moderate association between imaging and ODX score was identified. The evaluated models currently do not warrant replacement of ODX with imagingalone.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2595-7 PMCID: PMC5920720 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29427210  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
