China.The ability of tumor cells to migrate is biologically fundamental fortumorigenesis, growth, metastasis and invasion. The present study examined therole of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (RAC1) andvasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) in breast cancer cell migration.According to data in Kaplan, Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas, increasedexpression levels of RAC1 and VASP in breast cancer are associated with decreasedcancer cell differentiation, advanced pathological stage and more aggressivetumor subtypes, while increased VASP mRNA expression levels are positivelycorrelated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. The shorthairpin (sh)RNA technique was employed to knock down the expression of RAC1 orVASP. Stable interference with the expression of RAC1 or VASP using RAC1-shRNA orVASP-shRNA, respectively, was established in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. InRAC1-shRNA or VASP-shRNA cells, the protein expression levels of RAC1 or VASPwere significantly downregulated compared with control cells. The proliferationand migration rates of the RAC1-shRNA or VASP-shRNA cells were significantlylower compared with control cells. It was observed that the protein expressionlevels of VASP also decreased in RAC1-shRNA cells compared with control cells.The results revealed that RAC1 and VASP may serve important roles in promotingthe migration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and that VASP may among thedownstream signaling molecules associated with RAC1.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8930 PMCID: PMC6036495PMID: 30008913
