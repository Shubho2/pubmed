Excluded from hormonal and targetedtherapies effectively used for other subtypes of breast cancer, standardchemotherapy is one of the primary treatment options for these patients. However,as ER- patients have shown highly heterogeneous responses to differentchemotherapies, it has been difficult to select most beneficial chemotherapytreatments for them. In this study, we have simultaneously developed single drug biomarker models for four standard chemotherapy agents: paclitaxel (T),5-fluorouracil (F), doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) to predict responsesand survival of ER- breast cancer patients treated with combinationchemotherapies. We then flexibly combined these individual drug biomarkers forpredicting patient outcomes of two independent cohorts of ER- breast cancerpatients who were treated with different drug combinations of neoadjuvantchemotherapy. These individual and combined drug biomarker models significantlypredicted chemotherapy response for 197 ER- patients in the Hatzis cohort(AUC = 0.637, P = 0.002) and 69 ER- patients in the Hess cohort (AUC = 0.635,P = 0.056). The prediction was also significant for the TN subgroup of bothcohorts (AUC = 0.60, 0.72, P = 0.043, 0.009). In survival analysis, our predictedresponder patients showed significantly improved survival with a >17 monthslonger median PFS than the predicted non-responder patients for both ER- and TNsubgroups (log-rank test P-value = 0.018 and 0.044). This flexible predictioncapability based on single drug biomarkers may allow us to even select new drugcombinations most beneficial to individual patients with ER- breast cancer.© 2018 The authors.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-17-0495 PMCID: PMC5920016PMID: 29599124
