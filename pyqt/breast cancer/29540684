Nonetheless, formidable challenges remain for theattainment of comparable success in patients with solid tumors. To accelerateprogress and rapidly characterize emerging toxicities, systems that permit therepeated and non-invasive assessment of CAR T-cell bio-distribution would beinvaluable. An ideal solution would entail the use of a non-immunogenic reporter that mediates specific uptake of an inexpensive, non-toxic and clinicallyestablished imaging tracer by CAR T cells. Here we show the utility of the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) for the temporal and spatial monitoring of CART-cell behavior in a cancer-bearing host. This system provides a clinicallycompliant toolkit for high-resolution serial imaging of CAR T cells in vivo,addressing a fundamental unmet need for future clinical development in the field.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03524-1 PMCID: PMC5852048PMID: 29540684  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
