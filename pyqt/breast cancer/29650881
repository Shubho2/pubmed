Gan To Kagaku Ryoho. 2018 Mar;45(Suppl 1):74-76.[Combination Therapy of Oxycodone and Tapentadol Was Effective for IntractablePain Caused by Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis - A Case Report].[Article in Japanese]Matsuura T(1), Kusakabe A, Kessoku T, Honda Y, Yoshimi A, Goto A, Yoshida H,Sukegawa A, Nakajima A, Ichikawa Y.Author information: (1)Palliative Care Medical Dept., Yokohama City University Hospital.A 52-year-old woman had been prescribed oral medication of acetaminophen,non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and oxycodone for intractablepain associated with thoracic metastasis of breast cancer. However, the paincontrol was poor. Although pregabalin and gabapentin were used as supplementaryanalgesics, they could not be continued because of their side effects. Based onthe noradrenalin reincorporation-inhibiting action of tapentadol, a combinationtherapy of tapentadol and oxycodone was introduced and satisfactory pain control was achieved. No side effects from the combined opioids were observed. Thisfinding indicates the potential of administrating a combination therapy ofm-opioid receptor agonists(such as morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl)withtapentadol, which has a noradrenaline reincorporation-inhibiting action, as aneffective remedy for alleviating intractable pain complicated with neuropathicpain.PMID: 29650881
