Overall anddisease-free survival were compared; prognostic factors were evaluated.Results: Triple-negative breast cancer corresponded to 19.5% of breast cancerdiagnosis and was more prevalent among nonwhite and less educated women. Thepatients with TNBC tended to present with stage III cancer, high p53 expression, lymphocytic infiltration, and multifocality and treated with radical surgery and chemotherapy. The 5-year overall and disease-free survival were 62.1% and 57.5%for TNBC and 80.8% and 75.3% for non-TNBC, respectively (P < .001). The TNBCrecurrence was associated with multicentricity, whereas lymph node involvementincreased the risk of both recurrence and death. Non-TNBC worse clinical coursewas associated with nonwhite ethnicity, lower education level, lymph nodeinvolvement, and advanced stage.Conclusions: Triple-negative breast cancer exhibited a more aggressive behavior, earlier and more frequent recurrence, and worse survival compared with non-TNBC. While biological and social variables were associated with poorer prognosis innon-TNBC, only lymph node involvement and multicentricity were correlated withworse clinical outcomes in TNBC.DOI: 10.1177/1179554918790563 PMCID: PMC6071162PMID: 30083066
