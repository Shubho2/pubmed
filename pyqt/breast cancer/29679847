Considering the importance of breast cancer worldwideand the promising results reported by deep learning based methods in breastimaging, an overview of the recent state-of-the-art deep learning based CADsystems developed for mammography and breast histopathology images is presented. In this study, the relationship between mammography and histopathology phenotypesis described, which takes biological aspects into account. We propose a computer based breast cancer modelling approach: theMammography-Histology-Phenotype-Linking-Model, which develops a mapping offeatures/phenotypes between mammographic abnormalities and theirhistopathological representation. Challenges are discussed along with thepotential contribution of such a system to clinical decision making and treatmentmanagement.Crown Copyright Â© 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.
