Therefore,prediction of the effects of missense mutations using in silico tools has become a frequently used approach. Aim of this study was to assess the reliability of insilico prediction as a basis for clinical decision making in the context ofhereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer.METHODS: We tested the performance of four prediction tools (Align-GVGD, SIFT,PolyPhen-2, MutationTaster2) using a set of 236 BRCA1/2 missense variants thathad previously been classified by expert committees. However, a major pitfall in the creation of a reliable evaluation set for our purpose is the generallyaccepted classification of BRCA1/2 missense variants using the multifactoriallikelihood model, which is partially based on Align-GVGD results. To overcomethis drawback we identified 161 variants whose classification is independent ofany previous in silico prediction. In addition to the performance as stand-alone tools we examined the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Matthews correlationcoefficient (MCC) of combined approaches.RESULTS: PolyPhen-2 achieved the lowest sensitivity (0.67), specificity (0.67),accuracy (0.67) and MCC (0.39). Align-GVGD achieved the highest values ofspecificity (0.92), accuracy (0.92) and MCC (0.73), but was outperformedregarding its sensitivity (0.90) by SIFT (1.00) and MutationTaster2 (1.00). Alltools suffered from poor specificities, resulting in an unacceptable proportionof false positive results in a clinical setting. This shortcoming could not bebypassed by combination of these tools. In the best case scenario, 138 familieswould be affected by the misclassification of neutral variants within the cohort of patients of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer.CONCLUSION: We show that due to low specificities state-of-the-art in silicoprediction tools are not suitable to predict pathogenicity of variants ofuncertain significance in BRCA1/2. Thus, clinical consequences should never bebased solely on in silico forecasts. However, our data suggests that SIFT andMutationTaster2 could be suitable to predict benignity, as both tools did notresult in false negative predictions in our analysis.DOI: 10.1186/s12920-018-0353-y PMCID: PMC5870501PMID: 29580235
