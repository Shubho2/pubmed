However, the therapeutic effects of thec-Src inhibitor on TNBC patients are controversial compared to those on celllines. The molecular mechanisms of the inhibitory effects of the c-Src inhibitor on TNBC remain unclear. Herein, we showed that a specific c-Src inhibitor, PP2,was effective in inhibiting phosphorylation of c-Src in 4 cell lines: T-47D,SK-BR-3, SUM1315MO2, and MDA-MB-231, regardless of hormone receptors and humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression levels. Giving PP2preferentially reduced the S phase of cell cycles and inhibited colony formation in SUM1315MO2 and MDA-MB-231, but not in SK-BR-3 and T-47D cells. Furthermore,PP2 effectively blocked cell migration/invasion and epithelial-mesenchymaltransition (EMT) in TNBC cell lines, SUM1315MO2 and MDA-MB-231. An EMT biomarker,vimentin, was highly expressed in 2 TNBC cell lines when they were compared with SK-BR-3 and T-47D cells. Further depletion of vimentin by shRNA remarkablyattenuated the inhibitory effects of the c-Src inhibitor on TNBC cells in vitroand in vivo, indicating a crucial action of vimentin to affect the function ofc-Src in TNBC. This study provides an important rationale for the clinic toprecisely select TNBC patients who would benefit from c-Src inhibitor treatment. This finding suggests that traditional markers for TNBC are not sufficient toprecisely define this aggressive type of cancer. Vimentin is identified as animportant biomarker to enable categorization of TNBC.© 2018 The Authors.
