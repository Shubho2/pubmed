[Epubahead of print]Pimpinelol, a novel atypical Sesquiterpene lactone from Pimpinella haussknechtii fruits with evaluation of endoplasmic reticulum stress in breast cancer cells.Aghaei M(1), Ghanadian M(2), Sajjadi SE(3), Saghafian R(3), KeyvanlooShahrestanaki M(1).Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan,Iran.(2)Department of Pharmacognosy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.; National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy,Mississippi University, Oxford, MS 38655, USA.. Electronic address:Ghannadian@gmail.com.(3)Department of Pharmacognosy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.Pimpinella haussknechtii is an annual native plant grows in west of Iran.Phytochemical study of the fruits of P. haussknechtii led to the isolation of anovel irregular sesquiterpene lactone with a new skeletone and oxidation pattern named: pimpinelol. The structure of the isolated compound was elucidated byextensive spectroscopic methods. Cytotoxic activity of Pimpinelol was evaluatedusing standard MTT assay against breast cancer cells. Induced endoplasmicreticulum stress and related gene expressions were evaluated with fluorescencemicroscopy analysis and real time PCR, respectively. These findings confirmedthat Pimpinelol concentrations dependently increased protein aggregation and the mRNA expression of ATF-4, CHOP, GADD34 and TRIB3 in MCF-7 breast cancer cellline. According to the obtain results, we demonstrated for the first time thatPimpinelol decreased breast cancer cell viability by inducing ER stress.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
