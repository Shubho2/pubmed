Better control of the local concentrationof silica nanoparticles may facilitate their use as an adjuvant in conjunctionwith ionizing radiation to target cancer cells while preventing damage to normal cells. Hyperbranched polyamidoamine (PAMAM) was grafted onto the surface ofamorphous silica nanoparticles to functionalize them. The PAMAM-coated silicananoparticles (PCSNs) were then conjugated with fluorescent dyes. Anti-HER2antibodies were covalently attached to the labeled PCSNs. The HER2-overexpressingSK-BR3 breast cancer cell line was incubated in medium containing the PCSNprobes. After incubation; the cells were exposed to X-ray radiation. Cells werecounted in all samples using cell proliferation assays; and apoptotic cells were detected. The cell survival results showed that the combination of the targetedPCSN probes and radiation reduced the survival rate of SK-BR3 cells to a greater extent than when either PCSN probes, PCSNs or radiation were appliedindividually. The results also showed an increase in apoptosis in the SK-BR3cells that internalized the PCSN probes and were then irradiated. Based on these data, PCSN probes act as specific radiosensitizing agents for HER2-overexpressingcells.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19030908 PMCID: PMC5877769PMID: 29562708
