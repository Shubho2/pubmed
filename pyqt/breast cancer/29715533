Electronic address: katare@pu.ac.in.The work entails a novel strategy of formulating the lycopene loaded whey proteinisolate nanoparticles (LYC-WPI-NPs) solely using the rational blend ofbiomacromolecule without using equipment-intensive techniques. The LYC-WPI-NPswere fabricated as a substantial drug delivery platform, with maximum entrapment,spatial and controlled release manners, exceptional plasma concentration, andperspective for discrepancy delivery of therapeutics. Prepared nano-formulations were measured in ultra-fine size (100-350 nm) with sphere-shaped. The percentlycopene entrapment of prepared LYC-WPI-NPs was estimated in the range to 50 and 65%. In vitro percent cumulative release study demonstrated deaden and extendedrelease i.e. approximately 75% following 16th h. The in vitro percent cellsurvival (cytotoxicity study) of prepared nanoparticles was evaluated againstMCF-7 breast cancer cells by MTT based colorimetric assay. Sub-cellularlocalization of lycopene when delivered by LYC-WPI-NPs was assessed by HPLC (highperformance liquid chromatography). The WPI-NPs enhance the oral bioavailability of lycopene by controlling its release from nano-formulation and facilitating itsabsorption through lymphatic pathways. Prophylactic anticancer efficacy ofLYC-WPI-NPs was evaluated thereafter on experimentally induced breast canceranimal model. Conclusively, it may quite reasonable that lycopene loaded protein nanoparticles are competent to improve the biopharmaceutical attributes oflycopene and demonstrated prophylactic anticancer activity, decrease tumorproliferation and increase the survival rate of treated animals, thus signifying their feasible usefulness in cancer therapeutic and intervention.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
