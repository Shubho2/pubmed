Using data from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, we exploredfamilial associations of ovarian cancer with other cancers with a novel approach;relative risk for (histology-specific) ovarian cancer was estimated in familieswith patients affected by other cancers, and conversely, risks for other cancers in families with (histology-specific) ovarian cancer patients. Eight discordantcancers were associated with ovarian cancer risk, of which family history ofbreast cancer showed a dose-response (P-trend <0.0001). Conversely, risks ofeight types of cancer increased in families with ovarian cancer patients, anddose-responses were shown for risks of liver (P-trend = 0.0083) and breastcancers (P-trend <0.0001) and cancer of unknown primary (P-trend = 0.0157). Some cancers were only associated with histology-specific ovarian cancers, e.g.endometrial cancer was only associated with endometrioid type but with highestsignificance. Novel associations with virus-linked cancers of the nose and maleand female genitals were found. The results suggest that ovarian cancer sharessusceptibility with a number of other cancers. This might alert geneticcounselors and challenge approaches for gene and gene-environment identification.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29888-4 PMCID: PMC6070489PMID: 30069056
