Software calculation is basedon a physics model of the image acquisition process and incorporates the effectof masking in DM based on accumulated dense tissue areas. VBD (continuously andcategorically) was compared between BT [central projection (mediolateral oblique view (MLO)] and two-view DM, and with radiologists' BI-RADS density 4th ed.scores. Agreement and correlation were investigated with weighted kappa (κ),Spearman's correlation coefficient (r), and Bland-Altman analysis.RESULTS: There was a high correlation (r = 0.83) between VBD in DM and BT andsubstantial agreement between the software breast density categories [observedagreement, 61.3% and 84.8%; κ = 0.61 and ĸ = 0.69 for four (a/b/c/d) and two (fatinvoluted vs. dense) density categories, respectively]. There was moderateagreement between radiologists' BI-RADS scores and software density categories inDM (ĸ = 0.55) and BT (ĸ = 0.47).CONCLUSIONS: In a large public screening setting, we report a substantialagreement between VBD in DM and BT using software with special focus on maskingeffect. This automated and objective mode of measuring VBD may be of value toradiologists and women when BT is used as the primary breast cancer screeningmodality.KEY POINTS: • There was a high correlation between continuous volumetric breastdensity in DM and BT. • There was substantial agreement between software breastdensity categories (four groups) in DM and BT; with clinically warranted binarysoftware breast density categories, the agreement increased markedly. • There wasmoderate agreement between radiologists' BI-RADS scores and software breastdensity categories in DM and BT.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5582-0 PMID: 29943180
