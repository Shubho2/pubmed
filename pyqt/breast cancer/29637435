In this study, using tumour conditioned medium (TCM) derived from breasttumour cell lines - MCF7 and MDA MB 231, we have demonstrated the differentiationof adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) into tumour-associatedfibroblasts (TAFs). Since the Wnt signalling pathway is a key signalling pathway driving breast tumour growth, the effect of the Wnt antagonist secretedfrizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4) was also examined. The response of ADSCs toTCM and sFRP4 treatments was determined by using cell viability assay todetermine the changes in ADSC viability, immunofluorescence for mesenchymalmarkers, glucose uptake assay, and glycolysis stress test using the SeahorseExtracellular Flux analyser to determine the glycolytic activity of ADSCs. ADSCs have been shown to acquire a hyper-proliferative state, significantly increasing their number upon short-term and long-term exposure to TCM. Changes have alsobeen observed in the expression of key mesenchymal markers as well as in themetabolic state of ADSCs. SFRP4 significantly inhibited the differentiation ofADSCs into TAFs by reducing cell growth as well as mesenchymal marker expression (cell line-dependent). However, sFRP4 did not induce further significant changes to the altered metabolic phenotype of ADSCs following TCM exposure. Altogether,this study suggests that the breast tumour milieu may transform ADSCs into atumour-supportive phenotype, which can be altered by Wnt antagonism, but isindependent of metabolic changes.DOI: 10.1007/s12307-018-0210-8 PMCID: PMC6008265PMID: 29637435
