Mesothelin-targetingtherapies are currently being developed. However, the identification of patients potentially eligible for such a therapeutic strategy remains challenging. Theobjective of this study was to perform the radiolabeling and preclinicalevaluation of 99mTc-A1 and 99mTc-C6, two antimesothelin single-domain antibody(sdAb)-derived imaging agents. Methods: A1 and C6 were radiolabeled with 99mTcand evaluated in vitro on recombinant protein and cells, as well as in vivo inxenograft mouse models of the triple-negative breast cancer cell lines HCC70(mesothelin-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (mesothelin-negative). Results: Both99mTc-A1 and 99mTc-C6 bound mesothelin with high affinity in vitro, with 99mTc-A1affinity being 2.4-fold higher than that of 99mTc-C6 (dissociation constant, 43.9± 4.0 vs. 107 ± 16 nM, P < 0.05). 99mTc-A1 and 99mTc-C6 remained stable in vivoin murine blood (>80% at 2 h) and ex vivo in human blood (>90% at 6 h). In vivo99mTc-A1 uptake (percentage injected dose) in HCC70 tumors was 5-fold higher thanin MDA-MB-231 tumors and 1.5-fold higher than that of 99mTc-C6 (2.34% ± 0.36% vs.0.48% ± 0.18% and 1.56% ± 0.43%, respectively, P < 0.01) and resulted in elevatedtumor-to-background ratios. In vivo competition experiments demonstrated thespecificity of 99mTc-A1 uptake in HCC70 tumors. Conclusion: Mesothelin-positivetumors were successfully identified by SPECT using 99mTc-A1 and 99mTc-C6.Considering its superior characteristics, 99mTc-A1 was selected as the mostsuitable tool for further clinical translation.© 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.117.203489 PMID: 29572256
