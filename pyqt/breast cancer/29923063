A confirmatory prevalence study was later performed in othertwo institutions. Finally, a prevention study using prophylactic scalp cooling(PSC) with ELASTO-GEL hypothermia caps in patients receiving adjuvant docetaxelwas performed.RESULTS: In the initial prevalence study (492 patients), minor forms of PA (grade1) were recorded with all chemotherapy regimens and aromatase inhibitors.Patients receiving docetaxel regimens at cumulative dose (CD) ≥ 400 mmg/m2presented a significantly higher prevalence of grades 1 PA (33-52%) and 2 PA(5-12%). Prevalence of grade 2 PA with docetaxel CD ≥ 400 mmg/m2 was confirmed intwo other institutions. Overall, grade 2 PA was seen in 10.06% (95% CI7.36-13.61) of 358 patients with docetaxel regimens reaching CD ≥ 400 mmg/m2, butnot in patients with lower docetaxel CD, other chemotherapy regimens, orendocrine therapy alone. In prevention trial, no grade 2 PA occurred among 116patients receiving adjuvant docetaxel (≥ 400 mmg/m2) and PSC followed-up after a 96 months median time. PSC was well tolerated. No scalp relapses were seen among 30 patients (22% of all inclusions) having disease relapse.CONCLUSION: Adjuvant treatment with docetaxel (CD ≥ 400 mmg/m2) is associatedwith a significant rate of grade 2 PA, leading to wearing a wig, in around 10% ofpatients. This toxicity was completely prevented with scalp cooling. ClinicalTrial Reference: NCT00515762.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4855-2 PMID: 29923063
