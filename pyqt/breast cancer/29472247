However, this phenomenon has not been evaluatedin Asians. In the present study, 4886 patients were recruited from the ShanghaiBreast Cancer Survival Study, a longitudinal study of patients diagnosed during2002-2006, with a median follow-up time of 11.2 years. Cox model incorporatingtime-by-covariate interactions was used to describe the time-varying effects ofprognostic factors related to overall survival and disease-free survival. Age ≥65years showed a progressively negative effect on breast cancer prognosis overtime, whereas tumour size >2 cm had a lasting and constant impact. Agesignificantly modified the effects of the tumour grade, nodal status andoestrogen receptor (ER) status on breast cancer survival. The detrimental effect of poorly differentiated tumours was time limited and more obvious in patientsaged 45-54 years. Having ≥4 positive lymph nodes had a persistent and negativeimpact on prognosis, although it attenuated in later years; the phenomenon wasmore prominent in the 55-64-year age group. ER-positive status was protective in the first 3 years after diagnosis but was related to a higher risk of recurrence in later years; the time-point when ER-positive status turned into a risk factor was earlier in younger patients. These results suggest that older age, positivelymph node status, larger tumour size and ER-positive status are responsible for late death or recurrence in Asian breast cancer survivors. Extended endocrinetherapy should be given earlier in younger ER-positive patients.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-17-0502 PMCID: PMC5862777 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29472247
