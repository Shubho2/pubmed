Previous studieshave shown that the long-term treatment outcomes of BC are significantly impairedby the development of subsequent malignancies. Therefore, in the present study,we evaluated the effect of hormone receptor/HER2 status on subsequentmalignancies in breast cancer survivors.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results*Statdatabase (8.3.4) was used as the data source. We identified 535,941 femalesurvivors with first primary BC through the database from 1973 to 2013. Of these patients, 23,964 had developed subsequent contralateral BC, 8398 had developedsubsequent uterine or ovarian cancer, and 7435 patients had developed subsequent colorectal cancer.RESULTS: Estrogen receptor (ER) positivity and progesterone receptor (PR)positivity were significant protective factors against subsequent BC and ovarian cancer. However, ER+ BC and PR+ BC were significant risk factors for subsequentcolorectal cancer. In addition, HER2+ status demonstrated a marginallysignificant risk effect for subsequent thyroid cancer. Triple-negative(ER-/PR-/HER2-) status showed elevated risk of subsequent breast, ovarian, anduterine cancer.CONCLUSION: ER+/PR+ patients were less likely develop secondary breast andovarian malignancies, possibly owing to advancements in anti-ER/PR treatment.However, ER+/PR+ patients were more likely to develop colorectal cancer,suggesting a potential screening necessity for these patients.Copyright Â© 2018.
