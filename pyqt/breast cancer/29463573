Whether and how a common polymorphism in TP53 at amino acid 72(Pro72Arg; referred to here as P72 and R72) impacts this gain of function has notbeen determined. We show that mutant p53 enhances migration and metastasis oftumors through the ability to bind and regulate PGC-1α and that this regulationis markedly impacted by the codon 72 polymorphism. Tumor cells with the R72variant of mutant p53 show increased PGC-1α function along with greatly increasedmitochondrial function and metastatic capability. Breast cancers containingmutant p53 and the R72 variant show poorer prognosis compared with P72. Thecombined results reveal PGC-1α as a novel "gain-of-function" partner of mutantp53 and indicate that the codon 72 polymorphism influences the impact of mutantp53 on metabolism and metastasis.© 2018 Basu et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.DOI: 10.1101/gad.309062.117 PMCID: PMC5859965PMID: 29463573  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
