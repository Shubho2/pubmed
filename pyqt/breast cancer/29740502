Wesought to assemble publicly available data from Africa to provide estimates ofthe incidence of breast cancer on the continent.Methods: A systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, Global Health and AfricanJournals Online (AJOL) was conducted. We included population- or hospital-basedregistry studies on breast cancer conducted in Africa, and providing estimates ofthe crude incidence of breast cancer among women. A random effects meta-analysis was employed to determine the pooled incidence of breast cancer across studies.Results: The literature search returned 4648 records, with 41 studies conductedacross 54 study sites in 22 African countries selected. We observed importantvariations in reported cancer incidence between population- and hospital-basedcancer registries. The overall pooled crude incidence of breast cancer frompopulation-based registries was 24.5 per 100 000 person years (95% confidenceinterval (CI) 20.1-28.9). The incidence in North Africa was higher at 29.3 per100 000 (95% CI 20.0-38.7) than Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) at 22.4 per 100 000 (95%CI 17.2-28.0). In hospital-based registries, the overall pooled crude incidencerate was estimated at 23.6 per 100 000 (95% CI 18.5-28.7). SSA and NorthernAfrica had relatively comparable rates at 24.0 per 100 000 (95% CI 17.5-30.4) and23.2 per 100 000 (95% CI 6.6-39.7), respectively. Across both registries,incidence rates increased considerably between 2000 and 2015.Conclusions: The available evidence suggests a growing incidence of breast cancerin Africa. The representativeness of these estimates is uncertain due to thepaucity of data in several countries and calendar years, as well as inconsistencyin data collation and quality across existing cancer registries.DOI: 10.7189/jogh.08.010419 PMCID: PMC5903682PMID: 29740502  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
