On thisbackground, the aim of this study was to investigate if patient-experiencedcontinuity of care was associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in breast cancer patients treated at two different-sized breast cancer units.METHODS: In 2016, two questionnaires, "Statements on experienced continuity ofcare" and "The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Qualityof Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)", were sent out to patientsdiagnosed between 2011 and 2014 at two different-sized breast cancer units inSweden. Lead times and other data reflecting medical quality were collected from the patients' medical records and from the National Swedish Breast Cancer QualityRegister.RESULTS: Of 356 eligible patients, 231 (65%) answered the questionnaires, of whom218 patients were included in the analyses. A statistically significantassociation was found between high experienced continuity and high global HRQoL(p = 0.03). Continuity was higher at the smaller unit, while no major differencesbetween the units were found regarding medical quality or lead times.CONCLUSION: The study found that high experienced continuity and HRQoL wasstrongly associated. A statistically significant higher continuity of care wasfound at the smaller unit, in line with what was expected. The absence ofclinically relevant differences in lead times and medical quality may indicatethat continuity could be achieved without loss of quality.DOI: 10.1186/s12913-018-2925-0 PMCID: PMC5819266PMID: 29458376
