The aging population and their increasingburden of comorbidities may not be able to realize the full benefit of treatmentsdue to a combination of the side effects and patient frailty. The aim of thisstudy was to characterize the comorbidities of breast cancer patients and todetermine if the number of comorbidities is a significant contributor tosurvival.Methods: A database including patients from the year 2002 to 2012 was created to include health comorbidities from the electronic medical record. Patients wereclassified into groups according to their number of comorbidities. Disease freeand overall survival was calculated for each patient. A one-way analysis ofvariance was then performed to determine if there was a difference in survival.Results: A total of 279 patients were included: predominately African American(48.7%), female (98.6%) and late middle age (average age =56.1 years). Theaverage number of comorbidities was 2.2 with hypertension and obesity being themost common. Significant differences were found in the number of comorbiditiesbetween African Americans (2.61) and Caucasians (1.78) (P<0.005). Disease freesurvival and overall survival according to number of comorbidities were bothsignificantly different (F=2.775, P<0.008; F=3.684, P<0.001) with a threshold of decreased survival at six comorbidities.Conclusions: The population of women who face breast cancer is heterogeneous witha wide variety of comorbidities, which negatively impact their survival.DOI: 10.21037/gs.2018.02.03 PMCID: PMC5938276PMID: 29770315
