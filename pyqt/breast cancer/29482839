Thelevonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) prevents endometrialcancer, and recent studies suggested that it may also prevent ovarian cancer, butwith a concurrent increased risk of breast cancer. We compared adjusted risks of ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancer in ever users and never users of LNG-IUS.METHODS: Our study cohort consisted of 104,318 women from the Norwegian Women andCancer Study, 9144 of whom were ever users and 95,174 of whom were never users ofLNG-IUS. Exposure information was taken from self-administered questionnaires,and cancer cases were identified through linkage to the Cancer Registry ofNorway. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimatedwith Poisson regression using robust error estimates.RESULTS: Median age at inclusion was 52years and mean follow-up time was 12.5(standard deviation 3.7) years, for a total of 1,305,435 person-years. Among everusers of LNG-IUS there were 18 cases of epithelial ovarian cancer, 15 cases ofendometrial cancer, and 297 cases of breast cancer. When ever users were comparedto never users of LNG-IUS, the multivariable RR of ovarian, endometrial, andbreast cancer was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.88), 0.22 (0.13, 0.40), and 1.03 (0.91,1.17), respectively.CONCLUSION: In this population-based prospective cohort study, ever users ofLNG-IUS had a strongly reduced risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer compared tonever users, with no increased risk of breast cancer.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
