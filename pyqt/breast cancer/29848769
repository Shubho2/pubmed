Furthermore, patients with cancer developing VTE have a worseprognosis than those without cancer. There are no multicentre prospective data onthe occurrence and treatment of VTE in patients with cancer in Japan, and data onthe outcomes, complications and incidence of VTE in these patients have not been reported. In addition, Japanese patients with cancer are traditionally treatedwith unfractionated heparin or warfarin; however, the use of direct oralanticoagulants, which became available in 2014, has not been sufficientlyexamined in this patient group. Therefore, this multicentre, prospective registryhas been designed to capture VTE data from Japanese patients presenting with six cancer types.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This registry will enrol 10 000 patients with colorectal,lung, stomach, breast, gynaecological (including endometrial, cervical, ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal) or pancreatic cancer between March 2017 and March 2019 and follow them for 1 year. We plan to collect data on the incidences ofsymptomatic VTE, bleeding events, stroke, systemic embolic events, incidental VTErequiring treatment in patients, overall survival and symptomatic VTE event-free survival.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All patients will provide written informed consent.Data will remain anonymous and will be collected using an online electronic data capture system. Study protocol, amendments and informed consent forms will beapproved by the institutional review board/independent ethics committee at eachsite prior to study commencement. Results will be disseminated at nationalmeetings and published in peer-reviewed journals.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000024942.Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
