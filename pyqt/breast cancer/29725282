However, fine-needle biopsy is considered equally popular.Aim of the study: To redefine the role of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) inthe diagnosis of breast lesions.Material and methods: We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 680patients who underwent breast ultrasound examination. In most cases, nopathologic structures were observed within the mammary glands. In 321 patients,the presence of focal lesions was revealed, and 107 patients in this groupqualified for FNAB according to current recommendations. Patients with suspicioussmears were referred for core needle or surgical biopsy. Patients with benigncytological smears underwent repeated ultrasound checks at 6-month intervalsduring the following year.Results: All the smears were diagnostic. The vast majority of the results werecategorised as benign lesions. Cancer cells were detected in six women. In onepatient the lesion was classified as suspicious, probably malignant. In all ofthese cases, open biopsy was performed, and histopathological examinationconfirmed the presence of a malignant tumour. The patients were given appropriateoncological treatment. For women with benign or suspicious, but probably benign, lesions, breast ultrasound was performed twice at six-month intervals. Controltests showed no significant changes compared to the baseline examination. None ofthe patients required extensive additional diagnostic tests.Conclusions: FNAB is a reliable method of assessing pathologic lesions in mammaryglands.DOI: 10.5114/pm.2018.74900 PMCID: PMC5925198PMID: 29725282
