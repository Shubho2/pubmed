The authors investigatedwhether prostate-directed treatment with either surgery or radiotherapy versusconservative treatment in the setting of locally advanced or metastatic diseasewas associated with improved survival within a cohort of men from the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Breast and Prostate Cancer Data Qualityand Patterns of Care Study (CDC POC-BP).METHODS: Men diagnosed with locally advanced (cT3-T4 or N+ and M0) or metastatic prostate cancer were identified. The authors compared survival by treatment type,categorized as conservative (androgen deprivation therapy only) versus aggressive(radical prostatectomy or any type of radiotherapy). Nine-year overall survivaland prostate cancer-specific survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meiermethod. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine factorsindependently associated with 9-year prostate cancer-specific survival.RESULTS: For men with advanced, nonmetastatic prostate cancer, conservativetreatment alone was associated with a 4 times higher likelihood of prostatecancer mortality compared with men treated with surgery (hazard ratio, 4.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-12.14). In contrast, no difference was found betweenconservative versus aggressive treatment after adjusting for covariates for menwith metastatic disease. The 9-year prostate cancer-specific survival rate was27% for those receiving aggressive treatment versus 24% for men undergoingconservative treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The authors did not observe a survival advantage with local therapy in addition to standard androgen deprivation therapy for men with metastaticprostate cancer. However, the results of the current study did affirm advantages in the setting of locally advanced disease. Aggressive local therapy in thesetting of metastatic disease needs to be studied carefully before clinicaladoption.
