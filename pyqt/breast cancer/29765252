We studied therelationship between α-2,6 sialyltransferases and the TIL in different breastcancer molecular subgroups.Materials and methods: Immunohistochemical preparations were made from 39 luminal(LUM), 13 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressing (HER2) and 47triple-negative (TN) breast carcinomas. Targeted proteins included ST6Gal-I,ST6Gal-II, ST6GalNac-I, CD8, CD4 and granzyme-B in both cytotoxic T lymphocytesand NK lymphocytes (CTL/NK).Results: CTL/NK populations were significantly more frequent in TN than LUM (P<0.001). TN showed a lower level of ST6Gal-I expression than LUM or HER2 (both P > 0.001). ST6GalNac-I expression was lower in LUM than in TN or HER2 (P = 0.002and P = 0.02, respectively). In HER2, a significant association was found betweena low level of ST6Gal-I expression and a high TIL level. In TN, a significantassociation was observed between a high level of ST6Gal-II expression and a high TIL level.Conclusion: An increase in infiltrating lymphocytes could be influenced by lowexpression of ST6Gal-I in HER2 and by high expression of ST6Gal-II in TN breastcancers. Thus, targeting these sialylation pathways could modulate the levels of TIL.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S162932 PMCID: PMC5942397PMID: 29765252
