The results of PET/CT in detection of lymph node metastases were compared with those obtained afterpathological investigation of axillary biopsy. A four-ring PET subsystem withimage reconstruction using time-of-flight and point-spread function was used withthe radiopharmaceutical dose reduction to 2.5 MBq/kg.RESULTS: Axillary lymph node metastasis was confirmed by histology in 13patients, but metastasis was suspected based on PET/CT in 12 of those patients,the absence of metastasis was surgically confirmed in 17 women, 15 of which were suspected based on PET/CT. The sensitivity for detection of axillary lymph nodemetastasis was 93.3%, with a specificity of 88.2% in the whole patient cohort.Additionally, distant metastatic spread was found in 13.3% of patients.CONCLUSION: The reconstruction of PET images with time-of-flight and point-spreadfunction enabled the improvement of diagnostic performance in N-staging of breastcarcinoma, even when the dose of radiopharmaceutical was reduced to 2.5 MBq/kg.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12706 PMID: 29970542  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
