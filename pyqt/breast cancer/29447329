Vinfluninehas demonstrated single-agent activity in phase II studies in this setting andactivity and tolerability when combined with capecitabine. We compared thecombination of vinflunine plus capecitabine (VC) with single-agent capecitabine.Patients and methods: Patients with locally recurrent/metastatic BC previouslytreated or resistant to an anthracycline and resistant to taxane therapy wererandomly assigned to either vinflunine (280 mg/m2, day 1) plus oral capecitabine [825 mg/m2 twice daily (b.i.d.), days 1-14] every 3 weeks (q3w) or single-agentoral capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 b.i.d., days 1-14) q3w. The primary end point wasprogression-free survival (PFS) assessed by an independent review committee. The study had 90% power to detect a 30% improvement in PFS.Results: Overall, 770 patients were randomised. PFS was significantly longer withVC than with capecitabine alone [hazard ratio, 0.84, 95% confidence interval(CI), 0.71-0.99; log-rank P = 0.043; median 5.6 versus 4.3 months, respectively].Median overall survival was 13.9 versus 11.7 months with VC versus capecitabinealone, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83-1.15; log-rank P = 0.77).No difference in quality of life was observed between the two treatment arms. Themost common adverse events (NCI CTCAE version 3.0) in the combination arm werehaematological and gastrointestinal. Grade 4 neutropenia was more frequent withVC (12% versus 1% with capecitabine alone); febrile neutropenia occurred in 2%versus 0.5%, respectively. Hand-foot syndrome was less frequent with VC (grade 3:4% versus 19% for capecitabine alone). Peripheral neuropathy was uncommon in botharms (grade 3: 1% versus 0.3%).Conclusions: Vinflunine combined with capecitabine demonstrated a modestimprovement in PFS and an acceptable safety profile compared with capecitabinealone in patients with anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated locallyrecurrent/metastatic BC.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01095003.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy063 PMID: 29447329
