China.Integrins are transmembrane glycoproteins that consist of an α and a β subunit.Specific integrin heterodimers preferentially bind to distinct extracellularmatrix (ECM) proteins to affect the characteristics of cells or the components ofthe ECM. Among the different integrins, β1 and β3 integrins serve essential rolesin the progression of different cancer-associated processes, including theinitiation, proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. Furthermore,previous studies have revealed a ratio between these two integrins in cancercells, which also demonstrated that the functions of these two integrins areparadoxical. This indicated that the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cellsare not always parallel and may be considered independently maintained.Additionally, the present review may assist in understanding certain aspects ofcancer, and in making clinical decisions in a novel and more comprehensivemanner.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8076 PMCID: PMC5844128PMID: 29556293
