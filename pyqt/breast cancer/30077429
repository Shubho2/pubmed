The goal of thisstudy was to retrospectively determine the pathologic complete response (pCR)rate for trastuzumab and pertuzumab (HP)-containing regimens compared withtrastuzumab (H)-containing regimens for stage II to III HER2+ BC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 977) with stage II to III HER2+ BC whoreceived neoadjuvant HER2-targeted therapy from 2005 to 2016 and underwentdefinitive breast and axillary lymph node surgery were identified. pCR wasdefined as ypT0/is, ypN0. Univariate/multivariate logistic regression and the χ2 test for comparing proportions was used for the statistical analysis.RESULTS: The pCR rate was higher for the HP group (n = 170) compared with the Hgroup (n = 807): 59% versus 46% (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval,1.21-2.37; P = .0021). After adjustment for clinically important factors (age,date of diagnosis, stage, tumor grade, nodal status, hormone receptor [HR]status, menopausal status, and chemotherapy backbone) the adjusted odds ratio was2.25 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-4.73; P = .032). In multivariate analysis, a significant predictor of pCR in both groups included HR status (HR-negative >HR-positive).CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that HP-containing regimens yield higherpCR rates compared with H-containing regimens in patients with stage II to IIIHER2+ BC in clinical practice regardless of chemotherapy backbone.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
