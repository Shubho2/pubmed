Brazil is goingthrough a rapid demographic expansion, and studies of this relationship are also needed in such unexplored settings. Methods: We assessed the relationship betweenalcohol consumption and breast cancer risk among 1,506 Brazilian women (406 casesand 1,100 controls). Regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR)and 95% confidence intervals (CI). All statistical tests were two-tailed.Results: The mean age of the 1,506 women was 42.0 (standard deviation, ±15.0)years. There was a significant association between breast cancer and age, bodymass index, age at menarche, menstrual flow and menstrual cycle. Multivariateanalysis showed an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in regular alcoholconsumers (<50 years old: OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.4–16.2; ≥50 years old: OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.2–13.4) compared with abstainers or occasional drinkers. Women with a regularalcohol intake for 10 years or more who were less than 50 years old had athreefold higher risk of developing breast cancer (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.2–7.6).Conclusion: Regular alcohol consumption increases the risk of breast cancermainly among women less than 50 years old.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.3.703 PMCID: PMC5980845PMID: 29580044
