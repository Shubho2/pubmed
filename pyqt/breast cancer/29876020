Although several etiological factors such as anemia, depression, chronic inflammation, neurological pathology andalterations in metabolism have been proposed, the mechanisms of CRF are largelyunknown.Methods: We conducted a pilot, prospective, case-control study to estimate themagnitude of change in thyroid function in breast cancer patients from baselineto 24 months, compared to cancer-free, age-matched controls. Secondary objectiveswere to correlate changes in thyroid function and obesity over time with fatigue symptoms scores in this patient population.Results: The proportion of women with breast cancer who developed subclinical or overt hypothyroidism (TSH >4.0 mIU/L) from baseline to year 1 was significantlygreater compared to controls (9.6% vs. 5%; p=0.02). Subjects with breast cancerreported significantly worse fatigue symptoms than age-matched controls, asindicated by higher disruption indices (p<0.001 at baseline, p=0.02 at year 1,p=0.09 at year 2). Additionally, a significant interaction effect on disruptionindex score (p=0.019), general level of activity over time (p=0.006) and normalwork activity (p= 0.002) was observed in the subgroup of women with BMI>30.Conclusion: Screening breast cancer patients for thyroid function status atbaseline and serially post-treatment to evaluate the need for thyroid hormonereplacement may provide for a novel strategy for treating chemotherapy-inducedfatigue.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25438 PMCID: PMC5986636PMID: 29876020
