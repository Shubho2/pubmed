Nowadays, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention may be possible thanks to the application of nanotechnology toclinical practice. Taking into consideration the different forms of BC and thedisease status, nanomaterials can be designed to meet the most forefrontobjectives of modern therapy and diagnosis. We have analyzed in detail three maingroups of nanomaterial applications for BC treatment and diagnosis. We haveidentified several types of drugs successfully conjugated with nanomaterials. We have analyzed the main important imaging techniques and all nanomaterials used tohelp the non-invasive, early detection of the lesions. Moreover, we have examinedtheranostic nanomaterials as unique tools, combining imaging, detection, andtherapy for BC. This state of the art review provides a useful guide depictinghow nanotechnology can be used to overcome the current barriers in BC clinicalpractice, and how it will shape the future scenario of treatments, prevention,and diagnosis, revolutionizing the current approaches, e.g., reducing thesuffering related to chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1039/c8nr02796j PMID: 29917035
