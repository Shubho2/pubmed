Herewith, we designed a biocompatible drug delivery system containing the calcium carbonate microparticles (CaCO3 MPs) that coated with the alternativelycharged polyelectrolytes, i.e., poly-L-ornithine (PLO)/fucoidan by LbLself-assembly process (LbL MPs). Upon coating with the polyelectrolytes, the meanparticle size of MPs obtained from SEM observations increased from 1.91 to2.03 μm, and the surface of LbL MPs was smoothened compared to naked CaCO3 MPs.In addition, the reversible zeta potential changes have confirmed theaccomplishment of layer upon a layer assembly. To evaluate the efficiency ofcancer therapeutics, we loaded doxorubicin (Dox) in the LbL MPs, which resultedin high (69.7%) drug encapsulation efficiency. The controlled release of Doxresulted in the significant antiproliferative efficiency in breast cancer cellline (MCF-7 cells), demonstrating the potential of applying this innovative drug delivery system in the biomedical field.DOI: 10.1007/s10856-018-6075-z PMID: 29748879
