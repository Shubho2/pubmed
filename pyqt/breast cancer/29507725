A 70-year-old womanwas referred to our hospital with right shoulder blade pain and paresthesia over the right upper breast. Chest X-ray and computed tomography demonstrated a 5 cmright apical mass in the chest. Biopsy of the mass demonstrated features ofdesmoid fibromatosis. The patient subsequently underwent surgical resection ofthe mass and received adjuvant radiation therapy for microscopic positivemargins. In conclusion, although desmoid tumour of the chest is rare, it is worthconsidering in the differential diagnoses of chest wall tumours.DOI: 10.1002/rcr2.310 PMCID: PMC5830061PMID: 29507725
