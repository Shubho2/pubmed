Weevaluated the use of different tumor resection margin guidelines and investigatedtheir impact on positive margin rates (PMR) and reoperation rates (RR). Thirteen guidelines reporting on the extent of a positive margin were reviewed along with 31 studies, published between 2011 and 2016, reporting on a well-defined PMR.Studies were categorized according to the margin definition. Pooled PMR and RRwere determined with random-effect models. For invasive breast cancer, mostguidelines recommend a positive margin of tumor on ink. However, definitions ofreported positive margins in the clinic vary from more than focally positive tothe presence of tumor cells within 3 to 5 mm from the resection surface. Withinthe studies analyzed (59,979 patients), pooled PMRs for invasive breast cancerranged from 9% to 36% and pooled RRs from 77% to 99%. For DCIS, guidelines varybetween no DCIS on the resection surface to DCIS cells found within a distance of2 mm from the resection edge. Pooled PMRs for DCIS varied from 4% to 23% (840patients). Given the differences in tumor margin definition between countriesworldwide, quality control data expressed as PMR or RR should be interpreted withcaution. Furthermore, the overall definition for positive resection margins forboth invasive disease and DCIS seems to have become more liberal.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
