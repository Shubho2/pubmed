Stress is an imminent risk factor with a documented negative impact onneuro-endocrine and immune system. Numerous epidemiological studies haveinvestigated the link between stress and cancer, reporting contradictory results from no association to a close causal link. The impact of the topic and the lack of conclusion compelled this systematic review.Methods: A systematic review was carried out, including all literature studiesfrom 1966 to 2016, investigating the relationship between stress and theoccurrence of breast cancer. Of the 1813 articles identified in thePubMed/Medline database, 52 were eligible and included in the analysis.Results: A number of 17 retrospective, 20 limited prospective and 15 prospective studies were analyzed. The number of patients exceeded 29,000, for a total numberof more than 700.000 women recruited from hospital, screening cohorts orpopulation registers. We identified 26 positive articles linking personal traits,stressful events and breast cancer, 18 negative articles that did not confirmtheir hypothesis and 8 articles that could not be classified. Facingheterogeneity, all possible misguiding factors such as: study design, informationgathering, stress type, moment of exposure, individual susceptibility andpersonality, were discussed independently.Conclusions: Qualitative analysis of articles has revealed a possible associationbetween stress and cancer, especially regarding stressful life events. In theabsence of a meta-analysis and taking into account the methodologicalheterogeneity of the studies, the results are difficult to interpret and the roleof chance is difficult to exclude.DOI: 10.15386/cjmed-924 PMCID: PMC5808262PMID: 29440947
