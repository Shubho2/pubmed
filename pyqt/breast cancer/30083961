[Epub ahead ofprint]Global trends in the distribution of cancer types among patients in oncologyphase I trials, 1991-2015.Itahashi K(1), Shimizu T(1), Koyama T(1), Kondo S(1), Fujiwara Y(1), YamamotoN(2).Author information: (1)Department of Experimental Therapeutics, National Cancer Center Hospital,5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.(2)Department of Experimental Therapeutics, National Cancer Center Hospital,5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan. nbryamam@ncc.go.jp.Background Systematic analyses regarding cancer types of patients enrolled inoncology phase I trials are scarce. The global distribution, time-dependentchange, and regional differences were evaluated. Methods A systematic search ofthe PubMed database, in which all single-agent phase I trials permitting theenrollment of all-comer patients with any type of solid tumor published betweenJanuary 1991 and December 2015 were specified, was performed. Trials expected to enroll specific patient populations were excluded according to predefinedcriteria. Results Eight hundred and sixty-six eligible trials, which had enrolled29,112 advanced solid tumor patients, were identified. Colorectal (n = 7510;25.8%) and lung cancer (n = 3212; 11.0%) were the most prevalent solid tumors,followed by sarcoma (n = 1756; 6.0%), breast cancer (n = 1623; 5.6%), and renalcancer (n = 1589; 5.5%). The proportion of patients with either colorectal orlung cancer tended to decrease over time. The proportion of trials, in whichpatients with either of these two cancers accounted for ≥50.0% of the totalnumber of patients in each trial, also decreased: 33 of 67 trials (31/67) (46.3%)in 1991-1995, 58/142 (40.8%) in 1996-2000, 59/223 (26.5%) in 2001-2005, 38/189(20.1%) in 2006-2010, and 41/245 (16.7%) in 2011-2015. Instead, the proportion ofpatients with various types of cancer increased, leading to diversification ofenrolled patients. Conclusions The distribution of cancer types among patients inphase I trials has changed. The comprehensive review of the distribution of solidtumor types could contribute to flexible trial designs and optimal patientrecruitment.DOI: 10.1007/s10637-018-0654-1 PMID: 30083961
