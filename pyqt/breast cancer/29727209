Silencing the RHBDF1 gene in breast cancer xenograft tumors leads to inhibition of tumorgrowth. We show in this study that artificially raising RHBDF1 protein levels in the mammary epithelial cells MCF-10A results in severe perturbations of theability of the cells to form lumen-containing acini, either in 3-dimensional cellcultures or implanted in mouse mammary fat pads. Knocking down RHBDF1 with short hairpin (sh)RNA leads to restoration of acinus formation. Consistently, RHBDF1overexpression gives rise to disordered distribution of polarity markers GM130and laminin-5, which otherwise are located in apical and basal positions,respectively, in the acini. Further investigations reveal that RHBDF1 directlybinds to Par6a, a component of a protein complex consisting ofpartitioning-defective scaffold protein (Par)6, Par3, renin-angiotensinsystem-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac)1, and cell-division cycle(Cdc)42, which is structurally critical to the formation of apicobasal polarity. RHBDF1 binding to Par6a results in collapse of the protein complex and thusdisruption of polarity formation. Since early stages of breast cancer arecharacterized by the loss of mammary gland epithelial cell polarity, our findingsindicate that perturbations of apicobasal polarity by high levels of RHBDF1 is a significant attribute in the development of breast neoplasia.-Peng, X.-M., Gao,S., Deng, H.-T., Cai, H.-X., Zhou, Z., Xiang, R., Zhang, Q.-Z., Li, L.-Y.Perturbation of epithelial apicobasal polarity by rhomboid family-1 geneoverexpression.DOI: 10.1096/fj.201800016R PMID: 29727209
