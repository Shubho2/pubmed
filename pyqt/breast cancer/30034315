Ligand-independent activation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is alsoassociated with carcinogenesis. The activity of ERα is modulated throughphosphorylation on multiple sites by a number of protein kinases. Here weinvestigated the effect of visfatin as a novel adipocytokine on thephosphorylation and activity of ERα in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We showed that exogenous administration of visfatin significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERα at serine 118 (Ser118) and 167 (Ser167) residues. Visfatin-induced Ser118 phosphorylation was diminished after treatment of cells with U0126 (MEK1/2inhibitor). Furthermore, our results showed that visfatin-induced Ser167phosphorylation is mediated through both MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of visfatin by FK866 had no effect onphosphorylation of ERα. We also showed that visfatin enhanced the estrogenresponse element (ERE)-dependent activity of ER in the presence of 17-β estradiol(E2). Additional study on T47D cells showed that visfatin also increased Ser118and Ser167 phosphorylation of ERα and enhanced ERE-dependent activity in thepresence of E2 in these cells.DOI: 10.17179/excli2018-1299 PMCID: PMC6046625PMID: 30034315
