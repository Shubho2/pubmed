It was found that Que, Q3'S, and Q3Gcould inhibit the growth of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependentmanner, with the IC50 values of 23.1, 27.6, and 73.2 μM, respectively, and their anticancer effect was ranked as Que > Q3'S > Q3G. Furthermore, flow cytometricassay revealed that Que, Q3'S, and Q3G mediated the cell-cycle arrest principallyat the S phase and decreased the number of G0/G1 and G2/M after a 48 h treatment with human breast MCF-7 cells. Moreover, it was found that 70.8%, 58.2%, and48.0% of MCF-7 cancer cells entered the early phase of apoptosis when treatedwith 100 μM Que, Q3'S, and Q3G for 48 h, respectively. In addition, induction of apoptosis by Que, Q3'S, and Q3G was accompanied by marginal generation ofintracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the MCF-7 cancer cells. Overall,these results demonstrate that Que, Q3'S, and Q3G possess strong antitumoreffects through induction of an ROS-dependent apoptosis pathway in MCF-7 cells.DOI: 10.1039/c7fo01964e PMID: 29497723
