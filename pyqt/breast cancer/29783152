Electronic address:ngsahoo@yahoo.co.in.In this work, the modification of graphene oxides (GOs) have been done withhydrophilic and biodegradable polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and otherexcipient β -cyclodextrin (β-CD) through covalent functionalization for efficientloading and compatible release of sparingly water soluble aromatic anticancerdrug SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxy camptothecin). The drug was loaded onto bothGO-PVP and GO-β-CD through the π-π interactions.The release of drug from both thenanocarriers were analyzed in different pH medium of pH 7 (water, neutralmedium), pH 5 (acidic buffer) and pH 12 (basic buffer). The loading capacity and the cell killing activity of SN-38 loaded on functionalized GO were investigated comprehensively in human breast cancer cells MCF-7.Our findings shown that thecytotoxicity of SN-38 loaded to the polymer modified GO was comparatively higher than free SN-38. In particular, SN-38 loaded GO-PVP nanocarrier has morecytotoxic effect than GO-β-CD nanocarrier against MCF-7 cells, indicating thatSN-38 loaded GO-PVP nanocarrier can be used as promising material for drugdelivery and biological applications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
