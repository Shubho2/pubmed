Electronic address: mkhazaei1345@yahoo.com.AIMS: Breast cancer is the most common cancer of women. The aim of this study wasto investigate the synergic effect of raloxifene (Ral) and resveratrol (Res) onapoptosis of breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231).MAIN METHODS: Cells were treated with Ral and Res alone and in combination. Cell viability (MTT assay), apoptosis (TUNEL assay) and nitric oxide (NO) production(Griess method) were investigated. Expression of proapoptotic gene (Bax and p53),anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl2) and caspases-3, caspase -8 were evaluated. One-wayANOVA test was used for data analysis.KEY FINDINGS: The viabilities of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated by Ral (1 μM) and Res (20 μM) decreased significantly (p = 0.000) and their synergic use showedmore reduction. Nitric oxide production by MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells exposed uponeach drug alone and in combination showing a significant reduction (p = 0.000).There was also an increase in apoptosis in the cells treated with combination useof Ral and Res in both cell lines. Moreover, reduced expression of Bcl2 andincreased expression of Bax and p53 genes were observed.SIGNIFICANCE: The synergic effects of Ral and Res through increased ratio ofBcl2/Bax and expressions of p53, caspase-3 and caspase-8 genes indicating abetter therapeutic effect on breast cancer cells relative to each drug alone.Combination of Res and Ral via increased expression of apoptotic genes including Bax, p53 and caspase-3 and caspase-8 is able to promote apoptosis as amitochondrial dependent pathway in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. The synergic effect wasmore potent in MCF7 estrogen receptor positive cell line.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.lfs.2018.04.035 PMID: 29705353  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
