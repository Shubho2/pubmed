Rh2(suc)4 has beencharacterized by elemental analysis, potentiometric titration, TGA, MS, FTIR and UV-Vis analysis. The maghemite phase was confirmed by XRD, and a diameter of 10nm was obtained by Sherrer equation. The VSM experiment showed superparamagnetic properties. TEM showed nanoparticles with a spherical shape and a mean diameterof 8.5±0.4 and 9.1 ± 0.4 nm for MGH-2L/Rh2(suc)4 and MGH-2L/Rh2(suc)4/BSA,respectively. FTIR and TGA confirmed the immobilization of Rh2(suc)4 and bovineserum albumin adsorption on superparamagnetic iron oxide. Hydrodynamic size (DH) and zeta potential (ζ) measurements were made in aqueous, NaCl and DMEM media. DHfor dispersions was lower in aqueous medium, but increased in saline and DMEMmedia. In aqueous and saline media, ζ was not altered for MGH-2L andMGH-2L/Rh2(suc)4, but was significantly lower for MGH-2L/Rh2(suc)4/BSA.Therefore, MGH-2L/Rh2(suc)4/BSA was the most stable dispersion, meaning that BSA coating prevents aggregation more than lauric acid bilayer coating.MGH-2L/Rh2(suc)4 and MGH-2L/Rh2(suc)4/BSA dispersions induced cytotoxicity inbreast carcinoma (MCF-7) and fibroblast cells in culture, and this effect washigher than that exerted by free Rh2(suc)4 and more specific to breast carcinoma cells than to fibroblasts. Therefore, we suggest that these dispersions have animportant potential for future clinical applications and, thus, they should beconsidered a platform to enhance Rh2(suc)4 cytotoxicity, specifically in breastcarcinoma.DOI: 10.1166/jnn.2018.15021 PMID: 29442716  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
