In this study, we hypothesize a role ofvariants in the ATM, H2AFX and MRE11 genes in determining breast cancer (BC)susceptibility.METHODS: We examined the whole sequence of the ATM kinase domain and estimatedthe frequency of founder mutations in the ATM gene (c.5932G > T, c.6095G > A, andc.7630-2A > C) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in H2AFX (rs643788,rs8551, rs7759, and rs2509049) and MRE11 (rs1061956 and rs2155209) among 315breast cancer patients and 515 controls. The analysis was performed usinghigh-resolution melting for new variants and the polymerase chainreaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method for recurrentATM mutations. H2AFX and MRE11 polymorphisms were analyzed using TaqMan assays.The cumulative genetic risk scores (CGRS) were calculated using unweighted andweighted approaches.RESULTS: We identified four mutations (c.6067G > A, c.8314G > A, c.8187A > T, andc.6095G > A) in the ATM gene in three BC cases and two control subjects. Weobserved a statistically significant association of H2AFX variants with BC. Risk alleles (the G of rs7759 and the T of rs8551 and rs2509049) were observed morefrequently in BC cases compared to the control group, with P values, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 0.0018, 1.47 (1.19 to 1.82); 0.018,1.33 (1.09 to 1.64); and 0.024, 1.3 (1.06 to 1.59), respectively. Haplotype-basedtests identified a significant association of the H2AFX CACT haplotype with BC(P <  0.0001, OR = 27.29, 95% CI 3.56 to 209.5). The risk of BC increased withthe growing number of risk alleles. The OR (95% CI) for carriers of ≥ four riskalleles was 1.71 (1.11 to 2.62) for the CGRS.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that H2AFX variants are associated with anincreased risk of BC. The above-reported sequence variants of MRE11 genes may notconstitute a risk factor of breast cancer in the Polish population. Thecontribution of mutations detected in the ATM gene to the development of breastcancer needs further detailed study.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4360-3 PMCID: PMC5910560PMID: 29678143
