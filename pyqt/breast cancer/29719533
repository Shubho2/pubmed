IDO has also received more attention because of its non-immunefunctions including regulating angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was toinvestigate the effects of IDO on microvessel density (MVD), and to explore itsprognostic role in breast cancer. We showed IDO expression was positivelycorrelated with MVD labeled by CD105 (MVD-CD105) rather than MVD labeled by CD31 (MVD-CD31) in breast cancer specimens. Both IDO expression and MVD-CD105 levelwere associated with initial TNM stage, histological grade, and tumor-draininglymph nodes (TDLNs) metastasis in breast cancer. In the prognostic analysis,TDLNs metastasis, an advanced TNM stage (III) and high histological grade (III)significantly predicted shorter survival in univariate analysis. Concentrating onIDO and MVD, the patients with IDO expression or high MVD level had poorerprognosis compared with no IDO expression [P = 0.047 for progress-free survival(PFS)] and low MVD level (P = 0.019 for OS); the patients with IDO expression andhigh MVD level had a tendency with shorter overall survival when compared withnon IDO expression, low MVD level, or both (P = 0.062 for OS). In multivariateanalysis, an advanced TNM stage (III) was significantly associated with shorter5-year survival rate of PFS (HR: 0.126, 95% CI: 0.024-0.669, P = 0.015). In orderto verify the phenomenon of IDO promoting angiogenesis, we contained the study invitro. We detected the expression of IDO mRNA in breast cancer cell lines andmeasured the concentration of tryptophan and kynurenine in the supernatants ofMCF-7 by high performance liquid chromatography. The ratio of Kyn and trp(kyn/trp) was calculated to estimate IDO-enzyme activity. MCF-7 cells, whichproduce high level of IDO and metabolize tryptophan, promoted human umbilicalvein endothelial cells (HUVEC) proliferation significantly in co-culture system. Meanwhile IDO could upregulate the expression of CD105 in HUVEC, which wasdownregulated after adding IDO inhibitor, 1-methyl-d-trytophan. These resultssuggest that IDO could promote angiogenesis in breast cancer, providing a novel, potentially effective molecular or gene therapy target for angiogenesisinhibition in the future.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00724 PMCID: PMC5913323PMID: 29719533
