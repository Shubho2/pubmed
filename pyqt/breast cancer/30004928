Ageneralized linear model with a Poisson distribution and logistic regression was used with incidence rate ratios (IRR) and difference-in-differences (DID).RESULTS: There were 317, 858 patients in our sample which included those withprivate insurance, Medicaid, or no insurance. Pancreas, breast, colorectal,prostate, and gastric CA admissions significantly increased in expansion statesbut decreased in nonexpansion states. (IRR 1.12, 1.14, 1.11, 1.34, 1.23; P < .05)Lung and colorectal CA surgeries (IRR 1.30, 1.25; P < .05) increased, whilebreast CA surgeries (IRR 1.25; P < .05) decreased less in expansion states.Government subsidized, or self-pay patients had greater odds of undergoing lung, bladder, and colorectal CA surgery (OR 0.45 vs 0.33; 0.60 vs 0.48; 0.47 vs 0.39; P < .05) in expansion states after reform.CONCLUSIONS: In states that expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA, the rate ofsurgeries for colorectal and lung CA increased significantly, while breast CAsurgeries decreased less. Parenthetically, these cancers are subject topopulation screening programs. We conclude that expanding insurance coverageresults in enhanced access to cancer surgery.DOI: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000002952 PMID: 30004928
