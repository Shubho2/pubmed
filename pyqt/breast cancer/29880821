Thus, moreeffective therapeutic strategies are needed for the management of TNBC. Wedemonstrated that the stimulation of apoptosis by the binding of secretedacetylated-apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox factor-1 (Ac-APE1/Ref-1) tothe receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was essential for TNBCcell death in response to hyperacetylation. The aim of the present study was toassess the potential therapeutic efficacy of secretory Ac-APE1/Ref-1 inorthotopic TNBC xenografts in vivo. We found that hyperacetylation in xenografts caused secretion of Ac-APE1/Ref-1 into the blood, where the factor bound directlyto RAGE in hyperacetylated tumor tissues. Hyperacetylation in the TNBC xenograftsinduced strong inhibition of tumor growth and development, leading to apoptoticcell death, accompanied by increased RAGE expression and generation of reactiveoxygen species. Tissues exhibited markedly higher counts of apoptotic bodies, areduced proliferation index, and reduced neovascularization compared with controltumors. Ac-APE1/Ref-1-stimulated apoptosis was markedly reduced in RAGE-knockdowntumors compared with RAGE-overexpressing tumors, even in the presence ofhyperacetylation. The function of secreted Ac-APE1/Ref-1 was confirmed in otherhyperacetylated TNBCs xenografts using BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 cells, demonstratingits relevance as an anti-cancer molecule.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27025-9 PMCID: PMC5992149PMID: 29880821
