Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2018 Jul;16(7):491-501.Development of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors in the treatment ofBRCA-mutated breast cancer.Sulai NH(1), Tan AR(1).Author information: (1)Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, North Carolina.The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) 1 and 2 are DNA-binding enzymes thatplay a critical role in the repair of DNA. The use of PARP inhibitors is arational therapeutic approach to selectively killing a subset of cancer cellswith deficiencies in DNA repair pathways. PARP inhibitors that have undergoneclinical investigation in the treatment of breast cancer include olaparib,talazoparib, veliparib, niraparib, and rucaparib. The antitumor activity of PARP inhibitors as single agents has been demonstrated in BRCA-associated metastaticbreast cancer. In 2018, olaparib became the first oral PARP inhibitor to receive approval in the United States for the treatment of advanced BRCA-mutated breastcancer, an approval that represents a major change in the treatment paradigm for this subtype of breast cancer. PARP inhibition plus chemotherapy and PARPinhibition plus immunotherapy are novel approaches undergoing extensive study in breast cancer. This review focuses on the clinical development of PARP inhibitorsadministered singly or in combination with other agents for early-stage andmetastatic BRCA-mutated breast cancer.PMID: 30067621
