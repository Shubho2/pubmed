Electronic address:bifeng@medmail.com.cn.High expression levels of CD44 and YAP have been identified as poor prognosticfactors in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanistic relationship between CD44 and YAP during HCC tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. Toinvestigate the mutual regulation between standard CD44 (CD44S) and YAP1 in HCCcell lines and tissue samples, CD44S and YAP1 expression in 40 pairs of tumorsamples and matched distal normal tissues from HCC patients was examined byimmunohistochemical staining. High expression of either CD44S or YAP1 wasassociated with a younger age and worse pathology grade. In addition, high levelsof CD44S and YAP1 were associated with increased vascular invasion and moresevere liver cirrhosis, respectively. CD44S expression was positively correlated with YAP1 expression in these HCC tissues. In vitro experiments suggested thatCD44S could positively regulate the expression of YAP1 and its target genes viathe PI3K/Akt pathway in HCC cells. Moreover, CD44S is regulated by the YAP1/TEAD axis. These results reveal a novel positive feedback loop involving CD44S andYAP1, in which CD44S functions as both an upstream regulator and a downstreameffector of YAP1 in HCC. This feedback loop might constitute a broadly conserved module for regulating cell proliferation and invasion during HCC tumorigenesis.Blocking this positive feedback loop that involves CD44S and YAP1 might representa new approach for HCC treatment.Copyright Â© 2018.
