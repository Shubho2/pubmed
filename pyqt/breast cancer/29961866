While advancements inearly detection and therapeutic options have led to a significant decrease inmortality, response to treatment is affected by the genetic heterogeneity of the disease. Recent genome-wide DNA mutation analyses revealed the existence ofhundreds of low-frequency mutated genes, in addition to known cancer drivers: afinding that is prompting research into the impact of these genes on thepathogenesis of the disease.Results: Herein, we describe a strategy towards the characterization of the role of low-frequency mutated genes in breast cancer. Through the combined analyses ofpublicly available gene expression and mutational datasets, we identified severalCancer Gene Modules (CMs) that we re-organized in Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN) enriched in low-frequency mutated genes. Importantly, these low-frequency mutatedgenes were mutually exclusive with known cancer drivers. Finally, we provideevidence that gene expression analysis of these mutated GRNs can predictresistance/sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs for breast cancer treatment.Availability: Datasets are available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ and at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/datasets/.
