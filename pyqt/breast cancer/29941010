The aim of this study is to characterize thelandscape of ERBB2 mutations in solid tumors and the potential efficacy of ERBB2 targeting.We analyzed the next-generation sequencing results from 17,878 patientswith solid tumors and reported the outcome of 4 patients with advancedERBB2-mutated tumors treated with a combination of trastuzumab andlapatinib.ERBB2 mutations occurred in 510 patients (2.85%). The tumor types with the highest incidence of ERBB2 mutations were the following: bladder (16.6%),small bowel (8.6%), ampullar (6.5%), skin non-melanoma (6.1%), and cervicalcancer (5.5%). 49.4% (n = 282) were known as activating mutations. ERBB2 mutationwas not mutually exclusive of ERBB2 amplification which occurred in up to 10% of cases. PI3KCA activating mutations were associated with ERBB2 mutations in 12.4% of cases mainly in breast and lung cancer. Four patients (endometrial,colorectal, cholangiocarcinoma, and adenosarcoma of the uterus) were treated witha combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib. All of them experienced tumorshrinkage resulting in stable disease in three cases and partial response in one case. One patient developed secondary resistance. Sequencing of the progressingmetastasis allowed the identification of the ERBB2 L869R mutation previouslyassociated with resistance to lapatinib in vitro.These results support furtherclinical investigation aiming to demonstrate that ERBB2-mutational driven therapycan improve patient care irrespective of histology.DOI: 10.1186/s13045-018-0630-4 PMCID: PMC6019715PMID: 29941010
