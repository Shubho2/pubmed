While hormonal- and antibody-targetedtherapies are effective in the patients with luminal and HER-2 subtypes, thepatients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype do not benefit fromthese therapies. The incidence rates of TNBC subtype are higher inAfrican-American women, and the evidence indicates that these women have worseprognosis compared to women of European descent. The reasons for this disparityremain unclear but are often attributed to TNBC biology. In this study, weperformed metabolic analysis of breast tissues to identify how TNBC differs from luminal A breast cancer (LABC) subtypes within the African-American and Caucasianbreast cancer patients, respectively. We used High-Resolution Magic AngleSpinning (HR-MAS) 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to perform the metabolomic analysis of breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues (total n=82 samples). TNBC and LABC subtypes in African American women exhibited different metabolicprofiles. Metabolic profiles of these subtypes were also distinct from thoserevealed in Caucasian women. TNBC in African-American women expressed higherlevels of glutathione, choline, and glutamine as well as profound metabolicalterations characterized by decreased mitochondrial respiration and increasedglycolysis concomitant with decreased levels of ATP. TNBC in Caucasian women was associated with increased pyrimidine synthesis. These metabolic alterations couldpotentially be exploited as novel treatment targets for TNBC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24433 PMCID: PMC5837744PMID: 29545929
