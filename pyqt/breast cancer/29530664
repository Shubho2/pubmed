Preliminary results at ourcentre showed that locoregional spread of vulvar carcinoma occurs within tissuedomains defined by stepwise embryonic and fetal development (ontogenetic cancerfields and associated lymph node regions). We propose that clinical translationof these insights into practice could improve outcomes of surgical treatment ofvulvar cancer.METHODS: We did a single-centre prospective trial at the University of Leipzig's Cancer Center. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had ontogeneticstage 1-3b histologically proven primary carcinoma of the vulva, and had notundergone previous surgical or radiotherapy treatment for vulvar cancer or anyother major perineal or pelvic disease. In view of staged morphogenesis of thevulva from the cloacal membrane endoderm at Carnegie stage 11 to adulthood, wedefined the tissue domains of tumour spread according to the theory ofontogenetic cancer fields. On the basis of ontogenetic staging, patients weretreated locally with partial, total, or extended vulvar field resection;regionally with therapeutic inguinopelvic lymph node dissection; and anatomicalreconstruction without adjuvant radiotherapy. The primary endpoints wererecurrence-free survival, disease-specific survival, and early postoperativecomplications. Analysis of tumour spread and early postoperative surgicalcomplications was done by intention to treat (ie, all patients were included),whereas outcome analyses were done per protocol. This ongoing trial is registeredwith the German Clinical Trials Register, number DRKS00013358.FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2009, and June 8, 2017, 97 consecutive patients wereincluded in the study, of whom 94 were treated per protocol with vulvar fieldresection, therapeutic inguinopelvic lymph node dissection, and anatomicalreconstruction without adjuvant radiotherapy. 46 patients had moderate or severe postoperative complications, especially infectious perineal and inguinal wounddehiscence. 3-year recurrence-free survival in all patients was 85·1% (95% CI76·9-93·3), and 3-year disease-specific survival was 86·0% (78·2-93·8).INTERPRETATION: Our results support the theory of ontogenetic cancer fields forvulvar carcinoma, accord with our previous findings in cervical cancer, andsuggest the general applicability of the theory. Application of the concept ofcancer field resection could improve outcomes in patients with vulvar carcinoma, but needs to be investigated further in multicentre randomised controlled trials.FUNDING: Leipzig School of Radical Pelvic Surgery and Gynecologic OncologyResearch Foundation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
