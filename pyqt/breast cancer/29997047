Benzylidenes exhibit significant antiproliferative effect on cellsand inhibit cell growth in hormone-dependent MCF-7 and hormone-independentMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Compound 3d exhibits the highest activityagainst two breast cancer cell lines, with the IC50 value of about 2 µM.Compounds 3e,m,n display considerable selectivity for hormone-dependent breastcancer cells, with the IC50 value lower than 6 µM. Moreover, these steroidalbenzylidenes regulate ERα signaling and reveal p53-independent mechanism ofpro-apoptotic action in MCF-7 cells. The new class of antitumor compounds holdspromise as the basis for the design of agents for cancer therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
