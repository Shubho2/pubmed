We estimated average total monthly and annual costs in the 12 monthspreceding, month of, and 12 months following the index de novo/recurrence date,stratified by age at diagnosis (<65, ≥65). Generalized linear repeated-measuresmodels controlled for demographics and comorbidity.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the pre-index period, monthly costs were higher forrecurrent than for de novo breast (<65: +$2,431; ≥65: +$1,360), colorectal (<65: +$3,219; ≥65: +$2,247), and lung cancer (<65: +$3,086; ≥65: +$2,260) patients.Conversely, during the index and post-index periods, costs were higher for denovo patients. Average total annual pre-index costs were five- to ninefold higherfor recurrent versus de novo patients <65.CONCLUSIONS: Cost differences by type of advanced cancer and by age suggestheterogeneous patterns of care that merit further investigation.© Health Research and Educational Trust.DOI: 10.1111/1475-6773.13014 PMID: 30043542
