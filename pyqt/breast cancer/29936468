She underwent surgery resectionfollowed by stereotactic radiotherapy and, because of early brain progression,she was submitted to the first line therapy with pertuzumab, trastuzumab andweekly paclitaxel. After six months of treatment, a brain magnetic resonanceimaging revealed a complete disappearance of brain recurrence, which persistedfor more than 24 months.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11317 PMID: 29936468
