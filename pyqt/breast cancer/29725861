[Epub ahead of print]Ellagic acid, sulforaphane, and ursolic acid in the prevention and therapy ofbreast cancer: current evidence and future perspectives.Jaman MS(1), Sayeed MA(2).Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rajshahi,Rajshahi, 6205, Bangladesh. sadik09bio.ru19@gmail.com.(2)Department of Clinical and Molecular Sciences, Polytechnic University ofMarche, 60126, Ancona, Italy.Globally, breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause ofcancer-related death among women. Surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, andradiotherapy are currently available treatment options for breast cancer therapy.However, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiotherapy are often associatedwith side effects and multidrug resistance, recurrence, and lack of treatment in metastasis are the major problems in the treatment of breast cancer. Recently,dietary phytochemicals have emerged as advantageous agents for the prevention andtherapy of cancer due to their safe nature. Ellagic acid (EA), sulforaphane (SF),and ursolic acid (UA), which are found in widely consumed fruits and vegetables, have been shown to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation andÂ to induceapoptosis. This review encompasses the role of EA, SF, and UA in the fightagainst breast cancer. Both in vitro and in vivo effects of these agents arepresented.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0866-4 PMID: 29725861
