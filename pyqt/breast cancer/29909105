However, themeasurement variability of left ventricular ejection fraction necessitates broad diagnostic ranges, with the consequence of low sensitivity for CTRCD.Observational data have shown GLS to be a robust and sensitive marker to predict CTRCD and thereby guide the initiation of cardioprotective therapy, but thesedata are insufficient to justify changing the diagnostic criteria for CTRCD.METHODS: The SUCCOUR (Strain sUrveillance of Chemotherapy for improvingCardiovascular Outcomes) trial is an international multicenter prospectiverandomized controlled trial. Patients who are taking cardiotoxic chemotherapy(n = 320) with at least 1 risk factor will be randomly allocated into GLS- andejection fraction-guided strategies. All participants will be followed over 3years for the primary endpoint (change in 3-dimensional ejection fraction) andother secondary endpoints.RESULTS: Among the first 185 patients (age 54 ± 13 years; 93% women) from 23international sites, 88% had breast cancer, 9% had lymphoma, and 3% had othercancers. Heart failure risk factors were prevalent: 34% had hypertension and 10% had diabetes mellitus. The most common chemotherapy regimen during this study wasthe combination of anthracycline and trastuzumab. The baseline 3-dimensional leftventricular ejection fraction was 61 ± 4%, and GLS was 20.3 ± 2.5%. Of 93patients followed up in the first year of the study, 10 had to withdraw fornoncardiac reasons. Of 40 patients randomized to the GLS-guided arm, 15 have beenstarted on cardioprotective therapy, whereas 4 of 46 patients in the ejectionfraction-guided arm have been started on therapy.CONCLUSIONS: The SUCCOUR trial will be the first randomized controlled trial ofGLS and will provide evidence to inform guidelines regarding the place of GLS forsurveillance for CTRCD.
