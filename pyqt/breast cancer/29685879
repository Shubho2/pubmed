Yet, most lesions will never progress, implying thatovertreatment exists. Therefore, we aimed to identify factors distinguishingharmless from potentially hazardous DCIS using a nested case-controlstudy.Experimental Design: We conducted a case-control study nested in apopulation-based cohort of patients with DCIS treated with breast-conservingsurgery (BCS) alone (N = 2,658) between 1989 and 2005. We compared clinical,pathologic, and IHC DCIS characteristics of 200 women who subsequently developed ipsilateral invasive breast cancer (iIBC; cases) and 474 women who did not(controls), in a matched setting. Median follow-up time was 12.0 years(interquartile range, 9.0-15.3). Conditional logistic regression models were usedto assess associations of various factors with subsequent iIBC risk after primaryDCIS.Results: High COX-2 protein expression showed the strongest association withsubsequent iIBC [OR = 2.97; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.72-5.10]. Inaddition, HER2 overexpression (OR = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.05-2.31) and presence ofperiductal fibrosis (OR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.06) were associated withsubsequent iIBC risk. Patients with HER2+/COX-2high DCIS had a 4-fold higher riskof subsequent iIBC (vs. HER2-/COX-2low DCIS), and an estimated 22.8% cumulativerisk of developing subsequent iIBC at 15 years.Conclusions: With this unbiasedstudy design and representative group of patients with DCIS treated by BCS alone,COX-2, HER2, and periductal fibrosis were revealed as promising markerspredicting progression of DCIS into iIBC. Validation will be done in independent datasets. Ultimately, this will aid individual risk stratification of women with primary DCIS.
