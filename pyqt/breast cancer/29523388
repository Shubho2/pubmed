This retrospective population-basedstudy reports treatment and outcomes for patients with phyllodes tumors andevaluates characteristics that influence outcome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were analysed on 183 patients with newly diagnosedphyllodes tumors from 1999 to 2014. Five-year Kaplan-Meier local recurrence andsurvival were compared between cohorts with benign (n=83), borderline (n=50) and malignant phyllodes tumor (n=49) histology.RESULTS: Median (range) follow-up was 65 (0.5-197) months. Local excision wasperformed in 163 and mastectomy in 19 patients. Eleven patients with malignantphyllodes tumors received radiation therapy. Overall, local recurrence occurredin 8.7%, distant metastases in 4.4%, and cause specific deaths in 3.8%. Five-yearKaplan-Meier outcomes among women with benign, borderline, and malignantphyllodes tumors were: local recurrence 6% vs 9% vs 21%, P=0.131; overallsurvival 96% vs 100% vs 82%, P=0.002; and disease-free survival 94% vs 91% vs67%, P<0.001. Five-year Kaplan-Meier local recurrence among women with negativevs close vs positive margins were 8% vs 6% vs 37%, P<0.001. Corresponding ratesfor intermediate vs pushing vs infiltrative borders were 6% vs 6% vs 33%,P=0.006. Positive margins and infiltrative tumor borders were associated withincreased local recurrence (all P≤0.006), and the latter remained significant in exploratory analyses after adjusting for margin status and phyllodes tumorclassification.CONCLUSIONS: Five-year outcomes among women with phyllodes tumors were comparableto those reported in the literature. Exploratory analysis has suggested thatinfiltrative tumor borders may be used in conjunction with margin status toassess local recurrence risk.Copyright © 2018 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO).
