Email: drbalawi@yahoo.comAim: VEGF gene polymorphisms can induce either increase or inhibition of VEGFsecretion, with altered promoter activity. The VEGF rs699947 SNP is located inthe promoter region and is associated with susceptibility to breast carcinomadevelopment. Here, we investigated the association of the -2578C>A polymorphismin the VEGF gene with breast cancer risk in Saudi women. Methodology: Genotyping of the VEGF-gene variation (-2578A>C) was performed using the amplificationrefractory mutation system PCR. We investigated the association of VEGF genevariants with different clinicopathological features of breast cancer patients.Results: A significant difference was observed in genotype distribution among thebreast cancer cases and sex matched healthy controls (p=0.03). The frequencies ofthe three genotypes CC, CA, AA found in the patient samples were 37%, 45% and 18%and in the healthy controls were 54%,37% ,and 09% respectively. An increased riskof developing breast cancer in Saudi women was associated with the VEGF −2578 AA genotype (OR = 2.91, 95 % CI, 1.18-7.20; p = 0.01; RR 1.78 (1.01-3.11 p=0.01),the VEGF −2578 A allele (OR = 1.79, 95 % CI, 1.17-2.73; p = 0.004: RR 1.351.07-1.71) and the VEGFR-(CA+ AA) (OR 1.99 1.13-3.51; RR 1.401.0-1.85). Thus the A allele increased the risk of BC when compared with C allele. When we stratifiedgroups of patients according to the status of tumor markers, stage, age andmetastasis, statistically significant associations with −2578 C/A SNP wererevealed. Conclusion: Our data showed a significant association of the VEGF-2578C>A polymorphism with BC susceptibility in Saudi women. The VEGF -2578AAhomozygote significantly increases the risk and can be useful as a predisposinggenetic marker. Further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirmour findings.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.1135 PMCID: PMC6031782PMID: 29699375
