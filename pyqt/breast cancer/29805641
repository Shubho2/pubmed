Curcumin has promising anticancer actions against TNBC, but its application is hindered bypoor bioavailability and rapid degradation in vivo. In the present study,curcumin-loaded phospholipid nanoparticles (Cur-NPs) conjugated with epidermalgrowth factor (EGF) were prepared for specific targeting of EGF receptorsoverexpressed in TNBC. NP formulation was performed by reacting EGF peptide with N-hydroxysuccinimide-PolyethyleneGlycol-1,2-Distearoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphoethanolamine (NHS-PEG10000-DSPE),followed by efficient curcumin loading through lipid film hydration. EGFconjugation did not significantly affect NP size, zeta potential or morphology.Specific targeting was confirmed by EGF receptor activation and blocking of125I-labeled NP binding by excess EGF. EGF-Cur-NP dose-dependently suppressedMDA-MB-468 TNBC cell survival (IC50, 620 nM), and completely abolished theircapacity to form colonies. The cytotoxic effects were more potent compared withthose of free curcumin or Cur-NP. In mice bearing MDA-MB-468 tumors, injectionsof 10 mg/kg EGF-Cur-NP caused a 59.1% retardation of tumor growth at 3 weekscompared with empty NP, whereas the antitumor effect of Cur-NP was weak. Theseresults indicate that EGF-conjugated NHS-PEG10000-DSPE phospholipid NPs loadedwith curcumin may be useful for treating TNBCs that overexpress the EGF receptor.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8471 PMCID: PMC5958779PMID: 29805641
