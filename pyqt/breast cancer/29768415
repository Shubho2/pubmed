The underlying Multi U-net algorithm is based on convolutional neural networks. Under the Mayo Clinic InstitutionalReview Board protocol, a prospective study of the automatic segmentation ofsuspicious breast masses was performed. The cohort consisted of 258 femalepatients who were clinically identified with suspicious breast masses andunderwent clinical US scan and breast biopsy. The computer-aided detection tooleffectively segmented the breast masses, achieving a mean Dice coefficient of0.82, a true positive fraction (TPF) of 0.84, and a false positive fraction (FPF)of 0.01. By avoiding positioning of an initial seed, the algorithm is able tosegment images in real time (13-55 ms per image), and can have potential clinicalapplications. The algorithm is at par with a conventional seeded algorithm, whichhad a mean Dice coefficient of 0.84 and performs significantly better (P< 0.0001)than the original U-net algorithm.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195816 PMCID: PMC5955504PMID: 29768415  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
