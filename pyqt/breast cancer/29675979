Wepreviously developed a senescent-cell-based vaccine, induced by radiation andveliparib, as a preventive and therapeutic tool against triple-negative breastcancer. However, the programmed death receptor-1/programmed death ligand-1(PD-1/PD-L1) pathway was found to play an important role in vaccine failure.Hence, we further developed soluble programmed death receptor-1 (sPD1)-expressingsenescent cells to overcome PD-L1/PD-1-mediated immune suppression whilevaccinating to promote dendritic cell (DC) maturity, thereby amplifying T-cellactivation. In the present study, sPD1-expressing senescent cells showed aparticularly active status characterized by growth arrest and modifiedimmunostimulatory cytokine secretion in vitro. As expected, sPD1-expressingsenescent tumor cell vaccine (STCV/sPD-1) treatment attracted more mature DC and fewer exhausted-PD1+ T cells in vivo. During the course of the vaccine studies,we observed greater safety and efficacy for STCV/sPD-1 than for controltreatments. STCV/sPD-1 pre-injections provided complete protection from 4T1 tumorchallenge in mice. Additionally, the in vivo therapeutic study of mice with s.c. 4T1 tumor showed that STCV/sPD-1 vaccination delayed tumorigenesis and suppressedtumor progression at early stages. These results showed that STCV/sPD-1effectively induced a strong antitumor immune response against cancer andsuggested that it might be a potential strategy for TNBC prevention.© 2018 The Authors.
