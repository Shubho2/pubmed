The association between body composition and risk of breastcancer is well established. We hypothesized that the effect might exist duringthe development of FBC. Our aim was to examine the relationships of total leanmass (TLM) and percent body fat (PBF) with FBC in a general female population. Intotal, 8477 female subjects aged 20 years or older were enrolled in the study at the Tri-Service General Hospital in Taiwan from 2011 to 2016. Comprehensiveexaminations including biochemical data, measurements of body composition andbreast ultrasound were performed. PBF was positively associated with the presenceof FBC (OR = 1.039, 95%CI: 1.018-1.060), and TLM showed the opposite result(OR = 0.893, 95%CI: 0.861-0.926). Condition of metabolic syndrome (MetS),diabetes (DM) and fatty liver modified the association between PBF and FBC(P < 0.001, P = 0.032 and P = 0.007, respectively). Female subjects diagnosedwith MetS, DM, and fatty liver had higher risk of developing FBC than controlsubjects (OR = 1.110, 95%CI: 1.052-1.171; OR = 1.144, 95%CI: 1.024-1.278;OR = 1.049, 95%CI: 1.019, 1.080). Those with higher PBF (for highest quartileversus lowest, OR = 2.451, 95%CI: 1.523-3.944) or lower TLM (for highest quartileversus lowest, OR = 0.279, 95%CI: 0.171-0.455) had increased risk of developingFBC. In conclusion, increased PBF and reduced TLM were likely to predict the riskof the presence of FBC in a general female population.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27546-3 PMCID: PMC6003905PMID: 29907750
