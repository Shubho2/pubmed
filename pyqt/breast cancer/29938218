We uncover,in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), genome-wide 5hmC changes related to TET1regulation. We further demonstrate that TET1 repression is associated with highexpression of immune markers and high infiltration by immune cells. We identifyin BLBC tissues an anticorrelation between TET1 expression and the majorimmunoregulator family nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). In vitro and in mice, TET1 isdown-regulated in breast cancer cells upon NF-κB activation through binding ofp65 to its consensus sequence in the TET1 promoter. We lastly show that thesefindings extend to other cancer types, including melanoma, lung, and thyroidcancers. Together, our data suggest a novel mode of regulation for TET1 in cancerand highlight a new paradigm in which the immune system can influence cancer cellepigenetics.DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aap7309 PMCID: PMC6010319PMID: 29938218
