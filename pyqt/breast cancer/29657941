Thescreening methods can play a major role to reduce the morbidity and mortalityrate due to this malignancy. We sought the basic data in this study on ourpopulation because knowing about the baseline data is apt and vital.Materials and Methods: In this study, data were collected from a questionnaire,contained baseline bio data information, and mammographic imaging of the patientscame during 7 years. Breast imaging reporting and data system (BIRADS) score,breast composition, presence of axillary lymph nodes, microcalcifications, andother incidental positive findings were determined by a radiologist and analysis was performed by SPSS package.Results: The most common indication for mammography was annual screening. Themean age of participants to the study was 55 Â± 7.9 years. The majority (80%) ofthe patients with known breast cancer (BIRADS 6) had the extremely dense breast. The most common incidental findings in mammogram studies were focal asymmetry,architectural distortion, intramammary lymph node and accessory breasts,respectively.Conclusion: The frequency distribution of BIRADS classification in our societywas clarified. It seems that the breast cancer risk is higher in women with densebreasts. Architectural distortion was also correlated to BIRADS score.DOI: 10.4103/abr.abr_161_17 PMCID: PMC5887703PMID: 29657941
