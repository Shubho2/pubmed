Estrogen receptor-positivebreast cancer patients in the training series could be classified into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different distant metastasis-free survivalvalues based on this signature (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.11; p = 7.28 × 10-8). Theprognostic ability of this signature was confirmed in validation sets 1 (HR:2.58; p = 1.54 × 10-2) and 2 (HR: 10.06; p = 6.85 × 10-3).CONCLUSION: The lncRNA signature may have possible clinical implications in theselection of high-risk patients for tamoxifen therapy.DOI: 10.2217/pgs-2018-0032 PMID: 29983093
