Overexpression of HER2 in various cancers and the availability of itsextracellular region makes it a clinically useful target for the development oftumor-antigen specific agents. In this study, we have prepared a HER2-targetedhybrid peptide as a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imagingprobe and evaluated its tumor targeting potential in subcutaneous HER2-positivebreast cancer xenograft models.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The HER2-targeted hybrid peptide was prepared bysolid-phase peptide synthesis and radiolabeled with 99mTc by the ligand exchange method. In vitro tumor cell binding properties of 99mTc-HER2 were evaluated inHER2-positive (SKBR3) and ER-positive (MCF7 and T47D) breast cancer cell lines.In vivo tumor targeting characteristics were investigated in both SKBR3(HER2-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (HER2-negative) xenografted animal models.RESULTS: A high labeling efficiency of greater than 95% was achieved when HER2peptide was radiolabeled with 99mTc by the standard ligand exchange method.99mTc-HER2 displayed a high binding affinity (Kd=49.95±14.11 nM) to HER2-positiveSKBR3 cell line whereas in the case of the ER-positive cell lines (MCF-7 andT47D), the binding affinity was found to be 2-3-fold lower than SKBR3. In vivotumor uptake in nude mice with SKBR3 tumor xenografts was 2.81±0.79% ID/g asearly as 60 min p.i. The uptake in SKBR3 tumors was always higher than the uptakein the blood and muscle, with good tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios. In contrast, low accumulation in ER-positive tumors (MCF7 and T47D) was observedcompared to HER2-positive SKBR3 tumor mice. A low to moderate (less than 5% ID/g)accumulation and retention of 99mTc-HER2 was found in most of the major organsexcluding the kidneys in both healthy and tumor-bearing mice.CONCLUSION: In view of its ability to detect HER2-positive breast cancer cells invivo, 99mTc-HER2-targeted peptide may be a promising tumor imaging probe andwarrants further investigation.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12527 PMID: 29715105  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
