China.In this study, we aimed to identify the tumor suppressive roles of zinc finger ofthe cerebellum 1 (ZIC1) in patients with malignant breast neoplasms and toexamine the association between ZIC1 and survivin expression. For this purpose,140 invasive breast cancer specimens, 1,075 RNA breast cancer samples from TheCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 6 human breast cancer cell lines and MCF-10A normalbreast epithelial cells were selected in order to compare the expression level ofZIC1 with that of survivin via immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis.Subsequently, the MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 cells with a lower ZIC1 expression weretransfected with rLV-Zic1-PGK-Puro lentivirus or rLV-ZsGreen-PGK‑Puro lentivirus in order to observe any alterations in cell proliferation and apoptosis throughMTT assay, colony formation assay, mitochondrial membrane potential assay andflow cytometric analysis, and to analyze the modulation of molecular mechanismsby western blot analysis. In addition, xenograft mouse models were constructed toexplore the role of ZIC1 in the growth of implanted tumors. The results revealed that ZIC1 negatively correlated with survivin in tumors and cells, and a higherZIC1 RNA expression indicated a better overall survival in the 1,075 TCGA RNAbreast cancer samples. In vitro, the overexpression of ZIC1 inhibited cellproliferation, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and promoted theapoptosis of the MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR3 breast cancer cells by inactivating theAkt/mTOR/P70S6K pathway, suppressing survivin expression, modulating the cellcycle, releasing cytochrome c (Cyto-c) into the cytosol and activating caspaseproteins. In vivo, an elevated ZIC1 expression suppressed the growth of implantedtumors and downregulated survivin expression in tumors. On the whole, thefindings of this study demonstrate that ZIC1 plays a tumor suppressive role inbreast cancer, by targeting surviving, significantly downregulating itsexpression.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4450 PMCID: PMC6065452PMID: 29956756
