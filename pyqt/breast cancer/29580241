Weinvestigated the role of APLF in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)linked to breast cancer invasiveness and metastasis. Here, we show that asignificant manifestation of APLF is present in tumor sections of patients withinvasive ductal carcinoma when compared to their normal adjacent tissues. APLFwas significantly induced in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells,MDAMB-231, in comparison to invasive MCF7 or normal MCF10A breast cells andsupported by studies on invasive breast carcinoma in The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA). Functionally, APLF downregulation inhibited proliferative capacity,altered cell cycle behavior, induced apoptosis and impaired DNA repair ability ofMDAMB-231 cells. Reduction in APLF level impeded invasive, migratory, tumorigenicand metastatic potential of TNBC cells with loss in expression of genesassociated with EMT while upregulation of MET-specific gene E-cadherin (CDH1).So, here we provided novel evidence for enrichment of APLF in breast tumors,which could regulate metastasis-associated EMT in invasive breast cancer. Weanticipate that APLF could be exploited as a biomarker for breast tumors andadditionally could be targeted in sensitizing cancer cells towards DNA damagingagents.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0826-9 PMCID: PMC5870250PMID: 29580241
