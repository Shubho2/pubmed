Here, we report on deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT), apromising microtubule inhibitor in phase 1, as a promising candidate tocircumvent this obstacle. DPT remarkably suppressed tumor growth in xenograftmice bearing either paclitaxel (PTX)-sensitive MCF-7/S or acquired resistanceMCF-7/Adr (MCF-7/A) cells. Also, DPT exhibited similar accumulation in bothtumors, whereas PTX displayed much a lower accumulation in the resistant tumors. In vitro, DPT exhibited a much lower resistance index (0.552) than those of PTX(754.5) or etoposide (38.94) in both MCF-7/S and MCF-7/A cells. Flow cytometryanalysis revealed that DPT (5 and 10 nM) caused arrest of the G2/M phase in thetwo cell lines, whereas PTX (up to 10 nM) had no effect on cell-cycle progressionof the MCF-7/A cells. Microtubule dynamics assays revealed that DPT destabilized microtubule assembly in a different mode. Cellular pharmacokinetic assaysindicated comparable intracellular and subcellular accumulations of DPT in thetwo cell lines but a much lower retention of PTX in the MCF-7/A cells.Additionally, transport assays revealed that DPT was not the substrate ofP-glycoprotein, breast cancer resistance protein, or MDR-associated protein 2,indicating a lower occurrence rate of MDR. DPT might be a promising microtubuleinhibitor for breast cancer therapy, especially for treatment of drug-resistanttumors.Copyright Â© 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/dmd.117.079442 PMID: 29523600
