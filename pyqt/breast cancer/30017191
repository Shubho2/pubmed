[Epub ahead of print]Novel selenylated imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines for breast cancer chemotherapy:Inhibition of cell proliferation by Akt-mediated regulation, DNA cleavage andapoptosis.Almeida GM(1), Rafique J(2), Saba S(2), Siminski T(1), Mota NSRS(1), Filho DW(3),Braga AL(2), Pedrosa RC(1), Ourique F(4).Author information: (1)Laboratório de Bioquímica Experimental (LABIOEX), Departamento de Bioquímica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianópolis, SC, Brazil.(2)Laboratório de Síntese de Substâncias de Selênio Bioativas (LabSelen),Departamento de Química, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis,88040-900, SC, Brazil.(3)Ecology and Zoology Department, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),Florianópolis, SC, Brazil.(4)Laboratório de Bioquímica Experimental (LABIOEX), Departamento de Bioquímica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianópolis, SC, Brazil.Electronic address: ouriquefabiana@gmail.com.A novel series of selenylated imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines were designed andsynthesized with a view to a promising activity against breast cancer cell. Thecompounds, 7-methyl-3-(naphthalene-1-ylselanyl)-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine,named IP-Se-05, and3-((2-methoxyphenyl)selanyl)-7-methyl-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, namedIP-Se-06, showed high cytotoxicity for MCF-7 cells (IC50 = 26.0 μM and 12.5 μM,respectively). Both the compounds inhibited the cell proliferation and causeddecrease in the number of cells in the G2/M phase of cell cycle. IP-Se-05 andIP-Se-06 were also evaluated for effects on CT-DNA and DNA of MCF-7 cells. Thecompounds intercalated into CT-DNA and both treatments caused cleavage of DNA in cells. In addition, the compounds induced cell death by apoptosis. However, thepresence of (2-methoxyphenyl) selenyl moiety at the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine(IP-Se-06) appears to have a better antitumor effect with higher cytotoxicity at a lower concentration and caused less necrosis. Overall, the current studyestablished IP-Se-06 more than IP-Se-05 as a potential prototype compound to beemployed as an antiproliferative agent for the treatment of breast cancer.Copyright © 2018.
