Chan School of Public Health, Boston,MA, USA.We evaluated the relation of fruit and vegetable consumption, including specific fruits and vegetables, with incident breast cancer characterized by menopausalstatus, hormone receptor status, and molecular subtypes. Fruit and vegetableconsumption, cumulatively averaged across repeated, validated questionnaires, wasexamined in relation to risk of invasive breast cancer among 182,145 womeninitially aged 27-59y in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, 1980-2012) and NHSII(1991-2013). Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for known riskfactors, was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals(CIs), and assessed tumors by hormone receptor status and molecular subtypes. We prospectively documented 10,911 invasive breast cancer cases. Greater intake oftotal fruits and vegetables, especially cruciferous and yellow/orange vegetables,was associated with significantly lower breast cancer risk (>5.5 versus ≤2.5servings/day HR=0.89, 95%CI=0.83-0.96; Ptrend =0.005). Intake of total vegetableswas especially associated with lower risk of estrogen receptor negative tumors(HR per 2 additional servings/day as a continuous variable=0.85, 95%CI=0.77-0.93;Pheterogeneity =0.02). Among molecular subtypes, higher intake of total fruitsand vegetables (HR per 2 additional servings/day as a continuous variable) wasmost strongly associated with lower risk of human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 (HER2)-enriched (HR=0.78, 95%CI=0.66-0.92), basal-like (HR=0.85,95%CI=0.73-0.99), and luminal A (HR=0.94, 95%CI=0.89-0.99), but not with luminal B tumors (Pheterogeneity =0.03). In conclusion, our findings support that higher intake of fruits and vegetables, and specifically cruciferous and yellow/orangevegetables, may reduce the risk of breast cancer, especially those that are more likely to be aggressive tumors.
