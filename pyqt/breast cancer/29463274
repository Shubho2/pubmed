However, its function in tumor growth and metastasis in NPC has rarelybeen reported. In this study, we investigated the functional and molecularmechanisms by which CLCA2 influences NPC.METHODS: CLCA2 expression in human NPC cell lines and tissues was examined viareal-time PCR (RT-PCR), Western blot and IHC. The biological roles of CLCA2 inproliferative, migration and invasion of NPC cell lines was evaluated in 5-8F,S18, S26 and SUNE-1 cells. Cell viability, migration and invasion were assessedin vitro by MTS, colony formation and transwell assay, respectively. CLCA2 ingrowth and metastasis of NPC were evaluated in vivo through NPC xenograft tumorgrowth, lung metastatic mice model and popliteal lymph node (LN) metastasismodel.RESULTS: Overexpression of CLCA2 significantly decreased proliferation, migrationand invasion of NPC cells. In contrast, knockdown of CLCA2 elicited the opposite effects. CLCA2 overexpression suppressed xenograft tumor growth and lung,popliteal lymph node (LN) metastasis in vivo. CLCA2 inhibited tumor metastasisthrough suppressing epithelial-Mesenchymal transition (EMT) and in-activatingFAK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in NPC cells. Immunohistochemical staining of 143NPC samples revealed that CLCA2 expression was an independent, favorableprognostic factor for overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival ofpatients. In addition, inhibition of FAK and ERK1/2 reversed CLCA2silencing-induced tumor cell migration. Furthermore, inhibitors against chloride channels suppressed NPC cellular migration which could have been enhanced by the presence of CLCA2.CONCLUSION: CLCA2 suppress NPC proliferation, migration, invasion andepithelial-mesenchymal transition through inhibiting FAK/ERK signaling.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0692-8 PMCID: PMC5819171PMID: 29463274
