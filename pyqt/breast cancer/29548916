Electronic address: nehal.attaf@science.tanta.edu.eg.Norfloxacin (NOR), a well-known antibacterial agent is also known to havepotential antitumor activity. In this study, NOR was immobilized intopoly(3-hydroxybutyrate/polyethylene glycol‑nickel oxide (PHB/PEG-NiO)nanocomposites using different NiO contents. The NiO nanoparticles were prepared by sol-gel method and the nanocomposites were prepared by solution cast films.Physicochemical features of nanocomposites were monitored by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM and TGA. PHB/PEG-5%NiO nanocomposites showed high NOR loading efficiency (60%)and a long-sustained release in comparison with other carriers. The studies onthe adsorption of NOR onto PHB/PEG-NiO nanocomposite revealed that the adsorptionprocess obeyed second order kinetic and Temkin isotherm was applicable todescribe the adsorption process. The mechanism of release was studied by usingdifferent kinetic equations. The loaded nanocomposites (NOR@PHB/PEG-NiO) showedeffective antimicrobial activity towards gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus),and gram-negative bacteria (E.coli and Klebsiella pneumonia). The in vitrocytotoxicity was conducted on four human cancer cell lines viz., liverHepatocellular carcinoma, colon cancer cell, prostate cancer cell, and breastadenocarcinoma from human and one normal human amnion cell line using MTT assay. Cytotoxicity results demonstrated that NOR@PHB/PEG-NiO significantly reduced cellviability than free NOR. NOR@ PHB/PEG-NiO has about 2.5-fold more cytotoxicity ascompared with free drug with a lack of cytotoxicity against normal cells.Copyright © 2018.
