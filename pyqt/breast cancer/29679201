It is not routinely applied topredict neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) response; data in diverse patientpopulations also are limited. We developed a statistical model based on standard clinicopathologic features to identify high-risk cases (RS > 30) and thenevaluated ability of predicted high RS to predict for NACT downstaging.METHODS: Primary surgery patients with Oncotype DX RS testing 2012-2016 wereidentified from a prospectively-maintained database. A RS predictive model wascreated and applied to a dataset of comparable NACT patients. Response wasdefined as tumor size decrease ≥ 1 cm.RESULTS: Of 394 primary surgery patients-60.4% white American; 31.0% AfricanAmerican-RS distribution was similar for both groups. No single feature reliably identified high RS patients; however, a model accounting for age, HR expression, proliferative index (MIB1/Ki67), histology, and tumor size was generated, withreceiver operator area under the curve 0.909. Fifty-six NACT patients wereidentified (25 African American). Of 21 cases with all relevant clinicopathology,14 responded to NACT and the model generated high-risk RS in 14 (100%);conversely, of 16 cases generating high-risk RS, only 2 did not respond.CONCLUSIONS: Predictive modelling can identify high RS patients; this model also can identify patients likely to experience primary tumor downstaging with NACT.Until this model is validated in other datasets, we recommend thatOncotype-eligible patients undergo primary surgery with decisions regardingchemotherapy made in the adjuvant setting.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6440-7 PMID: 29679201
