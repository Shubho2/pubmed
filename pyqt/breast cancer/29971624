The mean agewas 35 years, mostly women in their reproductive age. In our study, patients withGM were more likely to be Hispanic compared to the general population.Sixty-three percent of patients were within 5 years of previous pregnancy.Painful palpable mass-like lesion was the most common physical finding. Breastultrasound (US) was performed in all patients, and most commonly showed ahypoechoic irregular-shaped mass. Mammography (MG) showed asymmetry or irregular mass as the main finding. Definitive diagnosis was obtained by imaging-guidedcore needle biopsies in 94.4%. Conservative management was preferred, and onlyone patient underwent surgery.CONCLUSION: Although clinical and radiological findings of patients with GM maymimic those of breast carcinoma, our study showed that women of childbearing age,especially among Hispanic ethnicity with a recent history of pregnancy or highprolactin level and newly tender mass-like lesion, in addition to new focalasymmetry on mammogram and heterogeneous hypoechoic irregular-shaped mass onultrasound exam, should raise concern for GM. Non-invasive approach and clinical follow-up were the preferred treatment method.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4870-3 PMID: 29971624
