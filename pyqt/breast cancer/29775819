Electronic address: zhaogangteng@163.com.In the work, yolk-shell structured mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (YSMONs)are successfully prepared by a mild alkalescent etching approach. The method isvery convenient, in which mesostructured organosilica nanospheres are directlytransformed into yolk-shell structures after etching with mild alkalescentsolution (e.g. sodium carbonate solution). The prepared YSMONs haveethane-bridged frameworks, a monodisperse diameter (320 nm), a large pore volume (1.0 cm3 g-1), a uniform mesopore (2.4 nm) and a high surface area (1327 m2 g-1).In vitro cytotoxicity and hemolysis assays demonstrate the ethane-bridged YSMONs possess excellent biocompatibility and low hemolysis activity. In addition, theYSMONs show a high loading capacity up to 181 μg mg-1 for anti-cancer drugdoxorubicin (DOX). Confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry analysesshow that the DOX loaded YSMONs (YSMONs-DOX) can be effiectively internalized by multidurg resistant MCF-7/MDR human breast cancer cells. The chemotherapy againstMCF-7/MDR cells demonstrate that the YSMONs-DOX possess higher therapeuticefficacy compared to that of free DOX, suggesting that the YSMONs synthesized by the mild alkalescent etching method have great promise as advanced nanoplatforms for biological applications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
