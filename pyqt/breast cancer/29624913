The introduction of anti-CD20 antibodyrituximab for the treatment of B-cell NHLs has significantly improved theclinical outcome of these malignant diseases. It is unclear, however, whetherconsolidative RT could still add therapeutic benefits for PB-DLBCL patientstreated with rituximab. To answer this important question, we used theSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to evaluate theimpact of RT on the clinical outcomes of PB-DLBCL patients in the rituximab era. Information on patient age, year of diagnosis, stage, race, laterality, and RTstatus for PB-DLBCL patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2014 were extracted.Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted, and log-rank test was used to compare the potential survival difference. Multivariate analysis using Cox proportionalhazards model was employed to determine the impact of RT and other factors suchas age, race, tumor laterality, stage, and year of diagnosis on survival. Amongthe 386 patients identified, the median follow-up time was 45 months (range,0-167 months); the median age was 64 years (range, 19-93 years); 33.9% of thepatients were younger than 60 years of age; 69.9% of the patients were stage I;79.0% were white; 51.8% received RT. The 5-year OS and cause-specific survival(CSS) for the whole cohort were 72.3% and 82.5%, respectively. The 5-year OS was significantly superior for patients who received RT compared to those who did notreceive RT (78.1% vs. 66.0%, P = 0.031). In multivariable analysis, RT remainedsignificantly associated with improved OS (P = 0.026). In summary, our studysuggests that RT still adds significant therapeutic benefits for patients withPB-DLCBL in the rituximab era.© 2018 The Authors.
