Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) aremajor innate immune cells in tumor microenvironment that regulate intratumoralimmunity and angiogenesis by secretion of cytokines, growth factors as well aschitinase-like proteins (CLPs), that combine properties of cytokines and growthfactors. YKL-39 is a chitinase-like protein found in human and absent in rodents,and its expression in TAMs and role in breast cancer progression was not studied to date. Here for the first time we demonstrate that YKL-39 is expressed on TAMs,predominantly positive for stabilin-1, but not by malignant cells or otherstromal cells in human breast cancer. TGF-beta in combination with IL-4, but not IL-4 alone was responsible of the stimulation of the production of YKL-39 inhuman primary macrophages. Mechanistically, stabilin-1 directly interacted withYKL-39 and acted as sorting receptor for targeting YKL-39 into the secretorypathway. Functionally, purified YKL-39 acted as a strong chemotactic factor forprimary human monocytes, and induced angiogenesis in vitro. Elevated levels ofYKL-39 expression in tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were predictive for increased risk of distant metastasis and for poor response to NAC in patientswith nonspecific invasive breast carcinoma. Our findings suggest YKL-39 as anovel therapeutic target, and blocking of its activity can be combined with NACin order to reduce the risk of metastasis in breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1436922 PMCID: PMC5980380PMID: 29872578
