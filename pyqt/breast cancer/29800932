We aimed toevaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of dose-dense anthracycline &cyclophosphamide (ddAC) followed by weekly paclitaxel (wT) in combination withweekly Cb.METHODS: Retrospective data was collected on patients with clinical stage I-IIITNBC treated with neoadjuvant ddAC-wTCb (four cycles of ddA 60 mg/m2 and ddC600 mg/m2 every 2 weeks followed by 12 cycles of wT 80 mg/m2 with Cb AUC 1.5).Indices of tolerability and pCR were evaluated and compared to a historicalcohort (n = 76) treated with ddAC-T. A secondary objective was to evaluate therates of pCR by BRCA status.RESULTS: For 43 eligible patients, mean age was 41.5 years, 51% had clinicalstage II disease, 81.4% were clinically node positive and 32.6% carried adeleterious BRCA1 mutation. Only 35% completed all scheduled doses ofchemotherapy. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was observed in 42.5% of patients. OverallpCR was 51.2%; 44.8% in BRCA wild-type compared to 64.3% in BRCA-associated TNBC (p = 0.232). pCR rates with ddAC-wTCb were similar to historic institutionalrates with ddAC-T (51.2% vs. 51.3%, p = 0.987) and were comparable whenstratified by BRCA status. In pooled multivariate analysis, only BRCA status (HR 4.00, 95%CI 1.65-9.75, p = 0.002) was significantly associated with pCR.CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant ddAC-wTCb is less tolerable in clinical practice comparedto most clinical trials, with a pCR comparable to historic rates usingnon-platinum regimen. The role of Cb in neoadjuvant chemotherapy for BRCA mutatedTNBC remains uncertain.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.breast.2018.05.007 PMID: 29800932
