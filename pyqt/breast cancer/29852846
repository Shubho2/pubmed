Crit Care Resusc. 2018 Jun;20(2):85-93.The search for biomarkers in the critically ill: a cautionary tale.Moran JL(1), Solomon PJ(2).Author information: (1)Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woodville,SA, Australia. john.moran@adelaide.edu.au.(2)School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA,Australia.The search for biomarkers has been described as a dismal patchwork of fragmented research. We review biomarkers in sepsis in the critically ill in terms ofconventional single circulating proteins. Despite sepsis biomarker publicationstrebling over the past 6 years, currently only one, procalcitonin, hasmaterialised promise. We survey genomic biomarker initiatives, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene signatures. Despite many SNP associations withsepsis susceptibility and a limited number of genome-wide association studies,the status of these associations is that of genomic signposts only. The standing of gene signatures in the paradigmatic discipline, breast cancer, is described.Uncertainties in the understanding of the sepsis process are documented - thedissociation between blood and tissue element activity, or compartmentalisation. The paradox of the active search for gene signatures to refine the sepsisphenotype and discover target subtypes for new therapies in the absence of suchtherapies is presented.PMID: 29852846
