This work examines the effects of lysinedemethylase 4C (KDM4C) knockdown on the behavior of a triple-negative breastcancer cell line. KDM4C expression was knocked-down by siRNA and analyzed byWestern blot and immunofluorescence. HCC38 cell proliferation was examined by MTTassay, while breast cancer cells' migration and invasion were tested in Transwellformat by chemotaxis. Immunofluorescence assays showed that KDM4C, which is a keyprotein for modulating histone demethylation and chromosome stability through thedistribution of genetic information, is located at the chromosomes duringmitosis. Proliferation assays demonstrated that KDM4C is important for cellsurvival, while Transwell migration and invasion assays indicated that thisprotein is relevant for cancer progression. These data indicate that KDM4C isrelevant for breast cancer progression and highlight its importance as apotential therapeutic target.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418773075 PMCID: PMC6073829PMID: 30083054
