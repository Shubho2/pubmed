Epub 2018 Apr 19.Comparison of epidemiological features, clinicopathological features, andtreatments between premenopausal and postmenopausal female breast cancer patientsin western China: a retrospective multicenter study of 15,389 female patients.Feng F(1), Wei Y(1), Zheng K(1), Li Y(2), Zhang L(1), Wang T(1), Zhang Y(1), LiH(1), Ren G(1), Li F(1).Author information: (1)Department of Thyroid and Breast Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital ofChongQing Medical University, Friendship Road, Yu-Zhong District, ChongQing,400016, China.(2)Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of ChongQing MedicalUniversity, Friendship Road, Yu-Zhong District, ChongQing, 400016, China.Premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancers are considered different types.Thus, this study aimed to explore differences in risk factors, epidemiologicalfeatures, clinicopathological features, and treatment modes of premenopausalbreast cancer compared to postmenopausal patients in western China. This was ahospital-based, retrospective, multicenter epidemiological study of patients withbreast cancer. Using the Western China Clinical Cooperation Group database, weobtained the records of 15,389 female breast cancers between January 2010 andApril 2017. These patients were divided into premenopausal and postmenopausalgroups, and their risk factors, epidemiological feature, clinicopathologicalfeatures, and treatment modes were compared. Chi-square tests, t-test, and themultivariate logistic regression analysis were applied for statistical analysis. A total of 8395 patients were categorized as premenopausal, and 6994 patientswere categorized as postmenopausal. Their risk factors, epidemiological features,clinicopathological features, and treatment modes were compared. Premenopausalpatients with breast cancer had a greater tumor diameter at diagnosis(P = 0.008); higher rates of estrogen receptor (ER) expression (P < 0.0001),progesterone receptor (PR) expression (P < 0.0001), negative human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression (P = 0.015), and negative P53expression (P < 0.0001); and higher proportions of receiving breast-conservingsurgery and breast reconstruction (P < 0.0001), chemotherapy (P < 0.0001),radiotherapy (P < 0.0001), and endocrine therapy (P < 0.0001). The ethnicity, ageat menarche, marital status, number of pregnancies, and number of births were therisk factors for age at diagnosis of breast cancer before or after menopause inwestern China. We found that the fall in the fertility rate, early menarche age, married, and less breastfeeding might have increased the possibility ofpremenopausal breast cancer. Significant differences exist in the tumor size,hormone receptor state, HER2 expression, epidemiological features, and treatment modes between premenopausal and postmenopausal female breast cancer patients inwestern China. Its further implementation requires prospective clinical testing.© 2018 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/cam4.1503 PMCID: PMC6010855PMID: 29673111
