However, itsmetabolism remains unknown. This study was carried out to investigate the invitro and in vivo metabolism of neratinib using an UHPLC-DAD-Q ExactiveOrbitrap-MS instrument with dd-MS2 on-line data acquisition mode. Thepost-acquisition data was processed using MetWorks software. Under the currentconditions, a total of 12 metabolites were detected and structurally identifiedbased on their accurate masses, fragment ions and chromatographic retentiontimes. Among these metabolites, M3, M10 and M12 were unambiguously identifiedusing chemically synthesized reference standards. M6 and M7 (GSH conjugates) werethe major metabolites. The metabolic pathways of neratinib were proposedaccordingly. Our findings suggested that neratinib was mainly metabolized viaO-dealkylation (M3), oxygenation (M8), N-demethylation (M10), N-oxygenation(M12), GSH conjugation (M1, M2, M4, M5, M6 and M7) and N-acetylcysteineconjugation (M9 and M11). The α,β-unsaturated ketone was the major metabolic siteand GSH conjugation was the predominant metabolic pathway. In conclusion, thisstudy provided valuable metabolic data and would benefit the assessment of thecontributions to the overall activity or toxicity from the key metabolites.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/bmc.4272 PMID: 29726026
