At present, there are no approved therapeuticmodalities that target hypomethylation. In this regard, we examined thetherapeutic plausibility of using universal methyl group donorS-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to block breast cancer development, growth, andmetastasis through a series of studies in vitro using two different human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T) and in vivo using an MDA-MB-231xenograft model of breast cancer. We found that SAM treatment caused asignificant dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation, invasion, migration,anchorage-independent growth and increased apoptosis in vitro. These results wererecapitulated in vivo where oral administration of SAM reduced tumor volume andmetastasis in green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. Gene expression analyses validated the ability of SAM to decrease the expression of several key genes implicated in cancer progression and metastasis in both celllines and breast tumor xenografts. SAM was found to be bioavailable in the serum of experimental animals as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nonotable adverse side effects were seen including any change in animal behavior.The results of this study provide compelling evidence to evaluate the therapeuticpotential of methylating agents like SAM in patients with breast cancer to reducecancer-associated morbidity and mortality.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23704 PMCID: PMC5797041PMID: 29435170
