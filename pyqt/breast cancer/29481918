Electronic address: amsgs@yahoo.com.BACKGROUND: The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety, technicalfeasibility, and complications of totally implanted venous access ports (TIVAPs) in the upper arm, for comparison with transjugular chest ports in patients withbreast cancer.METHODS: In total, 223 consecutive female breast cancer patients who received aTIVAP in the upper arm or chest between July 2014 and February 2016 wereincluded. All procedures were performed via a sonographic and fluoroscopic-guidedapproach using the Seldinger technique under local anesthesia. We reviewed themedical records to determine technical success, pain scale, and early (≤30 days) and late (>30 days) complications.RESULTS: In total, 231 devices were implanted in the upper arms (n = 176, 76%)and chests (n = 55, 24%) of the patients. The mean age was 51.6 ± 10.7 years(range 23-78 years; upper arm, 52.1 ± 11.0 years; chest, 50.1 ± 9.7 years,P > 0.05). The mean implantation time for TIVAPs was 181.7 ± 109.2 days (range,9-460 days; upper arm 175.2 ± 102.7 days; chest, 202.4 ± 126.6 days, P > 0.05),with 41,974 catheter days. The technical success rate was 100%. Fourteencomplications (6.1%) occurred in 14 patients (0.33/1,000 catheter days). Therewas no significant difference in complication-free survival for patients withupper arm TIVAPs and those with transjugular chest TIVAPs. The mean amount of 2% lidocaine, used as local anesthesia, was 3.3 ± 1.7 mL and 14.5 ± 4.1 mL for upperarm and chest TIVAPs, respectively. (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of TIVAPs in the upper arm is a safe procedure with alow rate of complications. Upper arm TIVAPs can be implanted with less paincompared with transjugular chest TIVAPs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.avsg.2017.11.059 PMID: 29481918
