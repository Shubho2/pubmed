We present the case of a 39-year-old female patient withmetastatic breast cancer who experienced GIRR myositis 3 months followingpostoperative radiotherapy, with additional potential paraspinal myositisfollowing ablative radiotherapy to the thoracic spine. A review of previouslypublished cases of GIRR myositis was performed. The case and literature reviewdescribe the clinical course and presentation of GIRR, and highlight theimportance of including radiation recall as part of a differential diagnosis whena patient undergoing chemotherapy experiences an inflammatory reaction at a priorsite of radiation.DOI: 10.1159/000487478 PMCID: PMC5903158PMID: 29681817
