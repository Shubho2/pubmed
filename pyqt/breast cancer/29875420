Data was abstracted from medical records. Using multivariate logistic regressions, predictors of testing uptake were analyzed.RESULTS: The overall uptake of testing was 67% (539 of 805 patients). Low uptake rates were found for patients aged ≥80 years (33%), and patients born outside of Europe (37%). In adjusted analysis, age ≥80 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.10;P = 0.002), psychiatric disorders (OR 0.46; P = 0.006), occupation requiring atleast 3 years of university or college education (OR 2.03; P = 0.003), and breastcancer or ovarian cancer in first-degree or second-degree relatives (OR 1.66;P = 0.02) were independently associated with uptake of BRCA1/2 testing. Somaticcomorbidity in patients aged <70 years was associated with lower testing uptake.CONCLUSION: Testing uptake varies across different subgroups according topatient-related factors that are readily available in the medical records.Knowledge about these factors enables health care professionals to identifypatients who are less likely to pursue genetic testing.DOI: 10.1038/s41436-018-0021-9 PMID: 29875420
