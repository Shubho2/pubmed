During bone metastasis, metastatic tumor cells must rewire their biology and express genes that are normally expressed by bone cells (aprocess called osteomimicry), which endow tumor cells with full competence foroutgrowth in the bone marrow. Here we establish miR-30 family members miR-30a,miR-30b, miR-30c, miR-30d and miR-30e as suppressors of breast cancer bonemetastasis that regulate multiple pathways, including osteomimicry. Lowexpression of miR-30 in primary tumors from breast cancer patients wereassociated with poor relapse-free survival. Additionally, estrogen receptor(ER)-negative/progesterone receptor (PR)-negative breast cancer cells expressedlower miR-30 levels than their ER/PR-positive counterparts. Overexpression ofmiR-30 in ER/PR-negative breast cancer cells resulted in the reduction of bonemetastasis burden in vivo. In vitro, miR-30 did not affect tumor cellproliferation, but did inhibit tumor cell invasion. Furthermore, overexpressionof miR-30 restored bone homeostasis by reversing the effects of tumorcell-conditioned medium on osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. A number ofgenes associated with osteoclastogenesis stimulation (IL-8, IL-11),osteoblastogenesis inhibition (DKK-1), tumor cell osteomimicry (RUNX2, CDH11),and invasiveness (CTGF, ITGA5, ITGB3) were identified as targets for repressionby miR-30. Among these genes, silencing CDH11 or ITGA5 in ER-/PR-negative breast cancer cells recapitulated inhibitory effects of miR-30 on skeletal tumor burden in vivo. Overall, our findings provide evidence that miR-30 family members employmultiple mechanisms to impede breast cancer bone metastasis and may representattractive targets for therapeutic intervention.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-3058 PMID: 30042152
