Search terms included cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK, breast cancer,palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib, PD0332991, LEE011, and LY2835219.Clinicaltrials.gov was also searched.STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Trials with clinical efficacy outcomesevaluating CDK 4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of advanced hormone-positivebreast cancer were considered.DATA SYNTHESIS: Palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib each demonstratedsignificant benefit when combined with an aromatase inhibitor, the benefit topatients was similar for each, with an improvement of 42% to 51% in medianprogression-free survival (PFS). In combination with fulvestrant, CDK 4/6inhibitors used for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive ABC resulted in a 43% to 58% improvement in median PFS versus fulvestrant alone. CDK inhibitors arerelatively well tolerated; however, discontinuation as a result of adverseeffects was highest with abemaciclib. Relevance to Patient Care and ClinicalPractice: This review considers the use of the 3 commercially available CDK 4/6inhibitors for treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, includingdata on each of the 3 agents in newly advanced and treatment refractory disease.CONCLUSIONS: The CDK inhibitors should be used in combination with endocrinetherapies for the treatment of ABC. Efficacy of the 3 agents is similar.Selection within the class should include consideration of adverse effects anddrug interactions.DOI: 10.1177/1060028018793656 PMID: 30079740
