The secondary aim was to investigate if patient ageinfluenced DIBH amplitude.METHOD: A retrospective study of 30 patients with left-sided breast cancer wascompleted. Patients were randomly selected from the total number of patients dualscanned in free breathing (FB) and DIBH over a 2-year period. Plans wereretrospectively virtually simulated and statistical analysis performed.RESULTS: All patients achieved decreased V30 and mean cardiac dose using DIBH. A positive correlation was found between DIBH amplitude and cardiac V30 dosereduction (p = 0.007, R = 0.48). Ratio of amplitude increase from FB to DIBH and cardiac V30 reduction was positively correlated and statistically significant(p = 0.04, R = 0.38); Ratio of amplitude increase of at least 15 times FBachieved 100% V30 dose reduction, however this was also achieved with ratioincrease as low as 6.25 times FB. A statistically significant positivecorrelation was identified between DIBH amplitude and mean cardiac dose reduction(p = 0.003, R = 0.523). No correlation was found between patient age andamplitude ratio increase (p = 0.602, R = -0.099).CONCLUSION: A 100% reduction in cardiac V30 can be achieved with a DIBH amplitudeincrease of 15 times FB. A full reduction can also be achieved at much lowerlevels (6.25 times FB in current study); however there appears to be nopre-determining patient factors to identify this. DIBH amplitudes of 1 cm-4 cmreduce cardiac mean dose by at least 50%.Copyright © 2017 The College of Radiographers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
