Although thyroid cancer as a whole is generallyindolent and relatively easy to treat, some subtypes carry a higher rate ofmetastasis and cancer-related mortality. A growing number of studies have focusedon the dysregulation of miRNAs in TC. However, differences in methods makecomparison of gene profiling data difficult. A meta-analysis of published studiescomparing miRNA expression data of invasive thyroid carcinoma with pairednon-invasive tumors or normal tissues was performed by searching the literaturefor "invasion", "thyroid cancer", and "miRNA". This revealed 29 dysregulatedmiRNAs associated with TC in 16 articles; the presence of invasion was confirmed in each respective article by laboratory research or patient follow-up. Amongthese miRNAs, miRNA-146b, miRNA-221, and miRNA-222 were analyzed further due totheir higher frequencies across multiple studies. Of these studies, 6 wereincluded in the meta-analysis, as they compared invasive PTC with paired normaltissues or non-invasive PTC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.16681 PMCID: PMC5797065PMID: 29435194
