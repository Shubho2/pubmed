Chris.Lord@icr.ac.uk.Although defects in the RB1 tumour suppressor are one of the more common driveralterations found in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), therapeutic approachesthat exploit this have not been identified. By integrating molecular profilingdata with data from multiple genetic perturbation screens, we identifiedcandidate synthetic lethal (SL) interactions associated with RB1 defects in TNBC.We refined this analysis by identifying the highly penetrant effects, reasoningthat these would be more robust in the face of molecular heterogeneity and would represent more promising therapeutic targets. A significant proportion of thehighly penetrant RB1 SL effects involved proteins closely associated with RB1function, suggesting that this might be a defining characteristic. These includednuclear pore complex components associated with the MAD2 spindle checkpointprotein, the kinase and bromodomain containing transcription factor TAF1, andmultiple components of the SCFSKP Cullin F box containing complex. Small-moleculeinhibition of SCFSKP elicited an increase in p27Kip levels, providing amechanistic rationale for RB1 SL. Transcript expression of SKP2, a SCFSKPcomponent, was elevated in RB1-defective TNBCs, suggesting that in these tumours,SKP2 activity might buffer the effects of RB1 dysfunction.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0368-z PMID: 29915391
