Our group and others have described markersuseful in isolating BCSCs just as aldehyde dehydrogenase positive (ALDH+) orCD24-CD44+. In fact, cells which simultaneously express both sets of markers havethe highest tumor initiating capacity. Although the transcriptomic profile ofcells expressing each BCSC marker alone has been reported, the profile of themost tumorigenic population expressing both sets of markers has not. Here we usedthe biomarker combination of ALDH and CD24/CD44 to sort four populations isolatedfrom triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient-derived xenografts, andperformed whole-transcriptome sequencing on each population. We systematicallycompared the profiles of the three states of BCSCs (ALDH+CD24-CD44+,ALDH+non-CD24-CD44+ and ALDH-CD24-CD44+) to that of the differentiated tumorcells (ALDH-non-CD24-CD44+). For the first time, we compared the ALDH+CD24-CD44+ BCSCs with the other two BCSC populations. In ALDH+CD24-CD44+ BCSCs, weidentified P4HA2, PTGR1 and RAB40B as potential prognostic markers, which werevirtually related to the status of BCSCs and tumor growth in TNBC cells.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0809-x PMCID: PMC5824475PMID: 29471829
