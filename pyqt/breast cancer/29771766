Hospital records were screened in order to identify newly diagnosed IPMNcases in the period from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2015. We searched forEPMs diagnosed previous to, synchronous to, or after the IPMN. The ratio of theobserved (O) number of patients with EPMs to the expected (E) was calculated.RESULTS: We identified 72 EPMs in 63 (31.8%) of 198 patients included. Amongthem, 51 (70.8%) were diagnosed previous to, 17 (23.6%) synchronous to, and 4(5.6%) after the IPMN. Most frequently diagnosed were colorectal (12 patients[6.1%]), breast (8 patients [6.8%, in females]), renal cell (8 patients [4.0%]), and prostate cancer (7 patients [8.6%, in males]). The O/E ratios for EPMs weresignificantly increased for cancer in general (3.66; 95% confidence interval[CI], 2.39-5.37), renal cell (9.62; 95% CI, 1.98-28.10), prostate (4.91; 95% CI, 1.59-11.45), and breast cancer (3.16; 95% CI, 1.03-7.37).CONCLUSIONS: We report an increased risk of EPMs in patients with IPMN,especially for renal cell, prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer.DOI: 10.1097/MPA.0000000000001072 PMID: 29771766
