Epub 2018 Mar 14.Impact of patient health literacy on surgical treatment of breast cancer.Keim-Malpass J(1), Doede A(1), Camacho F(2), Kennedy C(1), Showalter SL(3).Author information: (1)University of Virginia School of Nursing, Charlottesville, VA, USA.(2)Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia School ofMedicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.(3)Department of Surgery, University of Virginia School of Medicine,Charlottesville, VA, USA.Little is known about the role of low health literacy (LHL) among breast surgicaloncology patients. We initiated a prospective health literacy assessment todetermine the relationship between health literacy and surgical treatment. Among 512 patients, univariate analysis revealed no statistical significance in therelationship of health literacy to breast surgery type, contralateralprophylactic mastectomy, or reconstruction following mastectomy. In amultivariate analysis, women with LHL were less likely to undergo reconstruction (aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.94, P value = .006). Tailored interventions are neededto combat disparities in cancer treatment associated with LHL, with focus onreconstruction following mastectomy.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13011 PMID: 29537708
