Electronic address:jhrenmed@hust.edu.cn.Theranostic agents with perfect properties are needed urgently for thedevelopment of imaging guided photothermal therapy (PTT). In this work,Gd-integrated polypyrrole nanotheranostic agent (PPy@BSA-Gd) was successfullybuilt through selecting bovine serum albumin (BSA) as both stabilizers forpolymerization and biomimetic mineralization in "one pot". The obtainedPPy@BSA-Gd possessed high stability and excellent photothermal property. Besides,relevant cellular assays indicated that PPy@BSA-Gd had fantasticcytocompatibility which could be further internalized by cancer cells. Due totheir high longitudinal relaxivity value (r1 = 10.203 mM-1 s-1), PPy@BSA-Gd couldserve as considerable probe for T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).After tail vein injection of PPy@BSA-Gd, the MR signal of tumor section exhibiteda time-dependent increase, indicating effective tumor accumulation of PPy@BSA-Gd.Notably, when exposed to 808 nm laser, the tumor growth of PPy@BSA-Gd treatedmice could be inhibited by photothermal ablation successfully. All the resultsdemonstrated the well-designed PPy@BSA-Gd have the potential for tumor diagnoseand photothermal therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
