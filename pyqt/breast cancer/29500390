The aim of this work was to develop a pharmacological tool for the release of metformin in proximity of the tumor, allowing high localconcentrations, and to demonstrate the in vivo antitumor efficacy after aprolonged metformin exposition. A 1.2% w/w metformin thermoresponsive parenteral formulation based on poloxamers P407 and P124, injectable at room temperature andundergoing a sol-gel transition at body temperature, has been developed andoptimized for rheological, thermal and release control properties; theformulation is easily scalable, and proved to be stable during a 1-month storage at 5 °C. Using NOD/SCID mice pseudo-orthotopically grafted with MDA-MB-231/luc+human breast cancer cells, we report that multiple administrations of 100 mg ofthe optimized metformin formulation close to the tumor site cause tissueaccumulation of the drug at levels significantly higher than those observed inplasma, and enough to exert antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities. Ourresults demonstrate that this formulation is endowed with good stability,tolerability, thermal and rheological properties, representing a novel tool to bepursued in further investigations for adjuvant cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22054-w PMCID: PMC5834504PMID: 29500390
