To enable the in-depthanalysis of protein interactions in chromatin-associated protein complexes, wehave previously developed a method termed RIME (Rapid Immunoprecipitation Massspectrometry of Endogenous proteins). Here, we present a quantitative multiplexedmethod (qPLEX-RIME), which integrates RIME with isobaric labelling and tribridmass spectrometry for the study of protein interactome dynamics in a quantitativefashion with increased sensitivity. Using the qPLEX-RIME method, we delineate thetemporal changes of the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) interactome in breastcancer cells treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Furthermore, we identify endogenousERα-associated proteins in human Patient-Derived Xenograft tumours and in primaryhuman breast cancer clinical tissue. Our results demonstrate that the combinationof RIME with isobaric labelling offers a powerful tool for the in-depth andquantitative characterisation of protein interactome dynamics, which isapplicable to clinical samples.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04619-5 PMCID: PMC5998130PMID: 29899353
