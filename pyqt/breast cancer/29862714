We extracted a total of 428 features, consisting of morphologic features from B-mode, and intensity features and gray-levelco-occurrence matrix features from the dual modalities, and the optimal subsut offeatures was selected through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator(Lasso) under the condition of leave-one-out cross validation. We used SVM forthe classification of benign and metastatic nodes.RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Youden's index of the 35radiomics features selected with Lasso were 86.96%, 85.51%, 86.34% and 72.46%,respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The radiomics features from dual-modal ultrasound (elastography and B-mode) have demonstrated good performance for classification and have potential to be applied to clinical diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis.DOI: 10.3969/j.issn.1671-7104.2017.05.001 PMID: 29862714
