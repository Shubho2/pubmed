Epub 2018 Mar 7.Implementation of an Integrative Oncological Concept in the Daily Care of aGerman Certified Breast Cancer Center.Schad F(1), Thronicke A, Merkle A, Steele ML, Kröz M, Herbstreit C, Matthes H.Author information: (1)Research Institute Havelhöhe, Berlin, Germany.BACKGROUND: In recent decades the concept of integrative medicine has attractedgrowing interest in patients and professionals. At the GemeinschaftskrankenhausHavelhöhe (GKH), a hospital specialized in anthroposophical medicine, a breastcancer center (BCC) has been successfully certified for more than 5 years. Theobjective of the present study was to analyze how integrative strategies wereimplemented in the daily care of primary breast cancer patients.METHODS: Clinical, demographic, and follow-up data as well as information onnon-pharmacological interventions were analyzed. In addition, BCC qualitymeasures were compared with data of the National Breast Cancer BenchmarkingReport 2016.RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2016, 741 primary breast cancer patients (median age57.4 years) were treated at the GKH BCC. 91.5% of the patients showed Union forInternational Cancer Control (UICC) stage 0, I, II, or III and 8.2% were in UICC stage IV. 97% of the patients underwent surgery, 53% radiation, 38% had hormonetherapy, and 25% received cytostatic drugs. 96% of the patients receivednon-pharmacological interventions and 32% received Viscum album L.THERAPY: Follow-up was performed in up to 93% of the patients 2 years after firstdiagnosis. Compared to nationwide benchmarking BCCs, the GKH BCC met therequirements in central items.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that integrative therapiesoffered by the concept of anthroposophical medicine can be implemented in thedaily care and treatment of a certified BCC. However, as national guidelines onintegrative concepts in oncology are missing, further studies are needed for asystematic evaluation of integrative treatment and care concepts in this field.© 2018 The Author(s).
