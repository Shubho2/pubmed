Epub 2018 Feb 2.The Role of Immune Escape and Immune Cell Infiltration in Breast Cancer.Steven A(1), Seliger B(1).Author information: (1)Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg,Halle (Saale), Germany.While detailed analysis of aberrant cancer cell signaling pathways and changes incancer cell DNA has dominated the field of breast cancer biology for years, therenow exists increasing evidence that the tumor microenvironment (TME) includingtumor-infiltrating immune cells support the growth and development of breastcancer and further facilitate invasion and metastasis formation as well assensitivity to drug therapy. Furthermore, breast cancer cells have developeddifferent strategies to escape surveillance from the adaptive and innate immunesystem. These include loss of expression of immunostimulatory molecules, gain of expression of immunoinhibitory molecules such as PD-L1 and HLA-G, and alteredexpression of components involved in apoptosis. Furthermore, the composition ofthe TME plays a key role in breast cancer development and treatment response. In this review we will focus on i) the different immune evasion mechanisms used bybreast cancer cells, ii) the role of immune cell infiltration in this disease,and (iii) implication for breast cancer-based immunotherapies.DOI: 10.1159/000486585 PMCID: PMC6016054 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29950962
