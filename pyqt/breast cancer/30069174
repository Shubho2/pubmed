Epub 2018May 29.The Role of Brachytherapy in the Treatment of Breast Cancer.Kauer-Dorner D(1), Berger D(1).Author information: (1)Department of Radiotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.Radiotherapy plays an important part in the management of breast cancer.Especially after breast-conserving surgery, external whole breast irradiation,occasionally with an additional local boost, is an integral part of breastconservation. Besides external radiation techniques, brachytherapy (BT) has long been among the treatment options, especially with regard to local boostapplication. With the emerging implementation of accelerated partial breastirradiation (APBI), BT in general and interstitial multi-catheter BT inparticular, are gaining an increasing role in the management of a selected group of early breast cancer patients. APBI is an approach to reduce the irradiatedarea to the former tumor bed rather than treating the whole breast tissue inpatients with a low baseline local recurrence risk. After a variety of phaseI-III clinical studies, it is clearly evident that APBI will play a role in thetreatment of this selected patient group. In this review, we focus on theclinical development and different available techniques of breast BT and provide a preview of prospects for its use.DOI: 10.1159/000489638 PMCID: PMC6062670 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 30069174
