Human neuroblastomabreakpoint family member 1 (NBPF1) was originally identified in a neuroblastoma(NB) patient. The present study is the first to evaluate the presence of NBPF1gene methylation in cfDNA in plasma of breast cancer patients.METHODS: Differentially methylated cfDNA was screened using bisulfite sequencing with a next-generation sequencer (BS-seq) among 25 breast cancer patients, 25patients with a benign breast disease and 25 healthy female volunteers. Then,five specific methylation sites in the NBPF1 gene were verified in 11 breastcancer samples, and two further sites in the NBPF1 promoter were detected in 52breast cancer patients (stages I-III), 31 patients with benign breast disease and30 healthy controls by using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Furthermore, theassociation between the methylation statuses of NBPF1 and the clinicopathologicalcharacteristics of breast cancer patients was analyzed.RESULTS: BS-seq demonstrated that the NBPF1 methylation levels in breast cancerpatients were higher than those in patients with benign breast disease andhealthy controls. The MSP results showed that the methylation rates of two sites in the NBPF1 promoter were 67.1% and 61.4% in breast cancer patients, 48.2% and59.6% in patients with benign breast disease, and 40.9% and 48.1% in healthycontrols, respectively. The methylation rates of one site were significantlydifferent among the three groups (p < .05), with the highest rate in breastcancer patients. Moreover, there was no statistically significant correlationbetween the NBPF1 promoter methylation and the major clinicopathological featuresof the patients.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that hypermethylation of the NBPF1 promoteroccurs in a significant proportion of breast tumors and that NBPF1-methylatedcfDNA may serve as a potential tumor marker for breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
