Whether or not hormone replacementtherapy (HRT) initiated after oophorectomy is associated with an increased riskof breast cancer has not been evaluated in a prospective study.Objective: To determine the association between HRT use and BRCA1-associatedbreast cancer.Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective, longitudinal cohort study ofBRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers from 80 participating centers in 17 countrieswas conducted between 1995 and 2017 with a mean follow-up of 7.6 years.Participants had sought genetic testing for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation because of a personal or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Carriers of BRCA1mutation with no personal medical history of cancer who underwent bilateraloophorectomy following enrollment were eligible for the cohort study.Exposures: A follow-up questionnaire was administered every 2 years to obtaindetailed information on HRT use. A left-truncated Cox proportional hazardanalysis was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs associated withthe initiation of HRT use postoophorectomy.Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident breast cancer.Results: A total of 872 BRCA1 mutation carriers with a mean postoophorectomyfollow-up period of 7.6 years (range, 0.4-22.1) were included in this study. Mean(SD) age of participants was 43.4 (8.5) years. Among these, 92 (10.6%) incidentbreast cancers were diagnosed. Overall, HRT use after oophorectomy was notassociated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The HR was 0.97 (95% CI,0.62-1.52; P = .89) for ever use of any type of HRT vs no use; however, theeffects of estrogen alone and combination hormonal therapy were different. After 10 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of breast cancer among women who used estrogen-alone HRT was 12% compared with 22% among women who used estrogenplus progesterone HRT (absolute difference, 10%; log rank P = .04).Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that use of estrogen afteroophorectomy does not increase the risk of breast cancer among women with a BRCA1mutation and should reassure BRCA1 mutation carriers considering preventivesurgery that HRT is safe. The possible adverse effect of progesterone-containing HRT warrants further study.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.0211 PMID: 29710224
