In the current study, we report AXL expression in HER2-positive(HER2+) breast cancers where it correlates with poor patient survival. Usingmurine models of HER2+ breast cancer, Axl, but not its ligand Gas6, was found to be essential for metastasis. We determined that AXL is required forintravasation, extravasation, and growth at the metastatic site. We found thatAXL is expressed in HER2+ cancers displaying epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition(EMT) signatures where it contributes to sustain EMT. Interfering with AXL in apatient-derived xenograft (PDX) impaired transforming growth factor β(TGF-β)-induced cell invasion. Last, pharmacological inhibition of AXLspecifically decreased the metastatic burden of mice developing HER2+ breastcancer. Our data identify AXL as a potential anti-metastatic co-therapeutictarget for the treatment of HER2+ breast cancers.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.
