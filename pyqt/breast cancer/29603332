BPTCs arecharacterised by IDH2 R172 hotspot somatic mutations or mutually exclusive TET2somatic mutations, concurrently with mutations affecting PI3K pathway-relatedgenes. We sought to characterise their histology and investigate the frequency ofIDH2 and PIK3CA mutations in an independent cohort of BPTCs, as well as inconventional solid papillary carcinomas (SPCs).METHODS AND RESULTS: Six BPTCs, not previously analysed molecularly, and 10 SPCs were reviewed centrally. Tumour DNA was extracted from microdissectedhistological sections and subjected to Sanger sequencing of the IDH2 R172 hotspotlocus and exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA. All six BPTCs were characterised by solid,papillary and follicular architecture with circumscribed, invasive tumour nodulescomposed of epithelial cells with reverse polarity. IDH2 mutations wereidentified in all six BPTCs (three R172S, two R172T and one R172G), four of whichalso harboured PIK3CA mutations (two H1047R, one Q546K and one Q546R). Bycontrast, all SPCs lacked IDH2 mutations, while one of 10 harboured a PIK3CAmutation (H1047R).CONCLUSION: We validated the presence of IDH2 R172 hotspot mutations and PIK3CAhotspot mutations in 100% and 67% BPTCs tested, respectively, and documentedabsence of IDH2 R172 mutations in SPCs. These findings confirm thegenotypical-phenotypical correlation reported previously in BPTC, whichconstitutes an entity distinct from conventional SPC.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/his.13522 PMID: 29603332
