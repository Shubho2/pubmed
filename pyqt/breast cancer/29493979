It is one of the leading causes of cancer-relateddeaths in the United States. Since 1987, lung cancer is responsible for moredeaths in women than breast cancer. It is estimated that there are 225,000 newcases of lung cancer in the United States annually and approximately 160,000 die because of lung cancer.
