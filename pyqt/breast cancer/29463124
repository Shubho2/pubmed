China.We report a simple strategy to prepare Tween 60@2β-CD self-assembly vesicles inaqueous solution as a new drug delivery carrier for cancer chemotherapy. Thespherical shape of vesicles was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy(TEM) and mean particle sizes were about 33.7 nm, as measured by dynamic lightscattering, micro-IR results indicated that the self-assembly vesicles was drivenby hydrogen bonding. Hydrophilic doxorubicin (DOX) was successfully loaded intothe self-assembly vesicles with drug loading content of 7.85% and loadingefficiency of 42%. In addition, an in vitro cytotoxicity study and cellularuptake assays demonstrated that the DOX-loaded Tween 60@2β-CD vesicles markedlyenhanced the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of DOX toward the Hela cells.Furthermore, when used to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic efficacy in micebearing the breast cell line (4T1), DOX-loaded vesicles exhibited superiorinhibition of tumor growth compared with the DOX solutions.DOI: 10.1080/10717544.2018.1440448 PMID: 29463124
