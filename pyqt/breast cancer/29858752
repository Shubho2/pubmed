PD-L1 was assessed in tumor cells (PD-L1+ tumorcells) and tumor stromal infiltrating lymphocytes (PD-L1+ TILs); CD20 was scored in tumor-infiltrating B cells. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazardmodels were used for survival analysis.RESULTS: PD-L1+ tumor cells, PD-L1+ TILs, and CD20+ TILs were found in 8%, 66%,and 62% of IBC, respectively. PD-L1+ tumor cells strongly correlated with highTILs, pathological complete response (pCR), CD20+ TILs, but marginally withbreast cancer-specific survival (BCSS, P = 0.057). PD-L1+ TILs stronglycorrelated with high TILs, CD20+ TILs, and longer disease-free survival (DFS) in all IBC and in triple-negative (TN) IBC (P < 0.035). IBC and TN IBC patients withtumors containing both CD20+ TILs and PD-L1+ TILs (CD20+TILs/PD-L1+TILs) showedlonger DFS and improved BCSS (P < 0.002) than patients lacking both, or thosewith either CD20+ TILs or PD-L1+ TILs alone. In multivariate analyses,CD20+TILs/PD-L1+TILs status was an independent prognostic factor for DFS in IBC(hazard ratio (HR): 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.77) and TN IBC (HR: 0.39 95% CI0.17-0.88), and for BCSS in IBC (HR: 0.60 95% CI 0.43-0.85) and TN IBC (HR: 0.38 95% CI 0.17-0.83).CONCLUSION: CD20+TILs/PD-L1+TILs status represents an independent favorableprognostic factor in IBC and TN IBC, suggesting a critical role for B cells inantitumor immune responses. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and B cell-activating immunotherapiesshould be explored in these settings.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4834-7 PMID: 29858752
