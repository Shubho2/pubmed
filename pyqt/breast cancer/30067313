[Epub ahead of print]The experience of persistent pain and quality of life among women followingtreatment for breast cancer: an attachment perspective.Smith MD(1), Meredith PJ(1), Chua SY(1).Author information: (1)The University of Queensland, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences,Queensland, Australia.OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to investigate associations betweenattachment and the presence of persistent pain in women following treatment forbreast cancer and to investigate the relationship between attachment, pain andquality of life (QOL) in women with persistent pain.METHODS: Women (N=335) previously diagnosed with primary non-metastatic breastcancer completed an online survey with measures of attachment, pain, QOL,demographics, and medical history. Variables were compared between women with(n=128) and without (n=207) persistent pain. For those reporting pain, regressionanalyses were conducted to investigate relationships between attachment, pain andQOL.RESULTS: Higher attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance, was related to the presence of persistent pain. Among women with persistent pain, associationsbetween attachment anxiety and avoidance and greater pain intensity were lostwhen pain catastrophizing was considered in analysis. Significant associationsbetween attachment and diminished QOL and perceived effectiveness of painmanagement were identified in multivariate analysis.CONCLUSIONS: These findings extend the available literature regardingassociations between pain and attachment insecurity. In women with pain afterbreast cancer treatment, attachment anxiety and avoidance were associated withnegative pain and QOL outcomes. Further attention regarding the use ofattachment-informed approaches in supporting women following breast cancertreatment is indicated.This article is protected by copyright.
