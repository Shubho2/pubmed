Their ability to differentiateand lose stem cell properties makes them challenging to study. Currently, thereis no simple assay that can quickly capture and trace the dynamic phenotypicchanges on the CSC surface. Here, we report rapid discrimination of breast CSCsfrom non-CSCs using a nanoparticle-fluorescent-protein based sensor. Thisnanosensor was employed to discriminate CSCs from non-CSCs, as well as CSCs that had differentiated in vitro in two breast cancer models. Importantly, the sensor platform could also discriminate CSCs from the bulk population of cells inpatient-derived xenografts of human breast cancer. Taken together, the resultsobtained demonstrate the feasibility of using the nanosensor to phenotype CSCsand monitor their fate. Furthermore, this approach provides a novel area fortherapeutic interventions against these challenging targets.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
