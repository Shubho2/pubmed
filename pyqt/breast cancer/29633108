Each lesion was examined with B-mode US, Color/Power Doppler US and elastography (Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse-ARFI). Differentquantitative parameters were recorded for each technique, including pulsatility(PI) and resistive Index (RI) for Doppler US and lesion maximum, intermediate,and minimum shear wave velocity (SWVmax, SWVinterm, and SWVmin) as well aslesion-to-fat SWV ratio for ARFI. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of each quantitativeparameter. Classification analysis was performed using the exhaustive chi-squaredautomatic interaction detection method. Results include the probability formalignancy for every descriptor combination in the classification algorithm.RESULTS: Sixty-five lesions were malignant and 59 benign. Out of all quantitativeindices, maximum SWV (SWVmax), and RI were included in the classificationalgorithm, which showed a depth of three ramifications (SWVmax ≤ or > 3.16; ifSWVmax ≤ 3.16 then RI ≤ 0.66, 0.66-0.77 or > 0.77; if RI ≤ 0.66 then SWVmax ≤ or > 2.71). The classification algorithm leads to an AUC of 0.887 (95 % CI0.818-0.937, p < 0.0001), a sensitivity of 98.46 % (95 % CI 91.7-100 %), and aspecificity of 61.02 % (95 % CI 47.4-73.5 %). By applying the proposed algorithm,a false-positive biopsy could have been avoided in 61 % of the cases.CONCLUSIONS: A simple classification algorithm incorporating two quantitative US parameters (SWVmax and RI) shows a high diagnostic performance, being able toaccurately differentiate benign from malignant breast lesions and lower thenumber of unnecessary breast biopsies in up to 60 % of all cases, avoiding anysubjective interpretation bias.DOI: 10.1007/s11307-018-1187-x PMID: 29633108
