This disease is most commonly seen in the fifth and sixth decades of life and is almost always unilateral. The diagnosis of mammaryPaget disease is generally based on clinical findings, confirmed byhistopathologic examination. Mammographic and ultrasonographic findings may benonspecific for malignancy, with 50% of cases showing negative findings. Magneticresonance imaging can be used as a diagnostic tool to detect clinically occultcancer with nonspecific findings on mammogram and ultrasonogram. In this article,we are presenting a rare case of a young woman with biopsy-proven bilateralmammary Paget disease, for which bilateral modified radical mastectomy was done, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.DOI: 10.1016/j.radcr.2018.02.018 PMCID: PMC6043634PMID: 30008979
