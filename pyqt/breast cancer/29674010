The aim of the present study was to compare these outcomesbetween EBRT, IORT full-dose (IORT-f) and IORT boost (IORT-b).METHODS: 443 consecutive patients, candidates for breast-conserving surgery, wereincluded: EBRT was performed in 220 patients (49.7%), IORT-f in 140 patients(31.6%), and IORT-b in 83 patients (18.7%). Radiotherapy-related toxicities were registered. Patients were evaluated at 6 months for Body Image after BreastCancer Questionnaire (BIBCQ) to assess possible changes in self-perception ofbody image and limitations. A second questionnaire explored the impact of EBRT,IORT-f and IORT-b on resumption of work and normal daily activities.RESULTS: EBRT had a higher risk of breast fibrosis and retraction (OR 3.58, 95%CI 1.024-12.526, p = 0.046) and breast edema (OR 6, 95% CI 2.077-17.335,p = 0.001) compared to IORT-f, but a lower risk of seroma compared to IORT-b (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.166-0.785, p = 0.01). The BIBCQ scores showed a better outcome in arm concerns with IORT-f (-3.3) vs. IORT-b (-1.3, p = 0.002) and EBRT (-1.7,p = 0.006), although biased by the lower rate in axillary dissections. Return to daily activities occurred after 70.6 days with EBRT vs. 41 days with IORT-f(p < 0.0001) and 53.3 days with IORT-b (p = 0.07), without any effect of age oraxillary dissection.CONCLUSION: IORT could reduce adverse effects, allowing faster resumption of job and houseworks.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
