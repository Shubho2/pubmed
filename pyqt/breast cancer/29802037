Email: san@ncat.eduObjective: Korean American (KA) immigrant women underutilize breast cancerscreening. This study examined factors predicting breast cancer screeningbehavior among KA women in the United States. Methods: 233 KA women aged 19 to 85were recruited in the metro area of Atlanta, Georgia. Andersenâ€™s behavioral modeltheoretically guided the study. Result: Of the predisposing factors, age(OR=1.043, p<.01, 95% CI [1.017, 1.069]) and marital status (OR=2.154, p<.05, 95%CI [1.022, 4.539]) were significantly associated with clinical breast exam (CBE),while income (OR=2.289, p<.05, 95% CI [1.060, 4.945]) and annual checkup(OR=2.725, p<.01, 95% CI [1.342, 5.533]) were linked to CBE as enabling factors. For the receipt of mammographic screening, annual checkup was only significantly associated among enabling factors (OR=4.509, p<.05, 95% CI [1.263, 16.102]),while family cancer history was identified as the only significant need factor(OR=.112, p<.01, 95% CI [.023, .552]). Conclusion: Differing factors explainedthe receipt of CBEs and mammographic use among KA women. Specifically, thefindings shed light on the importance of having an annual checkup for the uptake of both CBEs and mammographic use. Intervention strategies should focus onpromoting health accessibility for KA women to adhere to recommended breastcancer screening.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.5.1281 PMCID: PMC6031831PMID: 29802037
