To avoid limitations in application due to mass production of recombinant protein, we attempted to develop a novelpeptide inhibitor from UK1 sequence consisting of 83 amino acids that containsα-helices, loops and β-sheets. We dissected UK1 sequence to seven peptides based on structure and amino acid characteristics, and examined the anti-angiogenicactivities for the constructed peptides. Among the tested peptides, UP-7 mostpotently inhibited the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro, and also potently inhibited in vivo angiogenesis in the mouse matrigelplug assay. Such anti-angiogenic activities were not exerted by the scrambledpeptide. At molecular level, UP-7 inhibited growth factor-induced phosphorylationof FAK and ERK1/2. It also suppressed formation of stress fibers and focaladhesions and also inhibited the attachment and spreading of ECs onto immobilizedfibronectin. In a lung cancer animal model xenografted with non-UP-7-sensitiveNCI-H460 cells, systemic treatment of UP-7 effectively suppressed tumor growththrough inhibition of angiogenesis. Interestingly, breast cancer cells such asLM-MDA-MB-231 cells were moderately sensitive to UP-7 in proliferationdifferently from other cancer cells. UP-7 also inhibited migration, invasion and FAK phosphorylation of LM-MDA-MB-231 cells. Accordingly, UP-7 potently inhibited lung metastatic growth of LM-MDA-MB-231 cells in an experimental metastasismodel. Taken together, these results suggest that novel peptide UP-7 can beeffectively used for treatment of breast cancer metastatic growth throughinhibition of angiogenesis and invasion.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24131 PMCID: PMC5839413PMID: 29515782
