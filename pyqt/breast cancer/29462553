It is desirable and beneficial to treat TNBC cells of differentphenotypes with the most appropriate drugs. Here, we report a 78 nm, chlorin e6-,docetaxel-, and anti-Twist siRNA-containing polymeric nanoparticle (CDTN) withspatiotemporally specific activity when irradiated by light. Under conditionsmimicking superficial tumor tissue with sufficient light input, TNBC cells aremainly killed by the photodynamic therapy (PDT) function of CDTNs. In contrast,under conditions mimicking deep tumor tissue with weak light input, PDTpotentiates chemotherapy (CT) and gene therapy (GT) by facilitating theendolysosomal escape of CDTNs. Compared with free drugs, CDTNs improve theintratumoral exposure of docetaxel and anti-Twist siRNA by 2.5- and 2-fold,respectively. When combined with laser irradiation applied at the time of maximalintratumoral accumulation, the CDTNs significantly inhibit the growth of primary tumors and their lung metastasis (both >80%) by killing the peripheral cells,mainly through PDT and prohibiting the growth and metastasis of deep cellsthrough PDT as enhanced CT and GT. On the contrary, dual-modality nanomedicinelacking CT, GT, or PDT showed fast primary tumor growth, poor metastasis control,or both, respectively. This study reveals the spatiotemporally specific mechanismof CDTNs in treating metastatic TNBC and highlights the importance of combinedtherapy in treating TNBC.DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.7b09210 PMID: 29462553
