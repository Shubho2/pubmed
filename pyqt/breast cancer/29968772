This study examined the capability of nanofluidic proteomics to identifyaberrations in the MAPK signaling cascade, monitor its drug response, and guidethe rational design of intervention strategies. Specifically, the proteinpost-translational modification (PTM) profiles of MEK1, MEK2, and ERK1/2 weremeasured in breast carcinoma and breast cancer cell lines. Nanofluidic proteomicsrevealed hyper-phosphorylation of MAPKs in breast carcinoma and breast cancercells treated with kinase inhibitors that interfere with cell cycle regulation,such as dinaciclib, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, and rigosertib, an inhibitor of polo-like kinase 1. A pMEK1 (Thr286) phosphor-isoform, which serves as a biomarker of cell cycle-regulated negative feedback phosphorylation inbreast cancer cells, was detected in breast carcinoma. Inhibition of the MAPKpathway with dabrafenib, a B-Raf inhibitor, or trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor,suppressed both the positively regulated phosphorylation of MAPKs and thenegatively regulated phosphorylation of MEK1. Interestingly, the combinations of dabrafenib and rigosertib or trametinib and rigosertib permitted the suppression of positively regulated MAPK phosphorylation together with the promotion ofnegatively regulated MEK1 phosphorylation. The effectiveness of proteinPTM-guided drug combinations for inhibition of the MAPK pathway remains to beexperimentally tested. Via protein PTM profiling, nanofluidic proteomics providesa robust means to detect anomalies in the MAPK signaling cascade, monitor itsdrug response, and guide the possible design of drug combinations for MAPKpathway-focused targeting.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-28335-8 PMCID: PMC6030070PMID: 29968772
