Electronic address: mashraf@vt.edu.The enantiomeric separation of a racemate of 7-oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptenesulfonate (OBHS) derivatives, a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM), wasobtained using supercritical fluid chromatography in tandem with UV and massspectrometry (SFC/UV and SFC/MS, respectively). Supercritical CO2 modified withmethanol or isopropyl alcohol was used with isopropylamine (IPAm), trimethylamine(TEA), or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as an additive to obtain the enantiomersseparations. Both Chiralpak IC and IA were evaluated for the separation ofenantiomers. Results showed enantiomers separation can be achieved in less than5 min with a resolution greater than 1 and 0.9, respectively, for the differentOBHS derivatives (compounds A and B) using supercritical CO2 modified with 40%isopropyl alcohol containing 0.25% IPAm and IC column applying isocraticconditions. Similar conditions were used with the semi-preparative Chiralpak ICcolumn to isolate more than 50 mg of each enantiomer. SFC/MS and SFC/UV resultsshowed pure enantiomers were isolated. Method development via SFC was muchsimpler than those reported in the literature using HPLC.Published by Elsevier B.V.DOI: 10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.06.019 PMID: 29933221  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
