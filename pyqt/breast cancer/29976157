This orphan disease is morefrequent in North Africa. Despite intensive treatment, the survival rate remains very low.METHODS: We have retrospectively studied all breast cancer cases diagnosed at theNational Oncology Institute (INO), Rabat between 2005 and 2010. We have collected219 cases of women with metastatic and non-metastatic IBC. Data have beenobtained from patients' personal medical files over a follow-up period of5 years. We have described IBC's clinicopathological features and analyzed itsclinical outcome using SPSS software. HR (hazard Ratio) was calculated using Cox regression analysis.RESULTS: The frequency of IBC cases is 4.05%. The majority of our patients(65.3%) were under 50 years old. The most prevalent molecular subtype was LuminalA (38.7%) followed by Luminal B HER2+ (27.9%) and Triple negative (21.6%). Duringthe follow-up period, 72 patients (32.9%) had recurrence and 40 patients (18.3%) died. The 3-year OS (Overall Survival) and EFS (Event Free Survival) ofnon-metastatic patients were 70.4 and 46.5% respectively, while in the metastaticdisease, the 3-year OS was only 41.9%. In non-metastatic women, we observed ahigher rate of EFS associated to Selective estrogen receptor modulation treatment(p = 0.01), and a lower rate EFS in triple negative breast cancer patients(p = 0.02). In univariate analysis, we found that EFS rate is lower in patientspresenting Triple Negative tumors when compared to other molecular subtypes (HR: 3.54; 95%CI: 1.13-11.05; p = 0.02). We also found that Selective estrogenreceptor modulation treatment is associated with higher EFS rate (HR: 0.48;95%CI: 0.07-0.59; p = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: IBC in Morocco shows similar characteristics to those in NorthAfrican countries; however, survival rates are still the highest when comparedwith neighboring countries. Collaborative studies with prospective aspects arewarranted to establish the epidemiological profile and understand the highfrequencies of IBC in North Africa. More studies on molecular markers are alsoneeded to improve IBC patients' management and eventually their survival rate.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4634-9 PMCID: PMC6034251PMID: 29976157
