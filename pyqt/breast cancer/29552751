Key words used werebreast cancer, young women, health related quality of life, and quality of life.RESULTS: Young women reported fatigue, pain in the breast and hand problems with lymphedema as the most frequent physical effects of treatment. Other physicalproblems were the not periodic and painful menses, vaginal dryness and loss oflibido. Many young women had depressive symptoms such as depressed mood,helplessness, hopelessness, sleep loss, psychomotor retardation and disorders of appetite. There were often concerns about the health monitoring and self-image,while they were anxious if they will have a baby in the future or if they cannurture the existing ones. Many problems arose in the career of young women. Theyfaced discrimination in the labor supply and/or layoff because they wereconsidered unable to do their job effectively. In addition, they reportedisolation problems and feeling different from other women of similar age.CONCLUSIONS: Young women consider that their healthrelated QoL is worse compared with older women. Young women worry about their future, with particular referenceto their role as mothers and especially to children-bearing. The free screeningand non-exclusion of young women is particularly important for breast cancerprevention and women's well-being.PMID: 29552751
