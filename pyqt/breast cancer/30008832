China.Magnetic resonance imaging exhibits high sensitivity but low specificity forbreast cancer. The present study aimed to investigate whether combiningmorphology, texture features and kinetic features with diffusion-weighted imagingusing quantitative analysis improves the accuracy of discriminating malignantfrom benign breast masses. In total, 104 and 171 malignant lesions in 205 womenwere included. Additionally, 13 texture and 11 morphology features were computed from each lesion using a semi-automated segmentation method. To increaseprediction accuracy, a newly designed classification model, difference-weightedlocal hyperplane, was used for statistical analysis of the combined effects ofthe features for predicting lesion type. The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value for each lesion was calculated. Diagnostic performances of morphologyand texture features, kinetic features and ADC alone and the combination of them were evaluated using receiver operating characteristics analysis. Malignantlesions had lower mean ADCs than benign lesions. By using 10-fold crossvalidation scheme, combined morphological and kinetic features achieved adiagnostic average accuracy of 0.87. Adding an ADC threshold of 1.37Ã—10-3 mm2/secincreased the overall averaged accuracy to 0.90. A multivariate model combiningADC values with 6 morphological and kinetic parameters best discriminatedmalignant from benign lesions. Incorporating morphology and texture features,kinetic features and ADC into a multivariable diagnostic model improves thediscriminatory power of breast lesions.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8805 PMCID: PMC6036451PMID: 30008832
