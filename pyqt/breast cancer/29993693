[Epub ahead of print]An efficient mixed-model for screening differentially expressed genes of breastcancer based on LR-RF.Sun M, Ding T, Tang XQ, Yu K.To screen differentially expressed genes quickly and efficiently in breastcancer, two gene microarray datasets of breast cancer, GSE15852 and GSE45255,were downloaded from GEO. By combining the Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithm, this paper proposed a novel method named LR-RF to selectdifferentially expressed genes of breast cancer on microarray data by theBonferroni test of FWER error measure. Comparing with Logistic Regression andRandom Forest, our study shows that LR-FR has a great facility in selectingdifferentially expressed genes. The average prediction accuracy of the proposedLR-RF from replicating random test ten times surprisingly reaches 93.11% withvariance as low as 0.00045. The prediction accuracy rate reaches a maximum 95.57%when threshold value in the random forest algorithm process of ranking genesimportance score, and the differentially expressed genes are relatively few innumber. In addition, through analyzing the gene interaction networks, most of thetop 20 genes we selected were found to involve in the development of breastcancer. All of these results demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of LR-RF.It is anticipated that LR-RF would provide new knowledge and method forbiologists, medical scientists, and cognitive computing researchers to identifydisease-related genes of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1109/TCBB.2018.2829519 PMID: 29993693
