Secondary lymphedema is a progressive and incurable condition, most oftenmanifesting after surgery for breast cancer. Although its causation appearscomplex, various lines of evidence indicate that genetic predisposition may play a role. Previous studies show that mutations in connexin 47 are associated withsecondary lymphedema. We have tested the hypothesis that connexin 37 genemutations in humans are associated with secondary lymphedema following breastcancer surgery. A total of 2211 breast cancer patients were screened and testedfor reference single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the GJA4 gene (gapjunction protein alpha 4 gene). The results presented in this paper indicate thattwo SNPs in the 3' UTR (the three prime untranslated region) of the GJA4 gene areassociated with an increased risk of secondary lymphedema in patients undergoing breast cancer treatment. Our results provide evidence of a novel geneticbiomarker for assessing the predisposition to secondary lymphedema in humanbreast cancer patients. Testing for the condition-associated alleles describedhere could assist and inform treatment and post-operative care plans of breastcancer patients, with potentially positive outcomes for the management of diseaseprogression.DOI: 10.3390/biomedicines6010023 PMCID: PMC5874680PMID: 29470392
