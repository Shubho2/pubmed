The study consisted of two parts:dose-escalation part and safety-expansion part. BEZ235 was administered as asingle agent to patients with solid tumors or in combination with trastuzumab forHER2+ advanced breast cancer (aBC). Primary end points were MTD, safety, andtolerability. The secondary end point was pharmacokinetics. Other formulations ofBEZ235, solid dispersion system (SDS) sachet, and SDS capsules were alsoassessed.RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were enrolled; single-agent BEZ235was administered as hard gelatin capsule (n = 59), SDS capsules A and B (n = 33),and SDS sachet (n = 61), amongst which SDS sachet was chosen as the preferredformulation. The monotherapy MTD for capsule A and SDS sachet was determined tobe 1000 and 1200 mg/day, respectively. Thirty patients with HER2+ aBC receivedBEZ235 in combination with trastuzumab. The MTD of BEZ235 in combination withtrastuzumab was 600 mg/day. A total of four patients (13.3%) achieved partialresponse across the different groups. Most frequent AEs in single agent andcombination cohorts included nausea (80.3 and 93.3%), diarrhea (75.4 and 80.0%), and vomiting (63.9 and 63.3%).CONCLUSIONS: The MTD of BEZ235 as single agent was 1200 and 600 mg/day withtrastuzumab. Pharmacokinetic profiles showed low-to-moderate variability at lowdose (10 mg) and high variability at high doses (100 mg and above).Gastrointestinal AEs were frequent at high doses.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3610-z PMID: 29882016
