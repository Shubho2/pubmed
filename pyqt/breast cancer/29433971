Electronic address: clare.turnbull@icr.ac.uk.Testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT), the most common cancer in young men, has asignificant heritable basis that has long raised questions as to the existence ofunderlying major high-penetrance susceptibility gene(s). To determine thecontribution of rare gene mutations to the inherited risk of TGCT, we analysedgermline whole-exome data for 919 TGCT cases and 1609 cancer-free controls. Wecompared frequencies between TGCT cases and controls of rare (<1%) andlow-frequency (1-5%) coding variants (1) individually and (2) collapsed at thegene level via burden testing (T1, disruptive; T2, all deleterious; and T3, allnonsynonymous) using Fisher's exact test with Bonferroni correction ofsignificance thresholds. No individual variant or individual gene showed asignificant association with TGCT after correction for multiple testing. In thelargest whole-exome sequencing study of testicular cancer reported to date, ourfindings do not support the existence of a major high-penetrance TGCTsusceptibility gene (of odds ratio >10 and allele frequency [combined]>0.01%).Owing to its power, this study cannot exclude the existence of susceptibilitygenes responsible for occasional TGCT families or of rare mutations that confervery modest relative risks. In concert with findings from genome-wide associationstudies, our data support the notion that inherited susceptibility is largelypolygenic with substantial contribution from common variation.PATIENT SUMMARY: Inthe largest study of its kind, we sequenced ∼20 000 genes in 919 men withtesticular germ cell tumour (TGCT) and 1609 TGCT-free individuals and found noevidence of a single major gene underlying predisposition to TGCT (in the manner of BRCA1 for breast cancer). Instead, familial risk of TGCT is likely to be dueto varying dosages of hundreds of minor genetic factors.Copyright © 2018 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V.
