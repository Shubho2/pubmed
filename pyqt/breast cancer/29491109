This is similar to ratesin Central Eastern Europe. In order to reduce breast cancer mortality, theparticipation rate should be at least 70%. This questionnaire-based studyassessed the barriers associated with low adherence rates.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women 45-65 years of age were interviewed by questionnairecontaining 15 structured questions focused on socioeconomic status and barriersto screening.RESULTS: A total of 3,313 women completed the questionnaire. The main reasons foravoiding screening were work absenteeism (18.9%), fear of painful examination(18.39%), and poor understanding of mammography screening (14.94%).CONCLUSION: Education is required to increase awareness among women about theutility and availability of breast screening services. This report providesinformation on the appropriate level of intervention needed to increase screeningparticipation in Hungary and other developing countries in Central Eastern Europeto reduce breast cancer-related mortality.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12408 PMID: 29491109  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
