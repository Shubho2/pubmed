Criteria to standardize referral have been endorsed,but their application is yet to be tested at the population level.OBJECTIVES: This study sought to establish the need for standardized referral by examining current end-of-life care outcomes of decedents with cancer and definetransition points within a cancer illness course, which are associated with poor prognosis, whereby palliative care should be routinely introduced to augmentclinician-based decision making.METHODS: Population cohort study of admitted patients with advanced cancerdiagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC),prostate or breast cancer between 2000 and 2010 in Victoria, Australia,identified from routinely collected, linked, hospital discharge, emergencydepartment, and death registration data. Descriptive statistics described qualityindicators for end-of-life care outcomes for decedents. Kaplan-Meier analyseswere used to test the predefined transition point that mostly accuratelypredicted survival of six months or lesser.RESULTS: About 46,700 cases (56% females) were admitted with metastatic NSCLC(n = 14,759; 31.6%), SCLC (n = 2932; 6%), prostate (n = 9445; 20.2%), and breast cancer (n = 19,564; 41.9%). Of the 29,680 decedents, most (80%) died in hospital,had suboptimal end-of-life care outcomes (83%), and 59% received a palliativeapproach to care, a median of 27 days before death. Transition points in thecancer illness course of all cases were identified as first admission with anymetastatic disease (NSCLC: 3.8 months [interquartile range {IQR} 1.1, 16.0];n = 14,666; and SCLC: 4.2 months [IQR 1.0, 10.6]; n = 2914); first multidayadmission with any metastatic disease (prostate: 6.0 months [IQR 1.3, 26.4];n = 7174); and first multiday admission with at least one visceral metastaticsite (breast: 6.0 months [IQR 1.2, 29.8]; n = 7120).CONCLUSION: Despite calls for integrated palliative care, this occurs late or notat all for many patients with cancer. Our findings demonstrate the application oftargeted cancer-specific transition points to trigger integration of palliativecare as a standard part of quality oncological care and augment clinician-basedreferral in routine clinical practice.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.
