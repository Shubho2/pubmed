Oncological safety, postoperative complications, and cosmeticresults were retrospectively analyzed in patients who underwent extended LD flap breast reconstruction following SSM between October 2011 and August 2014. A totalof 62 patients who underwent 63 breast reconstructions were enrolled in thestudy. Local recurrence rate was 1.6% over a median follow-up of 63 months. Onfinal aesthetic assessment, 37 reconstructions were rated excellent, 19 good, 5fair, and 2 poor. Reconstruction-related complications occurred in 22 patients(34.9%); these patients' satisfaction scores were significantly lower than those of patients without complications (P < .05). Five patients developed shouldermovement limitation, and 2 had minor twitching and pain in the reconstructedbreast. However, these patients did not find their problems disabling and wereable to live normally. SSM followed by breast reconstruction with extended LDflap can improve patients' postoperative quality of life and is as oncologically safe as total mastectomy even in patients with tumors of relatively late stage.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010936 PMID: 30075492  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
