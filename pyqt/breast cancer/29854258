Gaining intuition into their adherencebehavior would assist in improving outcomes by pinpointing, and eventuallyaddressing, why patients fail to adhere. While traditional adherence studies relyon survey-based methods or electronic medical records, online health communities provide a supplemental data source to learn about such behavior and often on amuch larger scale. In this paper, we focus on an online breast cancer discussion forum and propose a framework to automatically extract hormonal therapy adherencebehavior (HTAB) mentions. The framework compares medical term usage whendescribing when a patient is taking hormonal therapy medication and interrupting their treatment (e.g., stop/pause taking medication). We show that by usingshallow neural networks, in the form of wordlvec, the learned features can beapplied to build efficient HTAB mention classifiers. Through medical termcomparison, we find that patients who exhibit an interruption behavior are morelikely to mention depression and their care providers, while patients withcontinuation behavior are more likely to mention common side effects (e.g., hotflashes, nausea and osteoporosis), vitamins and exercise.PMCID: PMC5977653PMID: 29854258
