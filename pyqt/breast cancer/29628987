This study wasperformed to evaluate the rate of upgrading to malignancy or high-risk lesionsafter excision and to identify factors associated with upgrading using a largeseries of benign IDP cases without atypia.Methods: We included patients who were diagnosed as having benign IDP withoutatypia on CNB and underwent surgical or vacuum-assisted excision between 2010 and2015. We analyzed the clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of IDPs that were upgraded to malignancy or high-risk lesions after excision.Results: A total of 511 benign IDPs without atypia diagnosed via CNB wereidentified, of which 398 cases were treated with excision. After reviewing these cases, four cases of high-risk lesions in adjacent tissue on CNB, two cases whichwere revealed as papilloma with atypia, and nine cases of malignancy in the same breast were excluded. In the remaining 383 cases, the rate of upgrading tomalignancy and high-risk lesions after excision was 0.8% and 4.4%, respectively. The presence of concurrent contralateral breast cancer, the presence of symptoms,and multifocality were factors significantly associated with upgrading tomalignancy on subsequent excision. Surgical excision rather than vacuum-assisted excision was significantly associated with upgrading to high-risk lesions ormalignancy.Conclusion: The rate of upgrading to malignancy for benign IDP without atypia wasvery low, suggesting that close clinical and radiologic observation may besufficient for patients with benign IDP without atypia on CNB under propersettings.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.1.80 PMCID: PMC5880969PMID: 29628987
