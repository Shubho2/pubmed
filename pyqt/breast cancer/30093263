MBC is also morelikely to have lymph node (LN) involvement than FBC.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sought to determine the prognostic role of the examinedlymph node (LN), negative LN (NLN), and positive LN counts and the LN ratio(LNR), defined as (positive LNs/ENLs), on the survival rate among MBC patients.We performed a large population-based study using the data from the Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End Results program.RESULTS: Older age, black race, stage IV disease, ≤ 1 NLN, and a > 31.3% LNR weresignificantly associated with worse survival across all prediction models.Moreover, we demonstrated a decreased risk of mortality in MBC patients acrossthe MBC-specific survival model (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval,0.96-0.998; P = .03) and 10-year MBC-specific survival model (hazard ratio, 0.98;95% confidence interval, 0.96-0.999; P = .04).CONCLUSION: MBC has had an augmented incidence over the years. We found severalindependent predictors of MBC survival, including age, race, stage, NLNs, and theLNR. We strongly suggest adding the NLN count and/or LNR into the current stagingsystem. Further studies are needed to provide information on the mechanismsunderlying the association between the NLN count and MBC survival and the LNR andMBC survival.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
