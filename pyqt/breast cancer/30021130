Synthesized lipids as energetic sources are consumed by cancercells for proliferation, growth, survival, invasion and angiogenesis. Fatty acidsas signaling compounds regulate metabolic and transcriptional networks, survival pathways and inflammatory responses. Aggregation of fatty acids with fatty acidbinding proteins (FABPs) facilitates their transportation to different cellorganelles. FABPs, a group of lipid binding proteins modulate fatty acidmetabolism, cell growth and proliferation and cancer development. They may beused as tumor marker in some cancers. FABPs are expressed in most malignanciessuch as prostate, breast, liver, bladder and lung cancer which are associatedwith the incidence, proliferation, metastasis, invasion of tumors. This reviewintroduces several isoforms of FABPs (FABP1-12) and summarizes their function andtheir possible roles in cancer development through some proposed mechanisms.Copyright Â© 2018.
