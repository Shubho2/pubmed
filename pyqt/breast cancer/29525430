Electronic address:c.j.twelves@leeds.ac.uk.Trastuzumab improves survival outcomes for patients with HER2-positive (HER2+)breast cancer, yet not all such women receive this important therapy. Trastuzumabwas approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1998 and the EuropeanMedicines Agency in 2000 as treatment for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC).Observational studies between 2000 and 2015 in patients with HER2+ MBC suggestthat nearly 12% in the United States, 27% to 54% in Europe, and 27.1% to 49.2% inChina did not receive trastuzumab or any other HER2-targeted agent as first-and/or later-line for treatment of metastatic disease. In 2006, both agenciesapproved trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with HER2+ early breastcancer (EBC). Observational studies on real-world treatment patterns for HER2+EBC between 2005 and 2015 suggest that 19.1% to 59.5% of patients across regions of North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and China did not receive(neo)adjuvant trastuzumab. Data suggest that some patient subgroups, includingolder patients, those with HER2+/hormone receptor-positive disease, and womenwith small and/or node-negative HER2+ tumors, were less likely to receiveanti-HER2 therapy. Barriers to accessing trastuzumab are multifactorial andinclude issues related to drug funding and high treatment costs for patients thathave been reported worldwide. Herein, we review available literature on the useof, and barriers to, treatment with trastuzumab in patients with HER2+ breastcancer. We also discuss how the availability of safe and effective biosimilarsmight increase access to trastuzumab and allow greater use of anti-HER2 therapy, potentially improving patient outcomes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
