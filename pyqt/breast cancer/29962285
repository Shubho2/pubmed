Our studyaimed to analyze surgical outcomes of post-ablation cases to investigate theeffectiveness and safety of thermal ablation in primary PTC. Methods Weretrospectively searched for primary PTC patients treated with thermal ablationfrom our medical record database prior to August 2017. The surgical patients met the following criteria: 1) primary PTC treated with thermal ablation, 2) withfindings suspicious for malignancy of the post-ablation lesions on ultrasound(US) or malignancy confirmed by cytology, or with clinical evidence of cervicallymph node metastasis (LNM), 3) written informed consent for surgery, 4)preference for definite diagnosis of the post-ablation lesions for the patientswithout evidence for malignant findings, 5) tolerance of a thyroidectomy andwithout severe illness. Moreover, a systematic review of the literature was made to analyze relevant cases. Results Twelve patients with an average age of41.0±13.6 years constituted the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC)cohort in our study. Twenty-two foci with a mean size of 1.3±0.7 cm were ablated percutaneously under ultrasound guidance. Residual PTCs were confirmed in allcases by histopathology, and LNM was present in 66.7% (8/12) of the patients.Intraoperatively, adhesion of the post-ablation lesions with strap muscle wasobserved in six cases. Strap muscle was found to be cauterized in five cases, andnotably the recurrent laryngeal nerve was involved in one case. Furthermore,seven relevant studies from Korea, Italy and China were retrospectively reviewed,and incomplete ablation of primary PTC and omission of LNM by thermal ablationwere observed frequently. Conclusions Surgical therapy demonstrated incompleteablation of primary PTC and omission of LNM by thermal ablation in this cohort ofpatients. We suggest that thermal ablation should be recommended with caution as treatment of operable patients with primary PTC.DOI: 10.1089/thy.2017.0558 PMID: 29962285
