Recent studies have suggested that collagen-fiber mediated forcetransmission in cellularized ECM plays an important role in stress homeostasisand regulation of collective cellular behaviors. Motivated by the recent in vitroobservation that oriented collagen can significantly enhance the penetration ofmigrating breast cancer cells into dense Matrigel which mimics the intravasation process in vivo [Han et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 113, 11208(2016)PNASA60027-842410.1073/pnas.1610347113], we devise a procedure forgenerating realizations of highly heterogeneous 3D collagen networks withprescribed microstructural statistics via stochastic optimization. Specifically, a collagen network is represented via the graph (node-bond) model and themicrostructural statistics considered include the cross-link (node) density,valence distribution, fiber (bond) length distribution, as well as fiberorientation distribution. An optimization problem is formulated in which theobjective function is defined as the squared difference between a set of targetmicrostructural statistics and the corresponding statistics for the simulatednetwork. Simulated annealing is employed to solve the optimization problem byevolving an initial network via random perturbations to generate realizations of homogeneous networks with randomly oriented fibers, homogeneous networks withaligned fibers, heterogeneous networks with a continuous variation of fiberorientation along a prescribed direction, as well as a binary system containing acollagen region with aligned fibers and a dense Matrigel region with randomlyoriented fibers. The generation and propagation of active forces in the simulatednetworks due to polarized contraction of an embedded ellipsoidal cell and a smallgroup of cells are analyzed by considering a nonlinear fiber model incorporating strain hardening upon large stretching and buckling upon compression. Ouranalysis shows that oriented fibers can significantly enhance long-range forcetransmission in the network. Moreover, in the oriented-collagen-Matrigel system, the forces generated by a polarized cell in collagen can penetrate deeply intothe Matrigel region. The stressed Matrigel fibers could provide contact guidance for the migrating cell cells, and thus enhance their penetration into Matrigel.This suggests a possible mechanism for the observed enhanced intravasation byoriented collagen.DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.97.033311 PMID: 29776156
