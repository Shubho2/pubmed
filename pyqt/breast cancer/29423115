In order to derive a more definitive conclusion, weperformed this meta-analysis. We searched in the databases of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane for eligible publications. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess the strength of association between CYP17T-34C polymorphism and breast cancer risk. Forty-nine studies involving 2,7104cases and 3,4218 control subjects were included in this meta-analysis. Inoverall, no significant association between CYP17 T-34C polymorphism and breastcancer susceptibility was found among general populations. In the stratifiedanalysis by ethnicity and source, significant associations were still notdetected in all genetic models; besides, limiting the analysis to studies withcontrols in agreement with HWE, we also observed no association between CYP17T-34C polymorphism and breast cancer risk. For premenopausal women, we didn'tdetect an association between rs743572 and breast cancer risk; however, amongpostmenopausal women, we observed that the association was statisticallysignificant under the allele contrast genetic model (OR = 1.10, 95% CI =1.03-1.17, P = 0.003), but not in other four models. In conclusion, rs743572 may increase breast cancer risk in postmenopausal individuals, but not inpremenopausal folks and general populations.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23688 PMCID: PMC5790532PMID: 29423115
