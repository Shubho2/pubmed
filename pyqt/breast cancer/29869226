Histological analysis included:histological features (histological type, necrosis, vascular invasion and Mib-1),immunohistochemical characterization (immunophenotype, receptor status, HER2-neu and grading) and loco-regional characteristics (T and N). The kinetic MR featuresanalyzed were: curve type, maximum enhancement, time to peak, wash-in andwash-out rate, brevity of enhancement and area under curve.RESULTS: MRI kinetic parameters and immunohistological features were comparedusing chi square test, two-tailed student t test and Anova test, with p = 0.05level of significance. Vascular invasion was shown to be significantly related totime to peak (p = 0.02). The immunohistotype was shown to be significantlyrelated with maximum enhancement (p = 0.05), time to peak (p = 0.04) and wash-in rate (p = 0.01). ER status correlates with maximum and relative enhancement(p = 0.004 and p = 0.028), wash-in rate (p = 0.0018) and area under curve(p = 0.006). PR status was significantly related to time to peak (p = 0.048) and wash-in rate (p = 0.05).CONCLUSION: Maximum enhancement absolute and relative, time to peak, wash-in rateand area under the curve significantly correlate with several prognostic factors,like ER status, immune profile and tumoral vascular invasion, and may predict theaggressiveness of the tumor.DOI: 10.1007/s11547-018-0908-1 PMID: 29869226
