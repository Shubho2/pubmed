It has been suggested that a type of microcirculation pattern that does not rely on host microvascularendothelial cells known as vasculogenic mimicry (VM) may contribute to the pooreffect of anti‑angiogenesis treatment on some patients with breast cancer.However, the formation and regulatory mechanism of VM in breast cancer areunclear and still require further investigation. The present study examinedwhether decreasing the expression of zinc finger E‑box binding homeobox (ZEB1)using siRNA can inhibit the formation of VM in Triple Negative Breast Cancer(TNBC), and its specific function and molecular mechanism. mRNA and proteinexpression were detected by RT‑qPCR and western blotting. Invasion assay and tubeformation assay were also performed. The results demonstrated that ZEB1 smallhairpin (sh)RNA inhibited the formation of VM. Knockdown of ZEB1 markedlyinhibited the expression of vimentin in MDA‑MB‑231 cells and markedly increasedthe expression of E‑cadherin. It was suggested that ZEB1 shRNA may have inhibitedthe epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, ZEB1 shRNA inhibitedthe invasion of MDA‑MB‑231 cells and suppressed the expression of fetal liverkinase 1 (flk‑1). The flk‑1 inhibitor Semaxanib inhibited the formation of VM;thus, ZEB1 shRNA inhibited EMT and cell invasion, and may have inhibited theformation of VM through flk‑1. The present study contributed furtherunderstanding on the theory of tumor angiogenesis and provided theoretical basis for novel targeted therapy of TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8677 PMID: 29512767
