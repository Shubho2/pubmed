G2 arrest kineticsfollowing irradiation were obtained from two-color flow cytometric analysis andpedigrees of Fucci fluorescence. DNA double strand break repair kinetics wereobtained from immunofluorescence staining for phosphorylated histone H2AX,p53-binding protein 1, phosphorylated DNA-dependent protein kinase catalyticsubunit, and breast cancer susceptibility gene 1.RESULTS: Both cell lines showed apparent G2 arrest after 10 Gy of irradiation,but it was more enhanced in the HSC3-Fucci cells. Radiosensitivity was higher in the HSC3-Fucci cells than in HSC4-Fucci cells. Pedigree analysis of Fuccifluorescence revealed that the HSC3-Fucci cells exhibited a significantly longer green phase (normally indicating S/G2/M phases, but here reflective of G2 arrest)when irradiated in the red phase (G1 phase) than HSC4-Fucci cells irradiated ineither red or green phases. Non-homologous end joining was marginally suppressed during the G1 phase and markedly more likely to be impaired during the S/G2phases in HSC3-Fucci cells. When G2 arrest was abrogated by checkpoint kinase 1or Wee1 inhibitors, only HSC4-Fucci cells exhibited radiosensitization.CONCLUSIONS: We characterized DNA damage response in HSC3-Fucci and HSC4-Fuccicells following irradiation and the former demonstrated inefficientnon-homologous end joining, especially during the S/G2 phases, resulting inenhanced G2 arrest. These findings may have clinical implications for oralcancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.archoralbio.2018.02.016 PMID: 29522917
