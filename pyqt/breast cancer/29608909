Electronic address: rais@um.edu.my.We recently reported that methyl2-(-5-fluoro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-5-carboxylate (MBIC) is amicrotubule targeting agent (MTA) with multiple mechanisms of action includingapoptosis in two human breast cancer cell-lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. In thepresent study, investigation of early molecular events following MBIC treatmentdemonstrated the induction of autophagy. This early (<24 h) response to MBIC was characterized by accumulation of autophagy markers; LC3-II, Beclin1, autophagicproteins (ATGs) and collection of autophagosomes but with different variations inthe two cell-lines. MBIC-induced autophagy was associated with generation ofreactive oxygen species (ROS). In parallel, an increased activation of SAPK/JNKpathway was detected, as an intersection of ROS production and induction ofautophagy. The cytotoxic effect of MBIC was enhanced by inhibition of autophagythrough blockage of SAPK/JNK signaling, suggesting that MBIC-induced autophagy,is a possible cellular self-defense mechanism against toxicity of this agent inboth breast cancer cell-lines. The present findings suggest that inhibition ofautophagy eliminates the cytoprotective activity of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells,and sensitizes both the aggressive and non-aggressive human breast cancercell-lines to the cytotoxic effects of MBIC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
