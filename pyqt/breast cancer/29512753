China.(2)Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, SanDiego, CA 92093‑0651, USA.Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major problem in the treatment of breast cancer. In the present study, next-generation sequencing technology was employed toidentify differentially expressed genes in MCF‑7/MDR cells and MCF‑7 cells, andaimed to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of MDR in breast cancer.Differentially expressed genes between MCF‑7/MDR and MCF‑7 cells were selectedusing software; a total of 2085 genes were screened as differentially expressedin MCF‑7/MDR cells. Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia ofGenes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed using theDAVID database. Finally, a protein‑protein interaction network was constructedand the hub genes in the network were analyzed using the STRING database. GOannotation demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in various biological processes, including 'regulation of cell differentiation','cell development', 'neuron development', 'movement of cell or subcellularcomponent' and 'cell morphogenesis involved in neuron differentiation'. Cellular component analysis by GO revealed that differentially expressed genes wereenriched in 'plasma membrane region' and 'extracellular matrix' terms.Furthermore, KEGG analysis demonstrated that the target genes were enriched invarious pathways, including 'cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)', 'calcium signaling pathway', 'tight junction', 'Wnt signaling pathway' and 'pathways in cancer'terms. A protein‑protein interaction network demonstrated that certain hub genes,including cyclin D1, nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), NOTCH3, brain‑derivedneurotrophic factor (BDNF), paired box 6, neuropeptide Y, phospholipase C β(PLCB) 4, PLCB2 and actin α cardiac muscle 1, may be associated with MDR inbreast cancer. Subsequently, RT‑qPCR confirmed that the expression of these 9 hubgenes was higher in MCF‑7/MDR cells compared with MCF‑7 cells, consistent withthe RNA‑sequencing analysis. Additionally, a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assaydemonstrated that specific inhibitors of NOS3 and BDNF/neurotrophic receptortyrosine kinase, type 2 signaling reduced the IC50 of MCF‑7/MDR cells in responseto various anticancer drugs, including adriamycin, cisplatin and 5‑fluorouracil. The results of the present study provide novel insights into the mechanismunderlying MDR in MCF‑7 cells and may identify novel targets for the treatment ofbreast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8704 PMCID: PMC5928598PMID: 29512753
