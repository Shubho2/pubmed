To assess differences in survival, we selected aclinical control cohort (n = 57) based on criteria used to select patients forcapecitabine/RT. We also created a matched cohort (2:1), matching on tumorsubtype, pathological stage and age (< 50 or 50+ years). Differences in EFS,using STEEP criteria, and OS, using all-cause mortality, between those whoreceived capecitabine/RT and controls were assessed.RESULTS: Of the 21 women who received capecitabine/RT, median age was 52 years.The majority were pathologic stage III (n = 15) and hormonereceptor-positive/HER2-negative BC (n = 20). In those receiving capecitabine/RT, there were 9 events, compared with 14 events in clinical and 10 events in matchedcontrols. Capecitabine/RT was associated with worse OS in clinical (HR 3.83 95%CI 1.12-13.11, p = 0.03) and matched controls (HR 3.71 95% CI 1.04-13.18,p = 0.04), after adjusting for clinical size, pathological stage andlymphovascular invasion. Capecitabine/RT was also associated with a trend towardsworse EFS in clinical (HR 2.41 95% CI 0.86-6.74, p = 0.09) and matched controls(HR 2.68 95% CI 0.91-7.90, p = 0.07) after adjustment.CONCLUSION: Concurrent capecitabine/RT after NAC is associated with worsesurvival and should be carefully considered in BC.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1859-7 PMID: 29594944
