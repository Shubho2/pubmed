The experimental group underwent 12 weeks of belly dance classes, with a frequency of twice a week and duration of 60 min for each lesson. Datacollection was made through the use of questionnaires containing generalinformation, quality of life (EORTC QLQ-BR23), fatigue (Piper Fatigue Scale) and depressive symptoms (BECK's Depression Inventory) applied on baseline and afterintervention.RESULTS: The experimental group presented significant improvements after theintervention, with an increase in scores of the functional scale (p = 0.002):body image (p = 0.037) and sexual function (p = 0.027); and a decrease in scores of the symptomatic scale (p = 0.001): systemic therapy side effects (p = 0.005)and arm symptoms (p = 0.001) of quality of life, as well the decrease of fatigue (p = 0.036) and depressive symptoms (p = 0.002). No significant differences were observed in clinical and demographic information at baseline between theexperimental and control groups. Also, there was no significant difference onquality of life, fatigue, and depressive symptoms between the two groups.CONCLUSION: Belly dance can be a viable form of physical activity for women with breast cancer. It was associated with benefits for quality of life, fatigue, and depressive symptoms. Even though there were significant pre-post treatmentdifferences, there was no significance difference between the experimental andcontrol group; and therefore, treatment could have been due to natural history.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
