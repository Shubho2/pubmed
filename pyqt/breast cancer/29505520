About 5% to15% of the cases occurin the breast, and it is relatively rare in the axillary accessory breast. There are no effective preventive measures for GCTs, early detection combined with athorough and wide complete resection of the tumor remains the best treatment for a favorable outcome.DIAGNOSES: A 45-year-old female patient with an axillary mass of more than 3months duration was examined through physical examination, color Dopplerultrasound and postoperative pathology.INTERVENTIONS: A provisional diagnosis of left axillary lymph node enlargementwas made and necessary investigations were advised.OUTCOMES: A differential diagnosis of accessory breast in the left arm pit,possibly malignant, or a solid mass in the left arm pit secondary to chronicinflammation. Postoperative pathology: GCT of axillary accessory breast, withtumor-free margins. Immunohistochemical staining showed strong S-100 positivity, CD68 positivity, and negative periodic acid-Schiff staining.LESSONS: The ultrasound examination can detect GCT mass in the breast/accessorybreast and is not easy to misdiagnosis.Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors.
