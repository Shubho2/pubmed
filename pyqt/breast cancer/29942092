Although T cells are thepredominant TIL population2, the relationship between quantitative andqualitative differences in T cell subpopulations and patient prognosis remainsunknown. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 6,311â€‰T cellsisolated from human BCs and show that significant heterogeneity exists in theinfiltrating T cell population. We demonstrate that BCs with a high number ofTILs contained CD8+ T cells with features of tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cell differentiation and that these CD8+ TRM cells expressed high levels of immunecheckpoint molecules and effector proteins. A CD8+ TRM gene signature developedfrom the scRNA-seq data was significantly associated with improved patientsurvival in early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and provided better prognostication than CD8 expression alone. Our data suggest that CD8+ TRM cellscontribute to BC immunosurveillance and are the key targets of modulation byimmune checkpoint inhibition. Further understanding of the development,maintenance and regulation of TRM cells will be crucial for successfulimmunotherapeutic development in BC.DOI: 10.1038/s41591-018-0078-7 PMID: 29942092
