One of the most important advantages of flowcytometric cell surface proteomics is that it can be performed on living cellsthat can be sorted for further characterization and functional studies. Here, we document the surface proteome of clonogenic metastatic breast cancer (MBrCa)explants, which was strikingly similar to that of normal mesenchymal stromalcells (P = 0.017, associated with Pearson correlation coefficient) andtransformed mammary epithelial cells (P = 0.022). Markers specificallyupregulated on MBrCa included CD200 (Ox2), CD51/CD61 (Integrin α5/β3), CD26(dipeptidyl peptidase-4), CD165 (c-Cbl), and CD54 (ICAM-1). Proteinsprogressively upregulated in a model of neoplastic transformation and invasionincluded CD26, CD63 (LAMP3), CD105 (Endoglin), CD107a (LAMP1), CD108 (Semaphorin 7A), CD109 (Integrin β4), CD151 (Raph blood group), and disialoganglioside G2.The proteome of the commonly used cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF7, and BT-474 wereuncorrelated with that of MBrCa (P = 1.0, 1.0, 0.9, respectively). The comparisonhas demonstrated the mesenchymal nature of clonogenic cells isolated byshort-term culture of metastatic breast cancer, provided several leads forbiomarkers and potential targets for anti-invasive therapy, including CD200, and highlighted the limitations of breast cancer cell lines for representing the cellsurface biology of breast cancer. © 2017 International Society for Advancement ofCytometry.© 2018 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.DOI: 10.1002/cyto.a.23300 PMID: 29498809
