While p27, a tumor suppressor, inhibits progression from G1 to S phase, c-Myc, aproto-oncogene, plays a key role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Theobjective of our study was to determine the association between expression ofc-Myc and the loss of p27 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the four majorsubtypes of breast cancer (BC) (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2, and Triple Negative) and with other clinicopathological factors in a population of 202African-American (AA) women.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed from FFPE tumorblocks from primary ductal breast carcinomas in 202 AA women. Five micrometersections were stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against p27 and a rabbitmonoclonal antibody against c-Myc. The sections were evaluated for intensity ofnuclear reactivity (1-3) and percentage of reactive cells; an H-score was derivedfrom the product of these measurements.RESULTS: Loss of p27 expression and c-Myc overexpression showed statisticalsignificance with ER negative (p < 0.0001), PR negative (p < 0.0001), triplenegative (TN) (p < 0.0001), grade 3 (p = 0.038), and overall survival(p = 0.047). There was no statistical significant association between c-Mycexpression/p27 loss and luminal A/B and Her2 overexpressing subtypes.CONCLUSION: In our study, a statistically significant association between c-Mycexpression and p27 loss and the triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) was foundin AA women. A recent study found that constitutive c-Myc expression isassociated with inactivation of the axin 1 tumor suppressor gene. p27 inhibitscyclin dependent kinase2/cyclin A/E complex formation. Axin 1 and CDK inhibitors may represent possible therapeutic targets for TNBC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
