Menopausalsymptoms following breast cancer can occur at an earlier age, be more severe and significantly influence a woman's overall wellbeing, in particular, sexualfunction, quality of life and adherence to treatment. There is a dearth of goodquality evidence on the safest and most effective treatment options available forthese women, and this article aims to summarize the current available treatments.Pertinent to these women is general advice, such as avoidance of triggers, andlifestyle modifications. Following which, non-pharmacological interventions,including cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), hypnosis, acupuncture, stellateganglion nerve block and complementary agents, are discussed. Pharmacologicaltherapies and their safety profile in these high-risk women are then examined;namely, menopausal hormone therapy, progestogens, antidepressants (selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors),gabapentin, clonidine and intra-vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Finally,neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists, promising new agents for the treatment oftroublesome menopausal vasomotor symptoms, are discussed.DOI: 10.1007/s40266-018-0574-y PMID: 30073604
