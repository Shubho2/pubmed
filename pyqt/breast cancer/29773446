DIBHrequires sustaining chest wall expansion for up to 40 s and involves complexco-ordination of thoraco-abdominal muscles, which may not be intuitive topatients. We investigated the effect of in-advance preparatory DIBH coaching and home practice on cardiac doses.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Successive patients from 1 February 2015 to 31 December2016 with left-sided breast cancer who underwent tangential field radiotherapyutilising the DIBH technique were included. The study cohort consisted ofpatients treated by a physician who routinely provided DIBH coaching and homepractice instructions at least 5 days before simulation. The control groupincluded non-coached patients under another physician's care. Minimum, maximumand mean cardiac doses and V5, V10 and V30 from DIBH and free breathingsimulation computed tomography scans were obtained from the planning system. DIBHand free breathing cardiac doses and volume exposures were compared between thecoached and non-coached groups using the two-sample t-test, Fisher's exact testand the Mann-Whitney U-test.RESULTS: Twenty-seven coached and 42 non-coached patients were identified. TheDIBH maximum cardiac dose was lower in coached patients at 13.1 Gy compared with 19.4 Gy without coaching (P = 0.004). The percentage cardiac volume exposure inDIBH was lower in coached patients; the DIBH V10 was 0.5% without coaching and0.1% with coaching (P = 0.005). There was also a trend towards lower DIBH V5 inthe coached group compared with the non-coached group (1.2% versus 1.9%,P = 0.071). No significant differences in patient cardiopulmonary comorbidityfactors that might influence cardiac doses were found between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cardiac dose sparing can potentially befurther improved with a 5 day regimen of preparatory DIBH coaching and in-advancehome practice before simulation. These hypothesis-generating findings should beconfirmed in a larger study.Copyright © 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
