From the biopsy results, we diagnosed her with right breast cancer. Ather 33rd week of pregnancy, she underwent modified radical mastectomy (pT2N3aM0, Stage III C, ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-positive), and she elected to receiveadjuvant therapy after the surgery during her pregnancy. She received the firstcourse of EC (epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide) therapy on the 13th postoperativeday (35 weeks of gestation) and gave a natural, vaginal delivery at 36 weeks and 5 days of gestation. On the 4th day after birth, the patient noticed acontralateral left breast mass and was diagnosed with left breast cancer, aftercore needle biopsy. She received 4 courses of EC therapy and is currentlyundergoing PTX plus HER (paclitaxel plus trastuzumab) therapy. Regardingchemotherapy during pregnancy, we recommend that there is no need to performartificial preterm birth, because chemotherapy has little influence on childrenafter their second-trimester. After the second-trimester, chemotherapy can besafely performed.PMID: 30026449  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
