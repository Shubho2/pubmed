[Epub ahead of print]KDM6B counteracts EZH2-mediated suppression of IGFBP5 to confer resistance toPI3K/AKT inhibitor treatment in breast cancer.Wang W(1), Lim KG(1), Feng M(1), Bao Y(1), Lee PL(1), Yu C(2), Chen Y(3), ZhangH(4), Marzese D(5), Hoon DS(5), Yu Q(6).Author information: (1)Cancer Therapeutics and Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singapore.(2)School of Pharmacy and Cancer Research Institute, Jinan University.(3)Cancer Therapeutics and Stratified Oncology,, Genome Institute of Singapore.(4)School of Medicine, Jinan University.(5)Department of Molecular Oncology, John Wayne Cancer Institute.(6)Cancer Therapeutics and Stratified Oncology, Genome Institute of Singaporeyuq@gis.a-star.edu.sg.Despite showing promise against PIK3CA-mutant breast cancers in preclinicalstudies, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway inhibitors demonstrate limited clinical efficacy as monotherapy. Here, we found that histone H3K27me3demethylase KDM6B-targeted IGFBP5 expression provides a protective mechanism for PI3K/AKT inhibitor-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We found thatoverexpression of KDM6B and IGFBP5 in luminal breast cancer are positivelyassociated with poorer disease outcomes. Mechanistically, KDM6B promotes IGFBP5expression by antagonizing EZH2-mediated repression, and pharmacologic inhibitionof KDM6B augments apoptotic response to PI3K/AKT inhibitor treatment. Moreover,the IGFBP5 expression is upregulated upon acquired resistance to the PI3Kinhibitor GDC-0941, which is associated with an epigenetic switch from H3K27me3to H3K27Ac at the IGFBP5 gene promoter. Intriguingly, GDC-0941-resistant breastcancer cells remained sensitive to KDM6B or IGFBP5 inhibition, indicating thedependency on KDM6B-IGFBP5 axis to confer the survival advantage inGDC-0941-resistant cells. Our study reveals an epigenetic mechanism associatedwith resistance to targeted therapy and demonstrates that therapeutic targetingof KDM6B-mediated IGFBP5 expression may provide a useful approach to mitigateboth intrinsic and acquired resistance to the PI3K inhibitor in breast cancer.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-17-0802 PMID: 29925528
