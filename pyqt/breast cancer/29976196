Cancer statistics obtained fromspecific regions populated by distinct ethnic groups may vary considerably. Thereis no national cancer registry. To determine whether there are indeed significantstatistical differences in cancer incidence and prevalence, data was recordedfrom different parts of Pakistan based on the ethnic composition of thepopulation in those parts.METHODS: Ten papers (original articles) on cancer incidence and prevalence inPakistan published in the last two decades were selected from PubMed and GoogleScholar. Meta-analysis of findings of these studies was performed usingMeta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) checklist.Ï‡2-based I2 test was used for evaluating heterogeneity and Forest plots weregenerated for calculating unadjusted prevalence estimates. Oral, gastric,prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers were selected for meta-analysis. I2values of 75% or greater indicated high heterogeneity.RESULTS: All five types of cancer selected for meta-analysis (performed onstudies carrying similar statistical weights) showed extremely high heterogeneitywith I2 values of 99.7% for oral cancer, 98.6% for prostate cancer, 98.3% forgastric cancer, 99.8% for breast cancer, and 85.4% for colorectal cancer. pvalues for all cancers were highly statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the prevalence rates of different cancertypes demonstrate marked variation in different studies depending on the place oforigin of the study and dominant ethnic group in that region, and thesevariations are highly statistically significant. A national cancer registry needsto be established as soon as possible.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1429-z PMCID: PMC6034324PMID: 29976196
