EVs have garnered substantial research interest inrecent years, due to their potential utility as circulating biomarkers for avariety of diseases, including numerous types of cancer. The following reviewwill discuss the current understanding of the form and function of EVs, theirspecific role in cancer pathogenesis and their potential for non-invasive diseasediagnosis and/or monitoring. This review will also highlight several key issuesfor this field, including the importance of implementing robust and reproducible sample handling protocols, and the challenge of extracting an EV-specificbiomarker signal from a complex biological background.DOI: 10.1186/s40169-018-0192-7 PMCID: PMC5981152PMID: 29855735
