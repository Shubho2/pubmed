In this study we investigated how effective on killing MM cells by carbonion beam alone or in combination with cisplatin (CDDP) in vitro. Carbon ion beam (at the center of SOBP with 50 keV/µm of average LET) dose-independentlysuppressed MM cells MESO-1 and H226 cell viability and in combination with CDDP(25 μM) significantly enhanced its action. Relative biological effectiveness(RBE) values at 73 keV/μm and 13 keV/μm portion of carbon ion beam was estimated as 2.82-2.93 and 1.19-1.22 at D10 level relative to X-ray, respectively by using colony formation assay. Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed thatexpression of apoptosis-related BAX and autophagy-related Beclin1 and ATG7 wassignificantly enhanced by carbon ion beam alone or in combination with CDDP.Apoptosis analysis showed that caspase 3/7 activity and the percentage ofapoptotic cells was dose-dependently increased after carbon ion beam and it wasfurther increased when combined with CDDP. Spheroid formation ability of cancerstem like CD44+/CD26+ cells was significantly inhibited by carbon ion beamcombined with CDDP. Besides, carbon ion beam combined with cisplatinsignificantly inhibited cell cycle progression (sub-G1 arrest) and induced morelarge number of γH2AX foci. In conclusion, carbon ion beam combined with CDDP hassuperior potential to kill MM cells including CSCs with enhanced apoptosis.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23756 PMCID: PMC5871082PMID: 29599911
