[Epubahead of print]Is specialized palliative cancer care associated with use of antineoplastictreatment at the end of life? A population-based cohort study.Skov Benthien K(1)(2), Adsersen M(3), Petersen MA(3), Soelberg Vadstrup E(2),Sjøgren P(2), Groenvold M(3)(4).Author information: (1)1 Center for Clinical Research and Prevention, Frederiksberg Hospital,Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.(2)2 Department of Oncology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital,Copenhagen, Denmark.(3)3 The Research Unit, Department of Palliative Medicine, Bispebjerg Hospital,Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.(4)4 Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.BACKGROUND: The use of chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life should be as low as possible.AIM: To study the factors related to the use of chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life and the factors related to concurrent antineoplastic treatment andspecialized palliative care.DESIGN: This was a population-based cohort study. The data were collected fromthe Danish Register of Causes of Death, the Danish National Patient Register, andthe Danish Palliative Care Database. Analyses were descriptive and multivariatelogistic regression.SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Cancer decedents between 2010 and 2013 in the CapitalRegion of Denmark.RESULTS: During the study period, 17,246 individuals died of cancer and 33%received specialized palliative care. In the last 14 days of life, 4.2% received chemotherapy. Younger patients and patients with hematological cancers were more likely to receive chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life. Receiving specializedpalliative care was associated with a lower risk of receiving chemotherapy in thelast 14 days of life-odds ratio 0.15 for hospices and 0.53 for palliativehospital units. A total of 8% of the population received concurrentantineoplastic treatment and specialized palliative care. Female gender, younger age, and breast and prostate cancer were significantly associated with thisconcurrent model.CONCLUSION: Overall, the incidence of antineoplastic treatment in the last14 days of life was low compared to other studies. Patients in specializedpalliative care had a reduced risk of receiving chemotherapy at the end of life.DOI: 10.1177/0269216318786393 PMID: 30004303
