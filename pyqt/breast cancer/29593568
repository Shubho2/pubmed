EMT can be induced by certain factors, notably hypoxia, in the tumormicroenvironment. Aberrant levels of certain N-glycans is associated with cancer progression. We used an integrated strategy (mass spectrometry in combinationwith lectin microarray analysis) to elucidate aberrant glycosylation in ahypoxia-induced EMT model using breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. Themodel showed reduced levels of bisecting GlcNAc structures, and downregulatedexpression of the corresponding glycosyltransferase MGAT3. MGAT3 overexpressionin MCF7 suppressed cell migration, proliferation, colony formation, expression ofEMT markers, and AKT signaling pathway, whereas MGAT3 knockdown (shRNA silencing)had opposite effects. Our findings clearly demonstrate the functional role (andeffects of dysregulation) of bisecting GlcNAc structures in hypoxia-induced EMT, and provide a useful basis for further detailed studies of physiologicalfunctions of these structures in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2018.00210 PMCID: PMC5854678PMID: 29593568
