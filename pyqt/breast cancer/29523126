The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MYCamplification and associated markers in BCa tumors from African American (AA)women and determine the associations between MYC amplification andclinico-pathological characteristics.METHODS: We analyzed 70 cases of well characterized archival breast ductalcarcinoma specimens from AA women for MYC oncogene amplification. Utilizingimmune histochemical analysis estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR),and (HER2/neu), were assessed. Cases were Luminal A (ER or PR+, Ki-67 < 14%),Luminal B (ER or PR+, Ki-67 = > 14% or ER or PR+ HER2+), HER2 (ER-, PR-, HER2+), and Triple Negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-) with basal-like phenotype. The relationshipbetween MYC amplification and prognostic clinico-pathological characteristics wasdetermined using chi square and logistic regression modeling.RESULTS: Sixty-five (97%) of the tumors showed MYC gene amplification (MYC:CEP8 > 1). Statistically significant associations were found between MYCamplification and HER2-amplified BCa, and Luminal B subtypes of BCa (p < 0.0001),stage (p < 0.001), metastasis (p < 0.001), and positive lymph node status(p = 0.039). MYC amplification was associated with HER2 status (p = 0.01) andtumor size (p = 0.01). High MYC amplification was seen in grade III carcinomas(MYC: CEP8 = 2.42), pre-menopausal women (MYC: CEP8 = 2.49), PR-negative status(MYC: CEP8 = 2.42), and ER-positive status (MYC: CEP8 = 2.4).CONCLUSIONS: HER2 positive BCas in AA women are likely to exhibit MYCamplification. High amplification ratios suggest that MYC drives HER2amplification, especially in HER2 positive, Luminal B, and subtypes of BCa.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4171-6 PMCID: PMC5845301PMID: 29523126
