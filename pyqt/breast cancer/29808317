We propose here a novel mechanism of the tumor suppresser, TIS21/BTG2,that inhibits both growth and invasion of triple negative breast cancer cells viaAKT1 activation by differential regulation of mTORc1 and mTORc2 activity.METHODS: Transduction of adenovirus carrying TIS21/BTG2 gene and transfection of short interfering RNAs were employed to regulate TIS21/BTG2 gene expression invarious cell lines. Treatment of mTOR inhibitors and mTOR kinase assays canevaluate the role of mTORc in the regulation of AKT phosphorylation at S473residue by TIS21/BTG2 in breast cancer cells. Open data and immunohistochemicalanalysis were performed to confirm the role of TIS21/BTG2 expression in varioushuman breast cancer tissues.RESULTS: We observed that TIS21/BTG2 inhibited mTORc1 activity by reducingRaptor-mTOR interaction along with upregulation of tsc1 expression, which lead tosignificant reduction of p70S6K activation as opposed to AKT1S473, but not AKT2, phosphorylation via downregulating PHLPP2 (AKT1-specific phosphatase) in breastcancers. TIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 required Rictor-bound mTOR kinase,indicating activation of mTORc2 by TIS21/BTG2 gene. Additionally, theTIS21/BTG2-induced pAKTS473 could reduce expression of NFAT1 (nuclear factor ofactivated T cells) and its target genes, which regulate cancer microenvironment.CONCLUSIONS: TIS21/BTG2 significantly lost in the infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but it can inhibit cancer growth via the TIS21/BTG2-tsc1/2-mTORc1-p70S6K axis anddownregulate cancer progression via the TIS21/BTG2-mTORc2-AKT1-NFAT1-PHLPP2pathway.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2677-6 PMID: 29808317  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
