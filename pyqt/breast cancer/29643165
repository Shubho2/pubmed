Overall, the probability of reoperationdecreased slightly over time. However, there were divergent patterns byreoperation type; the probability of re-excision increased alongside aconcomitant decrease in the probability of mastectomy. Significantbetween-hospital variation was observed. Non-metropolitan location and surgery atlow-volume hospitals were associated with a higher overall probability ofreoperation, and of mastectomy specifically, after accounting for patient-levelfactors, calendar year and area-level socioeconomic status. The magnitude ofassociation with geographical location and surgical volume decreased over time.CONCLUSIONS: Reoperation rates within 90 days of BCS varied significantly betweenhospitals. For women undergoing mastectomy after BCS, this represents a dramatic change in clinical course. Multilevel modelling suggests unwarranted clinicalvariation may be an issue, likely due to disparities in access tomultidisciplinary breast cancer care and preoperative diagnostic procedures.However, the observed reduction in disparities over time is encouraging andindicates that guidelines and policy initiatives have the potential to improveregional breast cancer care.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
