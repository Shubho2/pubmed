In this study, we report luminescentiridium(iii) complexes (11-14) as intracellular dopamine receptor (D1R/D2R) cell imaging agents. Complexes 11 and 13, which are conjugated with a dopaminereceptor agonist, showed superior cell imaging characteristics, high stabilityand low cytotoxicity (>100 Î¼M) in A549 lung cancer cells. siRNA knockdown anddopamine competitive assays indicated that complexes 11 and 13 could selectively bind to dopamine receptors (D1R/D2R) in A549 cells. Fluorescence lifetimemicroscopy demonstrated that complex 13 has a longer luminescence lifetime at thewavelength of 560-650 nm than DAPI and other chromophores in biological fluids.The long luminescence lifetime of complex 13 not only provides an opportunity forefficient dopamine receptor tracking in biological media, but also enables thetemporal separation of the probe signal from the intense background signal byfluorescence lifetime microscopy for efficient analysis. Complex 13 also showshigh photostability, which could allow it to be employed for long-term cellularimaging. Furthermore, complex 13 could selectively track the internalizationprocess of dopamine receptors (D1R/D2R) in living cells. To the best of ourknowledge, complex 13 is the first metal-based compound that has been used tomonitor intracellular dopamine receptors in living cells.DOI: 10.1039/c7sc04798c PMCID: PMC5885777PMID: 29675156
