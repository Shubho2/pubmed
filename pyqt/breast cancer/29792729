Attenuation and noise of thepulmonary trunk were measured to calculate contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR). Three radiologists assessed the presence of central and segmental PE and diagnosticconfidence. Interobserver agreement was calculated using intraclass correlationcoefficient (ICC). Radiation exposure was assessed as effective dose (ED).RESULTS: Pulmonary trunk CNR values were significantly increased in 90-kVpcompared to linearly-blended series (15.4 ± 6.3 vs 11.3 ± 4.6, p < 0.001).Diagnostic accuracy for PE assessment was similar in both series with excellentinterobserver agreement (p = 0.48; ICC, 0.83; p = 0.48). Overall confidence forPE assessment was rated excellent for both series with a significant advantagefor linearly-blended series (p < 0.001; 4.1 vs 3.8). ED was reduced by 37.2% with90-kVp compared to 120-kVp equivalent image series (1.1 ± 0.6 vs 1.7 ± 0.7 mSv, p< 0.001).CONCLUSION: 90-kVp CTPA with Admire provided increased quantitative image qualitywith similar diagnostic accuracy and confidence for PE assessment compared to120-kVp equivalent acquisition, while radiation dose was reduced by 37.2%.Advances in knowledge: 90-kVp CTPA with an advanced iterative reconstructionalgorithm results in excellent image quality and reduction of radiation exposure without limiting diagnostic performance.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20180269 PMID: 29792729  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
