These cancers represent a unique therapeutic challenge because of abidirectional cross-talk between the estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±) and HER2pathways leading to tumor progression and resistance to targeted therapy.Attempts to combine standard of care HER2-targeted drugs with antihormonal agentsfor the treatment of HR+/HER2+ breast cancer yielded encouraging results inpreclinical experiments but did improve overall survival in clinical trial. Inthis review, we dissect multiple mechanisms of therapeutic resistance typical of HR+/HER2+ breast cancer, summarize prior clinical trials of targeted agents, and describe novel rational drug combinations that include antihormonal agents,HER2-targeted drugs, and CDK4/6 inhibitors for treatment of the HR+/HER2+ breast cancer subtype.DOI: 10.1155/2018/7835095 PMCID: PMC6029445PMID: 30018827
