The aim of this study was tosystematically evaluate improvements in side effects and quality of lifeassociated with a hospital-based integrative medicine program in the modernbreast cancer patient care setting.METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, integrative health counseling and treatment were evaluated in women with breast cancer. Over a 15-month period, data for 75patients from an integrative medicine consultancy service with standardizedoperating procedures were collected at the University Breast Center forFranconia. At baseline, the patients answered a questionnaire on their medicalhistory, symptoms, and the treatment goals they were hoping to achieve withintegrative medicine. In the follow-up, patient-reported outcomes related to sideeffects of conventional cancer treatment and patients' quality of life wereanalyzed.RESULTS: Among 60 patients with the therapy goal of reducing the side effects of conventional treatment, 46 (76.7%) were successful. Among 57 patients hoping toimprove disease-related quality of life, 46 (82%) reported success. Whereaspatients with metastatic disease achieved a reduction in the side effects ofconventional therapy, quality-of-life improvements were predominantly achieved bypatients with a good treatment prognosis.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients benefit from the counseling and treatmentprovided with integrative medicine in all phases of tumor disease. Integrativetreatment services should be included as part of patient care in clinical routinework to offer patients the maximum quality of care and safety with complementary therapies.DOI: 10.1177/1534735418777883 PMID: 29845888
