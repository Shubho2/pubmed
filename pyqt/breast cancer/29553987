Unfortunately, generalconsensus is lacking as to how best reduce the risk of developing CPSP.RECENT FINDINGS: Cancer is now not always a short-lived, fatal disease and is nowmoving towards a chronic illness. Poorly managed perioperative pain is thegreatest risk factor for CPSP. Recent trials have examined preventive strategies for CPSP associated with breast surgery and thoracotomy, two operations used incancer treatment. Standard antinociceptive drugs, 5% lidocaine patches andketamine do not prevent CPSP. The evidence for gabapentinoids is conflicting.Intravenous lidocaine and, separately, regional anaesthesia appear beneficial.SUMMARY: Well-managed pain, irrespective of technique, reduces the risk of CPSP. The literature is inconclusive regarding an 'optimal approach.' Regionalanaesthesia, intravenous lidocaine and the aggressive management of perioperativepain using multimodal analgesia including antineuropathic pain agents such asgabapentinoids and certain antidepressants are recommended. Clinicians should notrely on general anaesthesia, opioids, NSAIDs and ketamine to prevent CPSP. Ablanket approach using gabapentinoids for all patients undergoing major surgeryis not indicated. Instead, the presence of perioperative neuropathic pain should be checked for regularly.DOI: 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000341 PMID: 29553987
