Epub2017 Oct 30.Tumor microenvironment heterogeneity: challenges and opportunities.Runa F(1), Hamalian S(1), Meade K(1), Shisgal P(1), Gray PC(2), Kelber JA(1).Author information: (1)Department of Biology, California State University, Northridge, CA.(2)The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA.The tumor microenvironment (TME) has been recognized as an integral component of malignancies in breast and prostate tissues, contributing in confounding ways to tumor progression, metastasis, therapy resistance and disease recurrence. Majorcomponents of the TME are immune cells, fibroblasts, pericytes, endothelialcells, mesenchymal stroma/stem cells (MSCs), and extracellular matrix (ECM)components. Herein, we discuss the molecular and cellular heterogeneity withinthe TME and how this presents unique challenges and opportunities for treatingbreast and prostate cancers.DOI: 10.1007/s40610-017-0073-7 PMCID: PMC5802345 [Available on 2018-12-01]PMID: 29430386
