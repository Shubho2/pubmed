[Epub ahead of print]Albumin coated cadmium nanoparticles as chemotherapeutic agent against MDA-MB 231human breast cancer cell line.Azizi M(1), Ghourchian H(1)(2), Yazdian F(3), Alizadehzeinabad H(1).Author information: (1)a Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics (IBB) , University of Tehran ,Tehran , Iran.(2)b Nanobiomedicine Center of Excellence, Nanoscience and NanotechnologyResearch Center , University of Tehran , Tehran , Iran.(3)c Biological Sciences, Faculty of New Science and Technology , University ofTehran , Tehran , Iran.With the aim of dedicating toxicity of cadmium nanoparticles (CdNPs) againstinvasive breast cancer, with minimum damage to surrounding healthy cells, CdNPswere coated with albumin nanocarrier by nanoprecipitation method and namedCdNPs@BSA. The characterization was done by TEM image, DLS and UV-Vis,fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy. The cytotoxic efficacy of theCdNPs@BSA against human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB 231 cells) was examined byMTT assay. Apoptosis, as the mechanism of cell death, was verified by invertedmicroscopy, fluorescent microscopy, gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry. Therole of ROS generation in apoptosis was also studied. It was found that theresulted CdNPs@BSA (diameter of 88 nm and zeta potential of about -18.85 mV) was suitable for penetration in tumour micro vessels. In the form of CdNPs@BSA, the77% of the secondary structure and almost all of the tertiary structure remainintact. Comparing to CdNPs, CdNPs@BSA could significantly suppress the MDA-MB 231while they were less toxic on WBCs. Therefore, they could be a brilliantcandidate to be used as a chemotherapeutic agent against invasive breast cancercells.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1436064 PMID: 29426245
