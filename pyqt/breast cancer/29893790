Pre-clinical data suggests palbociclibmay partially reverse endocrine resistance, though this hypothesis has not beenevaluated in previous clinical studies. This phase II, open-label, multi-centerstudy examined the activity of palbociclib monotherapy, as well as palbociclibgiven in combination with the same endocrine therapy (ET) that was received priorto disease progression, in post-menopausal women with moderately pre-treated,estrogen receptor-positive, HER2 negative advanced breast cancer.Patients and Methods: Eligible women with advanced disease which had progressedon one or two prior ETs were randomized 1:1 to receive either palbociclib alone, or palbociclib in combination with the ET as previously received. Primaryendpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR); secondary endpoints includedprogression-free survival (PFS).Results: Between October 2012 and July 2016, a total of 115 patients wererandomized. The CBR was 54% (95% CI 41.5 - 63.7) for combination therapy, and 60%(95% CI 47.8 - 72.9) for monotherapy. Median PFS was 10.8 months (95% CI 5.6 -12.7) for combination therapy, and 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 8.5) formonotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69; 95% CI 0.4 - 1.1, exploratory P-value =0.12). Exploratory analyses revealed the PFS advantage for combination therapywas seen in the subgroup of patients who received prior ET for >6 months (HR0.53; 95% CI 0.3 - 0.9, exploratory P-value = 0.02), but not in those whoreceived prior ET for â‰¤6 months.Conclusion: Palbociclib has clinical activity as a single agent in women withmoderately pre-treated, oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advancedbreast cancer. Palbociclib may have potential to reverse endocrine resistance in patients with a history of previous durable response to ET.Clinical trial information: NCT02549430.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy214 PMID: 29893790
