The cells were randomly allocated to 19 groups: onenegative control, three positive controls and 15 treatment groups. MCF-7 cellswere treated with three concentrations of CC NPs (50, 100 and 150 μg/mL), gammaradiation (200 cGy), hyperthermia (41 °C for 1 h) and three concentrations ofdoxorubicin (200, 400 and 800 nm) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Then the cell viability, the percentage of apoptosis and the levels of caspase-3, -8 and -9proteins were measured. The results indicated that the combination group(150 µg/mL CC NPs + thermoradiotherapy) had a significant (p < .001) decrease in cell viability (48.65 ± 4.8%) and a significant (p < .001) increase in apoptosis percentage (45 ± 1.63%) of MCF-7 cells, as compared with the negative control andmost of the other treatment groups. Moreover, a significant (p < .05) increasewas observed in the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Our findings revealedthat CC NPs in combination with irradiation and hyperthermia could significantly reduce the cell viability and enhance the apoptosis of the MCF-7 breast cancercells, the same as doxorubicin anti-cancer drug.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1457537 PMID: 29616844
