It is believed that therapeutic targeting of HER3 is requiredto improve patient outcomes. It is not clear whether a novel strategy with twofunctional cooperative miRNAs would effectively inhibit erbB3 expression andpotentiate the anti-proliferative/anti-survival effects of a HER2-targetedtherapy (trastuzumab) and chemotherapy (paclitaxel) on HER2-overexpressing breastcancer cells.Results: Combination of miR-125a and miR-205, as compared to either miRNA alone, potently inhibited expression of HER3 in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer BT474 cells. Co-expression of the two miRNAs not only reduced the levels ofphosphorylated erbB3 (P-erbB3), Akt (P-Akt), and Src (P-Src), it also inhibitedcell proliferation and increased cells at G1 phase. A multi-miRNA lentiviralvector - the cluster of miR-125a and miR-205 - was constructed to simultaneously express the two miRNAs in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Concurrentexpression of miR-125a and miR-205 via the miRNA cluster transfectionsignificantly enhanced trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition and cell cycle G1arrest in BT474 cells and markedly increased paclitaxel-induced apoptosis inanother HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell line HCC1954.Conclusions: Here, we showed that functional cooperative miRNAs effectivelysuppressed erbB3 expression. This novel approach targeting of HER3 was able toenhance the therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab and paclitaxel againstHER2-overexpressing breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12575-018-0081-x PMCID: PMC6081814PMID: 30093840
