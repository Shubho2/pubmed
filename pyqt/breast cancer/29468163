In 2014, in Portugal approximately 27,200 people died of cancer, of which 1,791 were women with breast cancer. Flaxseed has beenone of the most studied foods, regarding possible relations to breast cancer,though mainly in experimental studies in animals, yet in few clinical trials. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, α-linolenic acid, lignan, and fibers. One of the main components of flaxseed is the lignans, of which 95% are made of thepredominant secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). SDG is converted intoenterolactone and enterodiol, both with antiestrogen activity and structurallysimilar to estrogen; they can bind to cell receptors, decreasing cell growth.Some studies have shown that the intake of omega-3 fatty acids is related to the reduction of breast cancer risk. In animal studies, α-linolenic acids have beenshown to be able to suppress growth, size, and proliferation of cancer cells and also to promote breast cancer cell death. Other animal studies found that theintake of flaxseed combined with tamoxifen can reduce tumor size to a greaterextent than taking tamoxifen alone. Additionally, some clinical trials showedthat flaxseed can have an important role in decreasing breast cancer risk, mainlyin postmenopausal women. Further studies are needed, specifically clinical trialsthat may demonstrate the potential benefits of flaxseed in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fnut.2018.00004 PMCID: PMC5808339PMID: 29468163
