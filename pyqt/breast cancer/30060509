There are significant limitations to the current diagnostic regimens and no established effective screening modality. To this end, research has discoveredhundreds of potential 'biomarkers' that may one day be of use in screening,diagnosis or prognostication. However, the barriers to bringing biomarkers toclinical evaluation and eventually into clinical usage have yet to be realised.This is an operational challenge that requires some new thinking and development of paradigms to increase the efficiency of the laboratory process and add 'value'to the clinician. Value comes in various forms, whether it be a process that isseamlessly integrated into the hospital laboratory environment or one that canprovide additional 'information' for the clinical pathologist in terms of riskprofiling. We describe, herein, an efficient and tissue-conserving pipeline that uses Tissue Microarrays in a semi-automated process that could, one day, beintegrated into the hospital laboratory domain, using seven putative prostatecancer biomarkers for illustration.DOI: 10.3390/diagnostics8030049 PMID: 30060509
