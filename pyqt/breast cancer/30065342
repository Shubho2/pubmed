The aim of this study was to investigate theprevalence of PMPS and the risk factors in women submitted to surgical treatment for breast cancer. The study included 532 postoperative breast cancer patients ina hospital for five consecutive years period, of whom 473 were consideredeligible and included in the study. A total of 420 people completed aquestionnaire survey, which revealed that 152 (36.2%) had ever suffered from PMPSand 18 (11.8%) sought treatment. Of the patients with PMPS, 34 (22.4%) had ahistory of chronic pain. Patients with PMPS were younger than patients withoutPMPS (50.5 ± 10.4 vs 53.5 ± 11.1). Univariate analysis showed that age, historyof chronic pain, tumor staging, number of lymphadenectomy were significantlydifferent between the two groups. Multivariate analysis shows that age andhistory of chronic pain were independent risk factors. The incidence of PMPS inpostoperative breast cancer patients can reach 36.2%, and age as well as previoushistory of pain are independent risk factors for PMPS. The combination ofprevention and treatment may be an effective way to reduce PMPS.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29946-x PMCID: PMC6068100PMID: 30065342
