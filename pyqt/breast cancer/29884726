Epub 2018Jun 8.An Immunosuppressive Role for Eya3 in TNBC.[No authors listed]A recent study indicates that the protein Eya3 influences the adaptive immuneresponse to promote tumor growth, not only decreasing the number oftumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, but also driving their exhaustion through PD-L1 upregulation. These findings could spur new strategies to treat triple-negativebreast cancer, which currently lacks targeted therapies.Â©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-NB2018-072 PMID: 29884726
