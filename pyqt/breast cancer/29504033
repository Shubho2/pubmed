This study compares thecomplications of the two coverage methods.METHODS: We reviewed, retrospectively, 106 cases of immediate TE-based breastreconstruction. The patients were divided into two groups according to whethercomplete or partial TE coverage was done. In the complete coverage group, theserratus anterior MF flap was dissected and sutured to the pectoralis majormuscle to cover the TE completely. In the partial coverage group, the serratusanterior MF flap was not dissected, and the lateral border of the pectoralismajor muscle was sutured to the mastectomy skin flaps.RESULTS: The TEs were covered completely in 60 breasts and partially in 46breasts. The mastectomy flap necrosis rate was significantly higher in thecomplete coverage group (p < 0.01), but there was no incidence of TE exposure in either groups. The lateral migration rate was significantly higher in the partialcoverage group (p = 0.033). There were no significant differences in the cranial migration rate (p = 0.133).CONCLUSIONS: The complete coverage method is a better option if there is a highrisk of mastectomy flap necrosis; however, surgeons should monitor carefully for cranial migration.DOI: 10.1007/s00595-018-1645-8 PMID: 29504033  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
