Low DDR1 expression is associated with worse relapse-free survival,reflecting its controversial role in cancer progression. We detected DDR1 onluminal cells but not on myoepithelial cells of DDR1+/+ mice. We found that DDR1 loss compromises cell adhesion, consistent with data that older DDR1-/- mammaryglands had more basal/myoepithelial cells. Basal cells isolated from older miceexerted higher traction forces than the luminal cells, in agreement withincreased mammary branches observed in older DDR1-/- mice and higher branching bytheir isolated organoids. When we crossed DDR1-/- mice with MMTV-PyMT mice, thePyMT/DDR1-/- mammary tumors grew faster and had increased epithelial tension and matricellular fibrosis with a more basal phenotype and increased lung metastases.DDR1 deletion induced basal differentiation of CD90+CD24+ cancer cells, and theincrease in basal cells correlated with tumor cell mitoses. K14+ basal cells,including K8+K14+ cells, were increased adjacent to necrotic fields. These datasuggest that the absence of DDR1 provides a growth and adhesion advantage thatfavors the expansion of basal cells, potentiates fibrosis, and enhancesnecrosis/hypoxia and basal differentiation of transformed cells to increase theiraggression and metastatic potential.Â© 2018 Takai et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.DOI: 10.1101/gad.301366.117 PMCID: PMC5859966PMID: 29483153  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
