R. China. anderson-qian@163.com.Micellar nanoparticles have unique advantages as carriers for therapeutic orimaging agents, owing to their smaller size and better penetration of tumors.However, some agents, due to their physical or chemical properties, are difficultto load into micelles. IR780 is one of these agents, and is also a promisingnear-infrared dye for fluorescence imaging (FI)/photoacoustic imaging (PAI) andcancer photothermal therapy (PTT). Its hydrophobic and high crystallizationstructure results in limited bioavailability in vivo. It is difficult to loadinto micelles constructed from an amphiphilic block polymer with relatively lowmolecular weight. In this study, we use computer simulation and introduce anothersmall biomolecule, α-lipoic acid, into the micelles constructed from a mPEG-PCLcopolymer, to lower the energy of molecular interaction between MPEG-PCL andIR780, and expect to enhance the loading capacity of the micelles to IR780. Theintroduction of α-lipoic acid decreases the energy of molecular interactionbetween MEPG-PCL and IR780 from -46.18 kJ mol-1 to -196.52 kJ mol-1 and increasesthe loading capacity and stability of the mPEG-PCL micelles to IR780, which also maintains the loading capacity to DTX. We further construct DTX/IR780 co-loadedmPEG-PCL micelles for FI/PAI dual modal imaging guided PTT/chemotherapy ofcancer. By FI and PAI evaluation in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrate that theDTX/IR780 co-loaded micelles can be used as FI and PAI probes. By furtherevaluating the therapeutic outcome of PTT/chemotherapy co-therapy of breastcancer, we demonstrate that the DTX/IR780 co-loaded mPEG-PCL micelles can serveas promising candidates for FI and PAI guided PTT/chemotherapy of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1039/c8bm00096d PMID: 29578215
