Toenhance treatment efficiency it is essential to implement an individual-basedtreatment. The aim of present study was to identify the mechanism of intrinsicapoptosis pathway on radiosensitivity and normal tissue complications caused bythe radiotherapy.Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ten breast cancer patients were exposed to 6MV X-rays to deliver 1 and 2 Gy. Expression levels ofBax, Bcl-2, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were examined by relative quantitative RT-PCR.All the patients received similar tangential irradiation of the whole breast and conventional fractionation. Skin dosimetry was done by GAFChromic EBT-3 film and clinical radiosensitivity was determined using the acute reactions toradiotherapy of the skin according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group score. Allstatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, version 7.01.Results: In the in-vitro experiment, Bax and Bax/Bcl-2 ratios were significantly increased with 1 and 2 Gy doses (P<0.001 and P<0.0001, respectively). Herein, thenotable result was a significant correlation between dose-response curve slope(as an in-vitro radiosensitivity index) and acute skin toxicity score followingirradiation (as a clinical radiosensitivity index). There was no significantrelationship between skin dose and reactions (P>0.05 for all patients).Conclusion: Significant correlation between Bax/Bcl-2 ratio determined beforeradiation therapy and clinical response in the patients, can be used as abiomarker to identify radiosensitive individuals. However, further studies arerequired to validate radiation-induced apoptotic biomarkers.DOI: 10.22038/IJBMS.2018.26179.6429 PMCID: PMC5817177PMID: 29511500
