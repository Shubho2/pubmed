However, there is still no consensus on the best tool to evaluate pathological response to NAC.METHODS: Two reviewers systematically searched Cochrane, PubMed, EMBASE, Web ofScience, and CBM (last updated in February 2017) for eligible articles. Weindependently screened and selected studies that conformed to the inclusioncriteria and extracted the requisite data. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, andthe area under the SROC curve were calculated to estimate the diagnostic accuracyof magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission computed tomography(PET/CT). And the relative DOR (RDOR) was used to compare accuracy for levels of the covariable.RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 575 patients who underwent MRI and 618 whounderwent PET/CT were included in our analysis. The pooled sensitivity andspecificity of MRI were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.78-0.94) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.51-0.83),respectively. The corresponding values for PET/CT were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.58-0.90)and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.63-0.88), respectively. The area under the SROC curve for MRIand PET/CT were 0.88 and 0.84, respectively. And the RDOR = 1.44 (95% CI,0.46-4.47 P = 0.83).CONCLUSION: MRI had a higher sensitivity and PET/CT had a higher specificity inpredicting the pathologic response after NAC in patients with breast cancer.According to the area under the SROC curve and anatomic discriminativeresolution, MRI is the more suitable recommendation for predicting the pathologicresponse after NAC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
