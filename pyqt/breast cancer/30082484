[Epub ahead of print]Suppression of Breast Cancer Stem Cells and Tumor Growth by the RUNX1Transcription Factor.Hong D(1), Fritz AJ(1), Finstad KH(1), Fitzgerald MP(2), Weinheimer A(1), ViensAL(1), Ramsey J(1), Stein JL(2), Lian JB(2), Stein GS(3).Author information: (1)College of Medicine, Biochemistry, University of Vermont.(2)Biochemistry, University of Vermont College of Medicine.(3)Biochemistry, University of Vermont College of Medicine gary.stein@uvm.edu.Breast cancer remains the most common malignant disease in women worldwide.Despite advances in detection and therapies, studies are still needed tounderstand the mechanisms underlying this cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSC) play animportant role in tumor formation, growth, drug-resistance and recurrence. Here, it is demonstrated that the transcription factor RUNX1, well known as essentialfor hematopoietic differentiation, represses the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)phenotype and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. The present studies show thatBCSCs sorted from pre-malignant breast cancer cells exhibit decreased RUNX1levels, while ectopic expression of RUNX1 suppresses tumorsphere formation andreduces the BCSC population. RUNX1 ectopic expression in breast cancer cellsreduces migration, invasion and in vivo tumor growth (57%) in mouse mammary fatpad. Mechanistically, RUNX1 functions to suppress breast cancer tumor growththrough repression of cancer stem cell activity and direct inhibition of Zeb1expression. Consistent with these cellular and biochemical results, clinicalfindings using patient specimens reveal that the highest RUNX1 levels occur innormal mammary epithelial cells and that low RUNX1 expression in tumors isassociated with poor patient survival.IMPLICATIONS: The key finding that RUNX1represses stemness in several breast cancer cell lines points to the importanceof RUNX1 in other solid tumors where RUNX1 may regulate cancer stem cellsproperties.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0135 PMID: 30082484
