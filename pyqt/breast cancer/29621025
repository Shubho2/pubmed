However, previous studieshave rarely used qualitative methods to explore the postoperative experiences andfeelings of patients with breast cancer.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the reasons underlyingpostoperative sexual relationship changes, sexual inactivity, and adaptation tosexual life in patients with breast cancer, as well as interventions provided by medical staff.INTERVENTIONS/STUDY METHODS: A survey was performed by using electronic databasesand electronic journals accessed through the Internet. The following keywordswere used: "breast cancer," "sexual problem," "sexual dysfunction," and"qualitative."RESULTS: Seven articles were included in the literature review. Three maindomains were explored, namely, reasons for sexual relationship changes, includingage and treatment; the way patients used to adapt to sexual life after thediagnosis of breast cancer, including support systems, communication withpartner, and religious beliefs; and intervention by healthcare workers, includingintimacy enhancement measures and patient-provider communication.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study can facilitate and encourage healthprofessionals to identify, examine, and solve most of the patient's sexualproblems by using the functional and medical framework of the healthcare system.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: One practical recommendation of this study is theincorporation of sexual counseling units into the national healthcare system.Counselors in these units can aid patients with breast cancer in resolving their sexual issues and promoting sexual satisfaction in the husbands (or partners) of the patients.DOI: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000592 PMID: 29621025
