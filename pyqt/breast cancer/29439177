Widespread use ofCSFs that is not guideline-concordant has been reported. Among patients withbreast cancer receiving chemotherapy, the ability of evidence-based decisionsupport tools to promote risk-appropriate reductions in CSF use without increasedincidence of FN has not been examined. Methods: A retrospective cohort design andUS commercial claims data were used. The impact of CSF decision support wasanalyzed among women with breast cancer receiving first-cycle chemotherapy fromApril 1, 2013, to March 30, 2015. The tool was implemented as part of a priorauthorization process in 9 states starting July 1, 2014. Patients were assignedto intervention (ie, states where the decision support tool had been implemented)or nonintervention states (ie, 39 states where the tool had not beenimplemented). CSF use and subsequent incidence of FN were compared usingdifference-in-difference (DID) regressions adjusting for baseline differences in FN risk factors such as comorbidities and various infections. Results: The study sample of 7,224 patients (intervention states: pre-implementation, 1,991 andpost-implementation, 2,010; nonintervention states: pre-implementation, 1,569 andpost-implementation, 1,654) showed no significant difference in risk factors.Before and after implementation, a significant decrease in the proportion ofpatients with CSF use was observed in the intervention states (75% to 69%)compared with no significant change in the nonintervention (72% to 71%) states(DID, -5.4%; 95% CI, -6.0% to -4.7%; P=.006). No significance increase in FNincidence occurred in intervention (5.0% to 5.5%) and nonintervention (5.4% to4.8%) states (DID, 0.2%; 95% CI, -0.20 to 0.30; P=.78). Similar results wereobtained in subgroups by comorbidities and in sensitivity analyses byclaims-based FN definitions. Conclusions: CSF use decreased modestly afterimplementation of the decision support tool, with no observed changes in FNrates. Such tools can reduce practice variation to improve care standards.Copyright Â© 2018 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.DOI: 10.6004/jnccn.2017.7033 PMID: 29439177
