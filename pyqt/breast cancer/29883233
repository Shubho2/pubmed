[Epubahead of print]The effects of fractional microablative CO2 laser therapy on sexual function inpostmenopausal women and women with a history of breast cancer treated withendocrine therapy.Gittens P(1), Mullen G(2).Author information: (1)a Philadelphia Center for Sexual Medicine , Philadelphia, PA , USA.(2)b Drexel University College of Medicine , Philadelphia, PA , USA.PURPOSE: To examine the outcomes of sexual function in postmenopausal women andwomen with a history of breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy who wereexperiencing the symptoms of GSM for which they were treated with fractionalmicroablative CO2 laser.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 2015 to October 2016, a retrospective chartreview of women who underwent fractional microablative CO2 laser therapy(MonaLisa Touch, DEKA) for GSM was conducted. Several validated questionnaireswere used to assess changes in symptoms and sexual function including the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Wong-Baker Faces Scale (WBFS), and the FemaleSexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDSR). Comparisons of mean symptom scores weredescribed at baseline and six weeks after each treatment.RESULTS: There was a statistically significant improvement in every domain ofFSFI, WBFS, and FSDS-R when comparing baseline symptom scores to after treatment three symptom scores for all patients. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the differences, if any, in outcomes of sexual function between postmenopausal women and women with a history of breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy. Bothgroups had statistically significant improvements in many domains studied.CONCLUSIONS: Fractional microablative CO2 laser therapy (MonaLisa Touch, DEKA) isan effective modality in treating the symptoms of GSM in postmenopausal women andwomen with a history of breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy.DOI: 10.1080/14764172.2018.1481510 PMID: 29883233
