Hippo component YAP has been widely reported to be involved in manyaspects of tumour biology. However, its role in focal adhesion regulation inbreast cancer remains unexplored.METHODS: Tissue microarray was used to evaluate YAP expression in clinical breastcancer specimens by immunohistochemical staining. Cell migration and invasionabilities were measured by Transwell assay. A cell adhesion assay was used tomeasure the ability of cell adhesion to gelatin. The focal adhesion wasvisualized through immunofluorescence. Phosphorylated FAK and other proteins weredetected by Western blot analysis. Gene expression profiling was used to screendifferently expressed genes, and gene ontology enrichment was performed usingDAVID software. The gene mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR.The activity of the THBS1-promoter was evaluated by dual luciferase assay.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to verify whether YAP could bind tothe THBS1-promoter region. The prediction of potential protein-interaction wasperformed with the String program. The ChIP sequence data of TEAD was obtainedfrom the ENCODE database and analysed via the ChIP-seek tool. The gene expressiondataset (GSE30480) of purified tumour cells from primary breast tumour tissuesand metastatic lymph nodes was used in the gene set enrichment analysis.Prognostic analysis of the TCGA dataset was performed by the SurvExpress program.Gene expression correlation of the TCGA dataset was analysed via R2: GenomicsAnalysis and Visualization Platform.RESULTS: Our study provides evidence that YAP acts as a promoter of focaladhesion and tumour invasiveness via regulating FAK phosphorylation in breastcancer. Further experiments reveal that YAP could induce FAK phosphorylationthrough a TEAD-dependent manner. Using gene expression profiling andbioinformatics analysis, we identify the FAK upstream gene, thrombospondin 1, as a direct transcriptional target of YAP-TEAD. Silencing THBS1 could reverse theYAP-induced FAK activation and focal adhesion.CONCLUSION: Our results unveil a new signal axis, YAP/THBS1/FAK, in themodulation of cell adhesion and invasiveness, and provides new insights into the crosstalk between Hippo signalling and focal adhesion.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0850-z PMCID: PMC6064138PMID: 30055645
