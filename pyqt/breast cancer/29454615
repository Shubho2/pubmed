Electronic address: reinhard.paschke@biozentrum.uni-halle.de.In this report, we describe the synthesis, characterization, in vitro anticancer activity and Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) inhibition of new sulfamate conjugates of Betulin and Betulinic acid (BA). The betulinyl sulfamates were subjected toinhibit carbonic anhydrases (CA), e.g. CAIX, an attractive target fortumor-selective therapy strategies in cancer cells. Data on combined in vitroantitumor activity with CAIX inhibition are very rare. The betulinyl sulfamateswere tested against five tumor cell lines and normal human skin fibroblasts. The mode of cell death on MCF7 breast cancer cells induced by the most activecompounds CAI1, CAI3 and CAI6 was investigated by Fluorescence Activated CellSorting (FACS) experiments. The compounds showed inhibitory activity towardsCAIX, which was determined via in vitro enz-yme assay. Our preliminaryinvestigations revealed that all compounds showed potent anticancer propertieswith IC50 values below 20 μM against all tumor cells. Interestingly, among thepanel of sulfamate conjugates, CAI3 found to be highly cytotoxic (averageIC50 = 5-10 μM) and possess high inhibitory activity (Ki = 1.25 nM) towards CAIX.Our results suggest that betulinyl sulfamates seem to be attractive substances,due to their possibility of targeted drug delivery they deserve to be proceededfor further pre-clinical (kinetic studies) and in vivo investigations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
