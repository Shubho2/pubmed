Through this decouplingfabrication strategy, our microfluidic concentrator chip can easily be integratedwith a standard multiwell plate, the de facto laboratory standard platform forhigh-throughput assays, simply by reversible bonding on the bottom of each well. It increases the reaction rate of enzymatic assays by concentrating the enzymeand the reaction product inside each well simultaneously for rapid multiplexeddetection.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29065-7 PMCID: PMC6050343PMID: 30018340
