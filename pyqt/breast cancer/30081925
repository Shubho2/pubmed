In this review, we discuss the role ofRab27 GTPases in cancer progression and the potential applications of thesetargets in cancer treatment.MAIN BODY: Elevated expression of Rab27 GTPases is associated with poor prognosisand cancer metastasis. Moreover, these GTPases govern a variety of oncogenicfunctions, including cell proliferation, cell motility, and chemosensitivity. In addition, small GTPases promote tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing exosome secretion, which alters intracellular microRNA levels, signaling moleculeexpression, and the tumor microenvironment.CONCLUSION: Rab27 GTPases may have applications as prognostic markers andtherapeutic targets in cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s12964-018-0255-9 PMCID: PMC6080553PMID: 30081925
