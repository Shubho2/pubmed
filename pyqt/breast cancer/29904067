Althoughelevated CIC formation was found in cancers with CDKN2A inactivation, a causallink between them remains to be established. We reported here that inhibitingCDKN2A expression effectively promoted homotypic CIC formation, whereas ectopicoverexpression of p16INK4a or p14ARF, two proteins encoded by CDKN2A gene,significantly suppressed CIC formation in MCF7 cells. The regulation of CICformation by CDKN2A was tightly correlated with subcellular redistribution ofE-cadherin, F-actin rearrangement and reduced phosphorylation of myosin lightchain 2 (p-MLC2), consistent with which, CDKN2A expression imparted cellswinner/outer identity in competition assay. Moreover, CIC formation negativelycorrelates with p16INK4a expression in human breast cancers. Thus, our workidentifies CDKN2A as the first tumor suppressor whose inactivation promoteshomotypic CIC formation in human cancer cells.DOI: 10.1038/s41389-018-0056-4 PMCID: PMC6002405PMID: 29904067
