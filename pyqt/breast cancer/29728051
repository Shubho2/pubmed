Furthermore, the presence of outliers, either experimental errors orinteresting abnormal clinical cases, may severely hamper a correct classificationof patients and the identification of reliable biomarkers for a particulardisease. We propose to address this problem through an ensemble classificationsetting based on distinct feature selection and modeling strategies, includinglogistic regression with elastic net regularization, Sparse Partial Least Squares- Discriminant Analysis (SPLS-DA) and Sparse Generalized PLS (SGPLS), coupledwith an evaluation of the individuals' outlierness based on the Cook's distance. The consensus is achieved with the Rank Product statistics corrected for multipletesting, which gives a final list of sorted observations by their outliernesslevel.RESULTS: We applied this strategy for the classification of Triple-NegativeBreast Cancer (TNBC) RNA-Seq and clinical data from the Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA). The detected 24 outliers were identified as putative mislabeled samples, corresponding to individuals with discrepant clinical labels for the HER2receptor, but also individuals with abnormal expression values of ER, PR andHER2, contradictory with the corresponding clinical labels, which may invalidate the initial TNBC label. Moreover, the model consensus approach leads to theselection of a set of genes that may be linked to the disease. These results are robust to a resampling approach, either by selecting a subset of patients or asubset of genes, with a significant overlap of the outlier patients identified.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed ensemble outlier detection approach constitutes arobust procedure to identify abnormal cases and consensus covariates, which mayimprove biomarker selection for precision medicine applications. The method canalso be easily extended to other regression models and datasets.DOI: 10.1186/s12859-018-2149-7 PMCID: PMC5936001PMID: 29728051
