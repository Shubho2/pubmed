In this study, we report the preliminary experience andclinical outcome of robotic assisted quadrantectomy (RAQ) and immediate partialbreast reconstruction (IPBR) with RLDFH.PATIENT CONCERN: Decreasing and avoid back scar length after latissimus dorsiflap harvest.DIAGNOSES: One 28 years old female with left breast cancer underwent RAQ and IPBRwith RLDFH. Initially, she was diagnosed with left breast infiltrating carcinoma that was clinical stage T3N1M0 and triple negative.INTERVENTIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 4 cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel was performed. Breast magneticresonance imaging showed residual breast cancer about 4.5 cm over the left upper outer quadrant of the breast. Sentinel lymph node biopsy showed no lymph nodemetastasis. RAQ, which took 82 minutes, was performed first, and the resectedbreast specimen's weight was 203 gm. She received IPBR with RLDFH, which took 97 minutes.OUTCOMES: The overall blood loss was 40 mL. The final pathology result was ypT2(4.2 cm)N0 (sn0/3)M0 and stage IIA. The resection margin was free of tumors. The post-operative recovery was smooth except for seroma formation over the back,which was relieved after repeated aspiration at an outpatient clinic. The patientwas satisfied with the post-operative scar and aesthetic outcome. No localrecurrence, distant metastasis or case mortality was found during 5 months offollow-up.LESSONS: RAQ and IPBR with RLDFH is a safe alternative forsmall-to-medium-breast-size women with breast cancer who desire breastconservation and are indicated for volume replacement with autologous latissimus dorsi flap.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011373 PMID: 29979425  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
