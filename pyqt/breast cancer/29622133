Electronicaddress: ibedrosian@mdanderson.org.MR imaging is now readily available for surgeons to incorporate into theirpractice, thus, begging the question, is this new modality clinically useful?Current literature and expert opinion are reviewed concerning the implementation of breast MR imaging to clinical management of breast cancer. Although breast MR imaging is acknowledged to be highly sensitive in detection of breast cancer, itsroutine application to surgical practice remains controversial because thesegains in sensitivity have not been demonstrated to translate into improvedlong-term patient outcomes.
