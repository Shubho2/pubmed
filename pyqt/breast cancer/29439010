This study used a single 18F-FDG dual-acquisitionPET examination to simultaneously assess these two imaging features and todetermine whether they correlate with the same pretherapy tumor phenotypicfeatures and whether they are comparable or complementary in predictingpathologic complete response (pCR). Methods: This prospective study included 150 women with breast cancer and an indication for NAC. A 2-min chest-centereddynamic PET acquisition was performed at the time of 18F-FDG injection, followed by a delayed static PET acquisition 90 min later. Tumor BF was calculated fromthe dynamic acquisition using a validated first-pass model, and tumor SUVmax was calculated from the delayed acquisition. This dual acquisition was repeated afterthe first cycle of NAC to measure early changes in tumor BF and SUVmaxResults: A weak correlation was found between SUVmax and BF at baseline (r = 0.22; P =0.006). A high baseline SUVmax was associated with all biologic markers of tumor aggressiveness, including the triple-negative breast cancer subtype (P < 0.0001).In contrast, a high baseline BF was associated only with obesity (P = 0.002). Thechange in SUVmax (mean, -44.6% ± 27.4%) varied depending on theScarff-Bloom-Richardson grade, overexpression of human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 (HER2-positive), and lack of hormone receptor expression (P = 0.04, P < 0.001, and P = 0.01, respectively). BF (mean change, -26.9% ± 54.3%) showed adrastic reduction only in HER2-positive subtypes (-58.7% ± 30.0%), supporting theantiangiogenic effect of trastuzumab. Changes in SUVmax outperformed changes inBF for predicting pCR in all tumor subtypes: the areas under the curve for changein SUVmax were 0.82, 0.65, and 0.90 in the triple-negative, HER2-positive, andluminal subtypes, respectively. Conclusion: Of the two biologic hallmarks ofcancer evaluated in this study, a reduction in tumor glucose metabolism was more accurate than a reduction in tumor BF for predicting pCR in the differentsubtypes of breast cancer.© 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.117.203075 PMID: 29439010
