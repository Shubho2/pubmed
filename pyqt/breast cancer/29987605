We report the feasibility ofBCT in MIBC from the ACOSOG Z11102 trial [Alliance], a single arm noninferiority trial of BCT for women with two or three sites of malignancy in the ipsilateralbreast.METHODS: Women who enrolled preoperatively in ACOSOG Z11102 were evaluated forconversion to mastectomy and need for reoperation to obtain negative margins.Characteristics of women who successfully underwent BCT and those who convertedto mastectomy were compared. Factors were examined for association with the need for margin reexcision.RESULTS: Of 198 patients enrolled preoperatively, 190 (96%) had 2 foci ofdisease. Median size of the largest tumor focus was 1.5 (range 0.1-7.0) cm; 49patients (24.8%) had positive nodes. There were 14 women who underwent mastectomydue to positive margins, resulting in a conversion to mastectomy rate of 7.1%(95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9-10.6%). Of 184 patients who successfullycompleted BCT, 134 completed this in a single operation. Multivariable logisticregression analysis did not identify any factors significantly associated withconversion to mastectomy or need for margin reexcision.CONCLUSIONS: Breast conservation is feasible in MIBC with 67.6% of patientsachieving a margin-negative excision in a single operation and 7.1% of patientsrequiring conversion to mastectomy due to positive margins. No characteristic wasidentified that significantly altered the risk of conversion to mastectomy orneed for reexcision.
