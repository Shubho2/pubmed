As observed for β-lapachone (3), the activenaphthoquinones all induced apoptosis in a cell-cycle-independent fashion. Incontrast to the pyran-fused β-lapachone (3), however, the most potent furan-fusednaphthoquinones were able to redox cycle and generate superoxide in cell-basedassays, which was independent of NAD(P)H:quinone oxido-reductase 1. In ahomogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assays with MDA-MB-231 cells, both napabucasin (6) and isonapabucasin (7) were identified as targeting STAT3phosphorylation. In addition, drug affinity responsive target stability assayswere performed to validate a direct interaction of the naphthoquinones withSTAT3. Isonapabucasin (7) turned out to be twice as potent against STAT3 asnapabucasin (6) in the HTRF assay, with an EC50 in the submicromolar range, whichwas in excellent agreement with the potency of both agents to inhibit the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, molecular docking experiments predicted different binding modes to the STAT3 SH2 domain for the linearly anellated napabucasin (6) and its angularly anellated isomer (7).DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b00247 PMID: 30003778
