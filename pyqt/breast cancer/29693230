Effort is made to minimize scarring on thebreast, yet patients who require a port for treatment inevitably have a scar onthe upper chest from the port itself. We hypothesized that patients with breastcancer are conscious of their port scars, and if given a choice would preferplacement of the port in the arm rather than the chest.METHODS: Female breast cancer patients treated at our Breast Center who had aport placed from 2009 to 2015 were asked to complete a 20-question, anonymoussurvey via SurveyMonkey® reporting demographics and treatment information, and a validated Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ).RESULTS: Of 139 identified, 105 had email information available for contact, and 67 (64%) patients responded. Of the 67, 37 (55%) had undergone arm placement and 30 (45%), chest. Sixty (92%) patients report noticing their scars; 44 (69%)believed that their scar was noticeable to others; and 22 of the 44 (50%) made aneffort to hide their scar. Thirty-seven patients were offered options for portsite placement, and 24 (65%) chose placement in the arm (p = 0.057).CONCLUSION: Most patients are conscious of their port scars and if offered thechoice choose placement in the arm rather than the chest. Upper extremity portplacement should be further explored as an alternative approach for patients withbreast cancer to improve port scar consciousness.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4790-2 PMID: 29693230
