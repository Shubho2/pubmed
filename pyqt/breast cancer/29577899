Further,glycosylation on integrin is necessary for its proper folding and functionality. Herein, differential expression of integrins viz., αvβ3 and αvβ6 was examined in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF-10A cells, which signify three different stages ofbreast cancer development from highly metastatic to non-tumorigenic stage. Theexpression of αvβ3 and αvβ6 integrins at mRNA and protein levels was observed in all three cell lines and the results displayed a distinct pattern of expression. Highly metastatic cells showed enhanced expression of αvβ3 than moderatemetastatic and non-tumorigenic cells. The scenario was reversed in case of αvβ6integrin, which was strongly expressed in moderate metastatic and non-tumorigeniccells. N-glycosylation of αvβ3 and αvβ6 integrins is required for the attachment of cells to ECM proteins like fibronectin. The cell adhesion properties werefound to be different in these cancer cells with respect to the type of integrinsexpressed. The results testify that αvβ3 integrin in highly metastatic cells,αvβ6 integrin in both moderate metastatic and non-tumorigenic cells play animportant role in cell adhesion. The investigation typify that N-glycosylation onintegrins is also necessary for cell-ECM interaction. Further, glycosylationinhibition by Swainsonine is found to be more detrimental to invasive property ofmoderate metastatic cells. Conclusively, types of integrins expressed as well as their N-glycosylation pattern alter during the course of breast cancerprogression.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
