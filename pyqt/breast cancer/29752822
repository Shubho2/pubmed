In this study, we assessed the frequency of germline mutations in 40cancer predisposition genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, among a large cohort ofChinese patients with high hereditary risk of BC. From 2015 to 2016, consecutive BC patients from 26 centers of China with high hereditary risk were recruited(n=937). Clinical information was collected and next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using blood samples of participants to identify germline mutations.In total, we acquired 223 patients with putative germline mutations, including159 in BRCA1/2, 61 in 15 other BC susceptibility genes and 3 in both BRCA1/2 and non-BRCA1/2 gene. Major mutant non-BRCA1/2 genes were TP53 (n=18), PALB2 (n=11), CHEK2 (n=6), ATM (n=6), and BARD1 (n=5). No factors predicted pathologicmutations in non-BRCA1/2 genes when treated as a whole. TP53 mutations wereassociated with HER-2 positive BC and younger age at diagnosis; and CHEK2 andPALB2 mutations were enriched in patients with luminal BC. Among high hereditary risk Chinese BC patients, 23.8% contained germline mutations, including 6.8% innon-BRCA1/2 genes. TP53 and PALB2 had a relatively high mutation rates (1.9% and 1.2%). Although no factors predicted for detrimental mutations in non-BRCA1/2genes, some clinical features were associated with mutations of severalparticular genes. This article is protected by copyright.
