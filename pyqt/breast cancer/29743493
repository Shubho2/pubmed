Despite recent progress in understanding the biological and moleculardeterminants of BC metastasis, effective therapeutic treatments are yet to bedeveloped. Among the multitude of molecular mechanisms that regulate cancermetastasis, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program plays a keyrole in the activation of the biological steps leading to the metastaticphenotype. Kindlin-2 has been associated with the pathogenesis of several typesof cancers, including BC. The role of Kindlin-2 in the regulation of BCmetastasis, and to a lesser extent in EMT is not well understood. In this study, we show that Kindlin-2 is closely associated with the development of themetastatic phenotype in BC. We report that knockout of Kindlin-2 in either human or mouse BC cells, significantly inhibits metastasis in both human and mousemodels of BC metastasis. We also report that the Kindlin-2-mediated inhibition ofmetastasis is the result of inhibition of expression of key molecular markers of the EMT program. Mechanistically, we show that miR-200b, a master regulator ofEMT, directly targets and inhibits the expression of Kindlin-2, leading to thesubsequent inhibition of EMT and metastasis. Together, our data support thetargeting of Kindlin-2 as a therapeutic strategy against BC metastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25373-0 PMID: 29743493
