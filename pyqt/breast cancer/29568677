All study participants were of Norwegianethnicity.Results: LRRK2 mutation carriers have increased risk of non-skin cancer compared with iPD subjects (OR 2.09; 95% CI 1.16-3.77; p = .015). A significantassociation was found between the mutation and breast cancer in women (OR 4.58;95% CI 1.45-14.51; p = .010). No other associations between harboring a LRRK2mutation and specific cancer types were uncovered.Conclusion: LRRK2 mutation carriers have an increased risk of non-skin cancercompared with iPD subjects, which was mainly driven by the association betweenharboring the mutation and breast cancer in women. The increased risk is likelyindependent of ethnicity.DOI: 10.1002/brb3.858 PMCID: PMC5853627PMID: 29568677
