Electronic address: hmorita@inm.u-toyama.ac.jp.Three new diterpenoids, spiroscutelones A-C (1-3), along with known diterpene 4, were isolated from the leaves of Plectranthus scutellarioides. Their structureswere established based on extensive spectroscopic analyses, including MS and NMR spectroscopy. Spiroscutelone A (1) represents the first example of anabietane-type terpenoid skeleton with a cyclobutane moiety linking the B and Crings. Of compounds 1-4, spiroscutelone B (2) exhibited the most potentcytotoxicities against the three tested human cancer lines [breast (MCF-7),pancreatic (PSN-1), and cervical (HeLa)] with IC50 values ranging from 17.9 μM to29.8 μM and low cytotoxicity against a lung fibroblast (WI-38) normal cell line.Copyright © 2018.
