[Epub ahead of print]New piperidine derivative DTPEP acts as dual-acting anti-breast cancer agent bytargeting ERα and downregulating PI3K/Akt-PKCα leading to caspase-dependentapoptosis.Arun A(1), Ansari MI(2), Popli P(1), Jaiswal S(2), Mishra AK(3), Dwivedi A(1)(4),Hajela K(2), Konwar R(1)(4).Author information: (1)Endocrinology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, UP,India.(2)Medicinal and Process Chemistry Division, CSIR-Central Drug ResearchInstitute, Lucknow, UP, India.(3)Department of Endocrine Surgery, King George's Medical University, Lucknow,UP, India.(4)Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-Central DrugResearch Institute Campus, Lucknow, UP, India.OBJECTIVES: In our ongoing studies to develop ER targeting agents, we screenedfor dual-acting molecules with a hypothesis that a single molecule can alsotarget both ER positive and negative groups of breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS:1-(2-(4-(Dibenzo[b,f]thiepin-10-yl)phenoxy)ethyl)piperidine (DTPEP) wassynthesized and screened in both MCF-7 (ER+ve) and MDA-MB-231 (ER-ve) cells.Assays for analysis of cell cycle, ROS, apoptosis and MMP loss were carried outusing flow cytometry. Its target was investigated using western blot,transactivation assay and RT-PCR. In vivo efficacy of DTPEP was validated in LA-7syngeneic rat mammary tumour model.RESULTS: Here, we report identification of dual-acting molecule DTPEP thatdownregualtes PI3K/Akt and PKCα expression, induces ROS and ROS-dependentapoptosis, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, induces expression ofcaspase indicative of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis in MCF-7 andMDA-MB-231 cells. In MCF-7 cells, DTPEP downregulates ERα expression andactivation. In MDA-MB-231 cells, primary cellular target of DTPEP is not clearly known, but it downregualtes PI3K/Akt and PKCα expression. In vivo study showedregression of LA-7 syngeneic mammary tumour in SD rat.CONCLUSIONS: We identified a new dual-acting anti-breast cancer molecules as aproof of concept which is capable of targeting both ER-positive and ER-negativebreast cancer.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/cpr.12501 PMID: 30091186
