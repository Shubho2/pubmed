China.Objective: Cancer patients with bone marrow metastases are rare and dismal. Thestudy was to identify the clinical features and prognostic factors in cancerpatients with bone marrow metastases.Patients and Methods: A total of 30 patients with bone marrow metastases werereviewed between September 2007 and September 2013. Bone marrow metastases wereidentified by bone marrow aspiration.Results: The median age was 56.5 years (range, 8-85 years). The two most commonprimary tumor sites were the stomach (7, 23.3%), breast (5, 16.7%). Bonemetastases (27, 90.0%) were the most common concurrent metastases. The mostcommon cause for bone marrow aspiration was anemia and thrombocytopenia (10,33.3%). The median survival time was 3 months (range, 0.5-82 months). Patientswith good performance status (n = 19) had a longer median survival time thanpatients with poor performance status (n = 11) (8 months vs. 1 months, P =0.041). Patients with primary unknown origin (n = 5) had a significantly shorter overall survival time than patients with known origin (n = 25) (1 month vs. 6months = 0.010). The median survival time was 9 months in the systemic therapygroup (n = 21) and 1 month in the best supportive care group (n = 9) (P = 0.000).Conclusion: To make primary origin clear and start systemic antitumor therapy is beneficial for patients with bone marrow metastases.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.172717 PMID: 29970716
