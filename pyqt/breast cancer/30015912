The results from target gene prediction revealed that microRNA (miR)‑185‑5p had a RAGE binding site. However, the function of miR‑185‑5p in the invasion and migration of breast cancer remains ambiguous. In the present study, the expression of miR‑185‑5p was examined in breast cancer tissues and cells.Clinical features revealed a negative correlation between miR‑185‑5p and tumorsize, as well as in tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis in breastcancer. In addition, miR‑185‑5p was negatively associated with RAGE, and thismiRNA reversed the EMT of breast cancer by modulating RAGE in vitro. In addition,miR‑185‑5p inhibited the S100A8/A9‑induced EMT of breast cancer cells by thenuclear factor‑κB/Snail signaling pathway. Notably, miR‑185‑5p upregulationinhibited the F‑actin polymerization induced by S100A8/A9 in breast cancer.Furthermore, overexpression of miR‑185‑5p and reduction of RAGE inhibited lungmetastasis node in vivo. Thus, miR‑185‑5p represents a potential therapeutictarget in breast cancer by modulating RAGE.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9294 PMID: 30015912
