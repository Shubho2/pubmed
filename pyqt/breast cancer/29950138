[Epubahead of print]Absence of sustained breast cancer incidence inflation in a national mammography screening programme.Morrell S(1), Gregory M(2), Sexton K(2), Wharton J(1), Sharma N(1), Taylor R(1).Author information: (1)1 School of Public Health and Community Medicine, University of NSW, Sydney,Australia.(2)2 BreastScreen Aotearoa, National Screening Unit, Ministry of Health,Wellington, New Zealand.Objective To investigate the impact of population mammography screening on breastcancer incidence trends in New Zealand. Methods Trends in age-specific rates ofinvasive breast cancer incidence (1994-2014) were assessed in relation toscreening in women aged 50-64 from 1999 and 45-69 following the programme ageextension in mid-2004. Results Breast cancer incidence increased significantly by18% in women aged 50-64 compared with 1994-98 (p<0.0001), coinciding with the1999 introduction of mammography screening, and remained elevated for four years,before declining to pre-screening levels. Increases over 1994-99 incidenceoccurred in the 45-49 (21%) and 65-69 (19%) age groups following the 2004 ageextension (p<0.0001). Following establishment of screening (2006-10), elevatedincidence in the screening target age groups was compensated for by lowerincidence in the post-screening ⩾70 age groups than in 1994-98. Incidence inwomen aged ⩾45 was not significantly higher (+5%) after 2006 than in 1994-98. Thecumulated risk of breast cancer in women aged 45-84 for 1994-98 was 10.7%compared with 10.8% in 2006-10. Conclusions Increases in breast cancer incidence following introduction of mammography screening in women aged 50-64 did notpersist. Incidence inflation also occurred after introduction of screening forage groups 45-49 and 65-69. The cumulated incidence for women aged 45-84 over2006-10 after screening was well established, compared with 1994-98 prior toscreening, shows no increase in diagnosis. Over-diagnosis is not inevitable inpopulation mammography screening programmes.DOI: 10.1177/0969141318775766 PMID: 29950138
