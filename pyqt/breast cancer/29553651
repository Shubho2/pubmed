196. The Effectiveness of Physical Exercise for People with Cancer [Internet].Dahm KT, Larun L, Kirkehei I, Reinar LM.Oslo, Norway: Knowledge Centre for the Health Services at The Norwegian Instituteof Public Health (NIPH); 2016 Dec. Report from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health No. 2016-16.NIPH Systematic Reviews: Executive Summaries.The National Cancer Strategy for 2013-2017 published by The Norwegian Ministry ofHealth and Care Services, notes that physical activity is an important adjunctivetreatment both during active cancer treatment and after the treatment iscompleted. We have summarised the results from five systematic reviews, on theeffects of exercise for cancer patients during and after cancer treatment,including a total of 119 randomised clinical trials. In summary, the reviewsshow:It is uncertain if exercise during active cancer treatment has an effect on quality of life, self reported physical function, anxiety, depression andfatigue. Exercise for cancer survivors might have a positive effect on quality oflife, self reported physical function, anxiety and fatigue. Weight training does not seem to increase the severity of lymphedema in women who have received breastcancer surgery. The results from this review should be interpreted with caution. The certainty of the evidence, based on the included systematic reviews, is lowor very low mainly due to small studies with high risk of bias. There is a needfor research investigating if any specific type, intensity or duration ofphysical exercise gives better results than others. The evidence is sparse forthe effect of exercise during and after cancer treatment for the outcomessurvival, recurrence of cancer and serious adverse events.PMID: 29553651
