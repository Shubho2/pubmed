Despitecurrent research focused on understanding the genetic landscape of TNBCs,reliable prognostic and predictive biomarkers remain limited. Althoughdysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key players in many cancer types,the role of miRNAs in TNBC disease progression is unclear. We performed miRNAprofiling of 51 TNBCs by next-generation sequencing to reveal differentiallyexpressed miRNAs. A total of 228 miRNAs were identified. Three miRNAs(miR-224-5p, miR-375, and miR-205-5p) separated the tumors based on basal status.Six miRNAs (high let-7d-3p, miR-203b-5p, and miR-324-5p; low miR-30a-3p,miR-30a-5p, and miR-199a-5p) were significantly associated with decreased overallsurvival (OS) and 5 miRNAs (high let-7d-3p; low miR-30a-3p, miR-30a-5p,miR-30c-5p, and miR-128-3p) with decreased relapse-free survival (RFS). Onmultivariate analysis, high expression of let-7d-3p and low expression of miR-30awere independent predictors of decreased OS and RFS. High expression of miR-95-3pwas significantly associated with decreased OS and RFS in patients treated withanthracycline-based chemotherapy. Five miRNAs (let-7d-3p, miR-30a-3p, miR-30c-5p,miR-128-3p, and miR-95-3p) were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Our findingsunveil novel prognostic and predictive miRNA targets for TNBC, including a miRNA signature that predicts patient response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy.This may improve clinical management and/or lead to the development of noveltherapies.-Turashvili, G., Lightbody, E.
