The present system can measure theoutline of the breast with an accuracy of &plusmn;1 mm and precisely place themicrowave sensor in an adaptive matter such that microwaves are normally incidenton the skin. Microwave reflections are measured between 10 MHz to 12 GHz withsensitivity of 65 to 75 dB below the input power and a total scan time of 30 min for 140 locations. The time domain reflections measured from a volunteer showfidelity above 0.98 for signals in a single scan. Finally, multiple scans of abreast phantoms demonstrate the consistency of the system in terms of recordedreflection, outline measurement, and image reconstruction.DOI: 10.3390/s18051340 PMCID: PMC5982192PMID: 29701677  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
