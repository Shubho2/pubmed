Small studiessuggest that acupuncture may decrease aromatase inhibitor-related joint symptoms.Objective: To determine the effect of acupuncture in reducing aromataseinhibitor-related joint pain.Design, Setting, and Patients: Randomized clinical trial conducted at 11 academiccenters and clinical sites in the United States from March 2012 to February 2017 (final date of follow-up, September 5, 2017). Eligible patients werepostmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer who were taking an aromatase inhibitor and scored at least 3 on the Brief Pain Inventory Worst Pain (BPI-WP)item (score range, 0-10; higher scores indicate greater pain).Interventions: Patients were randomized 2:1:1 to the true acupuncture (n = 110), sham acupuncture (n = 59), or waitlist control (n = 57) group. True acupunctureand sham acupuncture protocols consisted of 12 acupuncture sessions over 6 weeks (2 sessions per week), followed by 1 session per week for 6 weeks. The waitlistcontrol group did not receive any intervention. All participants were offered 10 acupuncture sessions to be used between weeks 24 and 52.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the 6-week BPI-WP score.Mean 6-week BPI-WP scores were compared by study group using linear regression,adjusted for baseline pain and stratification factors (clinically meaningfuldifference specified as 2 points).Results: Among 226 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 60.7 [8.6] years; 88%white; mean [SD] baseline BPI-WP score, 6.6 [1.5]), 206 (91.1%) completed thetrial. From baseline to 6 weeks, the mean observed BPI-WP score decreased by 2.05points (reduced pain) in the true acupuncture group, by 1.07 points in the shamacupuncture group, and by 0.99 points in the waitlist control group. The adjusteddifference for true acupuncture vs sham acupuncture was 0.92 points (95% CI,0.20-1.65; P = .01) and for true acupuncture vs waitlist control was 0.96 points (95% CI, 0.24-1.67; P = .01). Patients in the true acupuncture group experienced more grade 1 bruising compared with patients in the sham acupuncture group (47%vs 25%; P = .01).Conclusions and Relevance: Among postmenopausal women with early-stage breastcancer and aromatase inhibitor-related arthralgias, true acupuncture comparedwith sham acupuncture or with waitlist control resulted in a statisticallysignificant reduction in joint pain at 6 weeks, although the observed improvementwas of uncertain clinical importance.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01535066.DOI: 10.1001/jama.2018.8907 PMID: 29998338  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
