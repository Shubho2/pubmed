Probing tumor-derivedexosomes can offer a potential non-invasive way to diagnose cancer, assess cancerprogression, and monitor treatment responses. Novel molecular methods wouldfacilitate exosome analysis and accelerate basic and clinical exosome research.Methods: A standard gold-coated glass microscopy slide was used to develop aminiaturized affinity-based device to capture exosomes in a target-specificmanner with the assistance of low-cost 3-D printing technology. Gold nanorodscoated with QSY21 Raman reporters were used as the label agent to quantitatively detect the target proteins based on surface enhanced Raman scatteringspectroscopy. The expressions of several surface protein markers on exosomes fromconditioned culture media of breast cancer cells and from HER2-positive breastcancer patients were quantitatively measured. The data was statistically analyzedand compared with healthy controls. Results: A miniaturized 17 × 5 Au arraydevice with 2-mm well size was fabricated to capture exosomes in atarget-specific manner and detect the target proteins on exosomes with surfaceenhanced Raman scattering gold nanorods. This assay can specifically detectexosomes with a limit of detection of 2×106 exosomes/mL and analyze over 80purified samples on a single device within 2 h. Using the assay, we have showedthat exosomes derived from MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and SKBR3 breast cancer cells give distinct protein profiles compared to exosomes derived from MCF12A normalbreast cells. We have also showed that exosomes in the plasma from HER2-positive breast cancer patients exhibit significantly (P ≤ 0.01) higher level of HER2 and EpCAM than those from healthy donors. Conclusion: We have developed a simple,inexpensive, highly efficient, and portable Raman exosome assay for detection andprotein profiling of exosomes. Using the assay and model exosomes from breastcancer cells, we have showed that exosomes exhibit diagnostic surface proteinmarkers, reflecting the protein profile of their donor cells. Throughproof-of-concept studies, we have identified HER2 and EpCAM biomarkers onexosomes in plasma from HER2-positive breast cancer patients, suggesting thediagnostic potential of these markers for breast cancer diagnostics. This assaywould accelerate exosome research and pave a way to the development of novelcancer liquid biopsy for cancer detection and monitoring.DOI: 10.7150/thno.21358 PMCID: PMC5957005PMID: 29774071
