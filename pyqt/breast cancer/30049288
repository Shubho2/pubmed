However, to date, the question of epimutationaltransmission of these genes remains unresolved. Here, we studied the potentialtransmission of BRCA1 and MGMT promoter methylations in mother-newborn pairs.METHODS: A total of 1014 female subjects (cancer-free women, n = 268; delivering women, n = 295; newborn females, n = 302; breast cancer patients, n = 67; ovariancancer patients, n = 82) were screened for methylation status in white bloodcells (WBC) using methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite pyrosequencing assays.In addition, BRCA1 gene expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-timePCR.RESULTS: We found similar methylation frequencies in newborn and adults for both BRCA1 (9.9 and 9.3%) and MGMT (12.3 and 13.1%). Of the 290 mother-newborn pairsanalyzed for promoter methylation, 20 mothers were found to be positive for BRCA1and 29 for MGMT. Four mother-newborn pairs were positive for methylated BRCA1(20%) and nine pairs were positive for methylated MGMT (31%). Intriguingly, thedelivering women had 26% lower BRCA1 and MGMT methylation frequencies than those of the cancer-free female subjects. BRCA1 was downregulated in both cancer-freewoman carriers and breast cancer patients but not in newborn carriers. There was a statistically significant association between the MGMT promoter methylation andlate-onset breast cancers.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that BRCA1and MGMT epimutations are presentfrom the early life of the carriers. We show the transmission of BRCA1 and MGMTepimutations from mother to daughter. Our data also point at the possibledemethylation of BRCA1and MGMT during pregnancy.DOI: 10.1186/s13148-018-0529-5 PMCID: PMC6062990PMID: 30049288
