Treatment selection is frequently guided by themolecular characteristics of a patient's tumor, and an increasing number oftrials are genomically selected. Furthermore, multiple studies have demonstrated the benefit of therapies that are chosen based upon the molecular profile of atumor. However, the rapid evolution of genomic testing platforms and emergence ofnew technologies make interpreting molecular testing reports more challenging.More sophisticated precision oncology decision support services are essential.This review outlines existing tools available for health care providers andprecision oncology teams and highlights strategies for optimizing decisionsupport. Specific attention is given to the assays currently available formolecular testing, as well as considerations for interpreting alterationinformation. This article also discusses strategies for identifying and matching patients to clinical trials, current challenges, and proposals for futuredevelopment of precision oncology decision support.
