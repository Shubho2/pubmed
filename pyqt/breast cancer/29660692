Failure of cancer therapies can also be accredited toinability to systemically eradicate cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recent evidencepoints to the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in expanding thepool of tumor cells with CSCs features. Thus, we assessed expression level aswell as heterogeneity of CSCs markers in primary tumors (PT), lymph nodemetastasis (LNM), and circulating tumor cells (CTCs)-enriched blood fractions in order to correlate them with signs of EMT activation as well asclinicopathological data of breast cancer patients. Level of CSCs markers (ALDH1,CD44, CD133, OCT-4, NANOG) and EMT markers was quantified in PT (N=107), LNM(N=56), and CTCs-enriched blood fractions (N=85). Heterogeneity of CSCs markersexpression within each PT and LNM was assessed by calculating Gini Index.Percentage of ALDH1-positive cells was elevated in PT in comparison to LNM (P =.005). However, heterogeneity of the four CSCs markers: ALDH1 (P = .019), CD133(P = .009), OCT-4 (P = .027), and CD44 (P < .001) was decreased in LNM. Samplesclassified as mesenchymal (post-EMT) showed elevated expression of CSCs markers(OCT-4 and CD44 in PT; OCT-4 in LNM; ALDH1, OCT-4, NANOG, CD44 in CTCs). Patientswith mesenchymal-like CTCs had worse prognosis than patients with epithelial-likeor no CTCs (P = .0025). CSCs markers are enriched in PT, LNM, and CTCs withmesenchymal features, but their heterogeneity is decreased in metastatic lymphnodes. Mesenchymal CTCs phenotype correlates with poor prognosis of the patients.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
