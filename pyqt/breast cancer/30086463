MicroRNAs (miRNAs), smallnon-coding RNAs, perform vital functions in cellular differentiation, metabolism and physiological processes. MiR-133a acts as a tumor suppressor in breast, lung and gastric cancer, while the molecular circadian mechanism has not been clear inHCC. In the present study, we certified that the expression of miR-133a decreasedin HCC tissues and cell lines and that miR-133a inhibited proliferation,migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Fos-related antigen 2(FOSL2), also named FRA-2, was predicted to be a downstream target of miR-133abased on bioinformatic analysis and the prediction was verified by Western Blot, qRT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. In addition, there was a negativecorrelation between miR-133a and FOSL2 expression in HCC samples. Furthermore, weverified that overexpression of miR-133a suppressed biological behaviour of HCCthrough TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway. In brief, miR-133a may be a potentialprognostic biomarker and may thus be a new therapy in HCC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
