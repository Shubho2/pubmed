HDHPs require substantialout-of-pocket (OOP) costs for most services but often exempt medications fromhigh cost sharing. We examined effects of HDHPs on OOP costs and utilization ofadjuvant hormonal therapy (AHT), which are fundamental care for patients withbreast cancer.METHODS: This controlled quasi-experimental study used claims data (2003-2012)from a large national health insurer. We included 986 women with incidentearly-stage breast cancer, age 25-64 years, insured by employers that mandated a transition from low-deductible (≤ $500/year) to high-deductible (≥ $1000/year)coverage, and 3479 propensity score-matched controls whose employers offered onlylow-deductible plans. We examined AHT utilization and OOP costs per person-yearbefore and after the HDHP switch.RESULTS: At baseline, the OOP costs for AHT were $40.41 and $36.55 perperson-year among the HDHP and control groups. After the HDHP switch, the OOPcosts for AHT were $91.76 and $72.98 per person-year among the HDHP and controlgroups, respectively. AHT OOP costs increased among HDHP members relative tocontrols but the change was not significant (relative change 13.72% [95% CI- 9.25, 36.70%]). AHT use among HDHP members did not change compared to controls (relative change of 2.73% [95% CI - 14.01, 19.48%]); the change in aromataseinhibitor use was - 11.94% (95% CI - 32.76, 8.88%) and the change in tamoxifenuse was 20.65% (95% CI - 8.01, 49.32%).CONCLUSION: We did not detect significant changes in AHT use after the HDHPswitch. Findings might be related to modest increases in overall AHT OOP costs,the availability of low-cost generic tamoxifen, and patient awareness that AHTcan prolong life and health. Minimizing OOP cost increases for essentialmedications might represent a feasible approach for maintaining medicationadherence among HDHP members with incident breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4821-z PMID: 29754304
