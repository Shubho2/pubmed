The BRCA1 protein hasmultiple functional domains that interact with a variety of proteins in multiple cellular processes. Understanding the biological consequences of BRCA1interactions with its binding partners is important for elucidating itstissue-specific tumor suppression function. The Cofactor of BRCA1 (COBRA1) is aBRCA1-binding protein that, as a component of negative elongation factor (NELF), regulates RNA polymerase II pausing during transcription elongation. We recently identified a genetic interaction between mouse Brca1 and Cobra1 thatantagonistically regulates mammary gland development. However, it remains unclearwhich of the myriad functions of Brca1 are required for its genetic interactionwith Cobra1. Here, we show that, unlike deletion of Brca1 exon 11,separation-of-function mutations that abrogate either the E3 ligase activity ofits RING domain or the phospho-recognition property of its BRCT domain are notsufficient to rescue the mammary developmental defects in Cobra1 knockout mice.Furthermore, deletion of mouse Palb2, another breast cancer susceptibility genewith functional similarities to BRCA1, does not rescue Cobra1 knockout-associatedmammary defects. Thus, the Brca1/Cobra1 genetic interaction is both domain- andgene-specific in the context of mammary gland development.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-21044-2 PMCID: PMC5807304PMID: 29426838
