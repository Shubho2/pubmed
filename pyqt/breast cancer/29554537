The radiographic finding of sclerosing adenosis is aspiculated mass and can look like invasive ductal carcinoma. We report a patient with DCIS in sclerosing adenosis encapsulated by a hamartoma, with imagingfindings quite different from the typical findings of sclerosing adenosis.PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 73-year old woman, with no previous mammography,presented with a palpable mass in the left breast. Mammography showed a 36 mmwell-defined mass with fat density in the middle outer quadrant of the leftbreast. Ultrasonography showed a well-defined mass in the same area which wascomposed of hypoechoic and hyperechoic areas. The histological diagnosis by core needle biopsy was sclerosing adenosis. We considered the patient's age and tumor size and performed a partial mastectomy for both diagnosis and treatment. Finalpathology showed DCIS in sclerosing adenosis in a hamartoma.DISCUSSION: This patient had DCIS in an area of sclerosing adenosis, encapsulatedby a hamartoma. DCIS can develop in areas of sclerosing adenosis, and can appear similar to invasive ductal carcinoma, so we must avoid misdiagnosis orover-treatment. Malignant transformation of a hamartoma is rare, but can occursince it contains epithelial tissue. Definitive biopsy should be performed due tothe possibility of a malignancy inside the hamartoma.CONCLUSIONS: When diagnosing a hamartoma, the presence of atypical findings onimaging studies, should suggest the possibility of malignancy. Although rare, amalignant tumor may be present inside the hamartoma.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..
