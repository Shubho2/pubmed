It is reported thatFOXP3 is usually mutant, absent, or cytoplasmic distribution in breast cancercells, which increases the risk of breast cancer. However, in our study thefull-length FOXP3 transcript can be detected in breast cancer cells and nuclearFOXP3 is expressed in some breast cancer samples. Therefore, an importantquestion is how the tumor-suppressive function of wild-type FOXP3 is negated inthese cancers. We found that Gal-1 is a novel interacting protein of FOXP3 inbreast cancer. Furthermore, our results show that the FKH domain in FOXP3 isessential for its interaction with Gal-1. Through ChIP-seq assay, we found thatthe expression of Gal-1 could inhibit a variety of target genes which weredirectly regulated by FOXP3. More importantly, these FOXP3-bound genes areinvolved in the development and metastasis of cancer. Furthermore, functionalstudies revealed that blocking the FOXP3/Gal-1 interaction restores thetumor-suppressive properties of FOXP3 in breast cancer cells. Finally, weobserved that the nuclear abundance of Gal-1 was significantly higher in breastcancer tissues than that in adjacent normal tissues. In addition, we identifiedthat the acidic extracellular microenvironment in breast cancer tissues causesGal-1 to accumulate in the nucleus. Altogether, nuclear Gal-1 interferes with thebinding of FOXP3 to DNA by interacting with the FKH domain of FOXP3, and itindicates a possible mechanism for the loss of the tumor-suppressive propertiesof FOXP3 in wild-type FOXP3-positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0448-6 PMCID: PMC5856744PMID: 29549328
