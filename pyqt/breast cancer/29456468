To highlight different psychological outcomes, studies werecategorized into those describing: anxiety, depression, body image andsatisfaction with the surgical outcome. We also compared patients aftermastectomy alone with those undergoing immediate or delayed reconstruction.Results: Methodologies and psychological outcomes varied among the identifiedstudies, making it difficult to compare results. There are contradictory outcomesconcerning the psychosocial aspects of breast cancer patients after mastectomyalone compared with those who underwent an immediate or delayed reconstructionfollowing mastectomy. Some studies show that immediate reconstruction aftermastectomy had a positive impact on patients' psychological well-being. Incontrast, other studies indicated that in the long-term view the compared patientgroups were very similar concerning psychosocial aspects.Conclusion: Analyzing different aspects of psychosocial well-being after breastcancer surgery, there might be an advantage in choosing immediate reconstruction,if oncological safety allows it.DOI: 10.1159/000485234 PMCID: PMC5803679 [Available on 2018-12-01]PMID: 29456468
