Electronic address: mary.salvatore@mountsinai.org.(2)Department of Radiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York,NY, United States.The benefits of early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are wellestablished. Thoracic CT which is performed with increased frequency for lungcancer screening can diagnose breast cancer earlier then might be possibleclinically. The imaged and radiation exposed breasts must be included in theirentirety on images which are reviewed by the radiologist. Because of concernsabout how altering the field of view might affect image quality, we advocate for inclusion of the entire breast on the soft tissue series, which can be viewed on mediastinal window settings and expose the patient to no additional radiation.Copyright Â© 2018.
