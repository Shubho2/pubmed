In this study,we developed gold coated Fe2O3 nanoparticles for photothermal therapy of breastcancer cells. Methods: Fe2O3 nanoparticles was prepared via microemulsion method and their surface was modified via gold. Differential light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods were applied to evaluatephysicochemical properties of NPs. Gold coated NP was further modified with MUC-1aptamer as a targeting agent to increase drug delivery into the desired tissue.To evaluate cytotoxicity of prepared cells, MTT assay was employed. Targetingability of aptamer modified NPs was assessed through confocal microscopy and flowcytometry method. Subsequently, MCF-7 and CHO cells were treated with aptamermodified NPs and were then irradiated via near infrared light (NIR) to produceheat. Results: The morphology of NPs was spherical and monodisperse with the sizeof 16 nm, which was confirmed via DLS and TEM. Confocal microscopy and flowcytometry results indicated that aptamer modified NPs had higher uptake compared to bare NPs. Finally, NIR exposure results revealed that higher uptake of NPs andapplication of NIR led to significant death of MCF-7 cells compared to CHO cells.Conclusion: To sum up, aptamer modified Fe2O3 nanoparticles showed higher uptake by cancerous cells and led to eradication of cancerous cells after exposure toNIR light.DOI: 10.15171/apb.2018.024 PMCID: PMC6046429PMID: 30023321
