Women with the densest breasts were selected for visual interpretation of parenchymal pattern (PP). One hundred non-assessed women, aged 50, 55, 60, 65 and 69-71 years (total = 500), provided controls. Cases included women recalledfor assessment (mastectomy or implants excluded) (total = 280). Mammogramsreviewed by ten readers and PP classified as: (1) very smooth; (2) mainly smooth;(3) mixed; (4) mainly nodular; (5) very nodular. The ratio of women in eachcategory at each age and screening outcomes were compared by Pearson'schi-squared test.RESULTS: Reader agreement for scoring PP was good (intraclass correlation =0.6302). Proportions of women in each PP category were similar at all ages forcontrols (p = 0.147) and cases (p = 0.657). The ratio of PP categories did notvary significantly with age in those who underwent biopsy (p = 0.484).Thirty-four cancers were diagnosed. There was a significant correlation between adiagnosis of cancer and nodular PP compared to not nodular PP (p = 0.043).CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of smooth to nodular pattern in women with the densestbreasts did not vary with age. The PP of the breast tissue did not affectlikelihood of recall to assessment or biopsy. There was a significantrelationship between a nodular parenchymal pattern and diagnosis of cancer.KEY POINTS: • This paper shows that there is good agreement between mammogramreaders when classifying mammographic PP on a five-point scale from very smoothto very nodular. • In non-assessed women with the densest breasts, there is nosignificant change in the proportions of smooth to nodular patterns withincreasing age. • The likelihood of recall for further assessment or biopsy atassessment is not related to PP in women with highest breast density. • Whenrecalled for further assessment, significantly more women are diagnosed withcancer in the group with nodular PP on mammography when compared with smooth and mixed patterns.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5420-4 PMID: 29808426
