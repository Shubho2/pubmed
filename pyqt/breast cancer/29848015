BPE wasclassified into four categories before and after NAC. The association between BPEand the pathological tumor response to NAC, recurrence-free survival (RFS) andmolecular subtypes were analyzed. We also evaluated the associations between the baseline BPE before NAC and menopausal status or mammographic parenchymaldensity.RESULTS: Baseline BPE did not differ significantly according to the pathological tumor response to NAC (p = 0.2019). However, changes in BPE after NAC weresignificantly greater in the pathological complete remission (pCR) group than in the non-pCR group (p = 0.0008). There was no statistically significantassociation between BPE and RFS or molecular subtypes. The baseline BPE ofpre-menopausal females (2.77 ± 0.86) were greater than those of post-menopausalfemales (2.05 ± 0.69), with statistical significance (p < 0.0001). Baseline BPEshowed no significant difference according to mammographic parenchymal density.CONCLUSION: The degree of BPE reduction in breast MRI correlates with thepathological tumor response to NAC in breast cancer patients. No significantdifference in BPE was observed according to RFS or molecular subtypes of tumors. Advances in knowledge: This study suggests that the change in BPE may havepotential as a biomarker of tumor response in breast cancer patients receivingNAC.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170550 PMID: 29848015  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
