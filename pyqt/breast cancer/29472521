CASE REPORT We presented a case of a 48-year-old Asian female withbreast metaplastic SCC. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and core needlebiopsy (CNB) of the lesion were taken prior to surgical resection. FNAB smearsdemonstrated highly atypical squamous cells and a diagnosis positive formalignancy was rendered. CNB and a surgical resection specimen revealed invasive squamous carcinoma with keratin pearl formation and intercellular bridges.Further study demonstrated this was an unusual metaplastic SCC case withbasal-HER2 (+) phenotype. HER2 has been linked to poor prognosis and response to therapy. CONCLUSIONS The pathological diagnosis of the breast metaplastic SCC wasmade initially by FNAB and CNB. Identification of basal-HER2 (+) phenotype wascritical for selection of hormonal therapies and chemotherapy.PMCID: PMC5833216PMID: 29472521
