The 8p11-12 region is a recurrent breakpoint areacharacterized by a sharp decrease in gains/amplifications and increase in allelicloss towards 8pter. However, the clustering of genomic aberrations in thisregion, even in the absence of proximal amplifications or distal LOH, suggeststhat the 8p11-12 region could play a pivotal role in oncogenesis.Results: Loss in the FGFR1 and ZNF703-containing 8p11 region was seen in 25% ofpatients, correlated with lower mRNA expression levels and independentlypredicted poor survival, particularly in systemic treatment-na√Øve patients andeven without adjacent 8p12 loss. Amplification of FGFR1 at 8p11 and loss ofDUSP26 and UNC5D, located in the 8p12 breakpoint region, independently predicted worse event free survival. Gains in the 8p12 region encompassing WRN, NRG1,DUSP26 and UNC5D, seen in 20-30% of patients, were associated with higher mRNAexpression and independently predicted chemotherapy sensitivity. Losses at 8p12independently predicted radiotherapy resistance.Material and methods: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was usedto investigate copy number aberrations at 8p11-12 in 234 female breast cancers.Alterations were correlated with clinicopathologic characteristics, survival and response to therapy. Results were validated using public METABRIC data.Conclusion: Allelic loss and amplification in the 8p11-12 breakpoint regionpredict poor survival and chemo- and radiotherapy response. Assessment of 8p11-12gene copy number status seems to augment existing prognostic and predictivetools.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24904 PMCID: PMC5908307PMID: 29682206
