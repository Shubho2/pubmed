Epub2018 Mar 27.Invasive Solid Papillary Carcinoma of the Nipple With Pagetoid Extension andNodal Metastasis.Domoto H(1), Watanabe A(1), Sakata M(1), Shimada A(1), Mukai K(1).Author information: (1)1 Keiyu Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.We report a case of invasive solid papillary carcinoma (SPC) of the nipple withPagetoid extension to the skin and lymph node metastasis. SPC is an uncommonprimary breast cancer accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancers. Only 2cases occurring in the nipple have been reported. However, both cases werewithout Pagetoid extension or lymph node metastasis. The presently reported tumorconsisted of irregularly shaped solid cell nests with delicate fibrovascularcores. The tumor cells had round nuclei with low-grade atypia and eosinophiliccytoplasm. Neuroendocrine differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemicalpositivity for CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. Immunohistochemistry alsoconfirmed the absence of myoepithelial cells around the tumor cell nests.Therefore, a diagnosis of invasive SPC was made. Additionally, tumor celldeposits in the intramammary and axillary lymph nodes were identified, and these deposits had the same histological characteristics as the invasive SPC of thenipple. The invasiveness of SPC can be difficult to determine. However, the tumorcell nests in the current case exhibited a retraction artifact, which is known tobe associated with invasive carcinoma and a poor prognosis, as well asmorphological patterns that have been previously identified as characteristic of invasive SPC. Although SPC is widely recognized as having a favorable outcome,the existence of exceptionally aggressive cases occurring in the nipple must berecognized. Additional cases of invasive SPC of the nipple are needed to analyze the clinicopathological correlation.DOI: 10.1177/1066896918766237 PMID: 29580118
