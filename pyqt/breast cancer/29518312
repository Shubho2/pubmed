Thelead compound 6e with excellent CDK4/9 and HDAC1 inhibitory activity of IC50 =8.8, 12, and 2.2 nM, respectively, can effectively induce apoptosis of cancercell lines. The kinase profiling of compound 6e showed excellent selectivity and specificity. Compound 6e induces G2/M arrest in high concentration and G0/G1arrest in low concentration to prevent the proliferation and differentiation ofcancer cells. Mice bared-breast cancer treated with 6e showed significantantitumor efficacy. The insight into mechanisms of 6e indicated that it couldinduce cancer cell death via cell apoptosis based on CDK4/9 and HDAC1 repression and phosphorylation of p53. Our data demonstrated the novel compound 6e could be a promising drug candidate for cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00209 PMID: 29518312
