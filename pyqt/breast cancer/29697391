Javakhishvili Tbilisi StateUniversity, A. Natishvili Institute of Morphology; Pathology Research Center;Tbilisi State Medical University, Georgia.(2)David Tvildiani Medical University; Iv. Javakhishvili Tbilisi StateUniversity.Aim of the study was the simultaneous assessment of EGFR and Cyclin E in"basal-like" carcinoma group, in order to establish their interactivity in theaspect of the age and grade of the tumor, taking into account the common parallelHER2+ samples. The study involved postoperative and/or biopsy material (paraffin blocks) of 237 patients from archived data, who were operated due to breastcancer (National Cancer Center of Tbilisi, 2008-2012 years). In TNBC group and"basal-like" tumor subgroup expression of ESFR, Cyclin E and Cytokeratins 5/6 and17 were shown advanced activity of processes and high dependence to patients age.Taking into account all above mentioned, the immunohistochemical profile of"basal-like" type of breast cancer is defined mostly by sensitivity tocytokeratins CK5,6/17 and EGFR. In addition, the defected synthesis and activity of the latter, which is actually observed in "basal-like" carcinoma, leads toincreased malignancy grade and mitotic activity, which creates the phenotypic andgroup characteristics for this type of carcinomas overall.PMID: 29697391
