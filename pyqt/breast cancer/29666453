China.zhimingshao@yahoo.com.To investigate the epidemiology, demographics and survival of mucinousadenocarcinomas (MACs), we identified 80,758 MAC patients in the Surveillance,Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The reported incidence of MACsebbed and flowed over time; however, a significant increase in reported annualage-adjusted incidences of MACs in the appendix, lung and bronchus was observedfrom 1981 to 2014. The demographics and outcomes of MACs differed by anatomicsites. MACs of the stomach had the largest percentage of poorly differentiated orundifferentiated tumors (41.2%), while MACs of the appendix and pancreas wereassociated with more advanced tumor stage (P < 0.001). MACs of the pancreas, lungand bronchus and stomach showed worse survival than other sites, despitelocalized, regional or distant stage (P < 0.001). In univariate and multivariate analysis, site, tumor grade, tumor stage, regional nodes, sex, race, surgery and year of diagnosis were identified as independent prognostic factors ofcancer-specific survival. In conclusion, the incidence of MACs of certainspecific sites, such as the appendix, lung and bronchus, is rapidly increasing.We also revealed a series of prognostic factors of MACs, including tumor sites,tumor grade and tumor stage, which may improve the current understanding of theclinical and biological patterns of MACs.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-24540-7 PMCID: PMC5904162PMID: 29666453
