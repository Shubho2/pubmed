Epub2018 Feb 22.Monomeric and Dimeric 68Ga-Labeled Bombesin Analogues for Positron EmissionTomography (PET) Imaging of Tumors Expressing Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptors(GRPrs).Liolios C, Buchmuller B, Bauder-Wüst U, Schäfer M, Leotta K, Haberkorn U(1), EderM(2), Kopka K.Author information: (1)Department of Nuclear Medicine , University of Heidelberg , Im NeuenheimerFeld 400 , 69120 Heidelberg , Germany.(2)Division of Radiopharmaceutical Development, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK)Freiburg, and Department of Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, MedicalCenter, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Straße 55 , 79106 Freiburg , Germany.The GRPr, highly expressed in prostate PCa and breast cancer BCa, is a promising target for the development of new PET radiotracers. The chelator HBED-CC ( N,N'-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]ethylenediamine- N, N'-diacetic acid) wascoupled to the bombesin peptides: HBED-C-BN(2-14) 1,HBED-CC-PEG2-[d-Tyr6,β-Ala11,Thi13,Nle14]-BN(6-14) 2,HBED-CC-Y-[d-Phe6,Sta13,Leu14]-BN(6-14) (Y = 4-amino-1-carboxymethylpiperidine)3, and HBED-CC-{PEG2-Y-[d-Phe6,Sta13,Leu14]-BN(6-14)}2 4 (homodimer). Compounds1-4 presented high binding affinities for GRPr (T47D, 0.56-3.51 nM; PC-3,2.12-4.68 nM). In PC-3 and T47D cells, agonists [68Ga]1 and [68Ga]2 were mainlyinternalized while antagonists [68Ga]3 and [68Ga]4 were surface bound.Cell-related radioactivity reached a maximum after 45 min, while tracer levelsfollowed GRPr expression (PC-3 > T47D > LNCaP > MDA-MB-231). [68Ga]4 showed thehighest cell-bound radioactivity (PC-3 and T47D). In vivo, tumor (PC-3) targetingfor [68Ga]3 and [68Ga]4 increased over time, with dynamic μPET showing clearertumors images at later time points. [68Ga]3 and [68Ga]4 can be consideredsuitable PET tracers for imaging PCa and BCa expressing GRPr.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01856 PMID: 29432691
