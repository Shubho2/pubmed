With the development of molecular magneticresonance imaging (MRI), early diagnosis via non-invasive imaging has becomepossible. In this study, gadopentetic acid (GA)-doped silica (Gd@SiO2) was first synthesized by a reverse microemulsion method, and amino and carboxyl groups werethen successively introduced onto the surface of this Gd@SiO2. After these steps,a monoclonal antibody (YPSMA-1) to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) was conjugated with carboxyl-modified Gd@SiO2 (Gd@SiO2-COOH) nanoparticles (NPs) bythe carbodiimide method. Gd@SiO2-Ab NPs were thus obtained as specific MRcontrast agents for PCa-targeted imaging. Transmission electron microscopy showedthat the Gd@SiO2-Ab NPs exhibited a dispersed spherical morphology with arelatively uniform size distribution. The Gd@SiO2-Ab NPs showed high stabilityand high the longitudinal relaxation rate (r1). Cell-targeting experimentsin vitro demonstrated the high potential of the synthesized NPs to target PSMAreceptor-positive PCa cells. In vitro cytotoxicity assays showed that theGd@SiO2-Ab NPs exhibited good biological safety. These results suggest that thesynthesized Gd@SiO2-Ab NPs have great potential as specific MR contrast agentsfor PSMA receptor-positive PCa cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
