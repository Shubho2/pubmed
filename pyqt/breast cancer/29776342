DNA methylation reflects thephenotypic identity of cells and recent data suggested that DNA methylationprofiles of T cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are altered in cancer progression.METHODS: We enrolled 19 females with stage 1 and 2, nine with stage 3 and 4 and 9age matched healthy women. T cells were isolated from peripheral blood andextracted DNA was subjected to Illumina 450 K DNA methylation array analysis. Rawdata was analyzed by BMIQ, ChAMP and ComBat followed by validation of identified genes by pyrosequencing.RESULTS: Analysis of data revealed ~ 10,000 sites that correlated with breastcancer progression and established a list of 89 CG sites that were highlycorrelated (p < 0.01, r > 0.7, r < - 0.7) with breast cancer progression. Thevast majority of these sites were hypomethylated and enriched in genes withfunctions in the immune system.CONCLUSIONS: The study points to the possibility of using DNA methylationsignatures as a noninvasive method for early detection of breast cancer and itsprogression which need to be tested in clinical studies.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4482-7 PMCID: PMC5960123PMID: 29776342
