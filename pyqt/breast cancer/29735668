When itcombines with its ligand B7 on dendritic cells, it inhibits the activity of the Tcells. The Bromo- and Extra-Terminal (BET) protein family includes proteins that regulate the expression of key oncogenes and antiapoptotic proteins. BETinhibitor (BETi) has been shown to reduce the expression of MYC by suppressingits transcription factors and to down-regulate the hypoxic transcriptome responseto VEGF-A. This paper develops a mathematical model of the treatment of cancer bycombination therapy of BETi and CTLA-4 inhibitor. The model shows that the twodrugs are positively correlated in the sense that the tumor volume decreases asthe dose of each of the drugs is increased. The model also considers the effectof the combined therapy on levels of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) andthe overexpression of TNF-Î±, which may predict gastrointestinal side effects ofthe combination.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1721559115 PMCID: PMC6003484 [Available on 2018-11-22]PMID: 29735668
