However, the clinical utility of this informationremains largely unexplored. Here, we present the results of the first eightpatients recruited into a clinical whole-genome sequencing (WGS) program in theUnited Kingdom. We performed PCR-free WGS of fresh frozen tumors and germline DNAat 75× and 30×, respectively, using the HiSeq2500 HTv4. Subtracted tumor VCFs andpaired germlines were subjected to comprehensive analysis of coding and noncodingregions, integration of germline with somatically acquired variants, and globalmutation signatures and pathway analyses. Results were classified into tiers and presented to a multidisciplinary tumor board. WGS results helped to clarify anuncertain histopathological diagnosis in one case, led to informed or supportedprognosis in two cases, leading to de-escalation of therapy in one, and indicatedpotential treatments in all eight. Overall 26 different tier 1 potentiallyclinically actionable findings were identified using WGS compared with sixSNVs/indels using routine targeted NGS. These initial results demonstrate thepotential of WGS to inform future diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment choice incancer and justify the systematic evaluation of the clinical utility of WGS inlarger cohorts of patients with cancer.© 2018 Schuh et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.DOI: 10.1101/mcs.a002279 PMCID: PMC5880257PMID: 29610388
