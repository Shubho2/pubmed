To access thestability of the investigated caffeine analogues, molecular dynamic simulationswere performed in NAMD 2.9 assuming CHARMM36 force field. To evaluate theantioxidant capacity of new compounds, three different antioxidant assays wereused, namely 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl free radical (DPPH•) scavengingactivity, ferrous ions (Fe2+) chelating activity, and Fe3+→Fe2+reducing ability. In vitro, the ability of new derivatives to protect human erythrocytes againstoxidative haemolysis induced by free radical from2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH) was estimated. Thecytotoxic activity was tested using MCF-7 breast cancer cells and humanerythrocytes. All compounds showed the antioxidant capacity depending mostly ontheir ferrous ions chelating activity. In the presence of AAPH, some derivatives were able to effectively inhibit the oxidative haemolysis. Two derivatives,namely 8-(methyl(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-amino)caffeine and8-(methyl(3-(methylamino)propyl)amino)caffeine, showed cytotoxic activity againstMCF-7 breast cancer cells but not against human erythrocytes. Therefore, it isconcluded that the selected di- and polyamine caffeine analogues, depending ontheir chemical structure, were able to minimise the oxidative stress and toinhibit the tumour cell growth. The confirmed antioxidant and cytotoxicproperties of some caffeine derivatives make them attractive for potentialapplications in food or pharmaceutical industries.DOI: 10.1080/10715762.2018.1467561 PMID: 29669446
