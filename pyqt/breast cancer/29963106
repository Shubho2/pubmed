The purpose of the current study was to characterize the expression of histone deacetylases-3 (HDAC3), amember of class I HDACs, and assess the clinical significance of HDAC3 in breast cancer.Methods: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis were used to examine messenger RNA and proteinexpression levels. The relationships between HDAC3 expression andclinicopathological variables were analyzed. MTT assays were used to detect cell proliferation. Glucose-uptake, lactate, adenosine triphosphate, and lactatedehydrogenase assays were employed to detect aerobic glycolysis. Chromatinimmunoprecipitation was used to detect microRNA-31 (miR-31) promoter binding.Results: Our data revealed that HDAC3 was upregulated in breast cancer tissuecompared with matched para-carcinoma tissues, and high levels of HDAC3 werepositively correlated with advanced TNM stage and N stage of cancer. Furthermore,overexpression of HDAC3 promoted breast cancer cell-proliferation and aerobicglycolysis. The functional involvement of HDAC3 was related in part to therepression of miR-31 transcription via decreased histone H3 acetylation at lysineK9 levels of the miR-31 promoter. Survival analysis revealed that the level ofHDAC3 was an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients.Conclusion: Our findings revealed that HDAC3 served as an oncogene that couldpromote cell proliferation and aerobic glycolysis and was predictive of a poorprognosis in breast cancer. HDAC3 participated in the cell proliferation ofbreast cancer, which may prove to be a pivotal epigenetic target against thisdevastating disease.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.112 PMCID: PMC6015978PMID: 29963106
