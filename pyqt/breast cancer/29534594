Probability of breast/ovarian cancerdevelopment is higher in individuals carrying a causative germline DNA variant inBRCA1 or BRCA2 gene responsible for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC).Although a major proportion of inherited breast/ovarian cancers are due to thementioned causal mutations, a number of new genes have emerged. Here we describe a rapid, multiplex and comprehensive approach for the detection of pathogenicvariants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes which most frequently occur in Slovak HBOCpopulation. Analysis comprises the combination of mutation specific methods.Fluorescent PCR amplification followed by fragment analysis for detection ofinsertions/deletions in exon 11 of BRCA1 gene. Second method is SNaPshot analysisfor detection of the most frequent missense and ins/del variants in exons 2, 5,13, 20 of BRCA1 and exons 11, 23 and 25 of BRCA2 gene. Altogether, we haveanalyzed 687 samples, 86 (12.5%) in group 1, which fulfilled indication criteria based on the positive family/personal history. Group 2 involved 601 (87.5%)cases, who did not meet the indication criteria and only the screening test wasrecommended. Using the combined approach, we have identified 47 mutated samples(6.8%), 40 in group 1 (46.5%) and 7 in group 2 (1.1%). However, the presentedscreening test would not provide complex results of BRCA1/2 gene analysis, itoffers testing accessible to a broader spectrum of individuals under thethreshold of indication for whole gene analysis. This approach may providevaluable information even in the NGS analysis era.DOI: 10.4149/neo_2018_170507N328 PMID: 29534594
