Hence, the need to develop improved therapies to prevent and treatmetastasis to the brain is becoming urgent. Recent studies in this area arebringing about some advanced progress on brain metastasis. It was concluded that the occurrence and poor prognosis of brain metastasis have been mostly attributedto the exclusion of anticancer drugs from the brain by the blood-brain barrier.And several highly potent new generation targeted drugs with enhanced CNSdistribution have been developed constantly. However, the noted "seed and soil"hypothesis also suggests that the outcome of metastasis depends on therelationship between unique tumor cells and the specific organ microenvironment. Moreover, increasing studies in multiple tumor types demonstrated that brainmetastasis has great molecular differences between primary tumors andextracranial metastasis to a large extent. Here, the authors summarized the most common malignancies that could lead to brain metastasis-lung cancer, breastcancer and melanoma and their related mutated factors. Only by comprehending adeeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms, more effective brain-specifictherapies will be developed for brain metastasis.Â© 2018 The Authors.
