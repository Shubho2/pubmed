Irradiation technology includesconformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy and a conventional two-dimensional onewith conventional fraction. Any acute radiation dermatitis was recorded and theinfluencing factors were analyzed at the end of the radiation treatment.Results: Radiotherapy-induced acute dermatitis in patients with breast-conservingsurgery was relatively mild. Among the 173 patients, 33 cases had no obviouschanges in the skin (grade 0); 121 cases had grade 1 skin reactions, manifestedas local dark erythema and dry peeling; 29 cases had grade 2 skin reactions,characterized by edema, hyperemia, or erosion part; no grade 3 cases of skinreactions were observed. The incidence of grade 0, grade 1, and grade 2 reactionsin all patients was 19.1%, 69.9%, and 11.0%, respectively. The severity of skinacute reaction is independent of the tumor sites, molecular subtypes, patients'age, and irradiation modalities, but it depends on the surgical types, fieldstreated, and planned total radiation. There is a trend favoring no chemotherapyover chemotherapy, though p-value is 0.074.Conclusion: Skin acute reaction in postoperative radiotherapy breast cancerpatients is generally common but mild, and there are quite a few patients whoneed interruption or cessation of the radiotherapy process. The patients need to be well informed and made aware that any skin reaction will likely be mild,especially for the breast-conserving patients.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S156066 PMCID: PMC5870630PMID: 29615841
