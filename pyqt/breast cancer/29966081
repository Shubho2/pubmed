Disruption ofmitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis has been reported as an effective antitumorstrategy, while how to contribute to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload effectively is acritical issue. To solve this issue, we designed and engineered a dual enhancedCa2+ nanogenerator (DECaNG), which can induce elevation of intracellular Ca2+through the following three ways: Calcium phosphate (CaP)-doped hollow mesoporouscopper sulfide was the basic Ca2+ nanogenerator to generate Ca2+ directly andpersistently in the lysosomes (low pH). Near-infrared light radiation (NIR, such as 808 nm laser) can accelerate Ca2+ generation from the basic Ca2+ nanogeneratorby disturbing the crystal lattice of hollow mesoporous copper sulfide viaNIR-induced heat. Curcumin can facilitate Ca2+ release from the endoplasmicreticulum to cytoplasm and inhibit expelling of Ca2+ in cytoplasm through thecytoplasmic membrane. The in vitro study showed that DECaNG could produce a largeamount of Ca2+ directly and persistently to flow to mitochondria, leading toupregulation of Caspase-3, cytochrome c,Â and downregulation of Bcl-2 and ATPfollowed by cell apoptosis. In addition, DECaNG had an outstanding photothermaleffect. Interestingly, it was found that DECaNG exerted a stronger photothermaleffect at lower pH due to the super small nanoparticles effect, thus enhancingphotothermal therapy. In the in vivo study, the nanoplatform had good tumortargeting and treatment efficacy via a combination of disruption of mitochondrialCa2+ homeostasis and photothermal therapy. The metabolism of CaNG was sped upthrough disintegration of CaNG into smaller nanoparticles, reducing the retentiontime of the nanoplatform in vivo. Therefore, DECaNG can be a promising drugdelivery system for breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.8b02034 PMID: 29966081
