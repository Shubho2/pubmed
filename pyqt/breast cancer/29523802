The structure differences were located at C-3″″'. The cytotoxic activity of polygonumins A was evaluated on several cancer cell lines by a cell viability assay usingtetrazolium dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide(MTT). The compound showed the highest antiproliferative (p < 0.05) activitiesagainst K562 (Human Leukaemia Cell Line), MCF7 (Human breast adenocarcinoma cell line), and HCT116 (Colorectal cancer cells) cells. Cytotoxic studies againstV79-4 cells were carried out and showed that polygonumins A was toxic at50 µg/ml, suggesting that this compound may be used as an anticancer drug withoutaffecting normal cells. Polygonumins A also showed promising activity as an HIV-1protease inhibitor with 56% relative inhibition. Molecular docking resultsindicated that the compound possesses high binding affinity towards the HIVprotease over the low binding free energy range of -10.5 to -11.3 kcal/mol. P.minus is used in Malaysian traditional medicine for the treatment of tumourcells. This is the first report on the use of P. minus as an HIV-1 proteaseinhibitor.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22485-5 PMCID: PMC5845017PMID: 29523802
