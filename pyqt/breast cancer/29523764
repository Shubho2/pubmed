Previously, we observed that S1P is exported out of human breastcancer cells by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCC1, but not by ABCB1,both known multidrug resistance proteins that efflux chemotherapeutic agents.However, the pathologic consequences of these events to breast cancer progressionand metastasis have not been elucidated. Here, it is demonstrated that highexpression of ABCC1, but not ABCB1, is associated with poor prognosis in breastcancer patients. Overexpression of ABCC1, but not ABCB1, in human MCF7 and murine4T1 breast cancer cells enhanced S1P secretion, proliferation, and migration ofbreast cancer cells. Implantation of breast cancer cells overexpressing ABCC1,but not ABCB1, into the mammary fat pad markedly enhanced tumor growth,angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis with a concomitant increase in lymph node andlung metastases as well as shorter survival of mice. Interestingly, S1P exported via ABCC1 from breast cancer cells upregulated transcription of sphingosinekinase 1 (SPHK1), thus promoting more S1P formation. Finally, patients withbreast cancers that express both activated SPHK1 and ABCC1 have significantlyshorter disease-free survival. These findings suggest that export of S1P viaABCC1 functions in a malicious feed-forward manner to amplify the S1P axisinvolved in breast cancer progression and metastasis, which has importantimplications for prognosis of breast cancer patients and for potentialtherapeutic targets.Implication: Multidrug resistant transporter ABCC1 andactivation of SPHK1 in breast cancer worsen patient's survival by export of S1Pto the tumor microenvironment to enhance key processes involved in cancerprogression.
