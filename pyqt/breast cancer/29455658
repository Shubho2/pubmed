Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) constitute a class of receptors that play important role in cancer progression. RTKs are cell surface receptorswith specialized structural and biological features which respond toenvironmental cues by initiating appropriate signaling cascades in tumor cells.RTKs are known to regulate various downstream signaling pathways such as MAPK,PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT. These pathways have a pivotal role in the regulation ofcancer stemness, angiogenesis and metastasis. These pathways are also imperative for a reciprocal interaction of tumor and stromal cells. Multi-faceted role ofRTKs renders them amenable to therapy in breast cancer. However, structuralmutations, gene amplification and alternate pathway activation pose challenges toanti-RTK therapy.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0797-x PMCID: PMC5817867PMID: 29455658
