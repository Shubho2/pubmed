This paper characterizes the role of an inflammatorycytokine, oncostatin M (OSM), in the preintravasation aspects of breast cancermetastasis.METHODS: OSM expression levels in human breast cancer tissue samples wereassessed using tissue microarrays, and expression patterns based on clinicalstage were assessed. To determine the in vivo role of OSM in breast cancermetastasis to the lung, we used three orthotopic breast cancer mouse models,including a syngeneic 4T1.2 mouse mammary cancer model, the MDA-MB-231 humanbreast cancer xenograft model, and an OSM-knockout (OSM-KO) mouse model.Progression of metastatic disease was tracked by magnetic resonance imaging andbioluminescence imaging. Endpoint analysis included circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts, lung metastatic burden analysis by qPCR, and ex vivo bioluminescenceimaging.RESULTS: Using tissue microarrays, we found that tumor cell OSM was expressed at the highest levels in ductal carcinoma in situ. This finding suggests that OSMmay function during the earlier steps of breast cancer metastasis. In micebearing MDA-MB-231-Luc2 xenograft tumors, peritumoral injection of recombinanthuman OSM not only increased metastases to the lung and decreased survival butalso increased CTC numbers. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a gp130family inflammatory cytokine has been shown to directly affect CTC numbers. Usinga 4T1.2 syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer, we found that mice bearing4T1.2-shOSM tumors with knocked down tumor expression of OSM had reduced CTCs,decreased lung metastatic burden, and increased survival compared with micebearing control tumors. CTC numbers were further reduced in OSM-KO mice bearingthe same tumors, demonstrating the importance of both paracrine- andautocrine-produced OSM in this process. In vitro studies further supported thehypothesis that OSM promotes preintravasation aspects of cancer metastasis,because OSM induced both 4T1.2 tumor cell detachment and migration.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings suggest that OSM plays a crucial role in the early steps of metastatic breast cancer progression, resulting in increasedCTCs and lung metastases as well as reduced survival. Therefore, earlytherapeutic inhibition of OSM in patients with breast cancer may prevent breastcancer metastasis.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0971-5 PMCID: PMC6001163PMID: 29898744
