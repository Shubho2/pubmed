Yet, the clinicopathologic andprognostic significance of these markers remain unclear. In this study, we haveinvestigated the expression of these markers and their relation with conventionalclinicopathologic tumor characteristic including molecular subtype.METHODS: CD44 and ALDH1 expression were investigated by immunohistochemistry in aseries of 157 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues.RESULTS: Overall, CD44 and ALDH1 are, respectively, detected in 33% (52 of 157)and 7% (10 of 157) of breast cancer cases. We also observed that CD44 expression was associated with histological grade (p = 0.005). For ALDH1, we found that its expression is more frequent with elderly women (> 50 years, p = 0.03). Theinvestigation of relationship between the stem cell phenotype and breast cancermolecular subtype, revealed that CD44 and ALDH1 expression was more frequent inbasal-like tumors (p = 0.005). Among the two cancer stem cell markers tested,ALDH1 showed a strong association with the basal marker EGFR (p = 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CD44 and ALDH1 play a role in theclinical behavior in breast cancer and might be interesting biomarkers andtherapeutic targets.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0875-3 PMID: 29845398
