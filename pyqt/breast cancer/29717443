IndPCR, DNA is portioned into many discrete single entities, and these are analyzedindividually for the presence or absence of a target molecule of interest. Herewe describe how digital PCR can be employed to determine the presence ofoncogenic amplification through noninvasive analysis of circulating free DNA(cfDNA), and exemplify this approach by developing a plasma circulating free DNA dPCR assay for HER2 copy number.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7778-9_10 PMID: 29717443
