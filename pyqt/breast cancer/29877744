There is limited research into thepathophysiology and management of ULMI. Care is provided in different health-carecontexts by specialist and nonspecialist physiotherapists, with referrals set to increase. This study explores physiotherapists' experiences of managing ULMI.DESIGN: Qualitative study using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach.METHOD: We interviewed six physiotherapists from various UK treatment settings.The data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis.FINDINGS: Four master themes were identified: (1) lack of confidence surroundsvarious aspects of practice, influenced by limited evidence to guide treatment ofULMI, fear of causing harm, and working in a less-established area ofphysiotherapy; (2) increasing confidence in practice develops with experience,reinforcing perceptions of the benefits of physiotherapy; (3) physiotherapy isunderstood to empower and enable patients to regain their sense of self andquality of life; and (4) provision of care is perceived to be subject to manybarriers.CONCLUSION: Physiotherapy for ULMI has professional challenges but is seen asbeneficial, encompassing psychosocial and physical effects. Experiences in thisarea of practice suggest a need for increased professional support, furtherresearch to guide treatment, and better patient and health professional awarenessof ULMI and the role of physiotherapy.DOI: 10.1080/09593985.2018.1480077 PMID: 29877744
