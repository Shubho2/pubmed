Our present study reveals that an industrial chemical, bisphenolS (BPS), can promote the migration, but not the proliferation, of TNBC cells invitro. BPS activates YAP, a key effector of Hippo pathway, by inhibiting itsphosphorylation, which promotes YAP nuclear accumulation and up-regulates itsdownstream genes such as CTGF and ANKRD1. Inhibition of YAP blocks theBPS-triggered cell migration and up-regulation of fibronectin (FN) and vimentin(Vim). BPS rapidly decreases the phosphorylation levels of LATS1 (Ser909) in TNBCcells, which regulates the activation and functions of YAP. Silencing LATS1/2 by siRNA increases BPS-induced dephosphorylation of YAP and extended the half-lifeof YAP protein. Inhibition of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) andits downstream PLCβ/PKC signals attenuate the effects of BPS-induced YAPdephosphorylation and CTGF up-regulation. Targeted inhibition of GPER/YAPinhibits BPS-induced migration of TNBC cells. Collectively, we reveal thatGPER/Hippo-YAP signal is involved in BPS-induced migration of TNBC cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
