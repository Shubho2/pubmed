But theweakly differential expression signals between two phenotypes are hardlydetectable with limited sample sizes. To solve this problem, many researcherstried to combine multiple independent datasets using meta-analysis or batcheffect adjustment algorithms. However, these algorithms may distort truebiological differences between two phenotypes and introduce unacceptable highfalse rates, as demonstrated in this study. These problems pose criticalobstacles for analyzing the transcriptional data in The Cancer Genome Atlas wherethere are many small-scale batches of data. Previously, we developed RankComp to detect DEGs for individual disease samples through exploiting the incongruousrelative expression orderings between two phenotypes and further improved it hereto identify DEGs using multiple independent datasets. We demonstrated theimproved RankComp can directly analyze integrated cross-site data to detect DEGs between two phenotypes without the need of batch effect adjustments. Its usagewas illustrated in detecting weak differential expression signals of breastcancer drug-response data using combined datasets from multiple experiments.DOI: 10.7150/ijbs.24548 PMCID: PMC6036750PMID: 29989020
