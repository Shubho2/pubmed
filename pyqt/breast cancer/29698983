Exercise has a well-accepted role in themulti-disciplinary approach to rehabilitating breast cancer survivors. Despitethe many known benefits of resistance training on women recovering from breastcancer, the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. MicroRNAs are smallnon-coding RNAs that have crucial roles in growth and development. Here, weanalysed the abundance of 9 miRNAs, with known roles in muscle physiology andsome linked to cancer, in serum samples from 24 breast cancer survivors beforeand after a 16-week resistance training or usual care intervention. Theresistance training group completed supervised thrice-weekly training. miRNAabundance was assessed before and after the intervention period using qPCR. Therewere no statistically significant changes in any of the miRNAs between groupsafter the intervention period (all p>0.05). After assessing miRNA abundance incontext with high and low responders to resistance training, we observed thatrelative to low responders, high responders exhibited increased miR-133a-3p and aborderline statistically significant increase in miR-370-3p. Findings from ourcontrolled study indicate the diverse interindividual miRNA responses toresistance training and reveal a discordant regulation between high and lowresponders.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.DOI: 10.1055/a-0592-7691 PMID: 29698983  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
