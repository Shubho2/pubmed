In tumours, oxygen levels vary and hypoxic regions exist within agenerally well-oxygenated tumour. However, whilst the heterogeneous environmentis known to contribute to metastatic progression, little is known about themechanism by which heterogeneic hypoxia contributes to cancer progression. Thisis largely because existing experimental models do not recapitulate theheterogeneous nature of hypoxia. The primary effector of the hypoxic response is the transcription factor Hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1-alpha).HIF1-alpha is stabilised in response to low oxygen levels in the cellularenvironment and its expression is seen in hypoxic regions throughout the tumour.METHODS: We have developed a model system in which HIF1-alpha can be inducedwithin a sub-population of cancer cells, thus enabling us to mimic the effects ofheterogeneic HIF1-alpha expression.RESULTS: We show that induction of HIF1-alpha not only recapitulates elements of the hypoxic response in the induced cells but also results in significant changesin proliferation, gene expression and mammosphere formation within the HIF1-alphanegative population.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the HIF1-alpha expressing cells foundwithin hypoxic regions are likely to contribute to the subsequent progression of a tumour by modifying the behaviour of cells in the non-hypoxic regions of thelocal micro-environment.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4577-1 PMCID: PMC6011406PMID: 29925335
