Unfortunately systemicchemotherapy has limited tumor response due to LMs are supplied by hepaticartery. Hepatic intra-arterial (HAI) have antitumor activity in pretreatedpatients with LMs. Here we report the case of a 55-year-old woman affected byBCLPD and heavily pretreated. LMs responded to treatment based on HAI with5-fluorouracil and nab-paclitaxel systemic chemotherapy, and they completelydisappeared on a CT-scan. We conclude that this combination chemotherapy is safe and may be very useful for the treatment of patients with BCLPD. Therefore, this combination should be evaluated in a large study.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23793 PMCID: PMC5814293PMID: 29487726
