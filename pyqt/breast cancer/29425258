Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in IBCs hasbeen understudied.Methods: In this study, tissue microarrays of 68 IBCs were immunostained with aPD-L1 antibody using an antibody clone (28-8) and detection system approved bythe US Food and Drug Administration for selecting patients with non-small celllung cancer and melanoma for anti-PD-L1 therapy.Results: Positive PD-L1 expression was found in 25 (36.8%) of 68 samples but was not significantly associated with the clinicopathologic variables examined.Univariate analysis of overall survival (OS) revealed that worse OS wassignificantly associated with positive PD-L1, negative estrogen receptor, andtriple-negative status. The 5-year OS rate was 36.4% for patients withPD-L1-positive IBC and 47.3% for those with PD-L1-negative IBC. In multivariateanalyses, PD-L1 status remained a statistically independent predictor of OS.Conclusions: These findings indicate that PD-L1 inhibitors could potentiallyimprove the clinical outcome of patients with PD-L1-positive IBC.Â© American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2018.
