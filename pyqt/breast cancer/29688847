Currently, some 30-40% of the patients treated with breast conservingsurgery (BCS) are dissatisfied with their final cosmetic result. In order toprevent disturbing breast deformity oncoplastic surgical techniques have beenintroduced. The extent of different levels of oncoplastic surgery incorporated inbreast conserving surgery and its value with regard to cosmetic outcome, patient satisfaction and quality of life remains to be defined. The aim of thisprospective cohort study is to investigate quality of life and satisfaction with cosmetic result in patients with breast cancer, undergoing standard lumpectomyversus level I or II oncoplastic breast conserving surgery.METHODS: Female breast cancer patients scheduled for BCS, from 18 years of age,referred to our outpatient clinic from July 2015 are asked to participate in thisstudy. General, oncologic and treatment information will be collected. Patientsatisfaction will be scored preceding surgery, and at 1 month and 1 year followup. Photographs of the breast will be used to score cosmetic result both by thepatient, an independent expert panel and BCCT.Core software. Quality of life willbe measured by using the BREAST-Q BCT, EORTC-QLQ and EQ-5D-5 L questionnaires.DISCUSSION: The purpose of this prospective study is to determine the clinicalvalue of different levels of oncoplastic techniques in breast conserving surgery,with regard to quality of life and cosmetic result. Analysis will be carried out by objective measurements of the final cosmetic result in comparison withstandard breast conserving surgery. The results of this study will be used todevelopment of a clinical decision model to guide the use oncoplastic surgery in future BCS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Central Commission of Human Research (CCMO), The Netherlands:NL54888.015.15.
