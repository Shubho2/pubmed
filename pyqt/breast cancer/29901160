China.Trop2 is considered to have an important function in tumor metastasis and thepromotion of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT). E‑cadherin is a crucialfactor in intercellular adhesion and EMT transformation. In the present study, wedetected the expression of Trop2 and E‑cadherin in breast cancer (BC) to betterdefine their prognostic value. The mRNA expression levels of these two genes in20 cases of fresh BC tissues were detected by quantitative real‑time polymerasechain reaction (qRT‑PCR). We also detected the expression levels of these twogenes by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 312 BC tissues, and the correlationsbetween the expression of these two genes and the clinicopathologicalcharacteristics in BC patients were analyzed. The mRNA and protein expressionlevels of the two genes in BC cell lines were studied by qRT‑PCR and westernblotting. The results indicated that Trop2+/E‑cadherin‑ was expressed in BCtissues more than that in the matched adjacent tissues. The protein expressionresults obtained via IHC were similar to the mRNA expression results.Trop2+/E‑cadherin‑ that was expressed in BC was associated with lymph nodestatus, metastasis, tumor‑node‑metastasis (TNM) stage, and ER‑/PR‑/HER2‑expression. BC patients that expressed Trop2+/E‑cadherin‑ had poor overallsurvival rates. The results of Trop2 and E‑cadherin expression levels obtained inthe BC cell lines were the same as those obtained in the BC tissues. Overall,Trop2 has a potential role in the promotion of EMT in BC and it could beconsidered as a therapeutic target in the future.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6496 PMID: 29901160
