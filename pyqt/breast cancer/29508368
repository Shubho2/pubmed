Box 9600, 2300 RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.The BOADICEA breast cancer (BC) risk assessment model and its associated WebApplication v3 (BWA) tool are being extended to incorporate additional geneticand non-genetic BC risk factors. From an online survey through the BOADICEAwebsite and UK, Dutch, French and Swedish national genetic societies, we exploredthe relationships between the usage frequencies of the BWA and six other commonBC risk assessment tools and respondents' perceived importance of BC riskfactors. Respondents (N = 443) varied in age, country and clinical seniority but comprised mainly genetics health professionals (82%) and BWA users (93%).Oncology professionals perceived reproductive, hormonal (exogenous) and lifestyleBC risk factors as more important in BC risk assessment compared to geneticsprofessionals (p values < 0.05 to 0.0001). BWA was used more frequently byrespondents who gave high weight to breast tumour pathology and low weight topersonal BC history as BC risk factors. BWA use was positively related to theweight given to hormonal BC risk factors. The importance attributed to lifestyle and BMI BC risk factors was not associated with the use of BWA or any of theother tools. Next version of the BWA encompassing additional BC risk factors willfacilitate more comprehensive BC risk assessment in genetics and oncologypractice.DOI: 10.1007/s12687-018-0362-8 PMID: 29508368
