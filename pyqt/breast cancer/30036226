[Epub aheadof print]When Ovarian Cancer Is Not: Characterizing Nonovarian Cancer Pathology in aLaparoscopy-Based Triage System.Dood RL(1), Fleming ND, Coleman RL, Westin SN, Lara OD, LaFargue CJ, Liu J, Sood AK.Author information: (1)The Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine, Universityof Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.OBJECTIVE: Establishing an accurate histologic diagnosis is essential fordetermining the appropriate course of therapy for ovarian cancer. This studysought to investigate and describe nonovarian cancer pathologies discoveredduring the systematic laparoscopic workup of presumed advanced ovarian cancer.METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with presumed advanced ovarian cancer(based on elevated CA125 and/or imaging) presenting to our center withoutconfirmed pathologic diagnosis were identified and characterized. Patientswithout ovarian cancer on final pathology were described and compared with those with confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer using standard statistical methods.RESULTS: Nonovarian cancer was found in 26 (7.1%) of 365 cases over 3.5 years of study, and included benign ovarian pathology, and metastatic uterine, breast, andgastrointestinal cancers. Most nonovarian cancer cases could not be diagnosedwith percutaneous biopsy, and instead used diagnostic laparoscopy or assessmentat the time of laparotomy for diagnosis (58%). No patient received inappropriate treatment. Nonovarian cancer cases were more likely to be nonwhite (P = 0.003),have a better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (P < 0.001), and have a lower CA125 value (P < 0.001), and were less likely to have pleuraleffusions (P = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: A systematic laparoscopic triage approach to advanced-stage ovarian cancer eliminates incorrect neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration andinappropriate laparotomy. This algorithm identified a population of women who aremore likely to have nonovarian cancer pathology. Increasing screening effortsshould be focused on conclusive diagnosis with the least invasive testingpossible.DOI: 10.1097/IGC.0000000000001329 PMID: 30036226
