Seven patients were excluded from the final analysis dueto their refusal to consent. The patients were assessed by using EuropeanOrganization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life-BR23questionnaire module (which incorporates five multi-item and three single itemsscales) at 1st visit (0 month), 6, 12, and 24 months interval, respectively.Results: The symptom scores and future perspectives scale showed improvement withtime, but body image and sexual functioning and enjoyment scales showed thedeteriorating trend. P < 0.05 was considered as significant.Conclusion: The female breast cancer survivors failed to improve their bodyimage, sexual functioning, and sexual enjoyment scales but did well in other BR23scales. Besides the family and spousal/marital support these patients got closer to their religion which has been seen to influence their psychosocial well-being optimistically and need further studies to establish the role of religiouspractices/beliefs.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.165867 PMID: 29893309
