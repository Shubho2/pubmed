In ER negative breast cancer the MGMT promoter isfrequently methylated. In ER positive breast cancer MGMT is upregulated andmodulates ER function. Here, we evaluate MGMT's role in control of otherclinically relevant targets involved in cell cycle regulation during breastcancer oncogenesis. We show that O6-benzylguanine (BG), an MGMT inhibitordecreases CDC2, CDC20, TOP2A, AURKB, KIF20A, cyclin B2, A2, D1, ERα and survivin and induces c-PARP and p21 and sensitizes ER positive breast cancer totemozolomide (TMZ). Further, siRNA inhibition of MGMT inhibits CDC2, TOP2A,AURKB, KIF20A, Cyclin B2, A2 and survivin and induces p21. Combination of BG+TMZ decreases CDC2, CDC20, TOP2A, AURKB, KIF20A, Cyclin A2, B2, D1, ERα and survivin.Temozolomide alone inhibits MGMT expression in a dose and time dependent mannerand increases p21 and cytochrome c. Temozolomide inhibits transcription of TOP2A,AURKB, KIF20A and does not have any effect on CDC2 and CDC20 and induces p21.BG+/-TMZ inhibits breast cancer growth. In our orthotopic ER positive breastcancer xenografts, BG+/-TMZ decreases ki-67, CDC2, CDC20, TOP2A, AURKB andinduces p21 expression. In the same model, BG+TMZ combination inhibits breasttumor growth in vivo compared to single agent (TMZ or BG) or control. Our resultsshow that MGMT inhibition is relevant for inhibition of multiple downstreamtargets involved in tumorigenesis. We also show that MGMT inhibition increases ERpositive breast cancer sensitivity to alkylator based chemotherapy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25696 PMCID: PMC6049872PMID: 30038716
