T2, DWI, and DCE sequences were analyzed and maps weregenerated for Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), T2 signal intensity, and the following dynamic parameters: k-trans, peak enhancement, area under curve (AUC), time to maximal enhancement (TME), wash-in rate, and washout rate. Volumetricanalysis of these parameters was performed, yielding a histogram analysisincluding first-order texture kinetics (percentiles, maximum value, minimumvalue, range, standard deviation, mean, median, mode, skewness, and kurtosis).Finally, correlations between these values and response to NAC (evaluated on the surgical specimen according to RECIST 1.1 criteria) were assessed.Results: Out of 69 tumors, 33 (47.8%) achieved complete pathological response, 26(37.7%) partial response, and 10 (14.5%) no response. Higher levels of AUCmax (p value = 0.0338), AUCrange (p value = 0.0311), and TME75 (p value = 0.0452) andlower levels of washout10 (p value = 0.0417), washout20 (p value = 0.0138),washout25 (p value = 0.0114), and washout30 (p value = 0.05) were predictive ofnoncomplete response.Conclusion: Histogram-derived texture analysis of MRI images allows findingquantitative parameters predictive of nonresponse to NAC in women affected bylocally advanced BC.DOI: 10.1155/2018/8329041 PMCID: PMC5960544PMID: 29853811
