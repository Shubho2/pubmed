After a loading dose of 8mg/kg trastuzumab was administered intravenously on day 1 of the first cycle;serum samples were obtained at 0, 1.5 (end of IP infusion), 3, 6, 8, 24, 96, 168,and 336 h after the first infusion for the first cycle only. Cmax and AUC0-336were calculated for a single dose. Stage II enrolled a total of 106 patientsacross 20 centers who were randomized to receive biosimilar trastuzumab (studytrastuzumab) or the reference trastuzumab with paclitaxel. The primary endpointof the objective response rate (ORR) was analyzed after last the dosedparticipant had completed 25-week evaluation. The secondary outcome measuresincluded time to tumor progression, progression-free survival and overallsurvival at week 48, and safety evaluation.RESULTS: For reference and study trastuzumab products, mean Cmax of 229.02 and210.68 μg/mL and AUC0-336 of 24298.29 and 25809.33 (μg × h/mL), respectively,were obtained. The efficacy results demonstrated that study trastuzumab andreference trastuzumab had comparable ORR (48.44% vs. 44.44%). The proportions of participants showing complete response and partial response in each arm werefound to be comparable. There were 56 (68.29%) participants in the study arm and 13 (59.09%) participants in the reference arm who had at least one adverse event during the study. Immunogenicity assessment also revealed no participants withpositive antibody titer in any of the study arms.CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics, overall response rate at 25 weeks, and safetyof the biosimilar trastuzumab was comparable to the reference trastuzumab.DOI: 10.4103/ijc.IJC_449_17 PMID: 30082554
