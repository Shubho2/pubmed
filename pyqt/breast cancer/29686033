Gerstner, Jr. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065.BRCA2 is a breast and ovarian tumor suppressor that guards against genomeinstability, a hallmark of cancer. Significant progress has been made inimproving our understanding of BRCA2 function from biochemical, cellular, andmouse studies. The knowledge gained has been actively exploited to developtherapeutic strategies, including PARP inhibition, which has shown promisingclinical outcomes. Recently, tremendous excitement has been generated by thefindings of the roles of BRCA2 and other proteins in suppressing replicationstress through homologous recombination and in the protection of stalledreplication forks. Processes such as mitotic DNA synthesis and fork reversal havetaken center stage in these studies. Here, we discuss our recent findings in the context of these advances.Â© 2017 Feng and Jasin; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.DOI: 10.1101/sqb.2017.82.035006 PMID: 29686033
