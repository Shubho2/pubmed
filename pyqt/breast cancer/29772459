An increased risk ofbrain metastases is also seen in patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer administered curative therapy. Brain metastases in HER2-positive breast cancerpatients usually constitute the first site of recurrence. The administration ofanti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, trastuzumab and pertuzumab, considerably delays the onset of symptomatic brain disease: however, the limited penetration of thesecompounds into the CNS hinders their efficacy. The small-molecule tyrosine kinaseinhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptors family have established activity in HER2-positive breast cancer in both advanced disease and neoadjuvant setting. Favorable physico-chemical properties of these compounds allow them for a moreefficient penetration through the blood-brain barrier, and hold the promise formore effective prevention and treatment of brain metastases. In this article wereview the role of currently available or investigational HER2 tyrosine kinaseinhibitors: lapatinib, neratinib, afatinib and tucatinib in the treatment ofbrain metastases in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
