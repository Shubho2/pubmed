Consequently, we investigated the role of glucocorticoids in ductalcarcinoma in situ (DCIS) in breast cancer, focusing specially on myoepithelialcells.METHODS: To clarify the role of glucocorticoids at breast cancer onset, weevaluated the effects of cortisol and corticosterone on epithelial andmyoepithelial cells using 2D and 3D in vitro and in vivo approaches and humansamples.RESULTS: Glucocorticoids induce a reduction in laminin levels and favour thedisruption of the basement membrane by promotion of myoepithelial cell apoptosis in vitro. In an in vivo stress murine model, increased corticosterone levelsfostered the transition from DCIS to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) viamyoepithelial cell apoptosis and disappearance of the basement membrane. RU486 isable to partially block the effects of cortisol in vitro and in vivo. We foundthat myoepithelial cell apoptosis is more frequent in patients with DCIS+IDC thanin patients with DCIS.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that physiological stress, through increasedglucocorticoid blood levels, promotes the transition from DCIS to IDC,particularly by inducing myoepithelial cell apoptosis. Since this would be aprerequisite for invasive features in patients with DCIS breast cancer, itsclinical management could help to prevent breast cancer progression to IDC.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0977-z PMCID: PMC6032539PMID: 29973218
