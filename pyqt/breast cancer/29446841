Epub 2018 Feb 15.The connection between the breast and heart in a woman: Breast cancer andcardiovascular disease.Gulati M(1), Mulvagh SL(2).Author information: (1)Division of Cardiology, University of Arizona-Phoenix, Phoenix, Arizona.(2)Division of Cardiology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in women in the United States and is a major public health issue for all women, but it is of increasing concern to breast cancer survivors. Advancements in early detection and breastcancer therapy have resulted in over 90% of women surviving 5 years past theirdiagnosis of breast cancer. Nonetheless, with increased survivorship from breast cancer, there has been an increase in cardiovascular disease in these women. The consequences of the treatments for breast cancer may increase the risk forcardiovascular disease. Additionally, there is an overlap of risk factors common to both breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. The increased risk ofcardiovascular disease in women who survive breast cancer must be recognized,with a focus on the prevention and early detection of cardiovascular disease.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/clc.22886 PMID: 29446841
