Given that the tumor cellsundergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) often gain malignant andinvasive features, we have investigated the possibility of EMT reversal intriple-negative breast cancer cells by targeting the epigenetic-modifyingenzymatic complexes named histone deacetylases (HDACs) and examined the possible mechanism underlying the HDACs-based inversion in model MDA-MB-231 cells. Cellswere treated with a maximal tolerable 200 nM concentrations of classical HDACsinhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) for 48 h and afterwards the invasiveness andimmigration of the cells were evaluated in TransWell Invasion Scratch WoundHealing assays. Then, in treated and control cells, quantitative real time-PCRreacions were performed for assessing the gene expression of EMT biomarkersE-cadherin, Vimentin and transcriptional factor Slug. After TSA treatment, theinvasion and migration properties MDA-MB-231 cells significantly decreased, gene expression of E-cadherin was significantly up-regulated, while the levels of Slugand Vimentin encoding mRNAs were suppressed. We conclude that inhibition of HDACsin triple-negative breast cancer cells may lead to inversion of EMT and thedecrease of invasiveness by down-regulating the gene expression of Slug. SinceEMT is known as a pre-metastatic process, triple-negative breast tumors, the EMT reversal effects of HDACs inhibition may reduce tumor cell metastasis.DOI: 10.7868/S0026898418030102 PMID: 29989579
