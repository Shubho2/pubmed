Whereasgranulocytic-MDSCs correlate with poor overall survival in breast cancer (BC),the presence and relevance of monocytic (Mo)-MDSCs are unknown. Here, we reportfor the first time increased chemokine and chemokine receptor production byMo-MDSCs in BC patients. A clear population of Mo-MDSCs with the typical cellsurface phenotype (human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related [HLA-DR]low/- CD11b+CD33+ CD14+) increased significantly during disease progression. In addition, thechemokine receptor expression level on Mo-MDSCs in patients with invasive BC was the highest. Furthermore, different chemokine receptor expression patterns werenoted in Mo-MDSCs between healthy controls (HC) and BC patients. Additionally,CD4 T cells proliferations were significantly decreased in the invasive BC groupscompared with the HC group. However, the ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) grouphad no significantly compared with the HC group. Our data suggest that monitoringchemokine and chemokine receptor production by Mo-MDSCs may represent a novel andsimple biomarker for assessing disease progression in BC patients.DOI: 10.4110/in.2018.18.e23 PMCID: PMC6026688PMID: 29984041
