Electronic address: kspark@cha.ac.kr.GATA3 is a master regulator that drives mammary epithelial cell differentiation, and the suppression of GATA3 expression is associated with the development ofaggressive breast cancer. However, the mechanism through which GATA3 loss drives cancer development is poorly understood. Previously, we reported that ELK3suppression in MDA-MB-231 (ELK3 KD) resulted in the reprogramming of these cells from a basal to luminal subtype, which was associated with the induction of GATA3expression, and that the ELK3-GATA3 axis orchestrated the metastaticcharacteristics of MDA-MB-231. Here, we show that GATA3 suppression in ELK3knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells (ELK3/GATA3 DKD) restores the metastatic abilitycomparably to that of control MDA-MB-231 cells, even though the epithelial cellmorphology and TGF-β signaling of ELK3 KD are not recovered in ELK3/GATA3 DKD.The expression of E-cadherin and tight junctional proteins, including occludin,claudin and ZO-1, which is activated in ELK3 KD, is suppressed in ELK3/GATA3 DKD.These results reveal the possibility that the ELK3-GATA3 axis determines themetastatic characteristics of MDA-MB-231 by regulating the expression ofcell-cell adhesion factors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
