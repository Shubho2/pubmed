W. GoetheUniversity, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.An innovative template, based on thoracic cage surface reconstructions for breastinterstitial brachytherapy was developed.Hybrid-inverse-planning-optimisation-based implantations and brachytherapy plans,using three custom anthropomorphic breast phantoms, were utilised for itsvalidation. A user independent, inverse planning and inverse implanting techniqueis proposed.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.radonc.2018.06.003 PMID: 29934109
