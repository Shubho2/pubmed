Herein wereport the first use of VANTAs grown via chemical vapor deposition in a 2Dinterdigitated electrode (IDE) footprint with a high height-to-width aspect ratio(3:1 or 75:25 µm). The VANTA-IDEs were functionalized with an antibody (Ab)specific to the human cancerous inhibitor PP2A (CIP2A)-an oncoprotein that isassociated with a variety of malignancies such as oral, breast, and multiplemyeloma cancers. The resultant label-free immunosensor was capable of detectingCIP2A across a wide linear sensing range (1-100 pg/mL) with a detection limit of 0.24 pg/mL within saliva supernatant-a range that is more sensitive than thecorresponding CIP2A enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These results helppave the way for rapid cancer screening tests at the point-of-care (POC) such as for the early-stage diagnosis of oral cancer at a dentist's office.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
