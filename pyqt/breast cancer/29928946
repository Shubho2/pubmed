Electronic address:sfshaitelman@mdanderson.org.BACKGROUND: The impact of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) on locoregionalrecurrence (LRR) and any disease recurrence (DR) in women with node-positivebreast cancer who receive neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAT) is unknown.METHODS: The impact of RNI on LRR and DR was estimated with the cumulativeincidence method in 1289 women with stage II-III breast cancer with cytologicallyconfirmed axillary metastases who received NAT, 1989-2007. Multicovariate Coxregression analysis was performed to examine the effect of RNI after accountingfor other predictive and prognostic variables.RESULTS: The median follow-up after definitive surgery was 10.2 years. AxillarypCR was observed in 368 of 1289 patients (28.5%). On univariate analysis,axillary pCR reduced 10-year LRR risk from 9.7% to 4.8% (P=.006) and DR risk from43.0% to 17.0% (P<.001). RNI was administered to 1080 of 1289 patients (83.8%).On univariate analysis, RNI did not affect 10-year LRR risk (no RNI, 9.4%; RNI,8.1%; P=.62) or DR risk (no RNI, 31.3%; RNI, 36.5%; P=.16). On multicovariateanalysis, RNI significantly reduced the risk of LRR (hazard ratio [HR], 0.497;95% CI, 0.279-0.884; P=.02) and DR (HR, 0.731; 95% CI, 0.541-0.988; P=.04), andshowed a particularly strong reduction in risk of DR in patients with HER2+disease who received trastuzumab (HR, 0.237; 95% CI, 0.109-0.517; P=.0003). Anomogram to predict 10-year LRR risk with and without RNI has been generated toassist clinicians in individualizing treatment decisions based on patient anddisease characteristics and response to NAT.CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant RNI reduces risk of LRR and DR in breast cancer patientswith axillary metastases who receive NAT across subtypes and particularlydecreases the risk of DR in HER2+ breast cancer treated with trastuzumab.Enrollment on the NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 protocol is encouraged to help determinewhether RNI can be omitted in patients with axillary pCR to NAT.Copyright Â© 2018.
