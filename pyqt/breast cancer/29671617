Sulindac, awidely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, can prevent adenomatouscolorectal polyps and colon cancer, especially in patients with familialadenomatous polyposis. Sulindac sulfide amide (SSA) is an amide-linked sulindacsulfide analog that showed in vivo antitumor activity in a human colon tumorxenograft model. Results/methodology: A new analog series with heterocyclic ringssuch as oxazole or thiazole at the C-2 position of sulindac was prepared andscreened against prostate, colon and breast cancer cell lines to probe the effectof these novel substitutions on the activity of sulindac analogs.CONCLUSION: In general, replacement of the amide function of SSA analogs had anegative impact on the cell lines tested. A small number of hits incorporatingrigid oxazole or thiazole groups in the sulindac scaffold in place of the amidelinkage show comparable activity to our lead agent SSA.DOI: 10.4155/fmc-2017-0182 PMID: 29671617
