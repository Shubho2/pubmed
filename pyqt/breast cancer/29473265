In this study, we evaluatedvaccination-induced immune responses to clarify the survival benefit of thecombination therapy as adjuvant treatment. We enrolled 44 patients initially inan HLA-masked fashion. After the disclosure of HLA, 28 patients were in theHLA-A*2402-matched and 16 were in the unmatched group. In the HLA-matched group, 14 patients had positive CTL responses specific for the RNF43 and/or TOMM34peptides after 2 cycles of treatment and 9 had negative responses; in theHLA-unmatched group, 10 CTL responses were positive and 2 negative. In theHLA-matched group, 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly better inthe positive CTL subgroup than in the negative-response subgroup. Patients withnegative vaccination-induced CTL responses showed a significant trend towardsshorter RFS than those with positive responses. Moreover, in the HLA-unmatchedgroup, the positive CTL response subgroup showed an equally good 3-year RFS as inthe HLA-matched group. In conclusion, vaccination-induced CTL response to peptidevaccination could predict survival in the adjuvant setting for stage III CRC.Â© 2018 The Authors.
