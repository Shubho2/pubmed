We aimed to evaluate the correlation between FDGuptake on DbPET and the clinicopathological features of breast cancer,particularly those with an intratumoral heterogeneous distribution of FDG onDbPET.METHODS: We evaluated 195 consecutive patients with invasive breast cancer whounderwent preoperative whole-body PET (WBPET) and DbPET concurrently betweenJanuary 2016 and March 2017. The relationships between clinicopathologicalfactors and the maximum standard uptake values (SUVmax) of DbPET and WBPET,including clinical stage, nuclear grade, Ki67 proliferation index, estrogenreceptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) statuses, and the intratumoral heterogeneous distribution of FDG on DbPET, were evaluated.RESULTS: The SUVmax of DbPET was significantly correlated with clinical T stage, N stage, nuclear grade, and Ki67 proliferation index (all p < 0.001) as well asthe ER (p = 0.006) and HER2 (p = 0.040) statuses. Intratumoral heterogeneousdistribution of FDG on DbPET was significantly related with high nuclear grade(p = 0.016) and high Ki67 proliferation index (p = 0.015) but not with clinical Tstage, N stage, and ER and HER2 statuses.CONCLUSIONS: The SUVmax of DbPET correlates with clinicopathological factors and also WBPET does. In addition, intratumoral heterogeneity on DbPET providespredictive value for malignancy grade and could inform therapeutic decisions.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4791-1 PMID: 29779072
