Electronic address: JCashman@HBRI.org.For adult women in the United States, breast cancer is the most prevalent form ofcancer. Compounds that target dysregulated signal transduction can be efficaciousanti-cancer therapies. A prominent signaling pathway frequently dysregulated inbreast cancer cells is the Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) pathway. Thepurpose of the work was to optimize a "hit" from a screening campaign. 76,000compounds were tested in a Wnt transcription assay and revealed potent andreproducible "hit," compound 1. Medicinal chemistry optimization of 1 led to morepotent and drug-like molecules, 19, 24 and 25 (i.e., Wnt pathway IC50values = 11, 18 and 7 nM, respectively). The principal results showed compounds19, 24 and 25 were potent anti-proliferative agents in breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 (i.e., IC50 values = 10, 7 and 4 nM, respectively) and MDA-MB 231 (i.e.,IC50 values = 13, 13 and 16 nM, respectively). Compound 19 synergizedanti-proliferation with chemotherapeutic Doxorubicin in vitro. A major conclusionwas that compound 19 enhanced anti-proliferation of Doxorubicin in vitro and in axenograft animal model of breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
