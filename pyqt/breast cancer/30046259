The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy andsafety of eribulin monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with MBC.Methods: In this study, a total of 45 eligible patients with MBC who receivederibulin in HCG Cancer Speciality Center from November 2014 to March 2016 wereprospectively analyzed. Breslow (generalized Wilcoxon) survival analysis wascarried out for progression-free survival and for overall survival. Patients wereexcluded if they had not taken treatment for 3 cycles and defaulted/expiredduring the treatment.Results: In this study, median age of patients was 52 years. A total of 27 (60%) patients had estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (PR) positive primarytumors, whereas HER2 was overexpressed or amplified in 7 (15.6%); a triplenegative subtype was recorded in 13 patients (28.9%). Regarding toxicity, 30patients (66.67%) tolerated treatment well and 3 patients (6.67%) got anemia, 6patients (13.3%) experienced neutropenia, and 7 (15.62%) patients hadneurological toxicity. About 14 (31.1%) patients showed PR, 12 (26.7%) patientshad stable disease (SD), whereas 19 (42.25%) patients showed progression disease (PD). Response evaluation at 6 cycles was possible in 18 patients and revealedthat 4 (22.5%) patients showed PR, 10 (55.5%) patients had SD, whereas 4 (22.2%) patients had PD. Progression-free survival of the overall study population was3.95 months.Conclusions: Eribulin mesylate is efficacious and tolerable chemotherapy assecond- and third-line treatment options for MBC.DOI: 10.1177/1179554918782475 PMCID: PMC6055235PMID: 30046259
