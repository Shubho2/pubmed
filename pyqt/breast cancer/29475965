Investigating whether migration and acculturationpatterns in risk are reflected in disease biomarkers may help to elucidate theunderlying mechanisms.Methods: We compared the distribution of breast cancer riskfactors across U.S.-born white, African American and Hispanic women, andforeign-born Hispanic women (n = 477, ages 40-64 years, 287 born in Caribbeancountries). We used linear regression models to examine the associations ofmigration history and linguistic acculturation with mammographic breast density(MBD), measured using computer-assisted methods as percent and area of densebreast tissue.Results: The distribution of most breast cancer risk factors variedby ethnicity, nativity, and age at migration. In age- and body massindex-adjusted models, U.S.-born women did not differ in average MBD according toethnicity, but foreign-born Hispanic women had lower MBD [e.g., -4.50%; 95%confidence interval (CI), -7.12 to -1.89 lower percent density in foreign- vs.U.S.-born Hispanic women]. Lower linguistic acculturation and lower percent oflife spent in the United States were also associated with lower MBD [e.g.,monolingual Spanish and bilingual vs. monolingual English speakers, respectively,had 5.09% (95% CI, -8.33 to -1.85) and 3.34% (95% CI, -6.57 to -0.12) lowerpercent density]. Adjusting for risk factors (e.g., childhood body size, parity) attenuated some of these associations.Conclusions: Hispanic women predominantlyborn in Caribbean countries have lower MBD than U.S.-born women of diverse ethnicbackgrounds, including U.S.-born Hispanic women of Caribbean heritage.Impact: MBDmay provide insight into mechanisms driving geographic and migration variationsin breast cancer risk.
