Prof Antônio Prudente, Liberdade, Brazil.INTRODUCTION: Claudins are tight junctions associated with breast cancerprognosis. The claudin-low intrinsic subtype of invasive carcinoma is associated with high-grade carcinoma, low junction molecule expression, and worse responseto chemotherapy. However, it is not known whether the expression of claudins may provide clues as to carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) prognosis. The aim of this study was evaluate claudin-4 expression in CIS and its association with disease-freesurvival and histologic type of local recurrence (in situ or invasive).METHODS: A tissue microarray block, constructed from 137 pure CIS paraffinblocks, was submitted to immunohistochemical staining for claudin-4, β-catenin,E-cadherin, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2, and Ki-67. A claudin-4 score categorized samples asclaudin-4-low or -high. Clinical and treatment data were obtained from medicalrecords.RESULTS: Claudin-4 expression was evaluated in 86 samples; 88.4% were high and11.6% low. Mean follow-up was 98.4 months, and the local recurrence rate was10.4%. There was a significant difference in disease-free survival betweenclaudin-4-high and -low (4.9 and 1.9 years, respectively, P = .02); however,there was no difference between them in histologic type of recurrence (invasiveor in situ) (P = .44).CONCLUSION: In our samples, high claudin-4 expression in CIS was more frequentthan low expression. Claudin-4-low expression had a worse prognosis in CIS(inferior disease-free survival), but it was similar to high claudin-4 inhistologic type of local recurrence.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
