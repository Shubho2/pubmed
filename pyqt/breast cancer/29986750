Current techniques for intra-operative assessment of tumormargins are insufficient in accuracy or resolution to reliably detect smalltumors. There is a distinct need for a fast technique to accurately identifytumors smaller than 1 mm2 in large tissue surfaces within 30 min.METHODS: Multi-modal spectral histopathology (MSH), a multimodal imagingtechnique combining tissue auto-fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy was used todetect microscopic residual tumor at the surface of the excised breast tissue.New algorithms were developed to optimally utilize auto-fluorescence images toguide Raman measurements and achieve the required detection accuracy over largetissue surfaces (up to 4 × 6.5 cm2). Algorithms were trained on 91 breast tissue samples from 65 patients.RESULTS: Independent tests on 121 samples from 107 patients - including 51 fresh,whole excision specimens - detected breast carcinoma on the tissue surface with95% sensitivity and 82% specificity. One surface of each uncut excision specimen was measured in 12-24 min. The combination of high spatial-resolutionauto-fluorescence with specific diagnosis by Raman spectroscopy allows reliabledetection even for invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ smaller than1 mm2.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that this multimodal approach couldprovide an objective tool for intra-operative assessment of breast conservingsurgery margins, reducing the risk for unnecessary second operations.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1002-2 PMCID: PMC6038277PMID: 29986750
