[Epub ahead of print]Efficacy studies of Sclerotium rolfsii lectin on breast cancer using NOD SCIDmouse model.Hegde P(1), Narasimhappagari J(1), Swamy BM(1), Inamdar SR(1).Author information: (1)Department of Studies in Biochemistry, Karnatak University, Dharwad, India.Expression of altered glycans such as TF, Tn, and sTn antigens has been observed in a number of carcinomas which are targeted in cancer therapy. Sclerotiumrolfsii lectin (SRL) is known to recognize TF and its substituted forms. Clinicalpotential of SRL has been demonstrated by studying its interaction with differenttypes of cancer cells. Here we report, in vitro studies of SRL on breast cancerMDA-MB-468 cells and in vivo studies with MCF-7 xenografts. In vitro growthinhibitory studies of SRL on metastatic triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells were performed by MTT assay, flow cytometry, adhesion, and CAM assay. Invivo efficacy studies of SRL were performed using NOD SCID mice bearing MCF-7xenografts. SRL has strong binding to MDA-MB-468 cells with MFI of 85.5 and hasgrowth inhibitory effect with IC50 of 32 μg/ml at 48 hr. SRL has antiangiogenesiseffect and also anti adhesive effect with fibronectin and collagen at 20 μg/ml by36% and 42%, respectively. In vivo efficacy studies of SRL on NOD SCID micebearing MCF-7 xenogratfs revealed 61.77% and 75.71% tumor regressing effect,respectively, at 20 and 30 mg/kg body weight without any toxicity. All theseresults substantiate clinical potential of SRL on breast cancer.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.DOI: 10.1111/cbdd.13314 PMID: 29675931
