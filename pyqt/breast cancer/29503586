It has ushered in the era ofgenomic-based personalized cancer care for ER-positive primary breast cancer and is now widely utilized in various parts of the world. Together with several othergenomic assays, Oncotype DX has been incorporated into clinical practiceguidelines on biomarker use to guide treatment decisions. The Oncotype DX result is presented as the recurrence score which is a continuous score that predictsthe risk of distant disease recurrence. The assay, which provides information on clinicopathological factors, has been validated for use in the prognosticationand prediction of degree of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in both lymphnode-positive and lymph node-negative early breast cancers. Clinical studies haveconsistently shown that the Oncotype DX has a significant impact on decisionmaking in adjuvant therapy recommendations and appears to be cost-effective indiverse health care settings. In this article, we provide an overview of thevalidation and clinical impact studies for the Oncotype DX assay. We also discussits potential use in the neoadjuvant setting, as well as the more recentprospective validation trials, and the economic and utility implications ofstudies that use a lower cutoff score to define low-risk disease.DOI: 10.2147/IJWH.S124520 PMCID: PMC5827461PMID: 29503586
