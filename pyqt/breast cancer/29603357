[Epub ahead of print]Current issues with luminal subtype classification in terms of prediction ofbenefit from endocrine therapy in early breast cancer.Alfarsi L(1), Johnston S(1), Liu DX(2), Rakha E(1)(3), Green AR(1).Author information: (1)Nottingham Breast Cancer Research Centre, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells,School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham City Hospital,Nottingham, UK.(2)The Centre for Biomedical and Chemical Sciences, School of Science, Faculty ofHealth and Environmental Sciences, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland,New Zealand.(3)Cellular Pathology, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UK.Endocrine therapy for oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) isarguably the most successful targeted cancer therapy to date. Nevertheless,resistance to endocrine therapy still occurs in a significant proportion ofpatients, limiting its clinical utility. ER+ or luminal BC, which representsapproximately three-quarters of all breast malignancies, are biologicallyheterogeneous, with no distinct, clinically defined subclasses able to predictthe benefit of endocrine therapy in early settings. To improve patient outcomesthere is a clear need for improved understanding of the biology of the luminalBC, with subsequent translation into more effective methods of diagnosis toidentify potential predictive biomarkers for endocrine therapy. This reviewsummarises current knowledge of factors predictive of benefit of endocrinetherapy and discusses why molecular classification systems of BC have yet to betranslated into the clinic.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/his.13523 PMID: 29603357
