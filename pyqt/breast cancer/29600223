G. Kar Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, who had at leastundergone a core biopsy or surgery, were analyzed retrospectively fordocumentation of their ER and PR status, using the 2010 American Society ofClinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) interpretationguidelines.Results: Over a period of 3 years, a total of 927 patients were included for the study. A total of 825 (89%) patients had their ER and PR data available forevaluation. ER and PR positive was seen in 312 (37.82%) patients, ER and PRnegative in 399 (48.36%) patients, ER positive and PR negative in 71 (8.6%)patients, and ER negative and PR positive results was found in 43 (5.21%)patients.Conclusions: This is the first multi-institutional documentation of ER and PRstatus from eastern India, having a modest number of patients and one of theearliest documentations using the latest ASCO/CAP interpretation guidelines.These findings resemble the data from the south and also reiterate the fact that majority of the Indian breast cancer patients are still ER and PR negative inspite of the changes in the interpretation guidelines.DOI: 10.4103/sajc.sajc_60_17 PMCID: PMC5865099PMID: 29600223
