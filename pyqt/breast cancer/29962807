Approximately 8-ml blood samples were drawn tomeasure various biochemical parameters. Serum glucose, total cholesterol,triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were measured. Verylow-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) and LDL-C were calculated usingFriedewald's formula. Serum insulin and serum CA 15-3 were estimated by immuneenzymatic assay. IR was assessed using homeostasis model assessment IR index(HOMA-IR).Results: Clinical variables in the case and control groups were compared usingthe unpaired Student's t-test. The crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by binary logistic regressionanalysis. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to determine the associationbetween CA 15-3 and variables of interest. Total cholesterol, TG, LDL, VLDL,serum glucose, serum insulin, HOMA-IR, and serum CA 15-3 were significantlyhigher (P < 0.001) in BC patients compared to those in controls. Significantadjusted ORs with 95% CI were found to be fasting glucose, total cholesterol, andTGs. We also found a significant positive correlation between total cholesterol, TG, LDL, serum glucose, serum insulin, HOMA-IR, and serum CA 15-3.Conclusion: This study confirms the association between dyslipidemia, IR, andincreased BC risk.DOI: 10.4103/jmh.JMH_77_17 PMCID: PMC6006799PMID: 29962807
