Just overone-third of experts agreed that a combination of two chemotherapy agents insteadof one is not desirable in metastatic breast cancer because of increasedtoxicity. Most experts agreed that the main aim of a first-line therapy is tocontrol the disease over time and to preserve quality of life.CONCLUSION: Metronomically administered oral vinorelbine, either as monotherapyor in combination with other drugs, is effective in the long-term treatment ofpatients with advanced breast cancer. The clinical profiles of patients should becarefully considered to determine the appropriate treatment strategy.DOI: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1489244 PMID: 29902087
