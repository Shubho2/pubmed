However, only a minority of patients with pulmonary metastatic disease respond totreatment with checkpoint inhibitors. As an alternate approach, we have testedthe ability of systemically administered 1V270, a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)agonist conjugated to a phospholipid, to inhibit lung metastases in two variantmurine 4T1 breast cancer models, as well as in B16 melanoma, and Lewis lungcarcinoma models. In the 4T1 breast cancer models, 1V270 therapy inhibited lungmetastases if given up to a week after primary tumor initiation. The treatmentprotocol was facilitated by the minimal toxic effects exerted by the phospholipidTLR7 agonist compared with the unconjugated agonist. 1V270 exhibited a widetherapeutic window and minimal off-target receptor binding. The 1V270 therapyinhibited colonization by tumor cells in the lungs in an NK cell dependentmanner. Additional experiments revealed that single administration of 1V270 ledto tumor-specific CD8+ cell-dependent adaptive immune responses that suppressedlate-stage metastatic tumor growth in the lungs. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoireanalyses showed that 1V270 therapy induced oligoclonal T cells in the lungs andmediastinal lymph nodes. Different animals displayed commonly shared TCR clonesfollowing 1V270 therapy. Intranasal administration of 1V270 also suppressed lung metastasis and induced tumor-specific adaptive immune responses. These resultsindicate that systemic 1V270 therapy can induce tumor-specific cytotoxic T cellresponses to pulmonary metastatic cancers and that TCR repertoire analyses can beused to monitor, and to predict, the response to therapy.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1803281115 PMCID: PMC6055176 [Available on 2019-01-17]PMID: 29967183
