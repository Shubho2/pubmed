[Epub ahead of print]TGF-β induces changes in breast cancer cell deformability.Kulkarni A(1), Chatterjee A(2), Kondaiah P(3), Gundiah N(4).Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Genetics, IndianInstitute of Science, Bangalore, Karnataka, INDIA.(2)Centre for Biosystems Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Science,India, INDIA.(3)Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Genetics, IndianInstitute of Science, Bangalore, INDIA.(4)Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore560 012, Bangalore, INDIA.Mechanical properties of cells regulate cell behaviors which lead to phenotypicchanges that may aid in the development and progression of disease. In thisstudy, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation with a spherical probeto characterize the elastic and viscoelastic properties of invasive (MDA-MB-231) and noninvasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells treated with transforming growthfactor-β (TGF-β). We also used confocal fluorescence imaging to investigate thesub-membrane cytoskeletal structure of the cells. Results showed significantalterations in moduli of both cell types after 24 hour TGF-β treatment which had a context dependent response; moduli for MDA-MB-231 decreased whereas MCF-7demonstrated stiffening response. Viscoelastic characterization using stressrelaxation tests showed increased fluid-like nature of MDA-MB-231 following TGF-βtreatment and lower fluidity for MCF-7 cells. We also observed significantalterations in the expression and orientation of actin stress fibers with TGF-βtreatment which correlated with the changes in cell mechanics. The less invasive MCF-7 cells had a delayed overall increase in cell deformability after 48 hourexposure to TGF-β; a similar trend was observed for MDA-MB cells. These changesmay be important to facilitate migration, for instance, during metastasis ofcancer cells through submicron sized spaces.© 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.DOI: 10.1088/1478-3975/aac3ba PMID: 29745937
