China.Background: The construction of theranostic nanosystems with concurrently highbiosafety and therapeutic performance is a challenge but has great significancefor the clinical translation of nanomedicine for combating cancer. Methods:Bio-inspired melanin-based nanoliposomes (Lip-Mel) as theranostic agents wereconstructed for simultaneous photoacoustic (PA) imaging- and T1-weighted magneticresonance (MR) imaging-guided photothermal ablation of tumors, which wasdemonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The high biosafety of Lip-Mel was alsosystematically evaluated. Results: The achieved Lip-Mel nanoliposomesdemonstrated their imaging capability for both PA and T1-weighted MR imaging (r1 = 0.25 mM-1Â·s-1) both in vitro and in vivo, providing the potential fortherapeutic guidance and monitoring. Importantly, the desirablephotothermal-conversion efficiency of the as-prepared Lip-Mel achieved completeeradication of tumors in breast cancer-bearing mice, exhibiting remarkablephotothermal-based therapeutic performance. In particular, the efficientencapsulation of melanin into the PEGylated liposome mitigated the potentialtoxicity of melanin and improved the photothermal performance of the loadedmelanin. Systematic in vivo biosafety evaluations demonstrated the highbiocompatibility of Lip-Mel at a high dose of 100 mg/kg. Conclusion: In thiswork, we reported a bioinspired strategy where melanin, a natural product in the human body, is encapsulated into PEGylated nanoliposomes for efficienttheranostics with high biocompatibility. This work provides a new strategy forcreating desirable theranostic agents with concurrent high biocompatibility andsatisfactory theranostic performance through the use of materials that totallyoriginate from biosystems.DOI: 10.7150/thno.22430 PMCID: PMC5858169PMID: 29556343
