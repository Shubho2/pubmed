The aim of the present study wasto investigate the pro-apoptotic activities of astilbin on breast cancer in cellsand mice. It was demonstrated that astilbin significantly reduced the cellviability, increased the cell apoptosis rate, suppressed the migration ability,caused the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced theoveraccumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells after 12 or 24Â h of exposure. Data obtained from western blotting suggestedthat astilbin suppressed the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2),while it increased the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3, -8 and -9, andBcl-2-associated X protein in breast carcinoma cells. Furthermore, astilbininhibited the growth of MCF-7-xenografted tumors in nude mice without influencingtheir bodyweights or organ (liver, spleen and kidney) functions. Additionally,astilbin enhanced the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and suppressed theexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins in tumor tissues. All these resultsrevealed that astilbin exhibits pro-apoptotic properties in breast carcinomacells via modulation of the caspase-dependent pathway, which highlights thefeasibility of astilbin as a candidate agent for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6602 PMID: 30066940
