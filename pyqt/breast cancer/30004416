Additionally, they are highly toxic to normaltissues, drastically affecting the quality of life of patients. Therefore, thesearch for novel agents, which induce apoptosis in cancer cells while displaying limited toxicity towards normal cells, is paramount. The olive biophenols,oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, have displayed cytotoxicity towardscancer cells without affecting non-tumorigenic cells in cancers of the breast andprostate. However, their activity in pancreatic cancer has not been investigated.Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the anti-pancreatic cancerpotential of oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol. Pancreatic cancer cells (MIAPaCa-2, BxPC-3, and CFPAC-1) and non-tumorigenic pancreas cells (HPDE) weretreated with oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol to determine their effect on cell viability. Oleuropein displayed selective toxicity towards MIA PaCa-2 cells and hydroxytyrosol towards MIA PaCa-2 and HPDE cells. Subsequent analysis ofBcl-2 family proteins and caspase 3/7 activation determined that oleuropein andhydroxytyrosol induced apoptosis in MIA PaCa-2 cells, while oleuropein displayed a protective effect on HPDE cells. Gene expression analysis revealed putativemechanisms of action, which suggested that c-Jun and c-Fos are involved inoleuropein and hydroxytyrosol induced apoptosis of MIA PaCa-2 cells.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19071937 PMID: 30004416
