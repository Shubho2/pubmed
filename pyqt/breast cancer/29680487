[Epub ahead of print]Spectrum of Chronic Complications Related to Silicone Leakage and Migration.Ryu AJ(1), Glazebrook KN(2), Samreen N(2), Bauer PR(3), Yi ES(4), Ryu JH(5).Author information: (1)Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education, Rochester, Minn.(2)Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.(3)Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester,Minn.(4)Division of Anatomic Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.(5)Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester,Minn. Electronic address: ryu.jay@mayo.edu.BACKGROUND: Medical silicone is widely used as implants and free injections, but the spectrum of complications related to migration or embolization of siliconeremains unclear.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 79 patients with silicone migration asconfirmed on pathology between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2016. Thepresenting clinical and imaging features, diagnostic testing, treatment, andoutcome were assessed.RESULTS: Nearly all patients were women, and 43% had a history of breast cancer. Sixty-three cases (80%) consisted of localized silicone granulomas, including 1patient who developed severe hypercalcemia related to the granulomatous reaction.The remaining 16 cases (20%) involved migration of silicone to regional lymphnodes or distant tissue and included 1 case of chronic silicone pneumonitis.These complications were detected many years (median, 22 years; range, 1-40years) after initial silicone placement. Only magnetic resonance imaging,dual-energy computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography demonstratedspecificity for detection of silicone in lymph nodes and soft tissues. Othermodalities including positron emission tomography, single-energy CT, andmammography detected only nonspecific abnormalities. Excisional biopsy ofsymptomatic lymphadenopathy or masses usually led to resolution of symptoms. The patient with silicone pneumonitis improved with corticosteroid therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Chronic complications related to silicone extravasation andmigration can present with local or distant manifestations, typically encounteredmany years after the original silicone placement. Magnetic resonance imaging,dual-energy CT, and ultrasonography are helpful for noninvasive diagnosis.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
