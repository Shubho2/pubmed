Furthermore, the effect of2C19↑-2D6↓genotype-predicted phenotype is greatly enhanced in premenopausalpatients (hazard ratio: 21.08). We hypothesize that poor bioactivation oftamoxifen in patients with low CYP2D6 activity and high CYP2C19 metabolismrepresents a tamoxifen-treated patient group that has the worst clinical outcome.DOI: 10.2217/pgs-2018-0089 PMID: 30022682
