Gemelli, Roma, Italia.The influence of cell membrane fluidity on cancer progression has beenestablished in different solid tumors. We previously reported that"cancer-associated fibroblasts" (CAFs) induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and increased cell membrane fluidity and migration in poorly (MCF-7) and highlyinvasive (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells. We also found that the membranefluidity regulating enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) was upregulated intumor cells co-cultured with CAFs and established its essential role for bothintrinsic and CAF-driven tumor cell motility. Here, we further explored themechanisms involved in the SCD1-based modulation of breast cancer cell migration and investigated the role of the other human SCD isoform, SCD5. We showed thatthe addition of oleic acid, the main SCD1 product, nullified the inhibitoryeffects produced on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell migration by SCD1 depletion(pharmacological or siRNA-based). Conversely, SCD5 seemed not involved in theregulation of cancer cell motility. Interestingly, a clear induction of necrosis was observed as a result of the depletion of SCD5 in MCF-7 cells, where theexpression of SCD5 was found to be upregulated by CAFs. The necrotic effect wasrescued by a 48-h treatment of cells with oleic acid. These results providefurther insights in understanding the role of SCD1 in both intrinsic andCAF-stimulated mammary tumor cell migration, unveiling the metabolic basis ofthis desaturase-triggered effect. Moreover, our data suggest the ability of CAFs to promote the maintenance of tumor cell survival by the induction of SCD5levels.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25273 PMCID: PMC5966257PMID: 29849946
