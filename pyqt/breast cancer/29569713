[Epub ahead of print]Adiposity and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women: Results from the UKBiobank prospective cohort.Guo W(1), Key TJ(1), Reeves GK(1).Author information: (1)Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, Universityof Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.Body size is an important modifiable risk factor for postmenopausal breastcancer. However, it remains unclear whether direct measures of fat mass arebetter indicators of risk than anthropometric measures, or whether centraladiposity may contribute to risk beyond overall adiposity. We analyzed data from 162,691 postmenopausal women in UK Biobank followed from 2006 to 2014. Body size was measured by trained technicians. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression wasused to estimate relative risks. Analyses were stratified by age at recruitment, region and socioeconomic status, and adjusted for family history of breastcancer, age at menarche, age at first birth, parity, age at menopause, previoushormone replacement therapy use, smoking, alcohol intake, height, physicalactivity and ethnicity. We observed 2,913 incident invasive breast cancers duringa mean 5.7 years of follow-up. There was a continuous increase in risk ofpostmenopausal breast cancer with increasing adiposity, across all measures. The point estimate, comparing women in the top (median 37.6 kg) to bottom (median17.6 kg) quartile of body fat mass was 1.70 (95% confidence interval 1.52-1.90). The magnitudes of the associations between per SD increase in BMI and body fatmass with breast cancer risk were similar, suggesting impedance measures of fatwere not substantially better indicators of risk than anthropometric measures.After adjusting for body fat mass, the associations between anthropometricmeasures of central adiposity and breast cancer risk were attenuated. Themagnitude of risk, across all measures of adiposity, was greater in women who hadbeen postmenopausal for 12 or more years.Â© 2018 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley & SonsLtd on behalf of UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31394 PMID: 29569713
