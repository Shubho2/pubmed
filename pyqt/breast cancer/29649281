We sought to identify prognostic criteria in oligometastatic patients undergoing definitive hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT).METHODS: Exclusively extracranial oligometastatic patients treated with HIGRTwere pooled. Characteristics including age, sex, primary tumor type, interval to metastatic diagnosis, number of treated metastases and organs, metastatic site,prior systemic therapy for primary tumor treatment, prior definitivemetastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy for metastasis associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treated metastasiscontrol (TMC) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards method. Recursivepartitioning analysis (RPA) identified prognostic risk strata for OS and PFSbased on pretreatment factors.RESULTS: 361 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung (17%), colorectal (19%), and breast cancer (16%). Three-year OS was 56%, PFS was 24%, and TMC was 72%. On multivariate analysis, primary tumor, interval tometastases, treated metastases number, and mediastinal/hilar lymph node, liver,or adrenal metastases were associated with OS. Primary tumor site, involved organnumber, liver metastasis, and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with PFS. OS RPA identified five classes: class 1: all breast, kidney, orprostate cancer patients (BKP) (3-year OS 75%, 95% CI 66-85%); class 2: patients without BKP with disease-free interval of 75+ months (3-year OS 85%, 95% CI67-100%); class 3: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≤ twometastases, and age < 62 (3-year OS 55%, 95% CI 48-64%); class 4: patientswithout BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≥ three metastases, and age < 62(3-year OS 38%, 95% CI 24-60%); class 5: all others (3-year OS 13%, 95% CI5-35%). Higher biologically effective dose (BED) (p < 0.01) was associated withOS.CONCLUSIONS: We identified clinical factors defining oligometastatic patientswith favorable outcomes, who we hypothesize are most likely to benefit frommetastasis-directed therapy.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195149 PMCID: PMC5896920PMID: 29649281  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
