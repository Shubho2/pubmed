This systematic review evaluated published studies regarding time to follow-up after a positive screening for breast, cervical, colorectal,and lung cancers. The quality of available evidence was very low or low acrosscancers, with potential attenuated or reversed associations from confounding byindication in most studies. Overall, evidence suggested that the risk for poorer cancer outcomes rises with longer wait times that vary within and across cancertypes, which supports performing diagnostic testing as soon as feasible after thepositive result, but evidence for specific time targets is limited. Within these limitations, we provide our opinion on cancer-specific recommendations for times to follow-up and how existing guidelines relate to the current evidence.Thresholds set should consider patient worry, potential for loss to follow-upwith prolonged wait times, and available resources. Research is needed to better guide the timeliness of diagnostic follow-up, including considerations forpatient preferences and existing barriers, while addressing methodologicalweaknesses. Research is also needed to identify effective interventions forreducing wait times for diagnostic testing, particularly in underserved orlow-resource settings.
