We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)algorithm to better predict post-NAC axillary response using a breast MRIdataset.METHODS: An institutional review board-approved retrospective study from January 2009 to June 2016 identified 127 breast cancer patients who: (1) underwent breastMRI before the initiation of NAC; (2) successfully completedAdriamycin/Taxane-based NAC; and (3) underwent surgery, including sentinel lymph node evaluation/axillary lymph node dissection with final surgical pathologydata. Patients were classified into pathologic complete response (pCR) of theaxilla group and non-pCR group based on surgical pathology. Breast MRI performed before NAC was used. Tumor was identified on first T1 postcontrast imagesunderwent 3D segmentation. A total of 2811 volumetric slices of 127 tumors wereevaluated. CNN consisted of 10 convolutional layers, 4 max-pooling layers.Dropout, augmentation and L2 regularization were implemented to preventoverfitting of data.RESULTS: On final surgical pathology, 38.6% (49/127) of the patients achieved pCRof the axilla (group 1), and 61.4% (78/127) of the patients did not with residualmetastasis detected (group 2). For predicting axillary pCR, our CNN algorithmachieved an overall accuracy of 83% (95% confidence interval [CI] ± 5) withsensitivity of 93% (95% CI ± 6) and specificity of 77% (95% CI ± 4). Area underthe ROC curve (0.93, 95% CI ± 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to use CNN architecture to predict post NAC axillary pCR. Larger data set will likely improve our prediction model.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6613-4 PMID: 29978368
