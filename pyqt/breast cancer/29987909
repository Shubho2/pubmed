A novel imaging modality of time-stretch imaging technique for edge detection is proposed. Edge detection based on the directional derivative isrealized using differential detection. As the image processing is mainlyimplemented in the physical layer, the computation complexity of edge extraction is significantly reduced. An imaging system for edge detection with the scan rateof 77.76 MHz is experimentally demonstrated. Resolution target is first measured to verify the feasibility of the edge extraction. Furthermore, various cells,including red blood cells, lung cancer cells and breast cancer cells, aredetected. The edges of cancerous cells present in a completely different form.The imaging system for edge detection would be a good candidate forhigh-throughput cell classification.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
