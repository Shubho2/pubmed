However, the knowledge of possible factors associated with oral health incancer patients is seriously lacking in Saudi Arabia. In this study, we aimed to determine the burden of adverse oral health in cancer patients and identify theassociated factors for oral health problems.Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study design was used to recruit a totalof 375 cancer patients who attended oncology outpatient clinics at King AbdulazizMedical City - Riyadh (KAMC-R) by using a consecutive sampling technique. Aself-reporting questionnaire was used to collect the sociodemographicinformation, clinical symptoms, and lifestyle factors of cancer patients.Furthermore, depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed by using DepressionAnxiety and Stress Scale. The authors assessed the oral health complaints basedon seven common conditions (bleeding gums, toothache, mouth ulcers, bruxism,xerostomia, problems affecting speech, and satisfactory dietary intake).Unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% CIs for the factors associated with the number of oral complaints experienced were computed using Poissonregression model.Results: The prevalence of oral health conditions experienced by cancer patients was 86.1% (95% CI: 82.2%-89.5%). Female sex (aRR=1.37, 95% CI: 1.05-1.78), lowincome (aRR=1.58, 95% CI: 1.23-2.04), smoking (aRR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.02-1.64),anxiety (aRR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.36-2.24), and stress (aRR=1.25, 95% CI: 1.00-1.55)were associated with increased risk of oral health problems in cancer patients(pâ‰¤0.05), whereas breast cancer patients experienced reduced risk (aRR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.93).Conclusion: Our study highlighted the significant burden of oral health problems in Saudi cancer patients at KAMC-R and identified several key associated factors for oral health to aid healthcare practitioners in improving cancer managementpractices.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S165310 PMCID: PMC5973307PMID: 29872341
