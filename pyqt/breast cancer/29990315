It has been reported that ROCK2 is critical for cancer cell migration and invasion. The objective ofthis study was to investigate the association of ROCK2 expression withclinicopathological features and overall survival of breast cancer patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of ROCK2 in breast cancer and paired adjacentnormal tissues was detected and compared by immunohistochemical staining oftissue array. ROCK2 mRNA expression and clinicopathological information wasextracted from the TCGA breast cancer dataset. The association of ROCK2expression with the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with breastcancer was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazardsmodels. Overall survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTSImmunohistochemistry showed that ROCK2 expression was significantly higher intumor tissues than in paired adjacent normal tissues [immunoreactivity score(IRS): tumor, 5.25±2.10, n=40 vs. adjacent normal 3.83±1.06, n=40, P<0.01]. TheIRS was correlated to breast cancer staging. Similarly, the mRNA level of ROCK2was correlated to tumor stage. Notably, ROCK2 mRNA expression (hazard ratio [HR] 1.665 and 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.115-2.488, P=0.013) were also associatedwith overall survival in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Upregulation ofROCK2 was associated with the progression of breast cancer. High expression ofROCK2 may predict poor overall survival rates for breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.908507 PMCID: PMC6069530PMID: 29990315
