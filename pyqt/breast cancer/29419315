However,more recently this has shifted to an approach which recognizes that it isimportant for women to be aware of harms, such as overdiagnosis, as well asbenefits of breast screening. There is a lack of consensus in the literaturearound whether benefits clearly outweigh harms for population-based breast cancerscreening. In light of this, the gold standard for communication about breastcancer screening is now to try and support informed decision-making - that is, tohelp women understand both the advantages and disadvantages of screening,allowing them to make individual decisions about their screening participationthat reflect their informed preferences. In this review, we summarize relevantresearch to identify theoretical and practical aspects of improving communicationand decision-making about breast cancer screening, and discuss futureimplications.DOI: 10.1080/13697137.2017.1406912 PMID: 29419315
