Here we describe the concept of a chemical switch which responds toenvironmental conditions to alternate between a lipid-soluble state for efficientcargo loading and a water-soluble state for stable retention of cargos insideliposomes. A cue-responsive trigger allows release of the molecular cargo atspecific cellular sites. We demonstrate the utility of a specific glycosidicswitch for encapsulation of potent anticancer drugs and fluorescent compounds.Stable retention of drugs in liposomes allowed generation of high tumor/bloodratios of parental drug in tumors after enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosidicswitch in the lysosomes of cancer cells. Glycosidic switch liposomes could curemice bearing human breast cancer tumors without significant weight loss. Thechemical switch represents a general method to load and retain cargos insideliposomes, thereby offering new perspectives in engineering safe and effectiveliposomes for therapy and imaging.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04225-5 PMCID: PMC5945669PMID: 29748577
