The primary treatment goal was to reduce FCR severity bymodifying cognitive processes and dysfunctional behavior. Assessments of FCR and quality of life were completed by the breast cancer survivor pre-therapy,post-therapy, and at 6 and 12 months of post-therapy. In each treatment session, perceived control over FCR was assessed. A clinical nurse specialist participatedin evaluation interviews. The patient's perceived control over FCR increasedduring the therapy, and FCR severity declined to a non-clinical level. Thisimprovement was still evident at the 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments andwas supported by results for secondary and exploratory outcomes measures. FCRoffers a great challenge for health care professionals due to the lack ofeffective treatment options. This case study shows how clinical FCR can beaddressed with CBT and can contribute to the improvement of care for cancersurvivors.DOI: 10.1007/s10880-018-9545-z PMID: 29468568
