The prognosticeffect of TOP2A seems different among different subtypes of breast cancer. Thecurrent study evaluated the prognostic impact of TOP2A protein on luminal breast cancer.METHOD: Altogether 434 stage I-II luminal breast cancer patients who underwentcurative surgery in Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center between 2007 and 2009were enrolled. TOP2A protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry.Clinical and pathological data were retrospectively collected.RESULT: With a cut-off value of 30%, 127 (29.3%) patients were classified asTOP2A overexpression. TOP2A overexpression was associated with a higher tumorgrade and Ki67 index. Patients with TOP2A high expression showed a significantly higher rate of distant metastasis and shorter distant metastasis free survival(DMFS) compared with patients with low TOP2A expression. The prognostic influenceof TOP2A expression was more significant in years 5-8 after diagnosis, and morepronounced in stage II patients, luminal B disease, and patients treated withadjuvant endocrine therapy alone. Multivariate survival analysis revealed TOP2Aoverexpression was an independent fact for worse DMFS.CONCLUSION: TOP2A protein showed a time dependent influence on prognosis in stageI-II luminal breast cancer, suggesting it might be a potential predictor of late recurrence for this group of patients.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4170-7 PMCID: PMC5870251PMID: 29587760
