Electronic address:danielt@srec.ac.in.Binding interaction of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) with newly prepared rhodamine6G-capped gold nanoparticles (Rh6G-Au NPs) under physiological conditions(pH 7.2) was investigated by a wide range of photophysical techniques. Rh6G-AuNPs caused the static quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA thatresulted from the formation of ground-state complex between BSA and Rh6G-Au NPs. The binding constant from fluorescence quenching method (Ka = 1.04 × 104 L mol-1;LoD = 14.0 μM) is in accordance with apparent association constant(Kapp = 1.14 × 101 M-1), which is obtained from absorption spectral studies.Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency between the tryptophan (Trp) residue of BSA and fluorophore of Rh6G-Au NPs during the interaction wascalculated to be 90%. The free energy change (ΔG = -23.07 kJ/mol) of BSA-Rh6G-Au NPs complex was calculated based on modified Stern-Volmer Plot. The time-resolvedfluorescence analysis confirmed that quenching of BSA follows static mechanismthrough the formation of ground state complex. Furthermore, synchronous andthree-dimensional fluorescence measurement, Raman spectral analysis and Circular Dichroism spectrum results corroborate the strong binding between Rh6G-Au NPs andBSA, which causes the conformational changes on BSA molecule. In addition,fluorescence imaging experiments of BSA in living human breast cancer (HeLa)cells was successfully demonstrated, which articulated the value of Rh6G-Au NPspractical applications in biological systems.Copyright © 2018.
