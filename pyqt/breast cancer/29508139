As physical evaluation is theonly gold standard method used, our study aims to assess the incidence and early detection of AWS with a self-assessment questionnaire.METHODS: From July 2013 to July 2014, 370 breast cancer patients were enrolled.AWS incidence was 51.1%, with 94.1% onset in the first 4 weeks after surgery;43.5% of the patients did not recover in the first 8 weeks. Univariate analysisshowed that BMI (P < 0.001), age (P < 0.001), educational level (P = 0.01), andexercise frequency in the eighth week of follow-up (P < 0.001) were significantlyassociated with the AWS detection, and multivariate analyses confirmed thatyounger patients (age < 50) have significantly higher AWS detection (OR = 2.38(95%CI 1.53, 3.71) and that BMI is associated with AWS, with normal weightpatients (BMI ≤ 25) having a significantly greater AWS detection with an oddsratio of 2.11 (95%CI 1.33, 3.36).CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that the incidence of AWS is high in breastcancer patients, particularly in the first month after surgery. Not all patients achieved recovery during our 8 week follow-up, suggesting that evaluation andtreatment should be longer. Double AWS detection was found for patients who were younger (age < 50) and with normal weight.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4123-3 PMID: 29508139
