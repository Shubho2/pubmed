Based on the recent international recommendationto standardize the evaluation method, the clinical validity and utility of TILsin patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were investigated in thepresent study.PATIENTS AND METHODS: TILs were evaluated in 177 patients with BC treated withNAC and subsequent curative surgery. The correlation between TILs evaluatedaccording to the standard method and prognosis, including the efficacy of NAC,was investigated retrospectively.RESULTS: In the high-TIL group (n=96) compared to the low-TIL group (n=81),triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (p<0.001) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enriched breast cancer (HER2BC) (p=0.040) were significantly morefrequent, and the pathological complete response (pCR) rate was significantlyhigher (p=0.003). Among patients with TNBC and those with HER2BC, the pCR ratewas significantly higher in the high-TIL group than in the low-TIL group (p=0.013and p=0.014, respectively). Multivariable analysis also showed that high-TILstatus was an independent factor predicting favorable prognosis (hazardratio(HR)=0.24, p=0.023 and HR=0.13, p=0.036). Biopsy specimens from localrecurrence after successful NAC frequently showed TILs decreased.CONCLUSION: TILs may be a biomarker for predicting treatment response to NAC inpatients with TNBC and HER2BC. A decrease in TILs may also be associated withtumor recurrence.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12476 PMID: 29599354  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
