Typical associativephenotypes, such as risk factors associated with diabetes, can often be detected solely based on the data elements existing in electronic health records; however,causal phenotypes, such as risk factors causing cardiotoxicity, requireestablishing causation between chemotherapy and determining new heart disease,and cannot be directly observedfrom EHR. We propose three phenotyping algorithms to assess breast cancer patients' susceptibility to cardiotoxicity caused by fivefirst-line antineoplastic drugs: (1) causal phenotype model to predict thepatients' risk of cardiotoxicity as the difference between the heart diseaserisks with exposure and nonexposure to the drugs; (2) regular predictive model;(3) combined predictive model of the above two models. Concordances for threemethods were 0.60, 0.62, and 0.68. When considering all exposed patients,concordances were 0.66, 0.58 and 0.65 at 280 days after treatment. The studydemonstrates the potential utility of causal phenotyping.PMCID: PMC5977581PMID: 29854236
