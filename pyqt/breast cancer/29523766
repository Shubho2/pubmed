To identifyinnate signaling components of TLR5 responsible for these antitumor effects, aloss-of-function high-throughput screen was employed utilizing carcinoma cellsexpressing a dynamic NFκB bioluminescent reporter stimulated by Salmonellatyphimurium expressing flagellin. A live cell screen of a siRNA library targeting691 known and predicted human kinases to identify novel tumor cell modulators of TLR5-induced NFκB activation uncovered several interesting positive and negative candidate regulators not previously recognized, including nucleoside diphosphate kinase 3 (NME3), characterized as an enhancer of signaling responses toflagellin. Targeted knockdown and overexpression assays confirmed the regulatory contribution of NME3 to TLR5-mediated NFκB signaling, mechanistically downstream of MyD88. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that NME3 expressioncorrelated highly with TLR5 expression in breast, lung, ovarian, and gastriccancers, and furthermore, high-level expression of NME3 increased overallsurvival for patients with breast, lung, and ovarian cancer, but the opposite in gastric cancer. Together, these data identify a previously unrecognizedproinflammatory role for NME3 in signaling downstream of TLR5 that may potentiatecancer immunotherapies.Implications: Proinflammatory signaling mediated by innateimmunity engagement of flagellin-activated TLR5 in tumor cells results inantitumor effects through NME3 kinase, a positive downstream regulator offlagellin-mediated NFκB signaling, enhancing survival for several human cancers.
