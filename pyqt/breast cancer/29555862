We estimated site-specific incidence rates and survival for themost common cancers among Métis adults in Canada and compared these with ratesamong non-Aboriginal adults in Canada.METHODS: We examined responses to the 1991 long-form census, includingself-reported Métis ancestry linked to national mortality and cancer databasesfor followup from 1992 to 2009. We estimated age-standardized incidence rates and5-year relative survival. We determined relative risk (RR) of cancer among Métis and non-Aboriginal adults using Poisson regression, and estimated excessmortality rate ratios using ethnicity-specific life tables.RESULTS: For all cancers and both sexes combined, cancer incidence was similarfor Métis and non-Aboriginal adults. However, incidence was significantly higher among Métis adults than among non-Aboriginal adults for the following cancers:female breast (RR 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.37), lung (RR 1.34,95% CI 1.18-1.52), liver (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.30-3.38), larynx (RR 1.60, 95% CI1.03-2.48), gallbladder (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.12-4.96) and cervix (RR 1.84, 95% CI1.23-2.76). Métis people had poorer survival for prostate cancer (excessmortality rate ratio 2.60, 95% CI 1.52-4.46).INTERPRETATION: We found higher incidence for several cancers and poorer survivalafter prostate cancer among Métis adults. Several of these disparities may berelated to lifestyle factors (including tobacco use, obesity and lack of cancerscreening), providing evidence to support development of public health policy andhealth care to address cancer burden in the Métis people of Canada.© 2018 Joule Inc. or its licensors.DOI: 10.1503/cmaj.170272 PMCID: PMC5860893PMID: 29555862
