This study investigated patterns of use of docetaxel(T) in real-life clinical practice in China.Methods: This was a retrospective pooled analysis of the Asia-Pacific BreastInitiatives (APBI) I (2006-2008) and II (2009-2011) registries, and two Chineseobservational studies; BC STATE (2011-2014) and BC Local Registry (2007-2010).Female Chinese adults (â‰¥18 years) with operable breast cancer treated withdocetaxel-based adjuvant chemotherapy were included in the analysis. Patientswith metastatic disease were excluded. The primary endpoint was assessment oftreatment patterns and patient profiles. A logistic regression analysis wasconducted to identify factors associated with choice of adjuvant chemotherapyregimen.Results: Data from 3,020 patients were included. The most frequently usedadjuvant regimen was docetaxel/anthracycline combination [n=1,421 (47.1%); ofwhom 52.0% received T/epirubicin (E)/cyclophosphamide (C)], followed bydocetaxel/other [n=705 (23.3%); of whom 72.8% received TC],docetaxel/anthracycline sequential [n=447 (14.8%); of whom 40.9% and 39.6%received 5-Fu/EC-T and EC-T, respectively], and " other" [n=447 (14.8%); of whom 91.5% received T]. A significant association was found between adjuvant therapywith docetaxel/anthracycline combination and patient weight, menopausal statusand estrogen receptor status.Conclusions: Real-world data revealed that docetaxel/anthracycline combination isthe most commonly used category of docetaxel-based adjuvant therapy for patients with operable breast cancer in China; of which TEC is the most frequently usedregimen.DOI: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.03.05 PMCID: PMC6037591PMID: 30046227
