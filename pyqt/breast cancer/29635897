Electronic address:zhang.zhenya.fu@u.tsukuba.ac.jp.To evaluate the in vivo immunomodulatory activity of the crude polysaccharidefrom Helicteres angustifolia L. (HACP), a 4T1 breast tumor model in BALB/c micewas used in this study. After tumor incubation for 6 days, mice were orallyadministered with 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg of HACP for 15 days. The results showthat HACP administration resulted in a remarkable immunomodulatory effectattributable to the increased spleen and thymus indices, unregulated CD4+/CD8+ratios in spleen lymphocytes, and the augmentation of IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-αproductions in the serum of tumor-bearing mice. The increased immunity resultedin a significant reduction in the tumor weight in 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg of HACPtreatment groups, achieving inhibition rates of 34.58 ± 10.20%, 57.80 ± 8.65% and67.71 ± 5.80%, respectively. In addition, a reduced lung metastasis was alsodetected in the HACP treatment groups. These findings, for the first time,provide scientific evidence that HACP can improve the immune response in 4T1tumor-bearing mice, which plays a major role in the antitumor effect. Thus, HACP is prospectively valuable to be developed as new products with immunomodulatoryactivity and used for the treatment of breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
