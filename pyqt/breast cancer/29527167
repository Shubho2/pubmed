Herein, we reported a synergisticchemo-photothermal strategy based on aptamer (Apt)-polydopamine (pD)functionalized CA-(PCL-ran-PLA) nanoparticles (NPs) for effective delivery ofdocetaxel (DTX) and enhanced therapeutic effect. The developed DTX-loadedApt-pD-CA-(PCL-ran-PLA) NPs achieved promising advantages, such as (i) improveddrug loading content (LC) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) initiated bystar-shaped copolymer CA-(PCL-ran-PLA); (ii) effective target delivery of drugsto tumor sites by incorporating AS1411 aptamers; (iii) significant therapeuticefficacy caused by synergistic chemo-photothermal treatment. In addition, the pD coating strategy with simple procedures could address the contradiction betweentargeting modification and maintaining formerly excellent bio-properties.Therefore, with excellent bio-properties and simple preparation procedures, theDTX-loaded Apt-pD-CA-(PCL-ran-PLA) NPs effectively increased the local drugconcentration in tumor sites, minimized side effects, and significantlyeliminated tumors, indicating the promising application of these NPs for cancertherapy.DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00125 PMCID: PMC5829531PMID: 29527167
