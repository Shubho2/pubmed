[Epubahead of print]Women's experiences of cancer-related cognitive impairment, its impact on dailylife and care received for it following treatment for breast cancer.Bolton G(1), Isaacs A(1).Author information: (1)a Monash University School of Rural Health [Latrobe Valley and West Gippsland], Traralgon , VIC , Australia.Several women who undergo treatment for breast cancer experience cancer-relatedcognitive impairment [CRCI] commonly known as 'Chemobrain' or 'Chemofog'.However, many oncologists and other cancer clinicians are unaware of the highprevalence and severity of these symptoms. Few qualitative studies on the topicprovide a comprehensive description of this phenomenon. This study provides adetailed description of women's experiences of CRCI, its impact on daily life andcare received for it following treatment for breast cancer in Australia.Experiences of CRCI included difficulty in remembering things and recallingpreviously known tasks, inability to stay focussed on a task and other symptoms. The impact on daily life included economic, psychosocial and minimal impacts.Participants described both good care received as well as the clinical team'slack of understanding of CRCI. We conclude that CRCI in women treated for breast cancer affects memory and attention and has a significant impact on women'slives. Care provided for CRCI is inadequate in Australia. The economic andpsychosocial impacts on women's daily lives coupled with increasing rates ofsurvivorship highlight the need for more resources to be allocated for themanagement of these symptoms.DOI: 10.1080/13548506.2018.1500023 PMID: 30048158
