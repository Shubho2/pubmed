CXCR4 antagonists have been shown to enhance theactivity of different anticancer treatments in preclinical models. We assessedthe safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary phase 1 activity ofthe CXCR4 antagonist, balixafortide, in combination with eribulin chemotherapy inpatients with heavily pretreated, relapsed metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: This single-arm, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial enrolled patients at 11 sites in Spain and the USA. Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or olderwho had histologically confirmed HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, evidenceof tumour cell CXCR4 expression, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Groupperformance status of 0 or 1, and who had previously received between one andthree chemotherapy regimens for metastatic breast cancer, and at least oneendocrine therapy if they had hormone receptor-positive disease, unless they wereconsidered unsuitable for endocrine therapy. A standard 3+3 dose-escalationdesign was used, followed by an expanded cohort at the established maximumtolerated dose or highest dose if no dose-limiting toxicity was observed for the combination. After a treatment-related fatal adverse event in the first cohortwho received 21-day cycles of treatment with eribulin and balixafortide, aprotocol amendment modified the study design to be done in two parts. Patientsenrolled to part 1 received an initial 28-day run-in cycle, with some cohortsreceiving de-escalated doses of eribulin plus balixafortide to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of the combination. The evaluation of part 1 did not confirmany dose-limiting toxicities or eribulin-balixafortide interactions, andtherefore part 2 started enrolling patients to receive eribulin at the originallyplanned dose of 1·4 mg/m2 on days 2 and 9 of a 21-day cycle and balixafortidefrom a starting dose of 2 mg/kg with dose increments of 0·5 or 1 mg/kg on days1-3 and 8-10 of the 21-day cycle. Both drugs were administered as intravenousinfusions. All patients were to receive treatment until disease progression orunacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities andadverse events, and the establishment of a maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose, and pharmacokinetic parameters. Safety analysis was done in allpatients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Analysis ofantitumour activity was done in all patients who received at least one full cycleof study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, numberNCT01837095, and is closed to accrual.FINDINGS: Between Jan 28, 2014, and Oct 4, 2016, 56 patients were enrolled intothe trial. No dose-limiting toxicities were confirmed and the maximum tolerateddose was not reached. The highest dose was established as eribulin 1·4 mg/m2 ondays 2 and 9, and balixafortide 5·5 mg/kg on days 1-3 and 8-10 of the 21-daycycle. Objective responses (all partial responses) were observed in 16 (30%; 95% CI 18-44) of 54 patients who were evaluable for antitumour activity. The mostcommon treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade were fatigue (44 [79%] of56 patients), neutropenia (32 [57%]), infusion-related reactions (27 [48%]),alopecia (26 [46%]), constipation (26 [46%]), and nausea (25 [45%]). Seriousadverse events occurred in 21 (38%) of 56 patients, including febrile neutropeniain five (9%) of 56 patients, neutrophil count decrease in two (4%) patients,constipation in two (4%) patients, pneumonia in two (4%) patients, and urinarytract infection in three (5%) patients. Two (4%) of 56 patients died whilereceiving study treatment; one from septic shock and one from pneumonia.INTERPRETATION: The safety and tolerability of balixafortide plus eribulin seems to be similar to that of eribulin or balixafortide monotherapy, and thepreliminary activity of the combination seems promising in patients withHER-negative metastatic breast cancer. The results suggest that balixafortideplus eribulin has potential to provide a new therapeutic option in heavilypretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer and warrants furtherinvestigation in randomised trials.FUNDING: Polyphor.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
