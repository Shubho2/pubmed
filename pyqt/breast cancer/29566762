Stereotactic APBI has been attempted, although there islittle experience using CyberKnife (CK) for early breast cancer.METHODS: This pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of CK-APBI on 20evaluable patients of 29 eligible, followed for 2 years. The primary endpoint wasacute/sub-acute toxicity; secondary endpoints were late toxicity and the cosmeticresult.RESULTS: Mean pathological tumor size was 10.5 mm (±4.3, range 3-18), 8 of these patients were classified as LumA-like, 11 as LumB-like, and 1 asLumB-HER2-enriched. Using CK-APBI with Iris, the treatment time was approximately60 min (range~ 35 to ~ 120). All patients received 30 Gy in five fractionsdelivered to the PTV. The median number of beams was 180 (IQR 107-213;range:56-325) with a median PTV isodose prescription of 86.0% (IQR 85.0-88.5;range:82-94). The median PTV was 88.1 cm3 (IQR 63.8-108.6; range:32.3-238.8). Themedian breast V100 and V50 was 0.6 (IQR 0.1-1.5; range:0-13) and 18.6 (IQR13.1-21.7; range:7.5-37), respectively. The median PTV minimum dose was 26.2 Gy(IQR 24.7-27.6; range 22.3-29.3). Mild side effects were recorded during theperiod of observation. Cosmetic evaluations were performed by three observersfrom the start of radiotherapy up to 2 years. Patients' evaluation progressively increase from 60% to 85% of excellent rating; this trend was similar to that ofexternal observer.CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results showed the safe feasibility of CK-APBI in early breast cancer, with mild acute and late toxicity and very good cosmeticresults.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present study is registered at Clinicaltrial.gov (NCT02896322 ).
