A major challengefor such integrated study is that the association between DNA methylation andgene expression is severely confounded by tumor purity and cell type composition,which are often unobserved and difficult to estimate. To overcome this challenge,we developed a method to remove confounding effects by calculating the principal components that span the space of the latent factors. Another intriguing findingsof our study is that there could be both positive and negative associationsbetween SCNA and DNA methylation, while the CpGs with negative/positiveassociations with SCNA are often located around CpG islands/ocean, respectively. A joint study of SCNA, DNA methylation, and gene expression suggest that SCNAoften affect DNA methylation and gene expression independently.DOI: 10.1093/nar/gky131 PMCID: PMC5887505PMID: 29529299
