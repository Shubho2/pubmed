We present the first case of advanced SDC of the minor salivary gland arising from the supraglottis and review the literature onthe clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of SDC.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 59-year-old male patient with progressive difficulty inswallowing and a muffled voice for 2 months.DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with SDC arising from the supraglottis with extensive tumor invasion into the subsites of the larynx and pharynx.INTERVENTIONS: Due to impending airway obstruction, the patient underwent CO2laser debulking surgery. In addition to local disease, lymph node and distantmetastases were also noted at diagnosis and concurrent chemoradiation therapy wasarranged.OUTCOMES: Laryngeal function was preserved and tracheostomy was avoided. Thepatient has survived for >1 year after the initial diagnosis.LESSONS: SDC is a rare and aggressive subtype of salivary gland carcinoma thathistologically resembles in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.Here we presented the first case of advanced SDC of the minor salivary glandarising from the supraglottis that was treated with CO2 laser debulking surgeryfollowed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Due to their rarity, furtherstudies are required to establish the most effective treatment protocol foradvanced SDC.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010095 PMCID: PMC5882407PMID: 29538201  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
