In this study, we prepared multifunctional microspheres loading 131I-labeled hollow copper sulfide nanoparticles andpaclitaxel (131I-HCuSNPs-MS-PTX) for imaging and therapeutics of W256/B breasttumors in rats. 18F-fluordeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emissiontomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging detected that the expansion ofthe tumor volume was delayed (P<0.05) following intra-tumoral (i.t.) injectionwith 131I-HCuSNPs-MS-PTX plus near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. Theimmunohistochemical analysis further confirmed the anti-tumor effect. The single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/photoacoustic imaging mediated by131I-HCuSNPs-MS-PTX demonstrated that microspheres were mainly distributed in thetumors with a relatively low distribution in other organs. Our results revealedthat 131I-HCuSNPs-MS-PTX offered combined photothermal, chemo- andradio-therapies, eliminating tumors at a relatively low dose, as well as allowingSPECT/CT and photoacoustic imaging monitoring of distribution of the injectedagents non-invasively. The copper sulfide-loaded microspheres,131I-HCuSNPs-MS-PTX, can serve as a versatile theranostic agent in an orthotopic breast cancer model.DOI: 10.1016/j.apsb.2018.04.001 PMCID: PMC5990345PMID: 29881676
