Althoughmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is accurate in predicting residual cancer, ifcalcification remains, the issue of whether to perform the surgery on the basisof the residual tumor prediction range in mammography (MMG) or MRI has not yetbeen elucidated. This study aimed to estimate the accuracy of predicting residualtumor after NST for residual microcalcification on mammographic and enhancinglesion on MRI.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective study. We included breast cancer patients who underwent NST, had microcalcifications in the post-NSTMMG, and underwent surgery from January 2, 2013 to December 30, 2014 at AsanMedical Center. Patients with post-NST MMG as well as MRI were included. Finalpathologic tumor size with histopathology and biomarker status were obtainedpostoperatively.RESULTS: In total, 151 patients were included in this study. Overall, MRIcorrelated better than MMG in predicting the tumor size (intraclass correlationcoefficient [ICC], 0.769 vs. 0.651). For hormone receptor (HR)-positive(HR+)/HER2- subtype, MMG had higher correlation than MRI (ICC = 0.747 vs. 0.575).In HR- subtype, MRI had a strong correlation with pathology (HR-/HER2+ or triple negative (TN), ICC = 0.939 vs. 0.750), whereas MMG tended to overestimate thetumor size (HR-/HER2+ or TN, ICC = 0.543 vs. 0.479).CONCLUSION: Post-NST residual microcalcifications on MMG have a lower correlationwith residual tumor size than MRI. Other than HR+/HER2- subtype, the extent ofcalcifications on preoperative evaluation might not be accurate in evaluating theresidual extent of the tumor after NST.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
