Intrinsic properties of breasttumors, including altered gene expression profile and dynamic evaluation ofmetabolic properties of tumor cells using positron emission tomography/computedtomography (PET/CT) of tumor cells, have been identified to guide patient'sprognosis. The aim of this study is to determine if both analyses may improve theprediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER-positive / HER2-negativebreast cancers (BCs) patients.Methods: We used metabolic PET parameters, at diagnosis and after two cycles ofchemotherapy and proliferation gene expression profile on biopsy at diagnosis, inparticular, the genomic grade index (GGI) analyzed by reverse transcription andquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The pathological response wasthe surrogate endpoint.Results: The change of FDG uptake between baseline PET and interim PET after 2cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ΔSUVmax) was highly associated with pCR(p=0.008). We also observed an ability of P53 mutated status (p=0.042), inaddition to histological grade (p=0. 0004), and PR expression (p=0.01) to predictpCR in ER-positive BCs, whereas no proliferation marker predicted pCR (P=0.39 forGGI). Finally, only ΔSUVmax was significantly associated with event free survival(p=0.047).Conclusions: Our results confirm the predictive and prognostic value of tumorΔSUVmax in ER-positive /HER2-negative advanced BCs patients. These findings canbe helpful to select high-risk patients within trials investigating noveltreatment strategies.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24674 PMCID: PMC5893244PMID: 29662649
