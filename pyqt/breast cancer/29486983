A neoadjuvant regimen with chemotherapy and an antiangiogenic strategywas investigated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with primary or recurrent IBC who were candidates for neoadjuvant treatment received weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel plusbevacizumab every 3 weeks and oral metronomic cyclophosphamide for 6 months.Trastuzumab was added for patients with HER2+ tumors and endocrine therapy wasadded for patients with estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor ≥ 10%tumors. Oral metronomic capecitabine and cyclophosphamide was continued for 6months after surgery in those patients with a response. The primary efficacyendpoints were pathologic complete remission (pCR) and the objective response.RESULTS: From July 2010 to December 2013, 34 patients with IBC were included. Thesurrogate intrinsic tumor subtypes were as follows: luminal B-like (HER2-), 10(29%); luminal B-like (HER2+), 8 (24%); HER2+ (nonluminal), 6 (18%); and triplenegative, 10 (29%). An objective response was obtained in 30 patients (88%; 95%confidence interval, 73%-97%) and a pCR in 10 patients (29%; 95% confidenceinterval, 15%-48%). The proportion of pCR was significantly greater in thepatients with HER2+ tumors (57%) than in patients with triple-negative (20%) orluminal B-like (HER2-) tumors (0%; P = .019). After a median follow-up of 4.4years, the 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival was 58% and 72%,respectively. The achievement of pCR was associated with longer disease-free (P =.12) and overall (P = .029) survival.CONCLUSION: In patients with IBC, neoadjuvant treatment with the investigatedregimen was successful and well tolerated. Further studies evaluating thepotential benefit of an antiangiogenic strategy in this setting are awaited.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
