However, the underlying mechanism isstill ambiguous. In this study, we investigate the physiopathologic role oflncRNA ferritin heavy chain 1 pseudogene 3 (FTH1P3) on the paclitaxel (PTX)resistance in breast cancer. Results showed that lncRNA FTH1P3 was up-regulatedin paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer tissue and cells (MCF-7/PTX andMDA-MB-231/PTX cells) compared with paclitaxel-sensitive tissue and parental celllines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231). Gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed thatFTH1P3 silencing decreased the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value ofpaclitaxel and induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, while FTH1P3-enhancedexpression exerted the opposite effects. In vivo, xenograft mice assay showedthat FTH1P3 silencing suppressed the tumour growth of paclitaxel-resistant breastcancer cells and ABCB1 protein expression. Bioinformatics tools and luciferasereporter assay validated that FTH1P3 promoted ABCB1 protein expression throughtargeting miR-206, acting as a miRNA "sponge." In summary, our results reveal thepotential regulatory mechanism of FTH1P3 on breast cancer paclitaxel resistancethrough miR-206/ABCB1, providing a novel insight for the breast cancerchemoresistance.Â© 2018 The Authors.
