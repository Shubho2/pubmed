However, the regulatory mechanism(s) behind this processand its association with breast cancer remain to be elucidated. Here we reportthat Flightless-I (FliI), a novel p62-interacting protein, promotes breast cancerprogression by impeding selective autophagy. FliI was highly expressed inclinical breast cancer samples, and heterozygous deletion of FliI retardeddevelopment of mammary tumors in PyVT mice. FliI induced p62-recruited cargoesinto Triton X-100 insoluble fractions (TI) to form aggregates, thereby blockingp62 recognition of LC3 and hindering p62-dependent selective autophagy. Thisfunction of Flil was reinforced by Akt-mediated phosphorylation at Ser436 andinhibited by phosphorylation of Ulk1 at Ser64. Obstruction of autophagicclearance of p62-recruited cargoes by FliI was associated with the accumulationof oxidative damage on proteins and DNA, which could contribute to thedevelopment of cancer. Heterozygous knockout of FliI facilitated selectivelyautophagic clearance of aggregates, abatement of ROS levels, and proteinoxidative damage, ultimately retarding mammary cancer progression. In clinicalbreast cancer samples, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FliI at Ser436 negatively correlated with long-term prognosis, while Ulk1-induced FliI phosphorylation atSer64 positively correlation with clinical outcome. Together, this workdemonstrates that FliI functions as a checkpoint protein for selective autophagy in the crosstalk between FliI and p62-recruited cargoes, and its phosphorylation may serve as a prognostic marker for breast cancer.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-3835 PMID: 29898994
