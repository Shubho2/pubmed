However, emergence of treatment resistance and trastuzumabassociated cardiotoxicity remain clinical challenges. In an effort to improvepatient outcome, we have developed and evaluated novel tri-functionalimmunoliposomes (TFIL) that target HER2-receptors on BC cells and CD3-receptorson T-lymphocytes, and deliver DOX.METHODS: Trastuzumab (anti-HER2) and OKT-3 (anti-CD3) antibodies were conjugated to liposomes using a micelle-transfer method. Cytotoxicity of targetedimmunoliposomes loaded with DOX was examined in vitro on HER2-positive BC cells(BT474), with peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMC) as immune effector cells.RESULTS: TFIL demonstrated high antibody-liposome conjugation ratios (100-130 μg protein/μmol phospholipid) and cargo capacity (0.21 mol:mol drug:lipid), highlyefficient DOX loading (>90%), a particle size favorable for extended circulation (~150 nm), and good stability (up to 3 months at 4°C). In the presence of PBMCs, TFIL showed complete killing of BT474 cells, and were superior to mono-targetedtrastuzumab-bearing liposomes, non-targeted liposomes, and free Trastuzumab andDOX.CONCLUSIONS: Novel anti-HER2xCD3 + DOX TFIL show promise as a means to bothengage immune cells against HER2 positive breast cancer cells and deliverchemotherapy, and have the potential to improve clinical outcomes.DOI: 10.1007/s11095-018-2365-x PMID: 29536232
