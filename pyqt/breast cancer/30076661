The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is helpful for theassessment of tumor size and surgical planning in early BC.METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collecteddatabase of 174 patients treated at a single institution for invasive BC who had complete documentation of the tumor size from mammography (MMG), ultrasonography (US), and MRI.RESULTS: A total of 186 breast tumors were analyzed. Mean tumor size varied byimaging method: 14.7 mm by MMG, 13.8 mm by US, and 17.9 mm by MRI. Theconcordance between breast imaging techniques (BIT) and final pathology with acutoff ≤ 2 mm was 34.8% for MRI, 32.1% for US, and 27.2% for MMG. US and MMGunderestimated while MRI and MMG overestimated the real tumor size. Concordancewas the same in premenopausal women for MRI and US at 35%, while concordance was higher in postmenopausal women for MRI. Correlations between size determined byBIT and histopathological size were best with MRI (0.59), compared to US (0.56)or MMG (0.42). Intrinsic subtypes of BC had different concordances according toimaging method, but no significant associations were found. MRI examinationrevealed additional lesions in 13.8% of patients, 69% of these lesions weremalignant. MRI changed the surgical plan in 15 patients (8.6%), and the rate ofmastectomy increased by 6.9%.CONCLUSIONS: MRI estimates BC tumor size more accurately than US or MMG, but asignificant overestimation exists. Complementary MRI examination improved theconcordance for tumor size between BIT and final pathology in 16.7%. MRI did not alter surgical planning for most patients and allowed more appropriate treatment for 8% of them.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13104 PMID: 30076661
