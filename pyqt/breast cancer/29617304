Falko.Fend@med.uni-tuebingen.de.Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) represents a group of malignant T-celllymphoproliferations that share morphological and immunophenotypical features,namely strong CD30 expression and variable loss of T-cell markers, but differ in clinical presentation and prognosis. The recognition of anaplastic lymphomakinase (ALK) fusion proteins as a result of chromosomal translocations orinversions was the starting point for the distinction of different subgroups ofALCL. According to their distinct clinical settings and molecular findings, the2016 revised World Health Organization (WHO) classification recognizes fourdifferent entities: systemic ALK-positive ALCL (ALK+ ALCL), systemic ALK-negativeALCL (ALK&minus; ALCL), primary cutaneous ALCL (pC-ALCL), and breastimplant-associated ALCL (BI-ALCL), the latter included as a provisional entity.ALK is rearranged in approximately 80% of systemic ALCL cases with one of itspartner genes, most commonly NPM1, and is associated with favorable prognosis,whereas systemic ALK&minus; ALCL shows heterogeneous clinical, phenotypical, and genetic features, underlining the different oncogenesis between these twoentities. Recognition of the pathological spectrum of ALCL is crucial tounderstand its pathogenesis and its boundaries with other entities. In thisreview, we will focus on the morphological, immunophenotypical, and molecularfeatures of systemic ALK+ and ALK&minus; ALCL. In addition, BI-ALCL will bediscussed.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10040107 PMCID: PMC5923362PMID: 29617304
