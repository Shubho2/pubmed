NC-LCIS is the least well-characterized lesion, withscant published literature on its natural history and surgical management whenencountered on needle biopsy. Recent data suggest that lobular neoplasia on core biopsy of a BI-RADS ≤ 4 concordant lesion does not require an excision, whileADH, atypical papillomas, and NC-LCIS should be excised. Evidence on FEA andpapillomas without atypia suggests a low risk of upgrade on excision, andprospective studies on the upgrade of these lesions are ongoing.DOI: 10.1007/s11912-018-0682-1 PMID: 29572753
