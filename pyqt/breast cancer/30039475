Herein, the mRNA-cleaving DNAzyme that targets the mRNA of MDR1 gene indoxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cell line (MCF-7/DR) loaded on the chitosanβ-cyclodextrin complexes was used as a tropical agent. Chitosan/β-cyclodextrincomplexes were used to deliver DNAzymes into cancer cells. Determination of thephysicochemical characteristics of the particles was done by photon correlationspectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The encapsulation efficiency ofthe complexes was tested by using gel retardation assay. Positively chargednanoparticles interacted with DNAzyme that could perform as an efficient DNAzyme transfection system. The rationale usage of this platform is to sensitizeMCF-7/DR to doxorubicin by downregulating the drug-resistance gene MDR1. Results demonstrated a downregulation of MDR1 mRNAs in MCF-7/DR/DNZ by real-time PCR,compared to the MCF-7/DR as control. WST1 assay showed the 22-fold decrease indrug resistance on treated cells 24 h after transfection. Results showed theintracellular accumulation of Rh123 increased in the treated cells with DNAzyme. Results suggested a potential platform in association with chemotherapy drug for cancer therapy and indicated extremely efficient at delivery of DNAzyme inrestoring chemosensitivity.DOI: 10.1007/s12010-018-2836-x PMID: 30039475
