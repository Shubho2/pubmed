PAX2, a member of the Paired box family of transcriptional regulators, is normally expressed duringembryonic development, including in the kidney, where it promotes mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). PAX2 expression is silenced in many normal adulttissues. However, in contrast, PAX2 is expressed in several cancer types,including kidney, prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer. While multiple studieshave implicated TGF-β superfamily members in modulating expression of Pax genesduring embryonic development, few have investigated direct regulation of Pax geneexpression by TGF-β1. Here we have investigated direct regulation of PAX2expression by TGF-β1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CC-RCC) cell lines.Treatment of PAX2-expressing 786-O and A498 CC-RCC cell lines with TGF-β1resulted in inhibition of endogenous PAX2 mRNA and protein expression, as well asexpression from transiently transfected PAX2 promoter constructs; this inhibitionwas abolished in the presence of expression of the inhibitory SMAD, SMAD7. Using ChIP-PCR we showed TGF-β1 treatment induced SMAD3 protein phosphorylation in786-O cells, and direct SMAD3 binding to the human PAX2 promoter, which wasinhibited by SMAD7 over-expression. Overall, these data suggest that canonicalTGF-β signalling suppresses PAX2 transcription in CC-RCC cells due to the direct binding of SMAD proteins to the PAX2 promoter. These studies improve ourunderstanding of tumor progression and epithelial to mesenchyme transition (EMT) in CC-RCC and in other PAX2-expressing cancer types.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25516 PMCID: PMC6003550PMID: 29928489
