Mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting proteinkinases (MNK1/2) phosphorylate eIF4E on Ser209, promoting the expression ofoncogenic proteins, whereas mTORC1 phosphorylates and de-activates the eIF4Einhibitor, 4E-BP1, to release translational repression. Here we show thatinhibiting these pathways simultaneously effectively slows the rate of cellmigration in breast cancer cells. However, a molecular hybridisation approachusing novel, cleavable dual MNK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR inhibiting hybrid agents wasless effective at slowing cell migration.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24354 PMCID: PMC5865660PMID: 29581834
