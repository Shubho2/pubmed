Data for 92 breast cancer patients from thecommercial Caris Molecular Intelligence database was retrospectively divided intotwo groups, so that the first always followed treatment recommendations, whereas in the second group all patients received at least one drug after profiling that was predicted to lack benefit. The biomarker and drug associations were based on tests including fluorescent in situ hybridization and DNA sequencing, althoughimmunohistochemistry was the main test used. Patients whose drugs matched thoserecommended according to their tumor profile had an average overall survival of667 days, compared to 510 days for patients that did not (P=0.0316). In thematched treatment group, 26% of patients were deceased by the last time ofmonitoring, whereas this was 41% in the unmatched group (P=0.1257). We therefore confirm the ability of tumor molecular profiling to improve survival of breastcancer patients. Immunohistochemistry biomarkers for the androgen, estrogen andprogesterone receptors were found to be prognostic for survival.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24564 PMCID: PMC5915140PMID: 29707132
