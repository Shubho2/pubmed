All the transition probabilities and utility weights were derivedfrom clinical trials and/or published literatures. The costs populated in thechemotherapy model were extracted from Medicare, Pharmaceutical Benefit Schemeand the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. No cost was considered in thepost-chemotherapy model. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test therobustness of the results.RESULTS: From the first chemotherapy model, lipegfilgrastim was associated withfewer episodes of severe neutropenia (SN) (N = 142 per 1000 patients treated),febrile neutropenia (FN) (N = 29 per 1000 patients treated), infection (N = 17per 1000 patients treated) and chemotherapy delayed (N = 170 per 1000 patientstreated) and lower cost ($116.88 less per patient treated). The post-chemotherapymodel indicated lipegfilgrastim led to higher gains in both life years (18.72versus 18.61) and quality-adjusted life years (17.28 versus 17.18) in comparison to pegfilgrastim. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results from thechemotherapy model is very sensitive to the baseline risk of SN; while from theprobabilistic sensitivity analysis, lipegfilgrastim was likely to be morecost-effective than pegfilgrastim based on two models.CONCLUSIONS: Lipegfilgrastim was likely to be a cost-effective alternative topegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis. The sensitivity analysis showed theconfidence interval for the cost and benefit outcomes overlapped to a greatextent, suggesting an insignificant difference.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0872-6 PMID: 29802592
