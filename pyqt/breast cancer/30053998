However, it may cause left ventriculardysfunction, resulting in withdrawal of therapy. Left atrium (LA) enlargement hasproven to cue subclinical ventricular dysfunction in various clinical setting.Aim of the study was to investigate the association between LA volume index(LAVI) change over time and the development of Cancer Therapeutics RelatedCardiac Dysfunction (CTRCD). Consecutive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2positive BC patients were retrospectively included. Transthoracicechocardiography was performed before starting Trastuzumab and at every 3 up to12 months. LA volume was measured using the modified Simpson's rule and indexedfor body surface area. Ninety patients formed the study population. All patients had a complete 12 months follow-up. Mean baseline LAVI was 27 ± 8 ml/m2 and itwas dilated (≥34 ml/m2) in 10 patients (11%). During follow-up, CTRCD occurred in19 (21%) patients and there was modest LAVI enlargement, with a mean increase of 3 ± 2 ml/m2 (p = 0.0002 vs. baseline). LAVI dilation was significantly higher in patients with CTRCD (average increase at the time of CTRCD vs. baseline: 7 ± 6ml/m2, p = 0.008), versus patients without CTRCD (average increase at 12 monthsof follow-up 2±1, p = 0.02), p for comparison = 0.004. LAVI dilatation over time predicted CTRCD independently from baseline LAVI values and the presence ofsystemic arterial hypertension (OR for 5 ml/m2 dilation was 1.56 [95%CI 1.09 to2.37], p = 0.01). Trastuzumab related CTRCD is associated with significant LAVImorphological remodeling in BC patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
