The system is based on microfabricated sensor chips embedded instandard cell culture flasks. Ideally, the sensor chips could be equipped withany electrochemical sensor. Its transparency allows optical inspection of thecells during measurement. The surface of the sensor chip is in-plane with theflask surface allowing undisturbed cell growth on the sensor chip. A customdeveloped rack system allows easy usage of multiple flasks in parallel within an incubator. The presented data demonstrates the application of the SCCF with braintumor (T98G) and breast cancer (T-47D) cells. Amperometric oxygen sensors wereused to monitor cellular respiration with different incubation conditions.Cellular acidification was accessed with potentiometric pH sensors usingelectrodeposited iridium oxide films. The system itself provides the foundationfor electrochemical monitoring systems in 3D cell culture.DOI: 10.3390/bios8020044 PMCID: PMC6022884PMID: 29701726
