Email: at35@aub.edu.lbBackground: Despite pain awareness and the development of treatment guidelines,cancer-related pain assessment and management remain suboptimal. Our objectiveswere to estimate the prevalence and severity of pain and its interference withdaily activities, and evaluate adequacy of treatment in cancer patients inLebanon. Methods: A total of 400 cancer patients aged 18 and above wereinterviewed at the American University of Beirut Medical Center surgical andmedical oncology floors, outpatient clinics and chemotherapy units from March2016-February 2017. The subjects covered were socio-demographics, clinical data, and presence of pain in the past month with use of the Brief Pain Inventoryquestionnaire. Descriptive statistics were conducted using t-test, chi-square andFischer’s exact tests. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to examinerelationships between pain severity and pain interference. Logistic regressionwas employed to determine risk factors for pain. Results: The majority ofparticipants were Lebanese (76.0%), females (62.7%), married (80.2%), of Muslimfaith (64.2%), of urban residence (85.8%), and with insurance plans (81.3%). Mosthad breast cancer (38.8%), were stage 4 (52.7%) and underwent a combination ofsurgery and systemic therapy (55.1%). The prevalence of pain in the past monthwas 29.8%. Among patients with pain, the highest proportion had moderate pain(37.8%) and around 46% received inadequate treatment. Conclusion: More awareness about cancer-related pain is needed to improve pain management and encouragereferral to palliative care and pain specialists early-on in diagnosis ofdisease.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.3.769 PMCID: PMC5980854PMID: 29582633
