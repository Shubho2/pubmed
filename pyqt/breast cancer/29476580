Epub 2018 Feb 24.The case for the omission of axillary staging in invasive breast carcinoma thatexhibits a predominant tubular growth pattern on preoperative biopsy.Ramzi S(1), Hyett EL(1), Wheal AS(2), Cant PJ(1).Author information: (1)Primrose Beast Care Centre, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, UK.(2)Department of Cellular & Anatomical Pathology, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth,UK.True invasive tubular breast carcinoma (TBC) is unlikely to metastasize toaxillary nodes, yet it is routinely subjected to sentinel lymph node biopsy(SLNB), even if the diagnosis was suspected preoperatively. The positivepredictive value (PPV) of core biopsy for TBC and the incidence and predictors ofaxillary metastasis in invasive breast carcinomas identified as tubular-rich oncore biopsy are unknown. Prospective patient and tumor data regardingpostoperatively confirmed TBCs, and tubular-rich carcinoma identified onpreoperative core biopsy between January 2005 and May 2016 was analyzedretrospectively. Axillary metastasis occurred in only 4.2% (4/95) of TBCs, all ofwhich measured >15 mm pathologically. In 11.1% (11/99) of TBCs, the initial core biopsy was either indeterminate/suspicious or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS);therefore, their true tubular histotype and size were ascertained followingoperative excision and before SLNB. Nine were ≤15 mm, and all were node-negative.Only 63.9% (46/72) of tubular-rich core biopsies were confirmed as TBCs; theremaining 36.1% (26/72) were well-differentiated invasive nontubular carcinomas. None of the preoperative patient or tumor features were predictive of true TBC onmultivariable analysis; 10.1% (7/69) of carcinomas identified as tubular-rich on core biopsy (regardless of their true histotypes) were node-positive; 23.1%(6/26) in nontubular and 2.3% (1/43) in true tubular carcinomas. Preoperativeultrasound size >15 mm was associated with axillary metastasis in 40.0% (4/10)compared to 5.7% (3/53) in those ≤15 mm (OR = 11.11, 95% CI = 1.99-62.04;multivariable P = .010). Axillary metastasis in TBC is dependent on pathological size; therefore, a case is made for omitting SLNB in small true TBCs confirmedfollowing excision. Preoperative tubular-rich core biopsy is not adequatelydiagnostic of TBC; however, it selects carcinomas that are well-differentiated,small, and unlikely to metastasize to the axilla, thus allowing for the selectiveomission of SLNB.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13000 PMID: 29476580
