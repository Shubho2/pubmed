Argentina.ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters are transmembrane proteins expressed insecretory epithelia like the liver, kidneys and intestine, in epitheliaexhibiting barrier function such as the blood-brain barrier and placenta, and to a much lesser extent, in tissues like reproductive organs, lungs, heart andpancreas, among others. They regulate internal distribution of endogenousmetabolites and xenobiotics including drugs of therapeutic use and alsoparticipate in their elimination from the body. We here describe the function andregulation of ABC transporters in heart and small intestine, as examples ofextrahepatic tissues, in which ABC proteins play clearly different roles. Inheart, they are involved in tissue pathogenesis as well as in protecting thisorgan against toxic compounds and drug-induced oxidative stress. The smallintestine is highly exposed to therapeutic drugs taken orally and, consequently, ABC transporters localized on its surface strongly influence drug absorption and pharmacokinetics. Examples of the ABC proteins currently described are Multidrug Resistance-associated Proteins 1 and 2 (MRP1 and 2) for heart and smallintestine, respectively, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer ResistanceProtein (BCRP) for both organs.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/0929867325666180327092639 PMID: 29589524
