In order to reduce the toxicity of PTX and increase the anti-tumoreffect, folate-modified amphiphilic and biodegradable biomaterial was developedto co-deliver PTX and metformin (MET) for exerting the synergistic effect. PTXwas physically entrapped in the hydrophobic inner core of the amphiphilic blockcopolymer by a solvent evaporation method, whereas MET was chemically conjugated to the hydrophilic terminals of copolymer via a pH-sensitive cis-aconityl linkage(Cis). The in vitro release behaviors of the drugs were analyzed byhigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the synergistic effect of the drugs was evaluated by a Q value method. Results showed that drug-loaded micelleswith an average size about 100Â nm were successfully constructed. In acidicenvironments, the chemically conjugated MET was rapidly released after thebreakage of sensitive bond between drug and copolymer. In vitro anti-tumorstudies demonstrated that MET and PTX had a synergistic effect and co-deliverymicelles induced higher cytotoxicity and apoptosis against 4T1 breast cancercells than free drugs. Furthermore, folate-targeted co-delivery micellesincreased the cellular uptake of drugs and were found to be effective for thetreatment of solid tumor in vivo. These findings indicated that co-delivery ofMET and PTX through the polymeric micelles is a promising strategy for cancertherapy.DOI: 10.1208/s12249-018-1070-8 PMID: 29869309
