Therefore, we constructed anovel dual-targeted nanosized US contrast agent (UCA) directed at both vascularendothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 (HER2) based on perfluoropropane (C3F8)-filled poly(lactic-co-glycolicacid) (PLGA) (NBs) for breast cancer detection. In vitro, single- ordual-targeted PLGA NBs showed high target specificities and better effects oftarget enhancement in VEGFR2 or HER2-positive cells. In vivo, US imaging signalin the murine breast cancer model was significantly higher (P < 0.01) fordual-targeted NBs than single-targeted and non-targeted NBs. Small animalfluorescence imaging further confirmed the special affinity of the dual-targeted nanosized contrast agent to both VEGFR2 and HER2. Immunofluorescence andimmunohistochemistry staining confirmed the expressions of VEGFR2 and HER2 ontumor neovasculature and tumor cells of breast cancer. In conclusions, thefeasibility of using dual-targeted PLGA NBs to enhance ultrasonic images isdemonstrated in vitro and in vivo. This may be a promising approach to targetbiomarkers of breast cancer for two site-specific US molecular imaging.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-21502-x PMCID: PMC5832866PMID: 29497045
