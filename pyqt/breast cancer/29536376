However, these trials included only several invasive lobularcarcinoma (ILC) cases, and the validity of omitting ALND for ILC remainscontroversial. Here, we examined whether omitting ALND is feasible in ILCtreatment.METHODS: A total of 3771 breast cancer patients underwent surgery for breastcancer at the Aichi Cancer Center Hospital between January 2006 and December2015. We excluded patients with neoadjuvant therapy or without axillarymanagement, and identified 184 ILC patients and 2402 invasive ductal carcinoma(IDC) patients. We compared SLN and non-SLN metastasis rates and the number oftotal ALN metastases between the ILC and IDC cohorts, and we examined the factorsthat influenced non-SLN metastasis in the SLN micrometastasis group.RESULTS: SLN biopsies were performed in 171 (93%) ILC and 2168 (90%) IDC cases,and 31 (18%) ILC and 457 (21%) IDC cases were SLN micrometastasis andmacrometastasis (p = 0.36). Among SLN macrometastasis patients, 17 (68%) ILCcases and 163 (46%) IDC cases showed non-SLN metastasis (p = 0.03). The number ofnon-SLN metastases was greater in ILC cases compared with IDC cases. Multivariateanalysis showed that ILC was the influential factor predicting non-SLN metastasisin patients with SLN macrometastasis.CONCLUSION: ILC cases had more non-SLN metastasis than IDC cases amongSLN-positive cases, and ILC was an important factor for the prediction of non-SLNpositivity in SLN macrometastasis cases. Omitting ALND for ILC with positive SLNsrequires more consideration.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0852-x PMID: 29536376
