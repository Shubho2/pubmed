Mechanisms modulating the adaptive immune systemat the primary activation site - the draining lymph node (LN) - are lessinvestigated. Here we present tumor-caused histomorphological changes in tumordraining LNs of breast cancer patients, dependent on the localization (sentinelLN vs. non-sentinel LN), the tumor size, the intrinsic subtype and nodalmetastatic status. The quantitative morphological study was conducted in breastcancer patients with at least one sentinel LN and no neoadjuvant therapy. All LNswere annotated considering to their topographical location, stained for IgD/H&E, digitized and quantitatively analyzed. In 206 patients, 394 sentinels and 940non-sentinel LNs were categorized, comprising 40758 follicles and 7074 germinalcenters. Subtype specific immunomorphological patterns were detectable:Follicular density was higher in LNs of Her2 enriched hormone receptor positiveand triple-negative breast cancers whereas hormone receptor positive breastcancers showed more macrophage infiltrations in the LN cortex. Follicles arerounder in metastatic LNs and non-sentinel LNs. The identifiedimmunomorphological changes reflect different underlying immunomodulations takingplace in the tumor-draining LNs and should therefore be considered as possibleprognostic and predictive markers for LN metastasis and therapy associatedimmunomodulation.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-23629-3 PMCID: PMC5871837PMID: 29593307
