Curcumin (CUR) andsulforaphane (SF) have antitumor effects, but their application is limitedbecause of their low water solubility and poor oral bioavailability. To improvethe bioavailability and solubility of SF and CUR, we performed an innovativeco-delivery of them with PEGylated gold coated Fe3O4magnetic nanoparticles (PEGylated Fe3O4@Au NPs) to endorse SF and CUR maintenanceas an effective and promising antitumor drugs. The structure of the synthesizednanocarriers evaluated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy,scanning electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer, dynamic lightscattering and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results revealed thatthe zeta potential of CUR and SF-loaded NPs were about -15.4 mV and the averagesizes were 80.57 nm. They were monodispersed (polydispersity index = 0.161 ±0.016) in water with high drug-loading capacity and stability. CUR and SF wereencapsulated into NPs with loading capacity of 17.32 ± 0.023% and 16.74 ± 0.015% and the entrapment efficiency of 83.72 ± 0.14% and 81.20 ± 0.18% respectively.The in-vitro study of SF and CUR loaded PEGylated Fe3O4@Au NPs on human breastadenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7) confirmed that cytotoxicity of SF and CUR canenhance when they are loaded on PEGylated Fe3O4@Au NPs in comparison to free SFand CUR. The results of real-time PCR and flow cytometry shown that thiscombination can increase therapeutic effects of SF and CUR by apoptosis andnecrosis induction as well as inhibiting of migration in MCF-7 cell line.PMCID: PMC5985166PMID: 29881406
