We assessed the relationship between pre-diagnostic plasmapolyphenols and colon cancer risk in a case-control study nested within theEuropean Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Using highpressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, we measuredconcentrations of 35 polyphenols in plasma from 809 incident colon cancer casesand 809 matched controls. We used multivariable adjusted conditional logisticregression models that included established colon cancer risk factors. The false discovery rate (qvalues ) was computed to control for multiple comparisons. Allstatistical tests were two-sided. After false discovery rate correction and incontinuous log2 -transformed multivariable models, equol (odds ratio [OR] perlog2 -value, 0.86, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.79-0.93; qvalue  = 0.01) and homovanillic acid (OR per log2 -value, 1.46, 95% CI = 1.16-1.84; qvalue = 0.02) were associated with colon cancer risk. Comparing extreme fifths, equol concentrations were inversely associated with colon cancer risk (OR = 0.61, 95%CI = 0.41-0.91, ptrend  = 0.003), while homovanillic acid concentrations werepositively associated with colon cancer development (OR = 1.72, 95%CI = 1.17-2.53, ptrend  < 0.0001). No heterogeneity for these associations wasobserved by sex and across other colon cancer risk factors. The remainingpolyphenols were not associated with colon cancer risk. Higher equolconcentrations were associated with lower risk, and higher homovanillic acidconcentrations were associated with greater risk of colon cancer. These findings support a potential role for specific polyphenols in colon tumorigenesis.© 2018 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley & SonsLtd on behalf of UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31563 PMID: 29696648
