The biliaryexcretion fractions of both statins were clearly observed, which weresignificantly decreased dependent on the concentration of Ko143, an inhibitor forbreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Ko143 also decreased the basolateralefflux fraction of RSV, whereas that of PTV was not significantly affected. Tounderstand these phenomena, effects of Ko143 on biliary excretion (BCRP andmultidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2) and basolateral efflux (MRP3 andMRP4) transporters were examined using transporter-expressing membrane vesicles. BCRP, MRP3 and MRP4-mediated transport of RSV was observed, and Ko143 inhibitedthese transporters except MRP3. BCRP and MRP4 also mediated the transport of PTV,but the Ko143-mediated inhibition was only clear for BCRP. These results mightexplain the Ko143-mediated complete and partial inhibition of the biliaryexcretion and the basolateral efflux of RSV, respectively, in SCHH. Inconclusion, D-PREX with sequential sampling of supernatants prior to cell lysisenables the evaluation of total drug disposition profiles resulting from complex interplays of intracellular pathways, which would provide high-throughputevaluation of drug disposition during drug discovery.Copyright Â© 2018 The Japanese Society for the Study of Xenobiotics.
