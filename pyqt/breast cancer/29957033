China .To identify signature genes for the pathogenesis of cancer, which provides atheoretical support for prevention and early diagnosis of cancer. The patternrecognition method was used to analyze the genome-wide gene expression data,which was collected from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. For thetranscription of invasive breast carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamouscell carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, renal clear-cell carcinoma, thyroidcarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma of the seven cancers, the signature geneswere selected by means of a combination of statistical methods, such ascorrelation, t-test, confidence interval, etc. Modeling by artificial neuralnetwork model, the accuracy can be as high as 98% for the TCGA data and as highas 92% for the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) independent data, the recognitionaccuracy of stage I is more than 95%, which is higher compared with the previous study. The common genes emerging in five cancers were obtained from the signaturegenes of seven cancers, PID1, and SPTBN2. At the same time, we obtain threecommon pathways of cancer by using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes'pathway analysis. A functional analysis of the pathways shows their closerelationship at the level of gene regulation, which indicted that the identified signature genes play an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer and is very important for understanding the pathogenesis of cancer and the early diagnosis.DOI: 10.1089/cmb.2017.0261 PMID: 29957033
