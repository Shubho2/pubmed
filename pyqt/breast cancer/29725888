This study investigates theimpact of germline BRCA1/2 mutations on pathological complete response andprognosis in patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy.METHODS: Breast cancer patients were tested for a BRCA1/2 mutation in clinicalroutine work and were treated with anthracycline-based or platinum-basedneoadjuvant chemotherapy between 1997 and 2015. These patients were identified inthe tumor registry of the Breast Center of the University of Erlangen (Germany). Logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate theassociations between BRCA1/2 mutation status, pathological complete response,disease-free survival, and overall survival.RESULTS: Among 355 patients, 59 had a mutation in BRCA1 or in BRCA2 (16.6%), 43in BRCA1 (12.1%), and 16 in BRCA2 (4.5%). Pathological complete response defined as "ypT0; ypN0" was observed in 54.3% of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, but only in22.6% of non-carriers. The adjusted odds ratio was 2.48 (95% CI 1.26-4.91) forBRCA1/2 carriers versus non-carriers. Patients who achieved a pathologicalcomplete response had better disease-free survival and overall survival ratescompared with those who did not achieve a pathological complete response,regardless of BRCA1/2 mutation status.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA1/2 mutation status leads to better responses to neoadjuvantchemotherapy in breast cancer. Pathological complete response is the mainpredictor of disease-free survival and overall survival, independently of BRCA1/2mutation status.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4797-8 PMID: 29725888
