Our aim is toinvestigate the clinical aspects of malignancy during pregnancy in Japan and touse this information to identify opportunities for earlier detection andtreatment.METHODS: We provided a questionnaire to 1508 secondary or tertiary care hospitalsin Japan. We reviewed the clinical characteristics of cases with malignancyduring pregnancy for the period of January to December, 2008. From the 760institutions which responded, we obtained clinical information for 227 uniquecases. The questionnaire provided clinical information, including disease site,pregnancy outcome and how the disease was detected.RESULTS: The most common type of malignancy was cervical cancer (n = 162, 71.4%) followed by ovarian (n = 16, 7.0%) and breast cancer (n = 15, 6.6%). Leukemia(n = 7, 3.1%), colon cancer (n = 5, 2.2%), gastric cancer (n = 5, 2.2%),malignant lymphoma (n = 4, 1.8%), thyroid cancer (n = 3, 1.3%), brain cancer(n = 3, 1.3%), endometrial cancer (n = 2, 0.9%), and head and neck cancer (n = 2,0.9%) accounted for the remaining cases. Overall, gynecological malignanciesaccounted for 79.3% (95% confidence interval 74.0-84.6) of pregnancy associatedmalignancies diagnosed in the present study. The majority of cervical cancers,149 (92.0%) of 162, were diagnosed by a Pap (Papanicolaou) smear during earlygestation. Ten (62.5%) of the ovarian cancer cases were diagnosed byultrasonography during a prenatal checkup or at the time of initial pregnancydiagnosis. Out of 14 breast cancers, only one (7.1%) was diagnosed by screeningbreast exam.CONCLUSIONS: From this study, we reaffirm the clear and significant benefits ofprenatal checkups starting at an early gestational age for the detection ofgynecological cancers during pregnancy. Conversely, breast cancer detectionduring pregnancy was poor, suggesting new strategies for early identification of this disease are required.DOI: 10.1186/s12884-018-1678-4 PMCID: PMC5806462PMID: 29422016
