Electrochemotherapy is used bydermatologists, surgeons, and oncologists, and for different degrees andmanifestations of metastases to skin and primary skin tumours not amenable tosurgery. This treatment utilises electric pulses to permeabilize cell membranesin tumours, thus allowing a dramatic increase of the cytotoxicity of anti-cancer agents. Response rates, often after only one treatment, are very high across all tumour types. The most frequent indications are cutaneous metastases frommalignant melanoma and breast cancer. In 2006, standard operating procedures(SOPs) were written for this novel technology, greatly facilitating introduction and dissemination of the therapy. Since then considerable experience has beenobtained treating a wider range of tumour histologies and increasing size oftumours which was not originally thought possible. A pan-European expert paneldrawn from a range of disciplines from dermatology, general surgery, head andneck surgery, plastic surgery, and oncology met to form a consensus opinion toupdate the SOPs based on the experience obtained. This paper contains theseupdated recommendations for indications for electrochemotherapy, pre-treatmentinformation and evaluation, treatment choices, as well as follow-up.DOI: 10.1080/0284186X.2018.1454602 PMID: 29577784
