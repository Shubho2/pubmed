Here, we show that M- and E-BCSCs rely on distinct metabolicpathways and display markedly different sensitivities to inhibitors of glycolysisand redox metabolism. Metabolic or oxidative stress generated by 2DG, H2O2, orhypoxia promotes the transition of ROSlo M-BCSCs to a ROShi E-state. Thistransition is reversed by N-acetylcysteine and mediated by activation of theAMPK-HIF1α axis. Moreover, E-BCSCs exhibit robust NRF2-mediated antioxidantresponses, rendering them vulnerable to ROS-induced differentiation andcytotoxicity following suppression of NRF2 or downstream thioredoxin (TXN) andglutathione (GSH) antioxidant pathways. Co-inhibition of glycolysis and TXN andGSH pathways suppresses tumor growth, tumor-initiating potential, and metastasis by eliminating both M- and E-BCSCs. Exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities ofdistinct BCSC states provides a novel therapeutic approach targeting thiscritical tumor cell population.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
