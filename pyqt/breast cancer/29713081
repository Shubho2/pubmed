Here we exploited the long reads of the nanopore platform using our customized pipeline, Picky ( https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/Picky ), to reveal SVs of diversearchitecture in a breast cancer model. We identified the full spectrum of SVswith superior specificity and sensitivity relative to short-read analyses, anduncovered repetitive DNA as the major source of variation. Examination ofgenome-wide breakpoints at nucleotide resolution uncovered micro-insertions asthe common structural features associated with SVs. Breakpoint density across thegenome is associated with the propensity for interchromosomal connectivity andwas found to be enriched in promoters and transcribed regions of the genome.Furthermore, we observed an over-representation of reciprocal translocations fromchromosomal double-crossovers through phased SVs. We demonstrate that Pickyanalysis is an effective tool for comprehensive detection of SVs in cancergenomes from long-read data.DOI: 10.1038/s41592-018-0002-6 PMCID: PMC5990454 [Available on 2018-10-30]PMID: 29713081
