Theiroestrogenic activity and presence in human milk suggest a potential to influence breast cancer development. In this study, high-performance liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure concentrations ofthese UV filters in human breast tissue from three serial locations across thebreast from 40 women undergoing mastectomy for primary breast cancer. One or moreof these UV filters were quantifiable in 101 of 120 (84%) of the tissue samplesand at least one breast region for 38 of 40 women. BP-3 was measured in 83 of 120(69%) tissue samples and at least one breast region for 33 of 40 women (range0-26.0 ng g-1 tissue). OMC was measured in 89 of 120 (74%) tissue samples and at least one breast region for 33 of 40 women (range 0-58.7 ng g-1 tissue). 4-MBCwas measured in 15 of 120 (13%) tissue samples and at least one breast region forseven of 40 women (range 0-25.6 ng g-1 tissue). Homosalate was not detected inany sample. Spearman's analyses showed significant positive correlations between concentrations of BP-3 and OMC in each of the three breast regions. For ethicalreasons cancerous tissue was not available, but as the location of the cancer wasknown, Mann-Whitney U-tests investigated any link between chemical concentration and whether a tumour was present in that region or not. For the lateral region,more BP-3 was measured when a tumour was present (P = .007) and for OMC the Pvalue was .061. For seven (of 40) women with measurable 4-MBC, six of seven hadmeasurable 4-MBC at the site of the tumour.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/jat.3621 PMID: 29658634
