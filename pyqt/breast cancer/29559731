We investigated preventive behaviour, cancer riskperception and readiness to change an unhealthy lifestyle in persons with andwithout an FDR with cancer.METHODS: Using an online questionnaire, we conducted a cross-sectional study inGermany including persons (≥35 years) with an FDR with colorectal, lung,prostate, breast, stomach or cervical/uterine cancer (n = 621) and personswithout cancer in FDRs (n = 303). Quota sampling ensured similar age and sexdistributions in both groups.RESULTS: Unfavourable lifestyle factors were equally common in both groups. Theproportion perceiving an increased cancer risk significantly differed(p < 0.0001) with 4% among respondents without cancer in FDRs and 18% (colorectalcancer) to 30% (stomach cancer) among cancer patients' relatives. The proportion of smokers ready to quit smoking was significantly higher among those perceiving an increased vs. a lower cancer risk (64 vs. 46%, p = 0.04). There was a similar association for readiness to increase physical activity and consumption offruits/vegetables and to reduce alcohol consumption.CONCLUSIONS: Given the increased risk perception and motivation to change anunhealthy lifestyle, our study provides a strong rationale for research on theeffectiveness of lifestyle interventions in cancer patients' relatives.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0057-2 PMID: 29559731
