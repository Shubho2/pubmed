The postoperative scars after endoscopic thyroidectomy may modify the estimation of recurrence. To achieve improve cosmesis and the accuracy offollow-up examination, we developed a novel method for thyroid surgery:hybrid-type endoscopic thyroidectomy (HET). Here we report two cases of doubleprimary cancer, one synchronous and the other metachronous. HET lobectomy and HETtotal thyroidectomy were performed in combination with some modifications ofbreast surgery. In each case, the postoperative course was uneventful, andcosmetic satisfaction was very high. Furthermore, there were no problems duringthe follow-up period. Based on our results, HET could become a standardizedtreatment of double primary cancers.Â© 2018 Japan Society for Endoscopic Surgery, Asia Endosurgery Task Force and JohnWiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ases.12426 PMID: 29869842
