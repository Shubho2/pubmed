The ROC curve of continuous variables was drawn according toresistance situation, then they were grouped by age (< 48 or ≥ 48 years), tumorsize (< 7 cm or ≥ 7 cm) and Ca125 (< 90 and ≥ 90 U/ml). In univariate analysis,age ≥ 48 years, initial symptom of abdominal distension or weight loss, abnormal preoperative serum Ca125, Ca125 < 90 U/ml, advanced FIGO stage, absence ofendometriosis, bilateral tumors, lack of lymphadenectomy, positive lymph nodes,unsatisfactory initial cytoreduction surgery and history of breast cancer wereall related to drug resistance in ovarian cancer. In multivariate analysis,advanced stage, lack of lymphadenectomy, positive lymph nodes and history ofbreast cancer were independent risk factors related to platinum-based drugresistance (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: For patients of endometriosis-related ovarian cancer, platinum-based drug resistance were associated with advanced FIGO stage, lack oflymphadenectomy, positive lymph nodes and history of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13048-018-0418-8 PMCID: PMC5975270PMID: 29843765
