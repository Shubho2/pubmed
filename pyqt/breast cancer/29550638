Electronic address:qianqian_dr@163.com.Our previous study has showed doublecortin like kinase 1 (DCLK1) serves as anoncogene to regulate basal-like breast cancer cell proliferation, migration andinvasion, and is associated with malignant status and poor prognosis. The aim of this study is to identify microRNAs (miRNAs), which target DCLK1 to regulatebasal-like breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In ourresults, we observed that miR-424-5p expression was decreased in basal-likebreast cancer tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, we found 3'-UTR of DCLK1 hadbinding site of miR-424-5p based on microRNA target databases, and there was aninverse correlation between miR-424-5p and DCLK1 in basal-like breast cancertissues. Moreover, we confirmed miR-424-5p directly targeted to 3'-UTR of DCLK1through luciferase reporter assay, and miR-424-5p negatively regulated DCLK1 mRNAand protein expressions through qRT-PCR and western blot. The gain-of-functionstudies showed that miR-424-5p suppressed basal-like breast cancer cellproliferation, migration and invasion. The rescued-function studies suggestedup-regulation of DCLK1 could rescue inhibition of miR-424-5p mimics in theregulation of basal-like breast cancer cell proliferation, migration andinvasion. Finally, low-expression of miR-424-5p was associated with advancedclinical stage, large tumor size, more metastatic lymph nodes, present distantmetastasis and poor histological grade in basal-like breast cancer patients. Inconclusion, miR-424-5p is a tumor suppressive microRNA to regulate tumor cellproliferation, migration and invasion via binding to the functional target DCLK1,and associated with malignant status in basal-like breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
