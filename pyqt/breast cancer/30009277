Grade 3/4 neutropenia is a common side effect although febrileneutropenia is relatively uncommon. Insufficient data exist to describe thehematological safety of palbociclib in African American women (AAW) known to havea high incidence of benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN). PALOMA 1, 2 and 3, theinitial phase II/III studies that led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) approval of palbociclib in metastatic breast cancer, only includedparticipants with baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1500/mm3 or higher.African American women (AAW) were underrepresented in the PALOMA trials and this may be partially explained by strict requirements for minimal ANC â‰¥1500/mm3. The ANC of 1500/mm3 for initiation of treatment in those with BEN has been previouslychallenged. In this study, we propose to lower the ANC cutoff for enrollment to1000/mm3. PALINA (NCT02692755) is a phase II, single arm, multicenter clinicaltrial that will enroll 35 patients. The primary endpoint is to assess theproportion of patients who complete therapy without the development of febrileneutropenia or treatment discontinuation due to neutropenia. The secondaryendpoints include number of patients who required dose delays or dose reductions in palbociclib attributed to neutropenia, rate of grade 3/4 neutropenia, clinicalbenefit rate at 24 weeks, the association between metabolite and exosomalsignature with disease response and the association between baseline ANC prior tocancer diagnosis and the Duffy Null polymorphism (SNP rs2814778) withhematological safety. PALINA will provide important information about thehematologic safety of palbociclib in AAW with advanced breast cancer.DOI: 10.1016/j.conctc.2018.05.012 PMCID: PMC6042467PMID: 30009277
