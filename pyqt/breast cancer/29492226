Part 2: ADCmin.Surov A(1), Meyer HJ(1), Wienke A(2).Author information: (1)Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.(2)Institute of Medical Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Informatics,Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany.The purpose of this part of the meta-analysis was to summarize data regardingassociations between minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin) and KI 67 indifferent tumors. MEDLINE library was screened for associations between ADCminand KI 67 in different tumors up to April 2017. Overall, 23 studies with 944patients were identified. Associations between ADC and KI 67 were analyzed bySpearman's correlation coefficient. The pooled correlation coefficient betweenADCmin and KI 67 for all included tumors was ρ = -0.47. In detail, thecorrelation coefficients for separate tumors were as follows: cerebral lymphoma: ρ = -0.61 (95% CI = [-0.82; -0.41]); cervical cancer: ρ = -0.56 (95% CI =[-0.68;-0.43]); pituitary adenoma: ρ = -0.55 (95% CI = [-1.31; 0.22]); glioma: ρ = -0.40 (95% CI = [-0.55; -0.24]); breast cancer: ρ = -0.37 (95% CI = [-0.74;-0.01]); meningioma, ρ = -0.15 (95% CI = [-0.38; 0.07]).DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24006 PMCID: PMC5823566PMID: 29492226
