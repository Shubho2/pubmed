No study to date has assessed the acute and long-term effects of year-longaerobic exercise programs differing in prescribed exercise volume on physicalactivity and sedentary time in postmenopausal women. Therefore, we aimed toexamine the effects of two moderate-vigorous intensity exercise doses on total,light and moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity times, and sedentary timein postmenopausal women during the year-long intervention and one year later.METHODS: The Breast Cancer and Exercise Trial in Alberta (BETA) was a two-center,two-arm, 12-month randomized controlled trial that included 400 previouslyinactive postmenopausal women randomized to either 150 (MODERATE) or 300 (HIGH)minutes/week of aerobic exercise. Physical activity and sedentary time wereassessed at baseline, 6- (intervention mid-point), 12- (prior to end ofintervention) and 24-months (follow-up) with waist-mounted accelerometers(Actigraph GTX3Â®). Self-reported activity and sedentary time at baseline, 12- and24-months was also assessed (Past Year Total Physical Activity Questionnaire and SIT-Q). Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted using linear mixed models and adjusted for baseline variables.RESULTS: Both physical activity interventions led to increases in objective andsubjective measures of total and moderate-vigorous intensity/recreationalphysical activity time, coupled with decreases in sedentary time, at 6- and12-months compared to baseline. Additionally, greater increases inaccelerometry-derived total physical activity time at 6- and 12-months, andself-reported recreational activity time at 12-months, compared to baseline were noted in the HIGH versus MODERATE groups. Decreases in total, light andmoderate-vigorous intensity physical activity time, and an increase in sedentary time, in both groups were noted at 24-months compared to 12-months. A decrease inlight intensity physical activity time in both groups at 24-months compared tobaseline was also noted.CONCLUSION: These findings have important health implications, suggesting thattotal physical activity time can be increased with greater volumes of prescribed exercise, but that additional support and resources could be used to promote the maintenance of these high levels of aerobic exercise participation followingstudy completion.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01435005 (BETA Trial).Registred September 15th 2011 (retrospectively registered).DOI: 10.1186/s12966-018-0659-3 PMCID: PMC5863375PMID: 29562927
