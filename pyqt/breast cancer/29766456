Here, we explore theprognostic role of the derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR), acrossdifferent tumor subtypes, in patients with early breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 1246 patients withlymph node-positive, operable early breast cancer enrolled in the GEICAM/9906trial, a multicenter randomized phase 3 study evaluating adjuvant chemotherapy.dNLR was calculated as the ratio of neutrophils and the difference between total leukocytes and neutrophils in peripheral blood before chemotherapy. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival were explored using a Cox proportional hazardanalysis.RESULTS: The analysis comprised 1243 (99.8%) patients with dNLR data, with amedian follow-up of 10 years. Data on intrinsic subtypes were available from 818 (66%) patients (luminal A 34%, luminal B 32%, HER2-enriched 21% and basal-like9%). Median dNLR was 1.35 [interquartile range (IQR) 1.08-1.71]. In the wholepopulation, dNLR was not prognostic after adjustment for clinico-pathologicalfactors. However, dNLR ≥ 1.35 was independently associated with worse DFS in the hormone receptor-negative/HER2+ population (HR 2.86; p = 0.038) and in patientswith one to three lymph node metastases (HR 1.32, p = 0.032). There was anon-significant association with worse DFS in non-luminal and in HER2-enrichedtumors (HR 1.40, p = 0.085 and HR 1.53, p = 0.067). No significant interactionwas observed between the treatment arm and dNLR.CONCLUSION: Elevated dNLR appears to be an adverse prognostic factor in hormonereceptor-negative early breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT: 2005-003108-12 (retrospectively registered28/06/2005).
