Manymammary gland diseases, such as breast cancer, arise from abnormalities in themammary epithelium, which is mainly composed of two distinct lineages, the basal and luminal cells. Because of the limitation of traditional transcriptomeanalysis of bulk mammary cells, the hierarchy and heterogeneity of mammary cells within these two lineages remain unclear. To this end, using single-cell RNA-Seq coupled with FACS analysis and principal component analysis, we determined geneexpression profiles of mammary epithelial cells of virgin and pregnant mice.These analyses revealed a much higher heterogeneity among the mammary cells than has been previously reported and enabled cell classification into distinctsubgroups according to signature gene markers present in each group. We alsoidentified and verified a rare CDH5+ cell subpopulation within a basal celllineage as quiescent mammary stem cells (MaSCs). Moreover, using pseudo-temporal analysis, we reconstructed the developmental trajectory of mammary epithelia and uncovered distinct changes in gene expression and in biological functions ofmammary cells along the developmental process. In conclusion, our work greatlyrefines the resolution of the cellular hierarchy in developing mammary tissues.The discovery of CDH5+ cells as MaSCs in these tissues may have implications for our understanding of the initiation, development, and pathogenesis of mammarytumors.Â© 2018 Sun et al.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.002297 PMCID: PMC5986215 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29666189
