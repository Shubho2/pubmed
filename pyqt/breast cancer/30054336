studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 35 loci associated with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) risk. The majority ofGWAS-identified disease susceptibility variants are located in non-codingregions, and causal genes underlying these associations remain largely unknown.Here we performed a transcriptome-wide association study to search for novelgenetic loci and plausible causal genes at known GWAS loci. We used RNAsequencing data (68 normal ovarian-tissue samples from 68 individuals and 6,124cross-tissue samples from 369 individuals) and high-density genotyping data from European descendants of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx V6) project to buildovarian and cross-tissue models of genetically regulated expression using elasticnet methods. We evaluated 17,121 genes for their cis-predicted gene expression inrelation to EOC risk using summary statistics data from GWAS of 97,898 women,including 29,396 EOC cases. With a Bonferroni-corrected significance level ofP<2.2×10-6, we identified 35 genes including FZD4 at 11q14.2 (Z=5.08,P=3.83×10-7, the cross-tissue model; 1 Mb away from any GWAS-identified EOC risk variant), a potential novel locus for EOC risk. All other 34significantly-associated genes were located within 1 Mb of known GWAS-identified loci, including 23 genes at 6 loci not previously linked to EOC risk. Uponconditioning on nearby known EOC GWAS-identified variants, the associations for31 genes disappeared and 3 genes remained (P<1.47 x 10-3). These data identifyone novel locus (FZD4) and 34 genes at 13 known EOC risk loci associated with EOCrisk, providing new insights into EOC carcinogenesis.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-0951 PMID: 30054336
