Email: vothithuonglan@hus.edu.vn.(#)Contributed equallyObjective: This study investigated the DNA promoter methylation profiles ofBRCA1, RASSF1A and GSTP1 genes, both individually and in an integrative manner inorder to clarify their correlation with clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer from Vietnamese patients, and establish new potential integrativemethylation biomarkers for breast cancer detection. Material and methods: Themethylation frequencies of BRCA1, RASSF1A and GSTP1 were analyzed by methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in 70 specimens of breast carcinomas and79 pairs of tumor and matched adjacent normal tissues from breast cancerpatients. Results: All the three analyzed genes showed a concordance concerningtheir promoter methylation in tumor and adjacent normal tissue. The methylationof BRCA1, RASSF1A and GSTP1 was found in 58.23 %, 74.68 % and 59.49 % of tumortissues and 51.90 %, 63.29 % and 35.44 % of corresponding adjacent tissues,respectively. When each gene was assessed individually, only the methylation ofGSTP1 was significantly associated with tumor tissues (p=0.003). However, themethylation frequency of at least one of the three genes and the methylationfrequency of all the three genes both showed significant association with tumor(p=0.008 and p=0.04, respectively). The methylation of BRCA1 was found to besignificantly associated with tumor grade (p=0.01). Conclusion: This studyemphasized that the panel of the three genes BRCA1, RASSF1A and GSTP1 can befurther developed as potential biomarkers in diagnosis and classification ofbreast cancer in Vietnamese women.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.7.1887 PMID: 30049201
