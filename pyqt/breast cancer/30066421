[Epub ahead of print]Breast MRI phenotype and background parenchymal enhancement may predict tumorresponse to neoadjuvant endocrine therapy.Hilal T(1), Covington M(2), Kosiorek HE(3), Zwart C(2), Ocal IT(4), Pockaj BA(5),Northfelt DW(1), Patel BK(2).Author information: (1)Division of Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.(2)Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.(3)Department of Health Sciences Research, BioStatistics, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix,Arizona.(4)Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix,Arizona.(5)Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) is increasingly used for the treatment ofestrogen receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. We evaluated whether MRIphenotype and background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) can predict response toNET. Patients with localized breast cancer treated with NET and had apre-treatment breast MRI were identified. Baseline MRI phenotype and BPE wasinterpreted by a single radiologist blinded to the results of systemic therapy.Response was defined as stable disease or reduction in tumor size on clinicaland/or ultrasound examination. Of the 21 patients identified, 17 were responders;all patients with minimal/mild BPE had a response compared to 5/9 (56%) patients with moderate/marked BPE (P = 0.02). All four nonresponders had moderate/markedBPE as compared to 5/17 (29%) responders (P = 0.02). This pilot study suggeststhat minimal/mild BPE may be predictive of a positive response to NET. A higherdegree of background enhancement was significantly predictive of negativeresponse to NET.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13101 PMID: 30066421
