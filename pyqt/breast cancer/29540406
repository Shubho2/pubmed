The reasons for thisdecline remain controversial as several factors occurred almost simultaneously,including important advances in treatment approaches, breast cancer awareness andthe introduction of mammography screening programmes in many European countries. In Switzerland, mammography screening programmes (MSPs) have existed in someregions for over 20 years but do not yet exist in others. This offers thepossibility to analyse its effects with modern spatiotemporal methodology. Weaimed to assess the spatiotemporal patterns and the effect of MSPs on breastcancer mortality.SETTING: Switzerland.PARTICIPANTS: The study covers breast cancer deaths of the female population ofSwitzerland during the period 1969-2012. We retrieved data from the Swiss FederalStatistical Office aggregated on a small-area level.DESIGN: We fitted Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal models on death ratesindirectly standardised by national references. We used linguistic region, degreeof urbanisation, duration of population-based screening programmes andsocioeconomic index as covariates.RESULTS: In Switzerland, breast cancer mortality in women slightly increaseduntil 1989-1992 and declined strongly thereafter. Until 2009-2012, thestandardised mortality ratio declined to 57% (95% CI 54% to 60%) of the 1969-1972value. None of the other coefficients of the spatial regressions had asignificant effect on breast cancer mortality. In 2009-2012, no region hadsignificantly elevated or reduced breast cancer mortality at 95% credibleinterval level compared with the national mean.CONCLUSION: There has been a strong reduction of breast cancer mortality from the1990s onwards. No important spatial disparities were observed. The factorsstudied (urbanisation, language, duration of population-based MSP andsocioeconomic characteristics) did not seem to have an influence on them. Lowparticipation rates and opportunistic screening use may have contributed to thelow impact of MSPs.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
