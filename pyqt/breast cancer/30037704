Patient demographics were extracted via electronicmedical record. Natural language processing captured breast density, BI-RADSassignment, and current and prior screening examination findings. Radiologists'annual screening volumes, clinical experience, and concentration in breastimaging were calculated. Risk aversion, stress from uncertainty, and malpractice concerns were derived via survey. Univariate and multivariate analyses assessedpatient, radiologist, and examination characteristics associated with likelihood of mammography recall. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient wasused to assess the relationship between cancer detection rate and recall rate.RESULTS: Overall, 5,678 of 61,198 screening examinations (9.3%) were recalled. Inmultivariate analysis, patient and radiologist characteristics associated withhigher odds of recall included patient's age < 50 years (P < .0001), priormammographic findings (calcification [P < .0001], mass [P < .0001], higherdensity category [P < .0001]), baseline examination (P < .0001), annual readingvolume < 1,250 examinations (P = .0282), and <10 years of experience (P = .0036).Radiologist's risk aversion, stress from uncertainty, malpractice concerns, andcancer detection rates were not associated with higher recall rates (r = -0.36,P = .23).CONCLUSIONS: In addition to patient and examination factors, screening recallvariations were associated with radiologists' annual reading volume andexperience. Interventions targeting radiologist factors (screening volumes,second review of potential recalls) may help reduce unwarranted variation inscreening recall.Copyright © 2018 American College of Radiology.
