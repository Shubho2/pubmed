Folate Receptoralpha (FRα) is a central mediator of cell growth regulation that could serve asan important target for cancer therapy.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated FRα expression in breast cancers by genomic (N = 3414) and immunohistochemical (N = 323) analyses and its association withclinical parameters and outcomes. We measured the functional contributions of FRαin TNBC biology by RNA interference and the anti-tumor functions of an antibodyrecognizing FRα (MOv18-IgG1), in vitro and in human TNBC xenograft models.RESULTS: FRα is overexpressed in significant proportions of aggressive basallike/TNBC tumors, and in post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy-residual diseaseassociated with a high risk of relapse. Expression is associated with worseoverall survival. TNBCs show dysregulated expression of thymidylate synthase,folate hydrolase 1 and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, involved in folatemetabolism. RNA interference to deplete FRα decreased Src and ERK signaling andresulted in reduction of cell growth. An anti-FRα antibody (MOv18-IgG1)conjugated with a Src inhibitor significantly restricted TNBC xenograft growth.Moreover, MOv18-IgG1 triggered immune-dependent cancer cell death in vitro byhuman volunteer and breast cancer patient immune cells, and significantlyrestricted orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft growth.CONCLUSIONS: FRα is overexpressed in high-grade TNBC and post-chemotherapyresidual tumors. It participates in cancer cell signaling and presents apromising target for therapeutic strategies such as antibody-drug conjugates, or passive immunotherapy priming Fc-mediated anti-tumor immune cell responses.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0652 PMID: 30068707
