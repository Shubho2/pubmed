We sought to investigatethe effects of beta-blockers at the time of index surgery for breast, lung, andcolorectal cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using linked data from a provincial cancer registry, weconducted a retrospective matched cohort study comparing disease-specific andoverall survival between patients over age 64 exposed and not exposed tobeta-blockers before and after index surgical resection for breast, lung andcolorectal cancer between April 1st, 2002 and December 31st, 2010. Ahigh-dimensional propensity score was used to match patients and Cox proportionalhazard models were used to estimate relative risks of the outcomes.RESULTS: 30,020 patients were included in the final matched cohorts. Mean follow up time for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer was 57.6 ± 30.5, 43.1 ± 28.7, and53.4 ± 31.0 months, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for disease-specific mortality for patients exposed to beta-blockers was 1.03 (0.83-1.29) for breast, 1.05 (0.92-1.20) for lung, and 1.10 (0.96-1.25) for the colorectal cancer cohort.CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based study, no association betweenperioperative beta-blocker exposure and improved cancer-specific survival forbreast, lung, or colorectal cancer was demonstrated.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
