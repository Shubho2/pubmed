Of the 62 patients, 32 were female and 30 were male. The mean age of patients was 65 years (35 to 89). The primary malignancyoriginated from the breast in 27 (44%) patients, prostate in 15 (24%) patients,kidney in seven (11%), and lung in four (6%) of patients. One patient (2%) hadmetastatic carcinoma from the lacrimal gland, two patients (3%) had multiplemyeloma, one patient (2%) had lymphoma of bone, and five patients (8%) hadmetastatic carcinoma of unknown primary. Plain radiographs at the time of initialpresentation were scored using Mirels system by the four authors. Theradiographic components of the score (anatomical site, size, and radiographicappearance) were scored two weeks apart. Inter- and intraobserver reliabilitywere calculated with Fleiss' kappa test. Bland-Altman plots were created tocompare the variances of the individual components of the score and the totalMirels score.Results: Kappa values for the interobserver variability of the components of the Mirels score were k = 0.554 (95% CI 0.483 to 0.626) for site, k = 0.342 (95% CI0.285 to 0.400) for size, k = 0.443 (95% CI 0.387 to 0.499) for radiographicappearance, and k = 0.294 (95% CI 0.258 to 0.331)for the total score. Kappavalues for the intra-observer reliability were k = 0.608 (95% CI 0.506 to 0.710) for site, k = 0.579 (95% CI 0.487 to 0.670) for size, k = 0.614 (95% CI 0.522 to 0.703) for radiographic appearance, and k = 0.323 (95% CI 0.266 to 0.379) fortotal score.Conclusion: Our study showed fair to moderate agreement between authors whenusing the Mirels score, and moderate to substantial agreement when authorsrescored radiographs. The Mirels score is subjective and lacks reproducibility inpredicting the risk of pathological fracture.
