However, for all LNMs (n=12) without ppCAFs, their pairedtumors also lacked ppCAFs. In both tumors and LNMs, ppCAFs were α-smooth muscleactin-positive and cluster of differentiation 21 protein-negative, suggestingthem not to be resident lymph node cells. Moreover, in our series, the presenceof ppCAFs in tumors was borderline related to poor disease-free survival(p=0.058). These results speak in favor of a hypothesis suggesting ppCAFsaccompany metastatic cancer cells migrating from tumor to LNMs.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12433 PMID: 29599311  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
