Since TGFA itself initiates autochthonoustumors in liver, breast, and pancreas but not in the lung in transgenic mice invivo, it would appear that an EGFR ligand may not initiate but rather promotelung cancer. However, it has not been proven in vivo whether lung cancer ispromoted by an EGFR ligand. Using transgenic mouse models conditionallyexpressing EGFRL858R or KrasG12D with TGFA (an EGFR ligand) in lung epithelium,we determined that TGFA promoted the growth of EGFRL858R-lung tumors in airwayregions but not that of KrasG12D-lung tumors. Analysis of TCGA datasetsidentified Î”Np63 and AGR2 as potential key tumor-promoting regulators, which werehighly induced in the TGFA-induced EGFRL858R-lung tumors. The expression of AGR2 was positively correlated with the expression of TGFA in human EGFR-mutant lungadenocarcinomas. The expression of TGFA in human EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomasbut not in the EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma was associated with poorsurvival. These results suggest that targeting EGFR ligands may benefit patients who carry EGFR-mutant lung tumors but will not benefit patients with KRAS-mutant lung tumors.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0240-1 PMID: 29662194
