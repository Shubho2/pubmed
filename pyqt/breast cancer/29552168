China.Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in females, with metastasis of thistype of cancer frequently proving lethal. However, there are still no effectivebiomarkers to predict breast cancer metastasis. The aim of the present study was,therefore, to analyze breast cancer metastasis-associated proteins and evaluatethe association between protein S100-A8 and the prognosis of breast cancer. Theisobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomic technique was used to analyze the differential expression of proteins between fresh primarybreast tumor (PBT) tissue and fresh paired metastatic lymph nodes (PMLN) tissue. Subsequently, immunohistochemical staining was used to locate and assess theexpression of protein S100-A8 in benign breast disease (n=15), primary breastcancer with (n=109) or without (n=83) metastasis, and in paired metastatic lymph nodes (n=109) formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. Staining scoreswere evaluated and the association between protein S100-A8 expression levels and the clinicopathological characteristics of 192 patients with breast cancer wereevaluated using the Ï‡2 test. Kaplan-Meier and Cox hazards regression analyseswere utilized to investigate the association between the expression of proteinS100-A8 and the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. A total of 4,837proteins were identified using the iTRAQ proteomic technique. Among theseproteins, 643 differentially expressed proteins were revealed. Protein S100-A8expression levels were identified to differ between PBT and PMLN tissues.Immunohistochemical staining suggested a significant difference between NMBT and PMLN (P=0.002), and also between PBT and PMLN (P<0.001). Cox hazards regressionmodel analyses suggested that histological grade (P=0.031) and nodal status(P=0.001) were risk factors for lymph nodes metastasis of breast cancer.Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed no significant relationship between proteinS100-A8 expression level and overall survival rate of patients with breastcancer. In conclusion, by using the iTRAQ proteomic technique andimmunohistochemistry staining, it was identified that protein S100-A8 may beassociated with lymph nodes metastasis of breast cancer and be a marker forprogression of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7958 PMCID: PMC5840668PMID: 29552168
