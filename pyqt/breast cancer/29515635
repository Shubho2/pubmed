Silibinin is a natural polyphenolic flavonoid with anti-cancer activity.We assessed the effects of silibinin on cell viability, maspin and ERα geneexpression in MCF-7 cell line.Methods: The human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was cultured in Dulbecco'sModified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) and treated with different concentrations ofsilibinin (100-600 μg/mL) for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The cytotoxic effect ofsilibinin on MCF-7 viability was determined using Methyl-Thiazolyl-Tetrazolium(MTT) assay by IC50 determination. The fold changes of Maspin and ERα expression were determined by reverse-transcription real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR). All experiments on the cells were performed in triplicates.Results: The maximum inhibitory effect of silibinin on cell viability wasobserved at 600 μg/mL after 72-hour incubation (p = 0.001). Incubation of thecells with silibinin for 48 and 72 hours significantly decreased IC50 values to250 and 207 μg/mL (p = 0.005 and p= 0.006), respectively. The expression ofmaspin and ERα in the treated cells compared to controls was significantlydecreased following treatment with different concentrations of silibinin during a24-hour period.Conclusions: Silibinin reduces both maspin and ERα gene expression in MCF-7 cell line. The therapeutic effect of silibinin on the treatment of breast cancer maybe mediated by the reduction of ERα expression. For verifying this hypothesis andthe possible therapeutic implication of silibinin on breast cancer, furtherstudies in this direction are necessary.PMCID: PMC5831069PMID: 29515635
