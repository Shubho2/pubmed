Electronic address: zhongcjnt001@126.com.The Kinesin family member 2a (KIF2A), that belongs to the Kinesin-13 microtubule depolymerases, plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation, migrationand apoptosis in various types of cancer such as gastric cancer, breast cancer,and squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue, but, its role and mechanism inlung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is largely unknown. The present study reported thatKIF2A was overexpressed in LUAD tissues as compared with adjacent normal tissues.KIF2A was closely correlated with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.01),whereas, no similar relationships between KIF2A and age, gender, smoking anddifferentiation. Multivariate analysis indicated that hyperexpression of KIF2A inLUAD was an independent risk factor for worse overall survival in LUAD patients(HR: 3.135, 95%CI: 1.331-7.112, p < 0.05). In vitro, KIF2A knockdown markedlyreduced LUAD cell A549 migration and could regulate epithelial-mesenchymaltransition. Furthermore, silencing KIF2A inhibited cell proliferation and inducedapoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma(LUAD) cells. In conclusion, KIF2A may serve as avaluable prognostic indicator and promising therapeutic target of LUAD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
