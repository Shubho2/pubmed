Many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the p53 pathway alter p53 transcriptional activity and are associated with cancer risk.In addition, some SNPs influence the gain-of-function (GOF) activities of mutant p53 through unknown mechanisms. In this issue of Genes & Development, Basu andcolleagues (pp. 230-243) provide direct evidence that the presence of an R72polymorphism enhances the GOF invasive and metastatic properties of mutant p53 byregulating interactions with PGC-1α, an important regulator of mitochondrialbiogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation. The study culminates with evidence thatR72 is associated with worse outcomes in human breast cancer.© 2018 Ortiz and Lozano; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.DOI: 10.1101/gad.312934.118 PMCID: PMC5859960PMID: 29491132
