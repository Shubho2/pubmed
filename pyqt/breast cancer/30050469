It benefits nearly 75% of patients with estrogenreceptor (ER)-positive breast cancer that receive this drug. Its effectiveness ismainly attributed to its capacity to function as an ER antagonist, blockingestrogen binding sites on the receptor, and inhibiting the proliferative actionof the receptor-hormone complex. Although, tamoxifen can induce apoptosis inbreast cancer cells via upregulation of pro-apoptotic factors, it can alsopromote uterine hyperplasia in some women. Thus, tamoxifen as a multi-functional drug could have different effects on cells based on the utilization of effective concentrations or availability of specific co-factors. Evidence that tamoxifenfunctions as a GPR30 (G-Protein Coupled Receptor 30) agonist activating adenylyl cyclase and EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) intracellular signalingnetworks, provides yet another means of explaining the multi-functionality oftamoxifen. Here ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling, RNA sequencing andreal time qPCR analysis were utilized to establish the necessary data for genenetwork mapping of tamoxifen-stimulated MCF-7 cells, which express the endogenousER and GPR30. The gene set enrichment analysis and pathway analysis approacheswere used to categorize transcriptionally upregulated genes in biologicalprocesses. Of the 2,713 genes that were significantly upregulated following a 48 h incubation with 250 Î¼M tamoxifen, most were categorized as eithergrowth-related or pro-apoptotic intermediates that fit into the Tp53 and/or MAPK signaling pathways. Collectively, our results display that the effects oftamoxifen on the breast cancer MCF-7 cell line are mediated by the activation of important signaling pathways including Tp53 and MAPKs to induce apoptosis.DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2018.00907 PMCID: PMC6050429PMID: 30050469
