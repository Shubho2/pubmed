Altered circadian rhythms can result from night-shift work, chronicjet lag, exposure to bright lights at night, or other conditioning, and have beenshown to lead to increased likelihood of cancer, metabolic and cardiovasculardiseases, and immune dysregulation. In cases of cancer, worse patient prognosesand drug resistance during treatment have also been observed. Breast, colon,prostate, lung, and ovarian cancers and hepatocellular carcinoma have all beenlinked in one way or another with altered circadian rhythms. Critical elements atthe molecular level of the circadian system have been associated with cancer, butthere have been fairly few studies in this regard. In this mini-review, wespecifically focus on the role of altered circadian rhythms in breast cancer,providing an overview of studies performed at the epidemiological level throughassessments made in animal and cellular models of the disease. We also addressthe disparities present among studies that take into account the rhythmicity ofcore clock and other proteins, and those which do not, and offer insights to the use of small molecules for studying the connections between circadian rhythms andcancer. This article will provide the reader with a concise, but thorough accountof the research landscape as it pertains to altered circadian rhythms and breast cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00219 PMCID: PMC5945923PMID: 29780357
