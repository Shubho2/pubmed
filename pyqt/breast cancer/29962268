Epub 2018 Jul 25.Risk of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia with same-day versus next-daypegfilgrastim prophylaxis among patients aged ≥65 years: a retrospectiveevaluation using Medicare claims.Weycker D(1), Hanau A(1), Lonshteyn A(1), Bowers C(2), Bensink M(2), GarawinT(2), Chandler D(2).Author information: (1)a Policy Analysis Inc. (PAI) , Brookline , MA , USA.(2)b Amgen Inc. , Thousand Oaks , CA , USA.BACKGROUND: Two recent evaluations reported that risk of febrile neutropenia (FN)may be higher when pegfilgrastim prophylaxis (PP) is administered on same day as chemotherapy rather than per recommendation (1-3 days following chemotherapy).Such evidence is based largely on the experience of younger privately insuredadults and may not be generalizable to older patients in US clinical practice.METHODS: A retrospective cohort design and data from Medicare Claims ResearchIdentifiable Files (January 2008-September 2015) were employed. Patients wereaged ≥65 years, had breast cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, receivedchemotherapy with intermediate/high risk for FN, and received PP in ≥1 cycle;cycles with PP were stratified based on administration day (same-day ["Day 0"]vs. 1-3 days following chemotherapy ["Days 1-3"]) and were pooled for analyses.Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for FN during the cycle were estimated for patientswho received PP on Day 0 versus Days 1-3.RESULTS: Study population included 65,003 patients who received PP in 261,184cycles; in 5% of cycles, patients received PP on Day 0. Incidence proportion for FN in cycle 1 was 11.4% for Day 0 versus 8.4% for Days 1-3; adjusted OR was 1.4(p < .001). Incidence proportion for FN when considering all cycles was 7.7% for Day 0 and 6.0% for Days 1-3; adjusted OR was 1.3 (p < .001). Adjusted ORs whenconsidering all cycles and only inpatient FN episodes (1.3, p < .001) and thenarrow definition for FN (1.5, p < .001) were similar.CONCLUSIONS: Among Medicare patients receiving chemotherapy and PP in US clinicalpractice, PP was administered before the recommended timing in 5% of cycles andFN incidence was significantly higher in these cycles. Along with prior research,study findings support recently updated US practice guidelines indicating that PPshould be administered the day after chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1080/03007995.2018.1495621 PMID: 29962268
