Hybrid gels created by the combination of C-1, C-2, andabove-mentioned dyes have been termed complex-luminogen mixed gels (CLMGs).Ensuing CLMGs have been thoroughly characterized by spectral, morphological, and rheological studies. Cytotoxicity measurements and imaging against breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 unveiled that three out of the five CLMGs can be effectivelyused for cell imaging. Interestingly, direct use of the metal-containing hybridgels for live cell imaging which is a distinctive approach, has been successfullyachieved with significantly encouraging results.DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b01837 PMCID: PMC6044964PMID: 30023918
