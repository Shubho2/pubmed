However, with current postsurgicalhistologic margin analysis, one quarter of breast cancer patients undergoreexcision to achieve negative margins corresponding to decreased localrecurrence and better outcomes. Therefore, a method with high resolution andspecificity for intraoperative margin assessment is needed.Experimental Design:First, quantitative immunofluorescence staining of B7-H3 expression was assessed in four pathologic stages of breast cancer progression of the MMTV-PyMTtransgenic murine model. Next, an antibody-dye contrast agent, B7-H3-ICG, wasinjected into mice prior to surgical resection of breast cancer. Anatomicultrasound, spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA), and fluorescence imaging were usedto guide resection of mammary glands suspected of containing cancer. Resectedtissues were processed for H&E staining and pathologic assessment and comparedwith sPA and fluorescence imaging signals.Results: Tissue containing DCIS (46.0 ±4.8 a.u.) or invasive carcinoma (91.7 ± 21.4 a.u.) showed significantly higher (P< 0.05) B7-H3 expression than normal and hyperplastic tissues (1.3 ± 0.8 a.u.).During image-guided surgical resection, tissue pieces assessed as normal orhyperplastic (n = 17) showed lower average sPA (3.17 ± 0.48 a.u.) andfluorescence signal [6.83E07 ± 2.00E06 (p/s)/(μW/cm²)] than DCIS and invasivecarcinoma tissue (n = 63) with an average sPA signal of 23.98 ± 4.88 a.u. and an average fluorescence signal of 7.56E07 ± 1.44E06 (p/s)/(μW/cm²) with AUCs of 0.93[95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87-0.99] and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.57-0.85),respectively.Conclusions: It was demonstrated that sPA and fluorescence molecularimaging combined with B7-H3-ICG agent can assess the disease status of tissueswith high diagnostic accuracy, intraoperatively, with high resolution,sensitivity, and specificity.
