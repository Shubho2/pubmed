End oflife expenditures were calculated as the sum of total Medicare expenditures forinpatient, outpatient, physician, home health, hospice, and skilled nursingfacility costs during the last 6 months of life.FINDINGS: For each type of cancer, total Medicare expenditures in the last 6months of life were lower for rural decedents compared to their urbancounterparts. During the last 6 months of life, median Medicare expenditures werelower for rural decedents for breast cancer ($21,839 vs $25,698), lung cancer($22,814 vs $27,635), and colorectal cancer ($24,156 vs $28,035; all differences significant at P < .05). In adjusted models, care for rural decedents was lesscostly than urban decedents for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer,respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that Medicare expenditures are lower for ruralbeneficiaries with each type of cancer than urban beneficiaries, even afteradjusting for age, gender, race, dual eligibility, region, chronic conditions,and type of service utilization. The findings from this study can be useful forpolicymakers in developing programs and resource allocation decisions that impactrural beneficiaries.Â© 2018 National Rural Health Association.DOI: 10.1111/jrh.12301 PMID: 29656565
