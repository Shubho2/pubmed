Older age (HR 1.44 [1.08-1.91], p = 0.01) and positive family history (HR 1.85 [1.47-2.32], p < 0.0001) were risk factors for contralateral BC. Significantprotective factors for IBTR were hormonotherapy (HR 0.71 [0.59-0.85], p =0.0003), chemotherapy (HR 0.72 [0.60-0.87], p = 0.001), and radiotherapy (HR 0.73[0.61-0.87], p = 0.0005). Hormonotherapy was also confirmed as a protectivefactor for contralateral second BC (HR 0.43 [0.30-0.60], p < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: We classified factors for IBTR and contralateral BC in high- andlow-risk groups. In the high-risk group, breast surgery still remains moreimportant than in the low-risk group, which seems to benefit more from adjuvanttreatments.Â© 2018 S.
