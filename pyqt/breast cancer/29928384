Tumor protein p53 regulates the expression of target genes in response tocellular stress. Additionally, p53 participates in the regulation of cell cyclecheckpoints, DNA repair and apoptosis. Mutations in the TP53 gene are associated with numerous types of human cancer, including breast cancer, sarcomas, braintumors and adrenal cortical carcinomas. In breast cancer, TP53 mutations are anegative prognostic factor. Tumors with TP53 mutations are more likely to beaggressive (triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer), and resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In addition to a well-known TP53 mutation, a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms have beensystematically identified and evaluated in human populations. In the presentarticle, the role of TP53 mutations and polymorphisms in clinical practice andbreast cancer treatment has been described. Additionally, the existing data onTP53 polymorphisms in breast cancer as prognostic and predictive factors havebeen summarized. A literature search of these topics was performed through PubMedand abstracts of the main cancer congresses in recent years.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8627 PMCID: PMC6006469PMID: 29928384
