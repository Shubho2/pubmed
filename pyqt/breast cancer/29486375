For better camouflageduring blood circulation, poly(ethylene glycol) was decorated on the surface ofMSN@GO nanohybrid.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The nanocarrier was characterized by using X-ray powderdiffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), UV-vis spectroscopy, thermalgravimetry analysis (TGA), FT-IR, SEM and TEM.RESULTS: The size of modified MSN@GO was around 75.8 nm and 24% wt. of curcuminwas loaded on the final nanohybrid. pHdecrement from 7.4 to 5.8 the releasemedium led to increase the cumulative amount of drug release from 54% to 98%.CONCLUSIONS: As-functionalized MSN@GO had no cytotoxicity against human breastadenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and human mammary epithelial (MCF10A) as cancerous andnormal cell lines, respectively. Whereas curcuminloaded nanohybrid showedexcellent killing capability against MCF-7 cells.Copyright © 2018 Medical University of Bialystok. Published by Elsevier B.V.
