There is a lack of data regarding the impact of reconstruction overpsychological traits and quality of life. The aim of this study is to evaluatepersonality changes in patients who underwent reconstructive surgery.METHODS: Thirty-seven women underwent breast reconstruction. These women took theCrown-Crisp Experiential Index before and after the different procedures. Thequestionnaire analyzes: (a) the satisfaction level with personal relationshipsbefore and after surgery, and the level of satisfaction with surgical results and(b) personality index. Comparisons of preoperative and postoperative personality traits were made by using the Crown-Crisp test and analyzed by Chi-square test.Correlations between preoperative concerns and CCEI traits and correlationsbetween physical aspects and Crown-Crisp, both preoperatively andpostoperatively, were performed using the Spearman test.RESULTS: We found statistically significant differences in the following traits: anxiety anticipating possible technique failures (p = 0.01); cancer recurrence(p = 0.04); dissatisfaction with results (p = 0.02); phobic anxiety for possible technique failure (p = 0.03); obsessionality with possible technique failure(p = 0.01); preoccupations around cancer recurrence (p = 0.01) anddissatisfaction with results (p = 0.03); somatic of technique failure (p = 0.05);and finally, depression and hysteria traits in response to surgical proceduresexcept anesthesia.CONCLUSION: This prospective study suggests that personality traits defineperceptions of body image, which has an influence over quality of life andsatisfaction with results.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level ofevidence to each article.
