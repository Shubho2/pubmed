Chan School of Public Health ,Boston , MA , USA.Laboratory studies indicate that melatonin has beneficial vascular effects.However, epidemiologic studies on the relationship between endogenous levels ofmelatonin and hypertension in humans are limited. We examined the association of quartile levels of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) in first morning urines withprevalent and incident hypertension in 777 postmenopausal women who wereoriginally part of a case-control study of breast cancer nested in the Women'sHealth Initiative Observational Study. A total of 321 prevalent and 172 incident cases of hypertension were studied. In cross-sectional analyses, higher quartile level of aMT6s was associated with lower odds of hypertension (Q4 versus Q1; oddsratio = 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3-0.9), after adjustment for age,body mass index and other risk factors. We also examined the association between baseline aMT6s levels and risk of incident hypertension. Compared to women in thelowest quartile of urinary aMT6s, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and95% CIs of incident hypertension for women in the second, third and highestquartile were 1.16 (0.8-1.8), 0.96 (0.6-1.5) and 1.02 (0.6-1.6), respectively.The mean change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure over 3 years also didnot vary by baseline quartile levels of aMT6s. Although we found no evidence of aprospective association between urinary levels of aMT6s and risk of incidenthypertension in postmenopausal women, our cross-sectional results provide somepossible evidence of a role for physiologic levels of melatonin in hypertension. Additional larger studies are warranted, preferably with a wider range of ages,both genders and multiple melatonin measurements.DOI: 10.1080/07420528.2018.1461109 PMID: 29750588
