We present here in vitro liquid extractionsurface analysis mass spectrometry (ivLESA-MS), a variation on LESA-MS, performeddirectly on adherent cells grown in 96-well cell culture plates. To accomplishthis, culture medium was aspirated immediately prior to analysis, and metaboliteswere extracted using LESA from the cell monolayer surface, followed bynano-electrospray ionization and MS analysis in negative ion mode. We appliedthis platform to characterize and compare lipidomic profiles of multiple breastcancer cell lines growing in culture (MCF-7, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-231)and revealed distinct and reproducible lipidomic signatures between the celllines. Additionally, we demonstrated time-dependent processing artifacts,underscoring the importance of immediate analysis. ivLESA-MS represents a rapidin vitro metabolomic method, which precludes the need for quenching, cellharvesting, sample preparation, and chromatography, significantly shorteningpreparation and analysis time while minimizing processing artifacts. This method could be further adapted to test drugs in vitro in a high throughput manner.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00530 PMID: 29608279
