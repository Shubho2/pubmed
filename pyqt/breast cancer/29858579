[Epub ahead of print]Macrodissection prior to closed system RT-qPCR is not necessary for estrogenreceptor and HER2 concordance with IHC/FISH in breast cancer.Gupta S(1), Mani NR(1), Carvajal-Hausdorf DE(1)(2), Bossuyt V(1), Ho K(3),Weidler J(4), Wong W(3), Rhees B(3), Bates M(4), Rimm DL(5).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT,USA.(2)Anatomía Patológica, Clínica Alemana-Facultad de Medicina Universidad delDesarrollo, Santiago, Chile.(3)Division of Oncology Research and Development, Oncology, Cepheid, Sunnyvale,CA, USA.(4)Medical and Scientific Affairs and Strategy, Oncology, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA,USA.(5)Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT,USA. david.rimm@yale.edu.An on-demand, closed RT-qPCR, the GeneXpert (GX) system, has the potential toprovide biomarker information in low-resourced settings and elsewhere. We usedthis system with a research use only version of the Breast Cancer STRAT4cartridge that measures the mRNA expression levels of ERBB2, ESR1, PGR, andMKi67. Here we evaluated the impact of non-macrodissected (non m-d) versusmacrodissected (m-d) samples using STRAT4 on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded(FFPE) core needle biopsies. Two cohorts were assessed: (1) 60 FFPE infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDCA) cases and (2) 20 FFPE IDCA cases with ductal carcinoma insitu (DCIS) with a range of HER2 expression as determined by clinicalimmunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (IHC/FISH). Weobserved about half of the core needle biopsy area as invasive tumor in both IDCA(mean = 51.5%) and IDCA with DCIS (mean = 53.5%) cohorts, but also found the mRNAlevels were independent of tumor area. We found excellent agreement of the mRNAtranscript level between the paired samples, m-d versus non m-d, for ERBB2, ESR1,PGR, and MKi67 for both the IDCA and IDCA with DCIS cohorts. No significantdifference (P > 0.99) was observed when we compared the mRNA transcript levelbetween the paired samples m-d versus non m-d. In addition, we noted asignificant concordance (P < 0.001) between RT-qPCR and IHC/FISH forHER2-positivity, ER-positivity, and PR-positivity, independent of specimendissection. These data suggest that mRNA expression for ERBB2, ESR, and PGR issufficiently low in surrounding tissue cells such that macrodissection is notrequired for assessment of key breast cancer mRNA markers and is independent ofthe amount of input tumor. This approach may be valuable in settings lackingpathology expertise or using specimen types, such as fine-needle aspirates, whereit may be challenging to separate non-tumor from tumor tissue.DOI: 10.1038/s41374-018-0064-1 PMID: 29858579
