It was first developed to overcome thelimitation of operator dependency and lack of standardization and reproducibilityof handheld ultrasound. ABUS provides a three-dimensional representation ofbreast tissue and allows images reformatting in three planes, and the generatedcoronal plane has been suggested to improve diagnostic accuracy. This techniquehas been first used in the screening setting to improve breast cancer detection, especially in mammographically dense breasts. In recent years, numerous studiesalso evaluated its use in the diagnostic setting: they showed its suitability forbreast cancer staging, evaluation of tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and second-look ultrasound after magnetic resonance imaging. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the current body of literatureabout the clinical performance of ABUS, summarize available evidence, andidentify gaps in knowledge for future research.Copyright Â© 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.
