One mechanism of interest known as concomitant tumour resistance (CTR) can be definedas the inhibition of metastasis by existing tumour mass. Conversely, the presenceof a primary tumour has also been shown to increase metastatic outgrowth, termed concomitant tumour enhancement (CTE). The majority of studies evaluating CTR/CTE in preclinical models have relied on endpoint histological evaluation of tumourburden. The goal of this research was to use conventional magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI), cellular MRI, and bioluminescence imaging to study the impact of aprimary tumour on the development of brain metastases in a syngeneic mouse model.Here, we report that the presence of a 4T1 primary tumour significantly enhances total brain tumour burden in Balb/C mice. Using in vivo BLI/MRI we coulddetermine this was not related to differences in initial arrest or clearance ofviable cells in the brain, which suggests that the presence of a primary tumourcan increase the proliferative growth of brain metastases in this model. Thecontinued application of our longitudinal cellular and molecular imaging toolswill yield a better understanding of the mechanism(s) by which this physiologicalinhibition (CTR) and/or enhancement (CTE) occurs.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27208-4 PMCID: PMC5997674PMID: 29895974
