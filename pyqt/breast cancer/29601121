Srcinhibitors have been developed recently and have shown efficacy in breast cancer as a single agent or in combination with anti-HER2 antibodies or chemotherapy.Unfortunately, the potency of Src inhibitor is limited by the development of drugresistance. In our study, we established an Src inhibitor saracatinib-resistantbreast cancer cell line (SKBR-3/SI) for the first time and by evaluating mRNAexpression profile, we found that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) wasupregulated in saracatinib-resistant cells compared to the parent cells. Further study demonstrated that PAI-1 might induce saracatinib resistance in breastcancer cells by increasing the secretion of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5(CCL5). Functional assays showed that PAI-1 and CCL5 overexpression promoted cellproliferation and migration in breast cancer cells, while inhibition of PAI-1 andCCL5 decreased cell proliferation and migration in saracatinib-resistant cells.We also showed that targeting PAI-1 or CCL5 could reverse saracatinib resistance,which deserves more attention in clinical settings.Â© 2018 The Authors.
