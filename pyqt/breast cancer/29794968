This review stresses the limited success of traditional therapies as well as the use of nanomedicine for treating MBC. Understanding the biologicalbarriers of MBC that nanoparticle in vivo trafficking must overcome could providevaluable new insights for translating nanomedicine from the bench side to thebedside. A view about nanomedicine applied in BC therapy has been summarized withtheir present status, which is gaining attention in the clinically-appliedlandscape. The progressions of drug/gene delivery systems, especially the status of their preclinical or clinical trials, are also discussed. Here we highlightthat the treatment of metastasis, in addition to the extensively describedinhibition of primary tumor growth, is an indispensable requirement fornanomedicine. Along with more innovations in material chemistry and moreprogressions in biology, nanomedicine will constantly supply more exciting newapproaches for targeted drug/gene delivery against MBC.DOI: 10.3390/nano8060361 PMCID: PMC6027372PMID: 29794968
