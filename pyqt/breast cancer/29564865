Wedescribe the design and characterization of (i) a preclinical system for wholeanimal in vivo imaging and (ii) an integrated optical coherencetomography/confocal microscopy system for high-resolution imaging of ex vivotissues. We demonstrate these systems by administering erbium-dopednanocomposites to a murine model of metastatic breast cancer. Short-wave infraredemissions were detected in vivo and in whole organ imaging ex vivo. Visibleupconversion emissions and tissue autofluorescence were imaged in biopsyspecimens, alongside optical coherence tomography imaging of tissuemicrostructure. We anticipate that this work will provide guidance forresearchers seeking to image these nanomaterials across a wide range ofbiological models.(2018) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).DOI: 10.1117/1.JBO.23.3.030505 PMCID: PMC5862142 [Available on 2019-03-21]PMID: 29564865
