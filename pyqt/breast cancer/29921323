The purpose ofthis study was to perform a multicenter analysis to determine relationshipsbetween ADC and expression of Ki-67 and tumor grade in BC.METHODS: For this study, data from six centers were acquired. The samplecomprises 870 patients (all female; mean age, 52.6 ± 10.8 years). In every case, breast magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging was performed. The comparison of ADC values in groups was performed by Mann-Whitney U test wherethe p values are adjusted for multiple testing (Bonferroni correction). Theassociation between ADC and Ki-67 values was calculated by Spearman's rankcorrelation coefficient. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positivepredictive values, accuracy, and AUC were calculated for the diagnosticprocedures. ADC thresholds were chosen to maximize the Youden index.RESULTS: Overall, data of 870 patients were acquired for this study. The mean ADCvalue of the tumors was 0.98 ± 0.22 × 10- 3 mm2 s- 1. ROC analysis showed that itis impossible to differentiate high/moderate grade tumors from grade 1 lesionsusing ADC values. Youden index identified a threshold ADC value of 1.03 with asensitivity of 56.2% and specificity of 67.9%. The positive predictive value was 18.2%, and the negative predictive value was 92.4%. The level of the Ki-67proliferation index was available for 845 patients. The mean value was12.33 ± 21.77%. ADC correlated with weak statistical significant with expression of Ki-67 (p = - 0.202, p < 0.001). ROC analysis was performed to distinguishtumors with high proliferative potential from tumors with low expression of Ki-67using ADC values. Youden index identified a threshold ADC value of 0.91(sensitivity 64%, specificity 50%, positive predictive value 67.7%, negativepredictive value 45.0%).CONCLUSIONS: ADC cannot be used as a surrogate marker for proliferation activity and/or for tumor grade in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0991-1 PMCID: PMC6011203PMID: 29921323
