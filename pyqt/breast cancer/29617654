In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RB1 and PTEN arefrequently inactivated together with TP53. We performedkinome/phosphatase inhibitor screens on primary mouse Rb/p53-, Pten/p53-, andhuman RB1/PTEN/TP53-deficient TNBC cell lines and identified CDC25 phosphatase asa common target. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of CDC25 suppressed growthof RB1-deficient TNBC cells that are resistant to combined CDK4/6 plus CDK2inhibition. Minimal cooperation was observed in vitro between CDC25 antagonistsand CDK1, CDK2, or CDK4/6 inhibitors, but strong synergy with WEE1 inhibition wasapparent. In accordance with increased PI3K signaling following long-term CDC25inhibition, CDC25 and PI3K inhibitors effectively synergized to suppress TNBCgrowth both in vitro and in xenotransplantation models. These results provide arationale for the development of CDC25-based therapies for diverseRB1/PTEN/TP53-deficient and -proficient TNBCs.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.
