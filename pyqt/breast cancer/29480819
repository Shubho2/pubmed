Genome-wide comparisons of both theDNA and gene expression of primary tumors and metastases in multiple patientscould help elucidate the underlying mechanisms that cause breast cancermetastasis. To address this issue, we performed DNA exome and RNA sequencing ofmatched primary tumors and multiple metastases from 16 patients, totaling 83distinct specimens. We identified tumor-specific drivers by integrating knownprotein-protein network information with RNA expression and somatic DNAalterations and found that genetic drivers were predominantly established in the primary tumor and maintained through metastatic spreading. In addition, ouranalyses revealed that most genetic drivers were DNA copy number changes, theTP53 mutation was a recurrent founding mutation regardless of subtype, and thatmulticlonal seeding of metastases was frequent and occurred in multiple subtypes.Genetic drivers unique to metastasis were identified as somatic mutations in the estrogen and androgen receptor genes. These results highlight the complexity ofmetastatic spreading, be it monoclonal or multiclonal, and suggest that mostmetastatic drivers are established in the primary tumor, despite the substantial heterogeneity seen in the metastases.DOI: 10.1172/JCI96153 PMCID: PMC5873890PMID: 29480819
