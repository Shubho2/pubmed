Partridge, Dana-FarberCancer Institute, Boston, MA.Purpose The role of temporary ovarian suppression with gonadotropin-releasinghormone agonists (GnRHa) during chemotherapy as a strategy to preserve ovarianfunction and fertility in premenopausal women remains controversial. Thissystematic review and meta-analysis using individual patient-level data wasconducted to better assess the efficacy and safety of this strategy in patientswith early breast cancer. Methods The trials in which premenopausal women withearly breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy alone or with concurrent GnRHa were eligible for inclusion. Primary end pointswere premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) rate and post-treatment pregnancyrate. Disease-free survival and overall survival were secondary end points.Because each study represents a cluster, statistical analyses were performedusing a random effects model. Results A total of 873 patients from five trialswere included. POI rate was 14.1% in the GnRHa group and 30.9% in the controlgroup (adjusted odds ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.57; P < .001). A total of 37 (10.3%) patients had at least one post-treatment pregnancy in the GnRHa group and20 (5.5%) in the control group (incidence rate ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.06 to 3.15;P = .030). No significant differences in disease-free survival (adjusted hazardratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.42; P = .999) and overall survival (adjustedhazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.06; P = .083) were observed between groups.Conclusion Our findings provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of temporaryovarian suppression with GnRHa during chemotherapy as an available option toreduce the likelihood of chemotherapy-induced POI and potentially improve future fertility in premenopausal patients with early breast cancer.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2018.78.0858 PMID: 29718793
