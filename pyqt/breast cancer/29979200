Potential BRCA germline mutation carriers may be missedfollowing the current eligibility criteria for BRCA genetic testing. The purpose of this study was to, therefore, develop an immunohistochemistry-based model topredict likelihood of underlying BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in unselectedfemale breast cancer patients. The study group consisted of 100 BRCA1-related, 46BRCA2-related, and 94 sporadic breast carcinomas. Tumor expression of 44 proteinsinvolved in (BRCA-related) breast carcinogenesis was assessed byimmunohistochemistry. A prediction model for BRCA-related versus non-BRCA-relatedbreast cancer was developed using Lasso logistic regression analysis withcross-validation. The model was assessed for its discriminative value andclinical usefulness. The optimal prediction model included 14 predictors (age,cyclinD1, ERα, ERβ, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, GLUT1, IGFR, Ki67, mitotic activityindex, MLH1, p120, and TOP2A), showed excellent discriminative performance (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve=0.943; 95% confidenceinterval=0.909-0.978), and reasonable calibration. To enhance possibleimplementation, we developed an alternative model only considering more widelyavailable immunostains. This model included 15 predictors (age, BCL2, CK5/6,CK8/18, cyclinD1, E-cadherin, ERα, HER2, Ki67, mitotic activity index , MLH1,p16, PMS2, PR, and vimentin), and still showed very good discriminativeperformance (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve=0.853; 95%confidence interval=0.795-0.911). We present a well-applicable and accurate tool to predict which breast cancer patients may have an underlying BRCA germlinemutation, largely consisting of immunohistochemical markers independent ofclinical characteristics. This may improve identification of potential BRCAgermline mutation carriers and optimize referral for germline mutation testing.DOI: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000001115 PMID: 29979200
