Theprimary endpoint was the percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to 12months. Patient subgroups were analyzed according to baseline variables that are known risk factors for bone loss, including previous AI therapy, age, time since menopause, baseline body mass index (BMI), and baseline BMD T-score.Results: At 12 months, lumbar spine BMD increased by 4.7%; the patients who were administered AI therapy prior to denosumab (n=70) demonstrated a 4.7% increase inBMD, and the patients who received denosumab at the start of AI therapy (n=30)demonstrated a 4.5% increase in BMD (p=0.8385). Additionally, 2.4% and 1.4%increases in BMD of the right and left femoral neck, respectively, were observed.Initiation of AI (with denosumab, before denosumab), type of AI (non-steroidal,steroidal), age (<65, ≥65 years), time since menopause (≤5, >5 years), BMI (<25, ≥25 kg/m2), and T-score (≤-1.0, >-1.0) of the right femoral neck were as follows:(2.2%, 2.5%, p=0.7773), (2.6%, 0.9%, p=0.1726), (2.5%, 2.3%, p=0.7594), (2.1%,2.4%, p=0.2034), (2.1%, 2.9%, p=0.2034), and (2.3%, 2.7%, p=0.6823),respectively. Initiation of AI (with denosumab, before denosumab), type of AI(non-steroidal, steroidal), age (<65, ≥65 years), time since menopause (≤5, >5years), BMI (<25, ≥25 kg/m2), and T-score (≤-1.0, >-1.0) of the left femoral neckwere as follows: (1.0%, 1.5%, p=0.1972), (1.2%, 2.7%, p=0.2931), (1.4%, 1.3%,p=0.8817), (-0.1%, 1.6%, p=0.1766), (1.3%, 1.9%, p=0.6465), and (1.5%, 1.1%,p=0.6573), respectively.Conclusion: Twice-yearly treatment with denosumab was associated with increasedBMD among Japanese women receiving adjuvant AI therapy, regardless of thebaseline characteristics or skeletal site.DOI: 10.2147/TCRM.S167579 PMCID: PMC6044343PMID: 30022834
