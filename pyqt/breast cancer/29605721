Electronic address:xguan@nju.edu.cn.Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breastcancer that poses a clinical challenge. Thus, new therapy strategies are urgentlyneeded. The selective WEE1 inhibitor, AZD1775, has shown stronganti-proliferative effects on a variety of tumors. Here, we first demonstratethat inhibition of ATR by selective inhibitor AZD6738 can enhance AZD1775-caused growth inhibition in TNBC. Our results show that the enhanced cell death isattributed to repressed DNA damage repair and excessive replication stress,thereby causing increased DNA damage reflected by accumulation of the DNAdouble-strand-break marker γH2AX. On the other hand, combined treatment withAZD6738 and AZD1775 forces mitotic entry of cells with DNA damages by activating CDK1 activity, inducing severely aberrant mitosis and mitotic catastrophe,ultimately resulting in cell death. Dual inhibition of WEE1 and ATR alsoinactivated RAD51-mediated homologous recombination, which sensitized TNBC cells to cisplatin and PARP inhibitor. Here, based on the preclinical results that ATR inhibition synergizes with WEE1 inhibition in TNBC, we propose that thiscombination therapy alone, or in parallel with chemotherapy, represents aninnovative and potent targeted therapy in TNBC.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.
