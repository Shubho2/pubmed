Dietary intakes werecollected using repeated 24 hour dietary records, designed to registerparticipants' usual consumption for 3300 different food items. These werecategorised according to their degree of processing by the NOVA classification.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations between ultra-processed food intake and risk of overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer assessed by multivariable Coxproportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors.RESULTS: Ultra-processed food intake was associated with higher overall cancerrisk (n=2228 cases; hazard ratio for a 10% increment in the proportion ofultra-processed food in the diet 1.12 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.18); Pfor trend<0.001) and breast cancer risk (n=739 cases; hazard ratio 1.11 (1.02 to 1.22); P for trend=0.02). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for several markers of the nutritional quality of the diet (lipid,sodium, and carbohydrate intakes and/or a Western pattern derived by principalcomponent analysis).CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, a 10% increase in the proportion ofultra-processed foods in the diet was associated with a significant increase ofgreater than 10% in risks of overall and breast cancer. Further studies areneeded to better understand the relative effect of the various dimensions ofprocessing (nutritional composition, food additives, contact materials, andneoformed contaminants) in these associations.STUDY REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03335644.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.
