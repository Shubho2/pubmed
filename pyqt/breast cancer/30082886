Despite recent progress, the role of WWOX indriving breast carcinogenesis remains unknown. Here we report that ablation ofWwox in mammary tumor-susceptible mice results in increased tumorigenesis, andthat the resultant tumors resemble human BLBC. Interestingly, copy number loss ofTrp53 and downregulation of its transcript levels were observed in the Wwoxknockout tumors. Moreover, tumors isolated from Wwox and Trp53 mutant mice wereindistinguishable histologically and transcriptionally. Finally, we find thatdeletion of TP53 and WWOX co-occurred and is associated with poor survival ofbreast cancer patients. Altogether, our data uncover an essential role for WWOXas a bona fide breast cancer tumor suppressor through the maintenance of p53stability.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0896-z PMCID: PMC6079009PMID: 30082886
