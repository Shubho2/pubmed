Using an albumin-indocyanine green dual-modalnanoprobe developed in our laboratory, in vivo fluorescence imaging andphotoacoustic imaging of metastatic breast cancer tumors were performedseparately. Fluorescence imaging at the near-infrared window features highimaging sensitivity but is generally limited by a low imaging depth. Thus, tumorscan only be observed in situ whereas tumor cells in the lymph nodes and lungcannot be imaged in a precise manner. In contrast, photoacoustic imaging oftenhelps overcome the limitations of imaging depth with high acoustic spatialresolution, which could provide complementary information for imaging cancermetastases. Ex vivo fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging were also performed toverify the tumor metastatic route. This study may not only provide insights into the design of dual-modal nanoprobes for breast cancer diagnosis but may alsodemonstrate the superiority of combined fluorescence imaging and photoacousticimaging for guiding, monitoring, and evaluating lymphatic and lung metastaticstages of breast cancer with a high imaging specificity as well as sensitivity.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b09142 PMID: 30044603
