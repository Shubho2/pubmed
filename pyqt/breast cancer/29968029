To evaluate differences in adjuvant therapy receiptand overall survival (OS), we compared clinically node-negative (cN0) elderlypatients who did and did not undergo axillary surgery.METHODS: Patients aged ≥70 years in the National Cancer Database (2004-2014) withcT1-3, cN0 breast cancer were divided into two cohorts-those with surgical LNevaluation (one or more nodes removed) and those without (no nodes removed).Propensity scores were used to match patients based on age, year of diagnosis,tumor grade, cT stage, estrogen receptor status, and Charlson-Deyo comorbidityscore. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the effect of LNsurgery on OS.RESULTS: Overall, 133,778 patients were matched, of whom 102,247 patients (76.4%)underwent nodal surgery. Patients undergoing nodal surgery were more likely toreceive chemotherapy (pN1-3: 22.2%; pN0: 5.8%; cN0-no nodal surgery: 2.8%;p < 0.001), radiation (pN1-3: 49.7%; pN0: 47.5%; cN0-no nodal surgery: 26%;p < 0.001), and endocrine therapy (pN1-3: 72%; pN0: 58.5%; cN0-no nodal surgery: 46.5%; p < 0.001). After adjustment for known covariates, patients who did notundergo nodal surgery had a worse OS (hazard ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.61-1.70).CONCLUSIONS: For elderly cN0 breast cancer patients, axillary surgery wasassociated with higher rates of adjuvant therapy and improved OS. A selectiveapproach to omitting nodal surgery should be considered in elderly patients with cN0 breast cancer as axillary staging may influence subsequent treatmentdecisions and long-term outcomes.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6595-2 PMID: 29968029
