The aim of this study was to investigate theinfluence of physico-chemical properties of chemotherapeutic agents in theirloading, release behavior, and skin permeation using microneedles. Zeinmicroneedles were fabricated using the micromolding technique containing 36microneedles in a 1-cm2 area. These microneedles were loaded with two anti-breastcancer drugs, tamoxifen and gemcitabine, having different water solubilities.Entrapment or surface coating of chemotherapeutic agents in zein microneedles wasoptimized to achieve greater loading efficiency. The greatest loading achievedwas 607 ± 21 and 1459 ± 74 μg for tamoxifen and gemcitabine using the entrapment approach, respectively. Skin permeation studies in excised porcine skin showedthat the coating on microneedles approach results in greater skin deposition for tamoxifen; while the poke-and-patch approach would provide greater skinpermeation for gemcitabine. Taken together, it can be concluded that differentloading strategies and skin penetration approaches have to be studied fordelivery of small molecules using polymeric microneedles.DOI: 10.1208/s12249-018-1004-5 PMID: 29616489
