Weused big data comprising 800 patients who underwent breast-conserving therapy forevaluation. The CTV were validated by experienced radiation oncologists. Weperformed a fivefold cross-validation to test the performance of the model. Thesegmentation accuracy was quantified by the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) andthe Hausdorff distance (HD). The performance of the proposed model was evaluated against two different deep learning models: deep dilated convolutional neuralnetwork (DDCNN) and deep deconvolutional neural network (DDNN).RESULTS: Mean DSC values of DD-ResNet (0.91 and 0.91) were higher than the other two networks (DDCNN: 0.85 and 0.85; DDNN: 0.88 and 0.87) for both right-sided andleft-sided BC. It also has smaller mean HD values of 10.5 mm and 10.7 mm comparedwith DDCNN (15.1 mm and 15.6 mm) and DDNN (13.5 mm and 14.1 mm). Meansegmentation time was 4 s, 21 s and 15 s per patient with DDCNN, DDNN andDD-ResNet, respectively. The DD-ResNet was also superior with regard to resultsin the literature.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method could segment the CTV accurately with acceptabletime consumption. It was invariant to the body size and shape of patients andcould improve the consistency of target delineation and streamline radiotherapyworkflows.Copyright © 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.
