Whetherbariatric surgery influences the risk of obesity-related cancer is not clear.This study aimed to uncover the risk of hormone-related (breast, endometrial and prostate), colorectal and oesophageal cancers following obesity surgery.METHODS: This national population-based cohort study used data from the Hospital Episode Statistics database in England collected between 1997 and 2012.Propensity matching on sex, age, co-morbidity and duration of follow-up was used to compare cancer risk among obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery(gastric bypass, gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy) and obese individuals notundergoing such surgery. Conditional logistic regression provided odds ratios(ORs) with 95 per cent confidence intervals.RESULTS: In the study period, from a cohort of 716 960 patients diagnosed withobesity, 8794 patients who underwent bariatric surgery were matched exactly with 8794 obese patients who did not have surgery. Compared with the no-surgery group,patients who had bariatric surgery exhibited a decreased risk of hormone-related cancers (OR 0·23, 95 per cent c.i. 0·18 to 0·30). This decrease was consistentfor breast (OR 0·25, 0·19 to 0·33), endometrium (OR 0·21, 0·13 to 0·35) andprostate (OR 0·37, 0·17 to 0·76) cancer. Gastric bypass resulted in the largestrisk reduction for hormone-related cancers (OR 0·16, 0·11 to 0·24). Gastricbypass, but not gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy, was associated with anincreased risk of colorectal cancer (OR 2·63, 1·17 to 5·95). Longer follow-upafter bariatric surgery strengthened these diverging associations.CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery is associated with decreased risk ofhormone-related cancers, whereas gastric bypass might increase the risk ofcolorectal cancer.© 2018 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/bjs.10914 PMID: 30003539
