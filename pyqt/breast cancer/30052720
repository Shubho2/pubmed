[Epub ahead of print]Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Breast Cancer: Evaluating InterobserverVariability, Heterogeneity, and Fidelity of Scoring Core Biopsies.Khoury T(1), Peng X(2), Yan L(2), Wang D(2), Nagrale V(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.(2)Department of Biostatistics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.Objectives: The aims were to evaluate breast cancer (BC) tumor-infiltratinglymphocytes (TILs) interobserver variability, heterogeneity, and the fidelity of scoring TILs in core needle biopsy (CNB).Methods: Matching CNB and two full-face sections (FFSs) of BC cases (n = 100)were independently reviewed by two pathologists. Percentage of stromallymphocytes (TIL-str) and intratumoral lymphocytes (iTu-Ly) were recorded.Results: The weighted Îº values for the degree of agreement between both raterswere 0.53 to 0.71. However, there was a slight improvement in the interobservervariability for TIL-str and slight decline in iTu-Ly when ER+/HER2- cases wereexcluded. The intraclass correlation coefficient for FFS1 vs FFS2 was 0.91 forTIL-str and 0.96 for iTu-Ly. Spearman correlation coefficient for CNB vsFFS1/FFS2 was 0.81 for TIL-str and 0.79 for iTu-Ly.Conclusions: We conclude that the agreement in TILs scoring between the raters isacceptable. Caution should be practiced when scoring iTu-Ly in CNBs.DOI: 10.1093/ajcp/aqy069 PMID: 30052720
