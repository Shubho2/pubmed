Theobjective of this study was to validate the relationship between paclitaxelexposure and peripheral neuropathy.Experimental Design: Patients with breastcancer receiving paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 × 12 weekly doses were enrolled in anobservational clinical study (NCT02338115). Paclitaxel plasma concentration wasmeasured at the end of and 16-26 hours after the first infusion to estimate Cmax and Tc>0.05 Patient-reported peripheral neuropathy was collected via CIPN20 ateach dose, and an 8-item sensory subscale (CIPN8) was used in the primaryanalysis to test for an association with Tc>0.05 Secondary analyses wereconducted using Cmax as an alternative exposure parameter and testing eachparameter with a secondary endpoint of the occurrence of peripheralneuropathy-induced treatment disruption.Results: In 60 subjects included in theanalysis, the increase in CIPN8 during treatment was associated with baselineCIPN8, cumulative dose, and relative dose intensity (P < 0.05), but neitherTc>0.05 (P = 0.27) nor Cmax (P = 0.99). In analyses of the secondary endpoint,cumulative dose (OR = 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-1.80; P = 0.0008) and Tc>0.05 (OR = 1.79; 95% CI, 1.06-3.01; P = 0.029) or Cmax (OR = 2.74; 95% CI,1.45-5.20; P = 0.002) were associated with peripheral neuropathy-inducedtreatment disruption.Conclusions: Paclitaxel exposure is predictive of theoccurrence of treatment-limiting peripheral neuropathy in patients receivingweekly paclitaxel for breast cancer. Studies are warranted to determine whetherexposure-guided dosing enhances treatment effectiveness and/or preventsperipheral neuropathy in these patients.
