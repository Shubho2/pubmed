RAhas been reported to be an effective treatment for allergy, diabetes, thrombosis,liver steatosis, lung fibrosis and colitis. In addition, RA effectively inhibits tumor growth and induces apoptosis; however, the effects of RA, at non-cytotoxic doses, on the metastasis and angiogenesis of malignant cancer cells have, to bethe best of our knowledge, not been identified. In the present study, it wasidentified that RA suppressed the metastatic potential of MDA‑MB231 breast cancercells, including colony formation, migration and invasion. Human umbilical veinendothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with RA exhibited a decreased ability to form tube-like networks and to migrate across a Transwell membrane, when compared withRA‑untreated HUVECs. Using the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, RA treatmentsignificantly suppressed spontaneous and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)-induced angiogenesis. Furthermore, RA inhibited the production ofpro-angiogenic factors, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, pentraxin‑3, interleukin-8, VEGF and placental growth factor under normoxic and hypoxicconditions, and suppressed the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced increasein the gelatinolytic MMP‑9 activity and MMP‑9 expression in HT1080 cells. RA alsosignificantly inhibited the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α pathway, leading todecreased HIF‑1α accumulation and HIF‑1α nuclear expression under hypoxia. These results indicated that RA exhibits potent anti‑metastatic and anti‑angiogenicactivities with no cytotoxicity via suppression of the HIF‑1α signaling pathway. Thus, RA may control malignant cancer cells by inhibiting the spread from primarytumors and expansion to distant organs.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4479 PMCID: PMC6065401PMID: 30015877
