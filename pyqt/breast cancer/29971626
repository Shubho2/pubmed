Of those who did initiate ET, 42% were non-adherent with a median ET usageduration of 37 months. Twenty-one percent of initiators continued taking ET for 5years or more. There was no change in the odds of ET non-initiation from 2000 to 2004 (OR 1.02, p = 0.67). The odds of ET non-initiation decreased from 2005 to2009 (OR 0.81, p < 0.001) but then increased from 2010 to 2014 (OR 1.08,p = 0.002). There was no change in the odds of ET non-adherence from 2000 to 2006(OR 1.02, p = 0.53), but from 2007 to 2012, the odds of ET non-adherencedecreased each year (OR 0.93, p = 0.02). The average ET usage duration wasincreasing from 2000 to 2006 (β = 2.74, p < 0.001) but decreasing from 2006 to2012 (β = - 1.46, p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a realistic picture of the challenges associatedwith ET usage among South Carolina Medicaid breast cancer patients. Itparticularly highlights small improvements over time in ET usage rates,indicating more opportunities for improvement in ET initiation, adherence, andduration among younger women of lower socio-economic status.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4866-z PMID: 29971626
