Suturing techniques should decrease scar tissue formation and provide good cosmetic results. The use of an accordion suturing technique mayresult in decreased surgical wound lengths and better cosmetic outcomes. Wecompared the outcomes of the accordion suturing technique with the standardsuturing technique in breast cancer surgeries.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female patients undergoing wide local excision of breastcancers were randomised to undergo closure of their surgical wound by either the accordion or the non-accordion (standard) suturing techniques between the months of May and October 2015. Pre-closure and post-closure wound lengths were measuredintra-operatively. The primary outcome was a reduction of the surgical woundlength at 6 weeks. The secondary outcome was a composite of the absence ofhypertrophic scar tissue formation and optimal cosmesis.RESULTS: Thirty eligible women for wide local excision of breast tumours wererandomly assigned to the accordion and non-accordion groups (15 accordion and 15 non-accordion). Seven women were excluded from the study because they underwentre-excision of margins for their breast tumours before the end of 6 weeks, andone woman was lost to follow-up. We therefore compared the outcomes of 12 womenwho underwent closure of their surgical wound by way of the accordion suturingtechnique to the outcomes of 10 women who underwent closure with thenon-accordion (standard) suturing technique. The percentage reduction of woundlength at 6 weeks was significantly greater in the accordion group than in thenon-accordion group (M = 24.4, SD = 10.2 vs. M = 8.6, SD = 11.5, p = 0.0026).There was no significant difference in the cosmetic outcome between both groupsusing the James Quinn's wound evaluation score.CONCLUSION: The accordion suturing technique was associated with a significantreduction in surgical wound lengths in breast conserving surgery at 6 weekswithout compromising the cosmetic result.DOI: 10.1007/s11845-018-1772-7 PMID: 29564720
