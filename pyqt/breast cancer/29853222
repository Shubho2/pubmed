Electronic address: jttj571@sina.com.The objective of our study was to assess, in a reader study, radiologists'performance in interpretation of automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) imageswith the aid of a computer-aided detection (CADe) system. Our study is aretrospective observer study with the purpose of investigating the effectiveness of using a CADe system as an aid for radiologists in interpretation of ABVSimages. The multiple-reader, multiple-case study was designed to compare thediagnostic performance of radiologists with and without CADe. The study included 1000 cases selected from ABVS examinations in our institution in 2012. Amongthose cases were 206 malignant, 486 benign and 308 normal cases. The cancer caseswere consecutive; the benign and normal cases were randomly selected. Allmalignant and benign cases were confirmed by biopsy or surgery, and normal cases were confirmed by 2-y follow-up. Reader performance was compared in terms of areaunder the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity and specificity.Additionally, the reading time per case for each reader was recorded. Nineradiologists from our institution participated in the study. Three had more than 8 y of ultrasound experience and more than 4 y of ABVS experience (group A); 3had more than 5 y of ultrasound experience (group B), and 3 had more than 1 y of ultrasound experience (group C). Both group B and group C had no ABVS experience.The CADe system used was the QVCAD System (QView Medical, Inc., Los Altos, CA,USA). It is designed to aid radiologists in searching for suspicious areas inABVS images. CADe results are presented to the reader simultaneously with theABVS images; that is, the radiologists read the ABVS images concurrently with theCADe results. The cases were randomly assigned for each reader into twoequal-size groups, 1 and 2. Initially the readers read their group 1 cases withthe aid of CADe and their group 2 cases without CADe. After a 1-mo washoutperiod, they re-read their group 1 cases without CADe and their group 2 caseswith CADe. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of allreaders were 0.784 for reading with CADe and 0.747 without CADe. Areas under the curves with and without CADe were 0.833 and 0.829 for group A, 0.757 and 0.696for group B and 0.759 and 0.718 for group C. All differences in areas under thecurve were statistically significant (p <0.05), except that for group A. Theaverage reading time was 9.3% (p < < 0.05) faster with CADe for all readers. Insummary, CADe improves radiologist performance with respect to both accuracy and reading time for the detection of breast cancer using the ABVS, with the greater benefit for those inexperienced with ABVS.Copyright © 2018 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology.Published by Elsevier Inc.
