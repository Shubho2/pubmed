Methods Based on the signalsapproach, an Expert Panel reviewed published literature and research surveyresults on the observed frequency of less common in situ hybridization (ISH)patterns to update the recommendations. Recommendations Two recommendationsaddressed via correspondence in 2015 are included. First, immunohistochemistry(IHC) 2+ is defined as invasive breast cancer with weak to moderate completemembrane staining observed in > 10% of tumor cells. Second, if the initial HER2test result in a core needle biopsy specimen of a primary breast cancer isnegative, a new HER2 test may (not "must") be ordered on the excision specimenbased on specific clinical criteria. The HER2 testing algorithm for breast canceris updated to address the recommended work-up for less common clinical scenarios (approximately 5% of cases) observed when using a dual-probe ISH assay. Thesescenarios are described as ISH group 2 ( HER2/chromosome enumeration probe 17[CEP17] ratio ≥ 2.0; average HER2 copy number < 4.0 signals per cell), ISH group 3 ( HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0; average HER2 copy number ≥ 6.0 signals per cell), andISH group 4 ( HER2/CEP17 ratio < 2.0; average HER2 copy number ≥ 4.0 and < 6.0signals per cell). The diagnostic approach includes more rigorous interpretation criteria for ISH and requires concomitant IHC review for dual-probe ISH groups 2 to 4 to arrive at the most accurate HER2 status designation (positive ornegative) based on combined interpretation of the ISH and IHC assays. The Expert Panel recommends that laboratories using single-probe ISH assays includeconcomitant IHC review as part of the interpretation of all single-probe ISHassay results.
