Identifyinghigh-risk patients could help inform strategies to promote return to work. Wesystematically reviewed observational studies to explore factors associated with unemployment after breast cancer surgery. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE,CINAHL, and PsycINFO to identify studies that explored risk factors forunemployment after breast cancer surgery. When possible, we pooled estimates ofassociation for all independent variables reported by more than one study.Results Twenty-six studies (46,927 patients) reported the association of 127variables with unemployment after breast cancer surgery. Access to universalhealth care was associated with higher rates of unemployment (26.6% v 15.4%; testof interaction P = .05). High-quality evidence showed that unemployment afterbreast cancer surgery was associated with high psychological job demands (oddsratio [OR], 4.26; 95% CI, 2.27 to 7.97), childlessness (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11 to1.53), lower education level (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.25), lower income level(OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.73), cancer stage II, III or IV (OR, 1.43; 95% CI,1.13 to 1.82), and mastectomy versus breast-conserving surgery (OR, 1.18; 95% CI,1.07 to 1.30). Moderate-quality evidence suggested an association with highphysical job demands (OR, 2.11; 95%CI, 1.52 to 2.93), African-American ethnicity (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.96), and receipt of chemotherapy (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.36 to 2.79). High-quality evidence demonstrated no significant association withpart-time hours, blue-collar work, tumor size, positive lymph nodes, or receiptof radiotherapy or endocrine therapy; moderate-quality evidence suggested noassociation with age, marital status, or axillary lymph node dissection.Conclusion Addressing high physical and psychological job demands may beimportant in reducing unemployment after breast cancer surgery.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.77.3663 PMID: 29757686
