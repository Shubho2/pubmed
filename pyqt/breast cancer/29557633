Rd , Taipei , Taiwan 10608 , ROC.Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a highly orchestrated processmotivated by the nature of physical and chemical compositions of the tumormicroenvironment (TME). The role of the physical framework of the TME in guiding cells toward EMT is poorly understood. To investigate this, breast cancerMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were cultured on nanochips comprising tantalum oxidenanodots ranging in diameter from 10 to 200 nm, fabricated throughelectrochemical approach and collectively referred to as artificialmicroenvironments. The 100 and 200 nm nanochips induced the cells to adopt anelongated or spindle-shaped morphology. The key EMT genes, E-cadherin,N-cadherin, and vimentin, displayed the spatial control exhibited by theartificial microenvironments. The E-cadherin gene expression was attenuated,whereas those of N-cadherin and vimentin were amplified by 100 and 200 nmnanochips, indicating the induction of EMT. Transcription factors, snail andtwist, were identified for modulating the EMT genes in the cells on theseartificial microenvironments. Localization of EMT proteins observed throughimmunostaining indicated the loss of cell-cell junctions on 100 and 200 nmnanochips, confirming the EMT induction. Thus, by utilizing an in vitro approach,we demonstrate how the physical framework of the TME may possibly trigger orassist in inducing EMT in vivo. Applications in the fields of drug discovery,biomedical engineering, and cancer research are expected.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b19467 PMID: 29557633
