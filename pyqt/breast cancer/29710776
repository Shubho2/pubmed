The use of in vivopreclinical mouse models for assessing metastasis is, therefore, critical fordeveloping effective new cancer biomarkers and therapies. Although a number ofquantitative tools have been previously developed to study in vivo metastasis,the detection and quantification of rare metastatic events has remainedchallenging. This review will discuss the use of circulating tumor cell (CTC)analysis as an effective means of tracking and characterizing metastatic disease progression in preclinical mouse models of breast and prostate cancer and theresulting lessons learned about CTC and metastasis biology. We will also discuss how the use of clinically-relevant CTC technologies such as the CellSearch&reg;and Parsortix&trade; platforms for preclinical CTC studies can serve to enhancethe study of cancer biology, new biomarkers, and novel therapies from the benchto the bedside.DOI: 10.3390/diagnostics8020030 PMCID: PMC6023422PMID: 29710776
