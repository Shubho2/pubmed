We identified potentially relevant articles through a search ofelectronic databases which included all studies of pesticide exposure and humancancer. A total of 18 articles were selected, including six identified from thelist of references of other articles. Most articles were based on analyzes of theAgriculture Health Study (AHS); they provided no evidence of an increased risk ofcancers of colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, melanoma, female breast, prostate,urinary bladder, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (including its main subtypes),and leukemia. An increased risk of multiple myeloma was reported among AHSmembers with the highest tertile of estimated permethrin exposure (odds ratio5.01; 95% confidence interval 2.41-10.42; p for trend <0.01). A subsequentanalysis with a larger number of cases found a less pronounced associationbetween permethrin exposure and risk of multiple myeloma; no exposed cases werereported in a separate study. Two case-control studies of childhood leukemiareported an association with biological markers of permethrin metabolites; inanother study self-reported exposure to permethrin was associated with risk inchildren below 1â€‰year of age, but not in older children. In conclusion,permethrin exposure does not seem to entail a risk of cancer in humans. Resultson multiple myeloma and childhood leukemia are weak and inconsistent, and requirereplication in independent populations.DOI: 10.1080/10408444.2018.1439449 PMID: 29687728
