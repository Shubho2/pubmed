Associationsbetween greater use of advanced imaging and less-aggressive end-of-life care inreal-world practice has not been examined.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of SEER-Medicare data on patients who died from breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer between 2002 and 2007.Hospital referral region (HRR)-level use of computerized tomography (CT),magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography was categorized bytertile of imaging use and correlated with hospice enrollment overall and latehospice enrollment using multivariable logistic regression.RESULTS: A total of 55,058 patients met study criteria. Hospice use ranged from50.8% (colorectal cancer) to 62.1% (prostate cancer). In multivariable analyses, hospital referral regions (HRRs) with high rates of CT imaging were associatedwith lower odds of hospice enrollment (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.90) andlate enrollment among those who did enroll (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.26-1.76).HRRs with the highest rates of CT use were predominantly located in the Midwestand Northeast and associated with higher percentage population of black patients (14.5 vs 5.6%), greater comorbidity (28.4 vs 23.7%), metropolitan residence (93.9vs 78.5%), and less than high school education (26.4 vs 19.3%).CONCLUSION: In this population-based retrospective study, we did not observeevidence that overall and timely hospice are associated with higher rates ofimaging near the end of life. An observed association between higher rates ofimaging, particularly CT, may be explained in part by HRR-level differences inpractice patterns and patient demographic characteristics. Further research iswarranted to explore the ability of oncologic imaging to appropriatelyde-escalate care.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4223-0 PMID: 29728843
