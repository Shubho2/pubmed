This is particularly important during cell migration,where cell communication can alter both the speed and the direction of migration.However, most cell culture systems operate with large volumes relative to cellnumbers, creating low cell densities and diluting factors that mediate cellcommunication. Furthermore, they lack the ability to isolate single cells orsmall groups of cells. Droplet forming devices allow for an ability to embedsingle or small groups of cells into small volume segregated 3D environments,increasing the cell density to physiological levels. In this paper we show amicrofluidic droplet device for fabricating 3D collagen-based microtissues tostudy breast cancer cell motility. MDA-MB-231 cells fail to spread and divide in small, thin chambers. Cell migration is also stunted as compared to thick 3Dgels. However, larger chambers formed by a thicker devices promote cellspreading, cell division and faster migration. In the large devices, bothcell-ECM and cell-cell interactions affect cell motility. Increasing collagendensity decreases cell migration and increasing the number of cells per chamberincreases cell migration speed. Furthermore, cells appear to sense both theECM-chamber wall interface as well as other cells. Cells migrate towards theECM-chamber interface if within roughly 150 μm, whereas cells further than 150 μmtend to move towards the center of the chamber. Finally, while cells do not show enhanced movement towards the center of mass of a cell cluster, their migrationspeed is more variable when further away from the cell cluster center of mass.These results show that microfluidic droplet devices can array 3D collagen gelsand promote cell spreading, division and migration similar to what is seen inthick 3D collagen gels. Furthermore, they can provide a new avenue to study cell migration and cell-cell communication at physiologically relevant cell densities.DOI: 10.1007/s10544-018-0309-1 PMID: 30062494
