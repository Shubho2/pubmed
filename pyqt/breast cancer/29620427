Fiveanalogues produced ≥62% HSD1 inhibition at 5 µM and, furthermore, three of themproduced ≥68% inhibition at 1 µM. A docking-based structure-activity relationshipanalysis was done to determine the molecular basis of the inhibition and thecross-reactivity of the analogues was tested against oestrogen receptor,aromatase, cytochrome P450 1A2, and monoamine oxidases. Most of the analogues areonly modestly active with 17-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 - a requirement forlowering effective oestradiol levels in vivo. Moreover, the analysis led to thesynthesis and discovery of 3-imidazolecoumarin as a potent aromatase inhibitor.In short, coumarin core can be tailored with specific ring and polar moietysubstitutions to block either the sulphatase pathway or the aromatase pathway fortreating breast cancer and endometriosis.DOI: 10.1080/14756366.2018.1452919 PMCID: PMC6010071PMID: 29620427  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
