Epub 2018 Mar 22.Aromatase inhibitors are associated with a higher fracture risk than tamoxifen: asystematic review and meta-analysis.Tseng OL(1), Spinelli JJ(2), Gotay CC(2), Ho WY(3), McBride ML(2), Dawes MG(4).Author information: (1)Department of Family Practice, University of British Columbia, 3rd floor DavidStrangway Building, 5950 University Boulevard Building, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3,Canada.(2)Cancer Control Research Department, BC Cancer Research Centre, BC, CanadaSchool of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, BC,Canada.(3)Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.(4)Department of Family Practice, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.Background: In this paper, our aim was to systematically evaluate publishedevidence of bone fracture risk associated with tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitorsin women aged 65 and under, and diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer.Methods: We comprehensively searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases fromJanuary 1997 through May 2015, and reference lists of the selected articles toidentify English-language randomized controlled trials and cohort studies offracture risk. Two independent reviewers screened articles and assessedmethodological quality using Risk of Bias assessment for randomized controlledtrials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. Fracture risk wasestimated as pooled risk ratios using a random-effects model and inverse variancemethod.Results: Of 1926 identified articles, 21 independent studies fulfilled ourselection criteria. Similar fracture risk was observed in women treated and nottreated with tamoxifen [pooled risk ratio (RR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI)0.84-1.07]. A 35% (95% CI 1.21-1.51) higher fracture risk was observed in thearomatase inhibitor group compared with the tamoxifen group. A 17% (95% CI1.07-1.28) higher fracture risk was observed in the aromatase inhibitor groupthan the no aromatase inhibitor group. Compared with the tamoxifen group,aromatase inhibitor-associated fracture risk increased by 33% (pooled RR 1.33;95% CI 1.21-1.47) during the tamoxifen/aromatase inhibitor treatment period, but did not increase (pooled RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.72-1.37) during thepost-tamoxifen/aromatase inhibitor treatment period.Conclusions: Fracture risk is significantly higher in women treated witharomatase inhibitors, especially during the treatment period. Tamoxifen is notassociated with lower fracture risk while tamoxifen could potentially preservebone mass. Better osteoporosis management programs, especially during thetreatment period, are needed for this group of women.DOI: 10.1177/1759720X18759291 PMCID: PMC5871065PMID: 29619093
