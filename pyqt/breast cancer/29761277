Forty patients were treated by endoscopic thyroidectomy via thechest-breast approach (endoscopic group) and thirty-six patients were treated by open surgery (open group). Serum thyroglobulin (sTg), radioactive iodine uptake(RAIU), radioactive technetium uptake (RATU), radionuclide imaging of the thyroidresidual area (RITRA), radionuclide imaging of suspicious lymph nodes metastasis (RISLNM), and other general indexes were analyzed and compared between the twogroups.RESULTS: All surgeries were successfully completed in both groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding gender (P = 0.120),postoperative hospital stay (P = 0.766), operation time (P = 0.065),intra-operative blood loss (P = 0.064), tumor diameter (P = 0.059), and overallcomplications (P = 0.828). Among these complications, there was no significantdifference between the two approaches in transient hypoparathryoidism(P = 0.771), transient recurrent laryngeal injury (P = 0.474) and serious neckskin traction sensation (2.5 vs. 0%, P = 1.000). Age and body mass index werelower in the endoscopic group than the open group (P < 0.05). No significantdifference was found in special factors between two groups concerning surgicalrange (P = 0.872), RAIU-2 h/24 h (P = 0.660/P = 0.955), RATU (P = 0.116), number of dissected lymph nodes (P = 0.157), sTg before radioiodine therapy (P = 0.188),sTg after radioiodine therapy (P = 0.159), RITRA at different time points (99mTc 15 min: P = 0.144; 131I 24 h: P = 0.243; 131I 72 h: P = 0.624) and RISLNM (none: P = 0.805; central: P = 0.744; lateral: P = 1.000; central + lateral: P = 0.958).CONCLUSION: Endoscopic total thyroidectomy and central lymph nodes dissection viaa chest-breast approach are safe and effective. Through the detection of thepostoperative special factors, a well-trained surgeon can achieve similartherapeutic results for selected patients with DTC, compared with open surgery.DOI: 10.1007/s00464-018-6221-1 PMID: 29761277
