MATERIAL ANDMETHODS Non-proliferative catheter of breast fibroadenoma (FA) and IDC were used as the normal control and experimental group, respectively. Immunohistochemical(IHC) staining and Western blot (WB) analysis was used to assess proteinexpression levels of ADAMTS8, ADAMTS18, and ADAMTS20 in both FA and IDC tissues. The results of IHC, the relationship between the protein expression and the tumormolecular classification, and clinical pathological parameters were allevaluated. RESULTS IHC and WB results showed that the expression of ADAMTS8/18 inIDC samples was higher than in FA samples, while the expression of ADAMTS20 inIDC samples was lower than that in FA samples. According to the results of WB,the level of ADAMTS8 was higher in the HER2+ group than in the HER2- group and FAgroup. The expression of ADAMTS18 in the HR+ (including ER+ and PR+) group wassignificantly higher than in the HR- group and FA group. The expression ofADAMTS18 protein was also higher in the Ki67+ group than in the Ki67- group.ADAMTS20 was higher in HER2+ IDC compared with the basal subtype of IDC.CONCLUSIONS ADAMTS8/18/20 levels were not significantly correlated to themolecular subtype of IDC. ADAMTS18/20 was significantly associated withhistological grade of IDC. ADAMTS8 may predict poor prognosis results of IDCpatients.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.907310 PMCID: PMC6014152PMID: 29860265
