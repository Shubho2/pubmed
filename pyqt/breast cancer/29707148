In the presentstudy we demonstrated that dual anti-platelet therapy based on aspirin andclopidogrel (ASA+Cl), a routine regiment in cardiovascular patients, when givento cancer-bearing mice injected orthotopically with 4T1 breast cancer cells,promoted progression of the disease and reduced mice survival in association withinduction of vascular mimicry (VM) in primary tumour. In contrast, treatment withASA+Cl or platelet depletion did reduce pulmonary metastasis in mice, if 4T1cells were injected intravenously. In conclusion, distinct platelet-dependentmechanisms inhibited by ASA+Cl treatment promoted cancer malignancy and VM in thepresence of primary tumour and afforded protection against pulmonary metastasisin the absence of primary tumour. In view of our data, long-term inhibition ofplatelet function by dual anti-platelet therapy (ASA+Cl) might pose a hazard whenapplied to a patient with undiagnosed and untreated malignant cancer prone toundergo VM.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24891 PMCID: PMC5915156PMID: 29707148
