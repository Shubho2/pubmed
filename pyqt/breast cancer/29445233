A novel series of lanthanide (i.e., praseodymium (Pr), erbium (Er), and ytterbium (Yb))-basedSBL metal complexes was successfully synthesized, and their functional groupswere elaborately demonstrated using UV-visible, Fourier transform infrared(FT-IR), and fluorescence spectroscopy analyses. FT-IR spectral studies revealed that SBL behaved as a bidentate ligand and it was structured with metal ions bythe two azomethine nitrogens. The synthesized SBL-based metal complexes wereelaborately performed for cytotoxicity activity versus Vero, human breast cancer (MCF7), and cervical (HeLa) anticancer cell lines.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-21366-1 PMCID: PMC5812993PMID: 29445233
