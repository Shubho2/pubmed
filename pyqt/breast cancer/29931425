We provide data on the prevalence of CTCs 2 and 5 years after primarydiagnosis in a cohort of patients with EBC.METHODS: The SUCCESS study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized trialcomparing PFS in primary breast cancer patients undergoing one of two adjuvantchemotherapy regimens followed by 2 versus 5 years of treatment with zoledronate.CTCs from patients without signs of breast cancer recurrence were analyzed inperipheral blood using the FDA cleared CellSearch® System (Veridex, USA) 2 and5 years after primary diagnosis.RESULTS: CTCs were detected at 2 and 5 years after primary diagnosis in 96(16.7%) and 47 (8.2%) of the 574 patients, respectively. There were noassociations between CTC status and patient and tumor characteristics ortreatment regimens. In 442 (77.0%) patients, no CTCs were detected at either ofthe two time points, and in 11 patients (1.9%), CTCs were found at both 2 and5 years after primary diagnosis. In 85 (14.8%) patients, CTCs were present2 years after primary diagnosis but not after 5 years, while 36 (6.3%) patientshad CTCs in their blood only at the 5-year follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: In patients with EBC, CTCs can be detected even 5 years afterprimary diagnosis without clinical signs of disease recurrence.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4856-1 PMID: 29931425
