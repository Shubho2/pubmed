Risk ofVMS after diagnosis was positively associated with prior chemotherapy (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.21-2.68) and adjuvant hormone therapy (aOR 2.73, 95% CI 2.08-3.58),postmenopausal hormone therapy use (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.30-2.13), prior VMS (aOR2.20, 95% CI 1.73-2.80), bilateral oophorectomy (aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.37-2.27), andbaseline antidepressant use (aOR 1.49, 1.06-2.09). VMS post-diagnosis were lesslikely among younger women (aOR 0.94, 95% CI 0.93-0.96), women younger atmenopause (aOR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-1.00), women with more time since diagnosis (aOR0.92, 95% CI 0.90-0.94), and diabetics (aOR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.95). Metabolicsyndrome was not associated with post-diagnosis VMS (aOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.45-1.28).CONCLUSIONS: VMS following breast cancer diagnosis was related to a number ofmodifiable factors, but was unrelated to metabolic syndrome.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Identification of factors that predisposewomen to VMS following a breast cancer diagnosis may allow clinicians torecognize and address VMS in the subset of women who are most likely toexperience such symptoms.DOI: 10.1007/s11764-018-0677-9 PMCID: PMC5955842PMID: 29427202
