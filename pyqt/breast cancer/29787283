Therefore,imaging and therapeutic agents targeted to angiogenic vessels may be widelyapplicable in many types of cancer. To this end, the theranostic isotope pair,86Y and 90Y, were used to create a pair of agents for targeted imaging andtherapy of neovasculature in murine breast cancer models using a chimericanti-CD105 antibody, TRC105. Serial positron emission tomography imaging with86Y-DTPA-TRC105 demonstrated high uptake in 4T1 tumors, peaking at 9.6 Â±0.3%ID/g, verified through ex vivo studies. Additionally, promising results were obtained in therapeutic studies with 90Y-DTPA-TRC105, wherein significantly ( p <0.05) decreased tumor volumes were observed for the targeted treatment group overall control groups near the end of the study. Dosimetric extrapolation and tissuehistological analysis corroborated trends found in vivo. Overall, this studydemonstrated the potential of the pair 86/90Y for theranostics, enablingpersonalized treatments for cancer.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00133 PMCID: PMC6028311 [Available on 2019-07-02]PMID: 29787283
