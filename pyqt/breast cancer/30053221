TIP60 downregulation is an early event in tumorigenesis which hasbeen observed in several cancer types including breast and colorectal cancers.However, the mechanism by which it regulates tumor progression is not wellunderstood. In this study, we identified the role of TIP60 in the silencing ofendogenous retroviral elements (ERVs). TIP60-mediated silencing of ERVs isdependent on BRD4. TIP60 and BRD4 positively regulate the expression of enzymes, SUV39H1 and SETDB1 and thereby, the global H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) level.In colorectal cancer, we found that the loss of TIP60 de-repressesretrotransposon elements genome-wide, which in turn activate the cellularresponse to pathogens, mediated by STING, culminating in an induction ofInterferon Regulatory Factor 7 (IRF7) and associated inflammatory response. Insummary, this study has identified a unique mechanism of ERV regulation in cancercells mediated by TIP60 and BRD4 through regulation of histone H3 K9trimethylation, and a new tumor suppressive role of TIP60 in vivo.DOI: 10.1093/nar/gky659 PMID: 30053221
