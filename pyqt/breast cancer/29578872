Breast cancer also shows PSMAexpression. We present the case of a 30-year-old woman with triple-negativebilateral breast carcinoma who underwent bilateral mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. She developed a left chest wall and liver recurrence after primary therapy. Her recurrent disease was also triple-negative. In view of the knownpoor prognosis and very limited therapeutic options, we performed Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan to explore the possibility of PSMA-based therapy as a future option afterexhausting standard-of-care treatments.DOI: 10.1097/RLU.0000000000002071 PMID: 29578872
