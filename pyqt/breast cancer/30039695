Aqueous GSNO stability shielded within theassembled environments of the GSNO-HANPs was greatly enhanced, compared to thatof free GSNO. The NO release from the GSNO-HANPs was facilitated in the presence of hyaluronidase-1 (Hyal-1) and ascorbic acid at intracellular concentrations.Microscopic analysis showed GSNO-HANPs effectively generated NO within the cells.We observed that NO made the human MCF-7 breast cancer cells vulnerable to DOX.This chemosensitizing activity was supported by the observation of an increasedlevel of ONOO- (peroxynitrite), a highly reactive oxygen species, uponco-treatment with the GSNO-HANPs and DOX. Apoptosis assays showed that GSNO-HANP alone exhibited negligible cytotoxic effects and reinforced apoptotic activity ofDOX. Animal experiments demonstrated the effective accumulation of GSNO-HANPs in solid MCF-7 tumors and effectively suppressed tumor growth in combination withDOX. This hyaluronic acid-based intracellularly NO-releasing nanoparticles mayserve as a significant chemosensitizing agent in treatments of various cancers.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b06848 PMID: 30039695
