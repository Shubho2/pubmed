However, for patients with spinalmetastasis, who all have identical stage IV disease, identifying accurateprognostic markers of survival would allow better treatment stratificationbetween more aggressive treatment strategies or palliation. Analyticalmorphometrics enables physicians to quantify patient frailty by measuring leanmuscle mass. Morphometrics also predicts survival in patients with lung cancermetastases to the spine.PURPOSE: Our study evaluates whether morphometrics is predictive of survival inpatients with breast cancer spinal metastasis.DESIGN: This is an observational retrospective cohort study.PATIENT SAMPLE: This study includes female patients with breast cancer spinalmetastases and patients who have undergone stereotactic body radiation therapy.OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall survival was the primary outcome measure.METHODS: Morphometric measurements of the psoas muscle were taken using computed tomography scans of the lumbar spine. We then stratified patients into tertilesbased on the psoas muscle area.RESULTS: We identified 118 patients, with a median survival of 104 days (95%confidence interval [CI]=73-157 days). Overall survival was not associated withage, chemotherapy, or number of levels radiated. Patients in the lowest tertileof psoas size had significantly shorter survival compared with the highesttertile (68 days versus 148 days, hazard ratio 1.76 [95% CI=1.08-2.89], p=.024). The shorter survival was also true for the lowest tertile versus the middletertile (68 days versus 167 days, hazard ratio 1.95 [95% CI=1.19-3.19], p=.007). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to visually illustrate the differences in survival between different tertiles.CONCLUSIONS: Morphometric analysis of the psoas muscle size in patients withbreast cancer metastases to the spine was effective in identifying patients atrisk of shorter survival. Further research is needed to validate these results,as well as to see if these methodologies can be applied to other cancerhistologies.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
