This study analyzed pooled, longer-term PALOMA safety datalongitudinally.Methods: Data were pooled from three randomized phase II and III studies(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00721409, NCT01740427, NCT01942135) of hormonereceptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‒negative advancedbreast cancer patients. Front-line patients were randomly assigned to receiveletrozole with/without palbociclib (PALOMA-1) or letrozole pluspalbociclib/placebo (PALOMA-2). In PALOMA-3, patients with prior endocrineresistance received fulvestrant plus palbociclib/placebo. The cumulative eventrates of adverse events (AEs), reporting up to 50 months of treatment, wereassessed over time.Results: Patients who received endocrine therapy (n = 1343) were included in thispooled analysis (872 were also treated with palbociclib, and 471 were not). Themost common AEs with palbociclib plus endocrine therapy were neutropenia andinfections (any grade, 80.6% and 54.7%, respectively), which were higher than in the endocrine monotherapy arm (any grade, 5.3% and 36.9%). The most commonhematologic AEs (≥15.0% in the palbociclib arm) were more likely to be reportedin the initial months of the study, after which time the cumulative event ratedid not substantially increase. With palbociclib plus endocrine therapy, anygrade AEs leading to permanent discontinuation over three years occurred in only 8.3% of patients.Conclusions: Based on these long-term safety analyses, there is no evidence ofspecific cumulative or delayed toxicities with palbociclib plus endocrinetherapy, supporting the ongoing investigation of palbociclib plus endocrinetherapy in early breast cancer (NCT02513394).DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy109 PMID: 30032196
