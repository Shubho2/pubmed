MSCs have been shown to migrate towards inflamed or cancerous tissues, and visualized after sacrificing the animal. MSCs are able to deliver drugs totarget cells, and are an ideal candidate for cancer therapy. The purpose of this study was to track the migration of MSCs in tumor-bearing mice; MSCs were alsoused as drug delivery vehicles. Human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) andanaplastic thyroid cancer cells (CAL62) were transduced with lentiviralparticles, to express the Renilla luciferase and mCherry (mCherry-Rluc) reporter genes. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were transduced with lentiviral particles, to express the firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluorescence protein(Fluc2-eGFP) reporter genes (MSC/Fluc). Luciferase activity of the transducedcells was measured by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Further in vitro migrationassays were performed to confirm cancer cells conditioned medium dependent MSCand doxorubicin (DOX) treated MSC migration. MSCs were loaded with DOX, and theirtherapeutic effects against the cancer cells were studied in vitro. In vivoMSC/Fluc migration in mice having thyroid or breast cancer xenografts wasevaluated after systemic injection. Rluc activity of CAL62/Rluc (R2=0.911),MDA-MB-231/Rluc (R2=0.934) cells and Fluc activity of MSC/Fluc (R2=0.91) cellsincreased with increasing cell numbers, as seen by BLI. eGFP expression ofMSC/Fluc was confirmed by confocal microscopy. Similar migration potential wasobserved between MSC/Fluc and na√Øve MSCs in migration assay. DOX treated MSCsmigration was not decreased compared than MSCs. Migration of the systemicallyinjected MSC/Fluc cells into tumor xenografts (thyroid and breast cancer) wasvisualized in animal models (p<0.05) and confirmed by ex vivo (p<0.05) BLI.Additionally, MSCs delivered DOX to CAL62/Rluc and MDA-MB-231/Rluc cells, therebydecreasing their Rluc activities. In this study, we confirmed the migration ofMSCs to tumor sites in cancer xenograft models using both in vivo and ex vivo BLIimaging. DOX-pretreated MSCs showed enhanced cytotoxic effects. Therefore, thisnoninvasive reporter gene (Fluc2)-based BLI may be useful for visualizing in vivotracking of MSCs, which can be used as a drug delivery vehicle for cancertherapy.DOI: 10.7150/ijms.25760 PMCID: PMC6036160PMID: 30013447
