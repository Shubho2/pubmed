Spindle cell carcinoma is a rare variant of thisspecial histological type. Its prognosis remains poor, with a high rate of local recurrence and distant metastasis. To date, only a small number of cases havebeen described. There is no clear agreement on this histological subtype.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 53-year-old Moroccan woman who consultedour institution following palpation of a nodule of the left breast. Mammographyin combination with breast ultrasonography revealed a lesion classified as BreastImaging Reporting and Data System 4 with microcalcification. The patient wasdiagnosed with spindle cell carcinoma of the breast. The diagnosis was basedprimarily on histological and immunohistochemical studies of the breast biopsyand secondarily on the surgical specimen. No local or distant metastasis wasfound. The treatment used was total surgical excision followed by radiotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: We describe the features (epidemiological, clinical, histological,immunohistochemical, and therapeutic outcomes) of our patient's case and compare them with literature data.DOI: 10.1186/s13256-017-1553-3 PMCID: PMC5820794PMID: 29463294
