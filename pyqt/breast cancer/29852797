Epub2018 Jun 1.Progesterone, progestins and the breast in menopause treatment.Gompel A(1), Plu-Bureau G(1).Author information: (1)a Unité de Gynécologie Endocrinienne, Université Paris Descartes Hôpitaux,Universitaires Port Royal-Cochin , Paris , France.Breast cancer is the main risk associated with menopause hormone therapy (MHT).It is a hormone-dependent cancer. In postmenopausal women, about 80% of cases areestradiol receptor-positive. In cohort studies only estradiol receptor-positivebreast cancers are promoted by MHT. Different levels of risk with estrogen-onlytreatment and combined treatment with estrogen + progestin are shown inrandomized trials and observational studies. Several non-randomized studies show a lower risk with progesterone and retroprogesterone than with syntheticprogestins. Progesterone and progestin are non-selective ligands for theprogesterone receptor and bind also with other steroid receptors, with agonistic or antagonistic effects according to the structure of the molecule. Theirhalf-life and metabolism are also different, progesterone being rapidly degraded with a short half-life. These aspects will be discussed in this review.DOI: 10.1080/13697137.2018.1476483 PMID: 29852797
