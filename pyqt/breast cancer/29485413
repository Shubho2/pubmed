This studyuncovers the functional role and clinical significance of EBI3 in breast cancerpatients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression levels of EBI3, IL-27p28, and IL-12p35 were measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chainreaction (PCR). Correlations of EBI3 expression with IL-27p28 and IL-12p35expression were analyzed using Pearson's correlation assay. The prognosticperformance of EBI3 was assessed via Kaplan-Meier survival assay and Coxregression analysis.RESULTS: EBI3 expression was increased in cancerous tissues compared with thecontrols (P < 0.05). This overexpression of EBI3 was correlated with lymph nodemetastasis and clinical stage (both P < 0.05). Besides, elevated expression ofEBI3 was usually found in patients with positive lymph node metastasis (P <0.05), and similar results were obtained in advanced clinical-stage breast cancercases (P < 0.05). Increases in both IL-27p28 and IL-12p35 expression wereidentified in breast cancer tissues (all P < 0.05), and IL-12p35 expression wasfound to be associated with EBI3 expression (R = 0.888, P < 0.001). Survivalcurves revealed that high EBI3 expression was correlated with poor overallsurvival (log-rank P < 0.05). The Cox analysis indicated that EBI3 was anindependent prognostic factor in breast cancer.CONCLUSION: Taken together, overexpression of EBI3 was associated with poorprognosis and might be involved in the progression of breast cancer.Â© 2018 S.
