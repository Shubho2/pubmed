Psychological and ethical aspects play a crucial role inPABC: the highest priority not to damage the foetus significantly complicates anytreatment generally, and it is quite usual that patients disclaim undergoing any breast cancer treatment during pregnancy. Although, due to global demographictrends, PABC is far from appearing rarely now, severe societal and economicconsequences of the disease are still neglected by currently applied reactivemedical approach. These actualities require creating new strategies which should be better adapted to the needs of the society at large by advancing the PABC carebased on predictive diagnostic approaches specifically in premenopausal women,innovative screening programmes focused on young female populations, targetedprevention in high-risk groups, and optimised treatment concepts. The articlesummarises the facts and provides recommendations to advance the field-relatedresearch and medical services specifically dedicated to the PABC care.DOI: 10.1007/s13167-018-0129-7 PMCID: PMC5833893 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29515683
