We were prompted to decipher the mechanismof HMGA1a-induced alternative splicing of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) that we recently reported would alter tamoxifen sensitivity in MCF-7 TAMR1 cells.Methods: Endogenous expression of full length ERα66 and its isoform ERα46 wereevaluated in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by transient expression of HMGA1a and anRNA decoy (2'-O-methylated RNA of the HMGA1a RNA-binding site) that binds toHMGA1a. RNA-binding of HMGA1a was checked by RNA-EMSA. In vitro splicing assaywas performed to check the direct involvement of HMGA1a in splicing regulation.RNA-EMSA assay in the presence of purified U1 snRNP was performed with psoralenUV crosslinking to check complex formation of HMGA1a-U1 snRNP at the upstreampseudo-5' splice site of exon 1. Results: HMGA1a induced exon skipping of ashortened exon 1 of ERα in in vitro splicing assays that was blocked by theHMGA1a RNA decoy and sequence-specific RNA-binding was confirmed by RNA-EMSA.RNA-EMSA combined with psoralen UV crosslinking showed that HMGA1a trappedpurified U1 snRNP at the upstream pseudo-5' splice site. Conclusions: Regulation of ERα alternative splicing by an HMGA1a-trapped U1 snRNP complex at the upstream5' splice site of exon 1 offers novel insight on 5' splice site regulation by U1 snRNP as well as a promising target in breast cancer therapy where alternativesplicing of ERα is involved.DOI: 10.3389/fmolb.2018.00052 PMCID: PMC6002489PMID: 29938207
