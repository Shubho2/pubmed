Dependent on histology, manypatients require additional open procedures for definitive diagnosis andexcision. This study estimated the payer and patient out-of-pocket (OOP) costs,and complication risk, among those requiring at least 1 open procedure following PCNB.Methods: This retrospective study used the Truven Commercial database(2009-2014). Women who underwent PCNB, with continuous insurance, and no history of cancer, chemotherapy, radiation, or breast surgery in the prior year wereincluded. Open procedures were defined as open biopsy or lumpectomy. Studyfollow-up ended at chemotherapy, radiation, mastectomy, or 90 days-whicheveroccurred first.Results: In total, 143 771 patients (mean age 48) met selection criteria; 85.1%underwent isolated PCNB, 12.4% one open procedure, and 2.5% re-excision.Incidence of complications was significantly lower among those with PCNB alone(9.2%) vs 1 open procedure (15.6%) or re-excision (25.3%, P < .001). Meanincremental commercial payments were US $13 190 greater among patients with 1open procedure vs PCNB alone (US $17 125 vs US $3935, P < .001), and US $4767greater with re-excision (US $21 892) relative to 1 procedure. Mean patient OOPcost was US $858 greater for 1 open procedure vs PCNB alone (US $1527 vs US$669), and US $247 greater for re-excision vs 1 procedure.Conclusions: A meaningful proportion of patients underwent open procedure(s)following PCNB which was associated with increased complication risk and costs toboth the payer and the patient. These results suggest a need for technologies to reduce the proportion of cases requiring open surgery and, in some cases,re-excision.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418777766 PMCID: PMC5989052PMID: 29887731
