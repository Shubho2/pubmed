Email: volker.schmid@lmu.deBackground: Among the proposals for joint disease mapping, the shared componentmodel has become more popular. Another advance to strengthen inference of diseasedata is the extension of purely spatial models to include time aspect. We aim to combine the idea of multivariate shared components with spatio-temporal modellingin a joint disease mapping model and apply it for incidence rates of sevenprevalent cancers in Iran which together account for approximately 50% of allcancers. Methods: In the proposed model, each component is shared by differentsubsets of diseases, spatial and temporal trends are considered for eachcomponent, and the relative weight of these trends for each component for eachrelevant disease can be estimated. Results: For esophagus and stomach cancers theNorthern provinces was the area of high risk. For colorectal cancer Gilan,Semnan, Fars, Isfahan, Yazd and East-Azerbaijan were the highest risk provinces. For bladder and lung cancer, the northwest were the highest risk area. Forprostate and breast cancers, Isfahan, Yazd, Fars, Tehran, Semnan, Mazandaran and Khorasane-Razavi were the highest risk part. The smoking component, shared byesophagus, stomach, bladder and lung, had more effect in Gilan, Mazandaran,Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Kohgilouyeh and Boyerahmad, Ardebil and Tehranprovinces, in turn. For overweight and obesity component, shared by esophagus,colorectal, prostate and breast cancers the largest effect was found for Tehran, Khorasane-Razavi, Semnan, Yazd, Isfahan, Fars, Mazandaran and Gilan, in turn. Forlow physical activity component, shared by colorectal and breast cancersNorth-Khorasan, Ardebil, Golestan, Ilam, Khorasane-Razavi and South-Khorasan had the largest effects, in turn. The smoking component is significantly moreimportant for stomach than for esophagus, bladder and lung. The overweight andobesity had significantly more effect for colorectal than of esophagus cancer.Conclusions: The presented model is a valuable model to model geographical andtemporal variation among diseases and has some interesting potential features andbenefits over other joint models.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.6.1553 PMID: 29936779
