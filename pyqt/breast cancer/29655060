Living survivors were identified based on recognition criteria in accordance with the Holocaust Survivor Benefits Law. The comparisongroup consisted of Clalit enrollees who were born before 1945 in Europeancountries not under Nazi occupation and were alive in 2000 or were born in anyEuropean country or America, immigrated to Israel before 1939 and were alive in2000. The incidence of malignant diseases was compared in univariate and Poisson regression models analyses, controlling for age, smoking, obesity, diabetes andplace of residence.RESULTS: The study included 294,543 Holocaust survivors, and the mean age at the beginning of follow-up was 74 ± 8.7 years; 43% males. In multivariable analyses, the rate ratio (RR) values for males and females were 1.9 and 1.3 for coloncancer, 1.9 and 1.4 for lung cancer, 1.6 and 1.4 for bladder cancer and 1.2 and1.3 for melanoma, respectively. For prostate cancer in males, the RR was 1.4,while for breast cancer in females, it was 1.2.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of malignant diseases among Holocaust survivorsresiding in Israel was higher than that among non-Holocaust survivors. Theseassociations remained statistically significant in a multivariable analysis andwere stronger for males.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
