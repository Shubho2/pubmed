China.Hirsutella sinensis fungus (HSF) is an artificial substitute of the well-knownmedicine Cordyceps sinensis with similar beneficial effects in humans. Wepreviously found that HSF can regulate immune function and inhibit tumor growth; however, the mechanisms involved in these effects were still unclear.Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the effects of HSF on immune cellsubsets in the tumor microenvironment in mice. The results showed that HSFinhibited Lewis lung cancer growth, alleviated abnormalities in routine bloodtests, and enhanced tumor-infiltrating T cells, particularly the proportion ofeffector CD8[Formula: see text] T cells. In addition, HSF also ameliorated theimmune-suppressive microenvironment and decreased the proportions of regulatory Tcell and myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations. To confirm the effects ofHSF on promotion of effector CD8[Formula: see text] T-cell production, we furtherevaluated changes in postoperative metastasis following treatment with HSF.Indeed, orthotopic lung metastasis was significantly suppressed, and survivaltimes were increased in HSF-treated mice. Taken together, our findings suggested that HSF inhibited Lewis lung cancer by enhancing the population of effectiveCD8[Formula: see text] T cells.DOI: 10.1142/S0192415X18500489 PMID: 29754506
