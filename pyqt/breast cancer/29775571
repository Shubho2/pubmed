MG cytotoxicity occurs through the induction ofapoptosis. There are multiple mechanisms by which MG can induce apoptosis, e.g., through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction of oxidativeDNA damage, or accumulation of a specific MG-derived advanced glycation endproduct (AGE).OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of MG on ROS production,KI-67 expression, and caspase-3 expression in MCF-7 cells.METHODS: At confluency, MCF-7 cells were divided into five groups, includingcontrol (untreated); and MCF-7 cells exposed to MG (1 mM) for 0; 12; 24; and 48 hof incubation. Reactive oxygen species level, KI-67 expression, and caspase-3expression were evaluated by laser scanning confocal microscopy.RESULTS: The level of reactive oxygen species was significantly lower in 12 h of incubation compared to the control group (p < .05). The reactive oxygen specieslevel was significantly higher in 48 h of incubation compared to the controlgroup (p < .05). The expressions of KI-67 was significantly higher in all groups of MCF-7 cells treated with MG compared to the control group (p < .05). Themaximal expression of KI-67 was achieved in 12 h of incubation. The expression ofKI-67 was significantly lower in 48 h of incubation compared to 12 h ofincubation (p < .05). The caspase-3 expressions were significantly greater in allgroups of MCF-7 cells treated with MG groups compared to the control group(p < .05). The maximal expression of caspase-3 was achieved in 48 h ofincubation. The increased expression of caspase-3 in 48 h of incubation wassignificantly higher compared to 0; 12; and 24 h of incubation (p < .05).CONCLUSION: Methylglyoxal at 48 h of incubation disturbs the defense mechanismsof MCF-7 cells to reactive oxygen species. This incubation time also inducesapoptosis and inhibits the cells proliferation. Therefore, this may provide anovel approach for inhibiting the breast cancer cell growth.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.yexmp.2018.05.005 PMID: 29775571
