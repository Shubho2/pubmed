Cross-sectional self-reported data were collected using paper-and-pencilquestionnaires. Descriptive analyses, Chi square-tests, and logistic regressionwere applied. Results were adjusted for educational level. Of 5387 women, 89.9%were autochthonous, 4.1% German resettlers, 2.8% Turkish, 3.1% other migrants.Participation rates regarding cancer screening differed significantly, with thelowest proportion in Turkish migrants (65.0%), resettlers (67.8%), other migrants(68.2%) and autochthonous population (78.2%). No differences in performance ofbreast self-examinations were detected. When adjusted for education, resultsindicated only slight changes in the odds to participate in screening irregularlyor not at all. Results support existing evidence by showing lower participationrates in cancer screening among migrant women, but there were no differencesregarding breast self-examinations. Migrant women form a potential high-riskgroup for late-stage diagnosis of cervical or breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10903-018-0785-7 PMID: 29987640
