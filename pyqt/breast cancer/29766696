A control group (n=74) constituted of subjects with no breast cancerdiagnosis. In every subject anthropometric measurements were taken and dietarypractices were evaluated by means of an original questionnaire.Results: Average BMI and hip circumference values were higher in the group IIthan in the group I. In both study groups the percentage of high WHR values wassignificantly higher than in the control group. Women with history of cancerconsumed significantly fewer vegetable and fruit and more refined cereals, dairy products, meat and cold cuts than women in the control group. Group I responders more often declared implementation and maintenance of changes in their diet afterdiagnosis of cancer than women from group II. Subjects with cancer historyconsumed more alcohol and more often used supplements than females in the controlgroup.Conclusion: Avoiding overweight and obesity along with following the principlesof a healthy diet seems to reduce the risk of both breast cancer incidence andits recurrence.PMID: 29766696
