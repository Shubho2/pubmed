[Epub ahead of print]Molecular Portrait of Hypoxia in Breast Cancer: A Prognostic Signature and Novel HIF-regulated Genes.Ye IC(1), Fertig EJ(2), DiGiacomo JW(3), Considine M(4), Godet I(5), GilkesDM(6).Author information: (1)Oncology, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns HopkinsUniversity School of Medicine.(2)Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.(3)Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University.(4)Oncology, Johns Hopkins University.(5)Oncology and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Johns HopkinsUniversity.(6)Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine dgilkes1@jhu.edu.Intratumoral hypoxia has been associated with invasion, metastasis, and treatmentfailure, prompting the need for a global characterization of the response tohypoxic conditions. The current study presents the results of a large-scale RNAsequencing (RNA-seq) effort, analyzing 31 breast cancer cell lines representativeof breast cancer subtypes or normal mammary epithelial (NME) cells exposed tocontrol tissue culture conditions (20% O2) or hypoxic conditions (1% O2). Theresults demonstrate that NME have a stronger response to hypoxia both in terms ofnumber of genes induced by hypoxia as well as level of expression. A conserved42-gene hypoxia signature shared across PAM50 subtypes and genes that areexclusively upregulated in Luminal A, Luminal B, and Normal-like mammaryepithelial cells is identified. The 42-gene expression signature is enriched in asubset of Basal-like cell lines and tumors, and differentiates survival amongpatients with Basal-like tumors. Mechanistically, the hypoxia inducible factors(HIF-1 and/or HIF-2) mediate the conserved hypoxic response. Also, four novelhypoxia-regulated and HIF-1 responsive genes were identified as part of theconserved signature. This dataset provides a novel resource to querytranscriptional changes that occur in response to hypoxia and serves as astarting point for a clinical assay to aid in stratifying patients that wouldbenefit from hypoxia-targeted therapies some of which are currently in clinicaltrials.IMPLICATIONS: RNA sequencing of 31 breast cancer cells exposed to control or hypoxic conditions reveals a conserved genomic signature containing novelHIF-regulated genes and is prognostic for survival of TNBC patients.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0345 PMID: 30037853
