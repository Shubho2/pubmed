China .BACKGROUND: The long noncoding RNA HOTAIR (HOX transcript antisense intergenicRNA) has been reported to be a biomarker for various malignant tumors; however,its involvement in breast cancer is not fully understood. The aim of this studywas to investigate the effects involved with long noncoding RNA HOTAIR and EZH2(enhancer of zeste homologue 2) on the processes of proliferation, invasion,migration, and apoptosis of breast cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expressions of HOTAIR and EZH2 in both normal humanmammary epithelial cell (HBL-100) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7,MDA-MB-231, and SKBR-3) were detected by means of reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The MCF-7 cells thatexhibited the highest HOTAIR expressions were selected for further studies anddivided into the control, negative control, and small interfering RNA-HOTAIRgroups. The proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis of breast cancercells were evaluated by MTT assay, Scratch test, Transwell assay, and flowcytometry, respectively. The combination of HOTAIR with EZH2 and PTEN waspredicted by bioinformation, with a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay providingfurther verification.RESULTS: Initially, lower expressions of HOTAIR and EZH2 in the normal humanmammary epithelial cells, while higher expressions in the breast cancer cells of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SKBR-3 were detected. In addition, the downregulation ofHOTAIR or silencing of EZH2 was revealed to repress the proliferation, invasion, and migration, while acting to promote the apoptosis of the breast cancer cells. Furthermore, HOTAIR could bind specifically to EZH2 and PTEN, highlighting thecapability of HOTAIR to inhibit the expression of PTEN by recruiting EZH2 inbreast cancer, while the TCGA database demonstrated the expressions of PTEN were lower in breast cancer cells.CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests the higher expressions of HOTAIR and EZH2 amongthree breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the downregulation of HOTAIR or silencingof EZH2 was noted to inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration of breastcancer cells, while promoting their apoptosis.DOI: 10.1089/cbr.2017.2432 PMID: 30048163
