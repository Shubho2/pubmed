China.As a non-histone chromatin-associated protein, high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) performs a pivotal function in various human diseases, including autoimmunediseases, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Overexpression of HMGB1 has beendemonstrated in numerous types of cancer, including breast cancer, colorectalcancer, lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the underlyingmechanism of HMGB1 function in lung cancer remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to analyze, and summarize the role and mechanism of HMGB1 in lungcancer by retrieving available literature regarding HMGB1 in association withlung cancer. It provides comprehensive information on the association of HMGB1with the carcinogenesis and progression of lung cancer, and discusses themolecular mechanism of these processes. HMGB1 may induce tumorigenesis,metastasis and chemotherapy resistance in lung cancer. Overall, it is evidentthat HMGB1 serves an important role in the development and progression of lungcancer, and this review warrants further investigation into HMGB1 as a noveltarget for cancer therapy.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8215 PMCID: PMC5920474PMID: 29725415
