HML2 is the clade ofthese viruses which contains the most intact provirus copies. These elements can be transcribed and translated in healthy and diseased tissues, and some of themproduce active retroviral enzymes, such as protease. Retroviral gene products,including protease, contribute to illness in exogenous retroviral infections.There are ongoing efforts to test anti-retroviral regimens against endogenousretroviruses. Herein, we examine the potential activity and diversity of humanendogenous retrovirus-K proteases, and their potential for impact on immunity andhuman disease. Results: Sequences similar to the endogenous retrovirus-K HML2protease and reverse transcriptase were identified in the human genome,classified by phylogenetic inference and compared to Repbase reference sequences.The topologies of trees inferred from protease and reverse transcriptasesequences were similar and agreed with the classification using referencesequences. Surprisingly, only 62/480 protease sequences identified by BLAST were classified as HML2; the remainder were classified as other HML groups, with themajority (216) classified as HML3. Variation in functionally significant proteasemotifs was explored, and two major active site variants were identified - theDTGAD variant is common in all groups, but the DTGVD motif appears limited toHML3, HML5, and HML6. Furthermore, distinct RNA expression patterns of proteasevariants are seen in disease states, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Conclusion: Transcribed ERVK proteasesexhibit a diversity which could impact immunity and inhibitor-based treatments,and these facets should be considered when designing therapeutic regimens.DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.01577 PMCID: PMC6058741PMID: 30072963
