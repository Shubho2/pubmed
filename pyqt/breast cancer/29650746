Male patients were more likely to have received all of theireligible screening maneuvers if they had had a health examination compared withfemale patients (odds ratio of 5.73 vs 3.99, respectively).CONCLUSION: Less than 60% of adults with IDD appear to be receiving comprehensivepreventive care. Future studies assessing the quality of preventive care receivedby adults with IDD should combine health examination billing codes and the PCQS.Copyright© the College of Family Physicians of Canada.PMCID: PMC5906787PMID: 29650746
