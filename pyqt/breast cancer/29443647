We examined the associationbetween system-level integration and longitudinal costs of cancer care.METHODS: We used linked SEER-Medicare data to identify patients age 66 to 99years diagnosed with prostate, bladder, esophageal, pancreatic, lung, liver,kidney, colorectal, breast, or ovarian cancer from 2007 to 2012. We attributedeach patient to one or more phases of care (ie, initial, continuing, and end oflife) according to time from diagnosis until death or end of study interval. For each phase, we aggregated all claims with the primary cancer diagnosis andidentified patients treated in an integrated delivery network (IDN), as definedby the Becker Hospital Review list of the top 100 most integrated health deliverysystems. We then determined if care provided in an IDN was associated withdecreased payments across cancers and for each individual cancer by phase andacross phases.RESULTS: We identified 428,300 patients diagnosed with one of 10 common cancers. Overall, there were no differences in phase-based payments between IDNs andnon-IDNs. Average adjusted annual payments by phase for IDN versus non-IDNs were as follows: initial, $14,194 versus $14,421, respectively ( P = .672);continuing, $2,051 versus $2,099 ( P = .566); and end of life, $16,257 versus$16,232 ( P = .948). However, in select cancers, we observed lower payments inIDNs. For bladder cancer, payments at the end of life were lower for IDNs($11,041 v $12,331; P = .008). Of the four cancers with the lowest 5-yearsurvival rates (ie, pancreatic, lung, esophageal, and liver), averageexpenditures during the initial and continuing-care phases were lower forpatients with liver cancer treated in IDNs.CONCLUSION: For patients with one of 10 common malignancies, treatment in an IDN generally is not associated with lower costs during any phase of cancer care.DOI: 10.1200/JOP.2017.027730 PMCID: PMC5847466 [Available on 2019-01-01]PMID: 29443647
