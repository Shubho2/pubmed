Here, we present improvements in our pedigree-based familial cancer variant prioritization pipeline referred asFCVPPv2, including 12 tools for evaluating deleteriousness and 5 intolerancescores for missense variants. This pipeline is also capable of assessingnon-coding regions by combining FANTOM5 data with sets of tools like Bedtools,ChromHMM, Miranda, SNPnexus and Targetscan. We tested this pipeline in a familywith history of a papillary thyroid cancer. Only one variant causing an aminoacid change G573R (dbSNP ID rs145736623, NM_019609.4:exon11:c.G1717A:p.G573R) in the carboxypeptidase gene CPXM1 survived our pipeline. This variant is located ina highly conserved region across vertebrates in the peptidase_M14 domain (Pfam IDPF00246). The CPXM1 gene may be involved in adipogenesis and extracellular matrixremodelling and it has been suggested to be a tumour suppressor in breast cancer.However, the presence of the variant in the ExAC database suggests it to be arare polymorphism or a low-penetrance risk allele. Overall, our pipeline is acomprehensive approach for prediction of predisposing variants for high-riskcancer families, for which a functional characterization is a crucial step toconfirm their role in cancer predisposition.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29952-z PMCID: PMC6072708PMID: 30072699
