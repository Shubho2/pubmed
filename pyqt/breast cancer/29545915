Thismethodology has the potential to enhance the utility of primary cell culture as amodel for mammary gland research. However, few studies have systematicallycharacterized this method in generating in vitro normal human mammary epithelial cell models.Results: We show that cells derived from fresh normal breast tissues can bepropagated and exhibit heterogeneous morphologic features. The cultures arecomposed of CK18, desmoglein 3, and CK19-positive luminal cells and vimentin,p63, and CK14-positive myoepithelial cells, suggesting the maintenance of in vivoheterogeneity. In addition, the cultures contain subpopulations with differentCD49f and EpCAM expression profiles. When grown in 3D conditions, cellsself-organize into distinct structures that express either luminal or basal cell markers. Among these structures, CK8-positive cells enclosing a lumen are capableof differentiation into milk-producing cells in the presence of lactogenicstimulus. Furthermore, our short-term cultures retain the expression of ERÎ±, aswell as its ability to respond to estrogen stimulation.Materials and Methods: We have investigated conditionally reprogrammed normalepithelial cells in terms of cell type heterogeneity, cellular marker expression,and structural arrangement in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)systems.Conclusions: The conditional reprogramming methodology allows generation of aheterogeneous culture from normal human mammary tissue in vitro. We believe that this cell culture model will provide a valuable tool to study mammary cellfunction and malignant transformation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23817 PMCID: PMC5837767PMID: 29545915
