However,the development of agents that specifically target HER2 has improved themanagement of patients with these tumours. This expert group used data frompublished literature, practical experience and opinion of a large group ofacademic oncologists to arrive at these practical consensus recommendations with regards to the use of these agents and the management of HER2 neu early breastcancer for the benefit of community oncologists.DOI: 10.4103/sajc.sajc_111_18 PMCID: PMC5909284PMID: 29721473
