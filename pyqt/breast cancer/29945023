Those molecular deliveringsystems are very important to destroy cancer cells selectively. Herein we report synthesis of phosphine-peptide conjugate (Ph2PCH2-Sar-Gly-OH, PSG) derived fromSarGly (sarcosine-glycine), which can be easily exchanged to other peptidecarriers, its oxide (OPh2PCH2-Sar-Gly-OH, OPSG) and the first copper(I) complex([CuI(dmp)(P(Ph)2CH2-Sar-Gly-OH)], 1-PSG, where dmp stands for2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline). The compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, NMR (1D, 2D), UV-Vis spectroscopy and DFT (Density Functional Theory)methods. PSG and 1-PSG proved to be stable in biological medium in the presenceof atmospheric oxygen for several days. The cytotoxicity of the compounds andcisplatin was tested against cancer cell lines: mouse colon carcinoma (CT26;1-PSGIC50 = 3.12 ± 0.1), human lung adenocarcinoma (A549; 1-PSGIC50 = 2.01 ± 0.2)and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7; 1-PSGIC50 = 0.98 ± 0.2) as well as againstprimary line of human pulmonary fibroblasts (MRC-5; 1-PSGIC50 = 78.56 ± 1.1).Therapeutic index for 1-PSG (MCF7) equals 80. Intracellular accumulation of 1-PSGcomplex increased with time and was much higher (96%) inside MCF7 cancer cellsthan in normal MRC5 cells (20%). Attachment of SarGly to cytotoxic copper(I)complex via phosphine motif improved selectivity of copper(I) complex 1-PSG into the cancer cells. Precise mechanistic study revealed that the 1-PSG complexcauses apoptotic cells MCF7 death with simultaneous decrease of mitochondrialmembrane potential and increase of caspase-9 and -3 activities. Additionally,1-PSG generated high level of reactive oxygen species that was the reason foroxidative damages to the sugar-phosphate backbone of plasmid DNA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
