The inclusion criteria comprised:no sign of primary breast cancer on clinical examination nor on imaging(mammography, ultrasonography and breast MRI) and no primary tumour identifiedelsewhere.RESULTS: CUPax represented 1.8% of all metastatic axillary lymphadenopathies inour institutions. The overall survival rate was 71%, and 16.7% of patients hadsecondary inflammatory breast cancer signalling a posteriori that CUPaxoriginated from the breast. Factors that favourably affected survival accordingto univariate analysis were: histological type of non specific adenocarcinoma(versus other types, p = 0.02), only one lymph node involved (versus several,p = 0.04), a normal CA153 serum-level (p = 0.02), no distant metastasis atinitial assessment (p = 0.02), no secondary distant metastasis (p = 0.005) andradiotherapy to the ipsilateral breast/chest wall/lymph nodes (p = 0.04). Onmultivariate analysis including these factors, a histological type ofnon-specific adenocarcinoma (p = 0.03) and distant metastases (p = 0.03) wereidentified as independent factors affecting survival.CONCLUSION: We believe that these results will shed light on currentinvestigations and treatment of this rare entity.Copyright © 2018.
