Early detection of cancer and advancement oftreatment modalities contributed to declining mortality rates. Consequently,survival rates increased, leading to a greater interest in maintaining thequality of life after cancer treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy results in animprovement in both disease-free and overall survival. However, chemotherapytreatment is associated with acute and long- term complications for cancersurvivors. A special concern of women diagnosed with reproductive-age breastcancer is their reproductive potential after chemotherapy. The chemotherapeuticagents act by different mechanisms in the ovary. DNA damage of primordialfollicle cells, leading to chemotherapy-induced oocyte apoptosis, was identified as the main mechanism responsible for the decrease of the ovarian reserve. Theoocyte initially attempts to repair DNA damage through the DNA damage repairpathway mediated by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated. For cells in which DNA damage cannot be repaired, elimination occurs via apoptosis. In this review, theclinical impact and the major mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced ovarian reserve damage will be briefly described.DOI: 10.23736/S0031-0808.18.03494-8 PMID: 29962184
