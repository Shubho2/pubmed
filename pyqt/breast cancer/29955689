In recognition of this, countries, states, and cities worldwide have implemented TFA policies aimed atreducing their availability in the food supply. Objective: This article aims toprovide an update of the evidence of the effectiveness of policies aimed atreducing TFAs in the food supply. Methods: A systematic review of the literature from 2013 onward was conducted, building on a previously published review thatexamined the evidence of the impact of TFA policies worldwide from 2000 to 2012. Studies that were 1) empirical, 2) examined a TFA policy, and 3) examined theeffect of the policy on TFA amounts and availability pre- and post-policyintervention were included. Modeling studies examining the impact of TFA policieson cardiovascular, equity, and economic outcomes were also included. Results: Atotal of 18 articles from the updated search were combined with 14 articles from the previous review (total = 32 articles). All types of TFA policies led to theirreduction; however, trans fat bans had a larger impact (TFAs virtuallyeliminated) than did voluntary (range: 20-38% reduction in TFA intakes) orlabeling (range: 30-74% reduction in TFA intakes, plasma serum, or breast-milkconcentrations) approaches to reducing TFA amounts in the food supply. Productreformulation to reduce TFAs had variable effects on saturated fatty acid (SFA)contents in these foods; however, the combined amount of TFAs and SFAs declinedin most products. Overall, the modeling studies indicated that TFA bans wouldreduce heart disease risk, benefit socioeconomically disadvantaged populationsthe most, and be cost-saving. Conclusions: Policies aimed at reducing TFAs in thefood supply are effective and will likely reduce the burden of diet-relateddisease, particularly among the most vulnerable socioeconomic groups. Althoughall policy approaches lead to reductions in TFAs in foods, TFA bans are likelythe most effective, economical, and equitable policy approach to reducing TFAs inthe food supply.DOI: 10.3945/cdn.117.000778 PMCID: PMC5998794PMID: 29955689
