Electronic address: rlnarn21@gmail.com.The combination of carotenoids and doxorubicin (DOX) selectively alters oxidativestress-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Primarily, cytotoxic efficiencyof carotenoids (β-carotene, BC; lutein, LUT; astaxanthin, AST; or fucoxanthin,FUCO) either with or without a minimal cytotoxic dose of DOX was evaluated inMCF-7 (0.12 μM) and MDA-MB-231 cells (0.28 μM). The higher cell growth inhibitionof BC and/or LUT with DOX was selected for testing in further cell-based assays. Low-dose DOX significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in carotenoid (<5 μM)-treatedcells compared to high-dose DOX (>1 μM) or carotenoid (20 μM) treatment alone.Depleted glutathione, increased lipid peroxides and increased ROS levels in cellsconfirmed the cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellgrowth arrest at G0/G1 phase and caspase cascades as well as up- anddown-regulated expression levels of related proteins (p21, p27, Bax, p53, Bcl-2, and cyclin D1) revealed the synergistic effect of carotenoid and DOX treatment onROS-mediated apoptosis. These observations demonstrated increased apoptosis inBC + DOX/LUT + DOX-treated cells due to the pronounced pro-oxidant action.Interestingly, normal breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A) exposed to similartreatments resulted in non-significant cytotoxicity. These newly observedmechanistic differences of anticancer drugs on the mitigation of toxicity withcarotenoids may provide insight into the targeting of cancer therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
