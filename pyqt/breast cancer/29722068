Epub 2018 May 2.Differential ability of formononetin to stimulate proliferation of endothelialcells and breast cancer cells via a feedback loop involving MicroRNA-375, RASD1, and ERα.Chen J(1), Zhang X(1), Wang Y(1), Ye Y(2), Huang Z(3).Author information: (1)School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.(2)Department of Emergency, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi MedicalUniversity, Nanning, China.(3)Department of Pathology, Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.For postmenopausal cardiovascular disease, long-term estrogen therapy mayincrease the risk of breast cancer. To reduce this risk, estrogen may be replacedwith the phytoestrogen formononetin, but how formononetin acts on vascularendothelial cells (ECs) and breast cancer cells is unclear. Here, we show thatlow concentrations of formononetin induced proliferation and inhibited apoptosis more strongly in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) than inbreast cancer cells expressing estrogen receptor α (ERα) (MCF-7, BT474) or not(MDA-MB-231), and that this differential stimulation was associated with miR-375 up-regulation in HUVECs. For the first time, we demonstrate the presence of afeedback loop involving miR-375, ras dexamethasone-induced 1 (RASD1), and ERα in normal HUVECs, and we show that formononetin stimulated this feedback loop inHUVECs but not in MCF-7 or BT474 cells. In all three cell lines, formononetinincreased Akt phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression. Inhibiting miR-375 blockedthese changes and increased proliferation in HUVECs, but not in MCF-7 or BT474cells. In ovariectomized rats, formononetin increased uterine weight and causedsimilar changes in levels of miR-375, RASD1, ERα, and Bcl-2 in aortic ECs as incultured HUVECs. In mice bearing MCF-7 xenografts, tumor growth was stimulated by17β-estradiol but not by formononetin. These results suggest selective action of formononetin in ECs (proliferation stimulation and apoptosis inhibition) relativeto breast cancer cells, possibly via a feedback loop involving miR-375, RASD1,and ERα. This differential effect may explain why formononetin may not increasethe risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/mc.22531 PMID: 29722068
