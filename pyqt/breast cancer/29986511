The mechanism of molecular recognition andinhibition of PD-L1 mAbs is not yet clear, which hinders the subsequent antibody design and modification. In this work, the trajectories of PD-1/PD-L1 andnanobody/PD-L1 complexes were obtained via comparative molecular dynamicssimulations. Then, a series of physicochemical parameters including hydrogenbond, dihedral angle distribution, pKa value and binding free energy, and soforth, were all comparatively analyzed to investigate the recognition difference between PD-L1 and PD-1 and nanobody. Both LR113 (the amino acid residues in PD-L1are represented by the lower left sign of L) and LR125 residues of PD-L1 undergo significant conformational change after association with mAbs, which dominates a strong electrostatic interaction. Solvation effect analysis revealed thatsolvent-water enhanced molecular recognition between PD-L1 and nanobody. Bycombining the analyses of the time-dependent root mean squared fluctuation(RMSF), free energy landscape, clustering and energy decomposition, the potentialinhibition mechanism was proposed that the nanobody competitively andspecifically bound to the &beta;-sheet groups of PD-L1, reduced the PD-L1&rsquo;sflexibility and finally blocked the formation of PD-1/PD-L1 complex. Based on thesimulation results, site-directed mutagenesis of ND99 (the amino acid residues inNano are displayed by the lower left sign of N) and NQ116 in the nanobody may be beneficial for improving antibody activity. This work offers some structuralguidance for the design and modification of anticancer mAbs based on thestructure of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19071984 PMID: 29986511
