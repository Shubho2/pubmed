Electronic address: dyyan@sjtu.edu.cn.Thirty-six of novel compounds2-substituted-1-(2-morpholinoethyl)-1H-naphtho[2,3-d]imidazole-4,9-diones,bearing a N-(2-morpholinoethyl) group and a 2-substituted imidazole segment on a naphthoquinone skeleton, were designed, synthesized and tested as anticanceragents. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in vitro against three human cancer celllines: human breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7), human cervical carcinoma cellline (Hela), and human lung carcinoma cell line (A549); and one normal cell line:mouse fibroblast cell line (L929). Among them, the compound2-(3-chloro-4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(2-morpholinoethyl)-1H-naphtho[2,3-d]imidazole-4,9-dione showed good antiproliferative activity against MCF-7, Hela and A549 (IC50 values are equal to 10.6 μM, 8.3 μM and 4.3 μM respectively) and low cytotoxicityto L929 (IC50 value is equal to 67.3 μM).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
