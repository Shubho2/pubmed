[Epub ahead of print]ALK Fusion Partners Impact Response to ALK Inhibition: Differential Effects onSensitivity, Cellular Phenotypes, and Biochemical Properties.Childress MA(1), Himmelberg SM(2), Chen H(3), Deng W(4), Davies MA(5), LovlyCM(6).Author information: (1)Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University.(2)Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center.(3)Breast Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.(4)Department of Melanoma Medical Oncology, University of Texas MD AndersonCancer Center.(5)Department of Melanoma Medical Oncology, Division of Cancer Medicine, TheUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.(6)Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center christine.lovly@vanderbilt.edu.Oncogenic tyrosine kinase fusions involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are detected in numerous tumor types. Although more than 30 distinct 5' fusionpartners have been reported, treatment of ALK-rearranged cancers is generallydecided without regard to which 5' partner is present. There is little dataaddressing how the 5' partner affects the biology of the fusion or responsivenessto ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Based on the hypothesis that the 5'partner influences the intrinsic properties of the fusion protein, cellularfunctions that impact oncogenic potential, and sensitivity to ALK TKIs; clonal3T3 cell lines stably expressing seven different ALK fusion variants weregenerated. Biochemical and cellular assays were used to assess the efficacy ofvarious ALK TKIs in clinical use, transformative phenotypes, and biochemicalproperties of each fusion. All seven ALK fusions induced focus formation andcolonies in soft agar, albeit to varying degrees. IC50s were calculated fordifferent ALK TKIs (crizotinib, ensartinib, alectinib, and lorlatinib) andconsistent differences (5-10 fold) in drug sensitivity were noted across theseven ALK fusions tested. Finally, biochemical analyses revealed negativecorrelations between kinase activity and protein stability. These resultsdemonstrate that the 5' fusion partner plays an important biological role thataffects sensitivity to ALK TKIs.IMPLICATIONS: This study shows that the 5' ALKfusion partner influences ALK TKI drug sensitivity. As many other kinase fusions are found in numerous cancers, often with overlapping fusion partners, thesestudies have ramifications for other kinase-driven malignancies.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0171 PMID: 30002191
