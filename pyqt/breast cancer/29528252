We used quantile regression models to calculate adjusted median methylation values by estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status.Bivariate associations between participant characteristics and methylation wereexamined.RESULTS: Higher percent methylation of GSTM2 was observed in ER/PR-negativecompared with ER/PR-positive tumors in ductal carcinoma in situ (14 vs 2%) andinvasive (35 vs 3%) tissue components. Trends in aberrant GSTM2 methylationacross tissue components were stronger among ER/PR-negative tumors(p-interaction <0.001). Black women were more likely to have ER/PR-negativetumors (p = 0.01) and show hypermethylation of GSTM2 compared with other women(p = 0.05).CONCLUSION: GSTM2 promoter hypermethylation may serve as a potential biomarker ofaggressive tumor development and a mechanism for ER/PR-negative tumorprogression.DOI: 10.2217/epi-2017-0119 PMCID: PMC5925433 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29528252
