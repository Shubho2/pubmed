Despite the fact that the spontaneous feline mammary carcinoma (FMC) isconsidered a suitable model for breast cancer studies, the importance of theCXCR4/CXCL12 axis in FMC is completely unknown. Therefore, this work aims toelucidate the role of CXCR4 and its ligand in the progression of FMC andmetastatic disease.METHODS: CXCR4 and CXCL12 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry andimmunofluorescence on primary tumors (PT), regional and distant metastases offemale cats with mammary carcinoma and correlated with serum CXCL12 levels, tumormolecular subtypes and clinicopathological features.RESULTS: CXCR4 was more expressed in PT than in metastases (p = 0.0067), whereas CXCL12 was highly expressed in metastatic lesions located in liver and lung(p < 0.0001), as reported for human breast cancer. Moreover, cats with CXCR4positive PT exhibited significantly lower serum CXCL12 levels than cats withCXCR4 negative mammary carcinomas (p = 0.0324). At metastatic lesions,HER2-overexpressing tumors presented higher CXCR4 expression than the othermolecular tumor subtypes (p = 0.012) and significant differences in overall(p = 0.0147) and disease-free survival (p = 0.0279) curves between the cats with CXCL12 positive and CXCL12 negative tumors were found. Indeed, CXCL12 negative PTwere associated with unfavorable prognosis in cats with HER2-overexpressingtumors.CONCLUSIONS: This work exposes part of the complex interaction between CXCR4 and CXCL12 in PT, but also in metastases of a breast cancer model. These findingscould uncover novel therapeutic tools to be used in cats and humans.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4650-9 PMCID: PMC6048851PMID: 30012106
