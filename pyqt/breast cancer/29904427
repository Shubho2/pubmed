China.Interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and transforming growth factor α(TGF-α) have been implicated in the progression of breast cancer. However, thediagnostic and prognostic roles of these cytokines in ductal carcinoma remainunclear. The present study therefore aimed to determine the serum levels ofIL-10, IL-17 and TGF-α in subjects with benign and malignant breast diseases and to evaluate the clinical significance of these cytokines in ductal carcinoma.Pre-operative serum samples were collected from 378 patients with breast disease and 70 healthy subjects. IL-10, IL-17A and TGF-α levels were measured usingELISA. Serum levels of these cytokine in patients with different breast diseases were evaluated. Furthermore, correlations between levels of these cytokines andthe expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in ductal carcinoma were determined.The results demonstrated that serum levels of IL-10 and IL-17A were significantlyincreased in subjects with atypical hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma.Furthermore, IL-10 and IL-17A levels were increased in patients with a moreserious clinical tumor stage and tumors that were ER- and PR-. Furthermore, high serum levels of TGF-α were associated with HER2+ tumors. A strong positivecorrelation was identified between TGF-α and IL-17A levels. Therefore, theresults of the current study revealed that elevated serum IL-10, IL-17A and TGF-αlevels are strongly associated with ductal carcinoma, specifically with tumorstage. High serum levels of IL-10 and IL-17A were also associated with thenegative expression of ER and PR in ductal carcinoma, and high serum levels ofTGF-α were associated with the positive expression of HER2 in ductal carcinoma.Thus, serum cytokine levels may be measured to identify patients with a poorprognosis who may benefit from more aggressive management and treatment.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2018.6109 PMCID: PMC5996718PMID: 29904427
