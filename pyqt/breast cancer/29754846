Two consecutivecohorts of patients who underwent a mastectomy with or without an axillary lymph node dissection were compared. The first cohort was treated conventionally (n =38), the second cohort received GC sponges (n = 39). Endpoints were the incidenceof clinical significant seroma (CSS) and surgical site infections (SSI), the meannumber of aspirations, and the mean aspirated volume.RESULTS: GC sponges lowered the CSS incidence from 73.7% to 38.5% (P = .002). Themean number of aspirations and the mean aspirated volume were not affected. SSIincidence was 15.8% in the conventional cohort compared with 7.7% in the GCcohort (P = .23).CONCLUSION: Application of GC sponges significantly lowered the incidence of CSS.The incidence of SSI was halved, although this was not significant.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
