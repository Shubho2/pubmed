Low-dose aspirin of81 mg or less was a stratification factor. Due to concerns about cardiactoxicity, celecoxib use was stopped in December 2004, while stratification byaspirin use was removed through protocol amendment. We examined the effects ofcelecoxib and low-dose aspirin on event-free survival (EFS), defined as time fromrandom assignment to time of locoregional or distant disease recurrence, newprimary breast cancer, or death from any cause; distant disease-free survival(DDFS); and overall survival (OS). All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: Random assignment to celecoxib (n = 811, 50.0%) or placebo (n = 811,50.0%) was discontinued after 18 months (n = 1622). At a median of 4.1 years'follow-up, among 1622 patients, 186 (11.5%) patients had an EFS event: 80 (4.9%) had distant relapse, and 125 (7.7%) died from any cause. Celecoxib did notstatistically significantly impact EFS, DDFS, or OS in univariate analysis(respectively, P = .92, P = .55, and P = .56) or multivariable analysis(respectively, P = .74, P = .60, and P = .76). Low-dose aspirin use (aspirinusers n = 476, 21.5%; non-aspirin users n = 1733, 78.5%) was associated inunivariate analyses with worse EFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48, 95% confidenceinterval [CI] = 1.12 to 1.96, P = 0.006) and worse OS (HR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.35to 2.61, P < .001). After adjusting for baseline characteristics and treatmentarm, aspirin use showed no statistical association with EFS (P = .08) and DDFS (P= .82), but was associated with statistically worse OS (HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.49, P = .01).Conclusion: Random assignment to short-term (≤18 months) celecoxib as well as useof low-dose aspirin showed no effect on DDFS and EFS in multivariable analysis.Low-dose aspirin increased "all-cause" mortality, presumably because of higherpreexisting cardiovascular risks.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy017 PMID: 29554282
