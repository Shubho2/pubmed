Macrophage traits, exemplified by CD163 expression, in tumor cells areassociated with advanced stages and poor prognosis in breast cancer (BC). Invitro data suggest that cancer cells expressing CD163 acquire radioresistance.METHODS: Tissue microarray was constructed from primary BC obtained from 83patients treated with breast-conserving surgery, 50% having receivedpostoperative radiotherapy (RT) and none of the patients had lymph node ordistant metastasis. Immunostaining of CD163 in cancer cells and macrophageinfiltration (MI) in tumor stroma were evaluated. Macrophage:MCF-7 hybrids weregenerated by spontaneous in vitro cell fusion. After irradiation (0, 2.5 and 5 Gyγ-radiation), both hybrids and their maternal MCF-7 cells were examined byclonogenic survival.RESULTS: CD163-expression by cancer cells was significantly associated with MIand clinicopathological data. Patients with CD163-positive tumors hadsignificantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) after RT. In vitro generatedmacrophage:MCF-7 hybrids developed radioresistance and exhibited better survival and colony forming ability after radiation compared to maternal MCF-7 cancercells.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that macrophage phenotype in tumor cells resultsin radioresistance in breast cancer and shorter DFS after radiotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2646-0 PMCID: PMC6002457PMID: 29725763  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
