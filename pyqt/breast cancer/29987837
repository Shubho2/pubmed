The recommended dose is 3.5 mg/kg, consisting of 2 annual courses, eachcomprising 2 treatment weeks 1 month apart. We reviewed the clinical pharmacologyof Cladribine Tablets in patients with MS, including pharmacokinetic andpharmacometric data. Cladribine Tablets are rapidly absorbed, with a median time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) of 0.5 h (range 0.5-1.5 h) in fastedpatients. When administered with food, absorption is delayed (median Tmax 1.5 h, range 1-3 h), and maximum concentration (Cmax) is reduced by 29% (based ongeometric mean). Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is essentiallyunchanged. Oral bioavailability of cladribine is approximately 40%,pharmacokinetics are linear and time-independent, and volume of distribution is480-490 L. Plasma protein binding is 20%, independent of cladribine plasmaconcentration. Cladribine is rapidly distributed to lymphocytes and retained(either as parent drug or its phosphorylated metabolites), resulting inapproximately 30- to 40-fold intracellular accumulation versus extracellularconcentrations as early as 1 h after cladribine exposure. CytochromeP450-mediated biotransformation of cladribine is of minor importance. Cladribine elimination is equally dependent on renal and non-renal routes. In vitro studies indicate that cladribine efflux is minimally P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-related, andclinically relevant interactions with P-gp inhibitors are not expected.Cladribine distribution across membranes is primarily facilitated byequilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) 1, concentrative nucleosidetransporter (CNT) 3 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and there is no evidence of any cladribine-related effect on heart rate, atrioventricularconduction or cardiac repolarisation (QTc interval prolongation). CladribineTablets are associated with targeted lymphocyte reduction and durable efficacy,with the exposure-effect relationship showing the recommended dose is appropriatein reducing relapse risk.DOI: 10.1007/s40262-018-0695-9 PMID: 29987837
