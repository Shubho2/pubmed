However, the low sensitivity of left ventricularejection fraction limits its use in that preventive strategy. New parameters,such as global longitudinal strain, are being used in the early detection ofcontractile function changes.OBJECTIVES: To assess the incidence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated forbreast cancer, the independent factors associated with that event, and theability of strain to identify it early.METHODS: Prospective observational study of consecutive outpatients diagnosedwith breast cancer, with no previous antineoplastic treatment and no ventricular dysfunction, who underwent anthracycline and/or trastuzumab therapy. The patientswere quarterly evaluated on a 6- to 12-month follow-up by an observer blind totherapy. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association of cardiotoxicitywith clinical, therapeutic and echocardiographic variables. A ROC curve was builtto identify the strain cutoff point on the third month that could predict theejection fraction reduction on the sixth month. For all tests, the statisticalsignificance level adopted was p ≤ 0.05.RESULTS: Of 49 women (mean age, 49.7 ± 12.2 years), cardiotoxicity was identifiedin 5 (10%) on the third (n = 2) and sixth (n = 3) months of follow-up. Strain wasindependently associated with the event (p = 0.004; HR = 2.77; 95%CI: 1.39-5.54),with a cutoff point for absolute value of -16.6 (AUC = 0.95; 95%CI: 0.87-1.0) or a cutoff point for percentage reduction of 14% (AUC = 0.97; 95%CI: 0.9-1.0).CONCLUSION: The 14% reduction in strain (absolute value of -16.6) allowed theearly identification of patients who could develop anthracycline and/ortrastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.DOI: 10.5935/abc.20180021 PMCID: PMC5855907PMID: 29561992
