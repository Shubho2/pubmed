Regarding HepG-2,PC-3, HCT-116 cancer cell lines,7-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(3-methyl-5-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-5-(p-tolyl)-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one (5a) exhibited strong, more potent anticancer(IC50: 0.3, 6.6 and 7 µM) relative to the standard doxorubicin (IC50: 0.6, 6.8and 12.8 µM), respectively. Kinase inhibitory assessment of 5a showed promisinginhibitory activity against three kinases namely PDGFR β, EGFR, and CDK4/cyclinD1 at two concentrations 50 and 100 µM in single measurements. Further, amolecular docking study for compound 5a was performed to verify the binding mode towards the EGFR and CDK4/cyclin D1 kinases.DOI: 10.1080/14756366.2018.1437729 PMCID: PMC6009920PMID: 29482389  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
