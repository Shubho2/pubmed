Its anti-cancerous effect was at first tested in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231breast cell lines, in which MCF7 is well known to be resistant to manyanti-cancer drugs; MCF10A normal breast cell line was used as a control. In vitroexperiments showed that cis-khellactone suppressed cell growth and proliferation at a relatively low concentrations (<5 μg/ml) and decreased cell viability athigh concentrations (>10 μg/ml) in both cancer cell lines in a time- andconcentration-dependent manner. This anti-cancerous effect was also checked inadditional 16 different types of normal and cancer cell lines. Cis-khellactonetreatment significantly suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced cell death in all tested cancer cell lines. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed thatcis-khellactone induced three types of programmed cell death (PCD): apoptosis,autophagy-mediated cell death, and necrosis/necroptosis. Cis-khellactoneconcentration-dependently decreased cell viability by increasing the level ofreactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential(MMP), which are related to all three types of PCD. Mitochondrial fractionationdata revealed that cis-khellactone induced the translocation of BAX and BAK into mitochondria as well as the overexpression of VDAC1, which probably acceleratesMMP disruption and finally cell death. Importantly, our extended in vivo studies with xenograft model further confirmed these findings of anti-cancerous effectsand showed no harmful effects in normal tissues, suggesting that there would beno side effects in humans.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24686 PMCID: PMC5908283PMID: 29682182
