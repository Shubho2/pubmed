The inclusion criteriafor the research were: patients suffering from breast cancer aged between 18 and 70 years, cancer diagnosed by FNB or CORE biopsy. The patients were divided into two groups: patients having breast-conserving surgery and patients having radicalsurgical treatment.Results: There were 47 or 39.37% patients who underwent breast-conserving surgeryand 113 or 70.62% patients who underwent radical surgery. The results of thesurvey conducted show that there was no difference in the quality of life ofpatients before and after surgery, regardless of the type of surgical procedureundertaken. However, there was a significant different in the degree ofdepression between patients subjected to different surgical procedures, where thepatients surveyed post-surgery after radical mastectomy showed a higher degree ofdepression than the patients surveyed after breast-conserving surgery.Conclusion: There is no difference in the quality of life before and aftersurgery, regardless of the type of operation. However, there is a significantdifference in the degree of depression in patients after radical mastectomy, who showed a higher degree of depression than the surveyed patients who underwentbreast-conserving surgery.DOI: 10.5455/medarh.2018.72.202-205 PMCID: PMC6021164PMID: 30061767
