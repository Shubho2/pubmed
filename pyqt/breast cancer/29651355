These tumors are most commonly encountered on the head, neck,and scalp of older women. In rare instances, solitary cylindromas may arise atother body sites. In the current case, a cylindroma of the skin of the breast wasdiagnosed by complete excision. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the tumorcells to be immunoreactive with cytokeratin AE1/3, cytokeratin 5/6, cytokeratin7, p63, and SOX10. The neoplastic cells were also noted to be immunoreactive withmarkers typically expected to be positive in ductal epithelium of the breastincluding GATA3, mammaglobin, and E-cadherin. The case emphasizes the importance of correlating clinical setting, imaging studies, patient history, and carefulmicroscopic evaluation in arriving at an accurate diagnosis. This case alsoillustrates the point that not all "breast" tumors that are confirmed to bepositive for GATA3, mammaglobin, and E-cadherin are derived from mammary ducts.DOI: 10.1155/2018/4039545 PMCID: PMC5831977PMID: 29651355
