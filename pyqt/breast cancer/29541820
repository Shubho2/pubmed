Cytotoxicity of apigenin towards cancer cells was evaluated byMTT assay whereas further genotoxic and oxidative stress parameters were measuredby comet and lipid peroxidation assays, respectively. In order to examine thetype of cell death induced by apigenin, several biomarkers were used.Toxicological safety towards normal cells was evaluated by cell viability andcomet assays. After the treatment with apigenin, we observed changes in cellmorphology in a dose- (10 to 100 μM) and time-dependent manner. Moreover,apigenin caused cell death in both cell lines leading to significant toxicity anddominantly to apoptosis. Furthermore, apigenin proved to be genotoxic towards theselected cancer cells with a potential to induce oxidative damage to lipids. Ofgreat importance is that no significant cytogenotoxic effects were detected innormal cells. The observed cytogenotoxic and pro-cell death activities ofapigenin coupled with its low toxicity towards normal cells indicate that thisnatural product could be used as a future anticancer modality. Therefore, furtheranalysis to determine the exact mechanism of action and in vivo studies on animalmodels are warranted.DOI: 10.1007/s00210-018-1486-4 PMID: 29541820
