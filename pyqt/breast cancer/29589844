Here we determine the physical phenotypes that best distinguishhuman cancer cell lines, and their relationship to cell invasion. We use the highthroughput, single-cell microfluidic method, quantitative deformability cytometry(q-DC), to measure six physical phenotypes including elastic modulus, cellfluidity, transit time, entry time, cell size, and maximum strain at rates of 102cells per second. By training a k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm, wedemonstrate that multiparameter analysis of physical phenotypes enhances theaccuracy of classifying cancer cell lines compared to single parameters alone. Wealso discover a set of four physical phenotypes that predict invasion; usingthese four parameters, we generate the physical phenotype model of invasion bytraining a multiple linear regression model with experimental data from a set of human ovarian cancer cells that overexpress a panel of tumor suppressormicroRNAs. We validate the model by predicting invasion based on measuredphysical phenotypes of breast and ovarian human cancer cell lines that aresubject to genetic or pharmacologic perturbations. Taken together, our resultshighlight how physical phenotypes of single cells provide a biomarker to predict the invasion of cancer cells.DOI: 10.1039/c7ib00222j PMID: 29589844
