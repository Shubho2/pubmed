Women with mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Recent studies show thatshort-wavelength visible light disturb the secretion of melatonin and causescircadian rhythm disruption. We have previously studied the health effects ofexposure to different levels of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs)such as mobile phones, mobile base stations, mobile phone jammers, laptopcomputers, and radars. Moreover, over the past several years, we investigated thehealth effects of exposure to the short wavelength visible light in the blueregion emitted from digital screens. The reduction of melatonin secretion afterexposure to blue light emitted from smartphone's screen has been reported to beassociated with the negative impact of smartphone use at night on sleep. We have shown that both the blue light and RF-EMFs generated by mobile phones are linked to the disruption of the circadian rhythm in people who use their phones atnight. Therefore, if women with hereditary breast cancer predispositions usetheir smartphones, tablets and laptops at night, disrupted circadian rhythms(suppression of melatonin caused by exposure to blue light emitted from thedigital screens), amplifies the risk of breast cancer. It can be concluded thatwomen who carry mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2, or women with family history of breastcancer should avoid using their smartphones, tablets and laptops at night. Using sunglasses with amber lenses, or smartphone applications which decrease theusers' exposure to blue light before sleep, at least to some extent, can decreasethe risk of circadian rhythm disruption and breast cancer.DOI: 10.22038/IJBMS.2018.27711.6751 PMCID: PMC5811748PMID: 29456806
