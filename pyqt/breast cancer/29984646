United States.Influenza viruses are severe human pathogens that pose persistent threat topublic health. Each year more people die of influenza virus infection than thatof breast cancer. Due to the limited efficacy associated with current influenzavaccines, as well as emerging drug resistance from small molecule antiviraldrugs, there is a clear need to develop new antivirals with novel mechanisms ofaction. The influenza virus polymerase complex has become a promising target for the development of the next-generation of antivirals for several reasons.Firstly, the influenza virus polymerase, which forms a heterotrimeric complexthat consists of PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits, is highly conserved. Secondly, bothindividual polymerase subunit (PA, PB1, and PB2) and inter-subunit interactions(PA-PB1, PB1-PB2) represent promising drug targets. Lastly, growing insight into the structure and function of the polymerase complex has spearheaded thestructure-guided design of new polymerase inhibitors. In this review, wehighlight recent progress in drug discovery and assay development targeting theinfluenza virus polymerase complex and discuss their therapeutic potentials.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/0929867325666180706112940 PMID: 29984646
