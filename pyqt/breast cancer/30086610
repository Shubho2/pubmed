Logistic regression analysis revealedpredictive factors of distress at follow-up.Results: At baseline, 53 (46.5%) participants were found to be in the distressgroup. The degree of distress decreased over 1 year (p= 0.003); however, 43(37.7%) showed significant remaining distress at follow-up. Baseline scores ofthe ECR-M36 avoidance [odds ratio (OR)=1.045, 95% confidence interval(CI)=1.002-1.090] and HADS-total (OR=1.138, 95% CI=1.043-1.241) were predictorsof distress at follow-up.Conclusion: A substantial proportion of early BC patients suffer distress evenone-year after surgery. Avoidant attachment appeared to be an influential factor on distress in early BC patients. Moreover, the finding that initial distresslevel could predict one at 1-year postoperation warrant a screening andmanagement of distress along with BC treatment.DOI: 10.30773/pi.2018.06.07 PMID: 30086610
