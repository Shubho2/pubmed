However, the influence of pre-αPEG Abs on the pharmacokinetics (PK) andtherapeutic efficacy of LipoDox is unknown. Methods: We generated two pre-αPEG Abmouse models. First, naïve mice were immunized with PEGylated protein to generatean endogenous αPEG Ab titer (endo αPEG). Second, monoclonal αPEG Abs werepassively transferred (αPEG-PT) into naïve mice to establish a αPEG titer. Thenaïve, endo αPEG and αPEG-PT mice were intravenously injected with 111in-labeled LipoDox to evaluate its PK. Tumor-bearing naïve, endo αPEG and αPEG-PT mice were intravenously injected with 111in-labeled LipoDox to evaluate itsbiodistribution. The therapeutic efficacy of LipoDox was estimated in thetumor-bearing mice. Results: The areas under the curve (AUC)last of LipoDox inendo αPEG and αPEG-PT mice were 11.5- and 15.6- fold less, respectively, thanthat of the naïve group. The biodistribution results suggested that pre-αPEG Abcan significantly reduce tumor accumulation and accelerate blood clearance of111In-labeled LipoDox from the spleen. The tumor volumes of the tumor-bearingendo αPEG and αPEG-PT mice after treatment with LipoDox were significantlyincreased as compared with that of the tumor-bearing naïve mice. Conclusions:Pre-αPEG Abs were found to dramatically alter the PK and reduce the tumoraccumulation and therapeutic efficacy of LipoDox. Pre-αPEG may have potential as a marker to aid development of personalized therapy using LipoDox and achieveoptimal therapeutic efficacy.DOI: 10.7150/thno.22164 PMCID: PMC5996368PMID: 29896310
