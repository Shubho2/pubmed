[Epub ahead of print]Epidermal growth factor receptor based active targeting: a paradigm shift towardsadvance tumor therapy.Habban Akhter M(1)(2), Sateesh Madhav N(1), Ahmad J(3).Author information: (1)a Faculty of Pharmacy , DIT University , Dehradun , India.(2)b School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research , Jamia Hamdard , New Delhi , India.(3)c Department of Pharmaceutics , Najran University , Najran , Saudi Arabia.The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface receptor belonging to erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homologue (ErbB) family of tyrosinekinase. It plays critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. The EGFR receptor is crucial in a variety of tumordevelopment due to unlikely triggered by receptor overexpression, chromosomalmutation and or ligand-dependent receptor dimerization. The EGFR inhibitionestablished a major therapeutic target in cancer therapy. The signal transductionpathway of EGFR is directly involved in tumor pathogenesis and progression. Thecombinatorial approach with EGFR inhibitors bring novel therapeutic regime withproved clinical efficacy. This critique briefly addressed EGFR receptorcharacteristics, worldwide report on various cancers and EGFR based potentialtargeting modalities in skin, breast, ovary, brain, lungs, pancreas, gastric and colorectal tumors and molecular pathways involved in EGFR targeting.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1481863 PMID: 29991287
