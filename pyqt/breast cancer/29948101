Nowadays, a combination of a local flap for nipple reconstruction and skin grafting or tattooing for areolareconstruction is deemed a first choice. In this paper, we are combining thetechniques of local flap and full-thickness skin graft from the upper inner thighfor simultaneous reconstruction of the nipple and areola.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January, 2016 to December, 2017, 23 female patientswith an absent unilateral nipple-areolar complex due to post-oncologicalmastectomy and immediate implant-based breast reconstruction were subjects of thestudy. On an out-patient clinic basis, the percentage of the nipple projectionloss was calculated at the intervals of 3 , 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Atthe final visit, the patient's subjective satisfaction on the reconstructedareola compared to the normal contralateral side was evaluated using a visualanalogue scale.RESULTS: Over the course of time, the mean nipple projection loss was20.16 ± 12.88, 31.78 ± 11.63 and 34.69 ± 12.01% at 3 , 6 and 12 monthspostoperatively, respectively. Patients' overall satisfaction on the graftedareola was as follows; the largest number of patients (8 patients) had a 'good'satisfaction 12-months postoperatively. Out of 21 patients, those who considered the result to be 'poor' and 'disappointing' each accounted for 1 and 3 patients.CONCLUSION: The combination of nipple-areolar complex reconstruction techniqueintroduced in this study has proven to be a safe and efficacious alternative inpatients with implant-based reconstruction requiring small- to medium-sizednipple projection, especially when the skin envelope is too tight for a localflap only.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level ofevidence to each article.
