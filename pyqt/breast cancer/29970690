Beside other biochemical parameters, participants'serum PON and ARE levels were determined and analyzed.Results: Serum PON and ARE levels were found decreased in sera of the patients(96.44 ± 21 and 159.75 ± 15.75 U/L, respectively)compared to controls (158.39 ±23.04 and 239.33 ± 32.98 U/L, respectively) (P = 0.001 for both). Subgroupanalysis of the BC patients revealed that both serum PON and ARE levels werelower in patients who needed neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), compared to thosewho did not (P = 0.024 and 0.02, respectively). We determined a cut-off value of PON according to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis as 131.2U/L (sensitivity 97.5% and specificity 93.9%).Conclusion: BC patients have lower serum PON and ARE levels than healthycontrols. Also, serum ARE levels (but not PON) were negatively correlated withbody mass index in BC patients. Both serum PON and ARE levels were lower inpatients who needed NAC than in patients who did not need such therapy.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.235355 PMID: 29970690
