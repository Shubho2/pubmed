The aim of thepresent study is to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumoreffect of silencing ClC-3 in breast cancer.Methods: Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were used in theexperiments. Messenger RNA and protein expression were examined by quantitativereal-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Cell proliferationwas measured by the bromodeoxyuridine method, and the cell cycle was evaluatedusing fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Protein interaction in cells wasanalyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. Tumor tissues were stained withhematoxylin-eosin and tumor burden was measured using the Metamorph software.Results: Breast cancer tissues collected from patients showed an increase inClC-3 expression. Knockdown of ClC-3 inhibited the secretion of insulin-likegrowth factor (IGF)-1, cell proliferation, and G1/S transition in breast cancercells. In the mouse xenograft model of human breast carcinoma, tumor growth wassignificantly slower in animals injected with ClC-3-deficient cells compared withthe growth of normal human breast cancer cells. In addition, silencing of ClC-3attenuated the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Ki-67, cyclinD1, and cyclin E, as well as the activation of extracellular signalregulatedprotein kinases (ERK) 1/2, both in vitro and in vivo.Conclusion: Together, our data suggest that upregulation of ClC-3 by IGF-1contributes to cell proliferation and tumor growth in breast cancer, and ClC-3deficiency suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth via the IGF/IGFreceptor/ERK pathway.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.103 PMCID: PMC6015970PMID: 29963105
