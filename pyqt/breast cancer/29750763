The objectiveof this study was to analyze the effect of tamoxifen, a medication commonlyprescribed for patients with breast cancer, as a possible alternative to reducethe rate of autologous fat graft resorption.METHODS: The fatty cushion of the inguinal region of 20 female adult Wistar rats was removed and then autografted, using a standard volume of 0.2 ml in thesubfascial plane of the dorsal region. The subject animals were randomized intotwo groups, the control and study groups. The study group animals wereadministered 20 mg/kg/day of tamoxifen citrate over a period of 21 days, by meansof gavage. At the end of the experiment, the animals were killed and the graftsunderwent morphologic and histopathologic analysis, with emphasis on thepredominant inflammatory response pattern and collagen maturation.RESULTS: The rats undergoing treatment with tamoxifen (study group) presentedhigher values in relation to the weight and volume of fat grafts compared withthe initial values and the control group. Histologic analysis using hematoxylinand eosin staining showed that resolution of the inflammatory process was faster in the control group. Analysis using the picrosirius method demonstrated higherpercentages of immature collagen versus mature collagen.CONCLUSION: Use of tamoxifen reduced the rates of resorption and fibrosis of the injected fat, resulting in better integration of the autologous fat graft.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004415 PMID: 29750763
