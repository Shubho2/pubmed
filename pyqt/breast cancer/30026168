By solid-phase synthesis, weprepared temporin-SHa and several temporin-SHa analogs with one or more D-alanineresidues incorporated. The natural product and the analog [G10a]SHa were found tobe cytotoxic in mammalian cell lines and induce cell death. To achieveselectivity, we conjugated the analog [G10a]SHa with a breast cancer targetingpeptide (BCTP). The resulting peptide temporin [G10a]SHa-BCTP conjugate wasselectively active against the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line with no cytotoxicityin NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Unlike the natural product or [G10a]SHa, the conjugatedpeptide induced apoptosis, downregulating the expression of Bcl-2 and survivinand upregulating Bax and caspase-3.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
