Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University,Chicago, IL USA.Metastasis accounts for 90% of breast cancer mortality. Despite the significantprogress made over the past decade in cancer medicine our understanding ofmetastasis remains limited, therefore preventing and targeting metastasis is not yet possible. Breast cancer cells preferentially metastasize to specific organs, known as "organotropic metastasis", which is regulated by subtypes of breastcancer, host organ microenvironment, and cancer cells-organ interactions. Thecross-talk between cancer cells and host organs facilitates the formation of the premetastatic niche and is augmented by factors released from cancer cells prior to the cancer cells' arrival at the host organ. Moreover, host microenvironmentand specific organ structure influence metastatic niche formation andinteractions between cancer cells and local resident cells, regulating thesurvival of cancer cells and formation of metastatic lesions. Understanding themolecular mechanisms of organotropic metastasis is essential for biomarker-based prediction and prognosis, development of innovative therapeutic strategy, andeventual improvement of patient outcomes. In this review, we summarize themolecular mechanisms of breast cancer organotropic metastasis by focusing ontumor cell molecular alterations, stemness features, and cross-talk with the hostenvironment. In addition, we also update some new progresses on our understandingabout genetic and epigenetic alterations, exosomes, microRNAs, circulating tumor cells and immune response in breast cancer organotropic metastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41698-018-0047-0 PMCID: PMC5871901PMID: 29872722
