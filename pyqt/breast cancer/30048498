This study explores thecontribution of anthropometric and reproductive factors in UK females developing BC in a large longitudinal cohort.METHODS: Data from the UK Biobank prospective study of 273,467 UK females wereanalyzed. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each factorwere adjusted for age, family history of BC and deprivation score. The analyseswere stratified by the menopausal status.RESULTS: Over the 9 years of follow up the total number of BC cases were 14,231with 3,378 (23.7%) incident cases with an incidence rate of 2.09 per 1000person-years. In pre-menopausal, increase in age, height, having low BMI, lowwaist to hip ratio, first degree family history of BC, early menarche age,nulliparous, late age at first live birth, high reproductive interval index, and long contraceptive use duration were all significantly associated with anincreased BC risk. In post-menopausal, getting older, being taller, having highBMI, first degree BC family history, nulliparous, late age at first live birth,and high reproductive interval index were all significantly associated with anincreased risk of BC. The population attributable fraction (PAF) suggested thatan early first live birth, lower reproductive interval index and increased numberof children can contribute to BC risk reduction up to 50%.CONCLUSIONS: This study utilizes the UK Biobank study to confirm associationsbetween anthropometric and reproductive factors and the risk of breast cancerdevelopment. Result of attributable fraction of risk contributed by each riskfactor suggested that lifetime risk of BC can be reduced by controlling weight,reassessing individual approaches to the timing of childbirth and options forcontraception and considering early screening for women with family history inthe first degree relative.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201097 PMCID: PMC6062099PMID: 30048498
