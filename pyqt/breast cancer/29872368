Epub 2017 Dec 26.A case of radiation-induced bullous morphea/lichen sclerosus overlap in a breast cancer patient.Petersen E(1), Yazdani L(2), Hymes SR(3).Author information: (1)McGovern Medical School, Department of Dermatology, Houston, TX, UnitedStates.(2)McGovern Medical School, Houston, TX, United States.(3)Department of Dermatology, Division of Internal Medicine, The University ofTexas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.Radiation induced morphea (RIM) is an increasingly common complication ofradiation treatment for malignancy as early detection has made more patientseligible for non-surgical treatment options. In many cases, the radiationoncologist is the first person to learn of the initial skin changes, often monthsbefore a dermatologist sees them. In this paper we present a breast cancerpatient who developed a rare bullous variant of RIM, which delayed her diagnosis and subsequent treatment. It is imperative to diagnose RIM early as it carriessignificant morbidity and permanent deformity if left untreated. The lesionstypically present within 1 year of radiation therapy and extend beyond theradiated field. RIM is often mistaken for radiation dermatitis or cellulitis.Bullae, when present, are often hemorrhagic in appearance, which can serve asanother clinical clue. It is important to refer these patients for a fullgynecologic exam as there can be concurrent anogenital lichen sclerosus etatrophicus which is both debilitating and carries a long term risk for squamouscell carcinoma. Treatment with systemic agents is often necessary, and can bemanaged by a dermatologist. The most proven regimen in the literature appears to be methotrexate, with our without concurrent narrow band UVB phototherapy.DOI: 10.1016/j.rpor.2017.11.004 PMCID: PMC5986578 [Available on 2019-01-01]PMID: 29872368
