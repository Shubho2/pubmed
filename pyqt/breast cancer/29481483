Patient ages ranged from 31 to 73 years, with a mean (SD) of 52.81(9.89) years. Ischemia time ranged from 17 to 211 minutes (mean [SD], 51.51[23.02] minutes), and procedure length (including mastectomy time) was between224 and 950 minutes (mean [SD], 548.13 [154.77] minutes). Venous coupler size wasbetween 2 and 4 mm (mean [SD], 2.69 [0.33] mm), and 1 to 3 perforating vesselswere maintained per flap (mean [SD], 1.71 [0.68] perforators). Totalreexploration rate was 3.3% (n = 9), and the total complete flap loss rate was1.1% (n = 3).CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the DIEP flap is a safe, consistent, and reliableoption for breast reconstruction.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001341 PMID: 29481483
