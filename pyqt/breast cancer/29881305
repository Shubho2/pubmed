Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.Results: The results on the 486 patients recorded in the TCGA indicated that highMUC1 expression was independently related to BRAF mutation, lymph node metastasis(LNM), and unifocal type. In the 69 fine-needle aspiration biopsy patients withPTC, high MUC1 expression was significantly related to LNM and extrathyroidextension (ETE). The result of Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that BRAFmutation and MUC1 expression were moderately correlated. Moreover, in thesubgroup with low MUC1 expression, the patients with BRAF mutation had higher ETEfrequency and LNM than those without BRAF mutation. In the subgroup with BRAFmutation, patients with high MUC1 expression exhibited higher ETE frequency than those with low MUC1 expression, and high MUC1 expression occurred in olderpatients. In the subgroup with BRAF wild-type mutation, patients with high MUC1expression had a higher incidence of ETE and LNM than those with low expression.Conclusion: We demonstrated that the MUC1 is an important oncogene in PTC and mayhave great significance on therapeutic cancer vaccine development.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S161501 PMCID: PMC5985787PMID: 29881305
