Electronic address:emittendorf@bwh.harvard.edu.The American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system has evolved in response to improved imaging, refined surgical techniques, enhanced pathologic evaluation,and greater understanding of tumor biology. The 8th edition has introducedclinical and pathologic prognostic stages for breast cancer that incorporatebiologic variables (grade, estrogen/progesterone receptor status, HER2 status,multigene panels) with TNM categories that define the anatomic stage. Theprognostic staging system facilitates more refined stratification than theanatomic stage with respect to survival and is an important advance thatmaintains the clinical relevance of the staging system by taking into accounttumor biology and current treatment algorithms.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
