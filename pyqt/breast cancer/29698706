Treating DCIS by deliveringdrugs locally to the affected milk duct offers significant advantages oversystemic administration, including reduced systemic and breast toxicities, aswell as a greatly reduced need for surgery and radiation. In this study, mammary gland retention and toxicity of intraductally administered poly(ethylene)glycol-doxorubicin (PEG-DOX) polymeric conjugate nanocarriers of varyingmolecular sizes and architectures were investigated. Nanocarriers were formed by conjugating one or more copies of doxorubicin to PEG polymers, of varyingmolecular weights (5, 10, 20, and 40 kDa) and architectures (linear, four-arm andeight-arm). Cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells, a human breast cancer cell line, wasassessed, and IC50 values were calculated. The nanocarriers were intraductallyadministered into the mammary glands of female retired breeder Sprague-Dawleyrats. Whole body images were captured using in vivo optical imaging, and changes in ductal structure as well local inflammation were monitored. Fluorescenceintensities were monitored, over time, to evaluate nanocarrier mammary glandretention half-lives (t1/2). The IC50 values of PEG-DOX nanocarriers against MCF7cells were 40 kDa PEG-(DOX)4 (1.23 μM) < 5 kDa PEG-DOX (1.76 μM) < 40 kDaPEG-(DOX)8 (3.49 μM) < 10 kDa PEG-DOX (3.86 μM) < 20 kDa PEG-DOX(8.96 μM) < 40 kDa PEG-DOX (18.11 μM), whereas the IC50 of free DOX was only0.14 μM. The t1/2 of linear 5, 20, and 40 kDa nanocarriers were 2.2 ± 0.3,3.6 ± 0.6, and 13.1 ± 3.4 h, whereas the retention t1/2 of 4- and 8-arm 40 kDananocarriers were 14.9 ± 5.6 h and 11.9 ± 2.9 h, respectively. The retention t1/2of free doxorubicin was 2.0 ± 0.4 h, which was significantly shorter than that ofthe linear and branched 40 kDa PEG-DOX nanocarriers. Increased molecular weightand decreased branching both demonstrated a strong correlation to enhancedmammary gland retention. Intraductally administered free doxorubicin resulted in ductal damage, severe inflammation and generation of atypical cell neoplasms,whereas PEG-DOX nanocarriers induced only minor and transient inflammation (i.e.,damaged epithelial cells and detached cellular debris). The 40 kDa 4-arm PEG-DOX nanocarrier demonstrated the longest ductal retention half-life, the lowest IC50 (i.e., most potent), and minimal ductal damage and inflammation. The currentresults suggest that PEG-DOX nanocarriers with prolonged ductal retention maypresent the best option for intraductal treatment of DCIS, due to their low localtoxicity and potential for sustained therapeutic effect.Copyright © 2018.
