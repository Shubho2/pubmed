After routine breast ultrasound examinations, the patientsunderwent ARFI elasticity imaging. Virtual Touch tissue imaging (VTI) and VirtualTouch tissue quantification (Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, CA) wereused to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the elasticity and hardness oftumors. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed toevaluate the diagnostic performance of ARFI for discrimination between benign andmalignant breast lesions.RESULTS: Pathologic analysis revealed 40 lesions in the malignant group and 86lesions in the benign group. Different VTI patterns were observed in benign andmalignant breast lesions. Eighty lesions (93.0%) of benign group had pattern 1,2, or 3, whereas all pattern 4b lesions (n = 20 [50.0%]) were malignant.Regarding the quantitative analysis, the mean VTI-to-B-mode area ratio, internal shear wave velocity, and marginal shear wave velocity of benign lesions werestatistically significantly lower than those of malignant lesions (all P < .001).The cutoff point for a scoring system constructed to evaluate the diagnosticperformance of ARFI was estimated to be between 3 and 4 points for malignancy,with sensitivity of 77.5%, specificity of 96.5%, accuracy of 90.5%, and an areaunder the curve of 0.933.CONCLUSIONS: The application of ARFI technology has shown promising results bynoninvasively providing substantial complementary information and couldpotentially serve as an effective diagnostic tool for differentiation betweenbenign and malignant breast lesions.© 2018 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/jum.14599 PMID: 29656388
