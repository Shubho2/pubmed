Precision will be achieved at each phase of care, fromdetection to diagnosis to surgery, systemic therapy, and radiation therapy, tosurvivorship and follow-up care. The precision arises from detailed knowledge of the inherent biological propensities of each tumor, rather than generalizingtreatment approaches based on phenotypic, or even genotypic, categories.Extensive research is being conducted in multiple disciplines, includingradiology, pathology, molecular biology, and surgical, medical, and radiationoncology. Clinical trial design is adapting to the new paradigms and moving away from grouping heterogeneous patient populations into limited treatment comparisonarms. This review touches on several areas invested in clinical research. Thisspecial issue highlights the specific work of a number of groups working onprecision medicine for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/4809183 PMCID: PMC5971283PMID: 29862084
