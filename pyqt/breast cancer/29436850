[Epub ahead ofprint]Mammography cancer detection: comparison of single 8MP and pair of 5MP reporting monitors.Strudley CJ(1), Young KC(1)(2), Warren LM(1).Author information: (1)1 National Co-ordinating Centre for the Physics of Mammography, Royal SurreyCounty Hospital NHS Foundation Trust , Guildford , UK.(2)2 Department of Physics, University of Surrey , Guildford , UK.OBJECTIVE: To compare breast cancer detection using a single 8MP display withusing a standard pair of 5MP monitors.METHODS: An observer study was carried out in which mammograms were read usingfull field views only, and again with the additional use of magnified quadrantviews. Seven observers read 300 cases, one view per breast, using each displaytype. Cases comprised 100 normal cases and 200 cases with cancers of subtle orvery subtle appearance: 100 with malignant calcification clusters and 100 withnon-calcified lesions. JAFROC software was used to analyse the results.RESULTS: When mammograms were viewed full field only, observers performed better (p = 0.050) in detecting malignant calcification clusters when using the pair of 5MP monitors compared with a single 8MP monitor. This result becamenon-significant when results were generalised to a population of readers.Performance in detecting calcification clusters was improved by using quadrantview in addition to full field view when using either the pair of 5MP monitors orthe 8MP monitor. There was no significant difference in detection of all types ofcancer between the pair of 5MP monitors and the 8MP monitor when quadrant zoomwas used.CONCLUSION: Providing quadrant view is used in addition to full field view, thereis no significant difference in cancer detection between the 8MP monitor and the pair of 5MP monitors.
