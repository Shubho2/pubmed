BC is a systemic disease with a highly heterogeneous course ofdisease. Therefore, prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers are required to improve the clinical risk management. Cancer-derived or cancer-associated extracellularvesicles (EVs) procured from the bloodstream of BC patients offer a novelplatform for the qualitative and quantitative screening and establishment ofbiomarkers. Here, we focus on common aspects of EVs, on the function ofBC-derived EVs and their translational potential considering the EV abundancy,intravesicular as well as outer membrane-anchored composition and currentchallenges of implementation in clinical practice.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00584 PMCID: PMC5879062PMID: 29632535
