These diseases are oftenmetastasizing cancers (like multiple myeloma, breast cancer and prostate cancer(Aragon-Ching et al., 2009)) as well as osteoporosis. BRONJ is incompletelyunderstood, although it is believed to arise from a defect in bone remodeling-theintricate process by which sensory osteocytes signal to osteoclasts andosteoblasts to resorb and form bone in response to stimuli. Further, toothextraction and infection have been overwhelmingly linked to BRONJ (Ikebe, 2013). Because bone cells are highly networked, the importance of multicellularinteractions and mechanotransduction during the onset of these risk factorscannot be overstated. As such, this perspective addresses current research on theeffects of BPs, mechanical load and inflammation on bone remodeling and ondevelopment of BRONJ. Our investigation has led us to conclude that improved invitro systems capable of adequately recapitulating multicellular communicationand incorporating effects of osteocyte mechanosensing on bone resorption andformation are needed to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which BRONJ ensues.DOI: 10.1016/j.bonr.2018.03.003 PMCID: PMC6020112PMID: 29955628
