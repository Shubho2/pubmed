Correlation coefficients were calculated between number of unmetsupportive care needs (per Supportive Care Needs Survey), HRQOL (per SF-36), and sociodemographic variables.RESULTS: Unmet supportive care needs were correlated with lower HRQOL in alldomains (r > -0.40; p < 0.0001). Lower income was significantly associated withlower HRQOL (r > 0.21; p < 0.05) and more supportive care needs (r = -0.22;p < 0.05). Multimorbidity was significantly associated with decreased HRQOL(r > -0.23; p < 0.05) and greater supportive care need (r = 0.19; p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Identifying and addressing unmet supportive care needs may improveHRQOL in low-income Latina breast cancer survivors. Rehabilitation interventions that address barriers to accessing supportive care related to low SES andmultimorbidity may also improve health outcomes in this population. The dualeffect of multimorbidity on both quality of life and level of supportive careneed in this population warrants further investigation. Implications forrehabilitation Screening for unmet supportive care needs may be an important stepin improving health-related quality of life during cancer rehabilitation.Challenges accompanying multimorbidity and lower socioeconomic status may preventlow-income cancer patients from accessing adequate supportive care.Rehabilitation interventions for socioeconomically disadvantaged cancer survivorsshould compensate for both socioeconomic status and the presence of comorbiditiesin order to reduce disparities in quality of life during survivorship.DOI: 10.1080/09638288.2018.1485179 PMID: 30052478
