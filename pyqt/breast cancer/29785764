[Epub ahead of print]The Effect of the 2009 USPSTF breast cancer screening recommendations on breastcancer in Michigan: A longitudinal study.Caughran J(1), Braun TM(2), Breslin TM(3), Smith DR(4), Kreinbrink JL(4), Parish GK(4), Davis AT(4), Bacon-Baguley TA(4), Silver SM(2), Henry NL(5).Author information: (1)Comprehensive Breast Center, Mercy Health Saint Mary's, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.(2)Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.(3)Comprehensive Breast Program, Mercy Health St. Joseph, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.(4)Physician Assistant Studies, Grand Valley State University, Allendale, MI,USA.(5)Division of Oncology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.In 2009, the revised United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)guidelines recommended against routine screening mammography for women age40-49 years and against teaching self-breast examinations (SBE). The aim of this study was to analyze whether breast cancer method of presentation changedfollowing the 2009 USPSTF screening recommendations in a large Michigan cohort.Data were collected on women with newly diagnosed stage 0-III breast cancerparticipating in the Michigan Breast Oncology Quality Initiative (MiBOQI)registry at 25 statewide institutions from 2006 to 2015. Data included method of detection, cancer stage, treatment type, and patient demographics. In all, 30 008women with breast cancer detected via mammogram or palpation with an average age of 60.1 years were included. 38% of invasive cancers were identified bypalpation. Presentation with palpable findings decreased slightly over time, from34.6% in 2006 to 28.9% in 2015 (P < .001). Over the 9-year period, there was nostatistically significant change in rate of palpation-detected tumors for womenage <50 years or ≥50 years (P = .27, .30, respectively). Younger women were more likely to present with palpable tumors compared to older women in a statewideregistry. This rate did not increase following publication of the 2009 USPSTFbreast cancer screening recommendations.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13034 PMID: 29785764
