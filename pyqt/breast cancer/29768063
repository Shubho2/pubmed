However, the effects of the HOX gene onglioblastoma (GBM) remain poorly understood. We examined HOXC10 expression in GBMtissues and cells, analysed its effect on GBM prognosis, and finally assessed itspossible underlying mechanisms in this study.METHODS: HOXC10 expression levels and its prognostic effects on GBM tissues were analysed based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and ONCOMINE database. Overallsurvival (OS) analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log ranktest. Then, the expression of HOXC10 was detected in four GBM cell lines usingquantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, smallinterfering RNA (si-RNA) was utilised in the U87 cell line with the highestHOXC10 expression to facilitate subsequent in vitro cell experiment. Cellproliferation, migration and invasion were assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8(CCK-8) and colony formation assay, wound healing, Transwell assay, respectively in GBM U87 cell after HOXC10 knockdown. Key proteins related to thephosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathwaywere measured by western blotting.RESULTS: HOXC10 expression was significantly increased in GBM tissues and celllines, leading a poor OS in GBM patients. Knockdown of HOXC10 could inhibit theGBM U87 cells proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as decreasedexpression levels of key proteins in PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.CONCLUSION: HOXC10 was overexpressed in GBM tissues and cells, and associatedwith poor prognosis in GBM patients. Moreover, HOXC10 knockdown inhibited U87cell proliferation, migration and invasion, which were potentially related toPI3K/AKT signalling pathway activation. Our findings revealed that HOXC10represent a promising biological target for GBM treatment in the future.DOI: 10.1080/1061186X.2018.1473408 PMID: 29768063
