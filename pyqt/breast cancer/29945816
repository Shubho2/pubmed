So we should explore the relevance between molecular subtypes andefficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer as well as its prognosticfactors, which about survival analysis and disease free survival involved, which was one part of contributing for evaluating in terms of global survival anddisease free survival.METHODS: Medical records of 264 patients with breast cancer who receivedneoadjuvant chemotherapy in Breast Center, the Fourth Hospital of Hebei MedicalUniversity, between January 2008 and May 2013. The relationship between molecularsubtypes and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and clinical pathological features wereanalyzed.RESULTS: The total pCR rate was 12.50% (33/264). The rate of pCR were 3.03%(1/33), 9.40% (14/149), 17.39%(8/46), 27.78% (10/36) in Luminal A type, Luminal Btype, HER2 overexpression type, and Triple negative type, respectively. Which waspredicted that The pCR rate associated with breast cancer molecular subtypes(P < 0.05). The pCR rate in Triple negative type was highest, HER2 overexpressiontype was showed higher pCR rate than Luminal A and Luminal B type. Multiplefactors analysis results showed that: the independent impact factors of 5-yearoverall survival rate in neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer patients wereclinical stage, tumor size, chemotherapy regimens, lymph node metastasis,estrogen receptor status and pathological remission; the independent impactfactors of 5-year disease free survival rate were tumor size, chemotherapyregimens, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status and pathologicalremission (P < 0.05). Triple negative type of breast cancer had shorter overallsurvival and disease-free survival (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The pCR was more frequently observed in HER2 overexpression type andTriple negative type of breast cancer. That could achieve a higher rate of pCR onpaclitaxel class joint anthracycline-based chemotherapy. But Triple negative typeshowed worse prognosis, due to residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy,which could be in combination or sequential, at the neoadjuvant / adjuvantsetting (NCCN 2016 Breast cancer, chemotherapy regimens), So how to choose a moreappropriate neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens, we should need further research.Copyright © 2018.
