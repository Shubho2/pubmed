Still, many patients are nonadherent dueto adverse side effects. We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to testthe use of a web-based application (app) designed with and without weeklyreminders for patients to report real-time symptoms and AI use outside of clinic visits with built-in alerts to patients' oncology providers. Our goal was toimprove symptom burden and medication adherence.METHODS: Forty-four women with early-stage breast cancer and a new AIprescription were randomized to either an App+Reminder (weekly reminders to useapp) or an App (no reminders) group. Pre- and post-assessment data were collectedfrom all participants.RESULTS: Participants in the App+Reminder group had higher weekly app usage rate (74 vs. 38%, p < 0.05) during the intervention and reported higher AI adherenceat 8 weeks (100 vs. 72%, p < 0.05). Symptom burden increase was higher for theApp group compared to the App+Reminder group but did not reach statisticalsignificance.CONCLUSIONS: Weekly reminders to use a web-based app to report AI adherence andtreatment-related symptoms demonstrated feasibility and improved short-term AIadherence, which may reduce symptom burden for women with breast cancer and a newAI prescription.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: If short-term gains in adherence persist, thislow-cost intervention could improve survival outcomes for women with breastcancer. A larger, long-term study should examine if AI adherence and symptomburden improvements persist for a 5-year treatment period.DOI: 10.1007/s11764-018-0682-z PMCID: PMC6054536 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29492753
