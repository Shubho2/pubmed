Traditional 3Dassays such as the Boyden Chamber require that cells are displaced from theoriginal culture location and moved to a new environment. Not only does thisdisrupt the cellular processes that are intrinsic to the microenvironment, but itoften results in a loss of cells. These problems are especially challenging when dealing with cells that are either rare, or extremely sensitive to theirmicroenvironment. Here, we describe the development of a 3D invasion assay thatavoids both concerns. In this assay, cells are plated within a small well and an ECM matrix containing a chemoattractant is laid atop the cells. This requires no cell displacement, and allows the cells to invade upwards into the matrix. Inthis assay, cell invasion as well as cell morphology can be assessed within thecollagen gel. Using this assay, we characterize the invasive capacity of rare andsensitive cells; the hybrid cells resulting from fusion between breast cancercells MCF7 and mesenchymal/multipotent stem/stroma cells (MSCs).DOI: 10.3791/56568 PMID: 29578529  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
