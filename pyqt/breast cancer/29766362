AQ After 2-3 years ofadjuvant tamoxifen, AQpatients were randomized between the schemes ofcontinuation for 5 years on tamoxifen and switching to exemestane. The numbers ofCD8-positive TILs were analysed for correlations with disease-free survival (DFS)and overall survival (OS). A similar analysis was performed on 2596 patients inthe TEAM trial who were randomized between the sequential scheme and theexemestane monotherapy.RESULTS: In the first cohort, patients with low (below median) numbers ofCD8-positive TILs had a univariate hazard ratio (HR) for DFS of 0.27 (95% CI0.13-0.55) in favour of treatment with exemestane, whereas this benefit was notobserved in patients with high numbers of CD8-positive TILs (HR 1.34, 95% CI0.71-2.50, HR for interaction 5.02, p = 0.001). In the second cohort, patientswith low numbers of CD8-positive TILs showed a benefit of exemestane treatment onrecurrence-free survival (RFS HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45-0.99), and not withabove-median numbers of CD8-positive TILs (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.59-1.26, HR forinteraction 1.29, p = 0.36).CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to propose the number of CD8-positive TILsas potential predictive markers for endocrine therapy, with the low presence ofCD8-positive TILs associated to benefit for exemestane-inclusive therapy.However, treatment-by-marker interactions were only significant in one cohort,indicating the need for further validation.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4785-z PMID: 29766362
