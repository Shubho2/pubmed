The efficacy and safety analysis wasperformed in 82 patients who had received at least one dose of palbociclib andwho had at least 6-month follow-up at the data cut-off point. The primaryobjective was the evaluation of efficacy of the combination of palbociclib andendocrine therapy with clinical benefit as primary endpoint, defined as theabsence of progressive disease and being on treatment for at least 6 months.Secondary objectives were the evaluation of toxicity and the identification ofpotential predictors for clinical benefit.RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 67.1 years (range 34.8-85.9) at thetime of inclusion. The average duration of treatment was 5.6 months (range 1-19),with a median progression-free survival of 3.17 (95% CI 2.76-4.70) months. At thedata cut-off point, 10 patients were still on treatment with palbociclib. In thishighly pretreated setting, 34 patients experienced no progressive disease within 6 months, resulting in an overall clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 41.5%. 20.7%(17/82) showed stable disease for ≥ 9 months and 13.4% for ≥ 12 months. None ofthe investigated predicting factors were significantly associated with clinicalbenefit at 6 months. For 43.9% of the patients, treatment delay or dose reductionwas indicated.CONCLUSIONS: Palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy shows anunexpectedly high CBR and favorable safety profile in heavily pretreatedendocrine-resistant estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative MBC patients.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4827-6 PMID: 29766363
