D/PSP@CQ/CaP was prepared by coprecipitatingchloroquine phosphate (CQ) with calcium chloride, in the form ofchloroquine-calcium phosphate coprecipitate (CQ/CaP), onto the surface of adeep-tumor-penetrating doxorubicine (DOX)-loading core particle (named as"D/PSP"). CQ/CaP could partly disintegrate and release CQ within tumormicroenvironment and totally be dissolved within lysosomes. Paxillin is a keycomponent of focal adhesion which functions to anchor tumors cells within theprimary tumor for limiting cancer cells' detachment from the primary tumor. Wetested that autophagy inhibition caused by CQ released from CQ/CaP could reducethe degradation of paxillin by 2.9 folds in vitro and 2.5 folds in vivo (vs.Control), respectively. Thus metastasis could be influenced by exploitingautophagy-dependent paxillin degradation. Data analysis together proved thatD/PSP@CQ/CaP decreased the cancer metastatic extent by 7.5 folds (vs. Control) onmice model via inhibiting the autophagy-dependent disassembly of focal adhesion. At the same time, the growth rate of tumors treated by D/PSP@CQ/CaP was inhibitedby 9.1 folds (vs. Control), which could be attributed to its effective tumor drugdelivery.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
