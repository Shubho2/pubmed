Outcomes of patients remaindisappointing and treatment options are limited, usually involving multimodality approaches. Brain metastases represent an unmet medical need in solid tumor care,especially in breast cancer, where brain metastases are frequent and result inimpaired quality of life and death. Challenges in the management of brainmetastases have been highlighted in this review. Innovative research andtreatment strategies, including prevention approaches and emerging systemictreatment options for brain metastases of breast cancer, are further discussed.DOI: 10.1177/1758835918780312 PMCID: PMC6024336PMID: 29977353
