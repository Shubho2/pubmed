[Epub ahead of print]Radiographically guided shave margins may reduce lumpectomy re-excision rates.Larson KE(1), Jadeja P(2), Marko A(3), Jadeja V(4), Pratt D(5).Author information: (1)Department of Breast Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.(2)Summit Medical Group, Florham Park, NJ, USA.(3)Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, OH, USA.(4)Teva Pharmaceuticals, Elizabeth, NJ, USA.(5)Cleveland Clinic, Fairview Hospital, Cleveland, OH, USA.Minimizing margin re-excision optimizes patient care by providing appropriateoncologic resection and reducing costs. This study aims to assess marginpositivity rate in two groups: shave margin based on gross specimen (controlgroup, CG) vs shave margin based on intraoperative imaging (radiographic group,RG). A total of 182 patients who underwent lumpectomy for stage O-III breastcancer at a single institution from January 2013 to January 2014 were evaluated. There was statistically significant decrease in margin re-excision rate withintraoperative mammography but not with ultrasound. Surgeons are ideally equippedto use intraoperative imaging to guide margin excision, thus, improving care and reducing costs.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13050 PMID: 29687530
