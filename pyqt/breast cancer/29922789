The X-raymolecular structure of platinum(ii) compound cm3 is also presented.Intermolecular oxidative addition of methyl iodide or iodine upon cm1, cm2 andcm3 produced six novel cyclometallated platinum(iv) compounds. The cytotoxicactivity against a panel of human adenocarcinoma cell lines (A-549 lung,MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast, and HCT-116 colon), DNA interaction, topoisomeraseI, IIα, and cathepsin B inhibition, and cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and ROSgeneration of the investigated complexes are presented. The best results forantiproliferative activity were obtained for platinum(iv) compounds cm1MeI andcm1I2 arising from oxidative addition of methyl iodide and iodine, respectively, to cm1. Cyclometallated platinum(iv) compounds cm1MeI and cm3MeI inducesignificant changes in the mobility of DNA and, in addition, cm1MeI, cm3MeI andcm1I2, showed considerable topoisomerase IIα inhibitory activity. Moreover, thecompounds exhibiting the higher antiproliferative activity (cm1MeI and cm1I2)were found to generate ROS and to supress HCT-116 colon cancer cell growth by amixture of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. 1H NMR experiments carried out in a buffered aqueous medium (pH 7.40) indicate that compound cm1MeI is notreduced by common biologically relevant reducing agents such as ascorbic acid,glutathione or cysteine.DOI: 10.1039/c8dt01124a PMID: 29922789
