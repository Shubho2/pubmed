Electronic address: jean_zhao@dfci.harvard.edu.Pharmacologic inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) haverecently entered the therapeutic armamentarium of clinical oncologists, and show promising activity in patients with breast and other cancers. Although theirchief mechanism of action is inhibition of retinoblastoma (RB) proteinphosphorylation and thus the induction of cell cycle arrest, CDK4/6 inhibitorsalter cancer cell biology in other ways that can also be leveraged fortherapeutic benefit. These include modulation of mitogenic kinase signaling,induction of a senescence-like phenotype, and enhancement of cancer cellimmunogenicity. We describe here the less-appreciated effects of CDK4/6inhibitors on cancer cells, and suggest ways by which they might be exploited to enhance the benefits of these agents for cancer patients.Copyright Â© 2018.
