[Epub ahead ofprint]Carcinogenesis and Reactive Oxygen Species Signaling: Interaction of the NADPHOxidase NOX1-5 and Superoxide Dismutase 1-3 Signal Transduction Pathways.Parascandolo A(1), Laukkanen MO(1).Author information: (1)IRCCS SDN , Naples, Italy .SIGNIFICANCE: Reduction/oxidation (redox) balance could be defined as an evendistribution of reduction and oxidation complementary processes and theirreaction end products. There is a consensus that aberrant levels of reactiveoxygen species (ROS), commonly observed in cancer, stimulate primary cellimmortalization and progression of carcinogenesis. However, the mechanism howdifferent ROS regulate redox balance is not completely understood. RecentAdvances: In the current review, we have summarized the main signaling cascadesinducing NADPH oxidase NOX1-5 and superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1-3 expression andtheir connection to cell proliferation, immortalization, transformation, andCD34+ cell differentiation in thyroid, colon, lung, breast, and hematologicalcancers.CRITICAL ISSUES: Interestingly, many of the signaling pathways activating redoxenzymes or mediating the effect of ROS are common, such as pathways initiatedfrom G protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors involving protein kinase A, phospholipase C, calcium, and small GTPase signaling molecules.FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The clarification of interaction of signal transductionpathways could explain how cells regulate redox balance and may even providemeans to inhibit the accumulation of harmful levels of ROS in human pathologies.
