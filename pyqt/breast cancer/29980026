It remains unknown whether thisassociation reflects an increase in the incidence rates of extra-hepatic cancers in adolescents and younger.METHODS: We examined 10 common extra-hepatic cancers (lung, breast, gastric,prostate, esophageal, rectal, cervical, nasopharyngeal, lymphatic, and urinarybladder) among patients diagnosed at three Chinese hospitals during 2007-2016. Wecompared the percentage distribution (frequencies at each age point are shown as a percentage of the total frequency) of HBsAg+ with HBsAg- patients, andcalculated the standardized incidence ratio for each age group.RESULTS: A total of 60,323 patients were identified. The mean age at cancerdiagnosis was 1.5-5.5 years younger in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)positive patients compared to HBsAg- patients (p ≤ 0.001). Lymphoma patients had the highest prevalence rate of HBV infection (20.7%). Among the pooled HBsAg+cancer patients, 14.8% (1138/7666) were aged ≤39 years; by contrast, 9.7%(5122/52657) of HBsAg- cancer patients were in the same age range, giving an oddsratio of 1.6 [95%CI1.509-1.733)]. The observations were similar when each cancer was considered individually. The odds ratio was greater in pooled male patientsaged ≤39 years [1.9(95%CI1.705-2.085)] compared with females[1.6(95%CI1.382-1.83)]. The ratio of the observed to the expected number ofHBsAg+ patients aged 15-19, 20-24, and 25-29 years were 3.3, 4.8 and 2.0,respectively, higher than 1.2-1.7 observed for older age-groups.CONCLUSION: HBV infection is a risk factor for diverse extra-hepatic cancers inadolescents and 20s.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
