Thisprofile is associated with dysregulation of the immune system, including enhancedinflammatory reactions and accelerated senescence. Subjects exposed to ear stresshave increased risk for several age-related diseases, including cardiovasculardisease, type II diabetes, and cancer. Although previous studies have reportedimmune changes in advanced cancer, very little information is available regardingearly stage breast cancer. Here, 29 patients with breast cancer were recruited:15 with history of childhood maltreatment (CM+) and 14 without history (CM-).Twenty-seven healthy women without CM were selected as the control group.Peripheral blood was collected and lymphocyte subsets phenotyped by multi-colorflow cytometry (B cells, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, natural killer cells, activated T cells,regulatory T cells, and senescence-associated T cells). Because humancytomegalovirus (CMV) was associated with signatures of early senescence, the CMVserology was determined by ELISA. None of the subjects had IgM reactivity to CMV,excluding acute viral infection. There was a higher proportion of patients withincreased CMV IgG levels in the CM+ group as compared to CM- or controls.Different stages of T-cell differentiation can be determined based on thecell-surface expression of the costimulatory molecules CD27 and CD28: ear(CD27+CD28+), intermediate-differentiated (CD27-CD28+), and late-differentiatedor senescent T cells (CD27-CD28-). After adjusting for age and education, ear Tcells (CD27+CD28+) were found reduced in CM+ and CM- patients (p < 0.0001). Incontrast, intermediate-differentiated T cells (CD27-CD28+; p < 0.0001), senescentT cells (CD27-CD28-; p < 0.0001), and exhausted T cells (CD8+CD27-CD28-PD1+;p < 0.0001) were found expanded in both CM+ and CM- groups. Our data suggest thatfeatures of immunosenescence are associated with newly diagnosed breast cancer,regardless of the CM history.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01651 PMCID: PMC6055359PMID: 30061900
