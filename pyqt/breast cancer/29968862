We report a study on radiotherapy for breast cancer patients in Umbria, Italy, where geographic barriers reduced appropriate radiotherapy for patientswith a travel burden as low as >40 minutes and the under-treatment was associatedwith low survival probabilities. The creation of additional radiotherapy centres (i.e. decentralization) improved appropriate care. However, evidence pointed alsoto a role of access to the oncology service through rural surgical centres indetermining suboptimal treatment and health outcomes. We introduced radiotherapy in breast cancer patients as an instance of the complexity of cancer care. Theoncology network is actively introduced in Italian health services as a tool toface problems of equity, quality of care and effective use of availableresources. Meaningful information on care process and outcomes will be central toset cancer control strategies within the network and to assess the networkresults. Cancer registries can contribute to network effectiveness providingsurveillance and evaluation data.DOI: 10.1701/2932.29488 PMID: 29968862
