We report an unusual case of a50-year-old male, with no family history of breast cancer, who presented with an 8-year history of left-sided breast pain and recurrent bloody nipple dischargewithout any significant suspicious imaging features in mammography and targetedhigh-resolution ultrasound. Breast magnetic resonance imaging was performed as anadjunct modality. Magnetic resonance imaging findings revealed a suspiciousretroareolar non-mass abnormality of segmental, linear and dendritic pattern,which was highly suspicious for a ductal carcinoma in situ. Stereotactic guidedbiopsy and subsequent mastectomy were consistent with pure high-grade ductalcarcinoma in situ of the left breast. Overall, this case highlights thechallenges in diagnosing ductal carcinoma in situ in men and demonstrates theimportance for further investigating clinical suspicions of the male breast.DOI: 10.1177/2050313X18781727 PMCID: PMC6024341PMID: 29977557
