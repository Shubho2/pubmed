Here we report that ASF1A is physicallyassociated with USP52, which is previously identified as a pseudo-deubiquitinase.Interestingly, we demonstrate that USP52 is a bona fide ubiquitin-specificprotease, and USP52 promotes ASF1A deubiquitination and stabilization.USP52-promoted ASF1A stabilization facilitates chromatin assembly and favors cellcycle progression. Additionally, we find that USP52 is overexpressed in breastcarcinomas, and its level of expression correlates with that of ASF1A. Moreover, we reveal that impairment of USP52-promoted ASF1A stabilization results in growtharrest of breast cancer cells and sensitizes these cells to DNA damage. Ourexperiments identify USP52 as a truly protein deubiquitinase, uncover a molecularmechanism of USP52 in chromatin assembly, and reveal a potential role of USP52 inbreast carcinogenesis.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03588-z PMCID: PMC5876348PMID: 29599486
