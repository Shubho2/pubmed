Case-mix adjusted comparisons were performed usinggeneralized linear mixed-effects models to assess variation across the centers inany complication, major complications, satisfaction with outcome, andsatisfaction with breast.RESULTS: Among 2252 women in the analytic cohort, 1605 (71.3%) underwentimplant-based and 647 (28.7%) underwent autologous breast reconstruction. Therewere significant differences in the sociodemographic and clinicalcharacteristics, and distribution of procedure types at the different Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium Study centers. After case-mix adjustments,hospital variations in the rates of any and major postoperative complicationswere observed. Medical center odds ratios for major complication ranged from 0.58to 2.13, compared with the average major complication rate across centers. There were also meaningful differences in satisfaction with outcome (from the lowest tohighest of -2.79-2.62) and in satisfaction with breast (-2.82-2.07) compared withthe average values.CONCLUSIONS: Two-year postoperative complications varied widely between hospitalsfollowing post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. These variations represent animportant opportunity to improve care through dissemination of best practices andhighlight the limitations of extrapolating single-institution level data and the ongoing challenges of studying hospital-based outcomes for this patientpopulation.DOI: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000002711 PMID: 29489482
