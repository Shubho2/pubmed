[Epub aheadof print]Barriers to care for breast cancer: A qualitative study in Ireland.Byrne J(1), Campbell H(1), Gilchrist M(2), Summersby E(2), Hennessy B(2).Author information: (1)Boyne Research Institute, Drogheda, Ireland.(2)Oncology Unit, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Ireland.Disparities in survival after breast cancer persist. Cancer registry data thatare often used to assess associated factors only explain some of the differences.The purpose of this study was to obtain information from disadvantaged Irishwomen concerning possible barriers to care for breast cancer above and beyondrisk factors collected by cancer registries. We used a qualitative interviewstudy with disadvantaged women in treatment for breast cancer, following themethods of thematic analysis. Important themes potentially related to disparityoccurred in each treatment phase. Before diagnosis themes included delays indiagnosis. During treatment themes concerned surgical complications,communication difficulties and use of alternative therapies. During the posttreatment phase a strong theme was lack of compliance with hormone therapy.Overarching themes were stress related to disadvantage, including financialdifficulties, obesity, alcohol use, fears of eviction from home, worry aboutdependent relatives. Future studies of the breast cancer survival gap arisingfrom socio-economic disadvantage may benefit from a mixed-methods approach thatcombines cancer registry data with personal interviews to understand thepersistence of survival disparities. As breast cancer rates continue to risedisparities in survival due to socio-economic disadvantage will continue, but canbe addressed and mitigated.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ecc.12876 PMID: 30028056
