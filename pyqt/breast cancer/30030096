Electronic address: zshaikh@uri.edu.Cadmium (Cd) has been linked to a variety of cancers, including breast cancer;however, the molecular mechanism of its carcinogenic activity is not fullyunderstood. To this end, the present study investigated the roles of ferroportin (FPN), a prognostic marker of breast cancer, in Cd-induced stimulation of cellproliferation and cell migration. Triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells were treatedwith 1-3 μM Cd. The cells exhibited significant reduction in FPN expression andconcomitant increase in iron concentration. Cells treated with Cd for 8 weeksdisplayed elevated proliferative and migratory activities which were inverselyrelated with FPN expression. Reduced FPN expression also resulted in EMT asindicated by an increase in the expression of E-cadherin, and a decrease in theexpression of N-cadherin, Twist and Slug. Further investigation revealed that Cd suppressed FPN expression at least partially by activating TGF-β, a knownregulator of FPN expression. Taken together, these results indicate thatCd-induced stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, EMT, and migration isbrought about by suppression of FPN expression and associated disruption of iron homeostasis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
