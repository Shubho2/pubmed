As a solution to facilitate reconstruction, skin bankingof free-flap skin has been proposed in cases where the overlying skin envelopemust be resected, as this technique spares the patient an additional donor site. Herein, we present the largest series to date in which this method was used. Weinvestigated its safety and the possibility of skin banking for prolonged periodsof time.METHODS: All skin-sparing mastectomies and immediate autologous breastreconstructions from December 2009 until June 2013 at our institution wereanalysed.RESULTS: We identified 31 patients who underwent 33 free flap reconstructions in which skin banking was performed. Our median skin banking period was 7 days, witha maximum duration of 171 days. In 22.5% of cases, the banked skin was used toreconstruct overlying skin defects, and in 9.6% of cases to reconstruct thenipple-areolar complex. Microbiological and histological investigations of thebanked skin revealed neither clinical infections nor malignancies.CONCLUSIONS: In situ skin banking, even for prolonged periods of time, is a safe and cost-effective method to ensure that skin defects due to necrosis orsecondary oncological resection can be easily reconstructed.DOI: 10.5999/aps.2017.01382 PMCID: PMC5869435PMID: 29506331
