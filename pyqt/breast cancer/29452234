XRCC4 is one of theessential proteins of this pathway and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of this gene are reported to be associated with cancer risks. In our study, we firstused computational approaches to predict the damaging variants of XRCC4 gene.Tools predicted rs79561451 (S110P) nsSNP as the most deleterious SNP. Along with this SNP, we analysed other two SNPs (rs3734091 and rs6869366) to study theirassociation with breast cancer in population of West India. Variant rs3734091 wasfound to be significantly associated with breast cancer while rs6869366 variantdid not show any association. These SNPs may influence the susceptibility ofindividuals to breast cancer in this population.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
