We conducted this study to examinetrends in incidence of breast cancer in a developing country, Sri Lanka.METHODS: A retrospective cohort evaluation of patients with breast cancer during 2001-2010 was performed using population based data from the Sri Lanka NationalCancer Registry. Trends in incidence were analysed using Joinpoint regressionanalysis.RESULTS: The age standardized incidence of female breast cancer in Sri Lankaappears to have increased from 17.3 per 100,000 in 2001 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 16.5-18.2) to 24.7 per 100,000 in 2010 (95% CI 23.7-25.7); a 1.4-foldincrease (p < 0.05) with an estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of 4.4 (95%CI 3.3-5.5). Highest incidence of breast cancer was seen among women of 60 to64-year age group which has increased from 68.1 to 100.2 per 100,000 over thisperiod (EAPC 4.6%, 95% CI 3.9-5.2, p < 0.001 for trend). A substantially greater increase was observed among women older than 50 years (from 50.4 to 76.9 per100,000; EAPC 5.5, 95% CI 4.1-7.0, p < 0.05) compared with women younger than50 years (from 32.0 to 39.6 per 100,000; EAPC 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-3.5, p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: A gradual but a significant increase in the incidence of femalebreast cancer is observed in Sri Lanka. A rapid rise in the breast cancerincidence among post-menopausal women appears to be the major contributor towardsthis increase. Improving cancer data collection appears to have been acontributor to the observed increase. However, an inherent increase is alsolikely as differential rates of increase were observed by age groups. Furtherresearch is needed to identify the reasons for the observed increase which mayhelp with future cancer control efforts in Sri Lanka.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4408-4 PMCID: PMC5924495PMID: 29703165
