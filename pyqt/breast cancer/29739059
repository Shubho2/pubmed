It canpromote the occurrence and development of cancers by affecting cellproliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. This article reviews theprogress of lncRNA PVT1 on cancer therapy, in order to facilitate the in-depthstudy of lncRNA PVT1 acting as a promising target for therapy in cancers.METHODS: We extracted all relevant studies of lncRNA PVT1 on the treatment ofcancers by searching electronic databases Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science frominception to November 30, 2017.RESULTS: Accumulating vigorous evidence has shown that lncRNA PVT1 performs asignificant carcinogenic activity in various cancers, for instance, negativelymodulating miRNA as a ceRNA or a molecular sponge to exert tumor-promotingeffect. Based on the critical role of lncRNA PVT1 in the pathogenesis of cancers,numerous studies have already demonstrated that lncRNA PVT1 might serve as apotential therapeutic target for various cancers, such as non-small cell lungcancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, glioma, etc.CONCLUSIONS: Numerous studies have indicated that lncRNA PVT1 will most likelybecome a novel target for cancer therapy with the deepening systematic research.PMID: 29739059
