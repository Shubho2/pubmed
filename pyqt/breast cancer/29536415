This study aimed to evaluate the validity of these self-reported measures among African American (AA) breastcancer survivors, known to have high obesity prevalence.METHODS: We compared the self-reported and measured values among 243 participantsfrom the Women's Circle of Health Follow-Up Study (WCHFS), a population-basedlongitudinal study of AA breast cancer survivors. Multivariable-adjusted linearregressions were used to identify factors associated with reporting errors. Wealso examined the associations of self-reported and measured BMI withobesity-related health outcomes using multivariable logistic regressions, withhypertension as an example, to evaluate the impact of misreporting.RESULTS: We found that self-reported and measured values were highly correlatedamong all and when stratified by participants' characteristics (intraclasscorrelation coefficients ≥ 0.99, 0.84, and 0.96 for weight, height, and BMI,respectively). The agreement between BMI categories (normal, overweight andobese) based on self-reported and measured data was excellent (kappa = 0.81).Women who were older, never smoked, had higher grade tumors, or had greater BMItended to have overestimated BMI calculated from self-reported weight and height.The BMI-hypertension association was similar using self-reported (OR per 5 kg/m2 increase 1.63; 95% CI 1.27-2.10) and measured BMI (1.58; 95% CI 1.23-2.03).CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported weight, height, and BMI were reasonably accurate inthe WCHFS.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Our study supports the use of theseself-reported values among cancer survivors when direct measurements are notpossible.DOI: 10.1007/s11764-018-0685-9 PMCID: PMC6054548 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29536415
