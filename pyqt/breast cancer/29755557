Silibinin, a widely used drug andsupplement for various liver disorders, demonstrated anti-cancer effects on humanhepatocellular carcinoma, human prostate adenocarcinoma cells, human breastcarcinoma cells, human ectocervical carcinoma cells, and human colon cancercells. Considering the anti-hepatotoxic activity of silibinin and its strongpreventive and anti-cancer efficacy against various epithelial cancers, weinvestigated the efficacy of silibinin against human HCC and HUVEC cell lines.Silibinin effects on the growth and mode of cell death of these two cell linesare presented in this paper. HepG2 and HUVEC cells were incubated with different doses of silibinin (12.5, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 Î¼g/mL) at 24, 48, and 72 h.Cytotoxicity was assessed using MTT and Trypan blue assays. Mode of cell deathinduced by silibinin was investigated using LDH assay and acridine orange/PIdouble dye staining. The results showed that silibinin has dose-dependentinhibitory effect on the viability of HepG2 and HUVEC cells. However, Silibinincauses a more continuous dose-dependent cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells compared tothe HUVEC cells in which some degrees of resistance is apparent at the beginning.The mode of cell death looks also different in these two cell lines with HepG2cells being more in favor of apoptosis while necrosis is more evident for theHUVEC cells.PMCID: PMC5937096PMID: 29755557
