Distant metastases, especially intrahepaticmetastases, is the leading cause of death for pancreatic cancer. Circulatingtumor cells (CTCs) are neoplastic cells released from the primary tumor intocirculation, and play critical roles in metastases of various types of cancers.Though clinical studies showed that detection of CTCs in peripheral circulationwas associated with worse prognosis in patients with breast cancer andhepatocellular carcinoma, detection CTCs in peripheral blood of pancreatic cancerwas still challenging due to hepatic filtration and technical limitations.Previous studies have demonstrated that CTCs could be detected in portal veincirculation in patients with pancreaticobiliary carcinoma. In the present study, taking advantage of ultrasonography-guided transhepatic puncture, we analysisCTCs in portal vein blood obtained from patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.CTCs were detected in all 29-portal vein blood of samples, and absolute numbersof circulating pancreatic cancer cells in portal vein was significantly higherthan that in peripheral circulation. Furthermore, we found that CTC counts inportal vein was highly associated with intrahepatic metastases and indicatedpoorer prognosis in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Short-termexpansion and in vitro drug sensitivity assay showed that CTCs derived fromportal vein blood were highly resistant to several chemotherapy regimens. Insummary, detection of CTCs in portal vein could be a powerful tool to stratifythe risk of intrahepatic metastases of pancreatic cancer, and provided newinsight into the biological feature of pancreatic cancer metastases and drugresistance.DOI: 10.7150/jca.23989 PMCID: PMC5995938PMID: 29896289
