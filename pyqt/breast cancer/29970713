However, there has been little study with respect to the relationship between the expression of IRS-1 and breastcancer prognosis in clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the estrogen receptor (ER) and IRS-1 on the recurrence and survival of breastcancer patients.Methods: We analyzed the pathologic finding of 376 tissue samples from breastcancer patients who received proper treatment between January 1990 and December2006 using the tissue microarray. We measured the expression of ER and IRS-1 byimmunohistochemistry staining and analyzed the difference of recurrence andsurvival rate in each subgroup of ER and IRS-1.Results: Our results show that there is a significant difference of disease-free survival (DFS) according to ER and IRS-1 subgroups with both univariate andmultivariate analyses. Specifically, ER-positive and IRS-1-positive breast cancersamples showed improved DFS compared to ER-positive and IRS-1-negative breastcancer (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.17; 95% confidence interval: 1.15-4.09; P =0.01). There was a difference of overall survival according to ER and IRS-1subgroups by univariate analysis (P = 0.01), but not by multivariate analysis (P = 0.36).Conclusion: ER and IRS-1 subgroups appear to be critical factors for theprediction of breast cancer recurrence. In particular, we suggest that thepatients who have ER-positive and IRS-1-negative breast cancer undergo moreaggressive treatment because they have poorer prognoses.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.181180 PMID: 29970713
