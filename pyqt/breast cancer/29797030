In order to predict intolerance during radiotherapy, this study retrospectively analyzedthe frequency of and risk factors for radiotherapy interruption among geriatricpatients.METHODS: From September 2009 to December 2016, 353 patients aged ≥70 yearsreceived definitive radiotherapy with a conventionally fractionated schedule."Total interruption" included completion of ≤90% of a planned radiotherapy,temporary discontinuation, and treatment-related mortality within 2 months."Early-phase incompletion" and "mid-phase incompletion" represented completion of≤50 and ≤80% of a planned radiotherapy, respectively.RESULTS: The median age of patients was 74 years. Early- and mid-phaseincompletions and total interruption occurred in 4.2, 9.3, and 19.3% of patients,respectively. Total interruption occurred frequently in cancers involving thethorax (27.4%), head and neck (23.1%), abdomen (20.0%), pelvis (17.4%), andbreast/extremity (8.1%). The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)performance score (P = 0.004 and 0.002), serum albumin level (P = 0.016 and0.002), and the expected 5‑year survival (P = 0.033 and 0.034) were significantfactors for mid-phase incompletion and total interruption. Age ≥ 75 years(P = 0.008), concurrent chemotherapy (P = 0.017), and the extent of radiationfield (P = 0.027) were factors associated with total interruption.CONCLUSION: Overall, 19.3% of the elderly patients showed treatment intoleranceduring conventional radiotherapy. Serum albumin level and ECOG performance score should be considered as surrogate markers for radiotherapy interruption prior to the decision regarding definite conventional radiotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00066-018-1318-y PMID: 29797030
