All trials met the following inclusion criteria: (1)included women with HR+/HER2- mBC; (2) previous treatment with ETs orchemotherapy as first-line therapy; (3) treatment with ET as monotherapy or incombination with targeted therapy; (4) progression-free survival (PFS) wasreported; and (5) published in 2007 (when HER2 testing became standardized) orlater. Regimens were compared using pairwise hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% credibleintervals (CrIs) of PFS obtained from a Bayesian NMA. Treatments with differentapproved dosages were pooled into the same arm; anastrozole and exemestane werepooled as aromatase inhibitors (AIs) due to clinical similarities.RESULTS: A total of 4 trials and 6 regimens (palbociclib + fulvestrant,everolimus + fulvestrant, everolimus + AI, fulvestrant + AI, fulvestrant and AI) were eligible for inclusion. Palbociclib + fulvestrant and everolimus + AI had50% and 55% reduced hazard of progression or death vs. AI (95% CrI upper bound≤1), respectively. Palbociclib + fulvestrant, everolimus + AI andeverolimus + fulvestrant had 54%, 58% and 40% reduced hazard vs. fulvestrant (95%CrI upper bound ≤1), while palbociclib + fulvestrant and everolimus + AI had 52% and 55% reduced hazard vs. fulvestrant + AI (95% CrI upper bound ≤1),respectively.CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC who had previously failed an NSAI and received palbociclib + fulvestrant, everolimus + AI oreverolimus + fulvestrant had longer PFS compared to those who receivedfulvestrant or AI alone.DOI: 10.1080/03007995.2018.1479246 PMID: 29781326
