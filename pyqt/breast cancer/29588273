To address this problem, we developed amobile health (mHealth) app for assessing and monitoring healthy lifestyles inbreast cancer survivors, called the Energy Balance on Cancer (BENECA) mHealthsystem. The BENECA mHealth system is a novel and interactive mHealth app, whichallows breast cancer survivors to engage themselves in their energy balancemonitoring. BENECA was designed to facilitate adherence to healthy lifestyles in an easy and intuitive way.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the concurrent validity andtest-retest reliability between the BENECA mHealth system and the gold standardassessment methods for diet and physical activity.METHODS: A reliability study was conducted with 20 breast cancer survivors. Inthe study, tri-axial accelerometers (ActiGraphGT3X+) were used as gold standardfor 8 consecutive days, in addition to 2, 24-hour dietary recalls, 4 dietaryrecords, and sociodemographic questionnaires. Two-way random effect intraclasscorrelation coefficients, a linear regression-analysis, and a Passing-Bablokregression were calculated.RESULTS: The reliability estimates were very high for all variables (alpha≥.90). The lowest reliability was found in fruit and vegetable intakes (alpha=.94). The reliability between the accelerometer and the dietary assessment instrumentsagainst the BENECA system was very high (intraclass correlation coefficient=.90).We found a mean match rate of 93.51% between instruments and a mean phantom rate of 3.35%. The Passing-Bablok regression analysis did not show considerable biasin fat percentage, portions of fruits and vegetables, or minutes of moderate tovigorous physical activity.CONCLUSIONS: The BENECA mHealth app could be a new tool to measure energy balancein breast cancer survivors in a reliable and simple way. Our results support the use of this technology to not only to encourage changes in breast cancersurvivors' lifestyles, but also to remotely monitor energy balance.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02817724;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02817724 (Archived by WebCite athttp://www.webcitation.org/6xVY1buCc).©Mario Lozano-Lozano, Noelia Galiano-Castillo, Lydia Martín-Martín, NicolásPace-Bedetti, Carolina Fernández-Lao, Manuel Arroyo-Morales, IreneCantarero-Villanueva.
