[Epub ahead of print]Turning straw into gold: building robustness into gene signature inference.Goh WWB(1), Wong L(2).Author information: (1)School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.Electronic address: wilsongoh@ntu.edu.sg.(2)Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore;Department of Pathology, National University of Singapore, Singapore. Electronic address: wongls@comp.nus.edu.sg.Reproducible and generalizable gene signatures are essential for clinicaldeployment, but are hard to come by. The primary issue is insufficient mitigationof confounders: ensuring that hypotheses are appropriate, test statistics andnull distributions are appropriate, and so on. To further improve robustness,additional good analytical practices (GAPs) are needed, namely: leveragingexisting data and knowledge; careful and systematic evaluation of gene sets, evenif they overlap with known sources of confounding; and rigorous testing ofinferred signatures against as many published data sets as possible. Here, using a re-examination of a breast cancer data set and 48 published signatures, weillustrate the value of adopting these GAPs.Copyright Â© 2018.
