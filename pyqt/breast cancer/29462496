Following literature searching and study selection,study quality was examined by using the Critical Appraisal Skill ProgrammeChecklist. Qualitative data were extracted verbatim from included studies andsynthesized by using thematic analysis.RESULTS: Fifteen studies that included lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) peopleliving with or beyond cancer were included in the review. Studies includinggender minorities were not identified. Most of the study participants were sexualminority women with breast cancer or sexual minority men with prostate cancer.Meta-synthesis of 106 individual findings generated 6 overarching themespertaining to sexual orientation disclosure, experiences and fear of homophobia, positive and negative health-care professional behaviors, heterocentric systemsand care, inadequacy of available support groups, and unmet needs forpatient-centered care and LGB-specific information. Lesbian, gay, and bisexualpeople often reported feelings of anxiety, invisibility, isolation, andfrustration throughout the cancer care continuum.CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the experiences of LGB people with cancer care showsthat LGB people face numerous challenges due to their sexual orientation andreceive care that does not adequately address their needs. Training and educationof health-care professionals are strongly recommended to address some of thesechallenges and practice gaps. Culturally appropriate care includes avoidingheterosexual assumptions, use of inclusive language, the provision of tailoredinformation, and involving partners in care.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4674 PMID: 29462496
