[Epub ahead of print]Mammographic breast density in recent and longer-standing ethiopian immigrants toisrael.Sklair-Levy M(1)(2), Segev A(3), Sella T(3), Calderon-Margalit R(4), ZippelD(2)(5).Author information: (1)Department of Diagnostic Imaging, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer,Israel.(2)Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.(3)Department of Radiology-Medical Imaging, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem,Israel.(4)Hadassah-Hebrew University Braun School of Public Health, Jerusalem, Israel.(5)Department of Surgery C, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.High breast density is associated with an increased risk of breast cancerdevelopment. Little is known concerning ethnic variations in breast density andits relevant contributing factors. We aimed to study breast density amongEthiopian immigrants to Israel in comparison with Israeli-born women and todetermine any effect on breast density of the length of residency in theimmigrant population. Mammographic breast density using the BI-RADS system wasestimated and compared between 77 women of Ethiopian origin who live in Israeland 177 Israeli-born controls. Logistic regression analysis was performed toestimate the odds ratios (OR) for high density (BI-RADS score ≥ 3) vs low density(BI-RADS score < 3) cases, comparing the 2 origin groups. Ethiopian-born womenhad a crude OR of 0.15 (95% CI: 0.08-0.26) for high breast density compared with Israeli-born women. Adjustments for various cofounders did not affect theresults. Time since immigration to Israel seemed to modify the relationship, witha stronger association for women who immigrated within 2 years prior tomammography (OR:0.07, 95% CI: 0.03-0.17) as opposed to women with a longerresidency stay in Israel (OR:0.23, 95% CI:0.10-0.50). Adjustments of variousconfounders did not alter these findings. Breast density in Ethiopian immigrants to Israel is significantly lower than that of Israeli-born controls. Our studysuggests a positive association between time since immigration and breastdensity. Future studies are required to define the possible effects of dietarychange on mammographic density following immigration.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13042 PMID: 29687576
