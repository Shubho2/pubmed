However, little is known about its contribution to breast malignancies. Here, we report SIK2 as a potential tumorsuppressor in breast cancer whose expression was reduced in tumor tissues andbreast cancer cell lines compared to normal counterparts. In vitro loss- andgain-of-function experiments combined with xenograft studies demonstrated thatSIK2-mediated attenuation of proliferation and survival of breast cancer cellswith parallel inhibition of both Ras/Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways. Our findingselucidated that SIK2 has also an inhibitory role in migration/invasion ability ofbreast cancer cells through regulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition.Immunostaining of patient tumors revealed that SIK2 protein level is frequentlydownregulated in invasive mammary carcinomas and negatively correlated with themitotic activity of the cells in triple negative breast cancers and hormonepositive tumors. Strikingly, patient survival analysis indicated that higherlevels of SIK2 are significantly associated with better survival, especially inbasal breast cancer cases. Overall, our findings suggest SIK2 as a potentialtumor suppressor in the control of breast tumorigenesis, at least in part, viainhibiting PI3K/Akt and Ras/ERK signaling cascades simultaneously and a novelprognostic marker, especially in basal subtypes of breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25082 PMCID: PMC5955149PMID: 29774109
