[Epub ahead of print]Efficacy of Different Leuprolide Administration Schedules in Premenopausal BreastCancer: A Retrospective Review.Kendzierski DC(1), Schneider BP(2), Kiel PJ(2).Author information: (1)Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN.Electronic address: daniel.kendzierski@osumc.edu.(2)Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN.BACKGROUND: Leuprolide is a safe and effective treatment of estrogenreceptor-positive premenopausal breast cancer. Data from the SOFT/TEXT trialssolidified leuprolide in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as an effective hormonal treatment for premenopausal breast cancer. However, the efficacy ofmonthly leuprolide depot compared to leuprolide depot every 3 months incombination with an aromatase inhibitor in this patient population is unclear.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single center retrospective study, 201 patientswere enrolled between January 1, 2015, and October 1, 2016; 100 were included in the 7.5 mg leuprolide monthly injection plus aromatase inhibitor group and 101 inthe 22.5 mg leuprolide injection every 3 months plus aromatase inhibitor group.The primary end point was the proportion of patients who experienced ovarianablation, defined as an estradiol concentration less than 40 pg/mL and afollicle-stimulating hormone concentration of 23 to 116 mU/mL after 3 months oftreatment. Significance threshold was P < .05 (2 sided). Secondary end pointsincluded disease-free survival and overall survival at 1-year follow-up, as well as adverse events reported during treatment.RESULTS: All patients in the monthly leuprolide arm experienced ovarian ablation compared to 100 (99%) of 101 patients in the arm treated every 3 months (P = 1). The disease-free survival rate at 1 year was 95% in the monthly leuprolide armand 97% in the arm treated every 3 months (P = .75). The overall survival rate at1 year was 100% in the monthly leuprolide arm and 99% in the arm treated every 3 months (P = 1). The most common treatment-related adverse events between the 2groups were musculoskeletal pain, hot flashes, fatigue, and insomnia.CONCLUSION: Leuprolide acetate depot administered every 3 months is asefficacious and tolerable as a monthly injection in combination with an aromataseinhibitor for premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breastcancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
