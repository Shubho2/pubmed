Growing evidencesuggests that alcohol increases the risk of several types of cancer includingbreast, bowel, prostate, and liver, and accounts for a significant proportion of preventable cancers. Despite ample evidence of this relationship, publicawareness is less clear. Following Preferred Reporting Items for SystematicReviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we reviewed 32 studies examininglay awareness of alcohol as a risk factor for cancer in 16 countries. Our resultsshow that awareness appears to be low and varies internationally; it isrelatively higher in the United Kingdom, Morocco, and Australia. Methodologicdifferences in assessment obfuscate cross-country and cross-sample comparisons.In general, people are more likely to endorse alcohol as a risk factor whenpresented with a list of possible risk factors than when asked to list riskfactors in an open-ended format. Attempts to increase awareness have been limitedand constitute a significant public health need. We provide potential strategies to increase awareness, such as alcohol bottle labeling and fosteringpatient/physician discussions regarding the link.
