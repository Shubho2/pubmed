Clinical and pathologic data were also documented.Results: The median age of presentation was 65 years. Four cases had axillarylymphadenopathies, and two had distant metastases. An oval mass was the mostcommon sonographic finding (7/11; 64%). Lesions displayed circumscribed/partiallycircumscribed margins (6/11; 55%) or non-circumscribed margins (5/11; 45%). Most lesions had a heterogeneous echo structure (9/11; 82%) and posterior acousticenhancement (6/11; 55%). In nine patients, mammographies were available. An oval dense mass was the most common mammographic finding (5/9; 56%). The majority ofcases had non-circumscribed margins (6/9; 67%), and nearly half displayedcalcifications (4/9; 44%).Conclusions: Mammographic findings were not different from the usual features of more prevalent types of breast cancer, though the majority of metaplasticcarcinoma of the breast showed possible distinctive sonographic features, such ascircumscribed margins or complex echogenicity, reflecting the histologicbackground.DOI: 10.5334/jbsr.1386 PMCID: PMC6032488PMID: 30039058
