[Epubahead of print]Patterns of malignant non-mass enhancement on 3-T breast MRI help predictinvasiveness: using the BI-RADS lexicon fifth edition.Lee SM(1), Nam KJ(1), Choo KS(1), Kim JY(2), Jeong DW(3), Kim HY(4), Kim JY(5).Author information: (1)1 Department of Radiology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, PusanNational University School of Medicine, Gyeongnam, Republic of Korea.(2)2 Department of Radiology, Pusan National University Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.(3)3 Department of Family Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital,Pusan National University School of Medicine, Gyeongnam, Republic of Korea.(4)4 Department of Surgery, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, PusanNational University School of Medicine, Gyeongnam, Republic of Korea.(5)5 Department of Pathology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, PusanNational University School of Medicine, Gyeongnam, Republic of Korea.Background Non-mass enhancements (NME) with invasive components account for10-42% of total malignant NMEs. The factors associated with invasiveness onmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be useful for clinical assessment andtreatment. Purpose To evaluate the clinical significances of the distributionsand internal enhancement patterns (IEP) of malignant NMEs on 3-T breast MRI.Material and Methods A total of 448 consecutive women with newly diagnosed breastcancer that had undergone preoperative MRI and surgery between February 2013 and March 2016 were identified. After exclusions, 72 malignant NMEs without a mass in72 women (mean age = 51.5 years) were included. Two readers independentlyassessed distributions and IEPs of NME, according to the Breast Imaging Reportingand Data System lexicon fifth edition. Collected data included the presence ofinvasion and histopathologic factors. Results A clustered ring IEP wassignificantly associated with invasive cancer (75.0%, P = 0.001, Reader1; 72.9%, P < 0.001, Reader 2), absence of necrosis (79.0%, P < 0.001; 72.1%, P < 0.001,respectively), and high Ki-67 expression (74.2%, P = 0.048; 74.2%, P = 0.003,respectively). A clumped IEP was related to ductal carcinoma in situ (33.3%,P = 0.025; 50.0%, P = 0.001, respectively), absence of lymph node metastasis(24.1%, P = 0.029; 31.5%, P = 0.030, respectively), and presence of necrosis(34.5%, P = 0.003; 44.8%, P = 0.001, respectively). Conclusion The presence of a clustered ring IEP in patients with breast cancer was found to be significantlyassociated with invasive breast cancer and high Ki-67 expression.DOI: 10.1177/0284185118759139 PMID: 29758996
