We hypothesized that p53 alterationmodifies prognostic associations of FUT8 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC),since FUT8 has recently been identified as a direct transcriptional target ofwild-type p53. Utilizing multiple datasets of microarray and RNA sequence of CRC,FUT8 mRNA was found to be highly expressed in wild-type p53 tumors (n = 382)compared to those of mutant p53 (n = 437). Prognostic values of FUT8 expressionin conjunction with the p53 status for disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using two independent cohorts of stage II and III CRC after curative surgery,including the immunohistochemistry (IHC) cohort (n = 123) and the microarraycohort (n = 357). In both cohorts, neither FUT8 expression nor the p53 status wasassociated with DFS. Strikingly, positive expression of FUT8 protein wassignificantly associated with better DFS only in tumors with negative p53, while it had no prognostic impact in tumors with positive p53 in the IHC cohort.Although not statistically significant, a similar prognostic trend was observedin the microarray cohort when patients were stratified by the p53 status. Ourresults suggest that the prognostic values of FUT8 expression on DFS may bemodified by the p53 status, and the expression of FUT8 protein can be aprognostic biomarker for patients with stage II and III CRC.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200315 PMCID: PMC6033451PMID: 29975776
