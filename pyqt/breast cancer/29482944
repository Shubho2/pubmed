Electronic address: xianghua@cpu.edu.cn.Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancers and the leading causes of cancer death among females worldwide. Estrogen receptor positive has beenidentified as the predominant internal reasons, involving in more than 70% breastcancer patients and SERMs which competes with estradiol for the binding to ERα inbreast tissue are widely used in the treatment of ER+ breast cancer, such astamoxifen, raloxifene. However, many SERMs may cause negative side effects due totheir estrogenic activity in other tissues and approximate 50% of patients withER-positive tumors either initially do not respond or become resistant to thesedrugs. Here, a series of designed 4,6-diaryl-2-pyrimidinamine derivatives hadbeen synthesized to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancer bysimultaneously antagonizing ER and inhibiting VEGFR-2. Bioactivity evaluationshowed that these compounds could significantly inhibit the proliferation ofMCF-7, HUVEC and Ishikawa cells. Further studies identified compound III-3A couldantagonize against estrogen action and inhibit the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 as well as inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. The results indicated designed4,6-diaryl-2-pyrimidinamine derivatives can be used to further study asanti-breast cancer drugs.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
