As a secondary analysis, the corresponding numbers for ovarian cancer were estimated.METHODS: Historical breastfeeding data were obtained from population surveys.Duration of breastfeeding data were obtained from the French Épifane cohortstudy. Relative risks were obtained from meta-analyses, cohort, and case-control studies. Cancer incidence data were obtained from the French Network of CancerRegistries. A 10-year latency period was assumed.RESULTS: Among parous women 25 years of age and older, 14.1% breastfed for atleast 6 months per child born before 2006. As a result, 1,712 new breast cancercases (3.2% of all new breast cancer cases) were attributable to breastfeedingfor < 6 months per child, while actual breastfeeding practices prevented 765breast cancer cases. Furthermore, 411 new ovarian cancer cases (8.6% of all newovarian cancer cases) may be attributable to breastfeeding for < 6 months perchild, with breastfeeding preventing 163 ovarian cancer cases.CONCLUSIONS: The historically low breastfeeding prevalence and duration in Franceled to numerous avoidable cancer cases.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1015-2 PMID: 29464426
