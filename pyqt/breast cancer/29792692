Engineered systems such as CRISPR have been developed to rid a cell ofRNAs. Here, we show that a small molecule can recruit a nuclease to a specifictranscript, triggering its destruction. A small molecule that selectively bindsthe oncogenic microRNA(miR)-96 hairpin precursor was appended with a short 2'-5' poly(A) oligonucleotide. The conjugate locally activated endogenous, latentribonuclease (RNase L), which selectively cleaved the miR-96 precursor in cancer cells in a catalytic and sub-stoichiometric fashion. Silencing miR-96 derepressedpro-apoptotic FOXO1 transcription factor, triggering apoptosis in breast cancer, but not healthy breast, cells. These results demonstrate that small molecules canbe programmed to selectively cleave RNA via nuclease recruitment and has broadimplications.DOI: 10.1021/jacs.8b01233 PMID: 29792692
