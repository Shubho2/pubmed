The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for UEDVT and the rates of recurrence and bleeding in a real-worldsetting.METHODS: Retrospective review of consecutive patients assessed forcancer-associated UEDVT. Outcome measures were recurrent venous thromboembolism(VTE), and major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB). Risk factorsfor recurrent VTE and bleeding were assessed.RESULTS: Mean duration of follow-up was 7.2 months. Two hundred cases wereidentified; 69% were associated with a central line. Non-line associated UEDVToccurred more frequently in the setting of breast cancer, lung cancer anddocumented local mass effect. The incidence of recurrent VTE was 18.5%, of which 14 (37.8%) were ipsilateral UEDVT. The risk of recurrence is higher with malegender (HR 2.0, 95% CI; 1.0-4.0). Major and CRNMB occurred in 1% and 11.5%,respectively. Concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent was associated with ahigher risk of CRNMB compared to anticoagulant therapy alone (HR 3.9, 95% CI;1.4-10.7).CONCLUSIONS: Presence of a venous catheter was the primary risk factor for UEDVT,however, extrinsic compression by local tumour may be just as important for some cancer types. Furthermore, the majority of recurrent events did not occur in the same upper limb suggesting that UEDVT may be predictive of increased thromboticrisk rather than just a local effect of catheters.Copyright © 2018.
