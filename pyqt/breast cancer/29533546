Those cells can be found in thewhole female reproductive system: in the vagina, uterus, oviducts and ovaries,mammary glands and also in the placenta. In our review, we aim at complete andtransparent revision of the current knowledge of telocytes' localization andfunction, enriched by the analysis of the possible future direction ofdevelopment of their clinical applications. The function of telocytes in thereproductive system has not been fully elucidated yet; however, many researchers point at their role in the regulation of local microenvironment, myogeniccontractile mechanism, bioelectrical signaling, immunomodulation and regulationof blood flow. Additionally, previous research suggests that telocytes might act as sex hormone level sensors and are connected with pregnancy maintenance. As themorphology and number of those cells change under pathological conditions, suchas pre-eclampsia, endometriosis and ovarian failure, there is a chance that they may contribute to therapy of abovementioned conditions. The impact of telocyteson stem cells and angiogenesis has been proven in many organs, and may be useful in regenerative medicine of the female reproductive system. A recently foundconnection between the proliferation rate of breast cancer cells and stromalcells like telocytes might be a step forward to the management of mammary glandneoplasms.DOI: 10.17219/acem/68845 PMID: 29533546
