Box 523, 23000 Beni-Mellal, Morocco.The present study attempts to investigate the cytotoxic activity of ethanol andethyl acetate extracts of the Moroccan Berberis vulgaris and its major component berberine, together with exploring their antioxidant properties. It also consistsof studying the combination effect of berberine andS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a nitric oxide (NO) donor, against thehuman breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7). Using the MTT assay, we report adifferential cytotoxic effect of ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts since theethanol extract is more cytotoxic than the ethyl acetate one, withIC50 = 3.54 μg/mL and 596.71 μg/mL, respectively. Interestingly, no cytotoxiceffect was observed against normal cells. Furthermore, these extracts showed aremarkable antioxidant activity as measured by the DPPH free radicals scavenging assay. In fact, the IC50 values are 69.65 μg/mL and 77.75 μg/mL for the ethanoland ethyl acetate extracts, respectively. In addition, several concentrations of berberine, when combined with the NO donor used at IC30, induced a synergisticcytotoxic activity at concentrations ranging from 8.40 μM to 33.60 μM, asrevealed by the combination index values, using the Chou-Talalay method. However,at the other concentrations tested, an antagonistic effect was observed. Theobserved cytotoxicity was related to apoptosis induction as demonstrated by theannexin-V-streptavidin FITC-staining analysis.DOI: 10.1155/2018/3018498 PMCID: PMC5817274PMID: 29805448
