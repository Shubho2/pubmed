[Epub ahead of print]T2-hypointense rim of breast mass lesions on magnetic resonance images:Radiologic-pathologic correlation.Nakashima K(1), Uematsu T(1), Sugino T(2), Takahashi K(3), Nishimura S(3),Tadokoro Y(3), Hayashi T(3).Author information: (1)Department of Breast Imaging and Intervention, Shizuoka Cancer CenterHospital, Shizuoka, Japan.(2)Department of Pathology, Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan.(3)Department of Breast Surgery, Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital, Shizuoka,Japan.We investigated the radiologic-pathologic correlation of a strong hypointense rimon T2-weighted images (T2-hypo-rim) surrounding breast mass lesions and evaluatedits clinical significance. We retrospectively reviewed 3503 consecutive breastmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. The T2-hypo-rim was defined as aborder of strong hypointensity compared with the fat signal on fat-suppressedT2-weighted images. Detected lesions with T2-hypo-rim were classified as a solid or cystic mass with MRI and correlated with histopathologic findings. Sixty-twomasses (2%; 34 solid, 28 cystic) with T2-hypo-rim were detected [44 breastcancers, 18 benign lesions, including 15 (24%) papillary tumors]. Patients withcancer were significantly older than those with benign lesions (P = .002). Breastcancers were significantly larger than benign masses (P = .023). In 49 of 62lesions (24 solid and 16 cystic cancers; three solid and six cystic benignmasses), the rims were accurately correlated with the histopathologic findings.All malignant and benign cystic masses exhibited hemosiderin deposits in the cystwalls. However, 22 of 24 solid cancers and no solid benign masses exhibitedhemosiderin at the tumor periphery (92% and 0%, respectively, P < .001). Inaddition, a thick fibrous capsule was present in nine (38%) of 24 solid cancersand none of the solid benign lesions. Strong T2-hypo-rims mostly correlated with hemosiderin deposits and/or sometimes fibrous capsules. Although the rims couldnot distinguish malignant from benign cystic lesions, they indicated malignancyin solid mass lesions on MRI. Additionally, the rims often indicated papillarytumors.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13068 PMID: 29785726
