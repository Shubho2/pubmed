Electronic address:nfortunati@cittadellasalute.to.it.AIMS: Interaction of Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) with estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells has a protective role against estrogen exposure. No specific membrane receptor for SHBG had been identified by now, but a putative interactionof SHBG with extracellular matrix associated-proteins (e.g. fibulins) wassuggested. In this study we investigated the expression of fibulins, theirfunctional relationship with SHBG and involvement in behavior ofestrogen-sensitive breast cancer.MAIN METHODS: Gene expression of fibulins was performed by Real time-PCR on twoestrogen-sensitive breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T47D. Fibulin-1 proteinexpression and localization were determined by Western blot andimmunofluorescence. SHBG interaction with-fibulin-1 was assessed by GST-pull downassay. MCF-7 cell growth and gene expression, after fibulin-1 silencing by siRNA,were evaluated. Finally, the expression of fibulin-1 was correlated to clinicaland pathological data of 21 breast cancer tissue samples.KEY FINDINGS: Fibulin-1 was expressed in both cell lines and it was increased by estradiol. SHBG interacted with fibulin-1C; proteins co-localized at MCF-7 cellmembranes and SHBG localization at membranes disappeared after silencingfibulin-1. Fibulin-1 silencing, moreover, generated MCF-7 cells unresponsive toestradiol and SHBG and characterized by increased proliferation. Finally, inbreast cancer tissue samples expressing fibulin-1 the proliferation index wassignificantly lower than in fibulin-1 negative samples.SIGNIFICANCE: Fibulin-1 interacts with SHBG, it is associated with a lessaggressive behavior of breast cancer cells and correlates to a better prognosisof the tumor.Copyright © 2018.
