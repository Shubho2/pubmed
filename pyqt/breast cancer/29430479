Accurate applications of stress-strainrelationships of tissue within the breast can improve the accuracy ofbiomechanical models that attempt to simulate breast deformations. Reportedstiffness values for adipose, glandular, and cancerous tissue types vary greatly.Variations in reported stiffness properties have been attributed to differencesin testing methodologies and assumptions, measurement errors, and naturalinterpatient differences in tissue elasticity. Therefore, the ability todetermine patient-specific in vivo breast tissue properties would be advantageousfor these procedural applications. While some in vivo elastography methods arenot quantitative and others do not measure material properties under deformation conditions that are appropriate to the application of concern, in this study, we developed an elasticity estimation method that is performed using deformationsrepresentative of supine therapeutic procedures. More specifically,reconstruction of mechanical properties appropriate for the standard-of-caresupine lumpectomy was performed by iteratively fitting two anatomical imagesbefore and after deformations taking place in the supine breast configuration.The method proposed is workflow-friendly, quantitative, and uses a noncontact,gravity-induced deformation source.DOI: 10.1117/1.JMI.5.1.015003 PMCID: PMC5803550 [Available on 2019-02-08]PMID: 29430479
