Methods: The clinical data of 72 patients with local-regional recurrence who had undergone breast-conserving therapy in Tianjin Cancer Hospital from February 2001to December 2009 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. These patients weredivided into axillary lymph node positive group (23 cases) and negative group (49cases), according to their axillary lymph node status. Results: Among 72patients, 21 cases were local recurrence, 35 cases were regional recurrence, and 16 cases were local-regional recurrence. In the axillary lymph node positivegroup, 7 cases were local recurrence, 10 cases were regional recurrence, 6 cases were local-regional recurrence. In the axillary lymph node negative group, 14cases were local recurrence, 25 cases were regional recurrence, 10 cases werelocal-regional recurrence. There was no significant difference between these two groups (P=0.807). Moreover, no significant differences of the age, recurrentsite, estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) status, humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) status, disease-free period, local andsystemic therapeutic effect, non-distant metastasis survival between these twogroups were observed (P>0.05). However, the overall survival of axillary lymphnode positive group after recurrence was significantly lower than that ofnegative group (P=0.014). Cox multivariate analysis showed that recurrent site isan independent prognostic factor of disease-free survival of patients withregional recurrence after breast-conserving surgery (OR=2.050, P=0.002). Theaxillary lymph node status and recurrent site were independent prognostic factorsof overall survival of these patients (OR=3.469, P=0.003; OR=3.676, P<0.001).Conclusions: Axillary lymph node status is an independent factor of overallsurvival of patients with regional recurrence after breast-conserving surgery,but it is marginally related with their non-distant metastasis survival.Publisher: 目的：探讨初次保乳手术治疗时腋窝淋巴结状态对乳腺癌患者局部区域复发后预后的影响。方法：收集天津市肿瘤医院2001年2月至2009年12月期间收治的72例乳腺癌保乳术后局部区域复发患者的临床资料。根据患者初次保乳手术腋窝淋巴结状态分为腋窝淋巴结阳性组(23例)和阴性组(49例)，比较两组患者的临床病理特征和远期生存情况，进行局部区域复发后预后影响因素分析。 结果：72例患者中，局部复发21例，区域复发35例，局部和区域同时复发16例。腋窝淋巴结阳性组局部复发7例，区域复发10例，局部＋区域复发6例；阴性组局部复发14例，区域复发25例，局部＋区域复发10例。两组差异无统计学意义(P＝0.807)。腋窝淋巴结阳性组和阴性组的患者年龄、复发部位、雌激素受体(ER)和(或)孕激素受体(PR)状态、人表皮生长因子受体2(HER－2)状态、无病间期、局部治疗和全身治疗差异均无统计学意义(均P>0.05)。初次保乳手术腋窝淋巴结阳性组与阴性组的无远处转移生存率差异无统计学意义(P＝0.175)，复发后总生存率明显低于阴性组(P＝0.014)。Cox比例风险模型多因素分析显示，复发部位是初次保乳手术局部区域复发后无远处转移生存的独立影响因素(OR＝2.050，P＝0.002)，腋窝淋巴结状态和复发部位是初次保乳手术局部区域复发后总生存的独立影响因素(OR＝3.469，P＝0.003；OR＝3.676，P<0.001)。结论：初次保乳手术时腋窝淋巴结状态是局部区域复发后患者总生存的独立影响因素，但对局部区域复发后患者的无远处转移生存无明显影响。.PMID: 29860761  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
