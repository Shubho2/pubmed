Safety, tolerability, andPK activity in each cohort were reviewed before escalating to the next dose. PKwas determined by mass spectrometry. Adverse events (AEs) were graded accordingto the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Objectivetumor response was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors(RECIST) v1.1.Results: Most common causally related AEs were diarrhea (35.6%),fatigue (31.1%), and nausea (22.2%), and seven patients had grade ≥3 AEs. Threepatients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity: one each at 150 mg BID (abnormalhepatic function), 400 mg BID (diarrhea and elevated liver function tests), and600 mg BID (diarrhea), and all were reversible. The maximum tolerated dose wasnot reached. Partial response was confirmed in one patient, who also haddecreased tumor marker Ca15.3. Four patients had stable disease at 12 months'follow-up.Conclusions: AZD9496 is well tolerated with an acceptable safetyprofile, showing evidence of prolonged disease stabilization in heavilypretreated patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.
