While several lipid signaturesassociated with breast cancer aggressiveness have been identified, acomprehensive lipidomic analysis specifically targeting the triple-negativesubtype of breast cancer (TNBC) may be required to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for this most aggressive subtype of breast cancer that still lacks effective therapies. In this current study, our global LC-MS-basedlipidomics platform was able to measure 684 named lipids across 15 lipid classes in 70 TNBC tumors. Multivariate survival analysis found that higher levels ofsphingomyelins were significantly associated with better disease-free survival inTNBC patients. Furthermore, analysis of publicly available gene expressiondatasets identified that decreased production of ceramides and increasedaccumulation of sphingoid base intermediates by metabolic enzymes were associatedwith better survival outcomes in TNBC patients. Our LC-MS lipidomics profiling ofTNBC tumors has, for the first time, identified sphingomyelins as a potentialprognostic marker and implicated enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism ascandidate therapeutic targets that warrant further investigation.DOI: 10.3390/metabo8030041 PMID: 30011843
