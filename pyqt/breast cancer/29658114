[Epub ahead of print]Proton pump inhibitor use and cancer mortality.Tvingsholm SA(1), Dehlendorff C(2), Østerlind K(3), Friis S(2), Jäättelä M(1).Author information: (1)Cell Death and Metabolism, Center for Autophagy, Recycling and Disease, DanishCancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.(2)Statistics and Pharmocoepidemiology, Danish Cancer Society Research Center,Copenhagen, Denmark.(3)Department of Oncology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used as a supplement to cancertherapy. Yet, their effect on cancer mortality is largely unknown. Using datafrom Danish nationwide registries and Cox models regressing of both propensityscores and drug use, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidenceintervals (CIs) for cancer-specific and noncancer death among PPI users (≥2prescriptions within six months after diagnosis; n = 36,066) compared withnonusers (<2 prescriptions, n = 311,853) or users of histamine H2 -receptorantagonists (H2 RA; n = 5,152). Adjusted HRs for cancer-specific mortality among postdiagnostic PPI users as compared with nonusers or H2 RA users were 1.29 (95% CI, 1.27-1.32) and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.10-1.20), respectively. HRs for cancermortality associated with PPI use were highest for ovarian (1.35; 95% CI,1.20-1.52) and lowest for esophageal cancer (0.91; 95% CI, 0.81-1.04). Theassociations were stronger among new PPI users after cancer diagnosis, indicatingpotential confounding. To test the effect of PPIs on tumor growth in a modelsystem free for confounding factors, we investigated the effect of pantoprazoleon tumor growth in mice. Pantoprazole (5 mg/kg/day) enhanced tumor growth(p = 0.033) and reduced the antitumor activity of gemcitabine (p = 0.008) infibrosarcoma-bearing Balb/c mice, but not in immunodeficient Balb/c nude mice. Inbreast carcinoma-bearing FVB/N mice, pantoprazole had no effect on tumor growthalone but it reduced the life-prolonging effect of doxorubicin significantly(p = 0.007). Taken together, these data raise concerns about the increasing useof PPIs and calls for further studies addressing their safety among cancerpatients.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31529 PMID: 29658114
