Compounds 4m and 7bwere able to provoke apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, evidenced by theup-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2, besides boosting caspase-3levels. Hybrid 4m induced a fourfold increase in the percentage of cells atSub-G₁, with concurrent arrest in G₂-M phase by 2.5-folds. Furthermore, hybrid 4mresulted in a sixfold increase in the percentage of annexin V-FITC positiveapoptotic MDA-MB-231 cells as compared with the control. Moreover, the cytotoxic activities of the active conjugates were assessed towards two nontumorigenic celllines (breast MCF-10A and lung WI-38) where both conjugates 4m and 7b displayedmean tumor selectivity index: 9.6 and 13.9, respectively. Finally, several ADMEdescriptors were predicted for the active conjugates via a theoretical kineticstudy.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23061420 PMID: 29895744
