We propose that the problem with exercise behavior in MS (i.e.lack of broad or increasing participation by people with MS despite evidence ofmeaningful benefits) might be ameliorated through the inclusion of behaviorchange theory in the design of exercise programs and promotion efforts, as hasbeen undertaken in other populations such as breast cancer survivors. This paper reviews Social Cognitive Theory as an example approach for informinginterventions for increasing exercise and physical activity behavior outside ofMS and provides an overview of current knowledge regarding the application ofthis theory for physical activity in MS. We then outline future researchnecessary for informing trials that design, implement, and test theory-basedinterventions for physical activity promotion in MS. If theories of behaviorchange are adopted for informing exercise and physical activity research in MS,we can take a major step forward in addressing the problem of exercise andphysical activity participation that has plagued the field for more than 25years.DOI: 10.1177/2055217318786745 PMCID: PMC6077908PMID: 30090642
