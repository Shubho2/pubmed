Recent breakthroughs in molecular biology aided development of genomicassays such as EndoPredict, which have been shown to provide excellent prognosticinformation. The current study investigated the impact of EndoPredict Clinical(EPClin), a composite of clinicopathological data and EndoPredict score, onchemotherapy recommendations based on NPI.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 120 patients with oestrogen receptor-positive(ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer whowere candidates for post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy at a single tertiarycentre were included. Both NPI and EPClin were applied to all patients. NPIdifferentiated patients into groups with excellent/good prognosis (N=41; NPI≤3.4)or moderate/poor prognosis (N=79; NPI >3.4). The latter were considered foradjuvant chemotherapy.RESULTS: There was discordance in results of 31% of cases; 35% of thepatients/candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy according to NPI were reclassified as being at low risk of recurrence by EPClin.CONCLUSION: Genomic profiling using EPClin reduces the potential need foradjuvant chemotherapy in women with ER+/HER2- breast cancer who are candidatesfor chemotherapy according to the NPI.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12782 PMID: 30061244  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
