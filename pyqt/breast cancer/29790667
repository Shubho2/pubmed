[Epub ahead of print]Differences in cancer survival among white and black cancer patients by presence of diabetes mellitus: Estimations based on SEER-Medicare-linked data resource.Lam C(1), Cronin K(1), Ballard R(2), Mariotto A(1).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute,Rockville, MD, USA.(2)Office of Disease Prevention, Office of the Director, National Institutes ofHealth, Rockville, MD, USA.Diabetes prevalence and racial health disparities in the diabetic population are increasing in the US. Population-based cancer-specific survival estimates forcancer patients with diabetes have not been assessed. The Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linkage provided data oncancer-specific deaths and diabetes prevalence among 14 separate cohortsrepresenting 1 068 098 cancer patients ages 66 +  years diagnosed between 2000and 2011 in 17 SEER areas. Cancer-specific survival estimates were calculated by diabetes status adjusted by age, stage, comorbidities, and cancer treatment, and stratified by cancer site and sex with whites without diabetes as the referencegroup. Black patients had the highest diabetes prevalence particularly amongwomen. Risks of cancer deaths were increased across most cancer sites forpatients with diabetes regardless of race. Among men the largest effect of havingdiabetes on cancer-specific deaths were observed for black men diagnosed withNon-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (HR = 1.53, 95%CI = 1.33-1.76) and prostate cancer(HR = 1.37, 95%CI = 1.32-1.42). Diabetes prevalence was higher for black females compared to white females across all 14 cancer sites and higher for most siteswhen compared to white and black males. Among women the largest effect of having diabetes on cancer-specific deaths were observed for black women diagnosed withcorpus/uterus cancer (HR = 1.66, 95%CI = 1.54-1.79), Hodgkin lymphoma (HR = 1.62,95%CI = 1.02-2.56) and breast ER+ (HR = 1.39, 95%CI = 1.32-1.47). Theco-occurrence of diabetes and cancer significantly increases the risk of cancerdeath. Our study suggests that these risks may vary by cancer site, and indicatesthe need for future research to address racial and sex disparities and enhanceunderstanding how prevalent diabetes may affect cancer deaths.© 2018 The Authors.
