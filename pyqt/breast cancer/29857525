Most breast cancers arise from themilk-producing cells that are characterized by aberrant cellular, molecular, and epigenetic translation. By understanding the underlying molecular disruptionsleading to the origin of cancer, we might be able to design novel strategies for more efficacious treatments or, ambitiously, divert the cancerous process. It is an established reality that full-term pregnancy in a young woman provides alifetime reduction in breast cancer risk, whereas delay in full-term pregnancyincreases short-term breast cancer risk and the probability of latent breastcancer development. Hormonal activation of the p53 protein (encode by the TP53gene) in the mammary gland at a critical time in pregnancy has been identified asone of the most important determinants of whether the mammary gland developslatent breast cancer. This review discusses what is known about the protectiveinfluence of female hormones in young parous women, with a specific focus on the opportune role of wild-type p53 reprogramming in mammary cell differentiation.The importance of p53 as a protector or perpetrator in hormone-dependent breastcancer, resistance to treatment, and recurrence is also explored.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10060172 PMCID: PMC6025368PMID: 29857525
