As aconsequence, about 20% of all breast cancer cases are detected in this early insitu stage. Some ductal carcinoma in situ cases will progress to invasive breast cancer, while other cases are likely to have an indolent biological behavior. Thepresence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is seen as a promising prognostic and predictive marker in invasive breast cancer, mainly in HER2-positive andtriple-negative subtypes. Here, we summarize the current understanding regarding immune infiltrates in invasive breast cancer and highlight recent observationsregarding the presence and potential clinical significance of such immuneinfiltrates in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ. The presence oftumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, their numbers, composition, and potentialrelationship with genomic status will be discussed. Finally, we propose that acombination of genetic and immune markers may better stratify ductal carcinoma insitu subtypes with respect to tumor evolution.DOI: 10.1038/s41379-018-0030-x PMID: 29463884
