Herein, an on-chip strategy is proposed that combinessize-based microfluidic cell isolation with multiple spectrally orthogonalsurface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis for in situ profiling of cellmembrane proteins and identification of cancer subpopulations. With the developedmicrofluidic chip, tumor cells are sieved from blood on the basis of sizediscrepancy. To enable multiplex phenotypic analysis, three kinds of spectrallyorthogonal SERS aptamer nanovectors are designed, providing individual cells withcomposite spectral signatures in accordance with surface protein expression.Next, to statistically demultiplex the complex SERS signature and profile thecellular proteomic phenotype, a revised classic least square algorithm isemployed to obtain the 3D phenotypic information at single-cell resolution.Combined with categorization algorithm partial least square discriminateanalysis, cells from different human breast cancer subtypes can be reliablyclassified with high sensitivity and selectivity. The results demonstrate thatthis platform can identify cancer subtypes with the spectral informationcorrelated to the clinically relevant surface receptors, which holds greatpotential for clinical cancer diagnosis and precision medicine.Â© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
