Reversetranscription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysiswere used to detect the mRNA and protein miR‑23a and PLK‑1 level. Cell viability,cell cycle, migration and invasion assasy, and in vivo tumorigenicity assay were used to investigate the effects of miR‑204. Further luciferase reporter assay wasused to explore the mechanisms contributing to miR‑204 effects. It was observedthat miR‑23a expression was upregulated and negatively associated with polo‑like kinase‑1 (PLK‑1) expression in human PC tissues. PLK‑1 was a direct target ofmiR‑23a in PC cells. Functional analysis demonstrated that miR‑23a overexpressionsuppressed cell proliferation, inhibited cell migration and invasion and promotedcell apoptosis in vitro. When PC cells were transfected with has‑miR‑23a PLK‑1was downregulated and its downstream molecules were deregulated, includingdecreased expression of B‑cell lymphoma‑2, cyclin B1 and vimentin, and increased expression of Bax and E‑cadherin. The inhibitory effect of miR‑23a on PC cellprogression was observed in vivo tumor xenografts. The results of the studysuggest that miR‑23a inhibits PC cell progression by directly targetingPLK‑1‑associated signaling and promoting miR‑23a expression may be a potentialmethod for treating patients with PC.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8941 PMCID: PMC6059658PMID: 29749476
