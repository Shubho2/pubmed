When administered as aboost, excellent low local recurrence rates were observed in long-term follow-up >5 years. Even in high-risk groups like triple-negative or locally advancedbreast cancers, IOERT contributes to long-term local control rates of more than90%. For selected low-risk groups, IOERT as PBI with 21 Gy seems to be a viabletreatment alternative to standard WBI. IOERT has been shown to be advantageousfor several reasons: Geographic misses are avoided due to direct visualization ofthe tumor bed; thus, a high single dose is delivered with utmost precision tosmall volumes, completely sparing the skin and ensuring good long-term cosmeticoutcome. Furthermore, high single doses seem to induce biological mechanisms withverifiable antitumor capability in in-vitro cell-line studies. In addition, IOERTmarkedly shortens the overall treatment time both in combination with (now mostlyhypofractionated) WBI or as a PBI in selected low-risk constellations.DOI: 10.1159/000489637 PMCID: PMC6062668 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 30069175
