China.The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of receptorinteracting protein 140 (RIP140) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and itsassociation with the prognosis of patients with TNBC. A total of 179 patientswith breast cancer were included in this study, with 41 cases of TNBC and 138cases of non-TNBC. Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting were used todetect the protein expression of RIP140 in the cancerous and paracanceroustissues, revealing that expression of RIP140 was increased in TNBC tissuescompared with non-TNBC tissues. High expression of RIP140 in breast cancer tissuewas associated with a poorer survival time than low RIP140 expression. Usinglentiviral transfection to downregulate RIP140 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells,the effects of RIP140 on the growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells was analyzed using subcutaneous tumors in BALB/c nude mice. Immunohistochemicalstaining using a Ki-67 antibody in subcutaneous tumor tissue was used to assessthe proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. The short hairpin RNA-mediateddownregulation of RIP140 in MDA-MB-231 cells suppressed the growth and theproliferation of subcutaneous tumors in BALB/c nude mice. Downregulation ofRIP140 in breast cancer cells may therefore inhibit the growth and theproliferation of these cells, and may provide a therapeutic target for TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8434 PMCID: PMC5958796PMID: 29844812
