The Breast Cancer Genetics Referral Screening Tool (B-RST™)was created and validated to easily identify individuals at increased risk forhereditary breast and ovarian cancer for referral to cancer genetics services.The purpose of this study was to revise B-RST™ to maximize sensitivity againstBRCA1/2 mutation status.METHODS: We analyzed pedigrees of 277 individuals who had undergone BRCA1/2testing to determine modifications to the B-RST™ 2.0 algorithm that wouldmaximize sensitivity for mutations, while maintaining simplicity. We usedMcNemar's chi-square test to compare validation measures between the revisedversion (3.0) and the 2.0 version.RESULTS: Algorithmic changes made to B-RST™ 2.0 increased the sensitivity againstBRCA1/2 mutation analysis from 71.1 to 94.0% (P < 0.0001). While specificitydecreased, all screen-positive individuals were appropriate for cancer geneticsreferral, the primary purpose of the tool.CONCLUSION: Despite calls for BRCA1/2 population screening, there remains acritical need to identify those most at risk who should receive cancer geneticsservices. B-RST™ version 3.0 demonstrates high sensitivity for BRCA1/2 mutations,yet remains a simple and quick screening tool for at-risk individuals.DOI: 10.1038/s41436-018-0020-x PMID: 29740170
