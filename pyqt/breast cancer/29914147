Its role in cancer has been debated for years. Our aim is to determineif thiamine can convert the cellular metabolic state of breast cancer cells from anaerobic to aerobic, thus reducing their growth. (2) Methods: Breast cancer(MCF7) and non-tumorigenic (MCF10A) cell lines were treated with various doses ofthiamine and assessed for changes in cell growth. The mechanism of thisrelationship was identified through the measurement of enzymatic activity andmetabolic changes. (3) Results: A high dose of thiamine reduced cellproliferation in MCF7 (63% decrease, p < 0.0001), but didn&rsquo;t affectapoptosis and the cell-cycle profile. Thiamine had a number of effects in MCF7;it (1) reduced extracellular lactate levels in growth media, (2) increasedcellular pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activities and the baseline and maximumcellular oxygen consumption rates, and (3) decreased non-glycolyticacidification, glycolysis, and glycolytic capacity. MCF10A cells preferredmitochondrial respiration instead of glycolysis. In contrast, MCF7 cells weremore resistant to mitochondrial respiration, which may explain the inhibitoryeffect of thiamine on their proliferation. (4) Conclusions: The treatment of MCF7breast cancer cells with 1 &mu;g/mL and 2 &mu;g/mL of thiamine for 24 hsignificantly reduced their proliferation. This reduction is associated with areduction in glycolysis and activation of the PDH complex in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23061464 PMID: 29914147
