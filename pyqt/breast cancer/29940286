Electronic address: gdtrc@163.com.Signal sequence receptor subunit γ (SSR3), an SSR family member, is heavilyinvolved in cell growth and differentiation and closely associated with manytumor types. However, the role of this protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In this study, we used data from public databases to analyzeSSR3 expression in HCC. We subjected 20 pairs of fresh-frozen tissues toquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to investigate SSR3expression. We also subjected 95 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded HCC tissues toimmunohistochemistry to detect SSR3 expression and determine the clinicalsignificance of SSR3 expression in HCC. Bioinformatics analysis and qRT-PCRresults showed that compared with that in adjacent normal liver tissues, SSR3 washighly expressed in HCC tissues. High SSR3 expression was positively correlatedwith tumor size (P<.01), cancer embolus (P=.01), TNM stages (P=.02) anddifferentiation grades (P<.01). Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazardsanalyses indicated that high SSR3 expression was significantly associated withpoor survival in HCC patients and that SSR3 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in HCC patients. In conclusion, SSR3 acts as an oncogene in HCC and can therefore serve as a biomarker for the prognoses of HCC patients.Copyright © 2018.
