Pyruvate kinase muscle isozymeM2 (PKM2), encoded by PKM gene, has emerged as a key oncoprotein in breastcancer. Yet, the regulatory mechanism of PKM2 is still unexplored. Here, wereport that HBXIP can upregulate PKM2 to accelerate proliferation of estrogenreceptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry analysis using breastcancer tissue microarray uncovered a positive association between the expression of HBXIP and PKM2. We also discovered that PKM2 expression was positively relatedwith HBXIP expression in clinical breast cancer patients by real-time PCR assay. Interestingly, in ER+ breast cancer cells, HBXIP was capable of upregulating PKM2expression at mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner, as well asincreasing the activity of PKM promoter. Mechanistically, HBXIP could stimulatePKM promoter through binding to the -779/-579 promoter region involvingco-activation of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1). In function, cell viability, EdU, colony formation, and xenograft tumor growth assays showed that HBXIPcontributed to accelerating cell proliferation through PKM2 in ER+ breast cancer.Collectively, we conclude that HBXIP induces PKM2 through transcription factorE2F1 to facilitate ER+ breast cancer cell proliferation. We provide new evidence for the mechanism of transcription regulation of PKM2 in promotion of breastcancer progression.DOI: 10.1038/s41401-018-0015-9 PMID: 29925919
