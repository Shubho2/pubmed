Patients were followed until September 2015. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival(PFS), post-progression survival (PPS) and adverse events. Efficacy findings wereadjusted according to demographics.RESULTS: In total, 216 patients receiving eribulin monotherapy (n = 101), taxane monotherapy (n = 73) or taxane plus bevacizumab (n = 42) were followed for amedian time of 15.4 months. Median OS, PFS and PPS were 22.3, 8.1 and 14 monthsin the eribulin monotherapy group; 13.2, 3.6 and 7.6 months in the taxanemonotherapy group; and 12.9, 5.7 and 6.3 months, in the taxane plus bevacizumabgroup, respectively. The incidence of neutropenia was 67.3, 41.1 and 16.7%, andthe incidence of grade 4 neutropenia was 1.0, 8.2 and 7.1% in the eribulinmonotherapy, taxane monotherapy and taxane plus bevacizumab groups, respectively.One patient (1.0%) discontinued eribulin and 18 patients (15.7%) discontinuedtaxane-based regimens because of adverse events.CONCLUSION: In Japanese MBC patients in a real-world setting, eribulin showed asurvival benefit and tolerability similar to that in previous reports.© 2018 The Authors.
