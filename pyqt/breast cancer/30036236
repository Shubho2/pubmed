A patient group advocacy led to theimplementation of laws to increase the awareness of breast tissue density and to improve access to supplemental imaging in many states. Given limited evidenceabout best practices, variation exists in several characteristics of adoptedpolicies.OBJECTIVE: To identify which characteristics of state-level policies with regard to dense breast tissue were associated with increased use of downstream breastultrasound.RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a retrospective series of monthly cross-sections ofscreening mammography procedures before and after implementation of laws.SUBJECTS: A sample of 13,481,554 screening mammography procedures extracted from the MarketScan Research database performed between 2007 and 2014 on privatelyinsured women aged 40-64 years that resided in a state that had implementedrelevant legislation during that period.MEASURES: The outcome was an indicator of whether breast ultrasound imagingfollowed a screening mammography procedure within 30 days. The main independentvariables were policy characteristics indicators.RESULTS: Notification of patients about issues surrounding increased breastdensity was associated with increased follow-up by ultrasound by 1.02 percentage points (P=0.016). Some policy characteristics such as the explicit suggestion of supplemental imaging or mandated coverage of supplemental imaging by healthinsurance augmented that effect. Other policy characteristics moderated theeffect.CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous effect of state legislation with regard to densebreast tissue on screening mammography follow-up by ultrasound may be explainedby specific and unique characteristics of the approaches taken by a variety ofstates.DOI: 10.1097/MLR.0000000000000967 PMID: 30036236
