Whetherbreast-conservation can be safely offered to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers isdebatable.METHODS: The study comprised a cohort of women with invasive breast cancerdiagnosed <50 years and treated between 1970 and 2003 in 10 Dutch centers.Germline DNA for BRCA1/2 testing of most-prevalent mutations (covering âˆ¼61%) was mainly derived from paraffin-blocks. Survival analyses were performed taking intoaccount competing risks.RESULTS: In noncarriers (N = 5820), as well as in BRCA1 (N = 191) and BRCA2 (N = 70) mutation carriers, approximately half of the patients receivedbreast-conserving therapy. Patients receiving mastectomy followed by radiotherapyhad prognostically worse tumor characteristics and more often received systemictherapy. After adjustment for these potential confounders, patients who received breast-conserving therapy had a similar overall survival compared with patientswho received mastectomy, both in noncarriers (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.95,confidence interval [CI] = 0.85-1.07, P = 0.41) and BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR =0.80, CI = 0.42-1.51, P = 0.50). Numbers for BRCA2 were insufficient to drawconclusions. The rate of local recurrences after breast-conserving therapy didnot differ between BRCA1 carriers (10-year risk = 7.3%) and noncarriers (10-year risk = 7.9%).CONCLUSION: Our results, together with the available literature, providereassurance that breast-conserving therapy is a safe local treatment option tooffer to BRCA1 mutation carriers with invasive breast cancer.DOI: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000002804 PMID: 29727326
