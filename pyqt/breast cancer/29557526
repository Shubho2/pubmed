The aim ofthis study was to explore whether miRNAs from the miR-106a-363 cluster can bedetected in the circulation of BC patients and whether these miRNAs can serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers.METHODS: The expression of 12 miRNAs from the miR-106a-363 cluster was evaluated using qRT-PCR in 400 plasma samples (from 200 BC patients and 200 healthycontrols (HCs)) and 406 serum samples (from 204 BC patients and 202 HCs) via athree-phase study. The identified miRNAs were further examined in tissues (32paired breast tissues), plasma exosomes (from 32 BC patients and 32 HCs), andserum exosomes (from 32 BC patients and 32 HCs).RESULTS: Upregulated levels of four plasma miRNAs (miR-106a-3p, miR-106a-5p,miR-20b-5p, and miR-92a-2-5p) and four serum miRNAs (miR-106a-5p, miR-19b-3p,miR-20b-5p, and miR-92a-3p) were identified and validated in BC. A plasma 4-miRNApanel and a serum 4-miRNA panel were constructed to discriminate BC patients fromHCs. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of the plasmapanel were 0.880, 0.902, and 0.858, and those of the serum panel were 0.910,0.974, and 0.949 for the training, testing, and external validation phases,respectively. Two overlapping miRNAs (miR-106a-5p and miR-20b-5p) wereconsistently upregulated in BC tissues. Except for the expression of theplasma-derived exosomal miR-20b-5p, the expression patterns of exosomal miRNAswere concordant between plasma and serum, indicating the potential use ofexosomal miRNAs as biomarkers.CONCLUSION: We identified four plasma miRNAs and four serum miRNAs from themiR-106a-363 cluster as promising novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of BC.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4757-3 PMCID: PMC5999170PMID: 29557526
