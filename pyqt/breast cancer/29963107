Correlations between expression levels andclinicopathological features were analyzed. Prognostic values for combineddetection in TNBC following NACT were evaluated.Results: In pre-NACT specimens, LAG-3 expression showed a significant associationwith pathological complete response (pCR, p=0.038) and was correlated with PD-1(p<0.001) and PD-L1 (p=0.008). In post-NACT specimens, high expression of LAG-3showed significant effects on nodal status (p=0.023) and PD-1 (p<0.001). Theexpression of immune markers on TILs significantly increased following NACT.Multivariate analysis indicated that only nodal status (odds ratio [OR], 0.226;95% confidence interval [CI], 0.079-0.644; p=0.005) and high quantities ofCD8+TILs (OR, 3.186; 95% CI, 1.314-7.721; p=0.010) are independent predictors of pCR. Nodal status (hazard ratio [HR], 2.666; 95% CI, 1.271-5.594; p=0.010),CD8+TILs (HR, 0.313; 95% CI, 0.139-0.705; p=0.005), and the LAG-3-high/PD-L1-highgroup (HR, 2.829; 95% CI, 1.050-7.623; p=0.040) provided prognostic values forpatients with TNBC following NACT.Conclusion: CD8+TILs were sensitive predictive markers in response to NACT. High expression of LAG-3 in residual tissues, especially in combination with PD-L1,was associated with poor prognosis.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.124 PMCID: PMC6015973PMID: 29963107
