Mainly restricted to the nervous system in healthy adult, complexgangliosides such as GD3 and GD2 have been shown to be involved in aggressivenessand metastasis of neuro-ectoderm derived tumors such as melanoma andneuroblastoma. GD3 synthase (GD3S), the key enzyme that controls the biosynthesisof complex gangliosides, was shown to be over-expressed in Estrogen Receptor(ER)-negative breast cancer tumors, and associated with a decreased overallsurvival of patients. We previously demonstrated that GD3S expression inER-negative breast cancer cells induced a proliferative phenotype and anincreased tumor growth. In addition, our results clearly indicate that TumorNecrosis Factor (TNF) induced GD3S over-expression in breast cancer cells viaNFκB pathway. In this study, we analyzed the effect of TNF on gangliosidebiosynthesis and expression in breast cancer cells from different molecularsubtypes. We showed that TNF up-regulated the expression of GD3S in MCF-7 andHs578T cells, whereas no change was observed for MDA-MB-231. We also showed that TNF induced an increased expression of complex gangliosides at the cell surfaceof a small proportion of MCF-7 cells. These results demonstrate that TNFdifferentially regulates gangliosides expression in breast cancer cell lines and establish a possible link between inflammation at the tumor site environment,expression of complex gangliosides and tumor development.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196369 PMCID: PMC5919650PMID: 29698439  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
