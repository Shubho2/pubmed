[Epub ahead of print]Psychosocial predictors of mammography history among Chinese American womenwithout a recent mammogram.Miller BC(1), Sarma EA(1), Sun Y(1), Messina CR(1), Moyer A(1).Author information: (1)a Stony Brook University , Stony Brook , NY , USA.Chinese American women have lower rates of mammography screening compared withnon-Hispanic White women. Although the extent of perceived barriers, asconceptualized by the Health Belief Model, have been shown to distinguish betweencurrently non-adherent Chinese American women who have ever and never had amammogram, it is less clear which types of perceived barriers differentiate them.One hundred twenty-eight Chinese American women in the New York metropolitan areawho had not had a mammogram in the past year completed baseline assessments for amammography framing intervention study. Demographics, medical access variables,and perceived barriers to mammography (lack of access, lack of need forscreening, and modesty) were used to predict mammography history (ever versusnever screened). Fifty-five women (43%) reported having been screened at leastonce. A sequential logistic regression showed that English speaking ability andhaving health insurance significantly predicted mammography history. However,these control variables became non-significant when the three barrier factorswere included in the final model. Women who reported a greater lack of access(OR = 0.36, p < .05) and greater lack of need (OR = 0.27, p < .01) were lesslikely to be ever screeners. Unexpectedly, women who reported greater modestywere more likely to be ever screeners (OR = 4.78, p < .001). The results suggest that interventions for Chinese American women should identify and target specificperceived barriers with consideration of previous adherence.DOI: 10.1080/13557858.2018.1447653 PMID: 29506393
