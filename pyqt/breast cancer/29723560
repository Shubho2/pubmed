[Epub ahead of print]Associations Between Catecholaminergic and Serotonergic Genes and PersistentBreast Pain Phenotypes After Breast Cancer Surgery.Knisely MR(1), Conley YP(1), Kober KM(2), Smoot B(3), Paul SM(2), Levine JD(4),Miaskowski C(5).Author information: (1)School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.(2)Schools of Nursing, University of California, San Francisco, California.(3)Medicine, and University of California, San Francisco, California.(4)Medicine, and University of California, San Francisco, California;Dentistry,University of California, San Francisco, California.(5)Schools of Nursing, University of California, San Francisco, California.Electronic address: chris.miaskowski@ucsf.edu.Genetic variations in the catecholaminergic and serotonergic pathways maycontribute to the development and severity of persistent breast pain. However,investigations of these associations are limited. The purpose of this study wasto evaluate for associations between breast pain phenotypes and single nucleotidepolymorphisms among 15 genes involved in catecholaminergic and serotonergicneurotransmission. Women rated the presence and intensity of breast pain monthly for 6 months after breast cancer surgery. Distinct latent classes of patientswere identified using growth mixture modeling. Logistic regression analysesidentified significant differences between genotype or haplotype frequencies and the breast pain classes (ie, no breast pain [n = 96] vs mild breast pain[n = 141], moderate breast pain [n = 46], and severe breast pain [n = 27]).Polymorphisms in 5 genes were associated with membership in the mild pain class: ** beta-2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) rs2400707, beta adrenergic receptor kinase 2 (ADRBK2) HapA04, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A (HTR3A) rs10160548,solute-like carrier (SLC) family 6 member 2-noradrenaline transporter (SLC6A2)rs1566652, and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) rs11179000. Polymorphisms in 3genes were associated with membership in the moderate pain class:5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A) rs2296972, SLC6A2 rs17841327, and SLC6A3 rs403636. Polymorphisms in 3 genes were associated with membership in the severe pain class: COMT HPS haplotype, SLC family 6 member 2-noradrenaline transporter(SLC6A2) HapD01, and SLC family 6 member 3-noradrenaline transporter (SLC6A3)rs464049. The identification of these associations suggest possible underlyingmechanisms that play a role in the development and severity of persistent breast pain.PERSPECTIVE: Findings from this study of women with breast cancer suggestthat a number of catecholaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms may play a role inthe development and severity of persistent breast pain phenotypes after surgery.Copyright © 2018 The American Pain Society.
