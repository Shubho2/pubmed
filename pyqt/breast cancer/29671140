To inform patients wanting a lumpectomy, weaimed to develop a pilot project that communicated composite quality measure (QM)results using a '4-star' rating system. Two patient-centered QMs were included inthe model-reoperation rate (ROR) and cosmetic outcome (COSM).METHODS: A prospective database was reviewed for stage 0-3 patients undergoinginitial lumpectomy by three surgeons from 2010 to 2015. Self-reported COSM wasassessed by survey. Multivariate analyses were used to test for interactionsbetween surgeon and other variables known to influence RORs and COSMs. Models of surgeon profiling were developed that summed the ROR and COSM performance scores,then reported results using a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)star-type system. Functionality for a patient to 'weight' the importance of theratio of ROR:COSM before profiling was introduced.RESULTS: The unadjusted ROR for stage 1-3 patients for three surgeons was 9.5,13.0, and 16.3%, respectively (p = 0.179) [overall rate 10.4% (38/366)]. Afterrisk adjustment, differences between surgeons were observed for RORs, but notCOSMs. Overall, patients reported excellent, good, fair, and poor COSMs of 55,30, 11 and 4%, respectively. Composite star scores reflected differences inperformance by surgeon, which could increase, or even disappear, dependent on thepatient's weighting of the ROR:COSM ratio.CONCLUSION: Composite measures of performance can be developed that allowpatients to input their weighted preferences and values into surgeon profilingbefore they consider a destination of care for BCS.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6479-5 PMID: 29671140
