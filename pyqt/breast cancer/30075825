Whether it regulatesbreast cancer progression remains elusive. In this study, we found that miR-1284 was downregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines compared to normalcontrol cells. Moreover, we showed that overexpression of miR-1284 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells while promoting apoptosis. In terms of mechanism, we found that transcription factorZIC2 was a target of miR-1284 in breast cancer cells. Through luciferase reporterassay, we demonstrated their direct interaction. Besides, qRT-PCR and westernblot also indicated that miR-1284 overexpression inhibited the protein levels of ZIC2 in breast cancer cells. Moreover, we found that ZIC2 knockdown inhibited theproliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, whereas restorationof ZIC2 reversed the effects of miR-1284 on breast cancer cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that miR-1284 suppressed the proliferation, migrationand invasion of breast cancer cells via targeting ZIC2, which provided a newinsight on the development of therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.3727/096504018X15242763477504 PMID: 30075825
