LMTK3 acts as keybiomarker for ERα positive breast cancer and identified as novel drug target for breast cancer. Due to the absence of experimental reports, the computationalapproach has been followed to screen LMTK3 inhibitors from natural productcurcumin derivatives based on rational inhibitor design. The initial virtualscreening and re-docking resulted in identification of top three leads withfavorable binding energy and strong interactions in critical residues ofATP-binding cavity. ADME prediction confirmed the pharmacological activity of theleads with various properties. The stability and binding affinity of leads werewell refined in dynamic system from 25 ns MD simulations. The behavior of proteinmotion towards closure of ATP-binding cavity was evaluated based on eigenvectors by PCA. In addition, MM/PBSA calculations also confirmed the relative bindingfree energy of LMTK3-lead complexes in favor of the effective binding. From ourstudy, novel LMTK3 inhibitors tetrahydrocurcumin, curcumin 4,4'-diacetate, anddemethoxycurcumin have been proposed with inhibition mechanism. Furtherexperimental evaluation on reported lead candidates might prove its role inbreast cancer therapeutics.DOI: 10.1007/s13205-018-1239-6 PMCID: PMC5924428 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29719770
