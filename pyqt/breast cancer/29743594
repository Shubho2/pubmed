We capturedmultinucleated cells from triple-negative chemo-resistant breast cancers cells ina time frame, where they do not proliferate but rather significantly regulatetheir micro-environment. We show that oxidatively stressed MNCs inducechemo-resistance in vitro and in vivo by secreting VEGF and MIF. These factorsact through the RAS/MAPK pathway to induce chemo-resistance by upregulatinganti-apoptotic proteins. In MNCs, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS)stabilizes HIF-1α contributing to increase production of VEGF and MIF. Togetherthe data indicate, that the ROS-HIF-1α signaling axis is very crucial inregulation of chemo-resistance by MNCs. Targeting ROS-HIF-1α in future may helpto abrogate drug resistance in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0272-6 PMID: 29743594
