Due to growing availability of evidenced-basedinterventions for high FCR, valid and reliable brief measures of FCR are needed. This study aimed to validate the 6-item Cancer Worry Scale (CWS) and to establisha cut-off score for high FCR.METHODS: Participants in this study were 1033 cancer survivors and patientsrecruited as part of 5 existing studies on FCR involving patients and survivorswith gastro-intestinal stromal tumors, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer.De-identified data of the CWS, Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI), Impactof Event Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and EORTC-QLQ-C30 wereamalgamated for the analyses. Confirmatory factor analysis of the CWS wasperformed. Sensitivity and specificity were tested with the FCRI as goldstandard.RESULTS: Results confirmed that the 6-item version of the CWS maintained goodconstruct validity, convergent and divergent validity, and high internalconsistency (α 0.90). The optimal cut-off for the 6-item CWS was 9 versus 10using the 12 vs 13 FCRI-SF score (sensitivity 82%, specificity 83%) and the 15 vs16 FCRI-SF score (sensitivity 88%, specificity 73%). Using the highest FCRI-SFcut-off (21 vs 22), the optimal CWS cut-off was 11 vs 12 (sensitivity 88%,specificity 81%).CONCLUSIONS: The present results provide researchers and clinicians with a brief valid and reliable measure of FCR which is suitable for measuring FCR in cancerpatients and survivors.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4782 PMID: 29843189
