Here we show that in cancer cells NRF2 targets are selectively upregulated or repressed through a mutant p53-dependent mechanism. Mechanistically, mutantp53 interacts with NRF2, increases its nuclear presence and resides with NRF2 on selected ARE containing gene promoters activating the transcription of a specificset of genes while leading to the transcriptional repression of others. We showthat thioredoxin (TXN) is a mutant p53-activated NRF2 target with pro-survivaland pro-migratory functions in breast cancer cells under oxidative stress, while heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) is a mutant p53-repressed target displaying oppositeeffects. A gene signature of NRF2 targets activated by mutant p53 shows asignificant association with bad overall prognosis and with mutant p53 status in breast cancer patients. Concomitant inhibition of thioredoxin system withAuranofin and of mutant p53 with APR-246 synergizes in killing cancer cellsexpressing p53 gain-of-function mutants.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24974 PMCID: PMC5945496PMID: 29755668
