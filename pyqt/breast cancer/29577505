Epub 2018 Mar 25.Efficacy and safety of bilateral thoracic paravertebral blocks in outpatientbreast surgery.Head LK(1), Lui A(2), Boyd KU(1).Author information: (1)Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery,University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.(2)Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.Unilateral thoracic paravertebral blocks (TPVBs) have demonstrated reliableintraoperative analgesia, low postoperative pain scores, and an opioid-sparingeffect in breast cancer surgery. However, secondary to the perceived risk ofcomplications, bilateral TPVB have been less well accepted and are lessfrequently used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility ofusing bilateral TPVBs in outpatient surgery for patients undergoing bilateralmastectomy with immediate implant-based reconstruction. Electronic medicalrecords were retrospectively reviewed for patients receiving bilateral TPVBs for bilateral mastectomy with immediate implant-based reconstruction performed by asingle surgeon from September 2012 to September 2015. Records were reviewed forincidence of complications, time to discharge, and incidence of unplannedadmission or readmission. Clopper-Pearson method for binomial distribution wasused to calculate confidence intervals for proportions. Forty-five patientsundergoing bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction received bilateral TPVBs. There were 4 TPVB-related complications, all of which were symptomatichypotension or bradycardia (9%; 95% CI, 2%-21%). There was no incidence ofsymptomatic pneumothorax. Mean time to discharge readiness from thepostanesthesia care unit (PACU) was 1.9 hours (SD = 1.0). Overall, 91% (n = 29)of the 32 patients scheduled for day surgery were discharged home as planned.Mean time from entry to PACU to home discharge for day surgery patients (n = 32) and planned admissions (n = 13) was 5.9 hours (SD = 4.3) and 16.3 hours (SD =3.6), respectively. There was no incidence of readmission following discharge.Bilateral TPVBs can safely facilitate day surgery in carefully selected patients undergoing bilateral mastectomy with immediate implant-based reconstruction.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13008 PMID: 29577505
