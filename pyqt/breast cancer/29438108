Although the molecular basis for the crosstalk betweentumor and immune cells is an area of active investigation, whether host-specific germline variants can dictate immunosuppressive mechanisms has remained achallenge to address. A commonly occurring germline mutation (c.1162G>A/rs351855 G/A) in the FGFR4 (CD334) gene enhances signal transducer and activator oftranscription 3 (STAT3) signaling and is associated with poor prognosis andaccelerated progression of multiple cancer types. Here, using rs351855SNP-knockin transgenic mice and Fgfr4-knockout mice, we reveal thegenotype-specific gain of immunological function of suppressing theCD8/CD4+FOXP3+CD25+ regulatory T cell ratio in vivo. Furthermore, using knockintransgenic mouse models for lung and breast cancers, we establish thehost-specific, tumor-extrinsic functions of STAT3-enhancing germline variants in impeding the tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells. Thus, STAT3-enhancing germlinereceptor variants contribute to immune evasion through their pleiotropicfunctions in immune cells.DOI: 10.1172/JCI96708 PMCID: PMC5919827PMID: 29438108
