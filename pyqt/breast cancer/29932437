We investigated whether the expression of RANK was related with clinicopathological features of primary endometrial tumors.Immunohistochemistry was used in an endometrial cancer tissue array containingsamples from 36 tumors. The amount of RANK mRNA was examined in a tissue scancDNA array containing cDNA from 40 tumors. Normal endometrium was examined forcomparison. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that RANK expression was higherin malignant than in normal endometrium (p < 0.05). RANK expression was relatedto histological grade (Pearson correlation index = 0.484, p < 0.001), but not to tumor stage or to age of the women. The gene expression was similar in malignant and normal endometrium. The study of RANK isoforms confirmed that the overallrelative abundance of the three clearly identified transcripts was similar innormal and pathological endometrium. RANK protein expression increased fromnormal to malignant endometrium, and the expression level was related with tumor grade but not with stage or the age of subjects in endometrial cancer. Incontrast, similar comparisons showed no change in RANK gene expression.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19071848 PMID: 29932437
