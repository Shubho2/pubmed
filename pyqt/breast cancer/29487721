Due to its rarity, the clinicopathologicalcharacteristics and survival outcomes of the lung ASC are incompletelyunderstood. We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)database to enroll 203,208 eligible patients, including 4,245 ASC, 124,253adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 74,710 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients. To date, this is the largest cohort in a study for ASC of the lung. With regard to age,sex, race, year of diagnosis, tumor size and SEER stage, ASC was intermediatebetween ADC and SCC. However, compared with ADC and SCC patients, ASC patientspresented with a higher tumor grade and lower prevalence of nodal metastasis.More ASC patients underwent surgery and a lower proportion underwent radiationtreatment and chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that ASC patients had a better prognosis than ADC and SCC patients, but stratified analysis showed thatthe prognosis of ASC patients was worse than that of ADC and SCC patients insurgery and non-surgery subgroup. Multivariate analysis further confirmed thatthe ASC histology type was a risk factor for poor prognosis with respect to ADCand SCC. Using the propensity score matching to 1:1 match ASC with ADC or SCC, wefound that ASC patients had worse survival than ADC and SCC patients. Subgroupanalysis further demonstrated that ASC was a more aggressive histology type with a worse prognosis. These results provided a deep understanding of ASC, whichcontributed to better clinical diagnosis and treatment.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23550 PMCID: PMC5814288PMID: 29487721
