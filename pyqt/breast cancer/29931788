Caenorhabditis elegans unc-119 encodes a proteinthat is required for normal development of the nervous system. Humans have 2unc-119 homologues, UNC119 and UNC119B. We have identified UNC119 as aRASSF6-interacting protein. UNC119 promotes the interaction between RASSF6 andMDM2 and stabilizes p53. Thus, UNC119 induces apoptosis by RASSF6 and p53. UNC119depletion impairs DNA repair after DNA damage and results in polyploid cellgeneration. These findings support that UNC119 is a regulator of theRASSF6-MDM2-p53 axis and functions as a tumor suppressor.Â© 2018 The Authors.
