Here, we assessed the feasibility of hypnotic induction session as adjunct therapy in conscious sedation for venousaccess device implantation. Primary outcomes were safety and patientsatisfaction.METHODS: Thirty consecutive women with breast cancer were proposed adjunct ofhypnosis before implantation under conscious sedation (midazolam: 0.5 mg ± bolus of Ketamin: 5 mg on demand) indicated for chemotherapy. Self-hypnosis wasprogrammed and guided by one of two trained anesthesiologists. Implantation wasperformed by one of two experimented surgeons. It consisted of blind subclavianimplantation of Braun ST 305 devices using a percutaneous technique adapted from Selinger's procedure. Clinical data were prospectively collected andretrospectively analyzed. A comprehensive custom-made questionnaire recordedpatient satisfaction.RESULTS: In all, 30/30 patients consented to the procedure. The median age was54 years (range: 35-77 years). The primary procedure was successful in 29/30. Onecase was converted into internal jugular vein access after a first attempt.Median length time of the implantation procedure in the operative room was 20 min(range: 10-60 min). Median length time in the recovery room preceding homedischarge was 65 min (range: 15-185 min). None of the patients sufferedcomplications. The satisfaction rate was ≥90%, 27/30 patients would get hypnosis in case of reimplantation if necessary and 27/30 would recommend this procedureto others.CONCLUSION: Hypnosis under conscious sedation appears feasible and safe for port implantation under conscious sedation in cancer patients. Further studies woulddetermine the exact value of hypnosis effectiveness.DOI: 10.1177/1129729818757975 PMID: 29566587
