According to these studies, PET/CTis not routinely performed for the diagnosis of primary breast cancer, althoughPET/CT in specific subtypes of breast cancer correlates with histopathologicfeatures of the primary tumor. PET/CT can detect metastases to mediastinal,axial, and internal mammary nodes, but it cannot replace the sentinel nodebiopsy. In detection of distant metastases, this imaging tool may have a betteraccuracy in detecting lytic bone metastases compared to bone scintigraphy. Thus, PET/CT is recommended when advanced-stage disease is suspected, and conventional modalities are inconclusive. Also, PET/CT has a high sensitivity and specificity to detect loco-regional recurrence and is recommended in asymptomatic patientswith rising tumor markers. Numerous studies support the future role of PET/CT in prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). PET/CT has a higherdiagnostic value for prognostic risk stratification in comparison withconventional modalities. With the continuing research on the treatment planningand evaluation of patients with breast cancer, the role of PET/CT can be further extended.DOI: 10.1007/s11307-018-1181-3 PMID: 29516387
