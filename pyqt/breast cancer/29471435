Here,we aimed at evaluating the prevalence, levels, and composition oftumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and their association withclinico-pathological and outcome variables in ILC, and to compare them with IDC.Methods: We considered two patient series with TIL data: a multicentricretrospective series (n = 614) and the BIG 02-98 study (n = 149 ILC and 807 IDC).We compared immune subsets identified by immuno-histochemistry in the ILC(n = 159) and IDC (n = 468) patients from the Nottingham series, as well as theCIBERSORT immune profiling of the ILC (n = 98) and IDC (n = 388) METABRIC and TheCancer Genome Atlas patients. All ILC/IDC comparisons were done in estrogenreceptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negativetumors. All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: TIL levels were statistically significantly lower in ILC compared withIDC (fold-change = 0.79, 95% confidence interval = 0.70 to 0.88, P < .001). InILC, high TIL levels were associated with young age, lymph node involvement, and high proliferative tumors. In the univariate analysis, high TIL levels wereassociated with worse prognosis in the retrospective and BIG 02-98 lobularseries, although they did not reach statistical significance in the latter. TheNottingham series revealed that the levels of intratumoral but not total CD8+were statistically significantly lower in ILC compared with IDC. Comparison ofthe CIBERSORT profiles highlighted statistically significant differences in termsof immune composition.Conclusions: This study shows differences between the immune infiltrates ofER-positive/HER2-negative ILC and IDC in terms of prevalence, levels,localization, composition, and clinical associations.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djx268 PMCID: PMC6037125PMID: 29471435
