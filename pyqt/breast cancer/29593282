Vitamin C serves as a cofactor for TETmethylcytosine dioxygenases to increase 5hmC generation. Here we show that thetranscription of SVCT2, a major vitamin C transporter, was decreased in humanbreast cancers (113 cases) compared to normal breast tissues from the samepatients. A decreased SVCT2 expression was also observed in breast cancer celllines. Treatment with vitamin C (100 Î¼M) increased the 5hmC content in MDA-MB-231breast cancer cells and markedly altered the transcriptome. The vitamin Ctreatment induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which was verified in twoadditional breast cancer cell lines. This pro-apoptotic effect of vitamin Cappeared to be mediated by TRAIL, a known apoptosis inducer. Vitamin Cupregulated TRAIL transcripts (2.3-fold increase) and increased TRAIL proteinlevels. The upregulation of TRAIL by vitamin C was largely abolished by siRNAstargeting TETs and anti-TRAIL antibody abrogated the induction of apoptosis.Furthermore, the apoptosis promoted by vitamin C was associated with Bax andcaspases activation, Bcl-xL sequestration, and cytochrome c release. Takentogether, these results suggest a potential role of physiological doses ofvitamin C in breast cancer prevention and treatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-23714-7 PMCID: PMC5871772PMID: 29593282
