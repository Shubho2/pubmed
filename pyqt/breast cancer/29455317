A series of mature and monodermal ovarian teratomas were analyzed by short tandem repeat genotyping to evaluate their genetic zygosity and itsassociations. Informative DNA genotyping data were obtained for ten matureteratomas, six struma ovarii, and three carcinoids (one insular, one trabecular, and one mucinous). A homozygous genotype was present in five of the ten (50%)mature teratomas, three of the six (50%) struma ovarii, and one of the three(33%) ovarian carcinoids. There was no significant difference in genetic zygositybetween mature and monodermal teratomas. Patients' age was not correlated withthe genetic zygosity: the youngest age in the homozygous tumor group of patients was 4Â years. It is suggested that an oocyte after meiosis I, which has escapedfrom meiotic arrest, is a significant cause of these tumors. Although one mature teratoma was a rare case with lactating adenoma-like breast tissue, its geneticzygosity was concordant with that of the surrounding teratomatous tissue. In one ovarian carcinoid, the carcinoid and accompanying teratomatous components showed matching zygosity at all but one locus: the carcinoid was heterozygous butteratoma was homozygous at one pericentromeric locus. This suggests that not all carcinoids are secondary neoplasms arising from a fully developed matureteratoma: some are neoplasms deviating from a developing mature teratoma.DOI: 10.1007/s00428-018-2319-z PMID: 29455317  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
