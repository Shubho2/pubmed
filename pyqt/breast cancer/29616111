China.Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which arises from the nasopharynx epithelium, is most common in Southeast Asia, particularly in Southern China. To date, a varietyof microRNAs have been demonstrated to serve key functions in the progression anddevelopment of NPC. microRNA-425 (miR-425) has previously been reported to befrequently abnormally expressed in a number of different types of human cancer,including lung, gastric, cervical, breast and prostate cancer. However, to thebest of our knowledge, the expression patterns, functions and underlyingmechanisms of miR-425 in NPC remain largely unexplored. In the present study, theexpression of miR-425 was revealed to be low in NPC tissues and cell line.Resumption of miR-425 expression suppressed cell viability and invasion in NPC.Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) was identified as a direct target gene ofmiR-425 in NPC. HDGF was highly expressed at mRNA and protein levels in NPCtissues. Additionally, HDGF mRNA was negatively correlated with miR-425expression in NPC tissues. Furthermore, overexpression of HDGF almost completely rescued the tumor-suppressing effects of miR-425 on NPC cell viability andinvasion. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-425 acted as atumor suppressor in NPC by targeting HDGF, suggesting that it may be a noveltherapeutic target for the treatments of patients with NPC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8128 PMCID: PMC5876440PMID: 29616111
