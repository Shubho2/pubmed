The propensity to develop breast cancer brainmetastases (BCBMs) varies by subtype, occurring in up to one half of those withtriple negative breast cancer (TNBC), approximately a third of HER+ breastcancers and 14% in hormone positive disease. Median survival after BCBM diagnosiscan be as short as 5 months in TNBC and 10-18 months in the other subtypes. Here,we review the biology of BCBMs and how it informs the rational design of newtherapeutic approaches and agents. We discuss application of novel targeted andimmunotherapies by breast cancer subtype. It is noteworthy that there are no U.S.Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments specifically for BCBMscurrently. Nevertheless, there are legitimate grounds for hope as patients withBCBMs are now being included in clinical trials of systemic therapies and abetter understanding of the biology and genetic underpinning of BCBMs is driving an increased range of options for patients.DOI: 10.21037/atm.2018.04.35 PMCID: PMC5985267PMID: 29911111
