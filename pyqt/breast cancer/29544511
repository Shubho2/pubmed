Guidelinessupport the use of proton radiotherapy in specific disease sites or on clinicaltrials. This study aims to evaluate direct-to-consumer advertising content andclaims made by proton therapy centre (PTC) websites worldwide.METHODS: Operational PTC websites in English were identified through the ParticleTherapy Co-Operative Group website. Data abstraction of website content wasperformed independently by two investigators. Eight international guidelines wereconsulted to determine guideline-based indications for proton radiotherapy.Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine thecharacteristics of PTC websites that indicated proton radiotherapy offeredgreater disease control or cure rates.RESULTS: Forty-eight PTCs with 46 English websites were identified. 60·9% of PTC websites claimed proton therapy provided improved disease control or cure. U.S.websites listed more indications than international websites (15·5 ± 5·4 vs.10·4 ± 5·8, p = 0·004). The most common disease sites advertised were prostate(87·0%), head and neck (87·0%) and pediatrics (82·6%), all of which wereindicated in least one international guideline. Several disease sites advertised were not present in any consensus guidelines, including pancreatobiliary (52·2%),breast (50·0%), and esophageal (43·5%) cancers. Multivariate analysis foundincreasing number of disease sites and claiming their centre was a local orregional leader in proton radiotherapy was associated with indicating protonradiotherapy offers greater disease control or cure.CONCLUSIONS: Information from PTC websites often differs from recommendationsfound in international consensus guidelines. As online marketing information may have significant influence on patient decision-making, alignment of suchinformation with accepted guidelines and consensus opinion should be adopted byPTC providers.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-0988-z PMCID: PMC5856220PMID: 29544511
