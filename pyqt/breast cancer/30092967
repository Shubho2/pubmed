Little is known regarding the rate of chemotherapy-relatedcardiotoxicity and adherence to recommendations for cardiac monitoring amongchemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients.METHODS: Patients >18 years of age with a diagnosis of nonmetastatic invasivebreast cancer between 2009 and 2014, treated with chemotherapy within 6 months oftheir diagnosis, were identified in the Truven Health MarketScan (IBM WatsonHealth, Cambridge, Massachusetts) database. HF, comorbidities, and treatmentdetails were identified using diagnosis and billing codes. Analyses includeddescriptive statistics, Cox proportional hazard regression, andlogistic regression.RESULTS: A total of 16,456 patients were included; the median age was 56 yearsold. Cardiotoxicity was identified in 4.2% of patients. Therapy with trastuzumab (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72 to 2.36) andanthracyclines (HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.30 to 1.80), Deyo comorbidity scores (HR:1.38; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.66; HR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.94 to 3.15 for scores of 1and ≥2, respectively), hypertension (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.51), and valvedisease (HR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.48 to 2.51) were associated with an increased riskof cardiotoxicity. Patients ≤35 years of age (HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.72) and36 to 49 years of age (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.62) were less likelyto have cardiotoxicity than patients 65 years of age and older. Among 4,325patients treated with trastuzumab, guideline-adherent cardiac monitoring wasidentified in 46.2% of patients. Therapies using anthracyclines (odds ratio [OR]:1.58; 95% CI: 1.35 to 1.87), taxanes (OR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.27 to 2.08), andradiation (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.39) were associated withguideline-adherent monitoring.CONCLUSIONS: HF is an uncommon complication of breast cancer therapies. The risk was higher among patients treated with trastuzumab or anthracyclines and lower inyounger patients. Cardiac monitoring among trastuzumab-treated patients should bea priority among high-risk patients and in the presence of comorbiditiesor other chemotherapies such as those using anthracyclines.Copyright © 2018 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
