The new compound 1 and the knowncompound 3 exhibited moderate cytotoxic activities against three human cancercell lines (A549, lung cancer; MCF7, breast cancer; HeLa, cervical cancer) and a human normal cell line (WI-38 fibroblast), with IC50 values ranging from 29.0 to 68.0 Î¼M.DOI: 10.1080/14786419.2018.1465057 PMID: 29683344
