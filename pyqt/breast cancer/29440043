Emerging evidence supports the use of acupunctureas an effective pain management strategy for this condition, but itsacceptability among cancer survivors is unknown. We evaluated breast cancersurvivors' preferences for acupuncture as compared with medication use andidentified factors predictive of this preference.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among breast cancer survivors whowere currently, or had been, taking an AI. The primary outcome was degree ofpreference for acupuncture as compared with medication for pain management. Weconducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to evaluate the effects ofsocioeconomic status (SES) factors and health beliefs on treatment preference.RESULTS: Among 592 participants, 160 (27.0%) preferred acupuncture, 153 (25.8%)preferred medication and 279 (47.1%) had no clear preference. In a multivariateanalysis that only included SES, higher education and white race weresignificantly associated with greater preference for acupuncture. When healthbeliefs were added, SES effects were attenuated, while greater expectation ofacupuncture's effect, lower perceived barriers to its use, higher social norm(endorsement from family members and healthcare professionals) related toacupuncture and higher holistic health beliefs were associated with greaterpreference for acupuncture.CONCLUSION: We found similar rates of preference for acupuncture versusmedication among breast cancer survivors for pain management. Specific attitudes and beliefs predicted such preferences, highlighting the importance of apatient-centred approach to align patient beliefs and preferences withtherapeutic options for more effective pain management.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01013337; Results.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
