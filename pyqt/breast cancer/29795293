Several distinctepithelial subpopulations have been proposed, but complete understanding of thespectrum of heterogeneity and differentiation hierarchy in the human breastremains elusive. Here, we use single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to profilethe transcriptomes of 25,790 primary human breast epithelial cells isolated from reduction mammoplasties of seven individuals. Unbiased clustering analysisreveals the existence of three distinct epithelial cell populations, one basaland two luminal cell types, which we identify as secretory L1- andhormone-responsive L2-type cells. Pseudotemporal reconstruction ofdifferentiation trajectories produces one continuous lineage hierarchy thatclosely connects the basal lineage to the two differentiated luminal branches.Our comprehensive cell atlas provides insights intoÂ the cellular blueprint of thehuman breast epithelium and will form the foundation to understand how the systemgoes awry during breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04334-1 PMCID: PMC5966421PMID: 29795293
