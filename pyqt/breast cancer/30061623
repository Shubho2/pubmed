Here, we show thatestrogen suppresses invasion of ER+ breast cancer cells by increasingtranscription of the Ena/VASP protein, EVL, which promotes the generation ofsuppressive cortical actin bundles that inhibit motility dynamics, and is crucialfor the ER-mediated suppression of invasion in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, despite its benefits in suppressing tumor growth, anti-estrogenic endocrinetherapy decreases EVL expression and increases local invasion in patients. Ourresults highlight the dichotomous effects of estrogen on tumor progression andsuggest that, in contrast to its established role in promoting growth of ER+tumors, estrogen has a significant role in suppressing invasion through actincytoskeletal remodeling.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05367-2 PMCID: PMC6065369PMID: 30061623
