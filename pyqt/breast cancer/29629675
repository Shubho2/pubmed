South Africa (SA) currently has no dataregarding the aetiology of MPE.OBJECTIVES: To identify the most common malignancies causing MPE in a population served by a large tertiary hospital in SA, and specifically the relativecontribution of mesothelioma. A secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of chemical pleurodesis in a subset of patients.METHODS: We retrospectively included all known cases of MPE evaluated at ourinstitution over a 3-year period with a tissue diagnosis of MPE.RESULTS: The most common causes of MPE in a total of 274 patients were lungcancer (n=174, 63.5%), breast cancer (n=32, 11.7%), unknown primary (n=22, 11.7%)and mesothelioma (n=27, 9.9%). Talc pleurodesis was performed in 81 of 194patients (41.8%) referred to our division, and was radiologically successful in22 of 25 (88.0%) followed up to 3 months.CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of MPE in our setting was lung cancer, followed bybreast cancer, unknown primary and mesothelioma. Chemical pleurodesis was aviable palliative measure for MPE in this population.PMID: 29629675  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
