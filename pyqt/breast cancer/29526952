[Epub ahead ofprint]Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome Associated with Synchronous Double Cancer: ACombination of Small Cell Carcinoma of the Cervix and Breast Carcinoma.Fukuda H(1), Tanaka A(2)(3), Hirashima Y(2), Ito I(4).Author information: (1)Division of Neurology, Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital, Japan.(2)Division of Gynecology, Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital, Japan.(3)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chutoen General Medical Center,Japan.(4)Division of Pathology, Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital, Japan.Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is most commonly associated with smallcell lung carcinoma, while it is rarely associated with gynecological and breast carcinoma. We herein report a case of LEMS associated with synchronous doublecancer, which was a combination of small cell carcinoma of the cervix and breast carcinoma. The early diagnosis and treatment of LEMS are important for achieving a good outcome. The possibility of accompanying paraneoplastic neurologicalsyndrome must be sufficiently considered in gynecology and breast cancerpatients. To our knowledge, this is the first report of LEMS associated withsynchronous double cancer.DOI: 10.2169/internalmedicine.0428-17 PMID: 29526952
