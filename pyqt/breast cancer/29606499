Electronic address: m.knothetate@unsw.edu.au.For a century-old problem, edema and its treatment have gone remarkably unnoticedby the biomedical community. Given the prevalence of lymphedema and itsdebilitating repercussions, there is an acute need for both efficacy-basedmeasures and clinical standards to guide compression garment design andtherapeutic application. This review outlines the current state of the art incompression treatment and suggests an integrated biomedical engineering approach going forward. Characterizing the pressure gradient profiles of commercialcompression sleeves is necessary to better understand the role of compressiontreatment in the mitigation of swelling. Integration of pressure sensortechnologies with advanced materials design and manufacture provides a criticalpath not only to elucidate the mechanisms of but also to improve on currentcompression-based therapies and associated therapeutic devices.Copyright Â© 2018.
