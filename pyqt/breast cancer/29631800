Furthermore, we wanted to determine whether this lessinvasive method could potentially be a pre-operative surgical strategy. Onehundred sixty-four sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were detected by CEUS afterintradermal injection of microbubbles in 126 cases. One hundred twenty of 126cases (95.24%) were accurately diagnosed with the SLN-FNA method. All 6false-negative cases were due to micrometastasis or macrometastasis. There wereno false-positive results after CEUS-guided FNA biopsy based on post-operativehistopathological results. In conclusion, translymphatic CEUS combined withSLN-FNA is a less traumatic approach that has high accuracy in the pre-operative evaluation of axillary lymph node status. It might have the potential to be asreliable an indicator for axillary lymph node dissection as SLN biopsy.Copyright Â© 2018 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology.Published by Elsevier Inc.
