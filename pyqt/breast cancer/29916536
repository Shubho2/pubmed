China.Recently, microRNA (miR)‑590‑5p has been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis incolorectal and breast cancer; however, its function in osteosarcoma (OS) requiresfurther investigation. In the present study miR‑590‑5p expression was poorlyexpressed in OS samples and cell lines when compared with that observed in normalcells. In addition, overexpression of miR‑590‑5p significantly reduced theproliferation, migration and invasion of SAOS2 and U2OS cells in vitro, as wellas inhibiting tumor sizes in vivo. The results revealed that miR‑590‑5p directly targeted Kruppel‑like factor 5 (KLF5) in SAOS2 and U2OS cells. Their expressionwas inversely correlated with OS tissues. Finally, it was demonstrated thatoverexpression of KLF5 rescued the inhibitory effects of miR‑590‑5p on cellproliferation, migration and invasion. Overall, the results of the present study suggested that the miR‑590‑5p/KLF5 axis may regulate OS progression and thus, maybe a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with OS.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9173 PMID: 29916536
