This study aims to provide baseline data for mammographic density profiling of women living in RasAl Khaimah (RAK) and to identify risk factors associated with high mammographicdensity. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to examine a series of 366mammography cases. The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS, 5thedition) was used to evaluate mammographic density. Pearson’s chi-squared,Mann-Whitney U test and multivariate logistic regression were used forstatistical analysis. Results: Most participants (67%) fell into BI-RADS b and c mammographic density categories. Of the total sample, women who were aged ≤ 45years (p=0.004, OR=1.9), weighed ≤ 71kg (p=<0.0001, OR=4.8), had a body massindex of ≤ 27 kg/m2 (p=<0.0001, OR=5.1) and were of non-Arab descent (p=0.007,OR=1.8) were significantly more likely to have denser breast tissue. Adjustedethnicity regression analysis showed that Emirati women were significantly lesslikely to have dense breast tissue compared with Western women (p=0.04, OR=0.4). Among the sample of survey participants, increased odds of having mammographicdensity were among women who were full-time workers (p=0.02, OR=2.8), ofChristian faith (p=0.007, OR=4.4), nulliparous (p=0.003, OR=10.8), had three orfewer children (p=0.03, OR=3.8), and had used oral contraceptives for three yearsor more (p=0.01, OR=6.1). Conclusion: This study indicated that because Emiratiwomen have a low mammographic density profile, screening mammography can beconsidered as an effective early detection imaging modality.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.6.1607 PMID: 29936786
