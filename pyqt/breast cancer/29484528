Weengineer a cell line to over-express the multi-drug resistance 1 protein (MDR1), an ATP-dependent pump that effluxes intracellular drug. Co-culture experimentsmixing the MDR1-overexpressing line with its parental line are evaluated viafluorescence microscopy. To quantify the impact of population heterogeneity ontherapy response, these data are analyzed with a coupledpharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics model. The proliferation and death rates ofeach line vary with co-culture condition (the relative fraction of each cell lineat the time of seeding). For example, the death rate in the parental line underlow-dose doxorubicin treatment is increased from 0.64 (± 0.22) × 10-2 to1.46 (± 0.58) × 10-2 h-1 with increasing fractions of MDR1-overexpressing cells. The growth rate of the MDR1-overexpressing line increases 29% as its relativefraction is decreased. Simulations of the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics modelsuggest increased efflux from MDR1-overexpressing cells contributes to theincreased death rate in the parental cells. Experimentally, the death rate ofparental cells is constant across co-culture conditions under co-treatment withan MDR1 inhibitor. These data indicate that intercellular pharmacokineticvariability should be considered in analyzing treatment response in heterogeneouspopulations.DOI: 10.1007/s10439-018-2001-2 PMCID: PMC5935587 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29484528
