Wepreviously observed that visceral metastasis of highly aggressive andinflammatory 4THM breast carcinoma cells was markedly decreased in CD200transgenic mice. The goal of this study was to determine whether exogenousexposure to CD200fc mimics the effects of endogenously over expressed CD200.Female BALB/c mice were injected with CD200fc two times a week for five times.Injection was started two days after orthotopic injection of 4THM cells. Tumorinfiltrating Gr1+Cd11b+ cells were decreased while CD8+ cells were increased inCD200fc-treated animals. CD200fc injection significantly decreased lung and livermetastasis and the growth of primary tumors. CD200fc injection enhanced thetumor-induced IFN-g response while suppressing the IL-10 response. We observedexcessive basal IL-6 secretion in MLC which was significantly decreased inCD200fc treated mice 12 days after injection of 4TM cells. These results are inaccord with previous data from CD200 transgenic mice, and demonstrate for thefirst time that CD200 analogues might have therapeutic potential in the treatmentof aggressive breast carcinoma which induces excessive systemic inflammation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24931 PMCID: PMC5922384PMID: 29721190
