A recent study of 560 breastcancers identified 82 genes with 916 point mutations as drivers in the genesis ofthis malignancy. Because estrogens play a major role in breast cancer developmentand are also known to regulate the expression of numerous genes, we hypothesizethat the 82 driver genes are likely to be influenced by estrogens, such as17ß-estradiol (E2), and the estrogen receptor ESR1 (ERα). Because different typesof tumors are characterized by unique sets of cancer driver genes, we also argue that the fraction of driver genes regulated by E2-ESR1 is lower in malignanciesnot associated with estrogens, e.g., acute myeloid leukemia (AML).Methods: Weperformed a literature search of each driver gene to determine its E2-ESR1regulation.Results: Fifty-three of the 82 driver genes (64.6%) identified inbreast cancers showed evidence of E2-ESR1 regulation. In contrast, only 19 of 54 mutated driver genes (35.2%) identified in AML were linked to E2-ESR1. Among the 916 driver mutations found in breast cancers, 813 (88.8%) were linked to E2-ESR1 compared with 2,046 of 3,833 in AML (53.4%).Conclusions: Risk assessment revealedthat mutations in estrogen-regulated genes are much more likely to be associated with elevated breast cancer risk, while mutations in unregulated genes are morelikely to be associated with AML.Impact: These results increase the plausibility that estrogens promote breast cancer development.
