[Epub ahead of print]The Clinical Significance of Breast-only and Node-only Pathologic CompleteResponse (pCR) After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT): A Review of 20,000 BreastCancer Patients in the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB).Fayanju OM(1)(2), Ren Y(3), Thomas SM(2)(3), Greenup RA(1)(2), Plichta JK(1)(2), Rosenberger LH(1)(2), Tamirisa N(1), Force J(2)(4), Boughey JC(5), HyslopT(2)(3), Hwang ES(1)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.(2)Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC.(3)Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University School ofMedicine, Durham, NC.(4)Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.(5)Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the association between overall survival (OS) andresponse to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in breast cancer patients varies withtumor subtype and anatomic extent of pathologic complete response (pCR).BACKGROUND: pCR after NACT predicts improved OS in breast cancer, but it isunclear whether pCR limited to the breast or axilla is also associated with OS.METHODS: Women with cT1-3/cN0-1 breast cancer diagnosed in 2010 to 2014 whounderwent surgery following NACT were identified in the NCDB and divided into 4subtypes based on reported hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazardsmodels were used to estimate OS. Multivariate logistic regression was used toidentify factors associated with post-NACT response, defined as upstage (ypstage>clinical stage); no change (clinical stage = yp stage); overall(breast+axilla, ypT0N0), breast-only (ypT0N1/N1mic), or node-only (ypT1-3N0) pCR.RESULTS: Of 33,162 identified patients, 20,265 experienced overall pCR (n = 6370,19.2%), breast-only pCR (n = 494, 1.5%), node-only pCR (n = 1133, 3.4%), no stagechange (n = 9641, 29.1%), or upstage (n = 2627, 7.9%). Compared with no stagechange, breast-only pCR was associated with improved OS in triple-negativedisease [hazard ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.37-0.89], and node-only pCR was associated with improved OS in both triple-negative (hazardratio = 0.55,95% CI = 0.39-0.76) and HR+/HER2- disease (hazard ratio = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.33-0.89). For patients achieving overall (breast+axilla) pCR, unadjusted5-year OS was 0.94 (95% CI = 0.93-0.95), with no difference between patients who were cN0 (hazard ratio = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.93-0.96) or cN1 (hazard ratio = 0.94,95% CI = 0.92-0.96) at diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: In node-positive patients, pCR limited to either the breast oraxilla predicts survival for select receptor subtypes. In patients achieving pCR in both the breast and axilla, survival is driven by response to NACT rather thanpresenting cN stage.DOI: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000002953 PMID: 30048319
