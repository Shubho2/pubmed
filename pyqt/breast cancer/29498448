Epub 2018 Mar 2.Variations in cancer care for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with ductalcarcinoma in situ.Voci A(1), Bandera B(1), Ho E(1), Lee J(1), Goldfarb M(1), DiNome M(1)(2).Author information: (1)John Wayne Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John's Health Center, SantaMonica, CA, USA.(2)David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.NCCN guidelines recommend tamoxifen (TAM) for adjuvant treatment of ductalcarcinoma in situ (DCIS). TAM has side effects that can potentially complicatetreatment recommendations and patient acceptance. It is unknown how well-acceptedthis recommended therapy is for the adolescent and young adult (AYA) patientpopulation with DCIS. The NCDB was used to identify patients aged 15-39 with DCIStreated between 2000 and 2012. Patient demographic, socioeconomic, and treatment data were collected. Chi-squared test and multivariate analysis were used forstatistical assessment. A total of 3988 women were identified of which 1795 (45%)were recommended for endocrine therapy. Age > 30 (OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.01-1.70),Black (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.12-1.65), or Asian (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.08-1.94) race,treatment at a nonacademic facility (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56-0.91), geographiclocation of treating facility, receipt of radiation (OR 5.30, 95% CI 4.59-6.11), and negative margins (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.47-3.11) were significant predictors ofrecommendation for endocrine therapy. Of those recommended, 1484 (83%) acceptedtreatment. Age, race, and annual income were significant variables affectingacceptance. Overall, only 37.2% (1484 of 3988) of women in this study initiatedendocrine therapy for treatment of DCIS. Our results demonstrate that little overa third of patients in the AYA cohort receive endocrine therapy as treatment for DCIS. The bias appears to lie in physician recommendation because whenrecommended, the majority of patients accept treatment. Factors exist bothmedical and nonmedical that appear to influence these treatment decisions.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.12999 PMID: 29498448
