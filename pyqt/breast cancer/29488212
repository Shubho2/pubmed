Fairbanks School of Public Health,Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN.(3)Department of Biostatistics, Indiana University School of Medicine,Indianapolis, IN.Although metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a prognostic factor for cancer occurrence, the association of MetS and cancer mortality remains unclear. The purpose of thisstudy was to evaluate whether MetS, components of MetS and C-reactive protein(CRP) are associated with cancer mortality in women. A total of 400 cancerdeaths, with 140 deaths from obesity-linked-cancers (OLCas), [breast (BCa),colorectal, pancreatic and endometrial], linked through the National Death Index,were identified from 10,104 eligible subjects aged ≥18 years. Cox proportionalhazards regression was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR)for cancer mortality. MetS was associated with increased deaths for total cancer [HR = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.70] and BCa [HR = 2.1, 95% CI,1.09-4.11]. The risk of total cancer [HR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.12-2.68], OLCas[HR = 2.1, 95% CI, 1.00-4.37] and BCa [HR = 3.8, 95% CI, 1.34-10.91] mortalitywas highest for women with all MetS components abnormal, compared to thosewithout MetS. Linear associations of blood-pressure [HR = 2.5, 1.02-6.12,Quartile (Q) 4 vs Q1, p trend = 0.004] and blood-glucose [HR = 2.2, 1.04-4.60, Q4vs. Q1, p trend = 0.04] with total-OLCas mortality were observed. A threefoldincreased risk of BCa mortality was observed for women with enlarged waistcircumference, ≥100.9 cm, [HR = 3.5, 1.14-10.51, p trend = 0.008] and in thosewith increased blood glucose, ≥101 mg/dL, [HR = 3.2, 1.11-9.20, p trend = 0.03]compared to those in Q1. None of the components of MetS were associated withtotal-cancer mortality. CRP was not associated with cancer mortality. Inconclusion, MetS is associated with total-cancer and breast-cancer mortality,with waist circumference, blood pressure and blood glucose as independentpredictors of OLCas and BCa mortality.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31344 PMCID: PMC6019165 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29488212
