The current study aimed toestimate the association of APEX1 and OGG1 polymorphisms with the risk of breast cancer development.METHODS: A total of 518 patients with histopathologically confirmed breast cancerand 921 region- and age-matched cancer-free controls were genotyped for the APEX1polymorphisms rs3136817 and rs1130409 and the OGG1 polymorphisms rs1052133 andrs2072668 using a QuantStudio™ 12 K Flex Real-Time PCR System.RESULTS: The rs3136817 heterozygous TC genotype along with the rs3136817 dominantmodel (TC + CC) was strongly associated with breast cancer susceptibility (oddsratio [OR] = 0.670, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.513 - 0.873, P = 0.003;OR = 0.682, 95% CI: 0.526 - 0.883, P = 0.004, respectively). No significantassociations were observed among rs1130409, rs1052133, rs2072668 and breastcancer risk. Furthermore, an allele combination analysis revealed that APEX1haplotypes containing C-T (alleles rs3136817 and rs1130409) conferred asignificantly lower risk (corrected P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: This research is the latest report showing that an APEX1 rs3136817heterozygous genotype may have a positive influence on DNA repair capacity inpatients with breast cancer and thus may have a potential protective effect forChinese Han women.DOI: 10.1186/s12881-018-0578-9 PMCID: PMC5930440PMID: 29720094
