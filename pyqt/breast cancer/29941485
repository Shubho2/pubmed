We previouslyidentified E-cadherin (CDH1) as a repressor of IGF1 signaling and in this studyexamined how loss of E-cadherin affects IGF1R signaling and response toanti-IGF1R/insulin receptor (InsR) therapies in breast cancer.ExperimentalDesign: Breast cancer cell lines were used to assess how altered E-cadherinlevels regulate IGF1R signaling and response to two anti-IGF1R/InsR therapies. Insitu proximity ligation assay (PLA) was used to define interaction between IGF1R and E-cadherin. TCGA RNA-seq and RPPA data were used to compare IGF1R/InsRactivation in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tumors. ER+ ILC cell lines and xenografttumor explant cultures were used to evaluate efficacy to IGF1R pathway inhibitionin combination with endocrine therapy.Results: Diminished functional E-cadherinincreased both activation of IGF1R signaling and efficacy to anti-IGF1R/InsRtherapies. PLA demonstrated a direct endogenous interaction between IGF1R andE-cadherin at points of cell-cell contact. Increased expression of IGF1 ligandand levels of IGF1R/InsR phosphorylation were observed in E-cadherin-deficientER+ ILC compared with IDC tumors. IGF1R pathway inhibitors were effective ininhibiting growth in ER+ ILC cell lines and synergized with endocrine therapy andsimilarly IGF1R/InsR inhibition reduced proliferation in ILC tumor explantculture.Conclusions: We provide evidence that loss of E-cadherin hyperactivatesthe IGF1R pathway and increases sensitivity to IGF1R/InsR targeted therapy, thus identifying the IGF1R pathway as a potential novel target in E-cadherin-deficientbreast cancers.
