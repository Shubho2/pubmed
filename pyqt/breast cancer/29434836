China.Nuclear respiratory factor-1 (Nrf1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A(TFAM) are involved in the regulation of a variety of mitochondrial functionalgenes, which are associated with decreased sensitivity of tumor cells tochemotherapy. However, the expression status of Nrf1 and TFAM, as well as theirclinical significance in breast cancer, is unknown. In the present study, tumortissues and corresponding adjacent normal tissues were collected from 336patients with breast cancer, and Nrf1 and TFAM expression was analyzed byimmunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray. Expression of Nrf1 and TFAM wassignificantly increased in breast cancer tissue compared with adjacent normaltissues. In addition, patients positive for Nrf1 or TFAM had a poorer clinicalprognosis than patients who were negative, and those positive for Nrf1 and TFAMhad the shortest survival time. These results suggest that Nrf1 and TFAM arepotential biomarkers for the determination of individualized therapy and theprognosis of breast cancer, and molecular targeting of Nrf1 and TFAM is apromising strategy for the sensitization of breast cancer cells tochemotherapeutics.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7487 PMCID: PMC5774493PMID: 29434836
