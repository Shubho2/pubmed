Ovarian hormone disorder is thought to be associated with breasttumorigenesis. The present study investigated the effects of estrogen andprogesterone administration on cell proliferation and underlying mechanisms inbreast cancer MCF-7 cells. It was found that a single administration of estradiol(E2) or progesterone increased MCF-7 cell viability in a dose-dependent mannerand promoted cell cycle progression by increasing the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase. A combination of E2 and progesterone led to a stronger effect thansingle treatment. Moreover, cyclin G1 was up-regulated by E2 and/or progesterone in MCF-7 cells. After knockdown of cyclin G1 in MCF-7 cells using a specificshRNA, estradiol- and progesterone-mediated cell viability and clonogenic abilitywere significantly limited. Additionally, estradiol- and progesterone-promotedcell accumulation in the G2/M phase was reversed after knockdown of cyclin G1.These data indicated that estrogen and progesterone promoted breast cancer cellproliferation by inducing the expression of cyclin G1. Our data indicated thatnovel therapeutics against cyclin G1 are promising for the treatment of estrogen-and progesterone-mediated breast cancer progression.DOI: 10.1590/1414-431X20175612 PMCID: PMC5912097PMID: 29513878  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
