Olivia.Fletcher@icr.ac.uk.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 100 breastcancer risk loci. Translating these findings into a greater understanding of the mechanisms that influence disease risk requires identification of the genes ornon-coding RNAs that mediate these associations. Here, we use Capture Hi-C(CHi-C) to annotate 63 loci; we identify 110 putative target genes at 33 loci. Toassess the support for these target genes in other data sources we test forassociations between levels of expression and SNP genotype (eQTLs),disease-specific survival (DSS), and compare them with somatically mutated cancergenes. 22 putative target genes are eQTLs, 32 are associated with DSS and 14 are somatically mutated in breast, or other, cancers. Identifying the target genes atGWAS risk loci will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms thatinfluence breast cancer risk and prognosis.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03411-9 PMCID: PMC5847529PMID: 29531215  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
