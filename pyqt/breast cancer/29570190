Here, we describe an albumin-functionalized polymeric NC (Alb-NC) capable of crossing the endothelium barrier through a caveolae-mediated transcytosis pathway to better target cancer.The Alb-NC is prepared by nanoprecipitation of doxorubicin (Doxo) conjugates ofpoly(phenyl O-carboxyanhydrides) bearing aromatic albumin-binding domainsfollowed by subsequent surface decoration of albumin. The administration ofAlb-NCs into mice bearing MCF-7 human breast cancer xenografts with limited tumorvascular permeability resulted in markedly increased tumor accumulation andanti-tumor efficacy compared to their conventional counterpart PEGylated NCs(PEG-NCs). The Alb-NC provides a simple, low-cost and broadly applicable strategyto improve the cancer targeting efficiency and therapeutic effectiveness ofpolymeric nanomedicine.DOI: 10.1039/c8bm00149a PMID: 29570190
