In this study, we assessed thelong-term survival effect of the interval between surgery and PMRT in locallyadvanced breast cancer treated with mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy.Methods: In this retrospective study, we included women with locally advancedbreast cancer who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and PMRT after mastectomybetween 1999 and 2007. Based on the interval between surgery and PMRT, thepatients were classified into three groups: Group 1 (≤4 vs >4 months), Group 2(≤5 vs >5 months), and Group 3 (≤6 vs >6 months). Univariate and multivariateregression analyses were performed to determine the prognostic factors ofsurvival outcomes.Results: A total of 340 women were included in this study, and the medianfollow-up duration was 79.8 months. The median surgery-PMRT interval was 5months. The surgery-PMRT interval including Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3 was notsignificantly associated with locoregional recurrence-free survival, distantmetastasis-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival. Inaddition, in the subgroup analysis of the effect of surgery-PMRT interval onsurvival outcomes according to various clinicopathologic factors, thesurgery-PMRT interval was also not associated with survival outcomes in differentage groups, tumor stage, and breast cancer subtypes.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the delay in the start of PMRT in locallyadvanced breast cancer does not increase the likelihood of locoregionalrecurrence, distant metastasis, and death.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S163863 PMCID: PMC6053260PMID: 30038520
