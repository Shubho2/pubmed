We estimated primary tumor PET/CTparameters including the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and TLG, as well as clinicopathologic findings. All patientsreceived breast surgery followed by pathologic axillary lymph node examination.RESULTS: Of the 135 patients, 31 (23.0%) were diagnosed with pathologicallyproven metastatic ALN. In univariate analysis, SUVmax, MTV, and TLG of theprimary breast tumor were correlated with metastatic ALN along with tumor size,lymphovascular invasion, CD34, and D2-40. On multivariate analysis, TLG (> 5.74, p = 0.009) had independent significance for predicting ALN metastasis in IDC withcN-ALN.CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that TLG of primary tumors can be useful inpredicting pathologic ALN metastasis in IDC patients with cN-ALN.DOI: 10.1007/s12149-018-1288-2 PMID: 30094546
