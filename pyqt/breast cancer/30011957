Despite the incredible progress made in thisfield, metastatic breast cancer has a poor prognosis. In an era of personalizedmedicine, there is an urgent need for better knowledge of the biology leading to the disease, which can lead to the design of increasingly accurate drugs against patients' specific molecular aberrations. Among one of the actionable targets is the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway, triggered by specificligands. The Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors/Fibroblast Growth Factors(FGFRs/FGFs) axis offers interesting molecular targets to be pursued in clinical development. This mini-review will focus on the current knowledge of FGFRmutations, which lead to tumor formation and summarizes the state-of-the-arttherapeutic strategies for targeted treatments against the FGFRs/FGFs axis in thecontext of BC.DOI: 10.3390/cells7070076 PMCID: PMC6071019PMID: 30011957
