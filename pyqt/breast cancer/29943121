Associations between pretreatment hormones, clinical factors, and recovery of ovarian function(resumption of menstruation or anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) ≥ 1 ng/ml) wereevaluated at 12 months and long-term follow-up after completion of chemotherapy.RESULTS: Mean age was 32 years (range 23-42 years). In multivariate analyses,tamoxifen use (P = 0.035) and pretreatment follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)(P = 0.032) were predictive of resumption of menstruation, and age (P = 0.019),tamoxifen use (P = 0.022), pretreatment FSH (P < 0.001), and AMH (P = 0.040) werepredictors for AMH ≥ 1 ng/ml at 12 months. In addition, pretreatment AMH was apredictor for AMH ≥ 1 ng/ml after long-term follow-up. Receiver operatingcharacteristic curve analyses gave area under the curve of 0.805 for resumptionof menstruation and 0.903 for serum AMH concentration ≥ 1 ng/ml at 12 months,when age, tamoxifen use, pretreatment FSH, and AMH were combined.CONCLUSION: Pretreatment AMH (3.26 ng/ml), age (33.9 years), pretreatment FSH(5.5 IU/l), and tamoxifen use are useful predictors for AMH ≥ 1 ng/ml at12 months after GnRH agonist. This finding will support patient and cliniciandecision-making regarding fertility preservation.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4863-2 PMID: 29943121
