Electronic address:l-vanlemmens@o-lambret.fr.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy (BCP) is rare, but theprevalence is expected to rise. Long-term follow-up data regarding thisclinically challenging condition are scarce. The main objective of thismulticentre case-control French study was to compare the survival betweenpregnant patients and matched controls.METHODS: Patients from 27 centres diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 withhistologically proven invasive breast cancer occurring during pregnancy wereretrospectively included. Controls were matched to BCP patients on age, clinical T stage, hormone receptor, HER2, administration of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and pathological node involvement in the absence of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.Five-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: One hundred and eleven BCP patients and 253 controls were included.Median age was 33 and 35 years, respectively. Both populations were managedsimilarly, except for less frequent sentinel node dissection (p = 0.026) andtaxane administration (p = 0.03) among BCP patients. Median follow-up was 7.5years. Survival rates were similar between both BCP and control patients: 5-year OS rates were 83.1% (95% CI: 74.5-89.0) vs 85.5% (95% CI: 80.4-89.4),respectively, p = 0.31; 5-year DFS rates 60.0% (95% CI: 50.1-68.6) vs 68.5% (95% CI: 62.3-73.9), respectively, p = 0.12 and 5-year MFS rates 71.0% (95% CI:61.3-78.6) and 74.5% (95% CI: 68.6-79.5), respectively, p = 0.21.CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the survival outcomes of patients diagnosedwith BCP were not significantly different as compared to those of matchednon-pregnant controls. A proper management of women diagnosed with BCP iscrucial.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejca.2018.02.030 PMID: 29625257
