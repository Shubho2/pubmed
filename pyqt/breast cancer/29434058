The steps takeninclude compulsory participation in an external quality assurance (EQA)programme, centralized testing, and regular performance audits for laboratories. This review addresses the status of ER/PR and HER2neu testing in India andpossible reasons for the delay in development of guidelines and mandate fortesting in the country. The chief cause of erroneous ER and PR testing in Indiacontinues to be easily correctable issues such as fixation and antigen retrieval,while for HER2neu testing, it is the use of low-cost non-validated antibodies andinterpretative errors. These deficiencies can however, be rectified by (i)distributing the accountability and responsibility to surgeons and oncologist,(ii) certification of centres for testing in oncology, and (iii) initiation of a national EQA system (EQAS) programme that will help with economical solutions andidentifying the centres of excellence and instill a system for reprimand ofpoorly performing laboratories.DOI: 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_896_16 PMCID: PMC5819026PMID: 29434058
