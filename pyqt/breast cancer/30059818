Electronic address:prasad@ohsu.edu.IMPORTANCE: There is broad interest in patients who have exceptional responses tocancer drugs and only one prior systematic review of published case reports.OBJECTIVE: To systematically summarise case reports of patients who have had asuper response to a cancer drug and determine patterns and completeness ofdocumentation.DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a systematic search of biomedicalliterature and hand searches of seven prominent oncology journals. All cases wereadults with cancer in the metastatic or unresectable setting and who wereclassified as having a remarkable response to a drug therapy were included. Ourstudy was conducted between January 2017 and April 2017.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We extracted patient and tumour characteristics,characteristics surrounding the exceptional response and pertinent oncologichistory. Additionally, we noted authors' financial conflicts of interest, ifgiven.RESULTS: We found 180 cases of exceptional response. The most common malignancywas breast cancer (28/180), and the most common class of drug therapy used wastargeted therapies (161/274). The median year of publication was 2015. Depth ofresponse included 33% (61/180) complete response, 55% (100/180) partialresponse and 7.7% (14/180) stable disease. The median length of response to thedrug was 14 months. Fifty-nine percent (107/180) reported a driver mutation, and only 52% (56/107) reported two or more correlative studies. Only 14% (26/180)reported a denominator or total number treated to observe this response. Of casesthat reported duration of response to a previous drug given in the unresectablesetting, 49% demonstrated a progression-free survival ratio of exceptionalresponse to prior line of 1.3 or greater (Von Hoff ratio).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our survey found that exceptional responders tended tohave solid organ malignancies and most received targeted therapies. Many of ourcases of exceptional responders were missing important information about theresponse and key oncologic history. Standardised criteria should be used tomaximise usefulness of these case reports in the future.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejca.2018.06.010 PMID: 30059818
