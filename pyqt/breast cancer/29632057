With equivalent survival outcomes between NAST and up-front surgery, thesituation-specific preference-sensitive nature of the decision makes it suitable for a decision aid (DA). This study aimed to develop and evaluate a DA for thispopulation. Methods: A DA booklet was developed according to internationalstandards, including information about adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment,outcome probabilities, and a values clarification exercise. Eligible women,considered by investigators as candidates for NAST, were enrolled in amulti-institutional, single-arm, longitudinal study. Patient-reported outcomemeasure questionnaires were completed pre- and post-DA, between chemotherapy and surgery, and at 12 months. Outcomes were feasibility (percentage of eligiblepatients accessing the DA); acceptability to patients (percentage who wouldrecommend it to others) and clinicians (percentage who would use the DA inroutine practice); and decision-related outcomes. Results: From 77 eligiblewomen, 59 were enrolled, of whom 47 (79.7%; 95% CI, 69.4-89.9) reported havingread the DA; 51 completed the first post-DA questionnaire. Of these 51, 41participants (80.4%; 95% CI, 69.5-91.3) found the DA useful for their decisionabout NAST. Of 18 responding investigators, 16 (88.9%; 95% CI, 74.4-103.4)indicated they would continue to use the DA in routine practice. Post-DA,decisional conflict decreased significantly (P<.01); anxiety and distressdecreased significantly; and 86.3% (95% CI, 73.7-94.3) achieved at least as much decisional control as they desired. Conclusions: This DA was feasible andacceptable to patients and clinicians, and improvement in decision-relatedoutcomes was demonstrated when used in combination with clinical consultations.This DA could safely be implemented into routine practice for women consideringNAST for operable breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.DOI: 10.6004/jnccn.2017.7063 PMID: 29632057
