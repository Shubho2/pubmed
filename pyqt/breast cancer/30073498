The results were comparedbetween low-risk and non-low-risk DCIS. Associations between quantitative ADCmetrics and low-risk DCIS were evaluated by receiver operating characteristics(ROC) curve and logistic regression analyses.RESULTS: In whole-lesion histogram analysis, mean ADC and 5th, 50th and 95thpercentiles of ADC were significantly different between low-risk and non-low-riskDCIS (1.522, 1.207, 1.536 and 1.854 × 10-3 mm2/s versus 1.270, 0.917, 1.261 and1.657 × 10-3 mm2/s, respectively; p = .004, p = .003, p = .004 and p = .024,respectively). ROC curve analysis for differentiating low-risk DCIS revealed that5th percentile ADC yielded the largest area under the curve (0.786) among themetrics of whole-lesion histogram, and the optimal cut-off point was 1.078 × 10-3mm2/s (sensitivity 80%, specificity 75.9%, p = .001). Multivariate regressionanalysis revealed that a high 5th percentile of ADC (> 1.078× 10-3 mm2/s; oddsratio [OR] = 10.494, p = .016), small tumour size (≤ 2 cm; OR = 12.692, p = .008)and low Ki-67 status (< 14%; OR = 10.879, p = .046) were significantly associatedwith low-risk DCIS.CONCLUSIONS: Assessment with whole-lesion histogram analysis of the ADC could be helpful for identifying patients with low-risk DCIS.KEY POINTS: • Whole-lesion histogram ADC metrics could be helpful fordifferentiating low-risk from non-low-risk DCIS. • A high 5th percentile ADC was a significant factor associated with low-risk DCIS. • Risk stratification of DCISis important for their management.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5666-x PMID: 30073498
