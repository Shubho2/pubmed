The aims of this study are two-fold, firstly, to clarify daily practice treatments for elderly breast cancer patients in Japan, and secondly, to plan aprospective clinical trial to address unresolved clinical questions. Weinvestigated practice care of elderly breast cancer patients in 38 institutionsof the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG). Questionnaires asked: (1) definitionof "elderly" for each treatment, (2) clinical standard anti-HER2 therapy in each age-group, (3) recommended docetaxel dose in each age-group, (4) considerationsfor future clinical trials, and (5) other information about geriatric oncologyconcerning breast cancer. The upper age-limit for surgery and irradiation therapywas generally 80 years, while many physicians considered anti-cytotoxic adjuvant therapy unsuitable for patients >70-75 years. For HER2-positive metastatic breastcancer, 82% of physicians recommended docetaxel (DTX) plus trastuzumab pluspertuzumab (DTP) as standard care for patients aged 65-70, although 54% ofphysicians avoided DTP for those aged 71-75 as first-line standard preference.Most physicians recommended 75 mg/m2 DTX for both 65-70 (63%) and 70-75 (52%)age-groups, but not for those over 75. Many physicians (73%) recommended 60 mg/m2DTX first. Most (97%) agree that the vulnerability of each elderly patient in aclinical trial should be assessed by comprehensive geriatric assessment. This is the first questionnaire study of care patterns for elderly breast cancerpatients. Physicians considered different drug regimens and dosages according to patients' fragility.DOI: 10.18999/nagjms.80.2.217 PMCID: PMC5995731PMID: 29915439
