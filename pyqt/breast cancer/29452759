We evaluated the feasibility of weeklynab-paclitaxel followed by FEC (5-FU [fluorouracil], epirubicin, andcyclophosphamide) treatment feasibility as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breastcancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with no previous chemotherapy wereenrolled to receive nab-paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 the first 3 of 4 weeks (3q4w)followed by FEC as neoadjuvant treatment. The trial was powered for analyses offeasibility.RESULTS: Twenty-five patients completed the treatment as per protocol, and thecompletion rate was 75.8% (95% confidence interval, 59.0-87.2; P = .44). Theregimen completion group was younger than those with regimen incompletion(average 45.1 vs. 56.6 years). The pathological complete response (ypT0-is/N0)rate was 30.3% in 33 patients, which was higher in triple-negative patients(58.3%). Grade 3/4 neutropenia was seen in 48.5%, although there was no febrileneutropenia. Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was seen in 33.3%.CONCLUSION: Our study showed that weekly nab-paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 3q4w followedby FEC as neoadjuvant regimen might be sufficient in efficacy, although with arelatively high severe adverse event occurrence rate.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
