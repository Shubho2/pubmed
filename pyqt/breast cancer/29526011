Here we describe the design, fabrication, and implementationof an array of channels with a range of cross sections to investigate migrationof cells and cell clusters through confined spaces. By combining this assay with a motorized microscope stage, image data can be acquired with high throughput to determine the physical limits of migration in confined environments and theirbiological origin.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7701-7_27 PMID: 29526011
