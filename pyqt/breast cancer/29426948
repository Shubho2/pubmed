A total of29,107 digital mammograms from five institutions (4,339 cancer cases and 24,768normal cases) were included. After matching patients' age, breast density, andequipment, 1,238 and 1,238 cases were chosen as validation and test sets,respectively, and the remainder were used for training. The core algorithm ofDIB-MG is a deep convolutional neural network; a deep learning algorithmspecialized for images. Each sample (case) is an exam composed of 4-view images(RCC, RMLO, LCC, and LMLO). For each case in a training set, the cancerprobability inferred from DIB-MG is compared with the per-case ground-truthlabel. Then the model parameters in DIB-MG are updated based on the error betweenthe prediction and the ground-truth. At the operating point (threshold) of 0.5,sensitivity was 75.6% and 76.1% when specificity was 90.2% and 88.5%, and AUC was0.903 and 0.906 for the validation and test sets, respectively. This researchshowed the potential of DIB-MG as a screening tool for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-21215-1 PMCID: PMC5807343PMID: 29426948
