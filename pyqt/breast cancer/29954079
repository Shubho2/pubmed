According to the definition of metastasis as an incurable disease, todate there are no effective treatments for tumor-associated bone metastases andthis represents a real challenge for the researchers in the field. The bone is a heterogeneous environment that represents a fertile soil for tumor cells,supporting their growth. Among the different cell types present in the bone, inthis review we will focus our attention on the osteoclasts, which are crucialplayers in the so called &ldquo;vicious cycle&rdquo;, a phenomenon triggered bytumor cells eventually leading to both tumor proliferation as well as bonederegulation, thus fueling the development of bone metastasis. The complexnetwork, linking tumor cells to the bone by activating osteoclasts, represents a fruitful target for the treatment of bone metastases. In this review we willdescribe how tumor cells perturb the bone microenvironment by activelyinfluencing osteoclast formation and activity. Moreover, we will describe thecurrent antiresorptive drugs employed in the treatment of bone metastases as wellas new, targeted therapies able to affect both cancer cells and osteoclasts.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10070218 PMCID: PMC6071064PMID: 29954079
