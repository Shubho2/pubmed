In addition, theeffects of biophysical features such as hypoxia [low oxygen (O2)] on cells withinthe TME may lead to tumor evasion. Gamma delta T cells (γδTcs) naturally killtransformed cells and are therefore under development as immunotherapy forvarious cancers. Clinical trials have proven the safety of γδTc immunotherapy andincreased circulating γδTc levels correlate with improved patient outcome. Yet,the function of γδTc tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in human breast cancerremains controversial. Breast tumors can be highly hypoxic, thus therapy must be effective under low O2 conditions. We have found increased infiltration of γδTcin areas of hypoxia in a small cohort of breast tumors; considering theirinherent plasticity, it is important to understand how hypoxia influences γδTcfunction. In vitro, the cell density of expanded primary healthy donorblood-derived human γδTc decreased in response to hypoxia (2% O2) compared tonormoxia (20% O2). However, the secretion of macrophage inflammatory protein 1α(MIP1α)/MIP1β, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted(RANTES), and CD40L by γδTc were increased after 40 h in hypoxia compared tonormoxia concomitant with the stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor 1-alphaprotein. Mechanistically, we determined that natural killer group 2, member D(NKG2D) on γδTc and the NKG2D ligand MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A(MICA)/B on MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines are important for γδTccytotoxicity, but that MIP1α, RANTES, and CD40L do not play a direct role incytotoxicity. Hypoxia appeared to enhance the cytotoxicity of γδTc such thatexposure for 48 h increased cytotoxicity of γδTc against breast cancer cells thatwere maintained in normoxia; conversely, breast cancer lines incubated in hypoxiafor 48 h prior to the assay were largely resistant to γδTc cytotoxicity. MICA/Bsurface expression on both MCF-7 and T47D remained unchanged upon exposure tohypoxia; however, ELISAs revealed increased MICA shedding by MCF-7 under hypoxia,potentially explaining resistance to γδTc cytotoxicity. Despite enhanced γδTccytotoxicity upon pre-incubation in hypoxia, these cells were unable to overcome hypoxia-induced resistance of MCF-7. Thus, such resistance mechanisms employed bybreast cancer targets must be overcome to develop more effective γδTcimmunotherapies.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01367 PMCID: PMC6013583PMID: 29963058
