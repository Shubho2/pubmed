Both kinase-dependent and -independent functions of PTK6in driving tumor growth have been described, therefore targeting PTK6 kinaseactivity by small molecule inhibitors as a therapeutic approach to treat cancers remains to be validated. In this study, we identified novel, potent and selectivePTK6 kinase inhibitors as a means to investigate the role of PTK6 kinase activityin breast tumorigenesis. We report here the crystal structures of apo-PTK6 andinhibitor-bound PTK6 complexes, providing the structural basis for small moleculeinteraction with PTK6. The kinase inhibitors moderately suppress tumor cellgrowth in 2D and 3D cell cultures. However, the tumor cell growth inhibitionshows neither correlation with the PTK6 kinase activity inhibition, nor the totalor activated PTK6 protein levels in tumor cells, suggesting that the tumor cellgrowth is independent of PTK6 kinase activity. Furthermore, in engineered breast tumor cells overexpressing PTK6, the inhibition of PTK6 kinase activity does not parallel the inhibition of tumor cell growth with a >500-fold shift in compoundpotencies (IC50 values). Overall, these findings suggest that the kinase activityof PTK6 does not play a significant role in tumorigenesis, thus providingimportant evidence against PTK6 kinase as a potential therapeutic target forbreast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198374 PMCID: PMC5991704PMID: 29879184
