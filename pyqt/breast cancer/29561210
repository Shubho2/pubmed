In this study,polymer-based nanoparticles (NPs) incorporating the drug have been designed andcharacterized, aimed to control the release, potentially maximize the therapeuticefficiency, and minimize the side effects of the drug. LTZ was incorporated into poly(d,l-lactide) (PDLLA) NPs by employing the emulsion-solvent evaporationtechnique using a range of drug concentrations. Loaded drug and drug-polymerinteractions were studied using X-ray diffraction and NPs morphology wasevaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Particle size distribution(PSD) and zeta potential of the NPs were analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), respectively. Drug content and releaseprofile studies were carried out and determined using ultra performance liquidchromatography (UPLC). The yield of LTZ-PDLLA NPs reached as high as 85%. The NPswere spherical and smooth, regardless of LTZ concentration in the formulation.However, particle size increased from 241.6 ± 1.2 to 348.7 ± 6.1 nm uponincreasing LTZ concentration from 0 to 30% w/w, with entrapment efficienciesreaching up to 96.8%. Drug release from the polymeric matrix was best describedby Higuchi model with a predominant diffusion-based mechanism. More than 15, 46, and 86% of LTZ was released in a controlled fashion over 30 d from the 10, 20,and 30% LTZ-PDLLA NPs, respectively. Overall, LTZ-PDLLA NPs were designed withappropriate size and surface charge, high drug loading, superior entrapmentefficiency, and prolonged release profile.DOI: 10.1080/10837450.2018.1455698 PMID: 29561210
