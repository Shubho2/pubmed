These receptors are reported to activate transcriptionthrough ligand-dependent interactions with co-regulators and are involved in the development of secondary lymphoid tissues, autoimmune diseases, inflammatorydiseases, the circadian rhythm, and metabolism homeostasis. Researches on RORscontributing to cancer-related processes have been growing, and they provideevidence that RORs are likely to be considered as potential therapeutic targetsin many cancers. RORα has been identified as a potential therapeutic target forbreast cancer and has been investigated in melanoma, colorectal colon cancer, andgastric cancer. RORβ is mainly expressed in the central nervous system, but ithas also been studied in pharyngeal cancer, uterine leiomyosarcoma, andcolorectal cancer, in addition to neuroblastoma, and recent studies suggest that RORγ is involved in various cancers, including lymphoma, melanoma, and lungcancer. Some studies found RORγ to be upregulated in cancer tissues compared withnormal tissues, while others indicated the opposite results. With respect to the mechanisms of RORs in cancer, previous studies on the regulatory mechanisms ofRORs in cancer were mostly focused on immune cells and cytokines, but latelythere have been investigations concentrating on RORs themselves. Thus, thisreview summarizes reports on the regulation of RORs in cancer and highlightspotential therapeutic targets in cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01187 PMCID: PMC5990620PMID: 29904382
