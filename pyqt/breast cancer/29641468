Results of studies involving dietary patterns(DPs) and breast or lung cancer risk in European countries outside theMediterranean Sea region are limited and inconclusive. This study aimed todevelop a 'Polish-adapted Mediterranean Diet' ('Polish-aMED') score, and thenstudy the associations between the 'Polish-aMED' score and a posteriori-deriveddietary patterns with breast or lung cancer risk in adult Poles. This pooledanalysis of two case-control studies involved 560 subjects (280 men, 280 women)aged 40-75 years from Northeastern Poland. Diagnoses of breast cancer in 140women and lung cancer in 140 men were found. The food frequency consumption of 21selected food groups was collected using a 62-item Food Frequency Questionnaire(FFQ)-6. The 'Polish-adapted Mediterranean Diet' score which included eightitems-vegetables, fruit, whole grain, fish, legumes, nuts and seeds-as well asthe ratio of vegetable oils to animal fat and red and processed meat wasdeveloped (range: 0-8 points). Three DPs were identified in a Principal ComponentAnalysis: 'Prudent', 'Non-healthy', 'Dressings and sweetened-low-fat dairy'. In amultiple logistic regression analysis, two models were created: crude, andadjusted for age, sex, type of cancer, Body Mass Index (BMI), socioeconomicstatus (SES) index, overall physical activity, smoking status and alcohol abuse. The risk of breast or lung cancer was lower in the average (3-5 points) and high (6-8 points) levels of the 'Polish-aMED' score compared to the low (0-2 points)level by 51% (odds ratio (OR): 0.49; 95% confidence interval (Cl): 0.30-0.80; p <0.01; adjusted) and 63% (OR: 0.37; 95% Cl: 0.21-0.64; p < 0.001; adjusted),respectively. In the middle and upper tertiles compared to the bottom tertile of the 'Prudent' DP, the risk of cancer was lower by 38-43% (crude) but was notsignificant after adjustment for confounders. In the upper compared to the bottomtertile of the 'Non-healthy' DP, the risk of cancer was higher by 65% (OR: 1.65; 95% Cl: 1.05-2.59; p < 0.05; adjusted). In conclusion, the Polish adaptation ofthe Mediterranean diet could be considered for adults living in non-Mediterraneancountries for the prevention of the breast or lung cancers. Future studies shouldexplore the role of a traditional Mediterranean diet fitted to local dietarypatterns of non-Mediterranean Europeans in cancer prevention.DOI: 10.3390/nu10040470 PMCID: PMC5946255PMID: 29641468
