[Epub ahead of print]FGFR4 provides the conduit to facilitate FGF19 signaling in breast cancerprogression.Zhao X(1)(2), Xu F(3), Dominguez NP(2)(4), Xiong Y(2), Xiong Z(3), Peng H(1),Shay C(5)(6), Teng Y(2)(7).Author information: (1)Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Guangdong SecondProvincial General Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.(2)Department of Oral Biology, Dental College of Georgia, Augusta University,Augusta, GA, USA.(3)Breast Cancer Center, Chongqing Cancer Institute & Hospital, Chongqing, China.(4)Institute of Biomedicine, University of León, León, Spain.(5).The Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.(6).Emory Children's Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.(7).Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA.Although genetic amplification and overexpression of the fibroblast growth factor19 (FGF19) gene are found in human breast cancer, mechanisms that contribute tosuch functional alterations remain elusive. We report here that high expressionof FGF19 is associated with the aggressive malignant behavior and poor survivaloutcome of breast cancer patients. FGF19 is particularly highly expressed inluminal molecular subtype of breast tumors and its expression levels arepositively associated with its secretion levels from breast cancer cells. Geneticknockout of FGF19 significantly induces repression of breast tumor progressionand metastasis in either an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer or anexperimental metastasis model. The FGF19 specific receptor, FGFR4, can beactivated and subsequently upregulate AKT signaling in breast cancer cell uponFGF19, which is critical for oncogenic role of FGF19. Inactivation of FGFR4 byits inhibitor BLU9931 significantly attenuates FGF19-induced tumor-promotingactivity, suggesting interruption of FGFR4 function is sufficient to affectFGF19-driven breast cancer. Overall, these insights support the idea thattargeting FGFR4 in breast cancer cells overexpressing FGF19 may represent aneffective strategy to suppress cancer development, progression, and metastasis.This article is protected by copyright.
