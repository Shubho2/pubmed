Electronic address:jmoreira@ff.uc.pt.A major challenge in the management of breast cancer disease has been thedevelopment of metastases. Finding new molecular targets and the design oftargeted therapeutic approaches to improve the overall survival and quality oflife of these patients is, therefore, of great importance. Nucleolin, which isoverexpressed in cancer cells and tumor-associated blood vessels, have beenimplicated in various processes supporting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis.Additionally, its overexpression has been demonstrated in a variety of humanneoplasias as an unfavorable prognostic factor, associated with a high risk ofrelapse and low overall survival. Hence, nucleolin has emerged as a relevanttarget for therapeutic intervention in cancer malignancy, including breastcancer. This review focus on the contribution of nucleolin for cancer disease andon the development of therapeutic strategies targeting this protein. In thisrespect, it also provides a critical analysis about the potential and pitfalls ofnanomedicine for cancer therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
