We prospectively examined psychosocial outcomes before andup to 18 months after surgery in women who did or did not have CPM. Methods Womenwith unilateral, nonhereditary breast cancer completed questionnaires before and 1, 6, 12, and 18 months after surgery. Primary psychosocial measures were cancer worry and cancer-specific distress. Secondary measures were body image, qualityof life (QOL), decisional satisfaction, and decisional regret. Results A total of288 women (mean age, 56 years; 58% non-Hispanic white) provided questionnairedata, of whom 50 underwent CPM. Before surgery, women who subsequently receivedCPM had higher cancer distress ( P = .04), cancer worry ( P < .001), and bodyimage concerns ( P < .001) than women who did not have CPM. In a multivariablerepeated measures model adjusted for time, age, race/ethnicity, and stage, CPMwas associated with more body image distress ( P < .001) and poorer QOL ( P =.02). There was a significant interaction between time point and CPM group forcancer worry ( Pinteraction < .001), suggesting that CPM patients had higherpresurgery cancer worry, but their postsurgery worry decreased over time and was similar to the worry of patients who did not have CPM. QOL was similar betweenCPM groups before surgery but declined 1 month after surgery and remained lowerthan patients who did not have CPM after surgery ( Pinteraction = .05).Conclusion These results may facilitate informed discussions between women andtheir physicians regarding CPM. Fear and worry may be foremost concerns at thetime surgical decisions are made, when women may not anticipate the adversefuture effect of CPM on body image and QOL.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2018.78.6442 PMID: 30044695
