However, thedevelopment of effective therapies for breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) islimited by an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms governing drugsensitivity in the central nervous system. Pharmacodynamic data from patients andin vivo models suggest that inadequate drug penetration across the "blood-tumor" barrier is not the whole story. Using HER2-positive BCBMs as a case study, wehighlight recent data from orthotopic brain metastasis models that implicatebrain-specific drug resistance mechanisms in BCBMs and suggest a translationalresearch paradigm to guide drug development for treatment of BCBMs. Clin CancerRes; 24(8); 1795-804. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-3351 PMCID: PMC5899637 [Available on 2019-04-15]PMID: 29437794
