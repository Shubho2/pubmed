All patients that had SLNB for primary treatment of breast cancer between January 2012 and March 2016were identified. Clinicopathologic factors were used to compare the number of LNsand rates of node positivity.RESULTS: One thousand six hundred and three patients were included. The averagenumber of SLNs, non-SLNs, and total LNs was 2.53, 0.54, 3.08, respectively.Significantly more LNs were removed in age <40 versus age >40 (3.73, 3.04P < 0.01), invasive versus DCIS (3.13, 2.73 P < 0.001), Grade III versus Grade II(3.42, 2.99 P < 0.01), T2 versus T1 (3.40, 2.96 P < 0.01), and ER- versus ER+(3.45, 3.05 P < 0.05). SLN positivity was significantly higher (P < 0.05) ininvasive versus DCIS (27%, 4%), T2 versus T1 (30%. 17%), Grade II versus Grade I (42%, 18%), and ILC versus IDC (38%, 26%).CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in the number of lymph nodesremoved at SLNB in certain groups however; node positivity was not necessarilyhigher in these groups. Surgeons must be cognizant of potential bias whenperforming SLNB.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jso.25010 PMID: 29484663  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
