China.Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer‑associated mortalities inwomen. Tamoxifen (TAM) is an endocrine therapy commonly used in the treatment of patients with breast cancer expressing estrogen receptor α. However, treatmentoften ends in failure due to the emergence of drug resistance. MicroRNAs(miRNAs), a family of small non‑coding RNAs, serve critical roles in theregulation of gene expression and cell events. To date, whether miRNA‑663b could mediate TAM resistance in breast cancer remains unknown. Therefore, the aim ofthe present study was to investigate the role of miRNA‑663b in TAM resistance in breast cancer. The results demonstrated that miRNA‑663b was upregulated in breastcancer with TAM resistance. Tumor protein 73 (TP73) was a direct target ofmiRNA‑663b, and was negatively regulated by miRNA‑663b in MCF‑7 cells.Furthermore, it was identified that downregulation of miRNA‑663b inhibited cellproliferation ability and promoted cell apoptosis, resulting in enhanced TAMsensitivity. In addition, these findings suggested that TP73 silencing may haveeliminated the effects of miRNA‑663b inhibitor on breast cancer cells. Inconclusion, the present study verified a novel molecular link between miRNA‑663b and TP73, and indicated that miRNA‑663b may be a critical therapeutic target inbreast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9064 PMID: 29845295
