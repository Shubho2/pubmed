In ourstudy, we present long-term outcomes of treatment among SLN(+) patients referred for conservative treatment, for example, no further ALND. A total of 3145 breast cancer patients subjected to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between November2008 and June 2015. SLN metastases were identified in 719 patients (22.9%).Locoregional recurrences and distant metastases as endpoints were distinquished. The mean follow-up time for patients after ALND was 36.2 months (6-74 months);18.8 months (6-38 months) for patients with SLN macrometastases without ALND; and34.0 months (6-74 months) for patients with micrometastases. Adjuvant ALND wasperformed in 626 of SLN(+) patients. Conservative treatment was applied in theremaining 93 cases. Among SLN(+) patients without adjuvant ALND, there was onecase of recurrence (1.07%). In the group of patients without SLN, metastasesrecurrence was noted in 32 patients (1.32%). Among SLN(+) patients diagnosed withmacrometastases, recurrence concerned 2.01% of analyzed cases (all subjected toALND). Lack of radical surgical treatment in SLN(+) breast cancer patients didnot lead to worsening long-term outcomes. In the occurrence of macrometastases tothe sentinel lymph node, abandoning completion axillary lymph node dissectionmight be a reasonable option. However, it would require continuation of currentresearch, preferably involving a clinical trial.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.12997 PMID: 29476570
