Supervisedmachine-learning was used to identify parameters that predict persistence ofsignificant pain.METHODS: Over 500 demographic, clinical and psychological parameters wereacquired up to 6 months after surgery from 1,000 women (aged 28-75 years) whowere treated for breast cancer. Pain was assessed using an 11-point numericalrating scale before surgery and at months 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36. The ratings atmonths 12, 24, and 36 were used to allocate patents to either "persisting pain"or "non-persisting pain" groups. Unsupervised machine learning was applied to mapthe parameters to these diagnoses.RESULTS: A symbolic rule-based classifier tool was created that comprised 21single or aggregated parameters, including demographic features, psychologicaland pain-related parameters, forming a questionnaire with "yes/no" items(decision rules). If at least 10 of the 21 rules applied, persisting pain waspredicted at a cross-validated accuracy of 86% and a negative predictive value ofapproximately 95%.CONCLUSIONS: The present machine-learned analysis showed that, even with a large set of parameters acquired from a large cohort, early identification of thesepatients is only partly successful. This indicates that more parameters areneeded for accurate prediction of persisting pain. However, with the currentparameters it is possible, with a certainty of almost 95%, to exclude thepossibility of persistent pain developing in a woman being treated for breastcancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4841-8 PMID: 29876695
