To address these challenges, we developed a nanocomposite consisting ofchemically-reduced graphene oxide combined with manganese-doped zinc sulfidequantum dots and functionalized with folic acid (FA-rGO/ZnS:Mn). We studied thedispersion stability, Doxorubicin (DOX) loading and release efficiency, targetspecificity, internalization, and biocompatibility of FA-rGO/ZnS:Mn againstfolate-rich breast cancer cells, and compared to its uncoated counterpart(rGO/ZnS:Mn). The results indicate that DOX is adsorbed on the graphene surfacevia &pi;‚Åª&pi; stacking and hydrophobic interaction, with enhanced loading (~35%) and entrapment (~60%) efficiency that are associated to the chelation of DOX and surface Zn2+ ions. DOX release is favored under acidic conditions reaching arelease of up to 95% after 70 h. Membrane integrity of the cells assessed byLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release indicate that the surface passivation caused by folic acid (FA) functionalization decreases the strong hydrophobic interactionbetween the cell membrane wall and the edges/corners of graphene flakes.Chemotherapeutic effect assays reveal that the cancer cell viability was reduced up to ~50% at 3 &micro;g/mL of DOX-FA-rGO/ZnS:Mn exposure, which is morepronounced than those obtained for free DOX at the same doses. Moreover,DOX-rGO/ZnS:Mn did not show any signs of toxicity. An opposite trend was observedfor cells that do not overexpress the folate receptors, indicating that FAfunctionalization endows rGO/ZnS:Mn with an effective ability to discriminatepositive folate receptor cancerous cells, enhancing its drug loading/releaseefficiency as a compact drug delivery system (DDS). This study paves the way for the potential use of functionalized rGO/ZnS:Mn nanocomposite as a platform fortargeted cancer treatment.DOI: 10.3390/nano8070484 PMCID: PMC6071040PMID: 29966355
