In addition, TNBC is overrepresented in premenopausal African Americanwomen. Using grounded theory as the qualitative methodological approach, thepresent article elucidates unique biopsychosocial challenges and needs of youngAfrican American women with TNBC. A study group of six women with TNBC and acomparison group of six women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer were interviewed longitudinally over three time points throughout the cancer treatmenttrajectory. Major themes that were unique to the study group of women with TNBCinclude (a) longer, more aggressive treatment trajectories; (b) more difficultstruggles with feminine identity; (c) the presence of fertility and parentingissues; (d) higher burdens of care; (e) barriers to separation and individuation as a maturation milestone; and (f) feeling out of place compared with peers.These themes provide a foundation to inform how social workers care for thisunderserved group of women.DOI: 10.1093/hsw/hly006 PMID: 29481665
