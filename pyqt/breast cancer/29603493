However, important biomarkers for BC metastasisremain largely undefined. In the present study, we identified that longnon-coding RNA-CTD-2108O9.1 is downregulated in BC tissues and cells and acts as a metastatic inhibitor of BC. Mechanistic investigation determined thatlncRNA-CTD-2108O9.1 represses metastasis by targeting leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), which is designated as a metastasis suppressor in BC. Our study characterizes a significant tumor suppressor active in BC metastasis repressionthrough the known metastasis inhibitor LIFR.Â© 2018 The Authors.
