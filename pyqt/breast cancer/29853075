Electronic address: mkuraji@gmail.com.New morpholine derived Schiff base ligands (HL1 and HL2) and their Cu(II)complexes [Cu(L1)2] (1) and [Cu(L2)2] (2) have been synthesized and characterizedby 1H NMR, IR, UV-Vis, EPR studies and cyclic voltammetric analyses. Singlecrystal X-ray crystallography studies confirm the structure of newly synthesized Schiff base ligands HL1and HL2. The ground state electronic structures of Cu(II) complexes 1 and 2 have been investigated by DFT/B3LYP theoretical analysis with6-31G (d,p) and LANL2DZ basis set. The affinity towards DNA and protein moleculeshave been evaluated using computational docking analysis and complex 2 exposesignificant binding ability with DNA as well as protein due to its toweringhydrophobicity. Consequently, complex 2 reveals superior antibacterial activityagainst some bacterial species besides anticancer activity on human breast cancer(MCF-7) cells than complex 1 and Schiff base ligands (HL1 and HL2). Thesepreliminary investigations strongly recommended that complex 2 can be used as abetter antibacterial plus anticancer agent.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
