Electronicaddress: rcxjs@upm.edu.my.PURPOSE: Nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) of docetaxel constitute an extraburden in the treatment of cancer patients and necessitate either a dosereduction or an outright switch of docetaxel for other regimens. These AEs arefrequently associated with genetic polymorphisms of genes encoding for proteinsinvolved docetaxel disposition. Therefore, we investigated that association inMalaysian breast cancer patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 110 Malaysian breast cancer patients wereenrolled in the present study, and their blood samples were investigated fordifferent single nucleotide polymorphisms using polymerase chain reactionrestriction fragment length polymorphism. AEs were evaluated using the CommonTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.RESULTS: Fatigue, nausea, oral mucositis, and vomiting were the most commonnonhematologic AEs. Rash was associated with heterozygous and mutant genotypes ofABCB1 3435C>T (P < .05). Moreover, patients carrying the GG genotype of ABCB12677G>A/T reported more fatigue than those carrying the heterozygous genotype GA (P < .05). The presence of ABCB1 3435-T, ABCC2 3972-C, ABCC2 1249-G, and ABCB12677-G alleles was significantly associated with nausea and oral mucositis. Thecoexistence of ABCB1 3435-C, ABCC2 3972-C, ABCC2 1249-G, and ABCB1 2677-A wassignificantly associated with vomiting (P < .05).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of nonhematologic AEs in breast cancer patientstreated with docetaxel has been relatively high. The variant allele of ABCB13435C>T polymorphism could be a potential predictive biomarker ofdocetaxel-induced rash, and homozygous wild-type ABCB1 2677G>A/T might predictfor a greater risk of fatigue. In addition, the concurrent presence of specificalleles could be predictive of vomiting, nausea, and oral mucositis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
