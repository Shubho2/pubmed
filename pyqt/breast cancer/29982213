The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility ofSipjeondaebo-tang for cancer-related fatigue.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The present study is a randomised, double-blind,placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Forty-eight patients with breast cancer whoare indicated for doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide will be recruited. Theparticipants will receive 3 g of Sipjeondaebo-tang or a placebo three times a dayfor 56 days. The primary outcome measurement is the change in the Brief FatigueInventory scores. The secondary outcome measurements include the changes in theVisual Analogue Scale (VAS) of fatigue, and quality of life measured by theEuropean Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23. VAS of fatigue will be measured on every visit, and other outcomes will bemeasured on visits 2, 4, 6 and 7. The total study period is 14 weeks.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the InstitutionalReview Board of the Catholic Kwandong University International St Mary's Hospital(reference IS16MNSI0011).
