China.Natural plants offer a treasure trove of resources for anticancer drugdevelopment. Clematis are widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. However,studies on the active substances in Clematis are scarce. In the present study,four monomer compounds were successfully extracted from this species and theirinhibitory effects on the growth of breast cancer cells were investigated usingbioactivity tests. Among them, Clematis hederagenin saponin (CHS) belongs to the class of triterpenoid saponins. CHS showed cytotoxic effects on breast cancercells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The compound also induced apoptosisin breast cancer cells in a time-dependent manner. Further investigation into theunderlying mechanisms of apoptosis induction in breast cancer cells showed thatthe compound significantly reduced mitochondrial Apaf-1 and cytochrome c proteinsin breast cancer cells. In addition, it upregulated the activities of caspase-3and -9. In conclusion, CHS induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells throughregulation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The results suggest that thehederagenin saponin extracted from Clematis ganpiniana offers great potential as a novel anti-breast cancer drug.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7494 PMCID: PMC5774383PMID: 29434869
