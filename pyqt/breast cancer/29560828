Despite the availability of large-scale methods for analyzing PPInetworks, these methods often focused on PPI networks using genome-scale dataand/or known experimental PPIs. However, these methods are unable to providestructurally resolved interaction residues and their conservations in PPInetworks.RESULTS: Here, we reconstructed a human three-dimensional (3D) structural PPInetwork (hDiSNet) with the detailed atomic binding models and disease-associated mutations by enhancing our PPI families and 3D-domain interologs from 60,618structural complexes and complete genome database with 6,352,363 proteinsequences across 2274 species. hDiSNet is a scale-free network (γ = 2.05), which consists of 5177 proteins and 19,239 PPIs with 5843 mutations. These 19,239structurally resolved PPIs not only expanded the number of PPIs compared topresent structural PPI network, but also achieved higher agreement with geneontology similarities and higher co-expression correlation than the ones of181,868 experimental PPIs recorded in public databases. Among 5843 mutations,1653 and 790 mutations involved in interacting domains and contacting residues,respectively, are highly related to diseases. Our hDiSNet can provide detailedatomic interactions of human disease and their associated proteins withmutations. Our results show that the disease-related mutations are often located at the contacting residues forming the hydrogen bonds or conserved in the PPIfamily. In addition, hDiSNet provides the insights of the FGFR (EGFR)-MAPKpathway for interpreting the mechanisms of breast cancer and ErbB signalingpathway in brain cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that hDiSNet can explore structural-basedinteractions insights for understanding the mechanisms of disease-associatedproteins and their mutations. We believe that our method is useful to reconstructstructurally resolved PPI networks for interpreting structural genomics anddisease associations.DOI: 10.1186/s12918-018-0537-2 PMCID: PMC5861491PMID: 29560828
