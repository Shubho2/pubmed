From the Section of Plastic Surgery,University of Michigan Health System; and the Department of Plastic Surgery, The Johns Hopkins Hospital.BACKGROUND: Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy may be unnecessary from anoncologic perspective; therefore, the debate persists about the value ofcontralateral prophylactic mastectomy in women with early-stage unilateral breastcancer. Given finite health care resources, this study aims to evaluate the cost of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy and breast reconstruction.METHODS: Women with unilateral breast cancer undergoing either unilateralmastectomy or unilateral mastectomy with contralateral prophylactic mastectomyand immediate breast reconstruction were selected from the Truven MarketScandatabases between 2009 and 2013. Demographic and treatment data were recorded,and over an 18-month follow-up period, the treatment cost was tallied. Alog-transformed linear model was used to compare cost between the groups.RESULTS: A total of 2343 women were identified who met our inclusion criteria,with 1295 undergoing unilateral mastectomy and 1048 undergoing contralateralprophylactic mastectomy. Complication rates within 18 months were similar forwomen undergoing unilateral mastectomy and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (39 percent versus 42 percent; p = 0.17). Management with unilateral mastectomywith reconstruction required an adjusted cumulative mean cost of $33,557.Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction was an additional$11,872 in expenditure (p < 0.001). The cost of initial procedures (meandifference, $6467) and secondary procedures (mean difference, $2455) were thegreatest contributors to cost.CONCLUSIONS: In women with unilateral breast cancer, contralateral prophylacticmastectomy with reconstruction is more costly. The increased monetary cost ofcontralateral prophylactic mastectomy may be offset by improved quality of life. However, this financial reality is an important consideration when ongoingefforts toward reimbursement reform may not pay for contralateral prophylacticmastectomy if outcomes data are not presented to justify this procedure.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004272 PMCID: PMC5922428 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29659447
