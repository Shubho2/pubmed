The anti-proliferative effectof the compound HTMF was confirmed using MTT cytotoxicity assay. Increasedapoptotic induction by HTMF was demonstrated by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) and Hoechst 33258 staining studies. The phosphatidylserinetranslocation, an early feature of apoptosis and DNA damage were revealed throughAnnexinV-Cy3 staining and comet assay. Moreover, the significant elevation ofcellular ROS was observed in the treated cells, as measured by 2,7-diacetyldichlorofluorescein (DCFH-DA). The mRNA expression studies also supported theeffectiveness of HTMF by shifting the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio. The treatment of MCF-7cells with HTMF encouraged apoptosis through the modulation of apoptotic markers,such as p53, Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved PARP. In silico molecular docking anddynamics studies with MDM2-p53 protein revealed that HTMF was more potentcompound that could inhibit the binding of MDM2 with p53 and, therefore, couldtrigger apoptosis in cancer cell. Overall, this study brings up scientificevidence for the efficacy of HTMF against MCF-7 breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1080/10799893.2018.1468780 PMID: 29734849
