The naturalproduct oridonin maintains an impressive pharmacological profile through itscovalent enone warhead on the D-ring and has attracted substantial SAR studies tocharacterize its potential in the development of new molecular entities for thetreatment of various human cancers and inflammation. Herein, for the first time, we report the excessive reactivity of this covalent warhead and mediation of the covalent binding capability through a Rh2(esp)2-catalyzed mild and concise regio-and stereospecific aziridination approach. Importantly, aziridonin 44 (YD0514),with a more-druglike irreversible covalent warhead, has been identified tosignificantly induce apoptosis and inhibit colony formation againsttriple-negative breast cancer with enhanced antitumor effects in vitro and invivo while displaying lower toxicity to normal human mammary epithelial cells in comparison to oridonin.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01514 PMID: 29528645
