Unfortunately, about 50% of patients relapse duringtreatment. Promoter hypermethylation contributes to the epigenetic modulation of tamoxifen resistance-related genes. To evaluate the contribution of DNMTsexpression and their promoter methylation as diagnostic biomarkers in developmentof breast malignancy and tamoxifen resistance, the present study was designed and107 breast tumors and normal breast tissues were recruited. Methylation-specific high-resolution melt curve analysis and quantitative RT-PCR were performed toevaluate DNMTs promoter methylation and mRNA expression, respectively. Ourresults indicated that DNMT3A and DNMT3B promoters were demethylated in breasttumors as compared to control tissues. The mRNA expression levels of all threeDNMTs were significantly increased in tumor specimens in comparison to controltissues (p < 0.05). Among tumor tissues, DNMT3A promoter methylation wassignificantly higher in tamoxifen sensitive patients (p = 0.001). Overexpression of DNMT3A (p = 0.037) and DNMT3B (p < 0.001) mRNA were observed in tamoxifenresistance group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that lowmethylation status of DNMT3A and overexpression of DNMT3B could be as independentpredictors of disease recurrence. Multivariate Cox regression analysis, revealed that high methylation status of DNMT3A could be an independent and favorablepredictor for disease free survival (p = 0.002) and overall survival (p = 0.026);high expression of DNMT1 (p = 0.03) remained significant and unfavorablepredictive factor for overall survival. In conclusion, our data for the firsttime indicated that low methylation status of DNMT3A promoter and overexpression of DNMT3B could contribute to disease recurrence in tamoxifen-treated breastcancer patients.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26562 PMID: 29574992
