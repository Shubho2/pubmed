This study analyzes the association between serum25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and breast cancer risk by pathologic subtype, stageat diagnosis and specific breast cancer risk factors. We conducted apopulation-based multicase-control study where 546 histologically-confirmedbreast cancer cases and 558 population controls, frequently matched by geographicarea, age and body mass index, were recruited in 12 Spanish provinces(MCC-Spain). Information was collected by a questionnaire and plasma 25(OH)D was measured by solid-phase extraction on-line coupled to liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS). Odds ratios and 95%confidence intervals were calculated using logistic and multinomial mixedregression models. We found a clear protective effect between 25(OH)D levels and breast cancer risk, with a significant dose-response trend (OR per10 nmol/L = 0.88; 95%CI = 0.82-0.94). While no differences were observed between pre and postmenopausal women, stage at diagnosis, or across strata of the mainbreast cancer risk factors, the protection was more pronounced for triplenegative tumors (OR per 10 nmol/L = 0.64; p-heterogeneity = 0.038). Similarresults were observed when only cases sampled in the first month after diagnosis were considered. The protective effect of vitamin D on breast cancer risk may be subtype specific, being stronger for more aggressive tumors, which provides a newapproach to prevent this disease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
