It is associated with a poor prognosis and typically earlieronset of metastasis in comparison with other breast cancer subtypes. Since TNBClacks the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and Her2 status isalso negative, there is currently no target that can be used for systemictherapy. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in tumorprogression and metastasis. In this study, we examined a subset of EMT markersconsisting of Snail, Twist-1 and Lox in TNBC and non-TNBC breast cancer subtypes and analyzed their expression pattern in regard to subtype, clinico-pathological parameters and prognosis.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed 659 breast cancer samples from two tissuemicroarrays. Breast cancer samples were categorized into two groups according to hormone receptor expression and Her2 status (n = 146 were triple negative,n = 513 were non triple-negative). Immunohistochemical expression of Snail,Twist-1 and Lox was semi-quantitatively analyzed using a three-tiered(weak-moderate-strong) scoring system. Results were statistically analyzed andcorrelated to clinico-pathological parameters and overall survival.RESULTS: Strong overexpression of Lox was significantly higher in triple negativebreast cancers when compared to non triple-negative breast cancers (p < 0.001).No difference was seen between the groups regarding Snail and Twist expression(p > 0.05). In addition, Lox expression was significantly stronger in poorlydifferentiated (G3) breast cancers (p < 0.001 for Lox).CONCLUSIONS: The EMT marker Lox has a differential expression pattern in breastcancer, being significantly overexpressed in triple negative breast cancers. Wecould not link this expression to prognosis, however, this marker might beexplored in future studies as possible target for systemic therapy of TNBC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
