It is the most common cancer in humans following lung cancer, and itis the most common cancer type resulting in mortality in women. Geneticpolymorphisms are among the genetic factors that play an important role in thedevelopment of the breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigatethe effect of five functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of hTERT(rs2736109 G&gt;A, rs2735940 T&gt;C, rs2853669 A&gt;G, rs2736098 G&gt;A, andrs2736100 T&gt;G) on susceptibility to BC in Turkish population. The genotypefrequency of hTERT rs2736109 G&gt;A, rs2735940 T&gt;C, rs2853669 A&gt;G,rs2736098 G&gt;A, and rs2736100 T&gt;G polymorphisms were determined by using apolymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) andTaqMan methods in 123 subjects with GC and 122 healthy control subjects. The meanage value of the BC patients was 51.58±11.28 (among them 8 subjects ≤35 and 115subjects &gt;35). In this study, it was found that there was no statisticaldifference between hTERT rs2736109 G&gt;A, rs2735940 T&gt;C, rs2853669 A&gt;G,rs2736098 G&gt;A, and rs2736100 T&gt;G polymorphisms that can be associated with risk of BC.PMID: 29506639
