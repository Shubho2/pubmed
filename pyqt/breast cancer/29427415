In vitro studies havedemonstrated that CCR8 expression is regulated by TCR engagement and the skintissue microenvironment. To extend these observations, we examined therelationship between CCR8+ and CCR8- skin T cells in vivo. Phenotypic,functional, and transcriptomic analyses revealed that CCR8+ skin T cells bear allthe hallmarks of resident memory T cells, including homeostatic proliferation in response to IL-7 and IL-15, surface expression of tissue localization (CD103) andretention (CD69) markers, low levels of inhibitory receptors (programmed celldeath protein 1, Tim-3, LAG-3), and a lack of senescence markers (CD57, killercell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1). In contrast, CCR8- skin T cells are heterogeneous and comprise variable numbers of exhausted (programmed celldeath protein 1+), senescent (CD57+, killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily Gmember 1+), and effector (T-bethi, Eomeshi) T cells. Importantly, conventionaland high-throughput sequencing of expressed TCR β-chain (TRB) gene rearrangementsshowed that these CCR8-defined populations are clonotypically distinct,suggesting unique ontogenies in response to separate antigenic challenges and/or stimulatory conditions. Moreover, CCR8+ and CCR8- skin T cells werephenotypically stable in vitro and displayed similar levels of telomere erosion, further supporting the likelihood of a nonlinear differentiation pathway. On the basis of these results, we propose that long-lived memory T cells in human skincan be defined by the expression of CCR8.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1701377 PMCID: PMC5818732PMID: 29427415
