Electronicaddress: hamid.ghandehari@utah.edu.Tunable glutathione (GSH)-sensitive hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles(HMSiO2 NPs) were developed using a structural difference-based selective etchingstrategy. These organosilica hollow nanoparticles contained disulfide linkages(S-S) in the outer shell which were degraded by GSH. The particles were compared with their nonGSH-sensitive tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) HMSiO2 counterpartsin terms of their synthesis method, characterization, doxorubicin (DOX) releaseprofile, and in vitro cytotoxicity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Transmissionelectron microscopy (TEM) of the particles indicated that the fabricated HMSiO2NPs had an average diameter of 130 ± 5 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)revealed that GSH-sensitive particles had approximately 5.3% more weight lossthan TEOS HMSiO2 NPs. Zeta potential of these redox-responsive particles was-23 ± 1 mV at pH 6 in deionized (DI) water. Nitrogen adsorption-desorptionisotherm revealed that the surface area of the hollow mesoporous nanoreservoirswas roughly 446 ± 6 m2 g-1 and the average diameter of the pores was2.3 ± 0.5 nm. TEM images suggest that the nanoparticles started to lose massintegrity from Day 1. The particles showed a high loading capacity for DOX(8.9 ± 0.5%) as a model drug, due to the large voids existing in the hollowstructures. Approximately 58% of the incorporated DOX released within 14 days in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 6 and in the presence of 10 mM of GSH,mimicking intracellular tumor microenvironment while release from TEOS HMSiO2 NPswas only c.a. 18%. The uptake of these hollow nanospheres by MCF-7 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages was evaluated using TEM and confocal microscopy. Thenanospheres were shown to accumulate in the endolysosomal compartments afterincubation for 24 h with the maximum uptake of c.a. 2.1 ± 0.3% and 5.2 ± 0.4%,respectively. Cytotoxicity of the nanospheres was investigated using CCK-8 assay.Results indicate that intact hollow particles (both GSH-sensitive and TEOS HMSiO2NPs) were nontoxic to MCF-7 cells after incubation for 24 h within theconcentration range of 0-1000 μg ml-1. DOX-loaded GSH-sensitive nanospherescontaining 6 μg ml-1 of DOX killed c.a. 51% of MCF-7 cells after 24 h while TEOS HMSiO2 NPs killed c.a. 20% with the difference being statistically significant.Finally, cytotoxicity data in RAW 264.7 macrophages and NIH 3 T3 fibroblastsshows that intact GSH-sensitive HMSiO2 NPs did not show any toxic effects onthese cells with the concentrations equal or <125 μg ml-1.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
