Humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is positive in about 20% all breastcancer patients and considered as a poor prognostic factor. The advent ofant-HER2 therapy has prominently prolonged the time of disease progression andsurvival for HER2-positive MBC patients. This review summarizes the advance inanti-HER2 therapy in HER2-positive MBC according to the phase III clinicaltrials, and briefly discusses some new agents and anti-HER2 therapy for HER2low-or non-expression breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.21037/cco.2018.05.04 PMID: 30056729
