Patients with pCR had an excellent prognosis regardlessof the ER status. In patients with residual disease (no pCR), the recurrence and death rate were higher in ER- and low ER+ cases compared with moderate and highER+ cases.Conclusions: Low ER+ breast cancers are biologically similar to ER- tumors.Semiquantitative ER H-score is an important determinant of response toneoadjuvant chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1093/ajcp/aqy028 PMID: 29741562
