Previous studies showed that induction of autophagy and deficiency innitric oxide (NO) generation contributed to apoptotic cell death in L-A03-treatedMCF-7 cells. However, the detailed mechanism is still unclear. In this study, therole of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in this apoptotic process wasinvestigated. L-A03 (7.5-30 μM) selectively inhibited the activation of c-JunN-terminal protein kinase (JNK) with no significant effect on extracellularsignal related kinase (ERK) and p38. In addition, the possible mechanism ofinteraction between JNK and L-A03 was also investigated by molecular docking. In the presence of SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor, induction of autophagy andapoptosis with L-A03 at 15 μM were elevated, but NO generation was attenuated,indicating that JNK inactivation is essential for apoptotic cell death.Interestingly, autophagy induction and NO generation did not affect theactivation of JNK, demonstrating that JNK is upstream to autophagy and NO. Taken together, L-A03-induced JNK inactivation enhances autophagic and apoptotic celldeath, but represses the generation of NO. This study provides a new insight onthe mechanism of L-A03-induced cell death by targeting JNK.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
