Several internaland external factors can influence this population, and shifts in theircomposition, have been demonstrated to contribute and affect different diseases. During dysbiosis several bacteria related to inflammation, one of the mostnecessary factors in carcinogenesis; it has been shown that some bacterialstrains through deregulation of different signals/pathways may affect tumordevelopment through the production of many factors. Gut microbiota might beconsidered as a holistic hub point for cancer development: direct and indirectinvolvements have been studying in several neoplasms such as colon rectal cancer,hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer. This review discuss over the evidenceof crosstalk between gut microbiota and cancer, its ability to modulatechemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy, and the possibility that theintestinal microbial is a new target for therapeutic approaches to improve theprognosis and quality of life of cancer patients.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24681 PMCID: PMC5915165PMID: 29707157
