Although many of the side effects are transient andnon-life-threatening, their onset is painful and can lower a patient's quality oflife (QoL). This retrospective study was performed to identify predictive factorsof the development of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome in order to developfuture strategies for improving the QoL of patients undergoing chemotherapy. Weenrolled 150 cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy, which includedirinotecan, in our outpatient chemotherapy center between October 2014 andJanuary 2017. For regression analysis, variables related to the development ofirinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome were extracted from the patient'sclinical records. The degree of cholinergic syndrome was classified as follows:grade 0 = not developed; grade 1 = developed but did not require anticholinergic drugs; and grade 2 = developed and required anticholinergic drugs or stopping thechemotherapy due to cholinergic syndrome. Multivariate ordered logisticregression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors for thedevelopment of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome. Threshold measurementswere determined using a receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) curve.Significant factors identified for the development of cholinergic syndromeincluded female sex [odds ratio (OR) 2.183, 95% confidence interval (CI)1.010-4.717; P = 0.0471] and irinotecan dose (OR 1.014, 95% Cl 1.007-1.021;P = 0.0001). ROC curve analysis of the group likely to develop cholinergicsyndrome indicated that the threshold for the irinotecan dose was 175 mg or above(area under the curve = 0.69). In conclusion, female sex and irinotecan dose wereidentified as significant predictors of the development of cholinergic syndrome.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1142-3 PMID: 29705823
