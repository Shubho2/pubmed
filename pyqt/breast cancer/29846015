However, little is known of the molecular mechanismsof action. Herein we report that AKR1B10 activates lipid second messengers tostimulate cell proliferation. Our data showed that ectopic expression of AKR1B10 in breast cancer cells MCF-7 promoted lipogenesis and enhanced levels of lipidsecond messengers, including phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2),diacylglycerol (DAG), and inositol triphosphate (IP3). In contrast, silencing of AKR1B10 in breast cancer cells BT-20 and colon cancer cells HCT-8 led to decreaseof these lipid messengers. Qualitative analyses by liquid chromatography-massspectrum (LC-MS) revealed that AKR1B10 regulated the cellular levels of total DAGand majority of subspecies. This in turn modulated the phosphorylation of proteinkinase C (PKC) isoforms PKCδ (Thr505), PKCµ (Ser744/748), and PKCα/βII(Thr638/641) and activity of the PKC-mediated c-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. A pan inhibitor of PKC (Go6983) blocked ERK1/2 activation by AKR1B10. In thesecells, phospho-p90RSK, phospho-MSK, and Cyclin D1 expression was increased byAKR1B10, and pharmacological inhibition of the ERK signaling cascade with MEK1/2 inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 eradicated induction of phospho-p90RSK, phospho-MSK,and Cyclin D1. In breast cancer cells, AKR1B10 promoted the clonogenic growth andproliferation of breast cancer cells in two-dimension (2D) and three-dimension(3D) cultures and tumor growth in immunodeficient female nude mice throughactivation of the PKC/ERK pathway. These data suggest that AKR1B10 stimulatesbreast cancer cell growth and proliferation through activation of DAG-mediatedPKC/ERK signaling pathway.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/mc.22844 PMID: 29846015
