Electronic address:Lordyhw@163.com.Ribosomal S6 protein kinase 4 (RSK4) was known as a novel tumor suppressor gene, and the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) was linked to carcinogenesis. The purpose of this study is to further investigate the effect ofthe TRAF4 gene on cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis in vivo and explorewhether there is an interaction between TRAF4 and RSK4 in breast cancer.MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with lentivirus TRAF4-shRNA to specificallyblock the expression of TRAF4, or transfected with lentivirus negative-shRNA as anegative control. Four-six weeks female BALB/c nude mice were randomly assignedto three groups (n = 14): TRAF4-shRNA, negative and control, and then inoculated subcutaneously with the corresponding cells. In-vivo metastasis model wasconstructed by injecting above cells into tail vein. Tumor proliferation wasassessed in terms of the tumor growth curve, tumor size and weight. Invasion and metastasis were evaluated by the histopathologic examination in lung or/and livertissues. Measurement of TRAF4 and RSK4 expression and their correlation factors(AKT, NF-κB, TGF-β1, TNF-α, MMP2 and MMP9) were performed byimmunohistochemistry, western blot or fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. We found that the size and weight of tumors in TRAF4-shRNA group was significantly smallerthan the negative and blank group, and the number of the lung and livermetastases lesions was also fewer (P < 0.05). And TRAF4 and its correlationfactors (P-AKT, P-NF-κB, TGF-β1, TNF-α, MMP2 and MMP9) in the TRAF4-shRNA groupwere significantly decreased compared with the negative and blank group. However,the expression of RSK4 mRNA and protein in TRAF4-shRNA group were significantlyincreased. Collectively, TRAF4 knockdown significantly inhibited proliferation,invasion and metastasis in the xenograft nude mouse model, possibly involving in the interaction with RSK4 through down-regulation of AKT signaling pathway andthen inactivating NF-κB pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
