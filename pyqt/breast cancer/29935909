Electronic address:blancharde@southcoast.org.BACKGROUND: Mild-to-moderate bone pain is the most commonly reported adverseevent associated with pegfilgrastim.AIMS: To investigate the effect of bone pain education on pegfilgrastim-relatedbone pain in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy andpegfilgrastim.DESIGN: Randomized, single-blind study.SETTINGS: Forty-eight community oncology clinics throughout the United States.PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred women ≥18 years of age with newly diagnosed stage I-III breast cancer, who were planning ≥4 cycles of neoadjuvant or adjuvantchemotherapy with pegfilgrastim support starting in cycle 1.METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to view a general education DVD onchemotherapy side effects (GE-DVD) or a DVD on bone pain following chemotherapyand pegfilgrastim (BP-DVD). Patients recorded severity of bone pain on a scale of0-10, location of pain, and use of bone pain medications (i.e., analgesics,antihistamines, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for 5 days, beginningon the day of pegfilgrastim administration, in each of the first fourchemotherapy cycles.RESULTS: Patient-reported maximum bone pain was similar in the two groups (GE-DVDvs BP-DVD: cycle 1, 3.2 vs. 3.5, p = .3479; across all cycles, 4.1 vs. 4.6, p =.2196). Other measures of bone pain were also similar between the groups. Bonepain was highest in cycle 1 but decreased and then remained stable in subsequent cycles. Bone pain medication use was similar in both groups and was highest incycle 1.CONCLUSIONS: The bone pain-specific education evaluated here did not improveperceptions of bone pain reported in this patient population.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Pain Management Nursing.
