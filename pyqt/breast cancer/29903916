The ETS variant 6(ETV6)-neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (NTRK3) (EN) chimeric tyrosinekinase is expressed in mesenchymal, epithelial, and hematopoietic cancers andrequires the IGF1R axis for transformation. However, current models ofIGF1R-mediated EN activation are lacking mechanistic detail. We demonstrate here that IGF-mediated IGF1R stimulation enhances EN tyrosine phosphorylation and thatblocking IGF1R activity or decreasing protein levels of the adaptor proteininsulin receptor substrate 1/2 (IRS1/2) results in rapid EN degradation. This wasobserved both in vitro and in vivo in fibroblast and breast epithelial cell line models and in MO91, an EN expressing human leukemia cell line. Stable isotopelabeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based MS analysis identifiedthe E3 ligase RING-finger protein 123 (Rnf123, more commonly known as KPC1) as anEN interactor upon IGF1R/insulin receptor (INSR) inhibitor treatment. KPC1/Rnf123ubiquitylated EN in vitro, and its overexpression decreased EN protein levels. Incontrast, KPC1/Rnf123 knockdown rendered EN resistant to IGF1R inhibitor-mediateddegradation. These results support a critical function for IGF1R in protecting ENfrom KPC1/Rnf123-mediated proteasomal degradation. Attempts to therapeuticallytarget oncogenic chimeric tyrosine kinases have traditionally focused on blockingkinase activity to restrict downstream activation of essential signalingpathways. In this study, we demonstrate that IGF1R inhibition results in rapidubiquitylation and degradation of the EN oncoprotein through aproteasome-dependent mechanism that is reversible, highlighting a potentialstrategy for targeting chimeric tyrosine kinases in cancer.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and MolecularBiology, Inc.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.000321 PMID: 29903916
