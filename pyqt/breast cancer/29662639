The aim of this meta-analysis was toreview and quantitatively assess the relationship between single nucleotidepolymorphisms in base-excision repair genes and breast cancer risk. The resultssuggested that a mutation of T to G in rs1760944 may lead to a higher risk ofdeveloping breast cancer in the Mongoloid population, and G to A of rs25487significantly reduced the risk of breast cancer in Mongoloid and Caucasoidpopulations. In contrast to the CC and CG genotypes, the GG genotype of rs1052133located on theOGG1 gene appeared to be a protective factor against developingbreast cancer in both Mongoloid and Caucasoid populations. There was no evidence to suggest that rs25489, rs1799782, rs1130409, rs1805414 and rs1136410 wereassociated with breast cancer risk. In conclusion, this study provides evidenceto support the theory that DNA repair genes are associated with breast cancerrisk, providing information to further understand breast cancer etiology. and Thepotential biological pathways linking DNA repair, ethnic background, environment and breast cancer require further investigation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23804 PMCID: PMC5882330PMID: 29662639
