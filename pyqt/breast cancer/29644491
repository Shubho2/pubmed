The US Food and DrugAdministration has approved three PARPi (olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib) sofar to treat certain ovarian cancers, including those with gBRCAm and olaparibfor treatment of gBRCAm breast cancers. Several PARPi are now under clinicaldevelopment for breast cancer in the various treatment settings. Recently, twophase III trials of olaparib (OlympiaD) and talazoparib (EMBRACA) demonstrated3-month progression-free survival improvement with PARPi compared to physician's choice single agent chemotherapy in metastatic gBRCAm breast cancer. To date,PARPi seems less efficacious in metastatic breast cancer patients than those withBRCA mutated platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, perhaps reflecting the biologic heterogeneity and low somatic BRCA mutation rate in breast cancer. Theuse of PARPi is gradually evolving, including combination strategies withchemotherapy, targeted agents, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy in women with andwithout gBRCAm. The role of predictive biomarkers, including molecular signaturesand homologous recombination repair deficiency scores based on loss ofheterozygosity and other structural genomic aberrations, will be crucial toidentify a subgroup of patients who may have benefit from PARPi. An improvedunderstanding of the mechanisms underlying PARPi clinical resistance will also beimportant to enable the development of new approaches to increase efficacy. This is a field rich in opportunity, and the coming years should see a betterunderstanding of which breast cancer patients we should treat with PARPi andwhere these agents should come in over the course of treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s11864-018-0540-2 PMID: 29644491
