We unexpectedly found elevatedketamine levels in both CSF and plasma of dKO versus WT rats. Therefore, theeffect of these transporters was investigated on the 1) oral and intraperitoneal serum pharmacokinetics (PK) of ketamine, using a liquid chromatography method(high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection), and 2) theanesthetic effect of ketamine using a duration of loss-of-righting reflex (dLORR)test in WT, Bcrp knockout (KO), Pgp KO, and Pgp/Bcrp dKO mice. The PK datademonstrated a significantly increased oral bioavailability and serum exposure ofketamine in dKO > Pgp KO > Bcrp KO mice compared with WT mice. Intraperitonealketamine-induced dLORR was significantly longer in dKO > Pgp KO > Bcrp KO > WTmice compared with WT mice. Inhibition of Bcrp and Pgp in WT mice using the dual Pgp/Bcrp inhibitor elacridar increased the ketamine-induced dLORR compared withvehicle-treated mice. The ketamine intracellular concentration was significantly decreased in Madin-Darby canine kidney II BCRP/PGP cells compared with theparental cells. In total, these results demonstrate that ketamine appears to be adual Pgp/Bcrp substrate whose PK and pharmacodynamics are affected by Pgp andBcrp-mediated efflux.Copyright Â© 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/dmd.117.078360 PMCID: PMC5992966 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29674491
