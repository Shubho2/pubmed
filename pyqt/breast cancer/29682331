Testing has been performed according tointernational guidelines, focusing on family history (FH) of breast and/orovarian cancer. An alternative is testing all patients with BC employingsequencing of the BRCA genes and Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA).Patients and methods: A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, employing datafrom Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål (OUH-U) and a decision tree, was done. Thesocietal and the healthcare perspectives were focused and a lifetime perspective employed. The comparators were the traditional FH approach used as standard ofcare at OUH-U in 2013 and the intervention (testing all patients with BC)performed in 2014 and 2015 at the same hospital. During the latter period, 535patients with BC were offered BRCA testing with sequencing and MLPA. National2014 data on mortality rates and costs were implemented, a 3% discount rate used and the costing year was 2015. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio wascalculated in euros (€) per life-year gained (LYG).Results: The net healthcare cost (healthcare perspective) was €40 503/LYG.Including all resource use (societal perspective), the cost was €5669/LYG. Theunivariate sensitivity analysis documented the unit cost of the BRCA test and thenumber of LYGs the prominent parameters affecting the result.Diagnostic BRCAtesting of all patients with BC was superior to the FH approach andcost-effective within the frequently used thresholds (healthcare perspective) in Norway (€60 000-€80 000/LYG).DOI: 10.1136/esmoopen-2018-000328 PMCID: PMC5905828PMID: 29682331
