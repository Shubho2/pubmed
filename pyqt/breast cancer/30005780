Electronic address: meeghanl@buffalo.edu.Sarcoma of the breast is extremely rare and differs from epithelial breastcarcinomas in staging and treatment. Diagnostic workup includes breast imagingand core biopsy as in breast epithelial carcinoma. Surgical management is oftenwide local excision in the form of breast conservation if possible for primarybreast sarcoma or total mastectomy. Radiation-associated breast angiosarcomasoften require total mastectomy with radical excision of skin. Breast sarcomashave a hematogenous spread so lymph node evaluation is not a part of treatment orstaging. Local recurrence rates are high; prognosis remains poor despite on-goingadvances in the treatment of epithelial breast carcinoma.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
