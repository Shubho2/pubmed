The majorityof breast cancer metastases to endometrium are lobular type, and there have been only 5 reported cases of ductal type since 1984. Here, we describe a new case of invasive ductal carcinoma with metastases to endometrium and isolatedpresentation of abnormal uterine bleeding, in addition to reviewing the existing literature on other similar cases. CASE REPORT The patient was a 51-year-oldPersian woman with no remarkable past medical or family history of cancer, whopresented with a 6-month complaint of menorrhagia to our gynecology clinic.Diagnostic studies including trans-vaginal ultrasonography, pathologicalexamination of endometrial curettage specimen, immunohistochemistry findings, andX-plane and magnetic resonance mammography, and breast core-needle biopsyrevealed invasive ductal breast carcinoma as the origin of the endometrialmetastasis. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal uterine bleeding in a premenopausal patientshould alert clinicians to the possibility of secondary as well as primaryneoplasms. It is necessary to differentiate a metastatic tumor from a primaryone, since the treatment and prognosis are completely different.DOI: 10.12659/AJCR.907638 PMCID: PMC5944400PMID: 29700276
