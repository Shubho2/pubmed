Tumor tissue (if available) was centrally evaluated forPIK3CA mutations. Adverse events (AE) were recorded using NCI-CTCAE v4.0. Tumorresponse was investigator-determined using RECIST v1.1.Results: Median treatment duration was 4.6 (range: 0.9-40.5) months. All patients experienced ≥1 AE, 30(50.0%) had grade ≥3 AEs, and 19 (31.7%) experienced 35 serious AEs. Forty-seven of 60 patients had evaluable tissue for central PIK3CA mutation testing [20 hadmutations, 27 had no mutation detected (MND)]. In patients with baselinemeasurable disease, clinical activity was observed in tumors with PIK3CAmutations [best confirmed response rate: 38.5% (5/13; 95% CI, 13.9-68.4);clinical benefit rate (CBR): 38.5% (5/13; 95% CI, 13.9-68.4)], PIK3CA-MND [bestconfirmed response rate: 14.3% (3/21; 95% CI, 3.0-36.3); CBR: 23.8% (5/21; 95%CI, 8.2-47.2)], and unknown PIK3CA mutation status [best confirmed response rate:20.0% (2/10; 95% CI, 2.5-55.6); CBR: 30.0% (3/10; 95% CI, 6.7-65.2)].Conclusions:Taselisib plus fulvestrant had clinical activity irrespective of PIK3CA mutation status, with numerically higher objective response rate and CBR in patients with PIK3CA-mutated (vs. -MND) locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative,HR-positive breast cancer. No new safety signals were reported. A confirmatoryphase III trial is ongoing.
