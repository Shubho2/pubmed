Previously, we reported the first study of the anti-angiogenic andanti-tumour activities of 4-vinylphenol. To further examine the therapeutic role of 4-vinylphenol, the inhibitory effects of 4-vinylphenol on cancer stemness,drug resistance and metastasis in breast cancer were investigated in the present study.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We enriched parental MDA-MB-231 cells with CSCs inserum-free medium to give spheroids. The effects of 4-vinylphenol on cancerstemness, metastasis and drug resistance in CSC-enriched MDA-MB-231 cells werestudied in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: CSC-enriched MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrated higher tumorigenic andmetastatic potential. 4-Vinylphenol reduced spheroid formation and ALDH1expression in CSC-enriched cultures, revealing its inhibitory effects on thetraits of CSCs. 4-Vinylphenol suppressed colony formation and cell proliferation.4VP also inhibited in vitro invasion and in vivo metastasis in zebrafish model.Our results showed that it reduced vimentin expression, suppressed cellmigration, affected the expression and/or activity of MMPs, TIMPs and uPA. Inaddition, the expressions of caspases 3 and 9 were increased upon its treatment, and surprisingly, prolonged treatment did not confer cancer cells with drugresistance to 4-vinylphenol. 4-Vinylphenol probably exhibited its anti-canceractivities via beta-catenin, EGFR and AKT signaling pathways.CONCLUSION: 4-Vinylphenol was shown to inhibit metastasis and cancer stemness in CSC-enriched breast cancer cells. Since conventional therapies not targeting CSCspossibly lead to failure to eliminate cancer, 4-vinylphenol is a highly potentialtherapeutic agent for breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3601-0 PMID: 29777274
