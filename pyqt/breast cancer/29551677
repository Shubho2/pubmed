And phosphorylatedAkt (p-Akt) is certified to be involved in many types of cancers such as breastinvasive ductal carcinoma (BIDC). However, the relationship between IRS-1 andAkt, as well as the role of expression of IRS-1 in BIDC, has never been reported.The purpose of this research is to investigate the association between expressionof IRS-1 and p-Akt proteins and clinicopathological features of BIDC byimmunohistochemistry, as well as the survival status. The results showed that thepercentage of either elevated expression of IRS-1 or positive p-Akt expression inBIDC is significantly higher than that in control breast tissue from non-cancerpatients (P<.001, P=.001, respectively). Overexpression of IRS-1 was evidentlyassociated with positive expression of p-Akt (r=.337, P<.001). Also, positivepercentage of p-Akt expression was statistically different among differentmolecular subtypes of BIDC (highest in luminal B BIDC, P=.009). Furthermore,significantly worse overall survival was in BIDC patients with high expression ofIRS-1 and p-Akt than patients with low expression (P=.006, P=.004, respectively).The multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that highexpression of IRS-1 and positive expression of p-Akt protein were independentpoor prognostic factors for patients with BIDC (P=.022, P=.046, respectively). Inconclusion, we report for the first time that overexpression of IRS-1 proteinassociates with expression of p-Akt, and overexpression of IRS-1 and positiveexpression of p-Akt might be independent biomarkers for poor prognosis in BIDC.Copyright Â© 2018.
