SK-BR-3 is known to be highly rearranged, although much of the variation is in complex and repetitiveregions that may be underreported. Addressing this, we sequenced SK-BR-3 usinglong-read single molecule sequencing from Pacific Biosciences and develop one of the most detailed maps of structural variations (SVs) in a cancer genomeavailable, with nearly 20,000 variants present, most of which were missed byshort-read sequencing. Surrounding the important ERBB2 oncogene (also known asHER2), we discover a complex sequence of nested duplications and translocations, suggesting a punctuated progression. Full-length transcriptome sequencing furtherrevealed several novel gene fusions within the nested genomic variants. Combininglong-read genome and transcriptome sequencing enables an in-depth analysis of howSVs disrupt the genome and sheds new light on the complex mechanisms involved in cancer genome evolution.Â© 2018 Nattestad et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.DOI: 10.1101/gr.231100.117 PMID: 29954844
