China.A new phloroglucinol derivative, named eucalyptin B (1), along with five related known compounds (2 - 6), was isolated from the fruits of Eucalyptus globulus.Their structures were elucidated by means of 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy, withthe absolute configuration of 1 determined by electronic circular dichroism (ECD)calculations. All isolated compounds (1 - 6) were evaluated for their cytotoxicactivities against lung (A549), breast (4T1), and skin (B16F10) cancer celllines. On the basis of cell viability assay, the cytotoxic activity of eucalyptinB (1) was further confirmed by apoptosis assay. Additionally, after treatmentwith eucalyptin B (1), the apoptosis factor proteins (Bcl2 and Bax) and caspase-3levels in A549 cells were also determined by Western-blot analysis. By cytotoxic assay, eucalyptin B (1) exhibited potent cytotoxicity against A549 cells with an IC50 value of 1.51 μm and induced concentration dependent apoptosis of up to 49%.Additionally, eucalyptin B (1) inhibited 5-fold and increased 10-folds in thelevel of Bcl2 and Bax, respectively. Furthermore, the 11-fold increase in thelevel of caspase-3 confirmed eucalyptin B (1) activated caspase dependentapoptosis pathway. In conclusion, the isolated compound eucalyptin B (1) haspromising cytotoxic activity in tumor cells, especially in A549.© 2018 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.DOI: 10.1002/cbdv.201800052 PMID: 29692000  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
