China.As a multifunctional protein involved in numerous biological processes, Set isexpressed in several embryonic and adult organs. Furthermore, Set isoverexpressed in numerous types of human cancers, including acute myeloidleukemia, breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. The expression of Set in germcells is involved in gonad development, and the overexpression of Set has beenobserved in polycystic ovaries. In order to elucidate the physiological andpathological roles of Set, a Set transgenic mouse model was developed, in whichthe global overexpression of Set in adult tissues could be induced via theCre/loxP system with the precise deletion of the Stop fragment indouble-transgenic hybrids. This result was then confirmed by genotypical andprotein analysis using polymerase chain reaction and bioluminescence imaging. In conclusion, the conditional Set transgenic mice carrying a reporter system weresuccessfully generated. The transgenic mice open a new window for the furtherinvestigation of the function of Set using tissue-specific Cre mice and inducibleCre systems.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2017.5612 PMCID: PMC5776649PMID: 29434793
