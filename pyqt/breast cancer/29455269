Targeted therapy is an important approach for improving the therapeutic effects of AGC treatment. This study evaluates the efficacy andsafety of targeted agents for AGC patients.METHODS: PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AGC treatments published prior to July2017. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and severe adverse effects (AEs) were evaluated to determine theefficacy and safety of targeted agents. A network meta-analysis with afrequentist framework was performed to assess the effects of various targetedagents for AGC treatment.RESULTS: Our analysis included 16 articles involving 5371 patients and 11 typesof agents. The network meta-analysis showed that apatinib (97.5%) was most likelyto improve PFS, followed by regorafenib (86.3%) and rilotumumab (65.4%). Apatinibwas similarly best for OS outcome, (95.5%) followed by rilotumumab (74.7%) andregorafenib (70%). Apatinib (89.6%) also had the best improvement on ORR,followed by rilotumumab (75.4%) and everolimus (68.4%). Bevacizumab (85.5%) waslikely to get the lowest severe AEs, followed by sunitinib (63%).CONCLUSIONS: Apatinib, regorafenib, and rilotumumab improved patient PFS and OS. When combined with chemotherapy, ramucirumab and rilotumumab had high efficacybut low tolerability, and bevacizumab had moderate efficacy and tolerability for PFS. Without chemotherapy, ramucirumab and regorafenib had relatively hightherapeutic efficacy tolerability for PFS.DOI: 10.1007/s10120-018-0813-2 PMID: 29455269
