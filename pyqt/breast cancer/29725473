China.Diallyl disulfide (DADS), a volatile component of garlic oil, has variousbiological properties, including antioxidant, antiangiogenic and anticancereffects. The present study aimed to explore novel targets of DADS that may slowor stop the progression of breast cancer. First, xenograft tumor models werecreated by subcutaneously injecting MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells intonude mice. Subsequently, western blot analysis was performed to investigate theexpression of tristetraprolin (TTP), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the xenograft tumors, and cellcultures. Tablet cloning, Transwell and wound healing assays revealed that DADStreatment significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration ofbreast cancer cells. In addition, DADS treatment led to significantdownregulation of uPA and MMP-9 protein expression, but significantly upregulatedTTP expression in vivo and in vitro. Knocking down TTP expression using smallinterfering RNA reversed the aforementioned effects of DADS, which suggests TTPis a key target of DADS in inhibiting the progression of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8299 PMCID: PMC5920483PMID: 29725473
