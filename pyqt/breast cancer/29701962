Using an integrated design, synthesis,and screening platform, we were able to rapidly develop potent and selectiveinhibitors of hepsin. In progressing from the initial hit 7 to compound 53, theIC50 value against hepsin was improved from ∼1 μM to 22 nM, and the selectivityover urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) was increased from 30-fold to>6000-fold. Subsequent in vitro ADMET profiling and cellular studies confirmedthat the leading compounds are useful tools for interrogating the role of hepsin in breast tumorigenesis.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01698 PMID: 29701962
