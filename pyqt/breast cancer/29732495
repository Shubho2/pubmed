In this work, we exploredthe potential of the volatile composition of saliva samples as biosignatures for breast cancer (BC) non-invasive diagnosis. To achieve this, 106 saliva samples ofBC patients and controls in two distinct geographic regions in Portugal and Indiawere extracted and analysed using optimised headspace solid-phase microextractiongas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS, 2 mL acidified salivacontaining 10% NaCl, stirred (800 rpm) for 45 min at 38 °C and using the CAR/PDMSSPME fibre) followed by multivariate statistical analysis (MVSA). Over 120volatiles from distinct chemical classes, with significant variations among thegroups, were identified. MVSA retrieved a limited number of volatiles, viz.3-methyl-pentanoic acid, 4-methyl-pentanoic acid, phenol and p-tert-butyl-phenol (Portuguese samples) and acetic, propanoic, benzoic acids, 1,2-decanediol,2-decanone, and decanal (Indian samples), statistically relevant for thediscrimination of BC patients in the populations analysed. This work defines anexperimental layout, HS-SPME/GC-MS followed by MVSA, suitable to characterisevolatile fingerprints for saliva as putative biosignatures for BC non-invasivediagnosis. Here, it was applied to BC samples from geographically distantpopulations and good disease separation was obtained. Further studies usinglarger cohorts are therefore very pertinent to challenge and strengthen thisproof-of-concept study. Graphical abstract ᅟ.DOI: 10.1007/s00216-018-1103-x PMID: 29732495
