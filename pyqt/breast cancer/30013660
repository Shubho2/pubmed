China.The incidence of breast cancer is increasing throughout the world. Althoughsignificant progress has been made in diagnostic techniques and targetedtherapies, the prognosis of breast cancer remains poor. Regulator ofdifferentiation 1 (ROD1) may inhibit the development of several types of cancer. However, the role of ROD1 in breast cancer cells remains unknown. In the present study, western blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerasechain reaction revealed that expression of ROD1 was significantly reduced inbreast cancer cells. Overexpression of ROD1 reduced the proliferation rate,demonstrated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Additionally, the overexpression of ROD1 decreased the invasiveness of breast cancer cells, indicating that ROD1may serve as a tumor suppressor. Additionally, the data suggested that ROD1significantly suppressed the activity of Wnt luciferase reporter (TOP Flash) inMDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that ROD1 may interact withβ-catenin by using co-immunoprecipitation, resulting in suppression of β-catenin migration into the nucleus. Notably, ROD1 demonstrated its anticancer effect bydecreasing β-catenin (Y333) phosphorylation in a nude mouse xenograft model.Overexpression of ROD1 may downregulate Ki67 protein levels, as determined byimmunohistochemistry. These results indicated that ROD1 may be used as atherapeutic target in patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8917 PMCID: PMC6036599PMID: 30013660
