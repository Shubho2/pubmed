Chengdu 610041, PR China.The combination of chemotherapy with photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attractedbroad attention as it can overcome limitations of conventional chemo-treatment byusing different modes of action. However, the efficacy of PDT to treat solidtumors is severely affected by hypoxia in tumors. Methods: In this study, wedeveloped oxygen-generating theranostic nanoparticles (CDM NPs) by hierarchicallyassembling doxorubicin (DOX), chlorin e6 (Ce6) and colloidal manganese dioxide(MnO2) with poly (ε-caprolactone-co-lactide)-b-poly (ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone-co-lactide) for treating breast cancer. The in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy and imaging performance were investigated. Results: Thetheranostic nanoparticles showed high stability and biocompatibility both invitro and in vivo. MnO2 within the nanoparticles could trigger decomposition ofexcessive endogenous H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment to generate oxygenin-situ to relieve tumor hypoxia. With enhanced oxygen generation, the PDT effectwas significantly improved under laser-irradiation. More importantly, this effecttogether with that of DOX was able to dramatically promote the combinedchemotherapy-PDT efficacy of CDM NPs in an MCF-7 tumor-bearing mouse model.Furthermore, the real-time tumor accumulation of the nanocomposites could bemonitored by fluorescence imaging, photoacoustic (PA) imaging and magneticresonance imaging (MRI). Conclusion: The designed CDM NPs are expected to providean alternative way of improving antitumor efficacy by combined chemo-PDT further enhanced by oxygen generation, and would have broad applications in cancertheranostics.DOI: 10.7150/thno.22989 PMCID: PMC5858167PMID: 29556341
