Epub2018 Mar 22.Service evaluation project - Are local recommendations for onward referral to aspecialist menopause clinic required to translate guidelines into practice?Neill AMC(1).Author information: (1)iCASH Clinic, Cambridge, UK.Objective Referral audit - are local recommendations required to translateguideline to practice? Study design In total, 50 consecutive, anonymised referralletters reviewed during the initial consultation in a specialist menopauseclinic; the reasons for referral along with the patient's age and the source ofreferral were analysed. Results Several common reasons for referral wereidentified. Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido and dyspareunia,resulted in 11 (22%) referrals. Ten (20%) women were troubled by persistentsymptoms or side effects from HRT; 9 (18%) women were referred before hormonereplacement therapy was discussed or commenced; 7 (14%) women seeking advice for their menopausal symptoms had a family or personal history of cancer; 5(10%) weremigraineurs; 2(4%) women had premature ovarian insufficiency; 2(4%) were deniedhormone replacement therapy because of concern about venous thromboembolism risk;and 4 (8%) had miscellaneous medical disorders. Over 25% of referrals were older than 60. Conclusion Menopausal symptoms are predominately dealt with in primarycare where advice and support is needed. National Institute for Health Care andExcellence published guidance regarding onward referral to a specialist menopauseclinic, which is vague and referral patterns are haphazard. Our audit highlightedareas of clinical uncertainty and formed the basis for providing localpre-referral information and advice. Some of the information provided is quitedetailed and aimed at healthcare professionals with a special interest inmenopause. Further training is now required to improve the quality of referrals. The diversity and complexity of some referrals illustrates the need both for amenopause specialist and clear pathways for further advice or referral withineach region.DOI: 10.1177/2053369118762241 PMID: 29562803
