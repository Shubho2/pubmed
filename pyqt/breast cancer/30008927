China.Breast cancer (BC) is characterized by high incidences of bone metastases.Current treatment strategies for BC bone metastases primarily focused on breakingthe 'vicious osteolytic cycle'. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potentphospholipid mediator, which has previously reported biological activities in BC progression and osteoclast differentiation by activating its receptor PAFreceptor (PTAFR). However, the role of PAF in the mediation of BC bone metastasesremains elusive. In the present study, it was revealed that the upregulation ofPTAFR was associated with an increased incidence of bone metastases. It was also revealed that PAF significantly enhanced the processes of BC cell migration andBC mediated osteoclastogenesis. These results suggest that PAF serves a promotionrole in BC bone metastases. It was further demonstrated that the natural PAFantagonist Kadsurenone may effectively attenuate each process by partiallyblocking the PAF/PTAFR signaling pathway. Therefore, targeting PAF/PTAFR byKadsurenone may be a promising treatment strategy for BC bone metastases.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8935 PMCID: PMC6036417PMID: 30008927
