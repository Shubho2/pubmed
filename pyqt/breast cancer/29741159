In this study, we proposecarbon dot decorated single digit (4-5 nm diameter) primary particles ofdetonation nanodiamond as promising fluorescent probes. Due to their intrinsicfluorescence originating from tiny (1-2 atomic layer thickness) carbonaceousstructures on their surfaces, they exhibit brightness suitable for in vitroimaging. Moreover, this material offers a unique, cost effective alternative tosub-10 nm nanodiamonds containing fluorescent nitrogen-vacancy color centers,which have not yet been produced at large scale. In this paper, carbon dotdecorated nanodiamonds are characterized by several analytical techniques. Inaddition, the efficient cellular uptake and fluorescence of these particles areobserved in vitro on MDA-MD-231 breast cancer cells by means of confocal imaging.Finally, the in vivo biocompatibility of carbon dot decorated nanodiamonds isdemonstrated in zebrafish during the development. Our results indicate thepotential of single-digit detonation nanodiamonds as biocompatible fluorescentprobes. This unique material will find application in correlative light andelectron microscopy, where small sized NDs can be attached to antibodies to actas a suitable dual marker for intracellular correlative microscopy ofbiomolecules.DOI: 10.1088/2050-6120/aac0c8 PMID: 29741159
