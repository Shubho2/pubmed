Numerous factors contribute to this phenomenon including therecently-reported ESR1 gene mutations such as Y537S, which amplifies co-activatorinteractions with ERα and promotes constitutive activation of ERα function.Herein, we propose that direct targeting of the activation function-2 (AF2) site on ERα represents a promising alternative therapeutic strategy to overcomemutation-driven resistance in breast cancer. A systematic computer-guided drugdiscovery approach was employed to develop a potent ERα inhibitor that wasextensively evaluated by a series of experiments to confirm its AF2-specificactivity. We demonstrate that the developed small-molecule inhibitor effectively prevents ERα-coactivator interactions and exhibits a strong anti-proliferativeeffect against tamoxifen-resistant cells, as well as downregulates ERα-dependent genes and effectively diminishes the receptor binding to chromatin. Notably, the identified lead compound successfully inhibits known constitutively-active,resistance-associated mutant forms of ERα observed in clinical settings. Overall,this study reports the development of a novel class of ERα AF2 inhibitors, which have the potential to effectively inhibit ERα activity by a unique mechanism and to circumvent the issue of mutation-driven resistance in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19020579 PMCID: PMC5855801PMID: 29462880
