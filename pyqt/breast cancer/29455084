Electronic address: a.mangia@oncologico.bari.it.Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) is a scaffold protein, with twotandem PDZ domains and a carboxyl-terminal ezrin-binding (EB) region. Thisparticular sticky structure is responsible for its interaction with differentmolecules to form multi-complexes that have a pivotal role in a lot of diseases. In particular, its involvement during carcinogenesis and cancer progression hasbeen deeply analyzed in different tumors. The role of NHERF1 is not unique incancer; its activity is connected to its subcellular localization. The literaturedata suggest that NHERF1 could be a new prognostic/predictive biomarker frombreast cancer to hematological cancers. Furthermore, the high potential of thismolecule as therapeutical target in different carcinomas is a new challenge forprecision medicine. These evidences are part of a future view to improvingpatient clinical management, which should allow different tumor phenotypes to be treated with tailored therapies. This article reviews the biology of NHERF1, its engagement in different signal pathways and its involvement in different cancers,with a specific focus on breast cancer. It also considers NHERF1 potential roleduring inflammation related to most human cancers, designating new perspectivesin the study of this "Janus-like" protein.Copyright Â© 2018.
