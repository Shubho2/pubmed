The usefulness isunclear in cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed at biopsy beforesurgery, which sometimes is upgraded to IBC after definitive surgery. The aim of this study is to find out the usefulness of PET/CT on DCIS as a preoperativeevaluation tool.Methods: We investigated 102 patients preoperatively diagnosed with DCIS whosubsequently underwent definitive surgery between 2010 and 2015. The uptake of18F-fluorodeoxyglucose was graded by visual and semiquantitative methods. Weanalyzed the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of each patient withclinicopathologic variables. We determined optimal cutoff values for SUVmax byreceiver operating characteristic curve analysis.Results: Fifteen cases out of 102 cases (14.7%) were upgraded to IBC aftersurgery. The SUVmax was higher in patients upgraded to IBC (mean: 2.56 vs. 1.36) (P = 0.007). The SUVmax was significantly higher in patients who had symptoms,palpable masses, lesions over 2 cm in size and BI-RAD category 5. Both visual andsemiquantitative analysis were significant predictors of IBC underestimation.SUVmax of 2.65 was the theoretical cutoff value in ROC curve analysis inpredicting the underestimation of IBC. The underestimation rate was significantlyhigher in patients with SUVmax >2.65 (P < 0.001), over the moderate enhanceduptake on visual analysis (P < 0.001).Conclusion: PET/CT can be used as a complementary evaluation tool to predict the underestimation of DCIS combined with the lesion size, palpable mass, symptomaticlesion, and BI-RAD category.DOI: 10.4174/astr.2018.94.2.63 PMCID: PMC5801329PMID: 29441334
