In our present study, we screened our internalcompound library and discovered a novel HDACi, WW437, with potent anti-breastcancer ability in vitro and in vivo. WW437 significantly inhibited phosphorylatedEphA2 and EphA2 expression. Further study demonstrated WW437 blocked HDACs-EphA2 signaling axis in breast cancer. In parallel, we found that EphA2 expressionpositively correlates with breast cancer progression; and combined use of WW437and an EphA2 inhibitor (ALW-II-41-27) exerted more remarkable effect on breastcancer growth than either drug alone. Our findings suggested inhibition ofHDACs-EphA2 signaling axis with WW437 alone or in combination with other agentsmay be a promising therapeutic strategy for advanced breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
