Ginsenoside Rh4 has beenreported to be present in processed ginseng. However, few studies have focused onits anti-tumor activity. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects ofginsenoside Rh4 on MCF-7 breast cancer cells and the pathways that promoteapoptosis in vitro. To study the effect of ginsenoside Rh4 in vivo, xenograftmodels were randomly divided into 3 groups (the control group, 10 mg/kg/d Rh4,20 mg/kg/d Rh4, n = 10 per group), the ginsenoside Rh4 injection method was i.p. The results showed that ginsenoside Rh4 effectively inhibited proliferation,arrested the cell cycle in S phase and induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by flowcytometry. Morphological changes caused by ginsenoside Rh4-induced apoptosis werealso observed by Hoechst 33342 staining. Western-blot analyses indicated that theapoptosis-inducing effects of ginsenoside Rh4 were associated with the externalpathway by decreasing Bcl-2, increasing Bax, and activating caspase-8, -3 andPARP. Moreover, ginsenoside Rh4 significantly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 tumorcells in vivo. These results suggested that ginsenoside Rh4 could be apotentially effective anti-tumor drug for breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
