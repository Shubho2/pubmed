Karyopherin alpha 7 (KPNA7), the newest member of the karyopherin alpha nuclear importer family, is expressed at a high level duringembryogenesis, reduced to very low or absent levels in most adult tissues butre-expressed in cancer cells.METHODS: We used siRNA-based knock-down of KPNA7 in cancer cell lines, followedby functional assays (proliferation and cell cycle) and immunofluorescentstainings to determine the role of KPNA7 in regulation of cancer cell growth,proper mitosis and nuclear morphology.RESULTS: In the present study, we show that the silencing of KPNA7 results in adramatic reduction in pancreatic and breast cancer cell growth, irrespective ofthe endogenous KPNA7 expression level. This growth inhibition is accompanied by adecrease in the fraction of S-phase cells as well as aberrant number ofcentrosomes and severe distortion of the mitotic spindles. In addition, KPNA7depletion leads to reorganization of lamin A/C and B1, the main nuclear laminaproteins, and drastic alterations in nuclear morphology with lobulated andelongated nuclei.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data provide new important evidence on thecontribution of KPNA7 to the regulation of cancer cell growth and the maintenanceof nuclear envelope environment, and thus deepens our understanding on the impactof nuclear transfer proteins in cancer pathogenesis.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4261-5 PMCID: PMC5870926PMID: 29580221
