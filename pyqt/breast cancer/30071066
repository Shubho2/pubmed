DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are responsible for regulating DNA methylation in normal cells. However, many aberrant versionsof DNMTs have been identified to date and their role in cancer continues to beelucidated. It has been previously shown that an aberrant version of a de novomethylase, DNMT3B7, is expressed in many cancer cell lines and has a functionalrole in the progression of breast cancer, neuroblastoma, and lymphoma. It isclear that DNMT3B7 is important to tumor development in vitro and in vivo, but itis unknown if expression of the transcript in all of these cell lines translates to relevant clinical results. In this study, a bioinformatics approach wasutilized to test the hypothesis that DNMT3B7 expression corresponds to tumorprogression in patient samples across cancer types. Gene expression and clinical data were obtained from the Genomic Data Commons for the 33 cancer typesavailable and analyzed for DNMT3B7 expression with relation to tissue type inmatched and unmatched samples, staging of tumors, and patient survival. Here wepresent the results of this analysis indicating a role for DNMT3B7 in tumorprogression of many additional cancer types. Based on these data, future in vitroand in vivo studies can be prioritized to examine DNMT3B7 in cancer and,hopefully, develop novel therapeutics to target this aberrant transcript acrossmultiple tumor types.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201522 PMID: 30071066
