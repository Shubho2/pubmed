Positron emission tomography/computed tomography(PET/CT) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and the genomic grade index (GGI),each separately, showed good potential to predict pCR. Our study was designed to evaluate the predictive value for the therapeutic response of a combination ofparameters based on FDG-PET, histoclinical features and molecular markers ofproliferation.METHODS: Molecular parameters were measured on pre-treatment biopsy. Tumormetabolic activity was measured using two PET/CT scans, one before and one after 2 cycles of NAC. The pCR was determined on specimen after NAC. Event-freesurvival (EFS) was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method.RESULTS: Of 55 TNBC patients, 19 (35%) reached pCR after NAC. Tumor grade andKi67 were not associated with pCR whereas GGI (P = 0.04) and its component KPNA2 (P = 0.04) showed a predictive value. The change of FDG uptake between PET1 andPET2 (ΔSUVmax) was highly associated with pCR (P = 0.0001) but the absolute valueof baseline SUVmax was not (P = 0.11). However, the AUC of pCR predictionincreased from 0.63 to 0.76 when baseline SUVmax was combined with the GGI(P = 0.016). The only two parameters associated with EFS were ΔSUVmax (P = 0.048)and pathological response (P = 0.014).CONCLUSIONS: The early tumor metabolic change during NAC is a powerful parameter to predict pCR and outcome in TNBC patients. The GGI, determined on pretreatment biopsy, is also predictive of pCR and the combination GGI and baseline SUVmaximproves the prediction.DOI: 10.1007/s00259-018-3998-z PMID: 29616304
