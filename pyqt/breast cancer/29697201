MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules thatpost-transcriptionally regulate gene expression and play crucial roles in diversebiological processes, such as development, differentiation, apoptosis, andproliferation. We investigated the roles of miRNAs in the development of drugresistance in human breast cancer cells.METHODS: MiRNA expression was detected in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7and MDA-MB-468 via real time PCR;3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide, cell viability,colony formation, and luciferase reporter gene assays; Western blot; andimmunohistochemistry.RESULTS: MiR-1307 was downregulated while MDM4 was upregulated in MCF-7/cisplatin(CDDP) and MDA-MB-468/CDDP cells compared with parental MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468cells. in vitro drug sensitivity assay demonstrated that overexpression ofmiR-1307 sensitized MCF-7/CDDP cells to CDDP. Luciferase activity assay with areporter containing sequences from the 3' untranslated region of Mdm4 inMCF-7/CDDP cells suggested that Mdm4 was the direct target gene of miR-1307.Ectopic miR-1307 expression reduced the MDM4 protein level and sensitizedMCF-7/CDDP cells to CDDP-induced apoptosis.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest, for the first time, that miR-1307 could play a role in the development of CDDP resistance in breast cancer, at least in part by modulating apoptosis by targeting Mdm4.Â© 2018 The Authors.
