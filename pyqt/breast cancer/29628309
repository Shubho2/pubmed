Here, we report that recruitment of theJmjC-domain-containing protein 6 (JMJD6) to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-boundactive enhancers is required for RNA polymerase II recruitment and enhancer RNAproduction on enhancers, resulting in transcriptional pause release of cognateestrogen target genes. JMJD6 is found to interact with MED12 in the mediatorcomplex to regulate its recruitment. Unexpectedly, JMJD6 is necessary for MED12to interact with CARM1, which methylates MED12 at multiple arginine sites andregulates its chromatin binding. Consistent with its role in transcriptionalactivation, JMJD6 is required for estrogen/ERα-induced breast cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis. Our data have uncovered a critical regulator ofestrogen/ERα-induced enhancer coding gene activation and breast cancer cellpotency, providing a potential therapeutic target of ER-positive breast cancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
