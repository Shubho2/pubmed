The aim of the study was toassociate clinic and oncologic characteristics with the possibility of survivalfor ≥ 1 year.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort in two referral centers recollectedclinical and oncologic data from patients diagnosed with CNSm. Chronic metastaseswere defined as those patients that survived for ≥ 12 months after the diagnosis of CNSm.RESULTS: Of 613 patients with CNSm, 554 had solid tumors as the primary cancerand were included; 405 (73%) were women, the most common primary cancer site werebreast, lung and urologic. Chronic CNSm were found in 260 (47%) and were comparedto those who did not. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, variables associated with good prognosis (living > 12 months) were: female sex (HR 0.55),single CNSm (HR 0.39), diagnosis of CNSm during initial extension studies orduring presentation of cancer (HR 0.43), and occipital location (HR 0.62).CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival in patients with CNSm remains a topic of debate; their bad prognosis could be changing towards improvement. Clinical findings are typically overlooked in CNSm reports and prognostic scales. After our findings,we propose to include them in forthcoming studies to aid prognosticconsiderations. Factors associated with prolonged survival found in our studyinclude female gender, timing of CNSm diagnosis, occipital lobe location, andsingle CNSm.DOI: 10.1007/s11060-018-2946-x PMID: 30003395
