However, continuous exposure to NAMPT inhibitors, such as FK866, can induce acquired resistance.Methods: We developed FK866-resistant CCRF-CEM (T cell acute lymphoblasticleukemia) and MDA MB231 (breast cancer) models, and by exploiting an integratedapproach based on genetic, biochemical, and genome wide analyses, we annotatedthe drug resistance mechanisms.Results: Acquired resistance to FK866 was independent of NAMPT mutations butrather was based on a shift towards a glycolytic metabolism and on lactatedehydrogenase A (LDHA) activity. In addition, resistant CCRF-CEM cells, whichexhibit high quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) activity, alsoexploited amino acid catabolism as an alternative source for NAD+ production,becoming addicted to tryptophan and glutamine and sensitive to treatment with theamino acid transport inhibitor JPH203 and with l-asparaginase, which affectsglutamine exploitation. Vice versa, in line with their low QPRT expression,FK866-resistant MDA MB231 did not rely on amino acids for their resistancephenotype.Conclusions: Our study identifies novel mechanisms of resistance to NAMPTinhibition, which may be useful to design more rational strategies for targeting cancer metabolism.DOI: 10.1186/s40170-018-0174-7 PMCID: PMC5844108PMID: 29541451
