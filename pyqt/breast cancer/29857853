Thepostoperative presence of residual FGT (RFGT) is associated with remaining cancerrisk. This study evaluated the role of MRI in the quantitative assessment of RFGTand its impact on the estimation of the remaining breast cancer risk.METHODS: The postoperative MRI scans (following EUSOMA recommendations) of 58patients who had undergone SSM or NSM between 2003 and 2013, as well aspreoperative MRI scans that were available in 25 of these patients, wereretrospectively evaluated for the presence and location of RFGT by threeradiologists. Two different observers quantitatively assessed the volume andpercentage of retromamillary and other RFGT (RFGTrm and RFGTother) were assessed.The Fisher's exact test, the Student's t-test, and intraclass coherence were usedto compare patient groups and to assess reproducibility.RESULTS: RFGT was found in 20% of all breasts and significantly more frequentlyafter NSM than SSM (50% vs. 13%, p = .003). RFGTrm and RFGTother were moreprevalent after NSM (p < 0.001; p = .127). RFGT ranged from 0.5 to 26% of thepreoperative FGT, with higher percentages after NSM than SSM (p = .181).CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and percentage of RFGT found on MRI indicate aconsiderable remaining postoperative breast cancer risk in some women.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
