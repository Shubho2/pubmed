However, itsassociation with breast cancer is still unclear.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed L1-CAM expression and serum sL1 levels incancer and para-carcinoma tissues from 162 consecutive patients with primaryinvasive breast cancer (PBC) using immunohistochemistry and an enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay, respectively. The serum sL1 levels were also examined in 38 patients with benign breast disease and 36 healthy controls.RESULTS: L1-CAM was expressed more frequently in cancer tissues than inpara-carcinoma tissues (24.1% vs. 5.6%; P < .001), and the mean sL1 levels weresignificantly greater in PBC than in those with benign breast disease and healthycontrols (P = .027). Both L1-CAM+ expression and higher mean sL1 levelscorrelated significantly with larger tumor size, lymph node involvement, higherhistologic grade, advanced TNM stage, and shorter disease-free survival for PBCpatients. Moreover, higher mean sL1 levels were also significantly associatedwith estrogen receptor-α-negative expression, human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2-positive (HER2+) expression, HER2-enriched and triple-negativemolecular subtypes, and L1-CAM+ expression (P < .05). On multivariate analysis,larger tumor size, nodal involvement, HER2+, and higher sL1 levels (≥ 0.7 ng/mL) were independent factors associated with L1-CAM+ expression (P < .05). Noassociation was found between L1-CAM expression or sL1 level with age, gender,histologic type, or expression of progesterone receptor, Ki-67, p53, or vascular endothelial growth factor C (P > .05).CONCLUSION: These results indicate that L1-CAM and sL1 are elevated in PBC andboth might affect the prognosis of PBC patients. In addition, sL1 might be auseful marker for screening and diagnosis.Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2017.12.011 PMID: 29510897
