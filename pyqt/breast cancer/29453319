Preclinical models of TNBC were used to test the hypothesis thatincreased leptin signaling drives obesity-associated TNBC development bypromoting cancer stem cell (CSC) enrichment and/or epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition (EMT). MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic mice, which develop spontaneousbasal-like, triple-negative mammary tumors, received either a control diet (10%kcal from fat) or a diet-induced obesity regimen (DIO, 60% kcal from fat) for up to 42 weeks (n = 15/group). Mice were monitored for tumor development andeuthanized when tumor diameter reached 1.5 cm. Tumoral gene expression wasassessed via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). DIO mice had greater body weight andpercent body fat at termination than controls. DIO mice, versus controls,demonstrated reduced survival, increased systemic metabolic and inflammatoryperturbations, upregulated tumoral CSC/EMT gene signature, elevated tumoralaldehyde dehydrogenase activity (a CSC marker), and greater leptin signaling. In cell culture experiments using TNBC cells (murine: E-Wnt and M-Wnt; human:MDA-MB-231), leptin enhanced mammosphere formation, and media supplemented withserum from DIO versus control mice increased cell viability, migration, invasion,and CSC- and EMT-related gene expression, including Foxc2, Twist2, Vim, Akt3, andSox2 In E-Wnt cells, knockdown of leptin receptor ablated these procancer effectsinduced by DIO mouse serum. These findings indicate that increased leptinsignaling is causally linked to obesity-associated TNBC development by promoting CSC enrichment and EMT.Implications: Leptin-associated signals impacting CSC and EMT may provide new targets and intervention strategies for decreasing TNBCburden in obese women.
