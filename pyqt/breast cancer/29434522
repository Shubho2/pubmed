However, its molecular biological functionin triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been entirely clarified. Thisstudy investigated the expression of LAMA4 in TNBC and its effect on cellproliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, we also identified thepotential miRNA directly targeting LAMA4.Methods: Western blot, Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemical staining (IHC) were used to detect the expression of LAMA4 in TNBC. The effectsof LAMA4 on TNBC cell proliferation, migration and invasion were also explored invitro. The potential miRNA that targets LAMA4 was determined by dual luciferasereporter assay and verified by qPCR and western blot analysis.Results: Our study showed LAMA4 mRNA (p = 0.001) and protein (p = 0.005)expression in TNBC tissue samples were elevated compared with adjacent normaltissue samples, and LAMA4 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of breastcarcinoma cells. Knockdown of LAMA4 inhibited TNBC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. Moreover, further study revealed that LAMA4 was a putativetarget of miR-539, and miR-539 negatively regulated LAMA4 expression by directly targeting its 3'-UTR.Conclusions: Our study suggested that miR-539 suppressed the expression of LAMA4.LAMA4 plays an important role in tumor progression and may be an important targetin treatment of TNBC.DOI: 10.1186/s12935-018-0512-4 PMCID: PMC5791727PMID: 29434522
