Electronic address:anupama.mittal@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in.The present study aims at the development of cholesterol based lipopolymericnanoparticles for improved entrapment, better cell penetration and improvedpharmacokinetics of Tamoxifen (TMX). Self-assembling cholesterol graftedlipopolymer, mPEG-b-(CB-{g-chol}-co-LA) was synthesized frompoly(ethyleneglycol)-block-2-methyl-2-carboxyl-propylenecarboxylic acid-co-poly(l-lactide) [mPEG-b-(CB-{g-COOH}-co-LA)] copolymer followed by carbodiimidecoupling for attaching cholesterol. Lipopolymeric nanoparticles were preparedusing o/w solvent evaporation technique, which were subsequently characterized todetermine its particle size, entrapment efficiency, release pattern and compared with mPEG-PLA nanoparticles. Further, in order to assess the in vitro efficacy,cytotoxicity studies, uptake, apoptosis assay and cell cycle analysis wereperformed in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and 4T1). Finally, thepharmacokinetic profile of TMX loaded mPEG-b-(CB-{g-chol}-co-LA) lipopolymericnanoparticles was also performed. TMX loaded lipopolymeric nanoparticles ofparticle size 151.25 ± 3.74 (PDI 0.123) and entrapment efficiency of73.62 ± 3.08% were formulated. The haemolytic index, protein binding and in vitrodrug release of the optimized nanoparticles were found to be comparable to thatof the TMX loaded mPEG-PLA nanoparticles. Lipopolymeric nanoparticlesdemonstrated improved IC50 values in breast cancer cells (22.2 μM in 4T1; 18.8 μMin MCF-7) than free TMX (27.6 μM and 23.5 μM respectively) and higher uptakeefficiency. At IC50 values, TMX loaded lipopolymeric nanoparticles inducedapoptosis and cell cycle arrest (G0/G1 phase) to similar extent as that of freedrug. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated ∼2.5-fold increase in the half-life(t1/2) (p < 0.001) and ∼2.7-fold (p < 0.001) increase in the mean residence time (MRT) of TMX following incorporation into lipopolymeric nanoparticles. Thus,mPEG-b-(CB-{g-chol}-co-LA) lipopolymeric nanoparticles offer a more promisingapproach for delivery of Tamoxifen in breast cancer by improving druginternalization and prolonging the mean residence time of the drug indicatingpossibility of dose reduction and hence bypassing the adverse effects of TMXtherapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
