[Epub ahead of print]STAT3 Activation Confers Trastuzumab-Emtansine (T-DM1) Resistance inHER2-positive Breast Cancer.Wang L(1), Wang Q(1), Gao M(1), Fu L(1), Li Y(1), Quan H(1), Lou L(1).Author information: (1)Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai,201203, China.Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that has beenapproved for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Despite theremarkable efficacy of T-DM1 in many patients, resistance to this therapeutic hasemerged as a significant clinical problem. In the current study, we usedBT-474/KR cells, a T-DM1-resistant cell line established from HER2-positiveBT-474 breast cancer cells, as a model to investigate mechanisms of T-DM1resistance and explore effective therapeutic regimens. We show here for the firsttime that activation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription3) mediated by LIFR (leukemia inhibitory factor receptor) overexpression confers resistance to T-DM1. Moreover, secreted factors induced by activated STAT3 inresistant cells limit the responsiveness of cells that were originally sensitive to T-DM1. Importantly, STAT3 inhibition sensitizes resistant cells to T-DM1, bothin vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the combination T-DM1 with STAT3-targetedtherapy is a potential treatment for T-DM1-refractory patients.
