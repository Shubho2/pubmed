Mostly, cytostaticagents suppressed significantly expression of hBDs. In contrast, vincristinecaused significant up-regulation of hBD-1 (12 fold, p < 0.05) and hBD-4 (2 fold, p < 0.05) in MCF7, and doxorubicin significantly enhanced expression of hBD-3 (2 fold, p < 0.05) and hBD-4 (> 10 fold, p < 0.05) in A431 cells.CONCLUSION: The results of this pilot study show that expression levels ofhBD-1-4 may be altered upon treatment with cytostatic agents depending on nature of cells.PMID: 29600981
