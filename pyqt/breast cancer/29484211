Currently, SABR has been investigated in the neoadjuvant andadjuvant setting with a number of ongoing feasibility studies. However, its usecomes with a number of radiobiological and technical challenges that requirefurther evaluation. We have learned much from other extracranial disease sitessuch as lung, brain, and spine, where definitive treatment with SABR has shownencouraging outcomes. In women with breast cancer, SABR may eliminate the needfor invasive surgery, reducing healthcare costs and hospital stays and providing an additional curative option for early-stage disease. This poses the followingquestion: is there a role for SABR as a definitive therapy in breast cancer?DOI: 10.1155/2018/2734820 PMCID: PMC5816843PMID: 29484211
