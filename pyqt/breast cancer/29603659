Epub 2018Apr 23.Carboxylate Analogues of Aryl-Urea-Substituted Fatty Acids That Target theMitochondria in MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells to Promote Cell Death.Koolaji N(1), Rawling T(2), Bourget K(1), Murray M(1).Author information: (1)Discipline of Pharmacology, School of Medical Sciences, Sydney Medical School,The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.(2)School of Mathematics and Physical Sciences, Faculty of Science, TheUniversity of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, New South Wales, Australia.Selective targeting of the tumor cell mitochondrion is a viable approach for the development of anticancer agents because the organelle is functionally different from the mitochondria of normal cells. We recently developed a novel aryl-ureafatty acid, 16({[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]carbamoyl}amino)hexadecanoic acid (1) that was found to disrupt mitochondria and to activate apoptosis inMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. However, there is currently little information onthe structural requirements for the activity of compound 1 analogues. The presentstudy evaluated the role of the carboxylic acid group on the anticancer activity of 1. Bioisosteric replacement of the carboxylate in 1 maintained activity. Thus,like 1, the sulfonic acid analogue 1-SA and the oxo-thiadiazole analogue 1-OTwere also found to target the mitochondrion and to activate cell killingcapacity. The hydroxamic acid analogue 1-HA also killed MDA-MB-231 cells, but itsonset of action was slower than that of 1-SA and 1-OT. In contrast, replacementof the carboxylate with non-bioisosteric amido and methylamido groups producedanalogues that minimally altered mitochondrial function and showed littlecapacity to decrease tumor cell viability. These findings suggest that thecarboxylate moiety in the novel mitochondrially targeted agent 1 is an important determinant of the kinetics and efficacy of anticancer cell activities ofcompound 1 analogues. Further development of carboxylate-modified analogues ofaryl-urea fatty acids as potential anticancer agents could now be warranted.Â© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
