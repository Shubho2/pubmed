This study aimsto assess the QoL of premenopausal Chinese breast cancer women after receivingadjuvant chemotherapy.Patients and methods: Eligibility criteria included stage I-III breast cancer,premenopausal and age ≤45 years at cancer diagnosis and having received adjuvant chemotherapy within 3-10 years before entry to the present study. Patients'background demographics at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, together withtumor characteristics and anticancer treatments, were collected. At the time ofstudy entry, the menopausal status based on menstrual history, body mass index,and QoL (assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast +4) wererecorded.Results: Two hundred and eighty patients were recruited. Ninety-five patients(33.9%) underwent breast-conserving surgery, and nearly all (98.6%) underwentaxillary dissection. For adjuvant therapies, 249 patients (88.9%) receivedanthracycline-containing chemotherapy and 79 (28.2%) received taxane-containingchemotherapy, while 68 (24.3%) received both. One hundred and eighty six patients(66.4%) received adjuvant radiotherapy, and 214 (76.4%) received adjuvanttamoxifen. The median time from breast cancer diagnosis to study entry was 5.01years. QoL assessment at study entry revealed that older patients had worsesocial well-being (SWB; mean scores for age ≤40, 41-45, 46-50 and >50 years were 22.0, 19.3, 19.1 and 18.1, respectively, P=0.0442). Patients who underwentaxillary dissection had worse scores for breast cancer sub-scale (BCS; mean score22.2 vs. 28.3, P=0.0212). Patients who underwent taxane-containing chemotherapyhad worse scores for arm subscale (mean score 13.8 vs. 15.3, P=0.0053).Conclusion: At a median follow-up of 5 years post-diagnosis, patients who wereyounger had fewer disturbances in their SWB. Patients who had axillary dissectionhad worse BCS scores, while those who received taxane had worse scores for armsubscale. Further studies are warranted for breast-specific QoL to address thespecific issues encountered by breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S149983 PMCID: PMC5826245PMID: 29503585
