Ras-related protein Rab-7a(Rab7a) is involved in late endocytic trafficking, while its role in breastcancer is largely unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Rab7a inbreast cancer. Comparing with adjacent breast tissues, Rab7a expression wasincreased in breast cancer tissues. Using lentivirus-mediated knockdown strategy,we found that Rab7a silencing inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ofMDA-MB-231 cells. Apoptosis and G2 cell cycle arrest were induced in Rab7aknockdown. By contrast, Rab7a suppressed the apoptosis and promoted proliferationand colony formation of MCF-7 cells. The migration of MDA-MB-231 cells wassuppressed by Rab7a knockdown. In vivo, depletion of Rab7a inhibited thexenograft tumor development of MDA-MB-231 cells. Altogether, our resultshighlight the novel function of Rab7a in the proliferation, invasion andxenograft tumor development of breast cancer cells.Â©2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20180480 PMID: 29769411
