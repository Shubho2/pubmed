The second aim was to determinate the most frequent cause for thetreatment discontinuation, recurrence rate, as well as the site of most commonlocalization of the first recurrence of disease.METHODS: This research was conducted as a retrospective study at the UniversityOncology Clinic, Clinical Centre in Nis. The study included 238 patients who wereoperated and treated for HER2-positive breast cancer between January 1st, 2007 toSeptember 30th, 2012 and followed up until December 31st, 2016. Trastuzumab wasadministered concurrently with taxanes, if administered, or after the completedanthracycline-based chemotherapy.RESULTS: After a median follow up of 69 months the 5-year DFI was 65.9% and5-year OS was 81.8% and, as expected, significantly longer in the group ofpatients with smaller tumors, a smaller number of positive axillary lymph nodes, as well as a lower stage of disease (p<0.0001). Patients older than 65 years had a longer DFI compared to the 45-65 and under 45 age groups of patients (p=0.01). No statistical significance was found in the length of DFI in relation to thehistological tumor subtype, tumor grade, or the status of hormone receptors.Unlike DFI, a longer OS was recorded in the group of patients with lower tumorgrade (p=0.03) and there was no statistically significant difference in survival regarding the age of patients (p=0.07). Recurrence occurred in approximately one third of the patients (38.23%), mostly in the form of local recurrence. Adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab was not completely carried out in 18.49% of thepatients, the most common reason being the progression of disease.CONCLUSIONS: A long median follow up period of 69 months indicated that anti-HER2monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, after anthracycline-based chemotherapy orconcurrently with taxanes, is efficient and safe in treating early breast cancer.PMID: 29745076
