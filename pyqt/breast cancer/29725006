However, the regulatory roles and mechanisms of BRD7in cancer metabolism are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that BRD7 was lowly expressed in breast cancer tissues and was identified as a poorprognostic factor in breast cancer. Meanwhile, BRD7 could suppress cellproliferation, initiate cell apoptosis and reduce aerobic glycolysis, suggesting that BRD7 plays a tumor suppressive roles in breast cancer. Mechanistically, BRD7could negatively regulate a critical glycolytic enzyme LDHA through directlyinteraction with its upstream transcription factor, HIF1α, facilitatingdegradation of HIF1α mediated by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover,restoring the expression of LDHA in breast cancer cells could reverse the effect of BRD7 on aerobic glycolysis, cell proliferation, and tumor formation, as wellas the expression of cell cycle and apopotosis related molecules such as cyclinD1, CDK4, P21, and c-PARP both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, theseresults indicate that BRD7 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer andrepresses the glycolysis and tumor progression through inactivation of HIF1α/LDHAtranscription axis.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0536-7 PMCID: PMC5938698PMID: 29725006
