To gain insight into these pathways, studies may try toidentify biomarkers that mediate the exposure/disease relationship. Such studies often simultaneously test hundreds or thousands of biomarkers.Results: We consider a set of m biomarkers and a corresponding set of nullhypotheses, where the jth null hypothesis states that biomarker j does notmediate the exposure/disease relationship. We propose a Multiple ComparisonProcedure (MCP) that rejects a set of null hypotheses or, equivalently,identifies a set of mediators, while asymptotically controlling the Family-WiseError Rate (FWER) or False Discovery Rate (FDR). We use simulations to show that,compared to currently available methods, our proposed method has higherstatistical power to detect true mediators. We then apply our method to a breast cancer study and identify nine metabolites that may mediate the knownrelationship between an increased BMI and an increased risk of breast cancer.Availability and implementation: R package MultiMed onhttps://github.com/SiminaB/MultiMed.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformaticsonline.DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty064 PMID: 29420693
