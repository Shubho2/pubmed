TTO High-ResolutionGas Chromatography (HRGC) showed seventeen main constituents, such asTerpinen-4-ol, γ-Terpinene, and α-Terpinene. High TTO concentrations (≥600 μg/mL) showed a remarkable antitumor activity, decreasing cell viability and cell proliferation of MCF-7 and 4T1 cells. TTO at 300 μg/mL increased the number of MCF-7 cells in the early stages of apoptosis and increased the BAX/BCL-2 genesratio. TTO, mainly at 300 μg/mL, decreased cell growth and arrested MCF-7 cellsin the S phase of the cell cycle. Lower antitumor concentrations (≤300 μg/mL)evaluated in MCF-7 and 4T1 cells were not cytotoxic to PBMCs and HFF-1. Also, TTO(300 μg/mL) was able to induce cell proliferation in fibroblasts after 72 h,indicating non-cytotoxic effect in these cells. TTO exhibited in vitro antitumor effect on MCF-7 and 4T1 cells by decreasing cell viability and modulatingapoptotic pathways and cell cycle arrestment of MCF-7 cells. In this sense, ourstudy provides new perspectives on the potential use of TTO for the developmentof new alternative therapies to treat topically locally advanced breast cancer(LABC).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
