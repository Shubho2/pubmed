Since most bones in theface derive from cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs), which are multipotent stemcells, craniofacial bone disorders are largely attributed to defects in CNCCs.However, it remains unclear how the niche of CNCCs is coordinated by multiplegene regulatory networks essential for craniofacial bone development. Here wereport that tumor suppressors breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer 2 (BRCA2)are required for craniofacial bone development in mice. Disruption of Brca1 inCNCC-derived mesenchymal cells, but not in epithelial-derived cells, resulted in craniofacial skeletal defects. Whereas osteogenic differentiation was normal,both osteogenic proliferation and survival were severely attenuated in Brca1mutants. Brca1-deficient craniofacial skeletogenic precursors displayed increasedDNA damage and enhanced cell apoptosis. Importantly, the craniofacial skeletaldefects were sufficiently rescued by superimposing p53 null alleles in a neuralcrest-specific manner in vivo, indicating that BRCA1 deficiency induced DNAdamage, cell apoptosis, and that the pathogenesis of craniofacial bone defectscan be compensated by inactivation of p53. Mice lacking Brca2 in CNCCs, but notin epithelial-derived cells, also displayed abnormalities resembling thecraniofacial skeletal malformations observed in Brca1 mutants. Our data shedlight on the importance of BRCA1/BRCA2 function in CNCCs during craniofacialskeletal formation.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1007340 PMCID: PMC5951594PMID: 29718910  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
