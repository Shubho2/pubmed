At first surgery, they had received SLNB (46.5%), axillary lymph nodedissection (ALND) (36.6%) or no axillary surgery (16.9%).RESULTS: Lymphatic migration was successful in 53 out of 71 patients (74.6%) and was significantly higher in patients with previous SLNB or no axillary surgerythan in those with previous ALND (87.9% vs. 53.8%; p = 0.009). Aberrant lymphaticmigration pathways were observed in 7 patients (13.2%). The surgical SLNB wassuccessfully performed in 51 patients (71.8%). In 46 patients (90.2%) the SLN washistologically negative, in 3 patients (5.9%) micrometastastatic and in 2patients (3.9%) macrometastatic. The 2 patients with a macrometastates in SLNunderwent ALND, In 4 out of the 18 patients with failure of tracer migrationALND, performed as surgeon's choice, did not find any metastatic node. After amedian follow-up period of 39 months (range: 2-182 months), no axillaryrecurrence has been diagnosed.CONCLUSION: A SLNB in patients with locally recurrent breast cancer, no previous ALND and negative axillary lymph nodes is technically feasible and impacts on theALND rate. In patients who at primary surgery received ALND, migration rate issignificantly lower, aberrant migration is frequent and no clinically usefulinformation has been obtained.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
