This may be particularly salient in youth whoface concurrent challenges such as establishing autonomy and making vocationalchoices.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate stigma prevalence in youth (aged 14-24 years) with type 1 diabetes and its associations with glycemic control.METHODS: Participants, recruited largely through social media, were asked tocomplete a Web-based survey and to send via mail capillary blood samples forglycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement. The primary definition of stigmarequired endorsement of one or more of 3 stigma-specific items of the Barriers toDiabetes Adherence questionnaire. These addressed avoidance of diabetesmanagement with friends present, difficulty telling others about diabetesdiagnosis, and embarrassment in performing diabetes care with others present.Poor glycemic control was defined as HbA1c>9% (ie, >75 mmol/mol; measured valuewhen available, else self-report) and/or ≥1 severe hypoglycemic episode in theprevious year (reported requiring assistance from someone else during theepisode). Stigma prevalence was computed (95% CI), and associations with glycemiccontrol were evaluated (multivariate logistic regression models).RESULTS: Among the 380 respondents, stigma prevalence was 65.5% (95% CI60.7-70.3). Stigma was associated with a 2-fold higher odds of poor glycemiccontrol overall (odds ratio [OR] 2.25, 95% CI 1.33-3.80; adjusted for age, sex,and type of treatment). There were specific associations with both HbA1c>9% (75mmol/mol; OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.36-6.86) and severe hypoglycemia in the previous year(OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.05-3.31).CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of stigma in youth with type 1 diabetesthat is associated with both elevated HbA1c levels and severe hypoglycemia.Targeted strategies to address stigma are needed.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02796248;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02796248 (Archived by WebCite athttp://www.webcitation.org/6yisxeV0B).©Anne-Sophie Brazeau, Meranda Nakhla, Michael Wright, Mélanie Henderson,Constadina Panagiotopoulos, Daniele Pacaud, Patricia Kearns, Elham Rahme, DeborahDa Costa, Kaberi Dasgupta.
