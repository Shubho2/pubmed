Cytotoxic chemotherapy may reducetumor bulk, but leaves residual disease due to the persistence ofchemotherapy-resistant breast cancer stem cells (BCSC), which are critical fortumor recurrence and metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia-induciblefactor (HIF)-1-dependent regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)signaling pathways contributes to chemotherapy-induced BCSC enrichment.Chemotherapy increased DUSP9 expression and decreased DUSP16 expression in aHIF1-dependent manner, leading to inhibition of ERK and activation of p38signaling pathways, respectively. Inhibition of ERK caused transcriptionalinduction of the pluripotency factor Nanog through decreased inactivatingphosphorylation of FoxO3, while activation of p38 stabilized Nanog and Klf4 mRNA through increased inactivating phosphorylation of RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1,both of which promoted specification of the BCSC phenotype. Inhibition of HIF1 orp38 signaling blocked chemotherapy-induced pluripotency factor expression andBCSC enrichment. These surprising results delineate a mechanism by which atranscription factor switches cells from ERK to p38 signaling in response tochemotherapy and suggest that therapeutic targeting of HIF1 or the p38 pathway incombination with chemotherapy will block BCSC enrichment and improve outcome inTNBC.Significance: These findings provide a molecular mechanism that may account for the increased relapse rate of women with TNBC who are treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and suggest that combining chemotherapy with an inhibitor of HIF1 orp38 activity may increase patient survival.
