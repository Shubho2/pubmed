We examined associations of adolescent and early adulthood intakes of totalcarbohydrates, glycemic index/load, fiber, and simple sugars with breast density among 182 young women.METHODS: Diet was assessed using three 24-h recalls at each of five DietaryIntervention Study in Children (DISC) clinic visits when participants were age10-19 years and at the DISC06 Follow-Up Study clinic visit when participants wereage 25-29 years. Associations between energy-adjusted carbohydrates andMRI-measured percent dense breast volume (%DBV) and absolute dense breast volume (ADBV) at 25-29 years were quantified using multivariable-adjusted mixed-effects linear models.RESULTS: Adolescent sucrose intakes and premenarcheal total carbohydrates intakeswere modestly associated with higher %DBV (mean %DBVQ1 vs Q4, 16.6 vs 23.5% forsucrose; and 17.2 vs 22.3% for premenarcheal total carbohydrates, allPtrend ≤ 0.02), but not with ADBV. However, adolescent intakes of fiber andfructose were not associated with %DBV and ADBV. Early adulthood intakes of totalcarbohydrates, glycemic index/load, fiber, and simple sugars were not associated with %DBV and ADBV.CONCLUSIONS: Insulinemic carbohydrate diet during puberty may be associated with adulthood breast density, but our findings need replication in larger studies.Clinical Trials Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, NCT00458588 April 9, 2007; NCT00000459 October 27, 1999.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1040-1 PMID: 29802491
