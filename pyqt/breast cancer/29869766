The number of collected oocytes, days of stimulation, total gonadotropin dosage and gonadotropin dosage per day were evaluated.RESULTS: Total oocyte number was negatively correlated with increasing age(r = 0.237, p < 0.0001). Oocyte numbers were in women < 26 years 15.4 ± 8.8,26-30 years 13.1 ± 8.5, 31-35 years 12.2 ± 7.7 and 36-40 years 9.9 ± 8.0.Age-adjusted oocyte numbers were not different in women with Hodgkin's lymphoma(12.6 ± 8.8), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (12.4 ± 8.2), leukaemia (11.7 ± 8.2),sarcoma (11.8 ± 8.2), cerebral cancer (16.5 ± 8.1), gastrointestinal cancer(13.2 ± 8.1) gynaecological cancer (10.8 ± 8.2) and other types of malignancies(15.8 ± 8.1) apart from ovarian cancer with lower oocyte yield (7.3 ± 8.3,p < 0.001) compared to women with breast cancer (13.3 ± 8.8). The totalgonadotropin dose used for stimulation was only elevated in Hodgkin's andnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma compared to women with breast cancer (p < 0.05). Oocyteyield was lower in women with versus without ovarian cancer (p < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: As ovarian response is not affected by the type of cancer, ovarianstimulation can be performed with the same oocyte yield in different malignantdiseases. However, oocyte yield is reduced if ovarian surgery is required and in older women.DOI: 10.1007/s10815-018-1227-0 PMID: 29869766
