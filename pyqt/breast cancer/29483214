In this study, in vitro and in vivo preclinical breast cancermodels were used to investigate the expanded use of the CDK4/6 inhibitor,abemaciclib. Using a panel of 44 breast cancer cell lines, differentialsensitivity to abemaciclib was observed and was seen predominately in the luminalER+/HER2- and ER+/HER2+ subtypes. However, a subset of triple-negative breastcancer (TNBC) cell lines with intact Rb signaling were also found to beresponsive. Equivalent levels of tumor growth inhibition were observed inER+/HER2-, ER+/HER2+ as well as biomarker selected TNBC xenografts in response toabemaciclib. In addition, abemaciclib combined with hormonal blockade and/orHER2-targeted therapy induced significantly improved antitumor activity. CDK4/6inhibition with abemaciclib combined with antimitotic agents, both in vitro andin vivo, did not antagonize the effect of either agent. Finally, we identified a set of Rb/E2F-regulated genes that consistently track with growth inhibitoryresponse and constitute potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers of response toabemaciclib. Taken together, these data represent a comprehensive analysis of thepreclinical activity of abemaciclib, used alone or in combination, in humanbreast cancer models. The subtypes most likely to respond to abemaciclib-basedtherapies can be identified by measurement of a specific set of biomarkersassociated with increased dependency on cyclinD:CDK4/6:Rb signaling. These datasupport the clinical development of abemaciclib as monotherapy or as acombination partner in selected ER+/HER2-, HER2+/ER+, and TNBCs.
