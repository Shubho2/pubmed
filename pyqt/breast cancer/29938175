R.China.Clinical evidence indicates that drug resistance is a great obstacle in breastcancer therapy. It renders the disease uncontrollable and causes high mortality. Multiple mechanisms contribute to the development of drug resistance, but theunderlying cause is usually a shift in the genetic composition of tumor cells. Itis increasingly feasible to engineer the genome with the clustered regularlyinterspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/associated (Cas)9 technologyrecently developed, which might be advantageous in overcoming drug resistance.This article discusses how the CRISPR/Cas9 system might revert resistance genemutations and identify potential resistance targets in drug-resistant breastcancer. In addition, the challenges that impede the clinical applicability ofthis technology and highlight the CRISPR/Cas9 systems are presented. TheCRISPR/Cas9 system is poised to play an important role in preventing drugresistance in breast cancer therapy and will become an essential tool forpersonalized medicine.DOI: 10.1002/advs.201700964 PMCID: PMC6010891PMID: 29938175
