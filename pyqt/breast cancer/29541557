BM leads to serious sequelae ofpain, fractures, spinal cord compression and hypercalcemia. Radiotherapy has anestablished role in relieving pain caused by BM. Worldwide different radiotherapyschedules are being used for BM. The aim of this study is to determine theefficacy of single fraction palliative radiotherapy for painful bone metastases. Methods Between April 2014 and April 2017, single fraction radiotherapy was used to treat 73 patients in our institution. They had pathologically proven breast,prostate, lung or renal cancer with radiological evidence of bone metastases.There were 39 males (53%) and 34 females (47%). The median age was 58 years(range 33-87 years). 39% patients (n = 28) had breast cancer, 35% had prostatecancer (n = 26), 23% had lung cancer (n = 17), and 3% had renal cancer (n =2).Â On presentation, all the patients had a pain score of more than five on BriefPain Inventory (BPI). Results Response assessment to pain after three months fromsingle fraction radiotherapy was found to be complete response (CR) in 23%patients (n = 17), partial response (PR) in 38% patients (n = 28), stable disease(SD) in 26% patients (n = 19) and progressive disease (PD) in 12% patients (n =9). The overall efficacy of treatment was 62%, with CR 23% and PR 38%.Pre-treatment mean pain score was 8.15 compared to 4.68 post-treatment (p <0.001). Conclusions Single fraction palliative radiotherapy of 8 Gy showedsignificant efficacy in painful bone metastases in our setting and merits furtherinvestigation in our population.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2036 PMCID: PMC5843385PMID: 29541557
