We developed an iPhoneapplication (app) to help BRCA carriers manage their surveillance. We exploredbaseline awareness and adherence to surveillance guidelines and analytic datafrom 21 months of app use. Descriptive statistics were calculated on responses(N = 86) to a survey about surveillance awareness and practices. The majoritywere aware of breast surveillance guidelines, but only one third were aware ofovarian surveillance guidelines. In practice, the majority reported a clinicalbreast exam within 6 months, just over half reported a mammogram and breast MRIin the last year, and under half reported ovarian surveillance in the last year. Nearly 50% reported difficulty remembering appointments. Although only 69received access codes, 284 unique users attempted to enter the app, which wasvisible in the iTunes store but only available to those with a study code.Evaluation of analytic data demonstrated user engagement with study participants accessing the app 427 times over the 21-month time period (range 2-57;mean = 6.28). Results indicate participants were more likely to know screeningguidelines than practice them. There was interest in the app and users wereengaged, suggesting app value. We will send a follow-up survey after 18 months ofapp use for additional evaluation and feedback.DOI: 10.1007/s10897-018-0224-x PMID: 29429041
