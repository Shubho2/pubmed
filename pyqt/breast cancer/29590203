Duncan Cancer Center, Baylor College ofMedicine, Houston, TX, United States of America.The tumor suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in human breast cancer and isa marker for poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Transplantation ofp53 null mouse mammary epithelium into syngeneic wild-type mice leads to normalmammary gland development followed by spontaneous mammary tumors thatrecapitulate many of the phenotypic, molecular and genetic features of humanbreast cancer. Transient exposure of p53 null mice to the anti-estrogen,tamoxifen leads to sustained and robust protection against tumor development.However the mechanism underlying this anti-tumor activity remains poorlyunderstood. Here we demonstrate that transient exposure to tamoxifen leads to areduction in mammary ductal side-branching and epithelial cell proliferationafter tamoxifen withdrawal. Global gene expression analysis showed that transienttamoxifen exposure leads to persistent changes in the expression of a subset ofestrogen regulated gene signatures in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Amongthese was the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 5 (Ptpn5). We show that Ptpn5 is a novel tamoxifen regulated target gene which is upregulated inMECs after transient tamoxifen exposure and displays tumor suppressor activity inhuman breast cancer cells. Further, PTPN5 expression is strongly associated with good clinical outcome in tamoxifen treated human breast cancer patientssuggesting that PTPN5 may represent a novel biomarker of tamoxifen response inhuman breast cancer.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194913 PMCID: PMC5874056PMID: 29590203  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
