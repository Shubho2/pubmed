It comprises two types: melanoma andnonmelanoma skin cancers. Of the nonmelanomas, basal cell carcinoma (BCC)constitutes about 80% of the cancers diagnosed every year. BCC usually occurs in sun-exposed areas such as the face and extremities. Occurrence in the nippleareolar complex is very rare. We present a case of a Caucasian woman whopresented with what was initially thought to be invasive carcinoma of the breast involving the nipple areolar complex (NAC); however, the diagnosis was revealedto be a basal cell carcinoma after histopathological examination. The tumor wastreated with modified radical mastectomy, with negative margins. The importanceof this case lies in the rare site of presentation of basal cell carcinoma andthe importance of early detection.DOI: 10.1155/2018/5302185 PMCID: PMC6051126PMID: 30057838
