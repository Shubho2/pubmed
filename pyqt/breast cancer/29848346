Finding novel markers or related pathways could help eradicate or diagnose cancer in clinic.METHODS: By constructing STARD13-correlated ceRNA 3'UTR stable overexpression or knockdown breast cancer cells, we aimed to explore the effects ofSTARD13-correlated ceRNA network on breast cancer stemness in vitro and in vivo. Further RNA-sequencing was used to analyze transcriptome change in combinationwith functional studies on candidate signaling. Clinical samples obtained fromThe Cancer Genome Atlas data were used to validate the correlation betweenSTARD13 and related pathways. Finally, in vitro and in vivo experiments were usedto examine the effects of STARD13-correlated ceRNA network on chemotherapysensitivity/resistance.RESULTS: Here, we revealed that this ceRNA network inhibited stemness of breastcancer. Mechanistically, we found that activation of STARD13-correlated ceRNAnetwork was negatively correlated with YAP/TAZ activity in breast cancer.Specifically, this ceRNA network attenuated YAP/TAZ nuclear accumulation andtranscriptional activity via collectively modulating Hippo and Rho-GTPase/F-actinsignaling. Finally, we demonstrated that YAP/TAZ transcriptional activityregulated by this ceRNA network was involved in chemoresistance.CONCLUSIONS: Our results uncover a novel mechanism of YAP/TAZ activation inbreast cancer and propose the possibility to drive STARD13-correlated ceRNAnetwork to inhibit breast cancer stem cell traits.DOI: 10.1186/s13045-018-0613-5 PMCID: PMC5977742PMID: 29848346
