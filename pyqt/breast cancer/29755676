Here wesought to define the repertoire of mutations private to or enriched for inHER2-positive brain metastases. Massively parallel sequencing targeting all exonsof 254 genes frequently mutated in breast cancers and/or related to DNA repairwas used to characterize the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of HER2-positive breast cancers and their brain metastases in six patients. Data were analyzedwith state-of-the-art bioinformatics algorithms and selected mutations werevalidated with orthogonal methods. Spatial and temporal inter-lesion geneticheterogeneity was observed in the HER2-positive brain metastases from an indexpatient subjected to a rapid autopsy. Genetic alterations restricted to the brainmetastases included mutations in cancer genes FGFR2, PIK3CA and ATR, homozygousdeletion in CDKN2A and amplification in KRAS. Shifts in clonal composition andthe acquisition of additional mutations in the progression from primaryHER2-positive breast cancer to brain metastases following anti-HER2 therapy were investigated in additional five patients. Likely pathogenic mutations private to or enriched in the brain lesions affected cancer and clinically actionable genes,including ATR, BRAF, FGFR2, MAP2K4, PIK3CA, RAF1 and TP53. Changes in clonalcomposition and the acquisition of additional mutations in brain metastases mayaffect potentially actionable genes in HER2-positive breast cancers. Ourobservations have potential clinical implications, given that treatment decisionsfor patients with brain metastatic disease are still mainly based on biomarkersassessed in the primary tumor.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25041 PMCID: PMC5945519PMID: 29755676
