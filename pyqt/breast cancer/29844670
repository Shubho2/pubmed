QCT has low solubility in water and poor bioavailability, whichlimited its use as a therapeutic molecule. Polymeric micelles (PMs) is a noveldrug delivery system having characteristics like smaller particle size, higherdrug loading, sustained drug release, high stability, increased cellular uptakeand improved therapeutic potential. In the present study, we have formulated and characterized mixed PMs (MPMs) containing QCT for increasing its anticancerpotential.Methods: The MPMs were prepared by thin film hydration method, and theirphysicochemical properties were characterized. The in vitro anticancer activityof the MPMs were tested in breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, epithelial andmetastatic cancer cell lines, respectively), and ovarian (SKOV-3 and NCI/ADR,epithelial and multi-drug resistant cell lines, respectively) cancer.Results: The optimal MPM formulations were obtained from Pluronic polymers, P123 and P407 with molar ratio of 7:3 (A16); and P123, P407 and TPGS in the molarratio of 7:2:1 (A22). The size of the particles before lyophilization (24.83±0.44nm) and after lyophilisation (37.10±4.23 nm), drug loading (8.75±0.41%), andencapsulation efficiency (87.48±4.15%) for formulation A16 were determined. Forformulation A22, the particle size before lyophilization, after lyophilization,drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were 26.37±2.19 nm, 45.88±13.80 nm,9.01±0.11% and 90.07±1.09%, respectively. The MPMs exhibited sustained release ofQCT compared to free QCT as demonstrated from in vitro release experiments. Thesolubility of QCT was markedly improved compared to pure QCT. The MPMs werehighly stable in aqueous media as demonstrated by their low critical micelleconcentration. The concentration which inhibited 50% growth (IC50) values of bothmicellar preparations in all the cancer cell lines were significantly lesscompared to free QCT.Conclusion: Both the MPMs containing QCT could be used for effective delivery to different type of cancer and may be considered for further development.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S153094 PMCID: PMC5961470PMID: 29844670  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
