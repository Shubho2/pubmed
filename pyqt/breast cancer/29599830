Althoughstudies have validated the role of β-inducible gene-h3 (βig-h3) in human biology and disease, the detailed mechanisms mediated by βig-h3 in breast carcinomametastasis remain unclear. Thus, the present study investigated the role andpotential mechanism of βig-h3 during breast carcinoma cell metastasis. Theresults indicated that the upregulation of βig-h3 significantly promotes thegrowth and inhibits the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of breast carcinoma cells. Itwas also demonstrated that βig-h3 promoted the migration and invasion of humanbreast carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the resultsdemonstrated that βig-h3 upregulated the overall expression and phosphorylationof phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) in humanbreast carcinoma cells. By contrast, βig-h3 knockdown reversed theβig-h3-mediated characteristics of breast carcinoma cells. Thus, the currentstudy demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway serves a role inβig-h3-induced human breast cancer cell metastasis and that βig-h3 transfectionenhances the metastatic potential of human breast carcinoma cells via thePI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These observations contribute to the understanding ofthe potential mechanism of human breast carcinoma cell growth and metastasis and suggest that βig-h3 may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment ofhuman breast carcinoma.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2018.5786 PMCID: PMC5867474PMID: 29599830
