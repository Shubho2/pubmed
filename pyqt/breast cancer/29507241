Here we report pHLIP constructsthat significantly improve the targeted delivery of agents into tumor cells. The investigated constructs include pHLIP bundles (conjugates consisting of two orfour pHLIP peptides linked by polyethylene glycol) and Var3 pHLIPs containingeither the nonstandard amino acid, Î³-carboxyglutamic acid, or aglycine-leucine-leucine motif. The performance of the constructs in vitro and in vivo was compared with previous pHLIP variants. A wide range of experiments wasperformed on nine constructs including (i) biophysical measurements usingsteady-state and kinetic fluorescence, circular dichroism, and oriented circular dichroism to study the pH-dependent insertion of pHLIP variants across themembrane lipid bilayer; (ii) cell viability assays to gauge the pH-dependentpotency of peptide-toxin constructs by assessing the intracellular delivery ofthe polar, cell-impermeable cargo molecule amanitin at physiological and low pH(pH 7.4 and 6.0, respectively); and (iii) tumor targeting and biodistributionmeasurements using fluorophore-peptide conjugates in a breast cancer mouse model.The main principles of the design of pHLIP variants for a range of medicalapplications are discussed.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1715350115 PMCID: PMC5866553 [Available on 2018-09-20]PMID: 29507241
