Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2018 Apr 27;19(4):1119-1125.Evaluating the Oncogenic and Tumor Suppressor Role of XPO5 in Different TissueTumor TypesKhan M(1), Khan Z, Uddin Y, Mustafa S, Shaukat I, Pan J, HÃ¶ti N.Author information: (1)Department of Physiology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Kohat, Pakistan.Email: nhoti1@jhmi.eduThe miRNAs nuclear export protein XPO5 has been previously studied in severalindividual malignancies. In our recent study we have demonstrated that excesslevels of XPO5 enhanced the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Similarly,there are studies to support the inhibitory role of XPO5 in cancers. In order to evaluate discrepancies in the expression levels of XPO5 in differential tumortypes, we quantified the expression of XPO5 using gene expression RNA-seq datafor several tumor types which were independently confirmed byimmunohistochemistry in multiple organs cancer tissue microarray (TMAs)experiment. We found that while some tumors (Breast, Bladder, Lymph-node, Lung,Esophagus and Ovary) showed higher differences between normal and malignanttumors in XPO5 expression, there were tissues (Kidney and Brain) that have asignificantly lower XPO5 expression in malignant tumors. We further studies theseobservations of overexpression and down-regulation of XPO5 in breast and kidneycancer cell lines and found that XPO5 might have a dual role in promoting orinhibiting tumor growth in different cancer tissue types.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.1119 PMCID: PMC6031805PMID: 29699373
