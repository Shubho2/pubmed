The average life expectancy of an 80-year-old woman is 9.7 years andchronologic age alone should not be a factor in withholding therapy. Women overage 80 should be treated on an individual basis, taking into account theiroverall health and life expectancy, their risk of dying from breast cancer versusother causes, and the benefits versus toxicities of therapies for their tumor.Invaluable online tools are readily available to easily assess life expectancy(ePrognosis), as well as the absolute survival benefits for every tumor type and stage in individual patients (PREDICT, Ajuvant!). This information should bepresented to the patient so that they are able to make an informed decision basedon their goals, wishes and quality of life. Vulnerable patients should not bebullied or scared into taking unwanted or unnecessary treatments.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
