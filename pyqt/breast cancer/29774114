Theincidence rate for breast cancer in the EU was 106.6/100,000, the mortality rate - 22.4/100,000. In 2014 the incidence rate for cervical cancer in Poland was8.8/100,000, the mortality rate - 4.5/100,000. The incidence rate in the EU was11.3/100,000 and the mortality rate - 3.7/100,000.Objective: The aim of the paper was to establish the number of health policyprogrammes concerned with breast cancer and cervical cancer in women carried out in 2009-2014 by local government units, with specification of the type ofprogramme, type of local government units that carried out the programmes and thecosts of implementation of the programmes.Methods: The study was based on a desk research. The analysis covered dataincluded in annual reports submitted by voivodes to Minister of Health,concerning health policy programmes implemented by local government units in2009-2014.Results: The greatest number of programmes concerned with prevention of breastcancer and cervical cancer were implemented in municipalities, followed bycounties and finally - self-governed voivodeships. The number of programmesconcerned with primary prevention was three times smaller (656) than the numberof programmes concerned with secondary prevention (2,229). The greatest number ofprimary prevention programmes were implemented in Dolnośląskie, Wielkopolskie andMazowieckie Voivodeships, and the greatest number of secondary preventionprogrammes - in Wielkopolskie, Mazowieckie and Zachodniopomorskie Voivodeships.Conclusion: It was found that the number of programmes implemented by particular local government units and the financial resources employed in the implementationof the programmes were different. It is probable that some of the initiatives of local government units related to secondary prevention coincide with the actions undertaken under the National Programme for Fighting Cancer. The entities thatcarry out breast cancer and cervical cancer prevention programmes need tocoordinate their actions.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24513 PMCID: PMC5955174PMID: 29774114
