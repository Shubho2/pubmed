The previous study has reported theexpression and function of LHX6 in breast cancer (BC). However, its mechanismunderlying BC metastasis remains largely unclear. This study aimed to investigatethe related mechanisms of the tumor-suppressive role of LHX6 in BC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blottingwere used to determine LHX6 mRNA levels and protein expressions in BC tissues andcell lines. LHX6 protein expression was also analyzed in BC tissues and matchednormal breast tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The biologic functions ofLHX6 in BC were explored by CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, and transwellassays in vitro. Finally, we investigated the effect of LHX6 up-regulation onPI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by Western blot.RESULTS: Our results showed that LHX6 was lowly expressed at the mRNA and proteinlevel in BC cancer tissues and cell lines. Ectopic expression of LHX6 inMDA-MB-231 and T-47D suppressed cell growth, migration, and invasion.Mechanistically, our further investigations revealed that the upregulation ofLHX6 inhibited the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.CONCLUSIONS: We firstly provided evidence that LHX6 exerted its anti-tumorfunction on BC via suppressing activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, whicheventually inhibited the progression of BC.PMID: 29863252
