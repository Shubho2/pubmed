A total of 3045 women with a diagnosis of CKDfrom 1996 to 2013 and 3045 multivariable-matched controls (1:1) were selected. Weused Cox regression, and computed hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidenceintervals (95% CIs) to determine the risk of GC or BC in women.The GC incidencerates (IRs, per 10,000 person-years) of the CKD and non-CKD women were 11.02 and 19.09, respectively, contributing to a significantly decreased risk of GCs (crudeHR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39-0.81; adjusted HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30-0.65) in the CKD women. The GC IR was relatively constant in the CKD women among the different agecategories (IR ranged from 8.10 to 12.29). On contrast, the non-CKD women had aprogressive and continuous increase of GC IR in the advanced age, which was more apparent at age ≥50 years (IR 17.16 for 50-59; IR 23.05 for 60-69; and IR 31.62for ≥70, respectively), contributing to the lower risk of GC in the CKD womenthan that in the non-CKD women. There was no difference of BC incidence betweenwomen with and without CKD.The findings of the lower risk of GCs in the CKD womenin Taiwan are worthy of further evaluation.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010157 PMCID: PMC5895333PMID: 29561423  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
