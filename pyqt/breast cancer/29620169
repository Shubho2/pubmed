Lutein, a plant-derived compound and non-vitamin Acarotenoid, has been demonstrated to possess multiple protective propertiesincluding anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress and antitumor effects. Themain objective of the present research was to elucidate the involvement of luteinin the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under hypoxia, the activation of hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1), and the proliferation, invasion andmigration of breast cancer cells. The human breast cancer cell lines MDA‑MB‑157and MCF‑7 were exposed to hypoxic conditions and various concentrations oflutein. An MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]assay was performed to examine cell proliferation, and Annexin V-fluoresceinisothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining was performed to analyze the apoptosisratio. The levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF‑1α), NOTCH signalingmolecules, HES1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated factorswere examined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction andwestern blot analysis. Wound healing and Transwell invasion assays were used todetect the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Intracellular ROSlevels were examined using 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate and flowcytometry. The results revealed that cell proliferation was inhibited by luteinin a dose-dependent manner, and the apoptosis ratio gradually increased withlutein treatment under hypoxia as evident from flow cytometry-based analysis.Exposure to lutein inhibited hypoxia-mediated activation of HIF‑1α, NOTCHsignaling and HES1 expression, and suppressed the hypoxia-induced expression ofEMT-associated factors. Lutein markedly inhibited the invasion and migration ofbreast cancer cells under hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced production of ROS was alsodecreased by lutein. Furthermore, the ROS scavenger N‑acetylcysteine alsosuppressed hypoxia inducible factor 1α and HES1 expression in breast cancer cellsduring hypoxia, but hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were increased. Takentogether, the results of the present study suggested that lutein may be a novelcandidate for the chemoprevention of breast cancer. Furthermore, HES1 may becrucial in mediating the involvement of lutein in the suppression ofhypoxia-driven ROS-induced breast cancer progression.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4332 PMID: 29620169
