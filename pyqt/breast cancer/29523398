Electronic address:pascal.pigny@chru-lille.fr.The relationship between early recovery of menstrual activity and bloodanti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations were investigated within the firstyear post-chemotherapy in 32 young patients with breast cancer. All were treated by surgery and the same chemotherapy protocol (three cycles of FEC100 plus three cycles of taxanes). Menstrual activity, blood AMH (using picoAMH ELISA) and FSHconcentrations were measured longitudinally before, during and up to 12 monthsafter the end of chemotherapy (six samples per patient). Among the cohort, 17patients recovered spontaneous cycles at +6 months (fast recovery) whereas theremaining 15 patients were still amenorrheic at that time (slow recovery). Blood AMH differed between these two subgroups at each time of the recovery phasestarting at 3 months post-chemotherapy. The AMH patterns were also different:rapid and large increase in the fast recovery versus slow and partial increase inthe slow recovery subgroup. No difference in ovarian recovery was observedbetween patients with a hormone positive or negative tumour. In conclusion,studying the post-chemotherapy patterns of menstrual activity and AMH, two paces of early ovarian recovery are distinguishable in young breast cancer patients whoreceived the same chemotherapy protocol. This suggests different individualovarian susceptibilities to chemotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
