The Internet has become the first choice for the patient whenit comes to gathering detailed information about a disease or problem. Therefore,in view of this frequent occurrence, the information that is provided onlineneeds to be accurate; providing comprehensive facts, transparency, and quality. Astudy was carried out to determine the accuracy of information related to breast cancer on various websites. Websites which share information online about breast cancer, in the Arabic language, were selected. The quality of the websites was tobe evaluated; however, there is no standard method for evaluating the quality of health websites. Hence, a rating form was developed for this study, to determine the completeness and transparency of a specific number of websites using threepopular search engines. A 16-item questionnaire was prepared and validated todetermine the quality of individual websites in addition to using the DISCERNinstrument for assessing consumer health information. Most of the websites(approximately 47%) were deemed to be commercial in nature. Thirty-three percent were developed by non-profit organizations. They disseminated informationconcerning the risk factors (93%), screening, mammography (93%), surgicaltreatment (93%), chemotherapy (89%), radiotherapy (93%), and complementarymedicine (0%) surrounding the treatment of breast cancer. About 67% of thewebsites were estimated to give completely correct information. Incidentally,only five websites had a healthcare professional or expert as the author, whilenine of them had no author. Although numerous breast cancer-related websitesexist, most do a poor job in providing Arabic-speaking women with comprehensiveinformation about breast cancer surgery. Providing easily-accessible,high-quality online information has the potential to significantly improvepatients' experiences.DOI: 10.1007/s13187-018-1378-9 PMID: 29923058
