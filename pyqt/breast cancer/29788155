GDC-0575 is a highly-selective oral small-molecule Chk1 inhibitor thatresults in tumor shrinkage and growth delay in xenograft models. We evaluated thesafety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic properties of GDC-0575 alone and incombination with gemcitabine. Antitumor activity and Chk1 pathway modulation wereassessed.Patients and methods: In this phase I open-label study, in the dose escalationstage, patients were enrolled in a GDC-0575 monotherapy Arm (1) or GDC-0575combination with gemcitabine Arm (2) to determine the maximum tolerated dose.Patients in arm 2 received either i.v. gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 (arm 2a) or500 mg/m2 (arm 2b), followed by GDC-0575 (45 or 80 mg, respectively, as RP2D).Stage II enrolled disease-specific cohorts.Results: Of 102 patients treated, 70% were female, the median age was 59 years(range 27-85), and 47% were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS 0. The mostcommon tumor type was breast (37%). The most frequent adverse events (all grades)related to GDC-0575 and/or gemcitabine were neutropenia (68%), anemia (48%),nausea (43%), fatigue (42%), and thrombocytopenia (35%). Maximum concentrationsof GDC-0575 were achieved within 2 hours of dosing, and half-life was ∼23 hours. No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was observed between GDC-0575 andgemcitabine. Among patients treated with GDC-0575 and gemcitabine, there werefour confirmed partial responses, three occurring in patients with tumorsharboring TP53 mutation. Pharmacodynamic data were consistent with GDC-0575inhibition of gemcitabine-induced expression of pCDK1/2.Conclusion: GDC-0575 can be safely administered as a monotherapy and incombination with gemcitabine; however, overall tolerability with gemcitabine was modest. Hematological toxicities were frequent but manageable. Preliminaryantitumor activity was observed but limited to a small number of patients with a variety of refractory solid tumors treated with GDC-0575 and gemcitabine.Clinical trial number: NCT01564251.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy076 PMID: 29788155
