However, the survival benefit of local treatment remains controversial. The purpose of the presentstudy was to determine whether surgical removal of the primary tumor providessurvival benefits to patients with stage IV breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 155patients with an initial diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer at Seoul NationalUniversity Bundang Hospital from 2003 to 2014. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the median survival. The log-rank test was used to compare differencesin patient and tumor characteristics. Multivariate Cox regression analysis forsurvival was used, controlling for potential confounding variables.RESULTS: Of 155 patients with stage IV breast cancer, 95 (61%) underwent surgicalremoval of the primary tumor. The median follow-up period was 59 months (95%confidence interval [CI], 45-73 months). The median survival was longer for thepatients with a better response to chemotherapy (70 vs. 47 months; P = .010) and for those who had undergone surgery (118 vs. 28 months; P < .001) than for those who without a better chemotherapy response or surgery. The median survival of thepatients who received radiotherapy was better than that of the patients who didnot (65 vs. 39 months; P = .004). Patients with luminal A cancer had a mediansurvival of 118 months, the longest compared with those with other subtypes (P = .001). In addition, patients with distant metastasis at a single site had alonger median survival than did those with multiple metastatic sites. Themultivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that fewer distant metastases,surgery of the primary tumor, a better response to chemotherapy, and luminal Asubtype were significant independent predictors of survival.CONCLUSION: Our results showed that primary tumor removal was independentlyassociated with improvement in survival. Therefore, surgical management for theprimary tumor could be considered more actively in patients with stage IV breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
