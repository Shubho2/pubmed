Common challenges in developingcombination therapies include the potential of additive and aggravated toxicitiesassociated with pharmacologically related adverse effects. We have recentlyreported that combination of anti-HER2 and anti-HER3 antibodies, pertuzumab andlumretuzumab, along with paclitaxel chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer,resulted in a high incidence of diarrhea that ultimately limited further clinicaldevelopment of this combination. Here, we further dissected the diarrhea profile of the various patient dose cohorts and carried out in vitro investigations inhuman colon cell lines and explants to decipher the contribution and themechanism of anti-HER2/3 therapeutic antibodies to intestinal epitheliummalfunction. Our clinical investigations in patients revealed that while dosereduction of lumretuzumab, omission of pertuzumab loading dose, and introduction of a prophylactic antidiarrheal treatment reduced most severe adverse events,patients still suffered from persistent diarrhea during the treatment. Our invitro investigations showed that pertuzumab and lumretuzumab combinationtreatment resulted in upregulation of chloride channel activity withoutindication of intestinal barrier disruption. Overall, our findings provide amechanistic rationale to explore alternative of conventional antigut motilityusing medication targeting chloride channel activity to mitigate diarrhea of HER combination therapies.
