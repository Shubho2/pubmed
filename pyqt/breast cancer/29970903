However, early phase clinical trials of selective FGFR inhibitorsdemonstrated only limited efficacy in FGFR1-amplified breast cancer patients. We found that BGJ398, an FGFR inhibitor, effectively inhibited phosphorylation ofFGFR1 and MEK/ERK signaling in FGFR1-amplified breast cancer without affectingtumor cell proliferation. However, FGFR1 knockout inhibited tumor angiogenesis invivo. We unraveled that FGFR1 regulates the secretion of the proangiogenicvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a MAPK-dependent manner. We further found that FGF-FGFR1 signaling induces an autocrine activation of VEGF-VEGFR1pathway that again amplifies VEGF secretion via VEGF-VEGFR1-AKT signaling.Targeting both VEGFR1 and FGFR1 resulted in synergistic anti-angiogenic treatmenteffects in vivo. We thus postulate synergistic treatment effects inFGFR1/VEGFR1-positive breast cancer patients by dual targeting of FGFR and VEGFR.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0380-3 PMID: 29970903
