Targeted delivery of antitumor breast cancer drugs as adrug-delivery strategy may allow direct delivery into the tumor. Currently,chemotherapy is one of the principle strategies for cancer treatment, but it can have toxic side effects. Nanotechnology attempts to resolve these challenges byloading drugs in nanoparticles, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN). Inresponse to the breast cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), p38MAPK signaling hasbeen investigated since the 1990s. Ribavirin, a nucleotide derivative, inhibitsp38MAPK in infected hepatocytes. A ribavirin prodrug, taribavirin (TBV), wasrecently synthesized to concentrate in the liver and have minimal concentrationin red blood cells.METHODS: In this study, TBV and 5-FU-pegylated SLNs were prepared andcharacterized. The in vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated against MCF-7 breastcancer cells. Using molecular docking experiments, 5-FU and TBV were docked onp38MAPK protein.RESULTS: The TBV nanoformulation had the highest cytotoxic effects, achievingIC50 = 0.690 μM after 24 h, compared with free TBV, which also achieved a goodcytotoxic effect (IC50 = 0.756 μM). However, there was a detectable cytotoxiceffect and an undetectable IC50 of 5-FU nanoparticles and free 5-FU on MCF-7cells.CONCLUSIONS: The effect of TBV nanoparticles on MCF-7 cells may be due to itsinhibitory effect against p38MAPK protein, where it fits inside the active pocketsite of the p38 protein molecular surface, with a minimum binding affinity of-5.5 kcal/mol (rmsd of 1.07), and it formed strong hydrogen bonds with aminoacids ASP'168, ILE'166, HIS'148, and ILE'147. Further studies are warranted toinvestigate the mechanistic details of the proposed approach.DOI: 10.1007/s11095-017-2283-3 PMID: 29488022
