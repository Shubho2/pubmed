Epub 2018 Apr 11.Chemotherapy patient with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome presents to the EmergencyDepartment: A case report.Widmer S(1), Grossman M(2).Author information: (1)Emergency Department, Southside Hospital - Northwell Health, 301 E Main St,Bay Shore, NY 11706, United States. Electronic address: swidmer@northwell.edu.(2)Emergency Department, Southside Hospital - Northwell Health, 301 E Main St,Bay Shore, NY 11706, United States.BACKGROUND: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is part of a continuum of severemucocutaneous reactions, commonly thought to be triggered by certain medications.The syndrome itself is characterized by diffuse necrosis and detachment of theepidermis.CASE REPORT: This case report discusses a patient who presented to the Emergency Department with signs and symptoms of Stevens-Johnson syndrome four days afterchemotherapy administration of ribociclib (KisqaliÂ®). Ribociclib is a newlyapproved, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor indicated for thetreatment of hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. Our case was a 70-year-old female patient with breast cancer who presented four days after her secondadministration of Ribociclib exhibiting skin findings consistent with SJS.Patient was transferred from the Emergency Department to a burn center forfurther management and diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy.CONCLUSIONS: While Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been a rare toxicity, it ispotentially fatal. The emergency physician should pay special attention cancerpatients presenting with suspicious rashes and carefully review theirmedications.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.ajem.2018.04.019 PMID: 29743141
