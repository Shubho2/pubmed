[Epub ahead of print]Long non-coding RNA FEZF1-AS1 promotes breast cancer stemness and tumorigenesisvia targeting miR-30a/Nanog axis.Zhang Z(1), Sun L(1), Zhang Y(1), Lu G(2), Li Y(2), Wei Z(2).Author information: (1)Department of Anesthesiology, Huaihe Hospital, Henan University, Kaifeng,China.(2)Basic Medical School, Henan University, Kaifeng, China.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been verified to modulate the tumorigenesisof breast cancer at multiple levels. In present study, we aim to investigate the role of lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 on breast cancer-stem like cells (BCSC) and thepotential regulatory mechanism. In breast cancer tissue, lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 wasup-regulated compared with controls and indicated poor prognosis of breast cancerpatients. In vitro experiments, FEZF1-AS1 was significantly over-expressed inbreast cancer cells, especially in sphere subpopulation compared with parentalsubpopulation. Loss-of-functional indicated that, in BCSC cells (MDA-MB-231 CSC, MCF-7 CSC), FEZF1-AS1 knockdown reduced the CD44+ /CD24- rate, themammosphere-forming ability, stem factors (Nanog, Oct4, SOX2), and inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion. In vivo, FEZF1-AS1 knockdown inhibited thebreast cancer cells growth. Bioinformatics analysis tools and series ofvalidation experiments confirmed that FEZF1-AS1 modulated BCSC and Nanogexpression through sponging miR-30a, suggesting the regulation ofFEZF1-AS1/miR-30a/Nanog. In summary, our study validate the important role ofFEZF1-AS1/miR-30a/Nanog in breast cancer stemness and tumorigenesis, providing a novel insight and treatment strategy for breast cancer.Â© 2018 The Authors.
