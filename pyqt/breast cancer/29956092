We examined regionalvariation in performance for Commission on Cancer breast quality measures and itsimpact on overall survival (OS) for those measures that have been shown to impactOS.METHODS: Six breast quality measures were analyzed using the National CancerData Base from 2014 to 2015, and a multivariable model was used to assessperformance for each measure by region. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine OS between high- and low-performing centers from 2007to 2012.RESULTS: Overall, 305,391 women had surgery at 1322 institutions in nine USregions; 90.8% underwent needle biopsy (range 86.0-92.6% between regions,p < 0.01), 69.8% had breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for stage 0-II cancer(60.9-79.3%, p < 0.01), 85.2% aged < 70 years had radiation therapy (RT) afterBCS (79.6-90.8%, p < 0.01), 78.3% of women with four or more positive nodes hadpost-mastectomy RT (70.9-84.5%, p < 0.01), 90.9% with hormone receptor(HR)-positive stage IB-III cancer had hormone therapy (83.7-95.1%, p < 0.01), and89.4% aged < 70 years with HR-negative stage IB-III cancer had chemotherapy(87.6-91.4%, p < 0.01). Multivariate analyses adjusted for patient and facilityfactors found that region was the only consistent predictor of non-complianceacross measures. With median 65-month follow-up, there was no difference in OSbetween high- and low-performing centers for the three measures that have beenshown to impact OS.CONCLUSIONS: There is significant regional variation in performance on the breastquality measures but this variation did not impact OS. Targeted efforts incertain areas of the country may help improve performance on these measures.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6592-5 PMID: 29956092
