A cohort of 351 cases (Hormone Receptor (HR)+/HER2-) were stained for PRexpression with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scored according to ASCO/CAPcriteria.RESULTS: The stability of the antigen/antibody complex was greater for the 1E2clone compared to 1A6, 16 and 636 clones. PR IHC on archival tissue resulted in94.3% (299/317) concordance with clones.CONCLUSION: Clones evaluated in this study had a high level of concordance withIHC despite PR (1E2) demonstrating higher analytical binding properties thanother clones. In a minority of cases (1.3% for 1E2 and 2.5% for 636) IHC results could convert estrogen receptor (ER)-/PR- to ER-/PR+ tumors, making thesepatients potentially eligible for endocrine therapy.Copyright Â© 2018.
