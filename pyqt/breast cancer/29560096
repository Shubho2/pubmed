Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proposed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at a number of loci influencingTGCT risk. To further evaluate the association of recently proposed risk SNPswith TGCT at 2q14.2, 3q26.2, 7q36.3, 10q26.13 and 15q21.3, we analyzed genotypedata on 3,206 cases and 7,422 controls. Our analysis provides independentreplication of the associations for risk SNPs at 2q14.2 (rs2713206 at P = 3.03 × 10-2; P-meta = 3.92 × 10-8; nearest gene, TFCP2L1) and rs12912292 at 15q21.3 (P =7.96 × 10-11; P-meta = 1.55 × 10-19; nearest gene PRTG). Case-only analyses didnot reveal specific associations with TGCT histology. TFCP2L1 joins the growinglist of genes located within TGCT risk loci with biologically plausible roles in developmental transcriptional regulation, further highlighting the importance of this phenomenon in TGCT oncogenesis.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23117 PMCID: PMC5849160PMID: 29560096
