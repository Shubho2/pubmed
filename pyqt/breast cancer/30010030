Electronic address: zupko@pharm.u-szeged.hu.Despite emerging new therapeutic opportunities, cancer is still a major healthproblem and a leading cause of death worldwide. Breast tumors are the mostfrequently diagnosed female malignancies, and the triple-negative subtype isassociated with poorer prognosis and lower survival rates than other breastcancer types. The aims of the present study were to determine the anticancerpotency of a set of C-3 and C-16 modified estradiol-derivatives against a panelof breast cancer cell lines, and to characterize the mechanism of action of twoselected compounds (1 and 5) against the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancercell line. Growth-inhibitory properties were investigated by an MTT-assay. Cellcycle analysis by flow cytometry has revealed G1 phase accumulation and indicatedthe proapoptotic effect of 1 and 5 through the elevation of the apoptotic subG1phase on MDA-MB-231 cells after 24 h treatment. The antimetastatic activities of these compounds were examined by wound healing and Boyden chamber assays, andboth compounds were shown to significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells at sub-antiproliferative concentrations. Gelatin zymographyassay has indicated that matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 are not involved inthe antimetastatic action of the molecules. Western blot analysis was performedwith 24 h incubation to examine the possible changes in the level of focaladhesion kinase (FAK), and both compounds were found to inhibit thephosphorylation of FAK in a concentration-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 cells.The results of this study demonstrate that C-3 and C-16 modified estradiolderivatives are potent antiproliferative and antimetastatic compounds against atriple-negative breast cancer cell line with a mechanism of action involving the inhibition of FAK, a novel anticancer therapeutic target. Therefore, thesefindings can be utilized in the development of promising anticancer agents withsteroid skeleton.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
