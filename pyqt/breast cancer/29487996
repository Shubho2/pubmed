Whilemore than 160 breast cancer risk loci have been identified in humans, geneticinteractions with estrogen exposure remain to be established. Strains of rodents exhibit striking differences in their responses to endogenous ovarian estrogens(primarily 17β-estradiol). Similar genetic variation has been observed forsynthetic estrogen agonists (ethinyl estradiol) and environmental chemicals that mimic the actions of estrogens (xenoestrogens). This review of literaturehighlights the extent of variation in responses to estrogens among strains ofrodents and compiles the genetic loci underlying pathogenic effects of excessive estrogen signaling. Genetic linkage studies have identified a total of the 35quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting responses to 17β-estradiol ordiethylstilbestrol in five different tissues. However, the QTL appear to act in atissue-specific manner with 9 QTL affecting the incidence or latency of mammarytumors induced by 17β-estradiol or diethylstilbestrol. Mammary gland development during puberty is also exquisitely sensitive to the actions of endogenousestrogens. Analysis of mammary ductal growth and branching in 43 strains ofinbred mice identified 20 QTL. Regions in the human genome orthologous to themammary development QTL harbor loci associated with breast cancer risk ormammographic density. The data demonstrate extensive genetic variation inregulation of estrogen signaling in rodent mammary tissues that alterssusceptibility to tumors. Genetic variants in these pathways may identify asubset of women who are especially sensitive to either endogenous estrogens orenvironmental xenoestrogens and render them at increased risk of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s00335-018-9741-z PMCID: PMC5936622PMID: 29487996
