Epub 2018Jun 13.Advances in the systemic treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.Lebert JM(1), Lester R(1), Powell E(1), Seal M(1), McCarthy J(1).Author information: (1)Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, NL.Triple-negative breast cancer constitutes a heterogeneous group of malignanciesthat are often aggressive and associated with a poor prognosis. Molecularcharacterization, while not a standard of care, can further subtypetriple-negative breast cancer and provide insight into prognostication andbehaviour. Optimal chemotherapy regimens have yet to be established; however,there have been advances in the systemic treatment of triple-negative breastcancer in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings. In this review, we discuss evidence for the potential benefit of neoadjuvant platinum-basedchemotherapy, adjuvant combination chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel, and BRCA mutation-directed therapy in the metastatic setting. The role for adjuvantcapecitabine in patients who do not achieve a pathologic complete response withneoadjuvant chemotherapy is reviewed. Future directions and data concerning noveltargeted agents are reviewed, including the most recent data on parp [poly(adp-ribose) polymerase] inhibitors, antiandrogen agents, and immunotherapy.DOI: 10.3747/co.25.3954 PMCID: PMC6001760PMID: 29910657
