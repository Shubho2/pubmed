Electronic address:ywang@Montefiore.org.Although recent technological advances, there is still discordance betweenmammography findings and pathologic diagnoses, especially for certainracial/ethnic populations. In this study we correlated the mammography BI-RADScategories with pathologic diagnoses, aiming to evaluate the performance ofmammography in breast cancer detection in a unique poor population consisting of mostly Hispanics and African Americans. A total of 3935 female patients with abreast mammography and a subsequent breast pathology report within 90 days wereretrospectively analyzed. There were 875 (22.2%) patients with a negative orprobably benign mammography (BI-RADS 1, 2 and 3), and 33 (3.8%) of them had amalignant pathologic diagnosis. Patients with malignant pathologic diagnoses wereolder, higher in socioeconomic status (SES), and more likely to be AfricanAmerican or White, compared to those with non-malignant pathologic findings. Theymostly presented with related symptoms (e.g. breast pain, mass or discharge)and/or family history or past history of breast cancers, which triggeredsecondary imaging examination and subsequent breast biopsy/excision, andeventually resulted to the diagnosis of breast cancers. In conclusion, ourstudies indicated that the performance of mammography is comparable in detection of breast cancers among Hispanics, African American and White populations, if it was done in the same facility. Our results also suggested that for patients with presenting symptoms, past history of breast cancer or strong family history ofbreast cancer, a secondary breast imaging examination may be warranted following a negative to probably benign mammography (BI-RADS 1-3).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
