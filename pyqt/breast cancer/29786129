Wesought to investigate factors associated with reoperations and variation inreoperation rates across breast surgeons at our cancer center.METHODS: Retrospective analyses of patients with clinical stage I-II breastcancer who underwent BCS between January and December 2014 were conducted priorto the recommendation of 'no ink on tumor' margin. Patient demographics and tumorand surgical data were extracted from medical records. A multivariate regression model was used to identify factors associated with reoperation.RESULTS: Overall, 490 patients with stage I (n  = 408) and stage II (n  = 89)breast cancer underwent BCS; seven patients had bilateral breast cancer andunderwent bilateral BCS procedures. Median invasive tumor size was 1.1 cm,reoperation rate was 22.9% (n  = 114) and varied among surgeons (range 15-40%),and, in 100 (88%) patients, the second procedure was re-excision, followed byunilateral mastectomy (n  = 7, 6%) and bilateral mastectomy (n  = 7, 6%).Intraoperative margin techniques (global cavity or targeted shaves) were utilizedin 50.1% of cases, while no specific margin technique was utilized in 49.9% ofcases. Median total specimen size was 65.8 cm3 (range 24.5-156.0). In theadjusted model, patients with multifocal disease were more likely to undergoreoperation [odds ratio (OR) 5.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.17-15.42]. Inaddition, two surgeons were found to have significantly higher reoperation rates (OR 6.41, 95% CI 1.94-21.22; OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.07-10.85).CONCLUSIONS: Examination of BCS demonstrated variability in reoperation rates andmargin practices among our breast surgeons. Future trials should look atsurgeon-specific factors that may predict for reoperations.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6526-2 PMID: 29786129
