Epub 2017 Dec 22.My burning issues in the neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer.Bergen ES(1)(2), Bartsch R(1)(2)(3).Author information: (1)Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vienna, Austria.(2)2Department of Medicine 1, Clinical Division of Oncology, Medical Universityof Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria.(3)3German Breast Group, Neu-Isenburg, Germany.A combination of anthracyclines and taxanes remains the standard of care forneoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) resulting in increased breast conservation rate(BCR) and decreased recurrence rate [1]. Whether pathological complete response(pCR) could be an appropriate surrogate parameter for long-term survival is stilla matter of debate. In patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) andHER2-positive breast cancer (BC), a six to nine times higher risk for relapse hasbeen reported if no pCR was achieved [2, 3]. Within these aggressive subtypes thestrongest association between pCR and long-term outcome could be observed [4].However, a pooled analysis of recently conducted trials could only identify pCRas a surrogate endpoint for improved event-free survival (EFS) and overallsurvival (OS) on an individual patient level as opposed to the trial level [5].Even in TNBC, demonstrating that an increased pCR converts into a significantsurvival benefit would require a study population markedly larger than calculatedfor previously conducted trials [6, 7].DOI: 10.1007/s12254-017-0378-5 PMCID: PMC5862920PMID: 29606978
