China.Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the critical component of polycomb groupprotein family, has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in various types ofhuman cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast, bladder and lungcancer. The mechanism of how EZH2 promotes oncogenesis has also been wellstudied. However, little is known about the role of EZH2 in colorectal cancer(CRC). The main purpose of the present study was to analyze the associationbetween EZH2 expression and the clinicopathological features of CRC. Therefore,the mRNA and protein expression levels were analyzed in tumor tissues andadjacent non-cancerous tissues by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerasechain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. The expression of EZH2 wasdemonstrated to be significantly increased in tumor tissues compared withadjacent noncancerous tissues, according to the results of western blot analysis and RT-qPCR in the majority of cases. Patients with low EZH2 expression had alonger overall survival rate compared with those with high EZH2 expression. Ananalysis of the association between clinicopathological features and EZH2expression indicated that high EZH2 expression was significantly associated with tumor stage, tumor size, histological differentiation and lymph node metastasis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high EZH2 expression was an independentpredictor of overall survival. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, thedata presented in the present study is the first to indicate that EZH2 isupregulated in CRC and may serve as a predictor of poor outcome for patients withCRC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7647 PMCID: PMC5778885PMID: 29435024
