Here, weprovide a whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (called RNA-seq) datasetconducted with ten samples of invasive ductal carcinoma tissue and three samples of adjacent normal tissue from a single Korean breast cancer patient (luminal Bsubtype). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with a falsediscovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value of 0.05. Gene ontology analysis identified several key pathways, including lymphocyte activation. A list of differentiallyexpressed genes is provided. The raw data was uploaded to the sequence readarchive (SRA) database and the BioProject ID is PRJNA432903.DOI: 10.1016/j.dib.2018.03.079 PMCID: PMC5996721PMID: 29900229
