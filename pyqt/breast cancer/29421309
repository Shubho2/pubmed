Electronic address:mgarmendia@inta.uchile.cl.(3)Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (INTA), Universidad de Chile, ElLíbano 5524, 7830490 Macul, Santiago, Chile.AIMS: We aimed to assess whether female offspring birth weight (BW) is associatedwith anthropometric and metabolic outcomes in Chilean mothers at 10-yearspostpartum.METHODS: We assessed data from 396 Chilean mother-daughter pairs participating inthe longitudinal Chilean Growth and Obesity Cohort (GOCS) and Determinants ofBreast Cancer Risk (DERCAM) studies. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were performed to associate female offspring BW with maternal Body MassIndex (BMI), waist circumference, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndromeand its components at 10-years postpartum.RESULTS: At 10-years postpartum, 69% of mothers were overweight, 65% had central adiposity and 26% had metabolic syndrome. Adjusted linear regression modelsshowed associations between female offspring BW and (1) maternal BMI (%ΔGM = 4.46; 95% CI 0.25-8.85); and (2) waist circumference (%Δ GM = 3.25; 95% CI0-6.60). Adjusted logistic regression models showed associations between femaleoffspring BW and (1) maternal metabolic syndrome (OR = 3.48; 95% CI 1.50-8.11);(2) central adiposity (OR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.08-5.22); and (3) hypertriglyceridemia(OR = 3.19; 95% CI 1.40-7.23).CONCLUSIONS: Female offspring BW was associated with maternal anthropometric and metabolic outcomes at 10-years postpartum. Our findings add to the emergingevidence that offspring BW might be a potential indicator for future maternalanthropometric and metabolic risks.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
