[Epub ahead of print]Role of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors in the current and future eras of cancer treatment.Parylo S(1), Vennepureddy A(2), Dhar V(1), Patibandla P(1), Sokoloff A(2).Author information: (1)1 Department of Internal Medicine, 7601 Staten Island University Hospital ,New York, USA.(2)2 Division of Hematology and Oncology, 7601 Staten Island University Hospital , New York, USA.Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors, which act by inhibiting progression from the G1 to S phases of the cell cycle, include palbociclib, ribociclib,abemaciclib, and trilaciclib. Palbociclib and ribociclib are currently food anddrug administration-approved for use in combination with aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women with metastatic hormone receptor-positive, human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer. Palbociclib is also food anddrug administration-approved for use in combination with fulvestrant in hormonereceptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breastcancer progressing after endocrine therapy. Abemaciclib is the newestcyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor to gain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, specifically as monotherapy for hormone receptor-positive, humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer previouslytreated with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Abemaciclib also shares asimilar indication with palbociclib for use in combination with fulvestrant inhormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negativebreast cancer progressing after endocrine therapy. Trilaciclib use remainslargely investigational at this time. However, despite FDA-approval for onlymetastatic hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor2-negative breast cancer, all four cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors haveshown promise in hematologic malignancies and non-breast solid tumors. Althoughfurther research is needed, cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors representintriguing developments in the treatment of various malignancies, including thosewith such poor prognoses as glioblastoma multiforme, mantle cell lymphoma, andmetastatic melanoma. We discuss the approved indications, current research, andareas of future exploration for palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib, andtrilaciclib.DOI: 10.1177/1078155218770904 PMID: 29726787
