However, the mechanism of anti-proliferative effects is currently unknown. Autophagy is non-apoptotic programmed cell death, which is characterizedby degradation of cytoplasmic components and as having a role in cancerpathogenesis.Aims: To investigate the anti-proliferative effects of atorvastatin on MCF-7human breast adenocarcinoma cells with respect to both autophagy and apoptosis.Study Design: Cell culture study.Methods: Cell viability was analyzed using WST-1 cell proliferation assay.Apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL method, whereas autophagy was assessed byBeclin-1 and LC3B immunofluorescence staining. Ultrastructural analysis of cells was performed by electron microscopy.Results: Atorvastatin reduced MCF-7 cell proliferation in a dose- andtime-dependent manner inducing TUNEL-, Beclin-1-, and LC3B-positive cells.Moreover, ultrastructural analysis showed apoptotic, autophagic, and necroticmorphological changes in treatment groups. A statistically significant increasein the apoptotic index was detected with higher concentrations of atorvastatin at24 h and 48 h (p<0.05).Conclusion: The anti-proliferative effects of atorvastatin on breast cancer cellsis mediated by the induction of both apoptosis and autophagy which shows statins as a potential treatment option for breast cancer.DOI: 10.4274/balkanmedj.2017.0604 PMCID: PMC5981123PMID: 29485098
