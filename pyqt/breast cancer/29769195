Here we examined the effect of two FDA-approveddopamine modulators, fluphenazine and trifluoperazine, on mammary tumor cells,osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. These agents suppressed proliferationand migration of mammary tumor cells chiefly by antagonizing dopamine receptor D2and reduced bone resorption by downregulating nuclear factor of activated Tcells, cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1). Three-dimensional spheroid formation assaysrevealed that tumor cells have high affinity to osteocytes and type I collagen,and interactions with osteocytes as well as administration of fluphenazine andtrifluoperazine downregulated Snail and suppressed migratory behaviors. Unlikethe inhibitory action of fluphenazine and trifluoperazine on tumor growth,tumor-osteocyte interactions stimulated tumor proliferation by upregulating NFκB and Akt. In the bone microenvironment, osteocytes downregulated Snail and actedas an attractant as well as a stimulant to mammary tumor cells. These resultsdemonstrate that tumor-osteocyte interactions strengthen dopaminereceptor-mediated suppression of tumor migration but weaken its inhibition oftumor proliferation in the osteocyte-rich bone microenvironment.Significance:These findings provide novel insight into the cellular cross-talk in the bonemicroevironment and the effects of dopamine modulators on mammary tumor cells andosteocytes.
