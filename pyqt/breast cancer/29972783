Soluble factors secreted by breast cancer cells trigger a cascade of events that stimulate osteoclast differentiation in the bone microenvironment.MacroH2A is a unique histone variant with a C-terminal non-histone domain andplays a crucial role in modulating chromatin organization and gene transcription.Here, we show that macroH2A1.2, one of the macroH2A isoforms, has an intrinsicability to inhibit breast cancer-derived osteoclastogenesis. This repressiveeffect requires macroH2A1.2-dependent attenuation of expression and secretion of lysyl oxidase (LOX) in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our mechanistic studies reveal that macroH2A1.2 physically and functionally interacts with the histonemethyltransferase EZH2 and elevates H3K27me3 levels to keep LOX gene in arepressed state. Collectively, this study unravels a role for macroH2A1.2 inregulating osteoclastogenic potential of breast cancer cells, suggestingpossibilities for developing therapeutic tools to treat osteolytic bonedestruction.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).
