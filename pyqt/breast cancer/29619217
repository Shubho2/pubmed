We also compared the mouse metabolomics data to published humanmetabolomics data already linked to clinical data.Results: Through analysis of our metabolomics data, we identified metabolicdifferences between normal and tumorÂ breast tissues as well as metabolicdifferences unique to each initiating oncogene. We also quantified the metabolic profiles of the mammary fat pad versus mammary epithelium by CZE-MS/MS. However, the differences between the tissues did not account for the majority of themetabolic differences between the normal mammary gland and breast tumor tissues. Therefore, the differences between the cohorts were unlikely due to cellularheterogeneity. Of the mouse models used in this study, C3-TAg was the only cohortwith a tumor metabolic signature composed of ten metabolites that had significantprognostic value in breast cancer patients. Gene expression analysis identifiedcandidate genes that may contribute to the metabolic reprogramming.Conclusions: This study identifies oncogene-induced metabolic reprogrammingwithin mouse breast tumors and compares the results to that of human breasttumors, providing a unique look at the relationship between and clinical value ofoncogene initiation and metabolism during breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s40170-018-0175-6 PMCID: PMC5881178PMID: 29619217
