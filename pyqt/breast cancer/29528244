Nanomedicine, particularly ligand-based nanoparticles have shown agreat potential for active targeting of tumor. Cell penetrating peptide is one ofthe promising ligands in a targeted cancer therapy. In this study, the gambogicacid-loaded nanostructured lipid carrier (GA-NLC) was modified with two kinds of cell penetrating peptides (cRGD and RGERPPR). The GA-NLC was prepared byemulsification and solvent evaporation method and coupled with cRGD, RGERPPR, andcombination cRGD and RGERPPR to form GA-NLC-cRGD, GA-NLC-RGE, andGA-NLC-cRGD/RGE, respectively. The formulations were characterized by theirparticle size and morphology, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, anddifferential scanning calorimetry. In vitro cytotoxicity and cellular uptakestudy of the formulations were performed against breast cancer cell (MDA-MB-231).Furthermore, in vivo biodistribution and antitumor activity of the formulationswere determined by in vivo imaging and in tumor-bearing nude mice, respectively. The result of in vitro cytotoxicity study showed that GA-NLC-RGE exhibited asignificantly higher cytotoxicity on MDA-MB-231 as compared with GA-NLC andGA-Sol. Similarly, RGE-Cou-6-NLC showed remarkably higher uptake by the cellsthan other NLCs over the incubation period. The in vivo imaging study hasdemonstrated that among the formulations, the RGE-decorated DiR-NLC were moreaccumulated in the tumor site. The in vivo antitumor activity revealed thatRGE-GA-NLC inhibits the tumor growth more efficiently than other formulations. Inconclusion, RGERPPR has a potential as an effective carrier in targeting drugdelivery of anticancer agents.DOI: 10.1080/10717544.2018.1446474 PMID: 29528244
