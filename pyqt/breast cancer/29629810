We investigate ifthe addition of tomosynthesis to mammography improves screening performanceoutcomes for women in this age group.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Screening performance for 59,921 patients (41,542 digital mammography and 18,379 tomosynthesis) younger than 50 years old was collectedfrom a community-based screening network from January 1, 2015, to December 31,2015. Patients were offered tomosynthesis if it was available. Parametersincluding recall, biopsy, and cancer detection rates were compared. Mixed effectsregression analysis was used to estimate rates with screening modality, age, and density as fixed effects and screening site as a random effect. Rates forpatients with dense breast tissue were also evaluated.RESULTS: Model adjusted rates per 1000 screenings with digital mammography werecompared with digital mammography plus tomosynthesis, respectively: recall ratedecreased from 117 to 108 (difference, -8.3; p = 0.003); biopsy rate increasedfrom 13.5 to 16.6 (difference, 3.1; p = 0.003); and cancer detection rateincreased from 1.9 to 2.6 (difference, 0.8; p = 0.060). Model adjusted rates for patients with dense breast tissue were: recall rate decreased from 135 to 132(difference, -3.2; p = 0.44); biopsy rate increased from 16.0 to 20.5(difference, 4.5; p = 0.004); and cancer detection rate increased from 2.1 to 3.5(difference, 1.3; p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: Tomosynthesis in a community setting resulted in decreased recallrates for patients younger than 50 years old. For the subgroup of women withdense breast tissue, cancer detection rates also increased.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.18839 PMID: 29629810
