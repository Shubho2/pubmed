Measures of genomic variation integrated with EHRs offer a potentialstrategy to accurately stratify patients for risk profiling and discover newrelationships between diagnoses and genomes. The objective of this study was toevaluate whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for common cancers are associatedwith multiple phenotypes in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) conductedin 28,260 unrelated, genotyped patients of recent European ancestry who consentedto participate in the Michigan Genomics Initiative, a longitudinal biorepository effort within Michigan Medicine. PRS for 12 cancer traits were calculated usingsummary statistics from the NHGRI-EBI catalog. A total of 1,711 syntheticcase-control studies was used for PheWAS analyses. There were 13,490 (47.7%)patients with at least one cancer diagnosis in this study sample. PRS exhibitedstrong association for several cancer traits they were designed for, includingfemale breast cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamouscell carcinoma, and thyroid cancer. Phenome-wide significant associations wereobserved between PRS and many non-cancer diagnoses. To differentiate PRSassociations driven by the primary trait from associations arising through sharedgenetic risk profiles, the idea of "exclusion PRS PheWAS" was introduced. Furtheranalysis of temporal order of the diagnoses improved our understanding of thesesecondary associations. This comprehensive PheWAS used PRS instead of a singlevariant.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics.
