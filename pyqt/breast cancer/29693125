China.Breast cancer (BC) is the leading malignancy in women worldwide, yet relativelylittle is known about the genes and signaling pathways involved in BCtumorigenesis and progression. The present study aimed to elucidate potential keycandidate genes and pathways in BC. Five gene expression profile data sets(GSE22035, GSE3744, GSE5764, GSE21422 and GSE26910) were downloaded from the GeneExpression Omnibus (GEO) database, which included data from 113 tumorous and38 adjacent non‑tumorous tissue samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs)were identified using t‑tests in the limma R package. These DEGs weresubsequently investigated by pathway enrichment analysis and a protein‑proteininteraction (PPI) network was constructed. The most significant module from thePPI network was selected for pathway enrichment analysis. In total, 227 DEGs wereidentified, of which 82 were upregulated and 145 were downregulated. Pathwayenrichment analysis results revealed that the upregulated DEGs were mainlyenriched in 'cell division', the 'proteinaceous extracellular matrix (ECM)', 'ECMstructural constituents' and 'ECM‑receptor interaction', whereas downregulatedgenes were mainly enriched in 'response to drugs', 'extracellular space','transcriptional activator activity' and the 'peroxisome proliferator‑activatedreceptor signaling pathway'. The PPI network contained 174 nodes and 1,257 edges.DNA topoisomerase 2‑a, baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat‑containingprotein 5, cyclin‑dependent kinase 1, G2/mitotic‑specific cyclin‑B1 andkinetochore protein NDC80 homolog were identified as the top 5 hub genes.Furthermore, the genes in the most significant module were predominantly involvedin 'mitotic nuclear division', 'mid‑body', 'protein binding' and 'cell cycle'. Inconclusion, the DEGs, relative pathways and hub genes identified in the presentstudy may aid in understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BCprogression and provide potential molecular targets and biomarkers for BC.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8895 PMCID: PMC5983982PMID: 29693125
