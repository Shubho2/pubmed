For studies on human breast cancer cellneovascularization, a new animal model was established to enable a moreconvenient study of tumor neovascularization.MAIN METHODS: A sodium alginate-gelatin blend gel system was used to design thenew animal model. The model was established using rabbit corneal pouchimplantation. Then, the animal model was validated by human breast cancer celllines MCF-7-Kindlin-2 and MCF-7-CMV.KEY FINDINGS: The experiment intuitively observed the relationship between tumor and neovascularization, and demonstrated the advantages of this animal model inthe study of tumor neovascularization.SIGNIFICANCE: The use of sodium alginate-gelatin blends to establish tumorneovascularization in a rabbit corneal pouch is a novel and ideal method for the study of neovascularization. It may be a better animal model for expanding theresearch in this area.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.lfs.2018.03.043 PMID: 29577878  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
