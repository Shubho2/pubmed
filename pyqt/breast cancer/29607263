Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. It accounts for one-fourth of all diagnosed cancers and affects one ineight females worldwide. Given the high BC prevalence, there is a practical need for demographic screening of the disease. In the present study, we re-analyzed a large microRNA (miRNA) expression dataset (GSE73002), with the goal of optimizingmiRNA biomarker selection using neural network cascade (NNC) modeling. Ourresults identified numerous candidate miRNA biomarkers that are technicallysuitable for BC detection. We combined three miRNAs (miR-1246, miR-6756-5p, andmiR-8073) into a single panel to generate an NNC model, which successfullydetected BC with 97.1% accuracy in an independent validation cohort comprising429 BC patients and 895 healthy controls. In contrast, at least seven miRNAs weremerged in a multiple linear regression model to obtain equivalent diagnosticperformance (96.4% accuracy in the independent validation set). Our findingssuggested that suitable modeling can effectively reduce the number of miRNAsrequired in a biomarker panel without compromising prediction accuracy, therebyincreasing the technical possibility of early detection of BC.DOI: 10.7717/peerj.4551 PMCID: PMC5875392PMID: 29607263
