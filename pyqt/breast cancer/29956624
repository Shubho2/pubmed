Portugal.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, also known as ABCG2) isgaining momentum as a key transporter that restricts the permeability of a large number of therapeutic agents through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BCRP ishighly expressed in the apical membranes of epithelial cells of the small andlarge intestine, renal proximal tubules and canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, determining the gastrointestinal absorption and biodisposition of its substrates.It is also expressed in the luminal surface of endothelial cells of the BBB andblood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), where it undoubtedly limits the entry of a widerange of therapeutics into the CNS, potentially contributing to the therapeuticfailure of CNS-acting drugs.METHOD: As the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European MedicinesAgency recommend pre-clinical evaluation and clinical assessment of BCRP-mediateddrug-drug interactions, compounds that are currently recognized as BCRPsubstrates, inhibitors or inducers will be addressed, focusing on theirpharmacokinetic behaviour in plasma and brain.RESULTS: Recent studies indicated a strong BCRP expression in themicrovasculature of the BBB in brain tumours, hypothesizing that this phenomenon critically influences the penetration of drugs in these tumours and potentiallycontribute to the failure of antitumor therapy. BCRP protein expression in brain tissue from patients or animal models of neurological and neurodegenerativediseases has also been investigated, and the role of BCRP and its implicationsfor novel therapeutic interventions was also be herein demonstrated.CONCLUSIONS: The clinical significance of BCRP in the disposition of drugs iscurrently undeniable.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1389200219666180629121033 PMID: 29956624
