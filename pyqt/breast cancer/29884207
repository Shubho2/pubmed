Recentlythere has been some evidence to suggest that an increased threshold based onvisual assessment could improve risk prediction. It is unknown, however, whether this also applies to volumetric density using digital raw mammograms.METHOD: Two case-control studies nested within a screening cohort (ages ofparticipants 46-73 years) from Manchester UK were used. In the first study (317cases and 947 controls) cases were detected at the first screen; whereas in thesecond study (318 cases and 935 controls), cases were diagnosed after the initialmammogram. Volpara software was used to estimate dense tissue height at eachpixel point, and from these, volumetric and area-based PD were computed at arange of thresholds. Volumetric and area-based PDs were evaluated usingconditional logistic regression, and their predictive ability was assessed using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and matched concordance index (mC).RESULTS: The best performing volumetric PD was based on a threshold of 5 mm ofdense tissue height (which we refer to as VPD5), and the best areal PD was at athreshold level of 6 mm (which we refer to as APD6), using pooled data and inboth studies separately. VPD5 showed a modest improvement in predictionperformance compared to the original volumetric PD by Volpara with ΔAIC = 5.90for the pooled data. APD6, on the other hand, shows much stronger evidence forbetter prediction performance, with ΔAIC = 14.52 for the pooled data, and mCincreased slightly from 0.567 to 0.577.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that imposing a 5 mm threshold on dense tissue height for volumetric PD could result in better prediction of cancer risk. There is stronger evidence that area-based density with a 6 mm threshold gives betterprediction than the original volumetric density metric.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0979-x PMCID: PMC5994123PMID: 29884207
