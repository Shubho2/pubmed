Clinical benefit rate (CBR; primary endpoint), time totreatment failure (TTF), overall survival (OS), and safety were evaluated.RESULTS: Of the 88 patients who were enrolled and received standard eribulintherapy in the first cycle, 42 patients were moved to the bi-weekly therapy groupand 40 continued standard therapy. In the bi-weekly and standard therapy groups, mean relative dose intensity was 62.7 and 90.9%, CBR was 31.0 and 25.0%, medianTTF was 81.5 and 75 days, and OS was 523 and 412 days, respectively. Neithergroup reported severe adverse events.CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show that a bi-weekly eribulin schedule istolerable and has comparable efficacy in patients intolerant to the standarderibulin schedule.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: University Hospital Medical Information Network(UMIN) Center (ID: UMIN 000008491).DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0843-y PMCID: PMC5996009PMID: 29435730
