Epub 2018 Feb 20.Checkpoint Inhibitors in Breast Cancer - Current Status and Future Directions.Bischoff J(1).Author information: (1)Center for Clinical Trials, St√§dtisches Klinikum Dessau, Dessau, Germany.Antineoplastic agents directly targeting tumor cells have represented the majorstrategy of systemic anticancer therapy for many years. Nevertheless, overcoming resistance mechanisms remains a great challenge because treatment options arelimited in many cases. From this point of view, immunotherapeutic approaches seempromising in a broad spectrum of solid tumors. These include in particular thecurrently available inhibitors directed against immune checkpoints leading to asignificant T-cell activation. To date, the programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)and its ligand are the most prominent targets in this context. However, the role of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer is still beingdebated, and the main focus is on triple-negative breast cancer patients as atarget population in many ongoing trials. Moreover, the potential superiority of combinations with other anticancer drugs such as cytotoxics and targeted agentswill be discussed.DOI: 10.1159/000486706 PMCID: PMC6016055 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29950964
