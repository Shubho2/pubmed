The southern region of Thailand isunique in that it is comprised of 30% Muslims, whereas the rest of Thailand is95% Buddhist. Breast cancer incidence and survival differ between these religiousgroups, but the association between clinical subtype of breast cancer andsurvival has not yet been assessed.METHODS: Here we characterized differences in breast cancer survival withconsideration to clinical subtype by religious group (Muslim Thai and BuddhistThai women). We compared distributions of age, stage and clinical subtype andassessed overall survival by religion.RESULTS: Our findings show that Muslim Thai women with breast cancer arediagnosed at a younger age, at later stages and have shorter overall survivaltimes compared to Buddhist Thai women with breast cancer. We also observe ahigher proportion of triple negative tumors characterized in Muslim Thai women.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm previous studies that have shown lower survivalrates in Muslim Thai women compared to Buddhist women with breast cancer andoffer novel information on subtype distribution. To date, this is the first studyassessing clinical subtypes in southern Thailand by religious status.IMPACT: Our findings are critical in providing information on the role ofclinical subtype in cancer disparities and provide evidence from the SoutheastAsian region for global studies on breast cancer survival.Copyright Â© 2018.
