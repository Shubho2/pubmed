This study was done to determine the power of combinedmammography and ultrasonography in differentiating N0-N1 from N2-N3 breastcancer.We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of 3944 female patients withinvasive breast cancer by preoperative mammography and ultrasonography betweenJanuary 2006 and December 2013 at our hospital. Pathological diagnosis wasavailable for each patient. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value(PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of mammography alone,ultrasonography alone, and combination of them for assessment of axillary lymphnode (ALN) status were calculated, using definitive histological results as thebaseline.The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy was 90.4%, 68.2%,36.5%, 97.2%, and 71.9% for ultrasonography; was 66.9%, 80.8%, 41.3%, 92.3%, and 78.4% for mammography; and was 94.9%, 62.4%, 33.8%, and 98.4% for combinedmammography and ultrasonography. For combination, accuracy and the area under thereceiver operating characteristic curve was 67.9% and 0.85, respectively.Inconclusion, combining ultrasonography and mammography improves the sensitivity indifferentiating N0-N1 breast cancer from N2-N3 breast cancer, but leading to areduced specificity. Addition of mammography to ultrasonography seems not toprovide significant benefits in predicting ALN status in breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011441 PMID: 30045266  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
