The adenoma, measuring 13 mm inheight by 10 mm in width, was discovered incidentally on imaging in 2012.Biochemical testing demonstrated a nonfunctioning adenoma. Given the relativelysmall lesion size and the lack of symptoms, observation was preferred oversurgical intervention. The patient was monitored with routine MRI, which until2016 demonstrated minimal growth. In early 2016, the patient developed recurrenceof metastatic breast cancer and was treated with palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor. This inhibitor acts on a pathway believed to beinvolved in pituitary adenoma tumorigenesis. One year after starting palbociclib,routine imaging demonstrated significant regression of her pituitary adenoma. Theauthors hypothesize that inhibition of the CDK4/6 pathway by palbociclibcontributed to adenoma regression in this patient, and that palbociclib mayrepresent a possible adjuvant therapy for the treatment of nonfunctioningpituitary adenomas.DOI: 10.3171/2018.2.FOCUS17660 PMID: 29852762
