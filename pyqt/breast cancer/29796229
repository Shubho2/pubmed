In this regard, ectopic expression of anti-metastaticmicroRNAs by miR-mimic and miR-restoration-based therapies could bring newinsights to the field. In the present study, the consequences of co-transfecting breast cancer cell lines with miR-193b and miR-31 were investigated via invasion and migration assays.Materials and Methods: Double stranded oligonucleotide of mature miR-193b-3p and miR-31-5p were cloned into pcDNA 6.2gw/EmGFP plasmid. The resulting plasmids wereused for transfection. Real time-PCR was performed to assess the expression ofmiR-193b and miR-31 as well as Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) andurokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) as miR targets. Scratch, Transwellmigration and Matrigel invasion assays were carried out to assess the extent ofmigration and invasion of cell lines.Results: The most significant increase in expression of miRs belonged to thesingle transfection of mimic-miRs in MDA-MB231. Although the co-transfection was not as successful as single transfection in miR expression, it was significantly more effective in inhibition of the cells invasive potential.Conclusion: Although the miR-restoration therapy based on co-transfection of two miRs could be less effective in expression of each miRNA, the resulting decrease in metastatic behavior of the cells is more significant due to collective effect of co-transfection to decrease target gene expression. Our results revealed that employing this sort of combinatorial strategies could lead to more efficientreduction in metastatic behavior. It seems that using this strategy would bringabout more successful therapeutic outcomes.DOI: 10.22038/IJBMS.2018.26614.6522 PMCID: PMC5960762PMID: 29796229
