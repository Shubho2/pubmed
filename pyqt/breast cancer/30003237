[Epub ahead of print]Surgeon Attitudes Toward the Omission of Axillary Dissection in Early BreastCancer.Morrow M(1), Jagsi R(2), McLeod MC(3), Shumway D(2), Katz SJ(4).Author information: (1)Breast Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,New York, New York.(2)Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.(3)Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.(4)Department of Health Management and Policy, School of Public Health,University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.Importance: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 study demonstrated the safety of sentinel node biopsy alone in clinically node-negativewomen with metastases in 1 or 2 sentinel nodes treated with breast conservation. Little is known about surgeon perspectives regarding when axillary lymph nodedissection (ALND) can be omitted.Objectives: To determine surgeon acceptance of ACOSOG Z0011 findings, identifycharacteristics associated with acceptance of ACOSOG Z0011 results, and examinethe association between acceptance of the Society of Surgical Oncology andAmerican Society for Radiation Oncology negative margin of no ink on tumor andsurgeon preference for ALND.Design, Setting, and Participants: A survey was sent to 488 surgeons treating apopulation-based sample of women with early-stage breast cancer (N = 5080). Thestudy was conducted from July 1, 2013, to August 31, 2015.Main Outcomes and Measures: Surgeons were categorized as having low,intermediate, or high propensity for ALND according to the outer quartiles ofALND scale distribution. A multivariable linear regression model was used toconfirm independent associations.Results: Of the 488 surgeons invited to participate, 376 (77.0%) responded and359 provided complete information regarding propensity for ALND derived from 5clinical scenarios. Mean surgeon age was 53.7 (range, 31-80) years; 277 (73.7%)were male; 142 (37.8%) treated 20 or fewer breast cancers annually and 108(28.7%) treated more than 50. One hundred seventy-five (49.0%) recommended ALNDfor 1 macrometastasis. Of low-propensity surgeons who recommended ALND, only 1(1.1%) approved ALND for any nodal metastases compared with 69 (38.6%) and 85(95.5%) of selective and high-propensity surgeons (P < .001), respectively. Inmultivariable analysis, lower ALND propensity was significantly associated withhigher breast cancer volume (21-50: -0.19; 95% CI, -0.39 to 0.02; >51: -0.48; 95%CI, -0.71 to -0.24; P < .001), recommendation of a minimal margin width (1-5 mm: -0.10; 95% CI, -0.43 to 0.22; no ink on tumor: -0.53; 95% CI, -0.82 to -0.24;P < .001), participation in a multidisciplinary tumor board (1%-9%: -0.25; 95%CI, -0.55 to 0.05; >9%: -0.37; 95% CI, -0.63 to -0.11; P = .02), and Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results site (-0.18; 95% CI, -0.35 to -0.01; P = .04).Conclusions and Relevance: This study shows substantial variation in surgeonacceptance of more limited surgery for breast cancer, which is associated withhigher breast cancer volume and multidisciplinary interactions, suggesting thepotential for overtreatment of many patients and the need for education targetinglower-volume breast surgeons.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1908 PMID: 30003237
