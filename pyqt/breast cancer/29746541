Working collaboratively, the two teams then designed a clinical platform that provides multiple breast careservices within a single visit. The service platform was implemented using abreast outreach camp format, during which breast self-awareness, psychosocialcounseling, clinical breast examination, breast ultrasound, ultrasound-guidedbiopsy, imprint cytology of biopsy specimens and surgical treatment or referral, were offered within a single visit.RESULTS: Eleven hundred and twenty-nine (1129) women attended the camps forbreast care. Mean age was 35.9 years. The majority were multiparous (79.4%),breast-fed (76.0%), and reported hormone use (50.4%). Abnormalities were detectedon clinical breast examination in 122 (10.8%) women, 114 of whom requiredultrasound. Of the 114 who underwent ultrasound, 48 had identifiable lesions and were evaluated with ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy (39) or fine-needleaspiration (9). The concordance between imprint cytology and histopathology was100%, when breast specimens were classified as either benign or malignant.However, when specimens were classified by histopathologic subtype, theconcordance between imprint cytology and histology was 85.7% for benign and 100% for malignant lesions. Six (6) women were diagnosed with invasive cancer.Eighteen (18) women with symptomatic breast lesions had next-day surgery.SIGNIFICANCE: Similar to its impact on cervical cancer prevention services, asingle visit breast care algorithm has the potential to overcome healthsystem-related barriers to timely diagnosis of breast diseases, including cancer,in rural African settings.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196985 PMCID: PMC5945023PMID: 29746541  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
