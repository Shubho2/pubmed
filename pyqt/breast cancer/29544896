In addition to its classic functions, recent studies haveindicated that Aurora-A is critical for controlling self-renewal of embryonicstem cells through negative regulation of p53. Additionally, aberrant expression of Aurora-A contributes to oncogenic transformation and induces stem cell-likeproperties in estrogen receptor α-positive breast cancer cells. Silencing ofAurora-A has been implicated in elimination of leukemia stem cells in vivo.Therefore, Aurora-A is an attractive target for cancer therapeutics and a growingnumber of small molecule inhibitors of Aurora-A have been developed. In thepresent review, we will address the role of Aurora-A in cancer stem cells, aswell as the outcomes of clinical trials assessing Aurora-A-specific smallmolecular inhibitors.Copyright © 2018.
