Epub2018 Apr 26.Vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide and 5-FU effects on the circulating andintratumoural landscape of immune cells improve anti-PD-L1 efficacy inpreclinical models of breast cancer and lymphoma.Orecchioni S(1), Talarico G(1), Labanca V(1), Calleri A(2), Mancuso P(1),Bertolini F(3).Author information: (1)Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology and Hemo-Lympho Pathology Unit, EuropeanInstitute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.(2)Hemo-Lympho Pathology Unit, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.(3)Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology and Hemo-Lympho Pathology Unit, EuropeanInstitute of Oncology, Milan, Italy. francesco.bertolini@ieo.it.BACKGROUND: Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors (CIs) are clinicallyactive in many types of cancer. However, only a minority of patients achieve acomplete and/or long-lasting clinical response. We studied the effects ofdifferent doses of three widely used, orally active chemotherapeutics(vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide and 5-FU) over local and metastatic tumour growth,and the landscape of circulating and tumour-infiltrating immune cells involved inCI activity.METHODS: Immunocompetent Balb/c mice were used to generate models of breastcancer (BC) and B-cell lymphoma. Vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide and 5-FU (alone orin combination with CIs), were given at low-dose metronomic, medium, or maximumtolerable dosages.RESULTS: Cyclophosphamide increased circulating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide and 5-FU reduced circulating APCs.Vinorelbine and cyclophosphamide (at medium/high doses) reduced circulatingTregs. Cyclophosphamide (at low doses) and 5-FU (at medium doses) slightlyincreased circulating Tregs. Cyclophosphamide was the most potent drug inreducing circulating CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+ T cells. Vinorelbine, cyclophosphamideand 5-FU reduced the number of circulating B cells, with cyclophosphamide showingthe most potent effect. Vinorelbine reduced circulating NKs, whereascyclophosphamide and 5-FU, at low doses, increased circulating NKs. In spite ofreduced circulating T, B and NK effector cells, preclinical synergy was observed between chemotherapeutics and anti-PD-L1. Most-effective combinatorial regimenswhere associated with neoplastic lesions enriched in B cells, and, in BC-bearing mice (but not in mice with lymphoma) also in NK cells.CONCLUSIONS: Vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide and 5-FU have significant preclinical effects on circulating and tumour-infiltrating immune cells and can be used toobtain synergy with anti-PD-L1.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0076-z PMID: 29695766
