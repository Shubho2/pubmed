Highexpression of LC3, a residual autophagy marker, in primary breast tumors has beenassociated with metastatic disease and poor outcome. FIP200/Atg17, amulti-functional pro-survival molecule required for autophagy, has beenimplicated in brain metastases in experimental models. However, expression ofthese proteins has not been examined in brain metastases from patients withbreast cancer.METHODS: In this retrospective study, specimens from 44 patients with brainmetastases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast (IDC), unpaired samplesfrom 52 patients with primary IDC (primary-BC) and 16 matched-paired samples wereanalyzed for LC3 puncta, expression of FIP200/Atg17, and p62 staining.RESULTS: LC3-puncta+ tumor cells and FIP200/Atg17 expression were detected ingreater than 90% of brain metastases but there were considerable intra- andinter-tumor differences in expression levels. High numbers of LC3-puncta+ tumorcells in brain metastases correlated with a significantly shorter survival timein triple-negative breast cancer. FIP200/Atg17 protein levels were significantly higher in metastases that subsequently recurred following therapy. Thepercentages of LC3 puncta+ tumor cells and FIP200/Atg17 protein expressionlevels, but not mRNA levels, were significantly higher in metastases thanprimary-BC. Meta-analysis of gene expression datasets revealed a significantcorrelation between higher FIP200(RB1CC1)/Atg17 mRNA levels in primary-BC tumors and shorter disease-free survival.CONCLUSIONS: These results support assessments of precision medicine-guidedtargeting of autophagy in treatment of brain metastases in breast cancerpatients.DOI: 10.1007/s11060-018-2959-5 PMID: 30094720
