Treating of 2a,b with hydrazine derivatives in acetic acid or propionic acid afforded pyrazoline derivatives, 3a⁻f and 4a⁻f, respectively.Furthermore, results proved the superiority of thienyl derivatives over4-bromophenol derivatives in terms of cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cancer cells. Invivo xenograft breast cancer animal model experiments revealed that thesynthesized derivatives can be used for decreasing tumor volume, while the mostpotent derivative (4f) decreased the development of tumor volume by about 87.0%after 12 days.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23071572 PMID: 29958453
