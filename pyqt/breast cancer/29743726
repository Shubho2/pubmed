Vladimir.katanaev@unil.ch.Wnt signaling is important for breast development and remodeling during pregnancyand lactation. Epigenetic modifications change expression levels of components ofthe Wnt pathway, underlying oncogenic transformation. However, no clear Wntcomponent increasing expression universally across breast cancer (BC) or its mostWnt-dependent triple-negative BC (TNBC) subgroup has been identified, delayingdevelopment of targeted therapies. Here we perform network correlation analysisof expression of >100 Wnt pathway components in hundreds of healthy and cancerousbreast tissues. Varying in expression levels among people, Wnt componentsremarkably coordinate their production; this coordination is dramaticallydecreased in BC. Clusters with coordinated gene expression exist within thehealthy cohort, highlighting Wnt signaling subtypes. Different BC subgroups areidentified, characterized by different remaining Wnt signaling signatures,providing the rational for patient stratification for personalizing thetherapeutic applications. Key pairwise interactions within the Wnt pathway (some inherited and some established de novo) emerge as targets for future drugdiscovery against BC.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25672-6 PMCID: PMC5943245PMID: 29743726
