Based on elemental analysis, 1 : 2 (M : L) molarratio was suggested for all inspected complexes. 1H, 13C NMR, mass, UV-Vis, TGA, and IR were the spectral tools used for describing the formulae. Moreover, XRDpatterns and SEM pictures were used to evaluate the particle sizes which appearedstrongly in nanometer range. CT-DNA study is the major consideration in thisstudy, to test the interacting ability of all synthesized cationic complexestowards cell DNA. Each binding constant was computed and correlated with theHammett sigma constant. Antitumor activity was examined upon three carcinoma celllines (MCF-7, HepG2, and HCT116). The high efficiency was recorded towards MCF-7 (breast carcinoma) cell line. Kinetic studies yield essential parameters toassert on the rule of metal atom on thermal feature of organic compounds.Molecular modeling was implemented to optimize the structures of compounds. Also,molecular docking was achieved to obtain a clear view about proposed drugbehavior within the affected cells. This was achieved through comparing thecalculated internal energy values of all docking complexes. All the testedcompounds displayed a significant interaction with breast cancer protein (strong matching with practical result) followed by DNA polymerase protein.DOI: 10.1155/2018/2727619 PMCID: PMC5976992PMID: 29861710
