In this study, we aimed to examine therelationship between the expression of APOBEC3B and the effect of neoadjuvantchemotherapy (NAC) using pretreatment biopsy tissue, and examined whether theexpression of APOBEC3B influenced chemotherapy efficacy.Methods: We retrospectively selected a total of 274 patients with primary breast cancer who received NAC in more than 4 courses and underwent surgery at ourinstitute. We assessed the expression of APOBEC3B mRNA using pretreatment biopsy specimens of NAC by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and examined therelationship between APOBEC3B mRNA expression and sensitivity to chemotherapyusing pathological complete response (pCR) as an indicator. Further, we assessed the prognostic value of APOBEC3B in the patients receiving NAC.Results: APOBEC3B mRNA expression levels were successfully assessed in 173(63.1%) of the 274 specimens. The total pCR rate was 36.4% (n = 63). Anassociation between APOBEC3B expression levels and pCR was observed (Wilcoxontest, P ≤ 0.0001). The patients were divided into two groups, low (n = 66) andhigh (n = 107), according to the APOBEC3B expression levels, using the cut-offvalue calculated by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for pCR.The rate of pCR was significantly higher among the patients in the high groupthan among those in the low group (47.7% vs 18.2%, P ≤ 0.0001). High APOBEC3Bexpression was significantly associated with high nuclear grade (P = 0.0078),high Ki-67 labeling index (P = 0.0087), estrogen receptor (ER) negativity (P ≤0.0001) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negativity (P =0.032). Tumor size (P = 0.011), ER (P ≤ 0.0001), HER2 (P = 0.0013) and APOBEC3Bexpression (P = 0.037) were independent predictive factors for pCR inmultivariate analysis. However, there was no association between APOBEC3Bexpression and prognosis.Conclusions: Our study showed that APOBEC3B mRNA expression correlated withsensitivity to NAC in breast cancer patients. In contrast to previous studies,APOBEC3B mRNA expression was not associated with breast cancer prognosis inpatients receiving NAC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25495 PMCID: PMC6078135PMID: 30093965
