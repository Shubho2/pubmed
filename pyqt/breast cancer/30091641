[Epub aheadof print]WDR62 mediates TNFα dependent JNK activation via TRAF2-MLK3 axis.Prinz E(1), Aviram S(1), Aronheim A(1).Author information: (1)Department of Cell Biology and Cancer Science, B. Rappaport Faculty ofMedicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa Israel.The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulate a variety of cellularprocesses. The three main MAPK cascades are the ERK, JNK and p38 kinases. Atypical MAPK cascade is composed of MAP3K-MAP2K-MAPK kinases that are held byscaffold proteins. Scaffolds function to assemble the protein tier and contributeto the specificity and efficacy of signal transmission. WDR62 is a JNK scaffoldprotein, interacting with JNK, MKK7 and several MAP3Ks. The loss of WDR62 inhuman leadsto microcephaly and pachygyria. Yet, the role of WDR62 in cellularfunction is not fully studied. We used the Crispr/Cas9 and ShRNA approaches toestablish a human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with WDR62 loss of function and studied the consequence to JNK signaling. In growing cells, WDR62 isresponsible for the basal expression of c-Jun. In stressed cells, WDR62specifically mediates TNFα-dependent JNK activation through the association with both the adaptor protein, TRAF2, and the MAP3K protein, MLK3. TNFα dependent JNK activation is mediated by WDR62 in HCT116 and HeLa cell lines as well. MDA-MB-231WDR62-KO cells display increased resistance to TNFα-induced cell death.Collectively, WDR62 coordinates the TNFα receptor signaling pathway to JNKactivation through association with multiple kinases and the adaptor proteinTRAF2.DOI: 10.1091/mbc.E17-08-0504 PMID: 30091641
