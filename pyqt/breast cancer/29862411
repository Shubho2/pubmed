Safety was asecondary objective. No formal statistical comparisons were planned.Results: A total of 309 postmenopausal women were enrolled, median age, 61 years (range, 32-88 years). Of these, 104 received everolimus plus exemestane; 103,everolimus alone; and 102, capecitabine alone. Median follow-up fromrandomization to the analysis cutoff (June 1, 2017) was 37.6 months. Estimated HRof PFS was 0.74 (90% CI, 0.57-0.97) for the primary objective of everolimus plus exemestane vs everolimus alone and 1.26 (90% CI, 0.96-1.66) for everolimus plusexemestane vs capecitabine alone. Between treatment arms, potential informativecensoring was noted, and a stratified multivariate Cox regression model was used to account for imbalances in baseline characteristics; a consistent HR wasobserved for everolimus plus exemestane vs everolimus (0.73; 90% CI, 0.56-0.97), but the HR was closer to 1 for everolimus plus exemestane vs capecitabine (1.15; 90% CI, 0.86-1.52). Grade 3 to 4 adverse events were more frequent withcapecitabine (74%; n = 75) vs everolimus plus exemestane (70%; n = 73) oreverolimus alone (59%; n = 61). Serious adverse events were more frequent witheverolimus plus exemestane (36%; n = 37) vs everolimus alone (29%; n = 30) orcapecitabine (29%; n = 30).Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that everolimus plus exemestanecombination therapy offers a PFS benefit vs everolimus alone, and they supportcontinued use of this therapy in this setting. A numerical PFS difference withcapecitabine vs everolimus plus exemestane should be interpreted cautiously owingto imbalances among baseline characteristics and potential informative censoring.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01783444.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.2262 PMID: 29862411
