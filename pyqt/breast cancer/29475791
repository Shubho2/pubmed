Previous systematicreviews have identified risk factors for breast cancer-related lymphedema,including increased BMI, number of lymph nodes dissected and radiotherapy.However, they have not examined the effect of breast reconstruction on lymphedemaoccurrence. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to evaluatethe association between breast reconstruction (BR) and lymphedema.METHODS: We searched PubMed (1966-2016), Embase (1966-2016), Scopus (2004-2016)and Google Scholar (2004-2016) for studies involving breast reconstruction andupper-extremity lymphedema or breast cancer-related lymphedema. Our primaryoutcome was lymphedema occurrence. We performed a meta-analysis using randomeffects due to heterogeneity of the studies.RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 934 articles. After screening, 19 studieswere included in our meta-analysis evaluating outcomes based on number ofpatients (7501) or number of breasts surgically treated (2063). Breastreconstruction was significantly associated with lower odds of lymphedema(p < 0.001) compared to mastectomy only or breast-conserving surgery. Lymphedema rates were not statistically significantly different between patients undergoing implant-based or autologous BR.CONCLUSIONS: Breast reconstruction is associated with lower rates of lymphedemacompared to mastectomy only or breast conserving surgery patients. Although thestudy does not prove causation, we hypothesize that this association is likelydue to multiple factors, including a self-selecting population and mechanismsthrough which BR may contribute to primary or secondary prevention of lymphedema.Further prospective studies are needed to clarify this beneficial relationshipbetween breast reconstruction and reduced lymphedema risk.Copyright © 2018.
