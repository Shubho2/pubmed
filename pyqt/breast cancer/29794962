Here, we validated neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) as apotential therapeutic target in gastric cancer. We compared NTSR1 expressionlevels in sixty different gastric cancer-tissue samples and cells, as well as in other cancer cells (lung, breast, pancreatic, and colon), by assessing NTSR1expression via semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chainreaction, immunocytochemistry and western blot. Following neurotensin (NT)treatment, we analyzed the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and further determined the effects on cell migration and invasion viawound-healing and transwell assays. Our results revealed that NTSR1 mRNA levelswere higher in gastric cancer tissues than non-cancerous tissues. Both of NTSR1mRNA levels and expression were higher in gastric cancer cell lines relative tolevels observed in other cancer-cell lines. Moreover, NT treatment induced MMP-9 expression and activity in all cancer cell lines, which was significantlydecreased following treatment with the NTSR1 antagonist SR48692 orsmall-interfering RNA targeting NTSR1. Furthermore, NT-mediated metastases wasconfirmed by observing epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers SNAIL andE-cadherin in gastric cancer cells. NT-mediated invasion and migration of gastriccancer cells were reduced by NTSR1 depletion through the Erk signaling. Thesefindings strongly suggested that NTR1 constitutes a potential therapeutic target for the inhibition of gastric cancer invasion and metastasis.DOI: 10.14348/molcells.2018.0025 PMCID: PMC6030244PMID: 29794962
