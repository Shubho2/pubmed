Recently, we have witnessed greatmomentum in the field of immuno-oncology. Checkpoint inhibitors and chimericantigen receptor T cell therapy have now entered the clinic, with impressive and durable clinical responses seen across a broad array of tumor types. There areseveral lines of evidence supporting the development of an immune targetedapproach in breast cancer. Emerging data of early clinical trials evaluatingmonotherapy checkpoint inhibition have shown modest activity in breast cancer, inparticular high grade and aggressive subtypes such as triple negative, humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and luminal B breast cancers. A considerable amount of effort is currently underway in exploring the use ofcombinatory strategies where therapies with distinct and potentiallycomplementary mechanisms of actions may further enhance the immune responsebroadening out the group of breast cancer patients who would benefit from thisstrategy of cancer treatment. In this review, we discuss approaches to targeting the immune system in breast cancer adopted through understanding why the hostimmune system has failed in natural tumor suppression as well as the processesevolved by the tumor to circumvent an active immune system.DOI: 10.21037/cco.2018.04.01 PMID: 29764158
