Multiple primary malignancy has been increasingly reported over the past decade, and double primary cancer is considered as the most common type.Â  In this study, we present a 53-year-old woman with synchronous primary malignancy of breast and endometrium. This patient had a history of breast and endometrial cancer in herfamily. Mammography and chest CT of the patient revealed a mass in the rightbreast and left supraclavicular region. However, the patient did not want toinitiate treatment. Subsequently, the patient returned with a chief complaint of persistent abnormal vaginal bleeding. Abdominopelvic CT scan of the patientrevealed a huge soft tissue mass in the pelvic cavity. She underwenthysterectomy, and pathology revealed endometrioid carcinoma, which had invadedthe full thickness of uterine wall. Since this type of malignancy is rare andseveral risk factors are associated with it, it is worth being considered byclinicians when making decisions about screening or strategy for prevention.DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.11971.3 PMCID: PMC5754747.3PMID: 29333235
