We investigated associations between urine concentrations ofa panel of elements and breast density.METHODS: Mammographic density categories were abstracted from radiology reportsof 725 women aged 40-65Â yr in the Avon Army of Women. A panel of 27 elements was quantified in urine using high resolution magnetic sector inductively coupledplasma mass spectrometry. We applied LASSO (least absolute shrinkage andselection operator) logistic regression to the 27 elements and calculated oddsratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dense vs. nondense breasts,adjusting for potential confounders.RESULTS: Of the 27 elements, only magnesium (Mg) was selected into the optimalregression model. The odds ratio for dense breasts associated with doubling theMg concentration was 1.24 (95% CI 1.03-1.49). Doubling the calcium-to-magnesiumratio was inversely associated with dense breasts (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98).CONCLUSIONS: Our cross-sectional study found that higher levels of urinarymagnesium were associated with greater breast density. Prospective studies areneeded to confirm whether magnesium as evaluated in urine is prospectivelyassociated with breast density and, more importantly, breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/01635581.2018.1446094 PMID: 29537902
