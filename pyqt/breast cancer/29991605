Manav_Korpal@h3biomedicine.com.Mutations in estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) that confer resistance to existingclasses of endocrine therapies are detected in up to 30% of patients who haverelapsed during endocrine treatments. Since a significant proportion oftherapy-resistant breast cancer metastases continue to be dependent on ERasignaling, there remains a critical need to develop the next generation of ERaantagonists that can overcome aberrant ERa activity. Through our drug discoveryefforts, we identified H3B-5942 which covalently inactivates both wild-type andmutant ERa by targeting Cys530 and enforcing a unique antagonist conformation.H3B-5942 belongs to a class of ERa antagonist referred to as Selective EstrogenReceptor Covalent Antagonists (SERCAs). In vitro comparisons of H3B-5942 withstandard of care (SoC) and experimental agents confirmed increased antagonistactivity across a panel of ERa(WT) and ERa(MUT) cell lines. In vivo, H3B-5942demonstrated significant single-agent antitumor activity in xenograft modelsrepresenting ERa(WT) and ERa(Y537S) breast cancer that was superior tofulvestrant. Lastly, H3B-5942 potency can be further improved in combination withCDK4/6 or mTOR inhibitors in both ERa(WT) and ERa(MUT) cell lines and/or tumormodels. In summary, H3B-5942 belongs to a class of orally available ERa covalent antagonists with an improved profile over SoCs.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-17-1229 PMID: 29991605
