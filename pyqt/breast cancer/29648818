Their structures were fully characterized by spectroscopic methods. Structurally, 1 possesses an unusual skeleton featuringimidazole and oxazolone rings linked via a nitrogen atom, whereas 2 bears anintriguing guanylurea-substituted imidazole ring. Compounds 4 and 5 wereidentified as zinc complexes; they represent the metal complex analogues ofnaamidine J (6) and pyronaamidine (7), respectively. Among the isolatedcompounds, 2 and 5 showed significant inhibitory activities toward theLPS-induced production of IL-6 in the human acute monocytic leukemia cell lineTHP-1, and 7 displayed cytotoxicity against MCF-7, PC9, A549, and breast cancerstem cells (MCF-7-Oct4-GFP) with IC50 values of 5.2, 5.6, 7.8, and 10 Î¼M,respectively.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b01006 PMID: 29648818
