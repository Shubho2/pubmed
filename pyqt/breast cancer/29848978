In order to determine the influence of the length of the alkyl chain between theplatinum(II) center and the ASA moiety, compounds with varying methylene groups(n = 1⁻4) were synthesized and characterized. For the propene derivativestructural elucidation by X-ray crystallography was possible. Prior to evaluationof biological activity, the complexes were investigated regarding their stabilityin different media, such as water, physiological sodium chloride, and phosphatebuffered saline. Therefore, an analytical method based on capillaryelectrophoresis was established. All of the compounds were tested for their COXinhibitory potential. In general, complexes with longer alkyl chains causedhigher inhibition of COX enzymes and the inhibitory potential towards COX enzymeswas enhanced when compared to Zeise's salt. The growth inhibitory effects of the synthesized substances were investigated in vitro against colon carcinoma (HT-29)and breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. The IC50 values of the new derivatives rangedfrom 30 to 50 µM, whereas neither Zeise's salt itself nor ASA showed anyantiproliferative activity at the used concentrations.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19061612 PMCID: PMC6032411PMID: 29848978
