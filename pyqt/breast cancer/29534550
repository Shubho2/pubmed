Patient-derivedtumor xenograft (PDX) model is a cutting-edge approach for drug research onbreast cancer. However, PDX still exhibits differences from original humantumors, thereby challenging the molecular understanding of tumorigenesis. Inparticular, gene expression changes after tissues are transplanted from human to mouse model. In this study, we propose a novel computational method byincorporating several machine learning algorithms, including Monte Carlo feature selection (MCFS), random forest (RF), and rough set-based rule learning, toidentify genes with significant expression differences between PDX and originalhuman tumors. First, 831 breast tumors, including 657 PDX and 174 human tumors,were collected. Based on MCFS and RF, 32 genes were then identified to beinformative for the prediction of PDX and human tumors and can be used toconstruct a prediction model. The prediction model exhibits a Matthewscoefficient correlation value of 0.777. Seven interpretable interactions withinthe informative gene were detected based on the rough set-based rule learning.Furthermore, the seven interpretable interactions can be well supported byprevious experimental studies. Our study not only presents a method foridentifying informative genes with differential expression but also providesinsights into the mechanism through which gene expression changes after beingtransplanted from human tumor into mouse model. This work would be helpful forresearch and drug development for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3390/genes9030155 PMCID: PMC5867876PMID: 29534550
