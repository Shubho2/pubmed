Electronic address: jmarchal@ugr.es.Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumor initiation, metastasis andcancer recurrence, however the involvement of microenvironment is crucial. Here, we have analyzed how human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived conditionedmedium (CM) affect colon and melanoma CSCs enrichment and maintenance. Ourresults strongly suggest that the secretome of CM-MSCs selects and maintainssubpopulations with high expression of CSCs markers and ALDH1 activity, lowproliferation rates with G1 phase arrest, and notably retain in vivo theseproperties. Cytogenetic analyses indicated that CM-cultured cells containalterations in chromosome 17 (17q25). Subsequent SKY-FISH analyses suggested thatgenes located in 17q25 might be involved in stem-cell maintenance. Thecharacterization of secreted proteins present in CM-MSCs revealed that fourcytokines and seven growth factors are directly linked to the CSCs enrichmentreported in this study. Further analyses revealed that the combination of justIL6 and HGF is enough to provide cancer cells with better stemness properties. Inconclusion, this study demonstrates how specific chromosomal alterations present in CSCs subpopulations might represent an advantage for their in vitromaintenance and in vivo stemness properties.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
