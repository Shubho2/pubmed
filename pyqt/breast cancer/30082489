[Epub ahead of print]Pretreatment 18F-FDG Uptake Heterogeneity Predicts Treatment Outcome ofFirst-Line Chemotherapy in Patients with Metastatic Triple-Negative BreastCancer.Gong C(1)(2), Ma G(3)(2)(4)(5), Hu X(1)(2), Zhang Y(3)(2)(4)(5), Wang Z(1)(2),Zhang J(1)(2), Zhao Y(1)(2), Li Y(1)(2), Xie Y(1)(2), Yang Z(6)(2)(4)(5), WangB(7)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center,Shanghai, People's Republic of China.(2)Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.(3)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center,Shanghai, People's Republic of China.(4)Center for Biomedical Imaging, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republicof China.(5)Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging Probes, Shanghai,People's Republic of China.(6)Department of Nuclear Medicine, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center,Shanghai, People's Republic of China yangzhongyi21@163.com pro_wangbiyun@163.com.(7)Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center,Shanghai, People's Republic of China yangzhongyi21@163.com pro_wangbiyun@163.com.BACKGROUND: Intratumoral heterogeneity of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptakein primary tumor has proven to be a surrogate marker for predicting treatmentoutcome in various tumors. However, the value of intraindividual heterogeneity inmetastatic diseases remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluatepretreatment positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)18F-FDG-based heterogeneity for the prediction of first-line treatment outcome inmetastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: mTNBC patients from three clinical trials (NCT00601159,NCT01287624, and NCT02341911) with whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT scan beforefirst-line gemcitabine/platinum were included. Heterogeneity index (HI) and themaximum of FDG uptake (MAX) across total metastatic lesions (-T) on baselinePET/CT scans were assessed. HI was measured by MAX divided by the minimum FDGuptake across metastatic lesions. Optimal cutoffs were determined bytime-dependent receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. Progression-freesurvival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methodand compared by log-rank test.RESULTS: A total of 42 mTNBC patients were included in this study. The median PFSof patients with high HI-T (>1.9) and high MAX-T (>10.5) was significantlyshorter than patients with low HI-T (<1.9; p = .049) and low MAX-T (<10.5; p =.001). In terms of OS, only high MAX-T was significant for poorer outcome (p =.013). ROC curve analysis confirmed the predictive value of MAX and HI in mTNBCpatients. Area under the ROC curve for MAX-T and HI-T was 0.75 and 0.65,indicating a higher predictive accuracy than conventional clinical risk factors.CONCLUSION: HI and MAX measured among metastatic lesions on pretreatment 18F-FDG PET/CT scans could be potential predicators for first-line treatment outcome inpatients with mTNBC.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Intratumoral heterogeneity of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) uptake in primary tumor has proven to be a robust surrogate predictivemarker. A novel positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)parameter-heterogeneity index (HI) to quantify the heterogeneous characteristics of metastatic disease is proposed. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is ahighly heterogeneous disease and remains a clinical challenge. The predictiveperformance of HI, along with the maximum FDG uptake (MAX), measured onpretreatment PET/CT scans in patients with metastatic TNBC was evaluated. Resultsindicate that HI and MAX may serve as applicable imaging predicators fortreatment outcome of metastatic TNBC in clinical practice.Â© AlphaMed Press 2018.DOI: 10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0001 PMID: 30082489
