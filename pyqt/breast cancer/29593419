Multiplemechanisms responsible for drug resistance have been elucidated, and miRNAs seem to play a major part in almost every aspect of cancer progression, includingtumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. In recent years, exosomes haveemerged as novel modes of intercellular signaling vehicles, initiating cell-cell communication through their fusion with target cell membranes, deliveringfunctional molecules including miRNAs and proteins. This review particularlyfocuses on enumerating functional miRNAs involved in breast cancer drugresistance as well as their targets and related mechanisms. Subsequently, wediscuss the prospects and challenges of miRNA function in drug resistance andhighlight valuable approaches for the investigation of the role of exosomalmiRNAs in breast cancer progression and drug resistance.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S152462 PMCID: PMC5865556PMID: 29593419
