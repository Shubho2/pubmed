Populationdifferences can lead to biased results by classical indirect treatment comparison(ITC). Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) aims to correct thesedifferences. We compared RIBO and PALBO in hormone receptor-positive/humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer using MAIC.Methods: Patient-level data were available for RIBO (MONALEESA-2), while onlypublished summary data were available for PALBO (PALOMA-2). Weights were assignedto MONALEESA-2 patient data such that mean baseline characteristics matched thosereported for PALOMA-2; the resulting matched cohort was used in comparisons.Limited by the results reported in PALOMA-2, progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary comparison. Cox regression models were used to calculate adjustedhazard ratios (HRs) for PFS, before indirect treatment comparison (ITC) wasperformed with 95% confidence intervals. An exploratory analysis was performedsimilarly for overall survival using earlier PALBO data (PALOMA-1). Grade 3/4adverse events were also compared.Results: Racial characteristics, prior chemotherapy setting, and the extent ofmetastasis were the most imbalanced baseline characteristics. The unadjusted PFS HRs were 0.556 (0.429, 0.721) for RIBO+LET versus LET alone and 0.580 (0.460,0.720) for PALBO+LET versus LET alone. MAIC adjustment resulted in an HR of 0.524(0.406, 0.676) for RIBO+LET versus LET. PFS ITC using unadjusted trial dataproduced an HR of 0.959 (0.681, 1.350) for RIBO versus PALBO, or 0.904 (0.644,1.268) with MAIC. Unadjusted overall survival HR of RIBO versus PALBO was 0.918(0.492, 1.710); while exploratory MAIC was 0.839 (0.440, 1.598). ITC of grade 3/4adverse events yielded a risk ratio of 0.806 (0.604, 1.076).Conclusion: MAIC was performed for RIBO and PALBO in the absence of ahead-to-head trial: though not statistically significant, the results favoredRIBO.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S163478 PMCID: PMC5968783PMID: 29861642
