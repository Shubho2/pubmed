Finding ways to early initiate and maintain such behavioramong youth is therefore important. In this study we aimed to determine theeffects of two health promotion education interventions on knowledge and attitudeto breast care, as well as practice of BSE and physical activity by femalecollege students. Materials and Methods: A total of 999 students from tencolleges underwent two kinds of health education strategies for three months,namely the traditional health education program (THEP) and tapping peer leadersusing mobile phone prompts (PPHEP). Results: Improvement in knowledge andattitude was shown for both groups as compared to the control group. Bothinterventions equally increased the practice of BSE and maintenance of therecommended level of physical activity. Conclusion: There was an increase in the knowledge and positive attitude to breast care and practice of BSE with animprovement in the level of exercise when THEP and PPHEP interventions were used.Health education with peers using mobile phone prompts offers an alternative and effective way of promoting BSE and acceptable levels of exercise.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.5.1201 PMCID: PMC6031841PMID: 29801402
