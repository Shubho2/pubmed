Some miRNAs, including let-7a andmiR-195, have been described as tumor suppressors. However, the roles of thesemicroRNAs in breast cancer progression remain controversial. The aim of thisstudy is to evaluate miR-195 and let-7a expression as potential biomarkers ofinvasive breast cancer.METHODS: In the present study, 200 individuals were separated into three groups: (i) 72 women constituting the control group who were selected according torigorous and well-established criteria; (ii) 56 patients with benign breasttumors; and (iii) 72 patients with malignant breast cancers of different clinicalstages. The miR-195 and let-7a expression levels in serum were evaluated byreal-time PCR. The results were assessed alone and in combination, and theanalysis included an estimation of sensitivity and specificity in ROC curves.RESULTS: Compared with the benign and control groups, both microRNAs weredownregulated in the malignant breast cancer patient group. Compared with themalignant group, the combination of both biomarkers in the control and benigngroups showed good sensitivity and specificity in the serum with AUCs of 0.75 and0.72, respectively. The biomarker combination for the control group versus themalignant group exhibited a better sensitivity and specificity than for thebenign group versus the malignant group.CONCLUSION: These findings support the evidence that the analysis of miR-195 and let-7a can be used as a non-invasive biomarker for breast cancer detection.DOI: 10.6061/clinics/2018/e184 PMCID: PMC6024513PMID: 29995098
