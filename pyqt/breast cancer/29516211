However, institutions are limited due to radioactivity in the RI method. The greatest advantage of the RI method is that it objectively assessesRI uptake as a numerical value. The aim of the present study was to verify theusefulness of ICG fluorescence intensity in SN.METHODS: Seventeen patients with early gastric cancer were enrolled in thisstudy. RI uptake by each lymph node was measured using Navigator GPS andfluorescence nodes were identified using the hyper eye medical system (HEMS).Fluorescence intensity in fluorescence nodes was evaluated using ICG intensityimaging software (Mizuho, Japan) of the HEMS.RESULTS: The total number of dissected lymph nodes was 227, with an average of13.3 per patient. The numbers of HN, FN-S, and FN-B were 64, 77, and 34. RIuptake was significantly greater by FN-S than by non-FN-S (P = 0.0016). Themedian fluorescence intensity value was higher in HN than in non-HN (P < 0.001). A correlation was observed between RI uptake and fluorescence intensity.Dissecting FNs with fluorescence intensity levels of 1-6 resulted in 92.1%dissection of HNs.CONCLUSION: It is possible that the evaluation of fluorescence intensity isuseful for selected SNs instead of RI tracer. If fluorescence intensity ismeasurable in surgery, an infrared fluorescence method using ICG may be usefuland safe for the detection of SN in early gastric cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10120-018-0816-z PMID: 29516211
