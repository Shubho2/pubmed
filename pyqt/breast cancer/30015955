China.Ultrasound scanning has widespread used in clinical practice and also hastherapeutic applications. Simvastatin is a statins that is able to competitively inhibit the activity of 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl‑coenzyme A reductase. The aim of the present study was to investigate the roles and mechanisms of low‑frequencyultrasound (LFU) and microbubbles combined with simvastatin on MCF‑7 cell growth and apoptosis. Cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated using anMTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of related proteinswas measured by western blot assay. The results revealed that simvastatin and LFUwith microbubbles reduces the viability of MCF‑7 cells. The combination of LFUand microbubbles with simvastatin promoted the apoptosis of MCF‑7 cells.Furthermore, it was confirmed that LFU and microbubbles combined with simvastatinaffected the large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1)/yes‑associated protein(YAP)/receptor of the hyaluronan‑mediated motility (RHAMM) pathway in MCF‑7cells. It was determined that LATS1 acts as a negative regulator in theLATS1/YAP/RHAMM pathway in MCF‑7 cells. In conclusion, the results of the presentstudy indicate that LFU and microbubbles combined with simvastatin promotes theapoptosis of MCF‑7 cells via the LATS1/YAP/RHAMM pathway. The present studysuggested a possible strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9273 PMID: 30015955
