The identificationrates, the number of SLNs identified, and the disease-free survival (DFS) betweenthe two mapping methods were compared.RESULTS: The identification rate of SLNs was significantly higher with thecombined method than that with the blue dye alone method (99.2% vs 93.3%,respectively; P < 0.001). The average number of SLNs identified per patient inthe combined method group was 3.7 ± 2.4, which was more than that in the blue dyealone group (3.2 ± 1.6; P = 0.004). With a median follow-up of 29 months, 0.5%patients in the combined group, and 1.3% patients in the blue dye group hadaxillary recurrences. The DFS between the two groups showed no significantdifference (P = 0.161).CONCLUSION: The combined method achieved a higher identification rate and lowerrate of axillary recurrence compared to the blue dye alone method.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jso.25058 PMID: 29790178
