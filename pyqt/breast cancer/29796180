In this study, we developed an 18-geneclassifier (18-GC) to predict distant recurrence of breast cancer and compared itwith the 21-gene panel (Oncotype DXÂ®, ODx) in performance. Included were 224breast cancer patients with positive hormonal receptor (HR+) and negative humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-). We compared the demographic,clinical, and survival information of the patients, and further compared theprediction of recurrence risk obtained by using the 18-GC with that by ODx. Tohave the best combined sensitivity and specificity, receiver operatingcharacteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cutoff valuesfor several breakpoint scores. For the new 18-GC, a breakpoint score of 21 wasadopted to produce a combined highest sensitivity (95%) and specificity (39%) in detecting distant recurrence. At this breakpoint score, 164 of the 224 patientswere classified by the 18-GC in the same risk level as by ODx, giving aconcordance rate of 73%. Along with patient age and tumor stage, this 18-GC wasfound to be an independent significant prognostic factor of distant metastasis ofbreast cancer. We have thus created a new gene panel assay for prediction ofdistant recurrence in HR+ and HER2- breast cancer patients. With a highconcordance rate with ODx, this new assay may serve as a good tool for individualbreast cancer patients to make an informed decision on whether adjuvantchemotherapy should be performed post-surgery.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25258 PMCID: PMC5955427PMID: 29796180
