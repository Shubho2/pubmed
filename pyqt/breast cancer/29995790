However, its prognostic value inpatients with breast cancer is not well established still now. In thismeta-analysis, we evaluated the prognostic role of cfDNA in breast cancerpatients.METHODS: We performed systematic searches in electronic databases to identifystudies that evaluated the prognostic value of cfDNA in breast cancer patients.The end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).The hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) wereextracted to assess the prognostic significance of cfDNA. Subgroup analyses were also conducted.RESULTS: A total of 11 publications involving 1467 patients were included in thismeta-analysis. cfDNA was shown to be significantly associated with PFS (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.51-2.72, P < .001, I = 82%) and OS (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.01-3.05, P < .001,I = 92%). The results of subgroup analyses also revealed that cfDNA was a goodpredictor of prognosis in breast cancer patients.CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicated that cfDNA was associated with poor PFSand OS, thus it may help to predict outcomes of patients with breast cancer.However, further studies are needed to confirm our results.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011417 PMID: 29995790  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
