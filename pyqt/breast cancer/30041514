This study was carriedout to design an anti-Mucin 1 aptamer (Apt)-conjugated chitosan nanoparticle (NP)for targeted co-delivery of insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) siRNA and docetaxel (DTX) to SKBR3 cells.Methods: Characterization of nano-drugs, cellular uptake of NPs, cell viability, and gene expression studies were evaluated based on metastatic breast cancercells.Results: The results of this study showed that NPs had spherical and smoothmorphology with 110-118 nm in size and had positive zeta potential (12-14 mV).siRNA and DTX were considerably loaded into NPs. The appropriate conjugation ofthe Apt to the NPs was affirmed by gel electrophoresis. The Apt-conjugated NPswere observed to enhance the cellular uptake of NPs into the SKBR3 cells.Although the combination treatment significantly decreased the cell viability of SKBR3 cells, the augmentative effect was observed when Apt was conjugated to NPs.Furthermore, Apt-conjugated NPs dramatically reduced the genetic expression ofIGF-1R, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), matrixmetalloproteinases (MMP9), and vascular growth factor (VEGF).Conclusion: The targeted NPs may augment the targeting of pathways involved intumorigenesis and metastasis of breast cancer. Therefore, more animal modelexperiments are needed to further clarify the efficacy and safety of thisfunctionalized nanodrug.PMID: 30041514
