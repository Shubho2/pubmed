We investigated the clinical significance of CD4, forkhead box P3(FOXP3), and B cell attracting chemokine leukocyte chemoattractant-ligand (C-X-C motif) 13 (CXCL13) in early breast cancer.METHODS: The study is based on the patient population of the randomized FinHertrial, where 1010 patients with early breast cancer were randomly allocated toadjuvant chemotherapy containing either docetaxel or vinorelbine, and humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive patients were also allocatedto trastuzumab or no trastuzumab. Breast cancer CD4, FOXP3, and CXCL13 contentswere evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and their influence on distant disease-free survival (DDFS) was examined usingunivariable and multivariable Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier estimates in theentire cohort and in selected molecular subgroups. Interactions between variableswere analyzed using Cox regression. The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)subset of the HE10/97 randomized trial was used for confirmation.RESULTS: High CXCL13 was associated with favorable DDFS in univariable analysis, and independently in multivariable analysis (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29-0.67, P≤ 0.001), most strongly in TNBC (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.79, P = 0.009). Nosignificant interaction with chemotherapy or trastuzumab administration wasdetected. Neither tumor CD4 content nor FOXP3 content was associated with DDFS.The favorable prognostic influence of CXCL13 was confirmed in the HE10/97 trialpatient population with TNBC (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09-0.93; P = 0.038).CONCLUSIONS: The results provide a high level of evidence that humoral immunityinfluences the survival outcomes of patients with early breast cancer, inparticular of those with TNBC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study reports retrospective biomarker analyses in theprospective FinHer trial and the prospective HE10/97 trial.
