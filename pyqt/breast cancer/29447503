While exposure to ERα agonists suchas 17β-estradiol (E2) is related to proliferation, RAR agonists such as all-transretinoic acid (AtRA) induce anti-proliferative effects. Although crosstalkbetween these pathways has been proposed, the molecular mechanisms underlyingthis interplay are still not completely unraveled. The aim of this study was toevaluate the effects of AtRA on ERα-mediated signaling in the ERα positive celllines MCF7/BUS and U2OS-ERα-Luc to investigate some of the possible underlyingmodes of action. To do so, this study assessed the effects of AtRA on differentERα-related events such as ERα-mediated cell proliferation and gene expression,ERα-coregulator binding and ERα subcellular localization. AtRA-mediatedantagonism of E2-induced signaling was observed in the proliferation and geneexpression studies. However, AtRA showed no remarkable effects on the E2-drivencoregulator binding and subcellular distribution of ERα. Interestingly, in theabsence of E2, ERα-mediated gene expression, ERα-coregulator binding and ERαsubcellular mobilization were increased upon exposure to micromolarconcentrations of AtRA found to inhibit cell proliferation after long-termexposure. Nevertheless, experiments using purified ERα showed that direct bindingof AtRA to ERα does not occur. Altogether, our results using MCF7/BUS andU2OS-ERα-Luc cells suggest that AtRA, without being a direct ligand of ERα, canindirectly interfere on basal ERα-coregulator binding and basal ERα subcellularlocalization in addition to the previously described crosstalk mechanisms such ascompetition of ERs and RARs for DNA binding sites.DOI: 10.1080/10799893.2018.1436559 PMID: 29447503
