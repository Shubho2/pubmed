This creates demand for a more effective diagnostic means to replace or be complementary toexisting technologies for early discovery of breast cancer. Cancer neoantigenscould reflect tumorigenesis, but they are hardly detectable at the early stage.Autoantibodies, however, are biologically amplified and hence may be measurableearly on, making them promising biomarkers to discriminate breast cancer fromhealthy tissue accurately. In this review, we summarized the recent findings ofbreast cancer specific antigens and autoantibodies, which may be useful in early detection, disease stratification, and monitoring of treatment responses ofbreast cancer.DOI: 10.3390/bios8030067 PMID: 30011807
