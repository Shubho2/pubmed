Physician experience of diagnosingand detecting breast cancer can be assisted by using some computerized featuresextraction and classification algorithms. This paper presents the conduction and results of a systematic review (SR) that aims to investigate the state of the artregarding the computer aided diagnosis/detection (CAD) systems for breast cancer.METHODS: The SR was conducted using a comprehensive selection of scientificdatabases as reference sources, allowing access to diverse publications in thefield. The scientific databases used are Springer Link (SL), Science Direct (SD),IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and PubMed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria weredefined and applied to each retrieved work to select those of interest. From 320 studies retrieved, 154 studies were included. However, the scope of this researchis limited to scientific and academic works and excludes commercial interests.RESULTS: This survey provides a general analysis of the current status of CADsystems according to the used image modalities and the machine learning basedclassifiers. Potential research studies have been discussed to create a moreobjective and efficient CAD systems.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.cmpb.2017.12.012 PMID: 29428074
