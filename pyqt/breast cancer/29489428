Breast cancer treatment delays of as little as 2 months are associated with adverse outcomes. Methods We used a controlled prepost design with survival analysis to assess timing of breastcancer care events among 273,499 women age 25 to 64 years without evidence ofbreast cancer before inclusion. Women were included if continuously enrolled for 1 year in a low-deductible ($0 to $500) plan followed by up to 4 years in a HDHP (at least $1,000 deductible) after an employer-mandated switch. Study inclusionwas on a rolling basis, and members were followed between 2003 and 2012. Thecomparison group comprised 2.4 million contemporaneously matched women whoseemployers offered only low-deductible plans. Measures were times to firstdiagnostic breast imaging (diagnostic mammogram, breast ultrasound, or breastmagnetic resonance imaging), breast biopsy, incident early-stage breast cancerdiagnosis, and breast cancer chemotherapy. Outcomes were analyzed by using Coxmodels and adjusted for age-group, morbidity score, poverty level, US region,index date, and employer size. Results After the index date, HDHP membersexperienced delays in receipt of diagnostic imaging (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR],0.95; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.96), biopsy (aHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89 to 0.95),early-stage breast cancer diagnosis (aHR, 0.83; 0.78 to 0.90), and chemotherapyinitiation (aHR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.86) compared with the control group.Conclusion Women switched to HDHPs experienced delays in diagnostic breastimaging, breast biopsy, early-stage breast cancer diagnosis, and chemotherapyinitiation. Additional research should determine whether such delays causeadverse health outcomes, and policymakers should consider selectively reducingout-of-pocket costs for key breast cancer services.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.75.2501 PMCID: PMC5891127 [Available on 2019-04-10]PMID: 29489428
