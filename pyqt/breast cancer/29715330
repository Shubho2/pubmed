Thebiomimetic film (i) was obtained by electro-polymerizing amine-substitutedbenzene rings around a CA 15-3 target. This protein target was previouslyadsorbed on a gold (Au) support and incubated in charged monomers(4-Styrenesulfonate sodium and 3-Hydroxytyraminium chloride). The protein wasfurther eliminated by enzymatic activity, leaving behind vacant sites forsubsequent rebinding. Electrochemical detection (ii) was achieved on an Auworking electrode, designed on commercial screen-printed electrodes. Ramanspectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and ellipsometric readings were used tofollow the chemical modification of the Au surface. The ability of the materialto rebind CA15-3 was monitored by electrochemical techniques. The devicedisplayed linear responses to CA15-3 ranging from 0.25 to 10.00 U/mL, withdetection limits of 0.05 U/mL. Accurate results were obtained by applying thesensor to the analysis of CA15-3 in PBS buffer and in serum samples. Thisbiosensing device displayed successful features for the detection of CA 15-3 and constitutes a promising tool for breast cancer screening procedures inpoint-of-care applications. Moreover, its scale-up seems feasible as it contains a plastic antibody assembled in situ, in less than 1 minute, and the analysis of serum takes less than 30 minutes.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196656 PMCID: PMC5929556PMID: 29715330  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
