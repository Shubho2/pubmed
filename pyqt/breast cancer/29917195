Haibozheng86@sina.com.OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of microRNA-1266 (miR-1266) on metastasis andgrowth in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells and to provide therapeutic targetsfor papillary thyroid carcinoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: By quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), miR-1266 expression level in 38 pairs of papillary thyroid carcinoma tissues and three breast cancer-derived cell lines was examined. After transfection withmiR-1266 mimics, the effects of miR-1266 over-expression on cell proliferation,invasion and migration were analyzed. Further, we employed several databases for the target gene prediction. Dual-luciferase activity assay was performed toverify whether FGFR2 was the direct target gene of miR-1266. Western blotting wasconducted to detect protein levels.RESULTS: MiR-1266 was significantly downregulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma tissue samples and cell lines. Over-expression of miR-1266 in papillary thyroidcarcinoma cells significantly attenuated the cell proliferation, invasion, andmigration. Dual-luciferase report assay and Western blotting confirmed that FGFR2was a target gene of miR-1266. Furthermore, up-regulation of FGFR2 partiallyreversed the suppressive effects of miR-1266 over-expression on cell growth andprogression.CONCLUSIONS: miR-1266 could inhibit cell proliferation and progression ofpapillary thyroid carcinoma via targeting FGFR2. Our findings might provide a newtarget for the diagnosis and treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma.PMID: 29917195
