Histologic grade is one of the strongestprognostic factors in breast cancer (BC). This study aims at investigating theagreement between BC grading using traditional light microscopy (LM) and digital WSI with consideration of reproducibility and impact on outcome prediction.METHODS: A large (n=1675) well-characterised cohort of BC originally graded by LMwas re-graded using WSI. Two separate virtual-based grading sessions (V1 and V2) were performed with a 3-month washout period. Outcome was assessed usingBC-specific and distant metastasis-free survival.RESULTS: The concordance between LM grading and WSI was strong (LM/WSI Cramer'sV: V1=0.576, and V2=0.579). The agreement regarding grade components was asfollows: tubule formation=0.538, pleomorphism=0.422 and mitosis=0.514. Greatestdiscordance was observed between adjacent grades, whereas high/low gradediscordance was uncommon (1.5%). The intraobserver agreement for the two WSIsessions was substantial for grade (V1/V2 Cramer's V=0.676; kappa=0.648) andgrade components (Cramer's V T=0.628, p=0.573 and M=0.580). Grading using bothplatforms showed strong association with outcome (all p values <0.001). Although mitotic scores assessed using both platforms were strongly associated withoutcome, WSI tends to underestimate mitotic counts.CONCLUSIONS: Virtual microscopy is a reliable and reproducible method forassessing BC histologic grade. Regardless of the observer or assessment platform,histologic grade is a significant predictor of outcome. Continuing advances inimaging technology could potentially provide improved performance of WSI BCgrading and in particular mitotic count assessment.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
