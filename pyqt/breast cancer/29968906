Tumor relapse and metastasis areprimary factors contributing to breast cancer-related deaths. Therefore, thechallenge for breast cancer treatment is to sustain remission. A driving forcebehind tumor relapse is breast cancer heterogeneity (both intertumor, betweendifferent patients, and intratumor, within the same tumor). Understanding breast cancer heterogeneity is necessary to develop preventive interventions andtargeted therapies. A recently emerging concept is that intratumor heterogeneity is driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are capable of giving rise to amultitude of different cells within a tumor. Studies have highlighted linkage of CSC formation with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this review, wesummarize the current understanding of breast cancer heterogeneity, links betweenEMT and CSCs, regulation of EMT by Runx transcription factors, and potentialtherapeutic strategies targeting these processes.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26847 PMID: 29968906
