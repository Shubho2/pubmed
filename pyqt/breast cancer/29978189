Mammography screeningreduces death from breast cancer at the cost of overdiagnosis. Identifyingrisk-stratified screening strategies with a more favorable ratio of overdiagnosesto breast cancer deaths prevented would improve the quality of life of women and save resources.Objective: To assess the benefit-to-harm ratio and the cost-effectiveness ofrisk-stratified breast screening programs compared with a standard age-basedscreening program and no screening.Design, Setting, and Population: A life-table model was created of a hypotheticalcohort of 364 500 women in the United Kingdom, aged 50 years, with follow-up toage 85 years, using (1) findings of the Independent UK Panel on Breast CancerScreening and (2) risk distribution based on polygenic risk profile. The analysiswas undertaken from the National Health Service perspective.Interventions: The modeled interventions were (1) no screening, (2) age-basedscreening (mammography screening every 3 years from age 50 to 69 years), and (3) risk-stratified screening (a proportion of women aged 50 years with a risk score greater than a threshold risk were offered screening every 3 years until age 69years) considering each percentile of the risk distribution. All analyses tookplace between July 2016 and September 2017.Main Outcomes and Measures: Overdiagnoses, breast cancer deaths averted,quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, costs in British pounds, and netmonetary benefit (NMB). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to assessuncertainty around parameter estimates. Future costs and benefits were discountedat 3.5% per year.Results: The risk-stratified analysis of this life-table model included ahypothetical cohort of 364 500 women followed up from age 50 to 85 years. As the risk threshold was lowered, the incremental cost of the program increasedlinearly, compared with no screening, with no additional QALYs gained below 35th percentile risk threshold. Of the 3 screening scenarios, the risk-stratifiedscenario with risk threshold at the 70th percentile had the highest NMB, at awillingness to pay of £20 000 (US $26 800) per QALY gained, with a 72%probability of being cost-effective. Compared with age-based screening,risk-stratified screening at the 32nd percentile vs 70th percentile riskthreshold would cost £20 066 (US $26 888) vs £537 985 (US $720 900) less, wouldhave 26.7% vs 71.4% fewer overdiagnoses, and would avert 2.9% vs 9.6% fewerbreast cancer deaths, respectively.Conclusions and Relevance: Not offering breast cancer screening to women at lowerrisk could improve the cost-effectiveness of the screening program, reduceoverdiagnosis, and maintain the benefits of screening.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1901 PMID: 29978189
