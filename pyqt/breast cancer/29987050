We have identified C-terminal SRC kinase (CSK) as a critical node in apreviously unappreciated negative feedback loop that limits the efficacy ofcurrent ER-targeted therapies. Estrogen directly drives CSK expression in ER+breast cancer. At low CSK levels, as is the case in patients with ER+ breastcancer resistant to endocrine therapy and with the poorest outcomes, the p21protein-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) becomes activated and drivesestrogen-independent growth. PAK2 overexpression is also associated withendocrine therapy resistance and worse clinical outcome, and the combination of aPAK2 inhibitor with an ER antagonist synergistically suppressed breast tumorgrowth. Clinical approaches to endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer mustovercome the loss of this estrogen-induced negative feedback loop that normallyconstrains the growth of ER+ tumors.Copyright Â© 2018 the Author(s).
