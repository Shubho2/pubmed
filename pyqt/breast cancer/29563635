Epub 2018Mar 22.In breast cancer subtypes steroid sulfatase (STS) is associated with lessaggressive tumour characteristics.McNamara KM(1), Guestini F(2), Sauer T(3)(4), Touma J(4)(5), Bukholm IR(5),Lindstrøm JC(4)(6), Sasano H(2), Geisler J(4)(7).Author information: (1)Department of Anatomic Pathology, School of Graduate Medicine, TohokuUniversity Japan, Sendai, Japan. kmcnamara@patholo2.med.tohoku.ac.jp.(2)Department of Anatomic Pathology, School of Graduate Medicine, TohokuUniversity Japan, Sendai, Japan.(3)Department of Pathology, Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway.(4)Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.(5)Department of Breast- and Endocrine Surgery, Akershus University Hospital,Lørenskog, Norway.(6)Helse Sør-Øst Health Services Research Centre, Akershus University Hospital,Lørenskog, Norway.(7)Department of Oncology, Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway.BACKGROUND: The majority of breast cancer cases are steroid dependent neoplasms, with hormonal manipulation of either CYP19/aromatase or oestrogen receptor alpha axis being the most common therapy. Alternate pathways of steroid actions aredocumented, but their interconnections and correlations to BC subtypes andclinical outcome could be further explored.METHODS: We evaluated selected steroid receptors (Androgen Receptor, OestrogenReceptor alpha and Beta, Glucocorticoid Receptor) and oestrogen pathways (steroidsulfatase (STS), 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (17βHSD2) and aromatase) in acohort of 139 BC cases from Norway. Using logistic and cox regression analysis,we examined interactions between these and clinical outcomes such as distantmetastasis, local relapse and survival.RESULTS: Our principal finding is an impact of STS expression on the risk fordistant metastasis (p<0.001) and local relapses (p <0.001), HER2 subtype(p<0.015), and survival (p<0.001). The suggestion of a beneficial effect ofalternative oestrogen synthesis pathways was strengthened by inverted, butnon-significant findings for 17βHSD2.CONCLUSIONS: Increased intratumoural metabolism of oestrogens through STS isassociated with significantly lower incidence of relapse and/or distantmetastasis and correspondingly improved prognosis. The enrichment of STS in theHER2 overexpressing subtype is intriguing, especially given the possible role of HER-2 over-expression in endocrine resistance.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0034-9 PMID: 29563635
