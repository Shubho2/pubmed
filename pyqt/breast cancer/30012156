To date, only few data exist on real-time measured intra-fraction motion in breast cancer patients. Continuous surface imaging using visible light offers the capability tomonitor patient movements in three-dimensional space without any additionalradiation exposure. The aim of the present study was to quantify theuncertainties of possible intra-fractional motion during breast radiotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and four consecutive patients that underwentpostoperative radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery or mastectomy wereprospectively evaluated during 2028 treatment sessions. During each treatmentsession the patients' motion was continuously measured using the Catalyst™optical surface scanner (C-RAD AB, Sweden) and compared to a reference scanacquired at the beginning of each session. The Catalyst system works through anoptical surface imaging with light emitting diode (LED) light and reprojectioncaptured by a charge coupled device (CCD) camera, which provide target positioncontrol during treatment delivery with a motion detection accuracy of 0.5 mm. For3D surface reconstruction, the system uses a non-rigid body algorithm tocalculate the distance between the surface and the isocentre and using theprinciple of optical triangulation. Three-dimensional deviations and relativeposition differences during the whole treatment fraction were calculated by thesystem and analyzed statistically.RESULTS: Overall, the maximum magnitude of the deviation vector showed a meanchange of 1.93 mm ± 1.14 mm (standard deviation [SD]) (95%-confidence interval:[0.48-4.65] mm) and a median change of 1.63 mm during dose application (beam-ontime only). Along the lateral and longitudinal axis changes were quite similar(0.18 mm ± 1.06 mm vs. 0.17 mm ± 1.32 mm), on the vertical axis the mean changewas 0.68 mm ± 1.53 mm. The mean treatment session time was 154 ± 53 (SD) seconds and the mean beam-on time only was 55 ± 16 s. According to Friedman's testdifferences in the distributions of the three possible directions (lateral,longitudinal and vertical) were significant (p < 0.01), in post-hoc analysisthere were no similarities between any two of the three directions.CONCLUSION: The optical surface imaging system is an accurate and easy tool forreal-time motion management in breast cancer radiotherapy. Intra-fraction motion was reported within five millimeters in all directions. Thus, intra-fractionmotion in our series of 2028 treatment sessions seems to be of minor clinicalrelevance in postoperative radiotherapy of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-1072-4 PMCID: PMC6048710PMID: 30012156
