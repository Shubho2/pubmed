However, whether a membrane protein can serve notonly as a tumor marker that reflects TEAD function but also as a therapeutictarget that stimulates tumorigenesis in HCC remains unknown.METHODS: Tissue NRP1 was measured using immunohistochemistry. Cell viability,colony formation and caspase3/7 activity were assessed using MTT, soft agar andcaspase 3/7 Glo assays, respectively. Serum NRP1 was examined using ELISA andWestern blotting.RESULTS: NRP1 expression was up-regulated by TEAD. We also identified a conservedTEAD-binding motif in the NRP1 promoters, which was essential for the TEAD-NRP1interaction. NRP1 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and knockdown ofNRP1 inhibited the transformative phenotypes of HCC cells. Notably, theconcentrations of serum NRP1 in the HCC patients were much higher than those ofhepatitis B, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer and lung cancer patients. Moreover, serum NRP1 was significantly associated with AFP, γ-GT, Alb, bile acid, ALT, AST, ALP and pre-Alb. The area under the receiveroperating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for serum NRP1 was 0.971, presentingbetter diagnostic performance compared to AFP.CONCLUSIONS: NRP1 is a novel tumor marker in HCC.Copyright © 2018.
