The majorityof endometrial cancers can be cured by surgery alone or in combination withadjuvant chemo- or radiotherapy; however, a subset of patients experiencerecurrence for reasons that remain unclear. Recurrence is associated withchemoresistance to carboplatin and paclitaxel and consequentially, highmortality. Understanding the pathways involved in endometrial cancerchemoresistance is paramount for the identification of biomarkers and novelmolecular targets for this disease. Here, we generated the first matched pairs ofcarboplatin-sensitive/carboplatin-resistant andpaclitaxel-sensitive/paclitaxel-resistant endometrial cancer cells and subjected them to bulk RNA sequencing analysis. We found that 45 genes are commonlyupregulated in carboplatin- and paclitaxel-resistant cells as compared tocontrols. Of these, the leukemia inhibitory factor, (LIF), the protein tyrosinephosphatase type IVA, member 3 (PTP4A3), and the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) showed a highly significant correlation between expression level andendometrial cancer overall survival (OS) and can stratify the 545 endometrialcancer patients in the TCGA cohort into a high-risk and low-risk-cohorts.Additionally, four genes within the 45 upregulated chemoresistance-associatedgenes are ADAMTS5, MICAL2, STAT5A, and PTP4A3 codes for proteins for whichsmall-molecule inhibitors already exist. We identified these proteins asmolecular targets for chemoresistant endometrial cancer and showed that treatmentwith their correspondent inhibitors effectively killed otherwise chemoresistantcells. Collectively, these findings underline the utility of matched pair ofchemosensitive and chemoresistant cancer cells to identify markers forendometrial cancer risk stratification and to serve as a pharmacogenomics modelfor identification of alternative chemotherapy approaches for treatment ofpatients with recurrent disease.DOI: 10.1007/s12672-018-0337-6 PMID: 29951943
