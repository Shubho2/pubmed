We investigated the temporal distribution of the disease burden, and the effect of starting and stopping ages and interval between screening mammography examinations, on incidence-basedmortality. Methods Incidence-based mortality was estimated using an establishedbreast cancer simulation model, adapted and validated to simulate breast cancerincidence, screening performance, and delivery of therapies in Canada. Tenstrategies were examined, with varying starting age (40 or 50), stopping age (69 or 74), and interval (1, 2, 3 years), and "No Screening." Life-years lost werecomputed as the difference between model predicted time of breast cancer deathand that estimated from life tables. Results Without screening, 70% of the burdenin terms of breast cancer deaths extends between ages 45 and 75. The mean of the distribution of ages of detection of breast cancers that will be fatal in anunscreened population is 61.8 years, while the mean age of detection weighted by the number of life-years lost is 55, a downward shift of 6.8 years. Similarly,the mean age of detection for the distribution of life-years gained throughscreening is lower than that for breast cancer deaths averted. ConclusionIncidence-based mortality predictions from modeling elucidate the age dependence of the breast cancer burden and can provide guidance for optimizing the timing ofscreening regimens to achieve maximal impact. Of the regimens studied, thegreatest lifesaving effect was achieved with annual screening beginning at age40.DOI: 10.1177/0969141318780152 PMID: 30049249
