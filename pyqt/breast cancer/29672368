We evaluated the efficacy of the first pectoral nerve block (Pecs I) in treating postoperative pain afterbreast cancer surgery.METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, dual-centered, placebo-controlled trial was performed. One hundred twenty-eight patients scheduled for unilateral breastcancer surgery were recruited. A multimodal analgesic regimen andsurgeon-administered local anesthetic infiltration were used for all patients.Ultrasound-guided Pecs I was performed using bupivacaine or saline. The primaryoutcome was the patient pain score (numerical rating scale [NRS]) in the recoveryunit 30 minutes after admission or just before the morphine administration (NRS≥4/10). The secondary outcomes were postoperative opioid consumption (ie, in the recovery unit and after 24 hours).RESULTS: During recovery, no significant difference in NRS was observed betweenthe bupivacaine (n = 62, 3.0 [1.0-4.0]) and placebo (n = 65, 3.0 [1.0-5.0])groups (P = 0.55). However, the NRS was statistically significantly different,although not clinically significant, for patients undergoing major surgeries(mastectomies or tumorectomies with axillary clearance) (n = 29, 3.0 [0.0-4.0] vs4.0 [2.0-5.0], P = 0.04). Morphine consumption during recovery did not differ(1.5 mg [0.0-6.0 mg] vs 3.0 mg [0.0-6.0 mg], P = 0.20), except in the majorsurgery subgroup (1.5 mg [0.0-6.0 mg] vs 6.0 mg [0.0-12.0 mg], P = 0.016).Intraoperative sufentanil and cumulative morphine consumption up to 24 hours did not differ between the 2 groups. Three patients experienced complications relatedto the Pecs I.CONCLUSIONS: Pecs I is not better than a saline placebo in the presence ofmultimodal analgesia for breast cancer surgery. However, its role in extended(major) breast surgery may warrant further investigation.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,identifier NCT01670448.DOI: 10.1097/AAP.0000000000000779 PMID: 29672368
