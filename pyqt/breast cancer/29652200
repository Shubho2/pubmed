In traditional medicine, extracts from different species of Burserahave been used for a wide range of biological activities, including the treatmentof cancer-related symptoms. Compounds present in the Bursera genus includelignans, flavonoids, steroids, short-chain aliphatic alkanes, acetates, alcohols,ketones, and terpenoids. In some instances, secondary metabolites of theseclasses of compounds may induce cytotoxicity, and therefore we sought toinvestigate the effects of B. copallifera leaf extracts in breast cancer celllines to evaluate their potential therapeutic value for the treatment of breastcancer, one of the most prevalent types of cancer in women worldwide. Two B.copallifera leaf extracts exerted cytotoxic effects on both the MCF7 andMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line models. The cytotoxic effect was more evident in the MDA-MB-231 triple negative cell line inhibiting also the migration ofthese cells. We identified hydroxycinnamic acid and flavonol derivatives as majorphenolic components of the extracts. Our results strongly suggest a potential useof the Bursera leaf extracts rich in phenolic compounds, their individualphenolic compounds, or their combinations for the treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1177/1534735418766416 PMID: 29652200
