However, due to the repetitive nature of TEs, identifying transcription factor (TF)-binding sites from ChIP-sequencing(ChIP-seq) datasets is challenging. Current algorithms are focused on subtledifferences between TE copies and thus bias the analysis to relatively old andinactive TEs. Here we describe an approach termed "MapRRCon" (mapping repeatreads to a consensus) which allows us to identify proteins binding to TE DNAsequences by mapping ChIP-seq reads to the TE consensus sequence afterwhole-genome alignment. Although this method does not assign binding sites toindividual insertions in the genome, it provides a landscape of interacting TFsby capturing factors that bind to TEs under various conditions. We applied thismethod to screen TFs' interaction with L1 in human cells/tissues using ENCODEChIP-seq datasets and identified 178 of the 512 TFs tested as bound to L1 in atleast one biological condition with most of them (138) localized to the promoter.Among these L1-binding factors, we focused on Myc and CTCF, as they playimportant roles in cancer progression and 3D chromatin structure formation.Furthermore, we explored the transcriptomes of The Cancer Genome Atlas breast andovarian tumor samples in which a consistent anti-/correlation between L1 andMyc/CTCF expression was observed, suggesting that these two factors may playroles in regulating L1 transcription during the development of such tumors.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).
