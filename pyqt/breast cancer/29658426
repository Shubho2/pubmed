As part of our review, wetabulated the demographic and life history data, breast cancer risk factors,occupational history, and exposure estimates collected and analyzed in eachstudy. Opportunities exist for future research to explore occupation and breastcancer more rigorously and with greater nuance by gathering specific data on age at diagnosis, menopausal status, tumor characteristics, demographics, breastcancer risk factors, and occupational histories, work roles and settings, andexposures. Inclusion of workers in the planning and implementation of research ontheir occupational risks and exposures is one effective way to refine researchquestions and ensure research is relevant to workers' needs and concerns.DOI: 10.1177/1048291118758713 PMID: 29658426
