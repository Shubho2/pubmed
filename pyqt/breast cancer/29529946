Themessenger RNA and protein expressions of rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, MEK,extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and their phosphorylated (p-) proteinswere examined by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction andimmunohistochemistry, respectively. All patients received a 1-year follow-up, andthe clinical follow-up data were collected. The multiple factors on the prognosisof patients with breast cancer having axillary lymph node metastasis were tested by Cox regression analysis.RESULTS: The messenger RNA expressions of rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, MEK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase and positive rates of rapidlyaccelerated fibrosarcoma, MEK, phosphorylated MEK, extracellular signal-regulatedkinase, and p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase in the axillary lymph nodemetastasis group were higher than in the non-axillary lymph node metastasis andnormal groups (all P < .05). The protein expressions of rapidly acceleratedfibrosarcoma, MEK, phosphorylated MEK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, andp-extracellular signal-regulated kinase were associated with tumor size, clinicalstage, and axillary lymph node metastasis number (all P < .05). Rapidlyaccelerated fibrosarcoma, MEK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinaseexpressions were significantly correlated with the prognosis of patients withbreast cancer (all P < .05). Patients with BC having positive rapidly acceleratedfibrosarcoma, MEK, phosphorylated MEK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, andphosphorylated ERK expressions had a higher survival rate than patients with BChaving the negative ones (all P < .05). Rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma andextracellular signal-regulated kinase protein expressions, clinical stage,pathological grade, and axillary lymph node metastasis number were independentprognostic factors in patients with breast cancer having axillary lymph nodemetastasis (all P < .05).CONCLUSION: Our study proved that rapidly acceleratedfibrosarcoma/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway issignificantly correlated with the clinicopathological features and prognosis for patients with BC having axillary lymph node metastasis. Rapidly acceleratedfibrosarcoma and extracellular signal-regulated kinase protein expressions areindependent prognostic factors for patients with breast cancer having axillarylymph node metastasis.DOI: 10.1177/1533034617754024 PMCID: PMC5858680PMID: 29529946
