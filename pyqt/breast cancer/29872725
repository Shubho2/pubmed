A number of transcripts areregulated by this pathway and are recurrently identified in genome-based MAPKtranscriptional signatures. To test whether the transcriptional output of only 10of these targets could quantify MAPK pathway activity with potential predictiveor prognostic clinical utility, we created a MAPK Pathway Activity Score (MPAS)derived from aggregated gene expression. In vitro, MPAS predicted sensitivity to MAPK inhibitors in multiple cell lines, comparable to or better than largergenome-based statistical models. Bridging in vitro studies and clinical samples, median MPAS from a given tumor type correlated with cobimetinib (MEK inhibitor)sensitivity of cancer cell lines originating from the same tissue type.Retrospective analyses of clinical datasets showed that MPAS was associated with the sensitivity of melanomas to vemurafenib (HR: 0.596) and negatively prognosticof overall or progression-free survival in both adjuvant and metastatic CRC (HR: 1.5 and 1.4), adrenal cancer (HR: 1.7), and HER2+ breast cancer (HR: 1.6). MPASthus demonstrates potential clinical utility that warrants further exploration.DOI: 10.1038/s41698-018-0051-4 PMCID: PMC5871852PMID: 29872725
