The primary endpoint,the proportion of spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) responders, was met. Here, we report results from secondary endpoints including quality of life (QOL)assessments from these studies.Patients and methods: In COMPOSE-4, eligible adults with OIC and cancer wererandomly assigned 1:1 to receive once-daily oral naldemedine 0.2 mg (n=97) orplacebo (n=96) for 2 weeks, and those who continued on to COMPOSE-5 receivednaldemedine for 12 weeks (n=131). Secondary assessments in COMPOSE-4 included theproportion of complete SBM (CSBM) responders, SBM or CSBM responders by week, andsubjects with ≥1 SBM or CSBM within 24 hours post-initial dose. Changes frombaseline in the frequency of SBMs or CSBMs per week were assessed at Week 1 andWeek 2. Time to the first SBM or CSBM post-initial dose was also evaluated. Inboth studies, QOL impact was evaluated by Patient Assessment ofConstipation-Symptoms (PAC-SYM) and PAC-QOL questionnaires.Results: Naldemedine improved bowel function for all secondary efficacyassessments vs placebo (all P≤0.0002). The timely onset of naldemedine activityvs placebo was evidenced by median time to the first SBM (4.7 vs 26.6 hours) and CSBM (24.0 vs 218.5 hours) post-initial dose (all P<0.0001). In COMPOSE-4,significant differences between groups were observed with the PAC-SYM stooldomain (P=0.045) and PAC-QOL dissatisfaction domain (P=0.015). In COMPOSE-5,naldemedine significantly improved overall and individual domain scores ofPAC-SYM and PAC-QOL from baseline (all P≤0.03).Conclusions: Naldemedine provided effective and timely symptomatic relief fromOIC and improved the QOL of subjects with OIC and cancer.Trial registration ID: www.ClinicalTrials.jp: JAPIC-CTI-132340 (COMPOSE-4) andJAPIC-CTI-132342 (COMPOSE-5).DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy118 PMCID: PMC6005145PMID: 29912271
