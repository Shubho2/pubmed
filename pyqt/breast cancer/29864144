Activity andbiological function of EZH2 are regulated by posttranslational modifications. It is suggested that EZH2 stability may be regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which is an enzyme catalyzing the addition of GlcNAc moieties to target proteins.In this study, we determined the impact of OGT on expression of EZH2 target genesFOXA1 and FOXC1, that are involved in breast cancer progression. The results ofchromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that both EZH2 and OGT aretargeted to the promoter regions of FOXA1 and FOXC1 and knockdown of EZH2 or OGT affects expression of studied genes in breast non-malignant (MCF10A) and cancercells (MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB-231). The results showed that OGT silencing affects EZH2 binding to FOXC1 promoter but the effect is cell-context dependent. Despite the slight decrease in EZH2 protein level in cells with OGT depletion, EZH2binding to FOXC1 was increased. Moreover, OGT binding to promoter regions ofFOXA1 and FOXC1 was increased in cells with knockdown of EZH2. Increasedexpression of FOXA1 and FOXC1 in cells with OGT deregulation was associated with increased acetylation level of histone H3. The results suggest that OGT isinvolved in regulation of FOXA1 and FOXC1 expression but its role is notassociated with regulation of EZH2 protein stability.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198351 PMCID: PMC5986130PMID: 29864144
