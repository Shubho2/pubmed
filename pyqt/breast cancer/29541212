China.Breast cancer is the most common type of malignant cancer in females. Anincreasing number of studies have revealed that microRNAs (miR), which belong to a class of small non-coding RNAs, serve an important role in a number of humancancer subtypes. In the present study, the role of miR-194 in breast cancer cellsand its underlying mechanisms were investigated. The results demonstrated thatthe serum levels of miR-194 were significantly higher in patients of the poorlydifferentiated and well-differentiated groups, compared with in healthy adults.Additionally, the serum level of miR-194 was significantly higher in the poorlydifferentiated group compared with in the well-differentiated group. In order to further investigate the role of miR-194 in breast cancer cells, the present studytransfected two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, with an emptyvector (control), miR-194 (overexpression), antagomiR-194 (inhibitor, functional knock down) or antagomiR-194 and miR-194. An MTT assay was performed in order to detect the proliferation of breast cancer cells in the various groups. Theresults revealed that the overexpression of miR-194 significantly acceleratedcell proliferation, whereas the inhibition of miR-194 significantly deceleratedthe proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, the expressionlevels of cyclin D and cyclin E were significantly upregulated in miR-194overexpressing cells, and the expression levels of cyclin D and cyclin E weresignificantly downregulated in miR-194 inhibited cells, as compared with incontrol cells. No significant change was observed in the level of proliferationof cells co-transfected with miR-194 and antagomiR-194, compared with in thecontrol cells. According to the hypothesis suggesting possible target genes ofmiR-194, the present study proposed that F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7(Fbxw-7) may be a direct target of miR-194, which was confirmed by a luciferasereporter assay. The present study suggested that miR-194 expression promoted the proliferation of breast cancer cells by targeting Fbxw-7, and may serve as abiomarker and a novel target for breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7842 PMCID: PMC5835911PMID: 29541212
