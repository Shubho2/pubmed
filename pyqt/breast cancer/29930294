Clinical hallmarks of IBCinclude tumor emboli in lymphatic vessels and E-cadherin overexpression, whichsupports a type of metastasis referred to as cell cluster-based metastasis,prevalent in IBC. In contrast, we previously reported epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition (EMT)-based progression of IBC, utilizing in vivo xenografts and invitro Matrigel culture models. To address these two contradictory concepts of IBCmetastasis, we used Matrigel culture to induce EMT in a panel of IBC cells.Results revealed Matrigel culture induced vimentin expression in SUM149 andSUM190 IBC cells at the transcriptional and protein levels while maintaining the expression of E-cadherin, a phenomenon referred to as partial EMT.Transcriptional profiling revealed that expression of colony-stimulating factor 1(CSF-1) was induced in Matrigel culture. When the receptor tyrosine kinase ofCSF-1 (CSF-1R) was inhibited by CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945, the partial EMT wasreversed in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the CSF-1/CSF-1R axis plays a key role in controlling partial EMT. This observation may help reconcile thetwo contradictory theories of IBC metastasis, EMT vs cell cluster-basedmetastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27409-x PMCID: PMC6013474PMID: 29930294
