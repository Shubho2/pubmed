Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health.(2)Cancer Institute, Salamanca University, Spain.(3)University Clinic Hospital, Madrid.Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein coding RNAs that modulate geneexpression after transcription. Few studies have shown that male breast cancer(MBC) shows distinctive miRNAs pattern, suggesting its relevance in thispathology. To study this, we performed a profile of 800 miRNAs in 9 MBC samplesand in normal epithelial cells of 3 MBC cases.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Of FFPEtissues, miRNA was extracted for profiles using the NanoString method. miRNAswere obtained by comparing tumor samples versus normal epithelium. Quantitativereal-time PCR analyzes were performed by the TaqMan approach for specific miRNAs.RESULTS: The profile of 800 miRNAs showed a different microRNA expression patternbetween MBC and its normal counterpart, suggesting a specific microRNA cancerexpression profile for MBC. Forty-nine miRNAs showed greater expression, while 26were found to be down-regulated in MBC, compared to normal tissue. The lowerexpression of miR-125b correlated significantly with tumors> 2 cm, suggestingthat its down-regulation may be implicated in mechanisms to more aggressivetumors.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MBC has a unique expression profilecompared to normal breast tissue and expression profile of female breast cancer. Differentially expressed miRNAs provide insights of this uncommon but highlyaggressive pathology.DOI: 10.7150/jca.23151 PMCID: PMC5820911PMID: 29483949
