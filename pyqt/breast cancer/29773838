We included all Stage I toIII patients treated with trastuzumab with a minimum follow up of 3 years. Thedate of first breast biopsy was recorded as initial diagnosis.RESULTS: A total of 506 patients [adjuvant: 386 (76%)-neo-adjuvant: 120 (24%)]were included. The median time-to-first-trastuzumab (TFT) from diagnosis was 12weeks (range 1.9-122.3). Median follow-up is 73.3 months (range 1.4-176.3). TFTwas significantly shorter in the neo-adjuvant than in the adjuvant cohort(median: 4.4 vs. 14 weeks, p < 0.00001). Despite the neo-adjuvant cohort havingsignificantly more node-positive patients (75 vs. 53%, p < 0.0001), DFS rate(neo-adjuvant: 12.5 vs. adjuvant: 18%, p = 0.094) was numerically superior inneo-adjuvant patients. A TFT ≤ 12 weeks was associated with significantlysuperior DFS and OS over TFT > 12 weeks. Early concomitant regimens wereassociated with superior DFS over delayed-concomitant and sequential regimens.CONCLUSIONS: Initiating trastuzumab more than 12 weeks from diagnosis has anegative impact on clinical outcome. Neo-adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy could be the optimal strategy to treat early stage HER2-positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0114-x PMID: 29773838
