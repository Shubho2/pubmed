In fact, IIGFs is often deregulated incancer. In particular, the mitogenic insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) and theinsulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) are frequently overexpressed incancer together with their cognate ligands IGF-1 and IGF-2. Recently, weidentified discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) as a new IR-A interacting protein. DDR1, a non-integrin collagen tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed inseveral malignancies and plays a role in cancer progression and metastasis.Herein, we review recent findings indicating that DDR1 is as a novel modulator ofIR and IGF-1R expression and function. DDR1 functionally interacts with IR andIGF-1R and enhances the biological actions of insulin, IGF-1 and IGF-2.Conversely, DDR1 is upregulated by IGF-1, IGF-2 and insulin through thePI3K/AKT/miR-199a-5p circuit. Furthermore, we discuss the role of thenon-canonical estrogen receptor GPER1 in the DDR1-IIGFs crosstalk. These datasuggest a wider role of DDR1 as a regulator of cell response to hormones, growth factors, and signals coming from the extracellular matrix.DOI: 10.1080/19336918.2018.1445953 PMID: 29486622
