Here, we performed ameta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to better define the benefitand the risk of CDK4/6 inhibitors plus ET for endocrine-sensitive orendocrine-resistant population in metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer.METHOD: A systematic literature search of Pubmed, Embase, and the CochraneLibrary was carried out up to 30 June 2018. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) for progression-free survival (PFS), as well as oddsratios (ORs) for objective response rates, ≥ G3-G4 adverse events (AEs), andG3-G4 neutropenia were calculated for each trial. A meta-analysis was carried outusing the random-effects model.RESULTS: Eight RCTs were eligible including 4578 breast cancer patients. AddingCDK4/6 inhibitors to ET in endocrine-sensitive (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.50-0.62) orendocrine-resistant setting (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43-0.61) significantly improvedthe PFS of metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancers regardless of menopausal statusand site of metastasis. Moreover, CDK4/6 inhibitors plus ET meaningfully improvedobjective response rate in endocrine-sensitive (ORs 0.62, 95% CI 0.52-0.73) orendocrine-resistant setting (ORs 0.33, 95% CI 0.24-0.47). The use of these drugs was characterized by a significant increase of G3-G4 AEs (OR 10.88, 95% CI6.53-18.14).CONCLUSION: Emerging data provide a new standard treatment for advanced HR+/HER2-breast cancer, regardless of menopausal status, prior hormonal/chemotherapytreatments delivered, sites of metastasis. However, benefits should be balancedwith longer treatment duration, toxicities, and costs.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4901-0 PMID: 30054831
