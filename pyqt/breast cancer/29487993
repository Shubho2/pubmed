A single10-min course of dual-phase protocol of pulsed Er:YAG laser (2940 nm, fractional ablative and thermal mode, fluence according to tissue thickness). Follow-upincluded subjective satisfaction, vaginal pH, vaginal health index (VHI), andcomplications after 6 weeks.RESULTS: A total of 16 breast cancer survivors (age 71 years, SD 7) had beenseeking treatment for pelvic floor symptoms related to vaginal atrophy atfollow-up visits after prolapse surgery. All ablative vaginal Er:YAG laseroutpatient procedures were successfully completed, all patients returned to dailyactivities without a need for analgetic medication. Evaluation was performedafter 8.3 (SD 2.5) weeks. Pre-laser VHI scored 16 (SD 4.6) and post-laser VHI 20 (SD 3) with p = 0.01. Patients were satisfied in 94% (n = 15) regarding symptomrelief.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer survivors with atrophy-related complaints after pelvicfloor surgery may benefit from vaginal application of this innovative dualprotocol of Er:YAG laser technology as a non-hormonal treatment approach.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2614-8 PMID: 29487993  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
