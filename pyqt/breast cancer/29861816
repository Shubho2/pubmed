If inflammation is recognized to favor the formation of vascular"metastatic niches," little is known about the contribution of blood rheology to CTC deposition. Herein, a microfluidic chip, covered by a confluent monolayer of endothelial cells, is used for analyzing the adhesion and rolling of colorectal(HCT-15) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cells under different biophysicalconditions. These include the analysis of cell transport in a physiologicalsolution and whole blood over a healthy and a TNF-α inflamed endothelium with aflow rate of 50 and 100 nl/min. Upon stimulation of the endothelial monolayerwith TNF-α (25 ng/ml), CTC adhesion increases from 2 to 4 times whilst cellrolling velocity only slightly reduces. Notably, whole blood also enhances cancercell deposition from 2 to 3 times, but only on the unstimulated vasculature. For all tested conditions, no statistically significant difference is observedbetween the two cancer cell types. Finally, a computational model for CTCtransport demonstrates that a rigid cell approximation reasonably predictsrolling velocities while cell deformability is needed to model adhesion. Theseresults would suggest that, within microvascular networks, blood rheology andinflammation contribute similarly to CTC deposition, thereby facilitating theformation of metastatic niches along the entire network, including the healthyendothelium. In microfluidic-based assays, neglecting blood rheology wouldsignificantly underestimate the metastatic potential of cancer cells.DOI: 10.1063/1.5022879 PMCID: PMC5957635 [Available on 2019-05-17]PMID: 29861816
