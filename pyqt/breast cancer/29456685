China.MicroRNAs (miRs) have previously been demonstrated to be important in thetumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer. miR-372 was previously revealedto be involved in various types of human cancer, however its function in breastcancer remains largely unknown. The present study demonstrated that miR-372 isfrequently overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. Thedownregulation of miR-372 markedly inhibited cell proliferation, arrested thecell cycle in the G1/S phase, and increased the apoptosis of breast cancer cells.Consistently, an in vivo xenograft study also demonstrated the suppressiveeffects of miR-372 knockdown on tumor growth. Further studies revealed thatmiR-372 modulated the expression of large tumor suppressor kinase 2 (LATS2) bydirectly targeting its 3'-untranslated region in breast cancer cells.Furthermore, silencing of LATS2 was able to rescue the effect of the miR-372inhibitor. Overall, the results suggest that miR-372 functions as an oncogenicmiRNA in breast cancer by targeting LATS2.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2018.5761 PMCID: PMC5795589PMID: 29456685
