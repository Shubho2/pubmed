Egypt.In view of their expected anticancer activity, novel triazolo[3,4-a]phthalazinederivatives 5-6a-o and3-substituted-bis([1,2,4]triazolo)[3,4-a:4&#039;,3&#039;-c]phthalazines 9a-b weredesigned, synthesized and evaluated for their anti-proliferative activity againsttwo human tumor cell lines HCT-116 human colon adenocarcinoma and MCF-7 breastcancer. It was found that, compound 6o the most potent derivative against bothHCT116 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines. Compounds 6o, 6m, 6d and 9b showed thehighest anticancer activities against HCT116 human colon adenocarcinoma with IC50of 7±0.06, 13±0.11, 15±0.14 and 23±0.22 µM respectively while compounds 6o, 6d,6a and 6n showed the highest anticancer activities against MCF-7 breast cancerwith IC50 of 16.98±0.15, 18.2±0.17, 57.54±0.53 and 66.45±0.67 µM respectively.Sorafenib as a highly potent VEGFR-2 inhibitor was used as a reference drug with IC50 of 5.47±0.3 and 7.26±0.3 µM respectively. Nine compounds were furtherevaluated for their VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity. Compounds 6o, 6m, 6d and 9bemerged as the most active counterparts against VEGFR-2 with IC50 values of0.1±0.01, 0.15±0.02, 0.28±0.03 and 0.38±0.04 µM, respectively comparable to that of sorafenib (IC50 = 0.1±0.02) µM. Furthermore, molecular docking studies werecarried out for all synthesized compounds to investigate their binding patternand predict their binding affinities towards VEGFR-2 active site. In silico ADMETstudies were calculated for the tested compounds. Most of our designed compounds exhibited good ADMET profile.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180412123833 PMID: 29651967
