The results aremainly obtained from observational studies and thus, little information isavailable concerning the mechanisms of action. Adenosine monophosphate(AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays an important role in the mechanism ofaction of metformin. The anti-cancer mechanisms of metformin include direct andindirect effects. The direct effects of metformin include AMPK-independent andAMPK-dependent effects, whereas the decrease in glucose level, hyperinsulinemia, and Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) level was considered its indirecteffects. Metformin also decreases both pro-inflammatory cytokines and nuclearfactor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and improves theimmune response to cancer cells. Although the results of recent trials confirmthe efficacy of metformin in prevention and treatment of different cancers, theevidence is not adequate enough. This paper reviews recently available evidenceon anti-cancer effects of metformin. The effects of metformin in specific cancersincluding colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, renal, cervical, endometrial,gastric, lung, breast, and ovarian cancer are also reviewed in this paper.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1389200219666180416161846 PMID: 29663879
