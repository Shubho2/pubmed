G6PDH positivity was associated with ER negativity (p =0.001), PR negativity (p = 0.001), and HER-2 positivity (p < 0.001), whereas 6PGLpositivity was associated with higher T stage (p = 0.004). The 562 expressionprofile from the TCGA database revealed increased expression of G6PDH and 6PG in the tumor compared with normal adjacent breast tissue. The expression of G6PDHwas highest in HER-2 type. HER-2 and basal-like subtypes showed higher expressionof 6PGDH than luminal types.Conclusion: PPP-related proteins are differentially expressed in breast canceraccording to molecular subtype, and higher expression of G6PDH and 6PGL was notedin HER-2 subtype.DOI: 10.1155/2018/9369358 PMCID: PMC5845514PMID: 29682102
