This study aimed to determine the rate and distribution ofSPMs for photon- or neutron-emitting radiotherapy sources for patients treatedfor primary endometrial cancer.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cohort comprised 426 patients with 5334 patient-years of observation. Patients were treated by different methods of RT from 1990 to2000. Patients received postoperative 60Co external-beam radiotherapy (43.4%),external-beam radiotherapy + high-dose-rate (HDR) intracavitary brachytherapywith 60Co or 252Cf (42.3%), or HDR intracavitary brachytherapy alone with 60Co or252Cf (14.3%).RESULTS: Over a 25-year period, 47 SPMs were observed (21 for HDR 60Co and 26 forHDR 252Cf). SPMs were observed for 13 patients in the high-intermediate riskgroup for each radiation source. Patients treated with 60Co developed SPMs in theurinary tract (1.2%) and in lymphoid/hematopoietic tissues (1.2%). Only three SPMcases (0.7%) were observed in digestive tract. In comparison, the patient grouptreated with 252Cf developed SPMs in the digestive tract (1.4%) with the majorityin the colon (1.2%), urinary tract (0.9%) primarily the kidneys, and vulva(0.7%). All other SPMs (4.9%) were in the low-risk group. Of these, SPMs in theskin were most prevalent (1.6%) for 60Co, and breast (1.6%) for 252Cf, butbelieved to be caused by factors other than treatment. SPM incidence in thedigestive and urinary tracts were similar (2.1%), regardless of radiation source.CONCLUSIONS: For followup at 25 years, 47 SPMs were observed with no differences in the high-intermediate risk group depending on the RT source.Copyright © 2018 American Brachytherapy Society.
