[Epubahead of print]Viewing the Eph receptors with a focus on breast cancer heterogeneity.Nikas I(1), Ryu HS(2), Theocharis S(3).Author information: (1)First Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of Athens, Athens,Greece; School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.(2)Department of Pathology, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republicof Korea.(3)First Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of Athens, Athens,Greece. Electronic address: statheocharis@yahoo.com.Aberrant expression of different family members of the Eph/ephrin system, whichcomprises the Eph receptors (Ephs) and their ligands (ephrins), has beenimplicated in various malignancies including breast cancer. The latter presentsas a heterogeneous disease with diverse molecular, morphologic and clinicalbehavior signatures. This review reflects the existing Eph/ephrin literaturewhile focusing on breast cancer heterogeneity. Hormone positive, HER2 positiveand triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines, xenografts/mutant animalmodels and patient samples are examined separately as, in humans, they represent entities with differences in prognosis and treatment. EphA2, EphB4 and EphB6 are the members most extensively studied in breast cancer. Existing research pointsto the potential use of various Eph/ephrin members as biomarkers for assessingprognosis and selecting the most suitable therapeutic strategies in variableclinical scenarios, also for overcoming drug resistance, in the era of breastcancer heterogeneity.Copyright Â© 2018.
