[Epub ahead of print]Extracellular vesicles and anti-Cancer drug resistance.Namee NM(1), O'Driscoll L(2).Author information: (1)School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences & Trinity Biomedical SciencesInstitute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.(2)School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences & Trinity Biomedical SciencesInstitute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland. Electronic address:lodrisc@tcd.ie.Extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes, microvesicles, oncosomes, andmicroparticles have been associated with communicating anti-cancerdrug-resistance. The in vitro, pre-clinical in vivo and patients' data linkingEVs to drug-resistance (and the specific drugs involved) in breast cancer,prostate cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, haematological malignancies,colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma,neuroblastoma, melanoma, kidney cancer and osteosarcoma. Details of themechanisms by which the resistance seems to be occurring (e.g. EVs transferringdrug-efflux pumps from drug-resistant cancer cells, EVs binding monoclonalantibodies in the peripheral circulation and so reducing their bioavailability,EVs from tumour microenvironment cells, etc.) are outlined, as are efforts to tryto block such resistance. Research to date strongly supports EVs as playing a keyrole in drug-resistance. Further studies including tailored clinical studies are now warranted to determine how best to prevent this occurring, in the interest ofpatients and also for economic benefit. Furthermore, efforts to exploit safe(non-cancer origin) EVs as anti-cancer drug delivery vehicles that may achieveefficacy with more limited side-effects than free drug, deserve furtherinvestigation.Copyright Â© 2018.
