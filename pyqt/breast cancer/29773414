Patients received 42.4 Gy in 16 daily fractions (2.65 Gyper fraction). A boost was only administered in cases of grade 3 primary tumorand close or positive margins. Acute and late toxicity was prospectively assessedduring and after hypo-RT, based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale.DFS and local recurrence-free survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method for cumulative probability. Log-rank tests were used to identify differences bysubtype. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the impact ofvarious factors on the risk of disease progression.RESULTS: Among the 752 patients treated, 41 (5.5%) experienced diseaseprogression, including 7 (17.1%) exclusively local recurrences; 1 (2.4%) localand nodal recurrence; 1 (2.4%) local and nodal recurrence plus metastasis; 7(17.1%) nodal recurrences plus metastases; and 25 (61%) exclusively distantmetastases. The 5-year DFS, local recurrence-free survival, breastcancer-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 91.8% (95% confidenceinterval [CI], 88.6-94.2), 98.0% (95% CI, 96.1-99.1), 98.2% (95% CI, 96.5-99.1), and 87.5% (95% CI, 83.8-90.5), respectively. On univariate analysis, theadministration of a boost, disease grade (grades 1 and 2 vs. 3), and molecularsubtype (triple negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]positive, or luminal B vs. luminal A) significantly affected disease progression (P < .01). These findings were confirmed by multivariate analysis.CONCLUSION: Hypo-RT is effective and well tolerated in the elderly population,and the routine use of a boost for patients over 65 years is not justified.Further studies on the boost issue are strongly advocated.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
