The current study wasaimed to clarify the ambiguity in genetic associations of these enzymes withbreast cancer risk on a global perspective. A systematic literature search wascarried out in PubMed, Google Scholar and Medline, covering all the case-control studies published until September 2017. A meta-analysis was performed based onthe random-effect and fixed-effect models to calculate the overall association ofeach genetic variant with breast cancer risk. Of the five polymorphisms studied, GSTT1 (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.12 and OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15 forfixed-effect and random-effect models, respectively) and GSTM1 (OR: 1.22, 95% CI:1.17-1.26 and OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12-1.35 for fixed-effect and random-effectmodels, respectively) null polymorphisms exhibited an increased risk for breastcancer in both the models. Cochrane Q-test and IÂ² statistics revealedheterogeneity in association with these polymorphisms (P< 0.0001) with noevidence of publication bias. Thus, GSTT1 and GSTM1 null polymorphisms are riskfactors for breast cancer.PMID: 29932073
