Improvingliteracy about the financial aspects of cancer care may decrease the negativefinancial impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment. We obtained input frompatient stakeholders on the perceived value and optimal design of a financialliteracy program in the advanced cancer setting.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort survey.METHODS: Â A series of semi-structured interviews were conducted, during whichpatients with either colorectal or breast cancer were asked to describe theimpact of cancer on their finances and employment, to state their preferencesabout discussing costs with their providers, and to give input on development of a financial literacy course.RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (76% Caucasian) completed interviews, the majorityof whom had Medicare or commercial insurance (71%). Lost income from earlyretirement or disability was the most financially burdensome experience for 67%of patients. The majority of patients (76%) reported that a financial literacycourse would be helpful in navigating the cost of cancer care. Most preferred thecourse be administered at diagnosis in a live group format.CONCLUSIONS: Feedback from patients with cancer supported the development of agroup financial literacy course that addresses barriers to discussing costconcerns, employment changes during cancer, and available resources for financialassistance.DOI: 87036 PMID: 29648736
