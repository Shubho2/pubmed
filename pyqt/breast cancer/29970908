However, the biological functions of FOXP3 in breastcancer angiogenesis remain unclear. Here we found that the clinical expression ofnuclear FOXP3 was inversely correlated with breast cancer angiogenesis. Moreover,the animal study demonstrated that FOXP3 significantly reduced the microvascular density of MDA-MB-231 tumors transplanted in mice. The cytological experimentsshowed that the supernatant from FOXP3-overexpressing cells exhibited adiminished ability to stimulate tube formation and sprouting in HUVECs in vitro. In addition, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) wasdownregulated by FOXP3 in breast cancer cell lines. Luciferase reporter assaysand chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that FOXP3 can directlyinteract with the VEGF promoter via specific forkhead-binding motifs to suppress its transcription. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of FOXP3 in thesupernatant on tube formation and sprouting in HUVECs could be reversed by addingVEGF in vitro. Nuclear FOXP3 expression was inversely correlated with VEGFexpression in clinical breast cancer tissues, and FOXP3 downregulation and VEGFupregulation were both correlated with reduced survival in breast cancer datasets in the Kaplan-Meier plotter. Taken together, our data demonstrate that FOXP3suppresses breast cancer angiogenesis by downregulating VEGF expression.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0790-8 PMCID: PMC6030162PMID: 29970908
