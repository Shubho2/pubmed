Electronicaddress: m.ahram@ju.edu.jo.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype that lackseffective targeted therapeutics strategy and has poor prognosis. Targetingandrogen receptor (AR) in TNBC is thought to be a promising approach. Wehypothesized that AR, functioning as a transcription factor, controls cellbehavior via regulating the expression of microRNA molecules (miRNAs). Theexpression of 84 breast cancer-specific miRNAs in MDA-MB-231 cells, a highlyinvasive TNBC model system, was investigated using PCR arrays following treatmentof cells with 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The expression of 33 miRNAs waschanged by more than 2 folds including miR-328-3p, which was up-regulated by 13folds. Transfection of cells with either miR-328-3p mimic or anti-sense moleculesdecreased cell motility. DHT-mediated effect on the expression and function ofCD44, a target of miR-328-3p, was investigated. CD44 expression and cell adhesionto hyaluronic acid (HA) were down-regulated when cells were treated with DHT ortransfection with a miR-328-3p mimic. On the other hand, the AR antagonist,bicalutamide, or transfection of cells with miR-328-3p anti-sense molecules hadthe opposite effect. Cells transfected with miR-328-3p anti-sense moleculesreduced the negative effect of DHT on CD44 expression and cell adhesion to HA. Inaddition, DHT further reduced the expression of CD44 and cell adhesion to HA incells transfected with miR-328-3p mimic. These results strongly suggest thatmiRNAs can mediate AR regulation of breast cancer cells and that AR controls the expression of CD44 via miRNA-dependent and independent mechanisms.Copyright © 2018.
