The present study assessed long-termeffects of the exercise program on levels of fatigue and physical activity4 years after participation in the PACT study.METHODS: The original study was a two-armed, multicenter randomized controlledtrial comparing an 18-week supervised exercise program to usual care among 204breast cancer patients and 33 colon cancer patients undergoing adjuvanttreatment. Of the 237 PACT participants, 197 participants were eligible andapproached to participate in the 4-year post-baseline measurements, and 128patients responded. We assessed fatigue and physical activity levels at 4 yearspost-baseline and compared this to levels at baseline, post-intervention(18 weeks post-baseline), and at 36 weeks post-baseline.RESULTS: Intention-to-treat mixed linear effects model analyses showed thatcancer patients in the intervention group reported significantly highermoderate-to-vigorous total physical activity levels (141.46 min/week (95%confidence interval (CI) 1.31, 281.61, effect size (ES) = 0.22) after 4 yearscompared to the usual care group. Furthermore, cancer patients in theintervention group tended to experience less physical fatigue at 4 yearspost-baseline compared to the usual care group (- 1.13, 95% CI -2.45, 0.20,ES = 0.22), although the result was not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: Patients with breast or colon cancer who participated in the 18-week exercise intervention showed significant higher levels of moderate-to-vigoroustotal physical activity levels and a tendency towards lower physical fatiguelevels 4 years post-baseline. Our result indicate that exercising duringchemotherapy is a promising strategy for minimizing treatment-related sideeffects, both short and long term.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN43801571 , Dutch TrialRegister NTR2138 .
