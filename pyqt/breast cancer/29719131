Theproduction of nature-inspired cyclic prodiginines was enabled by combiningorganic synthesis with a mutasynthesis approach based on the GRAS (generallyrecognized as safe) certified host strain Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The newlyprepared prodiginines exerted antimicrobial effects against relevant alternative biotechnological microbial hosts whereas P. putida itself exhibited remarkabletolerance against all tested prodiginines, thus corroborating the bacterium'sexceptional suitability as a mutasynthesis host for the production of thesecytotoxic secondary metabolites. Moreover, the produced cyclic prodigininesproved to be autophagy modulators in human breast cancer cells. One promisingcyclic prodiginine derivative stood out, being twice as potent as prodigiosin,the most prominent member of the prodiginine family, and its synthetic derivativeobatoclax mesylate.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
