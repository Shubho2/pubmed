Epub 2018May 3.Using the lentiviral vector system to stably express chicken P-gp and BCRP inMDCK cells for screening the substrates and studying the interplay of bothtransporters.Zhang Y(1), Huang J(1), Liu Y(1), Guo T(1), Wang L(2).Author information: (1)Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety,College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, 1# Weigang,Nanjing, 210095, People's Republic of China.(2)Joint International Research Laboratory of Animal Health and Food Safety,College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, 1# Weigang,Nanjing, 210095, People's Republic of China. wlp71@163.com.Transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)are known to influence the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of substrate drugs.However, no detailed information is as yet available about functional activityand substrate spectra of chicken P-gp and BCRP. In this study, BCRP single andBCRP/P-gp double-transfected MDCK cell lines (named MDCK-chAbcg2 andMDCK-chAbcg2/Abcb1, respectively) were generated using lentiviral vector systemto develop reliable systems for screening the substrates for these twotransporters and study the interplay between them. The constructed cell linessignificantly expressed functional exogenous proteins and expression persistedfor at least 50 generations with no decrease. Enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin,tilmicosin, sulfadiazine, ampicillin and clindamycin were classified as thesubstrates of chicken P-gp according to the rules suggested by FDA, as their net efflux ratios were greater than two. Similarly, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin,tilmicosin, florfenicol, ampicillin and clindamycin were classified as thesubstrates of BCRP. Among these drugs, enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tilmicosin,ampicillin, and clindamycin were the cosubstrates of P-gp and BCRP, however,chicken BCRP and P-gp exhibit different affinities to the shared substrates atdifferent concentrations by blocking either one or both transport with specificinhibitors in the coexpression system. It was also found that ceftiofur,amoxicillin and doxycycline were not substrates of either chicken BCRP or thesubstrates of chicken P-gp. These constructed cell models provide useful systems for high-throughput screening of the potential substrates of chicken BCRP andP-gp as well as the drug-drug interaction mediated via chicken BCRP and P-gp.DOI: 10.1007/s00204-018-2209-9 PMID: 29725709
