However, the role of absolute non-densearea remains unclear. We estimated the effect of the mammographic non-dense area and other density parameters on the risk of breast cancer.METHODS: This study utilizes data from a population-based case-control studyconducted in Greater Vancouver, British Columbia, with 477 female postmenopausal breast cancer cases and 588 female postmenopausal controls. MD measures weredetermined from digitized screening mammograms using computer-assisted software(Cumulus). Marginal odds ratios were estimated by inverse-probability weightingusing a causal diagram for confounder selection. Akaike information criteria and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the goodness of fit and predictive power of unconditional logistic models containing MD parameters.RESULTS: The risk of breast cancer is 60% lower for the highest quartile comparedto the lowest quartile of mammographic non-dense area (marginal OR 0.40, 95% CI0.26-0.61, p-trend < 0.001). The cancer risk almost doubles for the highestquartile compared to the lowest quartile of dense area (marginal OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.19-2.43, p-trend < 0.001). For the highest quartile of percent density, breast cancer risk was more than three times higher than for the lowest quartile(marginal OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.90-4.40, p-trend < 0.001). No difference was seen in predictive accuracy between models using percent density alone, dense area alone,or non-dense area plus dense area.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, non-dense area is an independent risk factor afteradjustment for dense area and other covariates, inversely related with the riskof breast cancer. However, non-dense area does not improve prediction over thatoffered by percent density or dense area alone.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4737-7 PMID: 29516373
