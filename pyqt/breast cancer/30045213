Cancer and its treatmentmay have immediate or delayed adverse effects on reproductive health.Gynecologists may be consulted for the following issues: pubertal concerns;menstrual irregularities; heavy menstrual bleeding and anemia; sexuality;contraception; ovarian function, including fertility preservation; breast andcervical cancer screening; hormone therapy; and graft-versus-host disease.Approximately 75% of pediatric cancer survivors experience at least one lateeffect on their health or quality of life. Vigilance in screening and observationon behalf of the health care provider with respect to menstrual irregularities,weight changes, sexual health, growth abnormalities, and bone density areimportant. In addition to pretreatment fertility conservation counseling,sexually active young women should be thoroughly educated about the risks ofbecoming pregnant during cancer treatment and strongly encouraged to useeffective contraception; contraceptive choices should be discussed with theoncology team. A multidisciplinary approach to cancer survival care isencouraged. This Committee Opinion has been updated to include current data onsexuality and contraception, sexual dysfunction, risk of graft-versus-hostdisease after stem cell transplant, and updated references and recommendationsfor fertility preservation.DOI: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000002763 PMID: 30045213
