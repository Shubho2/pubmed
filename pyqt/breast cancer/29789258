Electronic address: dequn.sun@sdu.edu.cn.Ten novel artemisinin derivatives containing fluorine atoms were synthesized and their structures were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS technologies in this study. The in vitro cytotoxicity against U87MG, SH-SY5Y, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, A549 and A375 cancer cell lines was evaluated by MTT assay. Compound 9j was the mostpotent anti-proliferative agent against the human breast cancer MCF-7 cells(IC50 = 2.1 μM). The mechanism of action of compound 9j was further investigated by analysis of cell apoptosis and cell cycle. Compound 9j induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at G1 phase in MCF-7 cells. Our promising findingsindicated that the compound 9j could stand as potential lead compound for furtherinvestigation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
