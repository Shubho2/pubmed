[Epub ahead ofprint]Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 promotes recruitment of meiotic recombination-11 tochromatin and DNA double-strand break repair in Ku70-deficient breast cancercells.Huang Y(1), Shao Q(1), Luo X(1)(2), Yang D(1), Zeng B(1), Xiang T(1), RenG(1)(2), Cheng Q(1)(2).Author information: (1)Chongqing Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics, The FirstAffiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.(2)Department of Endocrine and Breast Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital ofChongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 may act in an error-prone pathway calledalternative end joining (Alt-EJ) for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair whennonhomologous end joining is defective. We examined the recruitment of PARP-1 to chromatin in response to radiomimetic agents and the effects of PARP-1 inhibitionon DSB repair and recruitment of the meiotic recombination (MRE)-11-double-strandbreak repair (RAD50) protein-Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NSB)-1 (MRN) complex to the chromatin in Ku70-deficient breast cancer cells. The chromatin-bindingaffinity of PARP-1 was enhanced in response to neocarzinostatin (NCS) orcalicheamicin treatment in the absence of Ku70. PARP-1 inhibition impaired therepair of both NCS-induced DSBs and intron-encoded endonuclease from Physarumpolycephalum-induced site-specific DSB. Both fractionation and chromatinimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that chromatin recruitment of MRN wasPARP-1 dependent. These data suggest that PARP-1 is vital for DSB repair inbreast cancer cells when Alt-EJ is activated.-Huang, Y., Shao, Q., Luo, X., Yang,D., Zeng, B., Xiang, T., Ren, G., Cheng, Q.
