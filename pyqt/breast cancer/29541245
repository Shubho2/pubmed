China.Although nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) is being used more frequently, theoncological safety of NSM remains unclear, particularly in young patients (<35years). The aim of the present study was to compare the rates of local recurrence(LR), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in young patientswith breast cancer who had undergone NSM or conventional mastectomy (CM). Theclinicopathological data of young patients with stage 0-IIB breast cancer who hadundergone NSM (163 cases) or CM (194 cases) between 2007 and 2016 wereretrospectively analyzed. The log-rank test was used to analyze the differencesin the LR, DFS and OS rates between the two groups and multivariate analysis was used to analyze the patient prognostic factors for DFS. The median follow-up timewas 49 months. Patients who had undergone CM were more likely to exhibit stage IIdisease (68.4 vs. 58.3%; P=0.015) and positive lymph nodes (45.9 vs. 33.1%;P=0.014). In the NSM group, LR occurred in 7 (4.3%) cases, systemic recurrence in15 (9.2%) cases and mortality in 9 (5.5%) cases. In the CM group, LR occurred in 6 (3.1%) cases, systemic recurrence in 27 (13.9%) cases and mortality in 15(7.7%) cases. There were no statistical differences in the LR, DFS and OS ratesbetween the two groups (P>0.05). Following adjustment for clinical stage, the LR and DFS rates between the two groups exhibited no significant differences.Analysis of the prognostic factors demonstrated that clinical stage, lymph nodestatus, estrogen and progesterone receptor status and human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 status were associated with DFS (P<0.05). NSM is safe for youngpatients with early-stage breast cancer and provides patients with an improvedcosmetic outcome. Furthermore, nipple-areola complex preservation does notincrease the risk of recurrence.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7913 PMCID: PMC5835917PMID: 29541245
