Performing suchanalyses are challenging because molecular subtype-specific, long-term outcomesare not readily accessible; these markers were not historically recorded in tumorregistries. We present a modeling approach to estimate historical survivaloutcomes by estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2) status.METHOD: Our approach leverages a simulation model of breast cancer outcomes andintegrates data from two sources: the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results(SEER) databases and the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC). We notonly produce ER- and HER2-specific estimates of breast cancer survival in theabsence of screening and adjuvant treatment but we also estimate mean tumorvolume doubling time (TVDT) and mean mammographic detection threshold byER/HER2-status.RESULTS: In general, we found that tumors with ER-negative and HER2-positivestatus are associated with more aggressive growth, have lower TVDTs, are harderto detect by mammography, and have worse survival outcomes in the absence ofscreening and adjuvant treatment. Our estimates have been used as inputs intomodel-based analyses that evaluate the effects of screening and adjuvanttreatment interventions on population outcomes by ER and HER2 status developed bythe Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) Breast Cancer Working Group. In addition, our estimates enable a re-assessment of historicaltrends in breast cancer incidence and mortality in terms of contemporarymolecular tumor characteristics.CONCLUSION: Our approach can be generalized beyond breast cancer and to morecomplex molecular profiles.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X17743236 PMID: 29554464
