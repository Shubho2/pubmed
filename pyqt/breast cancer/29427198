[Epub ahead of print]Can the synthetic C view images be used in isolation for diagnosing breastmalignancy without reviewing the entire digital breast tomosynthesis data set?Murphy MC(1), Coffey L(2), O'Neill AC(2), Quinn C(2), Prichard R(2), McNallyS(2).Author information: (1)National Breast Screening Programme, Merrion Unit, St Vincent's UniversityHospital, Dublin 4, Ireland. mark.murphy@ucdconnect.ie.(2)National Breast Screening Programme, Merrion Unit, St Vincent's UniversityHospital, Dublin 4, Ireland.AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine if the synthetic Cview acquired at digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) would give adequateinformation to confirm a malignancy and could obviate the need to review all the tomosynthesis image data set.METHODS: All patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer recalled from screeningmammograms between May and September 2016 were included for review. For eachpatient, the screening 2D mammogram, the synthetic C view, and the DBT imageswere reviewed by three breast radiologists and each assigned a BIRADS code. Anydiscrepancies were reviewed and resolved by consensus.RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer in this timeperiod. Fourteen were excluded because they did not have DBT performed. Fivewomen were recalled for evaluation of two lesions. In total, 83 lesions wereassessed. In 27 cases, the BIRADS code remained unchanged in the threemodalities. In 16 cases, the lesions appeared more concerning on C view and DBTthat on the original mammogram but were not definitive for malignancy (BIRADS 4).In 29 cases, a BIRADS 5 code was assigned on C view and tomosynthesis but not on 2D. For 11 lesions, a BIRADS 5 code was assigned only on DBT. Four women hadBIRADS 5 lesions seen on both the C view and DBT that were not seen on thescreening 2D mammogram. One was multifocal.CONCLUSION: While the synthetic C view gives additional information when comparedto a screening 2D mammogram, the full DBT tomosynthesis data set needs to bereviewed to diagnose a breast malignancy.DOI: 10.1007/s11845-018-1748-7 PMID: 29427198
