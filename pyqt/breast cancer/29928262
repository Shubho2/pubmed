The suppressive effect of coffee constituents on the insulin-like growth factorreceptor 1 (IGF1R) levels in breast cancer cells may play a role. The aim was to investigate the prognostic impact of coffee consumption and possible associationswith tumor-specific IGF1R protein expression and BMI in a population-based cohortin Sweden, comprising 1,014 primary breast cancer patients without pretreatmentenrolled 2002-2012 and followed for up to 13 years. Patients with higher coffeeconsumption had lower tumor IGF1R levels (P = 0.025), but only among thenormal-weight patients (P = 0.005). Coffee did not impact the recurrence-riskoverall. However, tamoxifen-treated patients with ER+ tumors drinking ≥ 2 cups ofcoffee/day had lower recurrence-risk [adjusted HR (HRadj) 0.57, 95% CI,0.34-0.97] compared with patients with lower intake, although only amongnormal-weight patients (HRadj 0.37, 95% CI: 0.17-0.78; Pinteraction = 0.039).Similarly, coffee consumption ≥ 2 cups/day was associated with significantlylower recurrence-risk among the 640 radiotherapy-treated patients irrespective ofBMI (HRadj 0.59, 95% CI 0.36-0.98) and in the 296 normal-weight patients (HRadj0.36, 95% CI 0.17-0.76) but not in the 329 overweight or obese patients (HRadj0.88, 95% CI 0.42-1.82) although the interaction was not significant(Pinteraction = 0.093). In conclusion, coffee consumption was negativelyassociated with tumor-specific IGF1R levels only among normal-weight patients.Though, IGF1R did not explain the association between coffee intake and improved prognosis among normal-weight tamoxifen- or radiotherapy-treated patients.Studies of IGF1R-targeting therapies may benefit from taking BMI and coffeeconsumption into account.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00306 PMCID: PMC5997826PMID: 29928262
