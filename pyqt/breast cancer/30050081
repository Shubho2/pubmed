We have previously reported thatmiR-205-5p is upregulated in breast cancer stem cells targeting ERBB pathway and leading to targeted therapy resistance. Here we show that miR-205-5p regulatestumorigenic properties of breast cancer cells, as well as epithelial tomesenchymal transition. Silencing this miRNA in breast cancer results in reduced tumor growth and metastatic spreading in mouse models. Moreover, we show thatmiR-205-5p knock-down can be obtained with the use of specific locked nucleicacids oligonucleotides in vivo suggesting a future potential use of this approachin therapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0854-9 PMCID: PMC6062508PMID: 30050081
