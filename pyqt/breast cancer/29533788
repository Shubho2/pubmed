Microporous poly(ε-caprolactone) biomaterials have been shown to attractmetastasizing breast cancer cells in vivo early in tumor progression. In order toenhance the therapeutic potential of these scaffolds, they were modified suchthat infiltrating cells could be eliminated with non-invasive focal hyperthermia.Metal disks were incorporated into poly(ε-caprolactone) scaffolds to generateheat through electromagnetic induction by an oscillating magnetic field within a radiofrequency coil. Heat generation was modulated by varying the size of themetal disk, the strength of the magnetic field (at a fixed frequency), or thetype of metal. When implanted subcutaneously in mice, the modified scaffolds werebiocompatible and became properly integrated with the host tissue. Optimalparameters for in vivo heating were identified through a combination ofcomputational modeling and ex vivo characterization to both predict and verifyheat transfer dynamics and cell death kinetics during inductive heating. In vivo inductive heating of implanted, tissue-laden composite scaffolds led to tissuenecrosis as seen by histological analysis. The ability to thermally ablatecaptured cells non-invasively using biomaterial scaffolds has the potential toextend the application of focal thermal therapies to disseminated cancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
