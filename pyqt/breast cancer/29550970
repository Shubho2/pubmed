Sarah.Chadwell@cchmc.org.(3)Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH,USA.(4)Inherited Cancer, GeneDx, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.(5)Department of Surgery, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine,Cincinnati, OH, USA.Genetic testing for inherited cancer risk has recently improved through theadvent of multi-gene panels and the addition of deletion and duplication analysisof the BRCA genes. The primary aim of this study was to determine which factorsinfluence the intent of individuals with a personal history of breast and/orovarian cancer and negative or uncertain BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing to return to ahereditary cancer program for additional genetic risk assessment, counseling, andtesting. Surveys were sent to 1197 individuals and 257 were returned. Of thoseparticipants who were planning to return to clinic, most cited having familymembers who could benefit from the test result as the primary motivation toreturn. Many participants who were not planning to return to clinic cited thecost of testing as a barrier to return. Cost of testing and concerns aboutinsurance coverage were the most commonly cited barriers for the group ofparticipants who were undecided about returning to clinic. Results from thisstudy may be used to guide re-contact efforts by clinicians to increase patientuptake to return to clinic for up-to-date genetic risk assessment, counseling,and testing.DOI: 10.1007/s10897-018-0241-9 PMID: 29550970
