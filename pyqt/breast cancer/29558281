Horton, Duke UniversitySchool of Medicine, Durham, NC; and Alice Ho, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, LosAngeles, CA.Purpose Locoregional control for inflammatory breast cancers and chest wallrecurrences is suboptimal, which has motivated interest in radiosensitization to intensify therapy. Preclinical studies have suggested a favorable therapeuticindex when poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors are used as radiosensitizers; clinical investigation is necessary to establish appropriate dosing and confirmsafety. Patients and Methods We conducted a multi-institutional phase I study of veliparib and concurrent radiotherapy (RT) to the chest wall and regional lymphnodes in 30 patients with inflammatory or locally recurrent breast cancer aftercomplete surgical resection. RT consisted of 50 Gy to the chest wall and regionallymph nodes plus a 10-Gy boost. A Bayesian time-to-event continual reassessmentmethod escalated dose through four levels, with a 30% targeted rate ofdose-limiting toxicity (DLT) measured during the 6 weeks of treatment plus 4weeks of follow-up. DLTs were defined as confluent moist desquamation > 100 cm2, nonhematologic toxicity grade â‰¥ 3, toxicity that requires an RT dose delay > 1week, absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm3, platelet count < 50,000/mm3, orhemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL if possibly, probably, or definitely related to studytreatment. Results Five DLTs occurred: Four were moist desquamation (two each at 100 and 150 mg twice a day), and one was neutropenia (at 200 mg twice a day). Thecrude rate of any grade 3 toxicity (regardless of attribution) was 10% at year 1,16.7% at year 2, and 46.7% at year 3. At year 3, six of 15 surviving patients hadsevere fibrosis in the treatment field. Conclusion Although severe acute toxicitydid not exceed 30% even at the highest tested dose, nearly half of survivingpatients demonstrated grade 3 adverse events at 3 years, which underscores theimportance of long-term monitoring of toxicity in trials of radiosensitizingagents.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.77.2665 PMID: 29558281
