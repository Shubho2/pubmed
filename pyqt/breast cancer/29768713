The CYP and transporter cocktails consisted of caffeine/tolbutamide/omeprazole/dextromethorphan/midazolam used instudy 1 and digoxin/rosuvastatin used in study 2. In addition, repaglinide wasseparately administered to the same subjects in study 2. There were no majoreffects on the pharmacokinetics of CYP and transporter substrates, except for an approximate threefold increase in midazolam exposure after oral administration ofBFE1224. The clinical DDIs of BFE1224 were mild for CYP3A and minor for othermajor CYPs (CYP1A2/2C8/2C9/2C19/2D6) as well as those of P-glycoprotein (P-gp),breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporting polypeptide(OATP) 1B1, and OATP1B3.Â© 2018 The Authors.
