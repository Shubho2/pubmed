The aim of this study was to investigate theeffects of RAF and MEK concurrent inhibition on tumor growth, migration,signaling and apoptosis induction in preclinical models of non-V600 BRAF mutanttumor cell lines.METHODS: Six BRAF mutated human tumor cell lines CRL5885 (G466 V), WM3629(D594G), WM3670 (G469E), MDAMB231 (G464 V), CRL5922 (L597 V) and A375 (V600E ascontrol) were investigated. Pan-RAF inhibitor (sorafenib or AZ628) and MEKinhibitor (selumetinib) or their combination were used in in vitro viability,video microscopy, immunoblot, cell cycle and TUNEL assays. The in vivo effects ofthe drugs were assessed in an orthotopic NSG mouse breast cancer model.RESULTS: All cell lines showed a significant growth inhibition with synergism in the sorafenib/AZ628 and selumetinib combination. Combination treatment resultedin higher Erk1/2 inhibition and in increased induction of apoptosis when comparedto single agent treatments. However, single selumetinib treatment could causeadverse therapeutic effects, like increased cell migration in certain cells,selumetinib and sorafenib combination treatment lowered migratory capacity in allthe cell lines. Importantly, combination resulted in significantly increasedtumor growth inhibition in orthotropic xenografts of MDAMB231 cells when comparedto sorafenib - but not to selumetinib - treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that combined blocking of RAF and MEK may achieve increased therapeutic response in non-V600 BRAF mutant tumors.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4455-x PMCID: PMC5941622PMID: 29739364
