It ismaking use of carbon dots (C-dots) loaded with a DNA probe as fluorophore andMnO2 nanosheets as the quenching agent. The blue-green fluorescence of theDNA-loaded C-dots is quenched by the MnO2 nanosheets, but restored on bindingtarget microRNA-155. The maximum excitation wavelength and the maximum emissionwavelength of C-dots are at 360 nm and 455 nm, respectively. Fluorescencecorrelates linearly with the log of the microRNA-155 concentration in two ranges,viz. from 0.15 to 1.65 aM and from 1.65 to 20 aM. The detection limit is as lowas 0.1 aM. The assay can discriminate between fully complementary and single-basemismatch microRNA. The assay displayed high specificity when used to detect MCF-7breast cancer cells which can be detected in concentrations from 1000 to 45,000cells·mL-1, with a 600 cells·mL-1 detection limit. The method was applied to the analysis of serum samples spiked with microRNA, and satisfactory results wereacquired. Graphical abstract Schematic of a fluorometric sensing platform formiRNA-155. The method relies on a FRET process between C-dots and MnO2nanosheets. This strategy has a practical application for detection of miRNA incell lines and biological fluids.DOI: 10.1007/s00604-018-2868-5 PMID: 29995191
