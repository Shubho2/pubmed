Apreviously published and validated model was extended and adapted for thisanalysis. Two alternative scenarios were compared. In the care as usual pathwayfirst-line targeted treatment of MBC patients was assigned on the basis ofpathology results, while in the intervention pathway treatment selection wasbased on the results from the PET/CT imaging. Costs, life years gained (LYG) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated. More MBC lesionswere detected in the intervention pathway than in the care as usual pathway. The diagnostic costs to evaluate the receptor status and the treatment costs werehigher in the intervention strategy, as were total costs and total LYG. The ICER for replacing biopsies with PET/CT imaging with FES and 89Zr-trastuzumab,assuming sensitivity of 77.1% and specificity of 80%, ranged from €71,000 to€77,000 per LYG. When assuming sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 76.7%, theICER for replacing biopsies with PET/CT imaging with FES and 89Zr-trastuzumabranged from to €74,000 to €80,000 per LYG. The application of PET/CT with FES and89Zr-trastuzumab in first-line treatment selection for MBC patients has thepotential to be a cost-effective intervention. Our analysis demonstrated thateven a small increase in the sensitivity and the specificity of PET/CT can have alarge impact on its potential cost-effectiveness.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24869 PMCID: PMC5929430PMID: 29731987
