In this project,the breast cancer was transplanted in vivo with the TUBO cells. Then, thecancerous mice were treated by radiation of low frequency electromagnetic fields and injection of the Mn(II) complex of the N,N'-dipyridoxyl(1,2-diaminobenzene)Schiff base. Three different concentrations of the Mn(II) complex were used.Cytotoxicity and morphological alterations caused by the Mn(II) complex in theTUBO breast cancer cell line have been evaluated. Apoptotic properties of theMn(II) complex was studied using the flow cytometry. The Mn(II) complex has acytotoxic effect on cancer cells. Also, both of the Mn(II) complex and lowfrequency electromagnetic field induced apoptosis, which was confirmed by flowcytometry. Both of them result in considerable changes in the treated tissuessuch as decrease of the tumor mass, induction of apoptosis and decrease in numberof the blood vessels.Copyright © 2018.
