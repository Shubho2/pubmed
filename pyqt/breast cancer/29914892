Patients wererandomly divided into training (n = 194) and validation (n = 100) sets. Aradiomics signature (Rad-score) was generated using an elastic net in thetraining set, and the cutoff point of the radiomics signature to divide thepatients into high- and low-risk groups was determined using receiver-operatingcharacteristic curve analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportionalhazards model and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to determine the association ofthe radiomics signature, MRI findings, and clinicopathological variables withDFS. A radiomics nomogram combining the Rad-score and MRI and clinicopathologicalfindings was constructed to validate the radiomic signatures for individualizedDFS estimation.Results: Higher Rad-scores were significantly associated withworse DFS in both the training and validation sets (P = 0.002 and 0.036,respectively). The radiomics nomogram estimated DFS [C-index, 0.76; 95%confidence interval (CI); 0.74-0.77] better than the clinicopathological(C-index, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.70-0.74) or Rad-score-only nomograms (C-index, 0.67;95% CI, 0.65-0.69).Conclusions: The radiomics signature is an independentbiomarker for the estimation of DFS in patients with invasive breast cancer.Combining the radiomics nomogram improved individualized DFS estimation.
