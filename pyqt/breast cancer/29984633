It can be answered by using longitudinal follow-up data onrepeated rounds of screen, namely periodic screen, but such kind of data arerather complicated and fraught with intractable statistical properties including correlated multistate outcomes, unobserved and incomplete (censoring ortruncation) information, and imperfect measurements. We therefore developed anegative-binomial-family-based discrete-time stochastic process, takingsensitivity and specificity into account, to accommodate these thorny issues. Theestimation of parameters was implemented with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlomethod. We demonstrated how to apply this proposed negative-binomial-family-basedmodel to the empirical data similar to the Finnish breast cancer screeningprogram.DOI: 10.1177/0962280216682284 PMID: 29984633
