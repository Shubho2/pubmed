China.Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular A6 (EphA6) is a member of the Ephreceptor tyrosine kinase family, which has been implicated in tumorigenesis.However, little is known about the expression and function of EphA6 in breastcancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of EphA6and the possible association between EphA6 and clinicopathologicalcharacteristics in breast cancer. In the present study, EphA6 mRNA expression wasmeasured in 26 paired breast cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues byreverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, theprotein expression of EphA6 in breast cancer tissues from 116 patients wasexamined by immunohistochemistry, and the prognostic value for patients withbreast cancer was evaluated. The results of the present study indicated thatEphA6 mRNA and protein expression in breast cancer was significantly higher than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P<0.001). EphA6 overexpression wassignificantly associated with a high histological grade (P<0.001), overexpressionof human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2; P=0.0106), low estrogen receptorexpression (P=0.0247) and low progesterone receptor expression (P=0.0015).Furthermore, the increased expression of EphA6 was demonstrated to be associated with breast cancer subtypes (P=0.0164). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated thathigh EphA6 expression was associated with lower overall survival rates inpatients with breast cancer (P=0.015). Univariate and multivariate analysisrevealed that high EphA6 expression, Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification andsubtype were independent prognostic factors for patients with breast cancer (all P<0.05). In conclusion, EphA6 may serve an important role in breastcarcinogenesis and may pose as a novel prognostic indicator and therapeutictarget for breast cancer, particularly in patients with steroid receptor negativeexpression and HER-2 overexpression.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7919 PMCID: PMC5840743PMID: 29552165
