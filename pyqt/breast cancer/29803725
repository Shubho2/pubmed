Electronic address: sxlin@crchul.ulaval.ca.Steroid sulfatase is detectable in most hormone-dependent breast cancers. STX64, an STS inhibitor, induced tumor reduction in animal assay. Despite success inphase І clinical trial, the results of phase II trial were not that significant. Breast Cancer epithelial cells (MCF-7 and T47D) were treated with two STSinhibitors (STX64 and EM1913). Cell proliferation, cell cycle, and theconcentrations of estradiol and 5α-dihydrotestosterone were measured to determinethe endocrinological mechanism of sulfatase inhibition. Comparisons were madewith inhibitions of reductive 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17β-HSDs).Proliferation studies showed that DNA synthesis in cancer cells was modestlydecreased (approximately 20%), accompanied by an up to 6.5% in cells in the G0/G1phase and cyclin D1 expression reduction. The concentrations of estradiol and5α-dihydrotestosterone were decreased by 26% and 3% respectively. However,supplementation of 5α-dihydrotestosterone produced a significant increase(approximately 35.6%) in the anti-proliferative effect of sulfatase inhibition.This study has clarified sex-hormone control by sulfatase in BC, suggesting that the different roles of estradiol and 5α-dihydrotestosterone can lead to areduction in the effect of sulfatase inhibition when compared with 17β-HSD7inhibition. This suggests that combined treatment of sulfatase inhibitors with17β-HSD inhibitors such as the type7 inhibitor could hold promise forhormone-dependent breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
