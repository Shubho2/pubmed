ShcA (SHC1) is one suchadaptor protein that employs two phospho-tyrosine binding domains (PTB and SH2)and key phospho-tyrosine residues to promote mammary tumorigenesis. Receptortyrosine kinases (RTK), such as ErbB2, bind the ShcA PTB domain to promote breasttumorigenesis by engaging Grb2 downstream of the ShcA tyrosine phosphorylationsites to activate AKT/mTOR signaling. However, breast tumors also rely on theShcA PTB domain to bind numerous negative regulators that limit activation ofsecondary mitogenic signaling networks. This study examines the role ofPTB-independent ShcA pools in controlling breast tumor growth and resistance totyrosine kinase inhibitors. We demonstrate that PTB-independent ShcA complexespredominately rely on the ShcA SH2 domain to activate multiple Src family kinases(SFK), including Src and Fyn, in ErbB2-positive breast cancers. Using genetic andpharmacologic approaches, we show that PTB-independent ShcA complexes augmentmammary tumorigenesis by increasing the activity of the Src and Fyn tyrosinekinases in an SH2-dependent manner. This bifurcation of signaling complexes from distinct ShcA pools transduces non-redundant signals that integrate the AKT/mTOR and SFK pathways to cooperatively increase breast tumor growth and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including lapatinib and PP2. This studymechanistically dissects how the interplay between diverse intracellular ShcAcomplexes impacts the tyrosine kinome to affect breasttumorigenesis.Implications: The ShcA adaptor, within distinct signalingcomplexes, impacts tyrosine kinase signaling, breast tumor growth, and resistanceto tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
