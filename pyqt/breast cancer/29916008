Recent data demonstrate that PMRTreduces distant metastases (DM) in women with pN1 disease. The challenge today iswhether all patients with pathologic T1-2pN1 disease have similar substantialLRF/DM risk that routinely warrants PMRT.METHODS: We reviewed patients with pT1-2N1 breast cancer treated withmast. ± adjuvant systemic therapy without PMRT from 2000 to 2013. The endpointswere LRF and DM rates, estimated by cumulative incidence method.RESULTS: We identified 468 patients with median follow-up of 6.3 years. Most(71%) were estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor + human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (HER2). There were 269 patients with 1+ node, 140 patients with2+ nodes, and 59 patients with 3+ nodes. The 6-year LRF/DM rates were 4.1%/8.4%. Patients with 1+, 2+, and 3+ nodes had 6-year LRF of 2.3, 5.1 and 8.9%,respectively (p = 0.13). The 6-year DM rate was higher in patients with 3+ nodes versus 1-2+ nodes: 15.7% versus 7.4% (p = 0.02). Several subgroups had low 6-yearLRF and DM rates, including T1/1+ node (0.8%/4.1% LRF/DM) and micrometastases(0%/5.8% LRF/DM).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pT1-2pN1 represent a heterogeneous group with a widerange of LRF/DM rates. In particular, patients with pT1 tumors and 1 + LN, andpatients with micrometastases, had low event rates. These groups would derivesmall absolute reductions in LRF and DM with addition of PMRT, underscoring theimportance of patient selection for PMRT in pT1-2pN1 breast cancer.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6565-8 PMID: 29916008
