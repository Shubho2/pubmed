However, how SFs form in response to the mechanicalinteraction of cells with their environment is not fully understood. Here we haveidentified Piezo2 mechanosensitive cationic channel as a transducer ofenvironmental physical cues into mechanobiological responses. Piezo2 is needed bybrain metastatic cells from breast cancer (MDA-MB-231-BrM2) to probe theirphysical environment as they anchor and pull on their surroundings or whenconfronted with confined migration through narrow pores. Piezo2-mediated Ca2+influx activates RhoA to control the formation and orientation of SFs and focaladhesions (FAs). A possible mechanism for the Piezo2-mediated activation of RhoA involves the recruitment of the Fyn kinase to the cell leading edge as well ascalpain activation. Knockdown of Piezo2 in BrM2 cells alters SFs, FAs, andnuclear translocation of YAP; a phenotype rescued by overexpression ofdominant-positive RhoA or its downstream effector, mDia1. Consequently, hallmarksof cancer invasion and metastasis related to RhoA, actin cytoskeleton, and/orforce transmission, such as migration, extracellular matrix degradation, andSerpin B2 secretion, were reduced in cells lacking Piezo2.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1718177115 PMCID: PMC5828612 [Available on 2018-08-20]PMID: 29432180  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
