In orderto elucidate the role of ISL1 in breast cancer, we performed quantitativereal-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis, and we foundthat ISL1 was upregulated in breast cancer cells and tissues. Moreover, highexpression of ISL1 was correlated with tumor size, metastasis, and poorprognosis. Colony formation analysis and CCK-8 analysis revealed that ISL1facilitated breast cancer cell proliferation. In addition, wound healing analysisand transwell invasion analysis demonstrated that ISL1 played a role in cellmigration and invasion. Interestingly, the expression of ISL1 was also associatedwith the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in breastcancer, and ISL1 promoted angiogenesis in breast cancer. In conclusion, reducing the expression of ISL1 suppresses proliferation, migration, invasion, andangiogenesis in breast cancer, suggesting that ISL1 might serve as a novelmolecular therapy target in breast cancer.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S144241 PMCID: PMC5818873PMID: 29497310
