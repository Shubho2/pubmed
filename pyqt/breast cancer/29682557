In this study,we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to generate the cutoffpoint of AFU for overall survival (OS). The prognostic influence of the AFU levelin serum on OS was studied using Kaplan-Meier curves. Moreover, invasion assaysand Western blotting were performed to explore the effects of AFU on iCCAinvasion in vitro. We found that higher AFU levels (≥20.85 U/L) weresignificantly associated with favorable median OS (44.3 months versus 20.1months; P = 0.022) in iCCA patients. Cox regression models' analyses showed that the AFU level was an independent predictor for OS (P = 0.006). Moreover, ourresults revealed that the AFU could impair the invasion capability of the iCCAcells, HuH28, and also downregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2and matrix metalloproteinase 9. In conclusion, our results indicate that AFU is asignificantly favorable prognostic factor in iCCA patients.DOI: 10.1155/2018/8182575 PMCID: PMC5842738PMID: 29682557
