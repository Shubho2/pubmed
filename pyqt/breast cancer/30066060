Here, we re-evaluatedER-negative/PgR-positive (ER-/PgR+) carcinoma cases by immunohistochemicalstaining (IHC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected patients who underwent surgery for primarybreast carcinoma from our databases at Dokkyo Medical University Hospital andKameda General Hospital. Among the 9844 patients, the largest series in Japan, 27(0.3%) were initially diagnosed as ER-/PgR+ breast carcinomas and we re-evaluatedby IHC.RESULTS: The re-evaluated IHC showed that of the 27 patients with the initialresults of ER-/PgR+, 12 were ER+/PgR+, 8 were ER-/PgR-, and 7 were ER-/PgR+. ERwas negative in 12 of 27 patients (44.4%), and PgR was positive in 8 of 27patients (29.6%). In our seven re-evaluated and confirmed as ER-/PgR+ cases, the staining proportions of tumor cells were 0% in ER and 1-69% (average 15.8%) inPgR. The average staining proportion of PgR in the re-evaluated ER-/PgR+phenotype was lower than the initial diagnosis. Histological grading was asfollows: grade I, one case; grade II, two cases; grade III, four cases. Therewere two lymph-node-positive cases.CONCLUSIONS: The ER-/PgR+ phenotype was confirmed after re-evaluation of ER andPgR assessment by a different pathologist. We recommend that pathologists discusswith clinicians, or re-test and re-evaluate ER/PgR expression, particularly inlow-grade carcinoma and with a high staining proportion of PgR in the ER-/PgR+phenotype.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0898-9 PMID: 30066060
