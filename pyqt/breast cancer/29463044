While both genomic and non-genomic tumor cell promoting mechanisms of estrogen signaling are well characterized in multiple carcinomas includingbreast, ovarian, and lung, recent investigations have identified a potentialimmune regulatory role of estrogens in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor immunetolerance is a well-established mediator of oncogenesis, with increasing evidenceindicating the importance of the immune response in tumor progression.Immune-based therapies such as antibodies that block checkpoint signals haveemerged as exciting therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment, offering durableremissions and prolonged survival. However, only a subset of patients demonstrateclinical response to these agents, prompting efforts to elucidate additionalimmunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment. Evidence drawnfrom multiple cancer types, including carcinomas traditionally classified asnon-immunogenic, implicate estrogen as a potential mediator of immunosuppression through modulation of protumor responses independent of direct activity on tumor cells. Herein, we review the interplay between estrogen and the tumormicroenvironment and the clinical implications of endocrine therapy as a noveltreatment strategy within immuno-oncology.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19020611 PMCID: PMC5855833PMID: 29463044
