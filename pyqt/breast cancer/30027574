[Epub ahead of print]Ambra1 Modulates the Sensitivity of Breast Cancer Cells to Epirubicin byRegulating Autophagy via ATG12.Sun WL(1), Wang L(1), Luo J(1), Zhu HW(1), Cai ZW(1).Author information: (1)Department of Medical Oncology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of GuangxiMedical University, No. 166 Daxuedonglu Road, Nanning, 530007, Guangxi, P. R.China.The sensitivity of breast cancer cells to epirubicin (EPI) is closely related to the efficacy of the drug and the prognosis of patients. A growing body ofresearch has suggested that autophagy is involved in the treatment of a varietyof cancer, including breast cancer, and modifies the sensitivity of anti-cancerdrugs. However, the mechanism by which autophagy participates in cancer therapyand modulates drug sensitivity has not been fully elucidated. In this study, weshowed that the expression of Autophagy/Beclin 1 regulator 1 (Ambra1), a keyprotein of autophagy, was negatively correlated with EPI sensitivity in breastcancer cells. In addition, it altered the sensitivity of breast cancer cells toEPI by regulating EPI-induced autophagy. As a potential mechanism, wedemonstrated that autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12) was a downstream proteinthat Ambra1 regulated EPI-induced autophagy. Therefore, Ambra1 plays an importantrole in regulating the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to EPI. And theregulatory effect of Ambra1 on EPI sensitivity is achieved through the regulationof autophagy by targeting ATG12. Overall, we propose a novel mechanism by whichautophagy modulates the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to EPI. And ATG12 is anovel targeting protein of Ambra1 in regulating EPI-induced autophagy. Inaddition, the important role of Ambra1 in modulating the sensitivity of breastcancer cells to EPI is confirmed in vivo. Additionally, this finding indicatesthat Ambra1 might be a target for developing breast cancer treatments. Thisarticle is protected by copyright.
