This study aimed to explore the properties of EVsderived from breast cancer (BC) cells following exposure to high- or low-dosechemotherapeutic agents and evaluate thrombogenic effects of these EVs onendothelial cells (ECs).METHODS:  EVs were isolated from BC cell lines (non-metastatic MCF7,high-metastatic MDA-MB-231), pre-exposed to serum-free medium (control), with or without increasing doses of doxorubicin or paclitaxel. EV structure and size werestudied using electron microscopy and Nano-sight. Antigen levels were measured byfluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). EV effects on EC thrombogenicity wereassessed using FACS, factor Xa chromogenic assay and RT-PCR.RESULTS:  Serum-free medium BC cell resulted in EV shedding that additionallyincreased when MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed to high doses of both agents. Tissuefactor (TF) levels were similarly low (9-13%) in all EVs compared with the highexpression on their parental MDA-MB-231 cells (76-83%). EVs derived fromMDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with high-dose doxorubicin demonstrated significantly(fivefold; p < 0.001) elevated levels of negatively charged phospholipids, a 97% decrease in TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI) levels and a sixfold increase (p < 0.001)in procoagulant activity. These EVs also enhanced EC thrombogenicity. Effects of EVs originating from MCF7 cells were less pronounced.CONCLUSION:  These findings suggest that thrombogenic properties of BC-derivedEVs may depend on the type and dose of the applied chemotherapy agent and mayalso be affected by the cell metastatic nature.Schattauer GmbH Stuttgart.DOI: 10.1055/s-0038-1629901 PMID: 29490409
