ER transcriptional potential is mediated, in large part, by the specific associated proteins and co-factors that interact with it.Despite the identification and characterisation of several ER coregulators, acomplete and systematic view of ER-regulating chromatin modifiers is lacking. By exploiting a focused siRNA screen that investigated the requirement for a libraryof 330 chromatin regulators in ER-mediated cell growth, we find that the NuRD andcoREST histone deacetylation complexes are critical for breast cancer cellproliferation. Further, by proteomic and genomics approaches, we discover thetranscription factor TRPS1 to be a key interactor of the NuRD and coRESTcomplexes. Interestingly, TRPS1 gene amplification occurs in 28% of human breast tumours and is associated with poor prognosis. We propose that TRPS1 is required to repress spurious binding of ER, where it contributes to the removal of histoneacetylation. Our data suggest that TRPS1 is an important ER-associatedtranscriptional repressor that regulates cell proliferation, chromatinacetylation and ER binding at the chromatin of cis-regulatory elements.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0312-2 PMID: 29895970
