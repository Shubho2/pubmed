However, there are no datacomparing PECs with the popular practice of continuous local anaesthetic woundinfusion (LA infusion) analgesia for breast surgery. Therefore, we compared theefficacy and safety of PECs blocks with LA infusion, or a combination of both in patients undergoing non-ambulatory breast-cancer surgery.METHODS: This single-centre, prospective, randomised, double-blind trial analysed45 women to receive either PECs blocks [levobupivacaine 0.25%, 10 ml PECs I andlevobupivacaine 0.25%, 20 ml PECs II (PECs group); LA infusion catheter(levobupivacaine 0.1% at 10 ml h-1 for 24 h (LA infusion group); or both (PECsand LA infusion)]. The primary outcome measure was area under the curve of thepain verbal rating score whilst moving vs time (AUC) over 24 h. Secondaryoutcomes included total opioid consumption at 24 h.RESULTS: AUC moving was mean (SD) 71 (34) mm h-1vs 58 (41) vs 23 (20) in PECs, LAinfusion, and both, respectively; P=0.002. AUC at rest was also significantlylower in patients receiving both. The total 24 h opioid consumption [median(25-75%)] was 14 mg (9-26) vs 11 (8-24) vs 9 (5-11); P=0.4. No adverse eventswere observed.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of both pre-incisional PECs blocks and postoperativeLA infusion provides better analgesia over 24 h than either technique alone afternon-ambulatory breast-cancer surgery.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 03024697.Copyright © 2018 British Journal of Anaesthesia.
