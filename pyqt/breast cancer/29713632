One of its components is a deviant energetic metabolism, known as Warburg effect-an aerobic lactatogenesis-characterized by elevated rates of glucoseuptake and consumption with high-lactate production even in the presence ofoxygen. Because many cancer cells display a greater sensitivity to glucosedeprivation-induced cytotoxicity than normal cells, inhibitors of glucosecellular uptake (facilitative glucose transporter 1 inhibitors) and oxidativemetabolism (glycolysis inhibitors) are potential therapeutic targets in cancertreatment. Polyphenols, abundantly contained in fruits and vegetables, aredietary components with an established protective role against cancer. Severalmolecular mechanisms are involved in the anticancer effect of polyphenols,including effects on apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, plasma membrane receptors,signaling pathways, and epigenetic mechanisms. Additionally, inhibition ofglucose cellular uptake and metabolism in cancer cell lines has been describedfor several polyphenols, and this effect was shown to be associated with theiranticarcinogenic effect. This work will review data showing an antimetaboliceffect of polyphenols and its involvement in the chemopreventive/chemotherapeuticpotential of these dietary compounds, in relation to breast cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fnut.2018.00025 PMCID: PMC5911477PMID: 29713632
