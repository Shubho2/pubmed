Thetwo groups had similar patient characteristics. The FP group had significantlypoorer PFS than the non-FP group (multivariate hazard ratio [HR] 1.33; 95%confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.73; p = 0.036), although the OS did not differsignificantly between the groups (multivariate HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.67-1.50;p = 0.994). With different cut-off values (relapse-free interval [RFI] = 3, 4,and 5 years), multivariate HRs for PFS were 1.32-1.67 (short RFI), and 1.00-1.25 (long RFI). A trend for a larger HR in the FP group compared to the non-FP group with short RFI than in that with long RFI was also seen for OS. Response rate(RR) and disease control rate (DCR) did not differ significantly between thegroups (RR in FP vs non-FP 13.8 vs 21.0%; p = 0.173; DCR 54.0 vs 59.9%;p = 0.418). No significant difference in AEs existed between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Extra caution is needed when capecitabine is considered for patientswith ABC who used perioperative FP, especially those who had early recurrence.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3617-5 PMCID: PMC6060805PMID: 29872875
