CTCs were again assessed after the first 2 yearsof endocrine treatment. In addition, safety data were compared between the 2groups.RESULTS: The 2 groups were well-balanced with regard to baseline characteristics.The CTC clearance rate after 2 years was 89% in the exemestane-only group and 97%in the tamoxifen-exemestane group (exact Fisher test, p = 0.36). The safetyprofile showed good tolerability with few grade 3 or 4 adverse events in bothgroups.CONCLUSION: The similar CTC clearance rate after 2 years of endocrine therapywith exemestane or tamoxifen, and the safety profiles obtained may indicatecomparable efficacy and tolerability of both endocrine treatment regimens.However, these results have to be confirmed by final survival and safetyanalysis.© 2018 S.
