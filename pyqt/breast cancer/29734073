The deviceutilizes two sets of planar interdigitated transducer electrodes micropatternedon top of a glass wafer using standard microfabrication techniques. Amicrochannel with a single inlet and two outlets, realized inpolydimethylsiloxane, is bonded on the glass substrate. The two sets ofelectrodes slightly protrude into the microchannel. Both of the electrode setsare energized with signals at different frequencies and different operatingvoltages ensuring that the cancer cells experience positive dielectrophoreticforce from one set of the electrodes and negative dielectrophoretic force fromthe other array. Normal cells experience unequal negative dielectrophoreticforces from opposing sets of electrodes. The resultant dielectrophoretic forceson cancer and normal cells push them to flow towards their designed outlets.Successful isolation of green fluorescent protein-labelled MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells from regular blood cells, both suspended in a sucrose/dextrosemedium, is reported in this work.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
