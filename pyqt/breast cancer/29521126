For its efficient treatment, Lapatinib (LAPA) was developed as a selectivetyrosine kinase inhibitor of receptors, overexpressed by breast cancer cells.Various explored delivery strategies for LAPA indicated its controlled releasewith enhanced aqueous solubility, improved bioavailability, decreased plasmaprotein binding, reduced dose and toxicity to the other organs with maximizedclinical efficacy, compared to its marketed tablet formulation. Areas covered:This comprehensive review deals with the survey, performed through differentelectronic databases, regarding various challenges and their solutions attainedby fabricating delivery systems like nanoparticles, micelle, nanocapsules,nanochannels, and liposomes. It also covers the synthesis of novelLAPA-conjugates for diagnostic purpose. Expert opinion: Unfortunately, clinicaluse of LAPA is restricted because of its extensive albumin binding capacity, poororal bioavailability, and poor aqueous solubility. LAPA is marketed as the oraltablet only. Therefore, it becomes imperative to formulate alternate efficientmultiparticulate or nano-delivery systems for administration through non-oralroutes, for active/passive targeting, and to scale-up by pharmaceuticalscientists followed by their clinical trials by clinical experts. LAPAcombinations with capecitabine and letrozole should also be tried for breastcancer treatment.DOI: 10.1080/17425247.2018.1449832 PMID: 29521126
