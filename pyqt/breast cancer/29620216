Mitochondria have been reported to be a vulnerability of CSCs by multiple studies. Here, we report that doxycycline,functioning as an inhibitor of mitochondrial biogenesis, can effectively targetbreast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Our results revealed that doxycyclinesignificantly decreased the frequency of aldehyde dehydrogenase‑positive (ALDH+) BCSCs as well as mammosphere formation efficiency in HER2+ and triple‑negativebreast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. Doxycycline also ameliorated paclitaxel‑inducedenrichment of ALDH+ BCSCs in TNBC. Mechanistically, we showed that doxycyclinedecreased the level of reactive oxygen species and their downstream p38 MAPKpathway. In agreement with the key role for p38 in maintaining BCSCs, a specific inhibitor targeting this MAPK pathway significantly decreased the number of ALDH+cells. Doxycycline is a FDA‑approved drug with minor and limited side‑effects.Given doxycycline's low toxicity and strong effect on BCSC inhibition, we report that doxycycline should be safe to be used concomitantly with chemotherapy drugs to eradicate both CSCs and bulk tumor cells.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6337 PMID: 29620216
