[Epub ahead ofprint]Combination treatment of cancer cells with pan-Akt and pan-mTOR inhibitors:effects on cell cycle distribution, p-Akt expression level andradiolabelled-choline incorporation.Phyu SM(1), Smith TAD(2)(3).Author information: (1)School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, University of Aberdeen,Aberdeen, AB25 2ZD, UK.(2)School of Medicine, Medical Sciences and Nutrition, University of Aberdeen,Aberdeen, AB25 2ZD, UK. t.smith@abdn.ac.uk.(3)Biomedical Physics Building, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill, Aberdeen,AB25 2ZD, UK. t.smith@abdn.ac.uk.Signal transduction pathways, which regulate cell growth and survival, areup-regulated in many cancers and there is considerable interest in theirpharmaceutical modulation for cancer treatment. However inhibitors of singlepathway components induce feedback mechanisms that overcome the growth moderatingeffect of the inhibitor. Combination treatments have been proposed to provide amore complete pathway inhibition. Here the effect of dual treatment of cancercells with a pan-Akt and a pan-mTOR inhibitor was explored. Breast (SKBr3 andMDA-MB-468) and colorectal (HCT8) cancer cells were treated with the pan-Aktinhibitor MK2206 and pan-mTOR inhibitor AZD8055. Cytotoxic effect of the twodrugs were determined using the MTT assay and the Combination Index andisobolomic analysis used to determine the nature of the interaction of the twodrugs. Flow cytometry and western blot were employed to demonstrate drug effects on cell cycle distribution and phosph-Aktser473 expression. Radiolabelled([methyl-3H]) Choline uptake was measured in control and drug-treated cells todetermine the modulatory effects of the drugs on choline incorporation. The twodrugs acted synergistically to inhibit the growth rate of each cancer cell line. Flow cytometry demonstrated G0/G1 blockade with MK2206 and AZD8055 which wasgreater when cells were treated with both drugs. The incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline was found be decreased to a greater extent in cells treated with bothdrugs compared with cells treated with either drug alone. Conclusions Pan-mTORand pan-Akt inhibition may be highly effective in cancer treatment and measuring changes in choline uptake could be useful in detecting efficacious drugcombinations.DOI: 10.1007/s10637-018-0642-5 PMID: 30056610
