Electronic address: kimberly.ray@ucsf.edu.(2)Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California, San Francisco, 1600 Divisadero Street, Room C250, San Francisco, CA 94115, USA.Breast MR imaging has been shown to identify unsuspected sites of cancer in theipsilateral breast in 16% of women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Breast MR imaging identifies occult cancer in the contralateral breast in 3% to 5% ofwomen. Early evidence suggests that the added value of MR imaging for staging maybe attenuated in women who also undergo tomosynthesis, particularly those withnondense breasts. Breast MR imaging is complementary to ultrasound imaging inevaluating regional nodal basins. Ongoing prospective randomized clinical trials should clarify the impact of preoperative breast MR imaging on clinical outcomes.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.
