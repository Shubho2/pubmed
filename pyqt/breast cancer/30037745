Breast cancercells were treated at 43°C and 45°C, with or without doxorubicin. Cell viability,apoptosis, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated inMDA-MB-231 and SUM-1315 cells. Nude mice breast cancer models were randomlydivided into control, MWA, doxorubicin, and combined treatment groups. Tumorapoptosis and DNA damage were evaluated in these groups.RESULTS: The combined group had lower cell viability than the heat or doxorubicingroup (all P<0.05), and enhanced apoptosis rate was observed in the combinedgroup compared to others (all P<0.01) in MDA-MB-231 and SUM-1315. Increasedcapase3 (all P<0.01) and decreased Bcl-Xl (all P<0.01) were detected aftercombined therapy compared to single treated group in vitro. The raisedCaspase3and DNA damage marker histone H2A.X induced by combined treatment were alsoapproved in the nude mice models. Combined treatment promoted ROS generationcompared to doxorubicin or MWA treatment (all P < 0.01). NF-κB expression in the combined group was higher than that of the single treatment group (all P<0.05).N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, partly restrained the combined treatmentinduced cell proliferation inhibition, Caspase3 and NF-κB compared to doxorubicintreatment (all P<0.05).CONCLUSION: MWA combined with doxorubicin promote cell death via ROS induced cellapoptosis and DNA damage. Increasing ROS has potential for improving theefficiency of combined treatment.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.DOI: 10.1016/j.diii.2018.06.004 PMID: 30037745
