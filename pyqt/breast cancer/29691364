Tooptimize interventions targeting those unscreened, a better understanding isneeded of how this preventive service fits in with multiple preventive andchronic care needs managed by primary care providers (PCPs). This study examines whether PCP practices of other preventive and chronic care needs correlate withCRC screening.METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 90 PCPs and 33,137 CRCscreening-eligible patients. Five PCP quality metrics (breast cancer screening,cervical cancer screening, HgbA1c and LDL testing, and blood pressure control)were measured. A baseline correlation test was performed between these metricsand PCP CRC screening rates. Multivariable logistic regression with clustering atthe clinic-level estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for these PCPquality metrics, patient and PCP characteristics, and their relationship to CRCscreening.RESULTS: PCP CRC screening rates have a strong correlation with breast cancerscreening rates (r = 0.7414, p < 0.001) and a weak correlation with the otherquality metrics. In the final adjusted model, the only PCP quality metric thatsignificantly predicted CRC screening was breast cancer screening (OR 1.25; 95%CI 1.11-1.42; p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: PCP CRC screening rates are highly concordant with breast cancerscreening. CRC screening is weakly concordant with cervical cancer screening and chronic disease management metrics. Efforts targeting PCPs to increase CRCscreening rates could be bundled with breast cancer screening improvementinterventions to increase their impact and success.DOI: 10.1038/s41424-018-0014-7 PMCID: PMC5915383PMID: 29691364
