In patients presenting an early-stage breast tumordevoid of clinically pathological lymph node, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsyhas not yet been validated as a routine procedure for pregnant women due to thelack of data in the literature. The blue dye injection is not recommended becauseof 2% theoretical risk of anaphylactic shock. Several studies have shown thatTc99m injection at conventional dose between 12.1 and 18.5MBq exposed the fetusto an irradiation between 0.011 and 0.0245mSv much below the 50mSv recommendedthreshold. As evidenced by lymphoscintigraphy scans, the dose of injected Tc99mis localized at the injection site and in the SLN. According to the literature,the SLN technique does not seem to impact the fetal or obstetrical prognosis.Studies involving larger cohorts are required to confirm these data and toindicate this technique in pregnant women. Considering the benefit for thepatient and the low risk incurred on both fetal and obstetrical levels, itappears reasonable to discuss the indication of SLN on a case-by-case basis inmultidisciplinary oncologic meetings.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
