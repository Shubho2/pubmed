However, the pathophysiology was unknown.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 60-year-old female presented with bilateral blurred visiondue to cystoid macular edema after taking 12-course paclitaxel for her breastcancer. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (FAG),indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), electroretinogram (ERG) andelectrooculogram (EOG) were performed.DIAGNOSES: Paclitaxel-induced macular edema.INTERVENTIONS: Paclitaxel was discontinued and supportive treatment withpentoxifylline was given.OUTCOMES: The OCT showed bilateral cystoid macular edema. Impaired filling ofchoriocapillaries was noted on the ICGA; while EOG revealed decreased Ardenratio. The visual acuity, cystoid macular edema and decreased Arden ratioimproved slowly over six months.LESSONS: Paclitaxel rarely causes cystoid macular edema. The damage ofchoriocapillaries and retinal pigment epithelium might be the underlying cause.Immediate discontinuation of the drug helps visual recovery.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011229 PMCID: PMC6039693PMID: 29952984  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
