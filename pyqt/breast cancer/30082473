Prostate canceris among the most heritable cancers, but few studies have investigated itsassociation with familial breast cancer. The objective of this study is toinvestigate the extent to which familial breast or prostate cancer infirst-degree relatives increases prostate cancer risk.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A prospective study of 37,002 U.S. men in the HealthProfessionals Follow-up Study. During 16-year follow-up to 2012, 4,208 total and 344 lethal cases were diagnosed. Using cause-specific hazards regression, weestimated multivariable hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between familial breast or prostate cancer and total and lethalprostate cancer.RESULTS: Those with familial breast cancer had a 21% greater risk of prostatecancer overall (95% CI 1.10-1.34), and a 34% greater risk of lethal disease (HR1.34; 95% CI 0.96-1.89). Family history of prostate cancer alone was associatedwith a 68% increased risk of total disease (95% CI 1.53-1.83) and a 72% increasedrisk of lethal disease (95% CI 1.25-2.38). Men with a family history of bothcancers were also at elevated risk.CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that men with a family history of breast or prostatecancer had elevated prostate cancer risks, including risk of lethal disease.These findings have translational relevance for cancer risk prediction in men.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0370 PMID: 30082473
