Interventions took place in HIV clinics in Chicago, IL and Birmingham, AL. Participants self-reportedHIV-related stigma and social support at baseline, after workshop, and at 4follow-up visits over 12 months.RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-nine participants (UNITY n = 124; breast cancereducation n = 115) were assessed over 1 year. Both arms experienced decreases in mean stigma scores over time. Our model estimated that allocation to UNITY wasnot associated with a significant difference in stigma points over time. Post hocanalysis suggested that preceding increases in perceived social support areassociated with decreased HIV-related stigma in this population.CONCLUSIONS: Although UNITY did not significantly reduce HIV-related stigma inthis population, our findings suggest that social support may be key toHIV-related stigma reduction.DOI: 10.1097/QAI.0000000000001673 PMCID: PMC5997522 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29528941
