T2DM and GDM may influencebreast cancer risk through mammographic breast density, a strong risk factor for breast cancer. We examined whether T2DM and GDM are associated with highermammographic breast density in a largely racial/ethnic minority sample.METHODS: We collected digital mammograms, anthropometric measures, and interview data from 511 racially diverse women recruited during screening mammographyappointments between 2012 and 2016 (mean age 51 years; 70% Hispanic). We examinedthe associations of self-reported GDM, T2DM, and medication use (metformin andinsulin) with mammographic breast density, measured as percent and area of dense tissue using Cumulus software.RESULTS: In multivariable linear regression models, history of T2DM and/or GDMand length of time since diagnosis were not associated with percent density ordense breast area, either before or after adjustment for current BMI. Use ofmetformin in diabetic women was associated with lower percent density(β = - 5.73, 95% CI - 10.27, - 1.19), only before adjusting for BMI. Theseassociations were not modified by menopausal status.CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support associations between T2DM and/or GDM and higher amount of mammographically dense breast tissue, suggesting that themechanism linking diabetes with breast cancer risk may not include mammographicbreast density in midlife.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1048-6 PMID: 29948515
