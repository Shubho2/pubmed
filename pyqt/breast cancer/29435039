China.The database of BRCA1/2 mutations in Chinese population remains incomplete atpresent. Therefore, the present study aimed to report specific harmful BRCA1/2mutations in the Chinese population and discuss the clinicopathological features in mutation carriers. BRCA1/2 germline mutation tests for 71 patients with breastcancer from a hereditarily high-risk Chinese population were performed usingnext-generation sequencing for identification of deleterious mutations.Furthermore, the clinicopathological features between BRCA1/2 mutation carriersand non-carriers were compared. A total of 13/71 (18.3%) patients carried a BRCA1or BRCA2 mutation (7 BRCA1 and 6 BRCA2). The incidence of BRCA1/2 mutation inpatients with bilateral breast cancer and patients with family history were 25,and 32.2%, respectively. Eleven pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations wereidentified in 13 patients, among the mutation sites 7 were never reported before in Asian populations. The age at diagnosis of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers was oldercompared with non-mutation carriers (44.73 vs. 35.39 years; P=0.001) in thiscohort. BRCA1/2 deleterious mutation carriers had a significantly lower chance ofhuman epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her-2) positive status (P=0.010),higher tumor grade at diagnosis (P=0.009), higher probability to have a familyhistory (P=0.016) and older age at diagnosis. Estrogen receptor (ER) andprogesterone receptor (PR) status were significantly different between BRCA1, andBRCA2 mutation carriers (P=0.007). The current interpretation of BRCA1/2 statuscan only explain a small part of hereditary high-risk breast cancer. However,BRCA1/2 gene testing should still be recommended for women with a family history of breast cancer, as well as patients with breast cancer with specific pathologictypes, which may be useful to make appropriate clinical decisions for treatmentand prevention.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7717 PMCID: PMC5778890PMID: 29435039
