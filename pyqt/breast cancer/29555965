We have recently demonstrated that the single amino acid polymorphismHLA-DPÎ²84Gly (DP84Gly) is critical to abrogate class II invariant chainassociated peptide (CLIP) region-mediated binding of invariant chain (Ii) to DP, allowing endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident endogenous antigens toconstitutively associate with DP84Gly such as DP4. In this study, we demonstrate that both the CLIP and N-terminal non-CLIP Ii regions cooperatively generate anIi conformation that cannot associate with DP84Gly via the CLIP region. We alsodemonstrate the ability of DP4 to efficiently process and present antigensencoded in place of CLIP in a chimeric Ii, regardless of wild type Ii and HLA-DM expression. These data highlight the complex interplay between DP polymorphismsand the multiple Ii regions that cooperatively regulate this association,ultimately controlling the presentation of endogenous antigens on DP molecules.These results may also offer a mechanistic explanation for recent studiesidentifying the differential effects between DP84Gly and DP84Asp as clinicallyrelevant in human disease.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22931-4 PMCID: PMC5859192PMID: 29555965
