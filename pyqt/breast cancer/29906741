Electronic address: H.vanLaarhoven@amc.uva.nl.OBJECTIVE: Group medical consultations (GMCs) provide individual medical visitsin the presence of ≤7 peer-patients. In the follow-up of breast cancer, weevaluated the efficacy of a new type of blended care My-GMC, a GMC combined with a tablet-based online app, consisting of three online support group sessions(SGS) and additional information.METHODS: This randomized controlled trial compared the effect of My-GMC (n = 59) with one individual medical visit (n = 50) (care as usual). Between-groupdifferences on the outcomes distress and empowerment were analyzed 1 week, 3 and 6 months after the visit.RESULTS: No between-group differences were found for the primary outcomesdistress and empowerment. More themes were discussed in GMCs compared toindividual visits. Significantly more patients experienced peer-support in GMCs(78%) than via the online app (29%). Satisfaction with the online app was low.CONCLUSIONS: My-GMC did not result in improvements in distress or empowerment,which might partly be explained by low baseline distress levels. This paperprovides valuable information concerning factors on organizational level as well as individual level influencing the evaluation of a blended care intervention.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: My-GMC provided an innovative alternative, combiningprofessional and peer-support in face-to-face and online SGS, resulting inadditional information provision and peer-support. Further improvement of theapps is needed to improve user satisfaction.NETHERLANDS TRIAL REGISTER: NTR3771.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
