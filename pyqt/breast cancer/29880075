Sixty healthy controls were tested atequivalent intervals. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to compare the BC andcontrol groups in terms of accuracy, mean reaction time, and intraindividualvariability in reaction time on a computerized continuous performance test withthree conditions: a simple reaction time task, a "1-back" task, and a "2-back"task.RESULTS: An increase in accuracy and response speed over sessions was noted onsome tasks in the sample as a whole but there were no differences in theseparameters between the BC patients and the controls on any condition. There was asignificant group difference in change in intraindividual variability acrosssessions (i.e., a "group Ã— session interaction"), albeit only on the most complex"2-back" task. Intraindividual variability declined in the control group (i.e.,consistency improved with practice) but this practice effect was significantlyattenuated in the BC patients. There was no main effect of group on the "2-back" task.CONCLUSIONS: Results support our hypothesis that intraindividual variability is amore sensitive indicator of subtle cognitive disturbance than conventional speed or accuracy measures and may have potential in the assessment of mild cognitiveimpairment in patients with non-central nervous system cancers.
