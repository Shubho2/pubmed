Ofthese, 80-90% are correleted with the Hereditary Breast-Ovarian Cancer Syndrome(HBOC), which is linked to BRCA 1/2 genes mutations. Our study was set up tostudy the BRCA-mutation incidence in Apulian population affected with ovariancancer and to understand the characteristics of the ovarian diseaseBRCAmut-related.Results: One hundred and five Apulian patients affected by ovarian cancer withserous high grade histotype, were collected. Of these, 39% were carriers of BRCA 1/2 mutation. BRCAmut patients present a lower median age of onset, a lowerpercentage of neoplasms in advanced stages and a lower mortality than wild typepatients; BRCA-mutated patients have longer mean values of Progression FreeSurvival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS).Conclusions: Apulia is a geographical area with a significant BRCA-mutationincidence variation in the population affected by ovarian cancer. BRCAmut-relatedovarian disease is characterized by an earlier median age of onset, an earlierdiagnosis and a better outcome than the sporadic disease.Materials and Methods: From July 2015 to October 2017, all ovarian cancerpatients with serous high grade histotype referred to our Institution wereprospectly collected. A BRCA-mutation genetic testing after counselling wasoffered to all of these patients. Clinical characteristics of all ovarian cancer patients were evaluated. Survival curves were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methodand compared with log-rank test.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24959 PMCID: PMC5976469PMID: 29854283
