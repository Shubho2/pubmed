Several new clinical and technological developments in the last decadewarrant special consideration due to their impact on pathology practice.Methods: This review covers the SLN biopsy procedure, issues in thehistopathologic and molecular diagnosis of the SLN, and most importantly,evidence from recent practice-changing clinical trials.Results: ACOSOG Z0011, IBCSG 23-01, and AMAROS trials have shown that early-stagebreast cancer patients who have limited metastatic involvement of the SLNs do notbenefit from completion axillary dissections.Conclusions: It is not necessary for pathologists to search for all smallmetastases to predict non-SLN involvement, regional recurrence, or death due todisease. Processing should be designed with the goal of detectingmacrometastases. Multiple levels, routine immunohistochemistry, and moleculartesting are not recommended.DOI: 10.1093/ajcp/aqy024 PMID: 29746624
