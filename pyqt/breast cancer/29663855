Thus, it is potentially relevant to assess breast cancerdevelopment. We propose the use of second-harmonic generation images of tumorstroma selected on hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides to evaluate theprognostic value of collagen fibers analyses in peri and intratumoral areas inpatients diagnosed with invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Quantitative analysesof collagen parameters were performed using ImageJ software. These parameterspresented significantly higher values in peri than in intratumoral areas. Higher intratumoral collagen uniformity was associated with high pathological stages andwith the presence of axillary lymph node metastasis. In patients withimmunohistochemistry-based luminal subtype, higher intratumoral collagenuniformity and quantity were independently associated with poorer relapse-freeand overall survival, respectively. A multivariate response recursivepartitioning model determined 12.857 and 11.894 as the best cut-offs forintratumoral collagen quantity and uniformity, respectively. These values haveshown high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate distinct outcomes. Valuesof intratumoral collagen quantity and uniformity exceeding the cut-offs werestrongly associated with poorer relapse-free and overall survival. Our findingssupport a promising prognostic value of quantitative evaluation of intratumoralcollagen by second-harmonic generation imaging mainly in the luminal subtypebreast cancer.DOI: 10.1177/1010428318770953 PMID: 29663855  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
