Several studies have reported that high FDG uptake is predictive of poor prognosis and aggressive features inpatients with breast cancer. FDG uptake is influenced by many factors, including inflammation. In this study, the relationship between FDG uptake andneutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which is an indicator of systemicinflammation, was investigated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective investigation of the cases of 143consecutive patients with invasive ductal carcinoma who had undergone surgery andFDG-PET preoperatively. PET was evaluated using standardized uptake value max(SUVmax). The median SUVmax was 2.5 (range=0-10.5). The cases were divided intotwo groups based on the value of SUVmax: low (<2.5) and high (≥2.5). Therelationships between SUVmax and clinicopathological features, including NLR,were investigated.RESULTS: Among the 143 patients, 73 (51.0%) had high SUVmax in the primary tumor.The analysis revealed that large tumor size (p<0.001), high nuclear grade(p<0.001), the presence of lymphovascular invasion (p<0.001), high C-reactiveprotein (p=0.046) and high NLR (p<0.001) were significantly associated with high SUVmax in the primary tumor. SUVmax and NLR were significantly positivelycorrelated (r=0.323, p<0.001). Among the 70 cases with low SUVmax, there was norecurrent disease, while out of the 73 cases with high SUVmax had diseaserecurrence. It is interesting to note that the group with high SUVmax and low NLRhad no recurrent disease.CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that the finding of high preoperative FDG uptake in breast cancer may be reflective of poor prognosis and that a highNLR may be predictive of aggressive features among patients with breast cancer.On the other hand, among patients with breast cancer with high SUVmax in theprimary tumor, it will be useful to identify those with a low NLR in order toimprove prognostic accuracy.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12809 PMID: 30061271  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
