[Epub ahead of print]Sensitivity of Initial Thoracentesis for Malignant Pleural Effusion Stratified byTumor Type in Patients with Strong Evidence of Metastatic Disease.Grosu HB(1), Kazzaz F(2), Vakil E(1), Molina S(1), Ost D(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson CancerCenter, Houston, Texas, USA.(2)Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.BACKGROUND: Thoracentesis with cytological examination of pleural fluid is theinitial test of choice for evaluation of pleural effusions in patients withsuspected malignant pleural effusion (MPE). There is limited data on thesensitivity of thoracentesis stratified by tumor type. A better understanding of stratified sensitivities is of clinical interest, and may guide early andappropriate referral for pleural biopsy.OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was sensitivity of thoracentesis with pleuralfluid cytology stratified by tumor type.METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with asolid tumor malignancy with proven or strong suspicion for metastatic diseasewith new pleural effusions that underwent an initial thoracentesis. Only patientswith metastatic disease were included.RESULTS: Of the 725 patients examined, 63% had pleural fluid cytology positivefor malignancy. Sensitivity of thoracentesis varied from a low of 0.38 (95% CI0.13-0.68) in head and neck malignancy, 0.38 (95% CI 0.15-0.65) in sarcoma, and0.53 (95% CI 0.34-0.72) in renal cancer to a high of 93 (95% CI 88-97) in breast cancer, and 100 (95% CI 0.82-100) in pancreatic cancer. Factors associated withan increased risk of MPE included larger amount of fluid drained (p = 0.014) and higher pleural fluid protein (p = 0.002). The only factor associated withdecreased risk of MPE if first cytology was negative for malignancy was thepresence of contralateral effusion (p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity of thoracentesis for solid tumors varies significantlydepending on the type of tumor and is lowest in those with sarcomas, head andneck malignancies, and renal cell cancers.Â© 2018 S.
