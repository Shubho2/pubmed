After writteninformed consent was obtained, 144 females (age > 40 years) who were recalled to the assessment clinic were recruited into TACT. These cases (48 cancers) wererandomly allocated for blinded review of (1) DM workup and (2) DBT, both inconjunction with previous DM from the screening examination. Fifteen radiologistsof varying experience levels in the Australia BreastScreen Program were included in this study, wherein each radiologist read 48 cases (16 cancers) in 3non-overlapping blocks. Diagnostic accuracy was measured by means of sensitivity,specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV). Thereceiver-operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) was calculated todetermine radiologists' performances.RESULTS: Use of DBT (AUC = 0.927) led to improved performance of the radiologists(z = 2.62, p = 0.008) compared with mammography workup (AUC = 0.872). Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of DBT (0.93, 0.75, 0.64, 0.96) werehigher than those of the workup (0.90, 0.56, 0.49, 0.92). Most radiologists (80%)performed better with DBT than standard workup. Cancerous lesions on DBT appearedmore severe (U = 33,172, p = 0.02) and conspicuous (U = 24,207, p = 0.02). There was a significant reduction in the need for additional views (χ2 = 17.63, p <0.001) and recommendations for ultrasound (χ2 = 8.56, p = 0.003) with DBT.CONCLUSIONS: DBT has the potential to increase diagnostic accuracy and simplifythe assessment process in the breast cancer assessment clinic.KEY POINTS: • Use of DBT in the assessment clinic results in increased diagnosticaccuracy. • Use of DBT in the assessment clinic improves performance ofradiologists and also increases the confidence in their decisions. • DBT mayreduce the need for additional views, ultrasound imaging, and biopsy.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5473-4 PMID: 29846804
