Itis therefore important to understand the mechanisms underlying breast cancerdevelopment as well as raises the need for enhanced, non-invasive strategies for novel prognostic and diagnostic methods. The emergence of long non-coding RNAs(lncRNAs) as potential key players in neoplastic disease has receivedconsiderable attention over the past few years. This relatively new class ofmolecular regulators has been shown from ongoing research to act as criticalplayers for key biological processes. Deregulated expression levels of lncRNAshave been observed in a number of cancers including breast cancer. Furthermore,lncRNAs have been linked to breast cancer initiation, progression, metastases andto limit sensitivity to certain targeted therapeutics. In this review we provide an update on the lncRNAs associated with breast cancer and mammary glanddevelopment and illustrate the versatility of such lncRNAs in gene control,differentiation and development both in normal physiological conditions and indiseased states. We also highlight the therapeutic and diagnostic potential oflncRNAs in cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24591 PMCID: PMC5929455PMID: 29732012
