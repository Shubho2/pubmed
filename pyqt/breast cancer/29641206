Epub2018 Apr 11.Estrogen Receptor (ER) Subtype Selectivity Identifies 8-Prenylapigenin as an ERβ Agonist from Glycyrrhiza inflata and Highlights the Importance of Chemical andBiological Authentication.Hajirahimkhan A, Mbachu O, Simmler C, Ellis SG, Dong H, Nikolic D, Lankin DC, vanBreemen RB, Chen SN, Pauli GF, Dietz BM, Bolton JL.Postmenopausal women are increasingly using botanicals for menopausal symptomrelief due to the increased breast cancer risk associated with traditionalestrogen therapy. The deleterious effects of estrogens are associated withestrogen receptor (ER)α-dependent proliferation, while ERβ activation couldenhance safety by opposing ERα effects. Three medicinal licorice species,Glycyrrhiza glabra ( G. glabra), G. uralensis, and G. inflata, were studied fortheir differential estrogenic efficacy. The data showed higher estrogenic potencyfor G. inflata in an alkaline phosphatase induction assay in Ishikawa cells (ERα)and an estrogen responsive element (ERE)-luciferase assay in MDA-MB-231/β41breast cancer cells (ERβ). Bioassay-guided fractionation of G. inflata led to theisolation of 8-prenylapigenin (3). Surprisingly, a commercial batch of 3 wasdevoid of estrogenic activity. Quality control by MS and qNMR revealed anincorrect compound, 4'- O-methylbroussochalcone B (10), illustrating theimportance of both structural and purity verification prior to any biologicalinvestigations. Authentic and pure 3 displayed 14-fold preferential ERβ agonistactivity. Quantitative analyses revealed that 3 was 33 times more concentrated inG. inflata compared to the other medicinal licorice extracts. These data suggest that standardization of G. inflata to 3 might enhance the safety and efficacy of G. inflata supplements used for postmenopausal women's health.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b01070 PMCID: PMC5928484PMID: 29641206
