Electronic address:Fiona.young@flinders.edu.au.The detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescindiacetate (DCFDA) is commonly performed by a single measurement of fluorescencebut this fails to capture a profile of ROS generation over time. This study aimedto develop a real-time monitoring method to increase the utility of the assay, toincorporate cytotoxicity screening and to describe the combined effects of DCFDA and the ROS generator, Ter-butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP). Breast cancer MCF-7cells were loaded with DCFDA (0-50 μM) for 45 min, and then exposed to TBHP(0-50 μM). Fluorescence was recorded according to three different schedules:every hour for 6 h, or once after 6 h or 24 h. Viability was assessed in acrystal violet assay and cell morphology was examined by microscopy. TBHP caused a time and dose-dependent increase in ROS and the magnitude of the fluorescentsignal was affected by the loading concentration of DCFDA. Reading thefluorescence every hour for 6 h did not diminish the emission signal. The mostsensitive and reliable combination for this ROS assay was 10 μM DCFDA with 25 μM TBHP; since higher concentrations of DCFDA compromised cell viability. Inconclusion we adapted a single point ROS assay to enable production of a profile of ROS generation over an extended 6 h period, and related this to cell viabilityand morphology.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.vascn.2018.03.007 PMID: 29630935
