A generic anastrozole tablet was developed to offer an alternative to the marketed tablet formulation. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the bioequivalence between the test and reference formulations ofanastrozole in a single-dose, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover study with a 14-day washout interval. A total of 20 healthy male Chinese volunteers were enrolled andcompleted the study, after oral administration of a single dose of 1.0-mg testand reference formulations of anastrozole. The blood samples were collected atdifferent times and were determined by a fully validated high-pressure liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. The evaluated pharmacokineticparameters, including Cmax , AUC0-t , and AUC0-∞ , were assessed forbioequivalence based on current guidelines. The observed pharmacokineticparameters of anastrozole of the test drug were similar to those of the referenceformulation. The 90% confidence intervals of test/reference ratios for Cmax ,AUC0-t , and AUC0-∞ were within the bioequivalence acceptance range of 80%-125%. The results obtained from these healthy Chinese subjects in this study suggestthat the test formulation of anastrozole 1.0-mg tablet is bioequivalent to thereference formulation (Arimidex 1.0-mg tablet).© 2018, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.DOI: 10.1002/cpdd.450 PMID: 29659187
