China.X‑box‑binding protein 1 (XBP1) contributes to various types of cancer includingbreast, bladder cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The aim of thestudy was to examine the metastatic role of XBP1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and identify possible downstream molecules. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted on tissue microarrays comprising 96 OSCC cases to determine theexpression level of XBP1 and analyze its association with metastasis,clinicopathological characteristics and survival prognosis. Compared with theadjacent normal tissues of OSCC, the expression of XBP1 was significantlyincreased in the tumor center and front area, and lymph nodes metastases(P<0.05). A relatively high XBP1 expression was associated with histologicalgrades (P<0.05), advanced clinical stages (P<0.05), unfavorable 5‑year survival(P=0.027). Suppressed XBP1 expression caused a significant reduction of cellinvasion capability (P<0.05). AXL and the downstream molecules, such as PI3K,MMP1, MMP3, and uPA were significantly suppressed when XBP1 expression wasinhibited in OSCC cells. Once XBP1 was activated by Thapsigargin, AXL expression was restored. Moreover, aberrant AXL expression was associated with XBP1overexpression in OSCC tissues (P<0.05). In conclusion, XBP1 is a potentialtarget that is relevant to suppressing cell invasion and is associated withpatient prognosis in OSCC.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6498 PMID: 29916547
