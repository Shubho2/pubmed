However, theirintrinsic properties require expensive computation during training. This paperpresents a novel algorithm to SpikeProp for SNN by introducing smoothing L1∕2regularization term into the error function. This algorithm makes the networkstructure sparse, with some smaller weights that can be eventually removed.Meanwhile, the convergence of this algorithm is proved under some reasonableconditions. The proposed algorithms have been tested for the convergence speed,the convergence rate and the generalization on the classical XOR-problem, Irisproblem and Wisconsin Breast Cancer classification.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
