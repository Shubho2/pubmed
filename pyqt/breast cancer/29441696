Participants were recruited from a comprehensive cancer center of apublic hospital in Shandong Province, China. The principal caregivers completedthe Shortened Chinese Version of the Family Resilience Assessment Scale and theChinese Version of the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview; patients completed theShort Form of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and questions designed to obtainsociodemographic information. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted toassess the adjusted association between family resilience and PTG and caregiverburden, while controlling for sociodemographics.RESULTS: Families showed a slightly elevated level of family resilience since thecancer experience, and patients showed a moderate degree of PTG. Principalcaregivers reported moderate burden. The Shortened Chinese Version of the Family Resilience Assessment Scale total score was positively related to the Short Form of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory total score (β = .28, P < .01) and wasnegatively related to Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview total score (β = -.28,P < .01).CONCLUSIONS: Family resilience impacts PTG of breast cancer survivors andcaregiver burden. Our findings indicated the necessity of interventions tofacilitate family resilience, promote PTG among breast cancer survivors, anddecrease family members' caregiver burden.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4668 PMID: 29441696
