Recent researches had found that circRNAscould function as microRNA sponges, regulators of gene transcription and encodingproteins. They were relatively stable and expressed widely in cytoplasm, whichplayed important roles in carcinogenesis of cancers, such as esophageal cancer,gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocarcinoma, bladder cancer, glioma,breast cancer, osteosarcoma and so on. Furthermore, they were involved in manybiological functions, like cell proliferation, drug resistance, cell cycle,invasion and metastasis. Therefore, the further studies were meaningful on themechanism of cancers and circRNAs. In the review, we will summarize the currentbiogenesis of circRNAs and the roles of them in various cancers, which might be anovel biomarker and therapeutic avenue.PMCID: PMC6038087PMID: 30018701
