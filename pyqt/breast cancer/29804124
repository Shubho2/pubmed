Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) wasused to investigate the exact mechanisms. RESULTS FGF5 expression wassignificantly upregulated in BC patients relative to that in normal controls(P<0.0001). BC patients in the FGF5 low-expression group were correlated withbetter clinical characteristics, including tumor size, histopathological grading,estrogen receptors, clinical risk group according to St Gallen criteria, NPIcriteria and Veridex signature, DMFS, TDM, and DFS compared with those in theFGF5 high-expression cohort. The result of GSEA indicated that FGF5 inhibits the proliferation of BC cells via ultraviolet response and TGF-b signaling.Quantitative PCR verified that FGF5 was overexpressed in patients with BC.CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that FGF5 is an independent protective factor forBC patients.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.907798 PMCID: PMC5998728PMID: 29804124
