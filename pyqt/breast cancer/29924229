Patients withlighter skin phototypes (I, II and III) had a lower risk (p=0.045) of developing skin changes when compared to darker phototypes. Radiation therapy (p=0.011) and oncological surgery (pFisher=0.004) were statistically significant when relatedto skin changes.STUDY LIMITATIONS: Inherent to the design of the study, as well as recall bias.CONCLUSIONS: It was found that most patients diagnosed with breast cancer showed dermatologic manifestations during the proposed cancer treatment. Patientsundergoing radiotherapy and surgery showed skin changes with greater statistical significance.DOI: 10.1590/abd1806-4841.20186541 PMCID: PMC6001084PMID: 29924229  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
