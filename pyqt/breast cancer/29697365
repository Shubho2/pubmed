Using the model,we analyzed the mutation profiles of 1954 tumor specimens across eight tumortypes.RESULTS: As a result, we identified tumor type-specific directed networkscomposed of 2-15 cancer-related genes (nodes) and their mutational orders(edges). The most common ancestors identified in pairwise comparison of somaticmutations were TP53 mutations in breast, head/neck, and lung cancers. The knownrelationship of KRAS to TP53 mutations in colorectal cancers was identified, aswell as potential ancestors of TP53 mutation such as NOTCH1, EGFR, and PTENmutations in head/neck, lung and endometrial cancers, respectively. We alsoidentified apoptosis-related genes enriched with ancestor mutations in lungcancers and a relationship between APC hotspot mutations and TP53 mutations incolorectal cancers.CONCLUSION: While evolutionary analysis of cancers has focused on clonal versussubclonal mutations identified in individual genomes, our analysis aims tofurther discriminate ancestor versus descendant mutations in population-scalemutation profiles that may help select cancer drivers with clinical relevance.DOI: 10.1186/s12920-018-0352-z PMCID: PMC5918460PMID: 29697365
