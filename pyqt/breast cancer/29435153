The tumor microenvironment (TME) isshaped by direct interactions among cancer cells, cancer-associated cells and theextracellular matrix (ECM). Recognizing the need to incorporate both tissuedimensionality and the heterogeneity of cells, we have developed a 3D breastcancer model. NIH3T3 fibroblasts and EMT6 breast cancer cell lines were seeded invarious ratios onto a silk fibroin scaffold. The porosity of the silk scaffoldwas optimized to facilitate the growth of cancer cells. EMT6 and NIH3T3 cellswere modified to express GFP and turboFP635, respectively, which enabled thedirect analysis of the cell morphology and colonization of the scaffold and forthe separation of the cells after their co-culture. Use of 3D mono-culture and 3Dco-culture methods resulted in the modification of cell morphology and in asignificant increase in ECM production. These culture methods also inducedcellular changes related to EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and CAF(cancer-associated fibroblast) markers. The presented model is an easy tomanufacture, well-characterized tool that can be used to study processes of theTME.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23574 PMCID: PMC5797024PMID: 29435153
