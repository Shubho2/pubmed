It is important to identify compound(s) capable of disrupting themetastasis of invasive cancer cells, especially for hindering invadopodiaformation, so as to provide anti-metastasis targeted therapy. Invadopodia arethought to be specialized actin-rich protrusions formed by highly invasive cancercells to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM). A curcuminoid analogue known as 2,6-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidine)cyclohexanone or BHMC has shown goodpotential in inhibiting inflammation and hyperalgesia. It also possesses ananti-tumor effects on 4T1 murine breast cancer cells in vivo. However, there isstill a lack of empirical evidence on how BHMC works in preventing human breastcancer invasion. In this study, we investigated the effect of BHMC on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and its underlying mechanism of action to prevent breastcancer invasion, especially during the formation of invadopodia. All MDA-MB-231cells, which were exposed to the non-cytotoxic concentrations of BHMC, expressed the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which indicate that theanti-proliferative effects of BHMC did not interfere in the subsequentexperiments. By using a scratch migration assay, transwell migration and invasionassays, we determined that BHMC reduces the percentage of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. The gelatin degradation assay showed that BHMC reduced thenumber of cells with invadopodia. Analysis of the proteins involved in theinvasion showed that there is a significant reduction in the expressions of Rhoguanine nucleotide exchange factor 7 (β-PIX), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9),and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) in the presence of BHMCtreatment at 12.5 µM. Therefore, it can be postulated that BHMC at 12.5 µM is theoptimal concentration for preventing breast cancer invasion.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23040865 PMID: 29642589
