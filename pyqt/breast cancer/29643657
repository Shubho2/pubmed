Ltd., Guwahati, Assam, India.Context: Cytological changes in terms of shape and size of nuclei are some of thecommon morphometric features to study breast cancer, which can be observed bycareful screening of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) images.Aims: This study attempts to categorize a collection of FNAC microscopic imagesinto benign and malignant classes based on family of probability distributionusing some morphometric features of cell nuclei.Materials and Methods: For this study, features namely area, perimeter,eccentricity, compactness, and circularity of cell nuclei were extracted fromFNAC images of both benign and malignant samples using an image processingtechnique. All experiments were performed on a generated FNAC image databasecontaining 564 malignant (cancerous) and 693 benign (noncancerous) cell levelimages. The five-set extracted features were reduced to three-set (area,perimeter, and circularity) based on the mean statistic. Finally, the data werefitted to the generalized Pearsonian system of frequency curve, so that theresulting distribution can be used as a statistical model. Pearsonian system is afamily of distributions where kappa (κ) is the selection criteria computed asfunctions of the first four central moments.Results and Conclusions: For the benign group, kappa (κ) corresponding to area,perimeter, and circularity was -0.00004, 0.0000, and 0.04155 and for malignantgroup it was 1016942, 0.01464, and -0.3213, respectively. Thus, the family ofdistribution related to these features for the benign and malignant group weredifferent, and therefore, characterization of their probability curve will alsobe different.DOI: 10.4103/JOC.JOC_198_16 PMCID: PMC5885612PMID: 29643657
