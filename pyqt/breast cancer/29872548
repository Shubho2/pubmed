Themain tumor type was pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (14/36, 38.9%) and DCIS with micro- or minimal invasion (11/36, 30.6%). Among the 25 DCIS, histologicgrade was high in 15 (60.0%) and intermediate in nine (36%); comedo necrosis was seen in 17 (68%). Immunohistochemical analysis was available in 27 lesions andshowed HER2-overexpression in 12 (44.4%) and triple-negative in two (7.4%).Conclusion: According to our limited patient sample, NMCs on breast US weremainly associated with high-grade DCIS.DOI: 10.1177/2058460118774957 PMCID: PMC5977436PMID: 29872548
