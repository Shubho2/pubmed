Clinical attempts tostimulate this apoptotic pathway for cancer therapy, including the use ofrecombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) or receptor agonistic antibodies, have beenunderway for over a decade. Unfortunately, these agents have only shown limitedtherapeutic effects due largely to tumor resistance arising from mechanisms yetto be defined. Here we show that intermediate filament proteins, keratin 8 andkeratin 18 (K8/K18), negatively regulate TRAIL induced apoptosis. K8/K18 protein levels are consistently higher in TRAIL-resistant cells compared toTRAIL-sensitive cells in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Blockade of K8increased expression of DR5 on the surface of targeted cells and sensitized thecells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Conversely, ectopic expression of K8/K18downregulated DR5 protein expression. K8/K18 appears to negatively regulateapoptosis signaling via DR5 in breast cancer cells. Our findings warrantadditional studies to determine if K8/K18 could be a predictor of tumorresistance to DR5-targeted therapies.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25297 PMCID: PMC5955420PMID: 29796187
