China.Recent research has shown that TOP2A plays an important role in the tumorigenesisof many malignancies, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer.However, few studies have been conducted on TOP2A expression and functions incolon cancer. In the present study, we found that TOP2A expression was obviously elevated in colon cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues.Depletion of TOP2A in HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cells by transfection ofspecific small interfering RNA significantly suppressed proliferation andinhibited invasion of cells, even induced apoptosis as indicated by both MTTassay, Annexin V/propidium iodide staining, and Transwell assay. Furthermore, we explored the underlying mechanisms. Knockdown of TOP2A not only affects theexpression of cell apoptosis-related (Bcl-2 and Bax) and invasion-relatedproteins (MMP-2 and MMP-9), but also reduced the phosphorylation levels of ERKand AKT. In conclusion, we showed that TOP2A was upregulated in colon cancertissue samples and that TOP2A may serve as an oncogene in colon cancer.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcb.26916 PMID: 29761838
