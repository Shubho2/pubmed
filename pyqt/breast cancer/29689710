PIK3CA exon 9 and exon 20 mutations in plasma cfDNAwere found in 3 and 7 out of the 33 patients, respectively; PIK3CA exon9 mutations in serum cfDNA were detected in 2 out of 3 patients with PIK3CA exon 9 mutations in plasma cfDNA; PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in serum cfDNA weredetected in 2 out of 7 patients with PIK3CA exon 20 mutations in plasma cfDNA.CONCLUSIONS: Here we show the higher frequency of ESR1 and PIK3CA mutations inthe plasma than in the serum in 33 MBC patients; therefore, serum samples should not be considered the preferred source of cfDNA.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-171161 PMID: 29689710
