DUOX1 is frequently downregulated in lung and liver cancers,suggesting a tumor suppressor role for this enzyme. Here, we show that DUOX1expression is decreased in breast cancer cell lines and also in breast cancerswhen compared to the nontumor counterpart. In order to address the role of DUOX1 in breast cells, we stably knocked down the expression of DUOX1 in nontumormammary cells (MCF12A) with shRNA. This led to higher cell proliferation ratesand decreased migration and adhesion properties, which are typical features fortransformed cells. After genotoxic stress induced by doxorubicin, DUOX1-silenced cells showed reduced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion and increased apoptosis levels.Furthermore, the cell proliferation rate was higher in DUOX1-silenced cells afterdoxorubicin medication in comparison to control cells. In conclusion, wedemonstrate here that DUOX1 is silenced in breast cancer, which seems to beinvolved in breast carcinogenesis.DOI: 10.1155/2018/3570526 PMCID: PMC5933011PMID: 29849884
