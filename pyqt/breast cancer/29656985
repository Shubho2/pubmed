However, the molecular mechanism of telocinobufagin, a compoundextracted from ChanSu, on breast cancer cells has not been clarified. The aim of this study is to investigate the underlying mechanism of telocinobufagin onbreast cancer cells.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The differentially expressed genes after telocinobufagintreatment on breast cancer cells were searched and downloaded from GeneExpression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress and literatures. Bioinformatics tools wereapplied to further explore the potential mechanism of telocinobufagin in breastcancer using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway, Geneontology (GO) enrichment, panther, and protein-protein interaction analyses. Tobetter comprehend the role of telocinobufagin in breast cancer, we also queriedthe Connectivity Map using the gene expression profiles of telocinobufagintreatment.RESULTS: One GEO accession (GSE85871) provided 1251 differentially expressedgenes after telocinobufagin treatment on MCF-7 cells. The pathway of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), intestinal immunenetwork for IgA production, hematopoietic cell lineage and calcium signalingpathway were the key pathways from KEGG analysis. IGF1 and KSR1, owning to higherprotein levels in breast cancer tissues, IGF1 and KSR1 could be the hub genesrelated to telocinobufagin treatment. It was indicated that the molecularmechanism of telocinobufagin resembled that of fenspiride.CONCLUSIONS: Telocinobufagin might regulate neuroactive ligand-receptorinteraction pathway to exert its influences in breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and itsmolecular mechanism might share some similarities with fenspiride. This studyonly presented a comprehensive picture of the role of telocinobufagin in breastcancer MCF-7 cells using big data. However, more thorough and deeper researchesare required to add to the validity of this study.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.prp.2018.03.029 PMID: 29656985
