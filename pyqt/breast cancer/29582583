Indocyanine green (ICG) can convert NIR light energy tolocalized heat for cancer cell and tissue ablation. However, the effect ofautophagy modulation on ICG-mediated photothermal therapy remains unknown. Inthis study, it is found that primaquine (PQ) suppresses autophagy flux at a late stage through the impeding fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome to form an autophagolysosome, leading to cell apoptosis or necrosis. Thisautophagosome-lysosome fusion inhibitory effect and the autophagosomeaccumulation are more evident in the photothermal therapy combined with autophagyinhibition. Motivated by this notable effect, a cascade-targeting nanocapsule(HCP) is constructed using an organic solvent-free strategy to coencapsulate PQand ICG. By targeting the cluster designation 44 molecule and sequentiallyenhancing the cell-penetrating peptide-mediated endocytosis, the codelivery ofPQ/ICG by HCP achieves selective recognition and reinforces the internalizationby MCF-7 cells to exert a synergistic therapeutic effect on MCF-7 cells both invitro and in vivo. The HCP system for the photothermal and autophagy inhibitioncombination therapy represents a novel strategy for the treatment of breastcancer.Â© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
