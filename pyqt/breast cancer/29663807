R. China.Multidrug resistance (MDR), as one of the main problems in clinical breast cancerchemotherapy, is closely related with the over expression of drug effluxtransporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In this study, a novel drug-loaded nanosystem was developed for inhibiting the P-gp expression and reversing MDR by multiplexedgene silencing, which composes of graphene oxide (GO) modified with two molecularbeacons (MBs) and Doxorubicin (Dox). When the nanosystem was uptaken by the MDRbreast cancer cells, Dox was released in the acidic endosomes and MBs werehybridized with target sequences. The intracellular multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1)mRNA and upstream erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS1) mRNA canbe silenced by MBs, which can effectively inhibit the expression of P-gp andfurther prevent the efflux of Dox and reverse MDR. In vitro and in vivo studiesindicated that the strategy of reversing MDR by multiplexed gene silencing could obviously increase MCF-7/Adr cells' Dox accumulation and enormously enhance thetherapeutic efficacy of MDR breast cancer chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b02800 PMID: 29663807
