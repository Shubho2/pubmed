Now whether iron chelation depletesintracellular iron and/or disrupts intracellular iron homeostasis is yet to befully addressed. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with increasingconcentrations of the iron chelator deferoxamine were assessed for intracellular iron status, the expression of key proteins involved in iron metabolism, cellviability, growth potential, and apoptosis at different time points followingtreatment. Treatment with deferoxamine at 1, 5, or 10 μM for 24 or 48 hours,while not leading to significant changes in intracellular labile iron content,upregulated the expression of hepcidin, ferroportin, and transferrin receptors 1 and 2. In contrast, deferoxamine at 30, 100, or 300 μM for 24 hours induced asignificant decrease in intracellular labile iron, which was associated withincreased expression of hepcidin, ferritin, and transferrin receptors 1 and 2. At48 hours, there was an increase in intracellular labile iron, which wasassociated with a significant reduction in hepcidin and ferritin expression and asignificant increase in ferroportin expression. Although low-dose deferoxaminetreatment resulted in a low to moderate decrease in MCF-7 cell growth, high-dose treatment resulted in a significant and precipitous decrease in cell viabilityand growth, which was associated with increased expression of phosphorylatedHistone 2A family member X and near absence of survivin. High-dose deferoxaminetreatment also resulted in a very pronounced reduction in wound healing andgrowth in MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings suggest that high-dose deferoxaminetreatment disrupts intracellular iron homeostasis, reduces cell viability andgrowth, and enhances apoptosis in breast cancer cells. This is further evidenceto the potential utility of iron chelation as an adjunctive therapy iniron-overloaded cancers.DOI: 10.1177/1533033818764470 PMCID: PMC5865460PMID: 29562821
