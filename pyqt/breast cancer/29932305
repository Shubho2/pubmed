We assessed changes in BMD frombaseline to 5 years of EXE treatment.METHODS: Postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer receivingEXE as adjuvant therapy were enrolled in this study. EXE was administered for 5years. The BMD of the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) was assessed bydual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5and 6 years. Oral bisphosphonate (Bis) treatment was initiated when patients werediagnosed with osteoporosis with a T-score of -2.5 or lower.RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were enrolled in the study between 2005 and 2010.The median follow-up period was 54.9 months. Forty-two patients were administeredBis. Overall, the BMD of the LS increased by 7.3% from baseline and that of theFN increased by 3.4% with 5 years of EXE treatment. At the sixth year (i.e. 1year after the treatment), BMD of the LS increased by 7.2% and that of the FNincreased by 5.7%. Furthermore, the BMD of the FN increased by 12.0% in patients treated upfront with Bis and by 1.2% in those not treated with Bis (P = 0.0262). Fractures developed in nine patients (11.1%) and seven (8.6%) had fragilityfractures.CONCLUSION: Oral Bis improves BMD of the FN in patients with osteoporosis.Five-year EXE treatment with proper addition of Bis helps maintain the BMD of theLS and FN at the sixth year.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ajco.13034 PMID: 29932305
