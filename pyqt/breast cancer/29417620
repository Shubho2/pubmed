For this reason, this polymorphism has been extensivelyinvestigated as a candidate marker for breast cancer (BC). In this context, theaim of this study was to evaluate the possible influence of HER2 Ile655Val in BC susceptibility and prognostic factors in a Brazilian population.METHODS: Polymorphism genotype was assessed through RFLP-PCR in 107 BC patientswith clinicopathological data available and in 150 women with no evidence ofneoplasia and with no familial history of BC as control group. Associationbetween this polymorphism and BC susceptibility and clinical parameters wasevaluated through odds ratio (OR) and chi-squared or Fisher's exact test,respectively.RESULTS: A significant negative association between valine allele and BCsusceptibility in dominant model was found (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.27-0.93, P = .036). No significant association was found in relation to BC clinicopathologicalfeatures (tumor size, lymph nodes commitment, histological grade, HER2overexpression, hormonal receptors, p53, and Ki-67).CONCLUSION: Although this polymorphism did not demonstrate potential as aprognostic marker, it may be a suitable susceptibility marker for BC.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcla.22406 PMID: 29417620
