However, the role and mechanisms ofCADM2 in HCC remain unclear.METHODS: The expression of CADM2 and miRNA-10b (miR-10b) in HCC tissues and cell lines were detected using real-time PCR and Western blotting. Immunofluorescence was used to detect Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression in HCCcell lines. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine miR-10b binding to CADM2 3'UTR. Wound healing assay and Transwell assay were performed to examinethe migration and invasion of HCC cells.RESULTS: We report the effect of CADM2 as a tumor suppressor in HCC. Firstly, we confirmed that CADM2 expression was significantly down regulated in HCC tissuescompared to normal tissues according to TCGA data analysis and fresh HCC sampledetection. Secondly, overexpression of CADM2 could inhibit EMT process, migratoryand invasion ability of HCC cells. Furthermore, the results indicated that CADM2 is a direct target of miR-10b in HCC cells and miR-10b/CADM2 modulates EMTprocess and migration ability via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) /AKT signalingpathway in HCC.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that miR-10b-CADM2-FAK/AKT axis plays animportant role in HCC metastasis, which might be a novel potential therapeuticoption for HCC treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0699-1 PMCID: PMC5836378PMID: 29506532
