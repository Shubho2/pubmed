Its dysregulation isresponsible for diseases including cancers. To further explore the role of MAT1in breast cancer, we investigated the pathways in which MAT1 might be involved,the association between MAT1 and molecular subtypes, and the role of MAT1 inclinical outcomes of breast cancer patients.Methods: We conducted immunohistochemistry staining on tissue microarray andimmunofluorescence staining on sections of MAT1 stable breast cancer cells. Also,we performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis,correlation analysis and prognosis analysis on public databases.Results: MAT1 was involved in multiple pathways including normal physiologysignaling and disease-related signaling. Furthermore, MAT1 positively correlated with the protein status of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and wasenriched in luminal-type and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-enrichedbreast cancer in comparison with basal-like subtype at both mRNA and proteinlevels. Correlation analysis revealed significant association between MAT1 mRNAamount and epithelial markers, mesenchymal markers, cancer stem cell markers,apoptosis markers, transcription markers and oncogenes. Consistently, the resultsof immunofluorescence stain indicated that MAT1 overexpression enhanced theprotein abundance of epidermal growth factor receptor, vimentin, sex determining region Y-box 2 and sine oculis homeobox homolog 1. Importantly, Kaplan-MeierPlotter analysis reflected that MAT1 could serve as a prognostic biomarkerpredicting worse relapse-free survival and metastasis-free survival.Conclusions: MAT1 is correlated with molecular subtypes and is associated withunfavorable prognosis for breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.03.07 PMCID: PMC6037588PMID: 30046229
