However, these tests are typically expensive, time consuming, andtissue-destructive.METHODS: In this paper, we evaluate the ability of computer-extracted nuclearmorphology features from routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images of178 early stage ER+ breast cancer patients to predict corresponding riskcategories derived using the Oncotype DX test. A total of 216 featurescorresponding to the nuclear shape and architecture categories from each of thepathologic images were extracted and four feature selection schemes: Ranksum,Principal Component Analysis with Variable Importance on Projection (PCA-VIP),Maximum-Relevance, Minimum Redundancy Mutual Information Difference (MRMR MID),and Maximum-Relevance, Minimum Redundancy - Mutual Information Quotient (MRMRMIQ), were employed to identify the most discriminating features. These features were employed to train 4 machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, NeuralNetwork, Support Vector Machine, and Linear Discriminant Analysis, via 3-foldcross validation.RESULTS: The four sets of risk categories, and the top Area Under the receiveroperating characteristic Curve (AUC) machine classifier performances were: 1) LowODx and Low mBR grade vs. High ODx and High mBR grade (Low-Low vs. High-High)(AUC = 0.83), 2) Low ODx vs. High ODx (AUC = 0.72), 3) Low ODx vs. Intermediateand High ODx (AUC = 0.58), and 4) Low and Intermediate ODx vs. High ODx(AUC = 0.65). Trained models were tested independent validation set of 53 caseswhich comprised of Low and High ODx risk, and demonstrated per-patient accuraciesranging from 75 to 86%.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that computerized image analysis of digitized H&Epathology images of early stage ER+ breast cancer might be able predict thecorresponding Oncotype DX risk categories.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4448-9 PMCID: PMC5977541PMID: 29848291
