Traditionally, breast cancerhas been seen as a disease with only progressive lesions, and here we examine thevalidity of this assumption by testing if incidence levels after introducingmammography screening can be reproduced assuming only progressive tumors.METHODS: Breast cancer incidence data 1990-2009 obtained from the initiallyscreened Norwegian counties (Akershus, Oslo, Rogaland and Hordaland) wasincluded, covering the time-period before, during and after the introduction ofmammography screening. From 1996 women aged 50-69 were invited for biennialpublic screening. Using estimates of tumor growth and screening sensitivity basedon pre-screening and prevalence screening data (1990-1998), we simulatedincidence levels during the following period (1999-2009).RESULTS: The simulated incidence levels during the period with repeatedscreenings were markedly below the observed levels. The results were robust tochanges in model parameters. Adjusting for hormone replacement therapy use, weobtained levels closer to the observed levels. However, there was still a marked gap, and only by assuming some tumors that undergo regressive changes or enter a markedly less detectable state, was our model able to reproduce the observedincidence levels.CONCLUSIONS: Models with strictly progressive tumors are only able to partlyexplain the changes in incidence levels observed after screening introduction in the initially screened Norwegian counties. More complex explanations than a time shift in detection of future clinical cancers seem to be needed to reproduce the incidence trends, questioning the basis for many over-diagnosis calculations. As data are not randomized, similar studies in other populations are wanted toexclude effect of unknown confounders.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4130-2 PMCID: PMC5819671PMID: 29463227
