Surprisingly, there is a strikingand almost complete lack of knowledge about overdiagnosis in colorectal cancerscreening. Overdiagnosis is not part of patient information material, hardlymentioned in guidelines, and not addressed in scientific or public debate. Thepresent paper proposes a semantic, conceptual and clinical framework foroverdiagnosis in CRC screening.Copyright Â© 2018 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.
