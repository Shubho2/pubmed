However, most of the previous studies were performed onmedicines being prepared from a variety of herbal and metal sources. This studyinvestigated the effects of ultramolecular dilution of the taxane anti-cancerdrugs, which are not commonly used in homeopathic medicines, on mRNA expressionprofiles of five key genes (p53, p21, COX-2, TUBB2A and TUBB3) in the breastcancer cell line MCF-7.METHOD:  MCF-7 cells were exposed to paclitaxel (Taxol) or docetaxel (Taxotere)preparations (6X, 5C and 15C dilutions prepared from pharmacologicalconcentration of 25 nmol/L) for 72 hours. The cell culture groups were evaluated with the trypan blue dye exclusion method for the proliferation/cytotoxicityrates, immuno-staining β-tubulin for microtubule organization, and reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction for gene expression levels.Fold-change ingene expression was determined by the ΔΔCt method.RESULTS:  The administration of diluted preparations had little or no cytotoxiceffect on MCF-7 cells, but altered the expression of genes analyzed with acomplex effect. According to the ΔΔCt method with a five-fold expressiondifference (p < 0.05) as a cut-off level, ultra-high dilutions of paclitaxel and docetaxel showed differential effects on the studied genes with aconcentration-independent activity. Furthermore, the dilutions disrupted themicrotubule structure of MCF-7 cells, suggesting that they retain theirbiological activity.CONCLUSION:  Despite some limitations, our findings demonstrate that geneexpression alterations also occur with ultra-high dilutions of taxane drugs.The Faculty of Homeopathy.DOI: 10.1055/s-0037-1618585 PMID: 29528476
