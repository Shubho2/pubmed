Encapsulation of PTX inpolymeric nanoparticles is used to overcome these problems but these micellesstill need improvements in stability, pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficacy, andsafety profiles. In this study, we demonstrate a facile fabrication of a stablePTX-binding micelle made from poly (ethylene glycol)-block-dendritic polylysine, whose primary amines were reacted with phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), ahydrophobic anticancer agent under clinical study. The amphiphilic conjugate(PEG-Gx-PEITC; Gx, the generation of the polylysine dendron) formed well-defined micelles whose core was composed of phenyl groups and thiourea groups binding PTXvia π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding. Compared with the PTX-loaded poly(ethyleneglycol)-block-poly(D,L-lactide) (PEGPDLLA/ PTX) micelles in clinical use,PTX-loaded PEG-Gx-PEITC third-generation (PEG-G3-PEITC/PTX) micelles showedslowed blood clearance, enhanced tumor accumulation, and thus much improved invivo therapeutic efficacy in both subcutaneous and orthotopic human breast cancerxenografts. Therefore, PEG-G3-PEITC is a promising drug delivery system for PTXin the treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s11427-017-9274-9 PMID: 29572777
