Therapeutic options are increasing, but the response totreatments is not always efficient and the risk of recurrence covers decades. In this perspective, the need to have a proper follow-up for the therapeuticresponses and for anticipating recurrence it is urgent in the clinical setting.Liquid biopsy provides the basic principle for a non-invasive method for theroutinely monitoring of BC. However, due to the heterogeneity of tumors duringonset and progression, the search for tumor DNA mutations of targeted genes inplasma/serum is a limiting factor. A possible approach overtaking this problemcomes from the measurement of cell-free DNA integrity, which is an independentfactor from the mutational status and theoretically is representative of alltumors. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art of cell-free DNA integrityresearches in BC, the controversies and the future perspective.DOI: 10.5306/wjco.v9.i2.26 PMCID: PMC5893994PMID: 29651384
