We assessed risk for 15cancers among FDRs of unselected PC probands.Methods: Data on 17 162 FDRs, with more than 336 000 person-years at risk,identified through 2305 sequential PC probands enrolled at Mayo Clinic(2000-2016) were analyzed. Family history data were provided by the probands.Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) werecalculated, comparing malignancies observed among the FDRs with that expectedusing Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data. Genetic testingwas performed among a subset of probands (n = 2094), enabling stratified analysesamong FDRs based on whether the related proband tested positive or negative forinherited mutation in 22 sequenced cancer susceptibility genes. All statisticaltests were two-sided.Results: Compared with SEER, PC risk was twofold higher among FDRs of PC probands(SIR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.78 to 2.31, P < .001). Primary liver cancer risk waselevated among female FDRs (SIR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.34 to 3.12, P < .001). PC riskwas more elevated among FDRs of mutation-positive probands (SIR = 4.32, 95%CI = 3.10 to 5.86) than FDRs of mutation-negative probands (SIR = 1.77, 95%CI = 1.51 to 2.05, between-group P < .001). FDR PC risk was higher when therelated proband was younger than age 60 years at diagnosis and mutation-positive (SIR = 5.24, 95% CI = 2.93 to 8.64) than when the proband was younger than age 60years but mutation-negative (SIR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.21 to 2.47, between-group P <.001). Breast (SIR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.63) and ovarian (SIR = 2.38, 95%CI = 1.30 to 4.00) cancers were elevated among FDRs of mutation-positiveprobands.Conclusions: Our study substantiates twofold risk of PC among FDRs of PC patientsand suggests increased risk for primary liver cancer among female FDRs. FDRs ofsusceptibility mutation carriers had substantially increased risk for PC andincreased risk for breast and ovarian cancers.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djx272 PMID: 29982661
