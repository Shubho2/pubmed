The "synthetic lethal approach" leverages on cancer-specific genetic rewiring to deliver a therapeutic regimen that preferentially targetsmalignant cells while sparing normal cells. The utility of this system is evidentin several recent studies, particularly in poor prognosis cancers withloss-of-function mutations that become "treatable" when two otherwise discreteand unrelated genes are targeted simultaneously. This review focuses on thechemotherapeutic targeting of epigenetic alterations in cancer cells andconsolidates a network that outlines the interplay between epigenetic and geneticregulators in DNA damage repair. This network consists of numeroussynergistically acting relationships that are druggable, even in recalcitranttriple-negative breast cancer. This collective knowledge points to the dawn of a new era of personalized medicine.DOI: 10.1007/s00018-018-2866-0 PMID: 30003270
