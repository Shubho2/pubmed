The impact of transcriptional changes on metabolism has beenintensively studied in hormone-dependent cancers, and in particular, in prostate and breast cancer. These cancers have strong similarities in the function ofimportant transcriptional drivers, such as the oestrogen and androgen receptors, at the level of dietary risk and epidemiology, genetics and therapeutically. Inthis review, we will focus on the function of these nuclear hormone receptors andtheir downstream impact on metabolism, with a particular focus on lipidmetabolism. We go on to discuss how lipid metabolism remains dysregulated as the cancers progress. We conclude by discussing the opportunities that this presents for drug repurposing, imaging and the development and testing of new therapeuticsand treatment combinations.Â© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-18-0048 PMID: 29760165
