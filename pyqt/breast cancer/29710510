However, the crucial impacts of NNT-AS1 on the malignancy of breast cancer have not been elaborated. This study aims to detect the expression pattern and functional effects of NNT-AS1 in breast cancer. qRT-PCR analysis was applied to detect the expression of NNT-AS1 in both BC tissues and matched normaltissues. Loss of function assay was carried out to detect the effects of silencedNNT-AS1 on proliferation, metastasis and EMT process of BC cells. To understandthe functional mechanism of NNT-AS1, mechanism assays were designed and performedin BC cells. Subcellular fractionation assay demonstrated that NNT-AS1 waslocated in the cytoplasm of BC cells. Therefore, NNT-AS1 might exert ceRNAfunctions in BC cells. To validate this hypothesis, we found the combinationbetween NNT-AS1 and miR-142-3p through conducting bioinformatics analysis, RIPand luciferase reporter assays. Similarly, the combination between miR-142-3p andZEB1 was verified. Finally, the recue assays were carried out to demonstrate the effects of NNT-AS1/miR-142-3p/ZEB1 axis on the biological behaviors of BC cells. All the above findings revealed a fact that NNT-AS1 affects breast cancerprogression through modulating miR-142-3p/ZEB1 axis.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
