China.(2)Department of Statistics, Weihai Municipal Hospital, Weihai, Shandong 264200, P.R. China.Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) possesses various functions inhuman cells, and altered NAMPT expression is associated with humancarcinogenesis. The present study detected the expression of NAMPT in normal and cancerous breast tissues from 83 patients using immunohistochemistry, andanalyzed its association with the clinicopathological and survival data of thepatients. NAMPT was significantly overexpressed in the breast invasive ductalcarcinoma tissues compared with adjacent normal mammary gland tissues.Upregulated NAMPT expression was associated with a larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, advanced clinical tumor-node-metastasis stages, and estrogen receptorand progesterone receptor expression. Furthermore, NAMPT expression wasassociated with poor overall and disease-free survival in patients with breastcancer. In conclusion, NAMPT increased protein expression in tumor cells maycontribute to the development and progression of breast invasive ductalcarcinoma. Thus, detection of NAMPT expression might be useful as a biomarker forthe early detection and prognosis prediction of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8164 PMCID: PMC5920386PMID: 29725408
