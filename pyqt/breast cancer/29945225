We hypothesized that these metabolites bind to the human estrogenreceptor (ER) and promote estrogen signaling. We tested this using models ofER-mediated cellular proliferation. The estrogenic properties of 3-hydroxyn-butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (3OH) and 2-hydroxy iso-butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (2OH)were determined using the ER-positive, estrogen-dependent human breast cancercell lines MCF-7, and T47D. The 3OH metabolite induced cellular proliferationwith EC50 of 8.2 µM in MCF-7 cells. The EC50 for 3OH in T47D cells could not bereached. The 2OH metabolite induced proliferation with EC50 of 2.2 µM and 43.0 µMin MCF-7 and T47D cells, respectively. The EC50 for the parental IsoBuP and BuPwas 0.30 and 1.2 µM in MCF-7 cells, respectively. The expression of apro-proliferative, estrogen-inducible gene (GREB1) was induced by these compoundsand blocked by co-administration of an ER antagonist (ICI 182, 780), confirmingthe ER-dependence of these effects. The metabolites promoted significantER-dependent transcriptional activity of an ERE-luciferase reporter construct at 10 and 20 µM for 2OH and 10 µM for 3OH. Computational docking studies showed thatthe paraben compounds exhibited the potential for favorable ligand-binding domaininteractions with human ERα in a manner similar to known x-ray crystal structuresof 17ß-estradiol in complex with ERα. We conclude that the hydroxylatedmetabolites of BuP and IsoBuP are weak estrogens and should be considered asadditional components of potential endocrine disrupting effects upon parabenexposure.DOI: 10.1093/toxsci/kfy063 PMCID: PMC6016648 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29945225
