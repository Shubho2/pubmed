In this study, we investigatedthe role of MAPT-AS1 in the progression and paclitaxel resistance in breastcancer, and the regulation between MAPT-AS1 and its natural comparable sensetranscripts MAPT.Methods: We analysed the breast cancer patients' clinical information andexplored the function of MAPT-AS1 by gain- and loss-of function assays in vitroand in vivo. The regulation between MAPT-AS1 and MAPT was confirmed by geneexpression analysis and rescue assays. To verify the hypothesis that MAPT-AS1 andMAPT might form a duplex structure, we performed RT-PCR assays on RNA afterα-amanitin treatment.Results: By analysing the breast cancer patients' clinical information from theTCGA database, we found that ER-negative patients with younger age (< 60), largertumors (≥ 2 cm), metastatic lymph nodes and stages (III-IV) had higher expressionof MAPT-AS1. MAPT-AS1 is correlated with the cell growth, invasiveness andpaclitaxel resistance by regulating its natural comparable sense transcripts MAPTin ER-negative breast cancer cells. The result revealed that MAPT-AS1overexpression could partially protect the MAPT mRNA from degradation, whileMAPT-AS1 knockdown decreased the stability of MAPT mRNA. Meanwhile, MAPTknockdown decreased the expression of MAPT-AS1 mRNA. MAPT-AS1 expressedcoordinately with MAPT in breast tumor tissues.Conclusion: Our study is the first to report a novel lncRNA MAPT-AS1 in humancancer. ER-negative patients with younger age (< 60), larger tumors (≥ 2 cm),metastatic lymph nodes and stages (III-IV) had higher expression of MAPT-AS1.MAPT-AS1 is correlated with the cell growth, invasiveness and paclitaxelresistance in ER-negative breast cancer cells through antisense pairing withMAPT. MAPT-AS1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in ER-negative breast cancers.DOI: 10.1186/s13578-018-0207-5 PMCID: PMC5799917PMID: 29441192
