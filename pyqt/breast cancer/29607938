Hypertensionand proteinuria are characteristic adverse events of BV therapy. We assessed the potential of these adverse events as predictors of BV treatment responses. Ourresults revealed that groups that developed hypertension and proteinuria early(by day 56) had a stronger antitumor response (Fisher's exact test p<0.05).However, no significant difference was observed in progression-free survival (theKaplan-Meier method and Log-rank test). As a reference, age, the treatment line, subtypes, liver and renal function, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia history,body mass index, influencing concomitant medicine, average relative doseintensity and hematotoxicity did not significantly differ between groups with or without hypertension and with or without proteinuria. These results indicate the potential of the development of hypertension and proteinuria as predictors ofimproved outcomes with PTX plus BV therapy in patients with breast cancer.However, since both adverse events may preclude the continuation of treatment,their earlier management may be required.DOI: 10.1248/bpb.b17-00605 PMID: 29607938
