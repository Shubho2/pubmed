High-intensity focused ultrasound(HIFU) is a non-invasive cancer treatment, but the success of HIFU ablation wasdepending on the system type, imaging technique, ablation protocol, and patientselection. Therefore, we aimed to determine the relationship between breasttissue structure and focal error during breast cancer HIFU treatment.Methods: Numerical simulations of the breast cancer HIFU ablation were performed using digital breast phantoms constructed using the magnetic resonance imagingdata obtained from 12 patients.Results: The focal shapes were distorted despite breast tissue representing soft tissue. Focal errors are caused by the complex distribution of fibroglandulartissue, and they depend on the target position and the arrangement of thetransducer. We demonstrated that the focusing ratio increases with the decreasein the local acoustic inhomogeneity, implying that it may be used as an indicatorto reduce the HIFU focal error depending on the breast structure.Conclusions: The obtained results demonstrated that the focal error observedduring the breast cancer HIFU treatment is highly dependent on the structure offibroglandular tissue. The optimal arrangement of the transducer to the targetcan be obtained by minimizing the local acoustic inhomogeneity before the breast cancer HIFU treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s40349-018-0111-9 PMCID: PMC6010025PMID: 29951205
