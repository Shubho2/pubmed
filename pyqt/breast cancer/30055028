Specifically, the PSEN1 rs165934 AA genotype was associated with apoorer survival (adjusted hazards ratio [adjHR] = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.07-1.84, and P= .014), compared with the CC + CA genotype, while MAML2 rs76032516 AA + ACgenotypes were associated with a poorer survival (adjHR = 1.58, 95% CI =1.16-2.14, P = .004), compared with the CC genotype. The combined analysis ofthese two SNPs revealed that the death risk increased as the number ofunfavourable genotypes increased in a dose-dependent manner (Ptrend < .001).Additionally, the expression quantitative trait loci analysis revealed that theSNP rs165932 in the rs165934 LD block (r2 = .946) was associated with expression levels of PSEN1, which might be responsible for the observed association with SNPrs165934. The associations of PSEN1 rs165934 and MAML2 rs76032516 of the Notchsignalling pathway genes with OS in Chinese EOC patients are novel findings,which need to be validated in other large and independent studies.Â© 2018 The Authors.
