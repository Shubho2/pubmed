Weinvestigated the efficacy of CYH33 against breast cancer and explored potentialpredictive biomarkers. CYH33 potently restrained tumor growth in mice bearinghuman breast cancer cell xenografts and in R26-Pik3caH1047R;MMTV-Cre transgenicmice. CYH33 significantly inhibited proliferation of a panel of human breastcancer cells, while diversity in sensitivity has been observed. Cells harboringactivating PIK3CA mutation, amplified HER2 were more responsive to CYH33 thantheir counterparts. Besides, cells in HER2-enriched or luminal subtype were more sensitive to CYH33 than basal-like breast cancer. Sensitivity to CYH33 has beenfurther revealed to be associated with induction of G1 phase arrest andsimultaneous inhibition of Akt and ERK. Sensitivity of patient-derived xenograft to CYH33 was also positively correlated with decrease in phosphorylated ERK.Taken together, CYH33 is a promising PI3Kα inhibitor for breast cancer treatment and decrease in ERK phosphorylation may indicate its efficacy, which providesuseful clues for rational design of the ongoing clinical trials.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
