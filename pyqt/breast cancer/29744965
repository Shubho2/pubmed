Multiple randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs) have examined mind-body approaches to mitigating FCR. Wesummarized characteristics of these trials and calculated their pooled effects ondecreasing FCR.METHODS: Six electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to May 2017, using a strategy that included multiple terms for RCTs, cancer,mind-body medicine, and FCR. Data extraction and reporting followed Cochrane and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)guidelines. Pooled effect sizes on self-report measures of FCR were computed byusing random-effects models.RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs (pooled N = 2806) were included. Most studies (53%) werepublished since 2015 and targeted a single cancer type (84%; mostly breast).Intervention sessions (median = 6, mode = 4) tended to last 120 minutes and occuracross 1.5 months. Delivery was predominantly in-person (63%) to either groups(42%) or individuals (42%). Most interventions incorporated multiple mind-bodycomponents (53%), commonly cognitive-behavioral skills (58%), or meditativepractices (53%). Small-to-medium pooled effect sizes were observedpostintervention (Hedges' g = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.49, -0.23, P < .001) and atfollow-up assessments (median = 8 months, P < .001). Potential modifiers (controlgroup design, group/individual delivery, use of cognitive-behavioral ormindfulness skills, number of mind-body components, cancer treatment status, and number of sessions) did not reach statistical significance.CONCLUSIONS: Mind-body interventions are efficacious for reducing FCR, withsmall-to-medium effect sizes that persist after intervention delivery ends.Recommendations include testing effects among survivors of various cancers andexploring the optimal integration of mind-body practices for managing fundamentaluncertainties and fears during cancer survivorship.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4757 PMID: 29744965
