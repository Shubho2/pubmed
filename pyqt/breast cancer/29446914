To date, much evidence hasdemonstrated that these isoforms can differentially regulate target genes andmodulate their expression. Thus, quantification of individual isoforms may helpto link clinical outcome to p53 status and to improve cancer patient treatment.However, there are few studies on accurate determination of p53 isoforms,probably due to sequence homology of these isoforms and also their low abundance.In this study, a targeted proteomics assay combining molecularly imprintedpolymers (MIPs) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) wasdeveloped for simultaneous quantification of C-terminal p53 isoforms.Isoform-specific surrogate peptides (i.e., KPLDGEYFTLQIR (peptide-α) for isoform α, KPLDGEYFTLQDQTSFQK (peptide-β) for isoform β, and KPLDGEYFTLQMLLDLR(peptide-γ) for isoform γ) were first selected and used in both MIPs enrichmentand mass spectrometric detection. The common sequence KPLDGEYFTLQ of these three surrogate peptides was used as single template in MIPs. In addition tooptimization of imprinting conditions and characterization of the prepared MIPs, binding affinity and cross-reactivity of the MIPs for each surrogate peptide werealso evaluated. As a result, a LOQ of 5 nM was achieved, which was >15-fold more sensitive than that without MIPs. Finally, the assay was validated and applied tosimultaneous quantitative analysis of C-terminal p53 isoforms α, β, and γ inseveral human breast cell lines (i.e., MCF-10A normal cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cancer cells, and drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cancer cells). This study is among thefirst to employ single template MIPs and cross-reactivity phenomenon to selectisoform-specific surrogate peptides and enable simultaneous quantification ofprotein isoforms in LC-MS/MS-based targeted proteomics.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02890 PMID: 29446914
