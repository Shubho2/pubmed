Germany.BACKGROUND: The small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) biglycan (BGN) anddecorin (DCN) linked with sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains exhibitoncogenic or tumor suppressive potentials depending on the cellular context andassociation with GAGs.OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that structural alterations and expression levels ofBGN, DCN and their associated chondroitin sulfate (CS) polymerizing enzymes,dermatan sulfate (DS) epimerases and various sulfatases might be correlated with the tumor (sub)type and patients' survival.METHODS: We acquired breast cancer (BC) and glioma patients' datasets fromcBioPortal and R2 Genomics. Structural alterations and the expression pattern of CS polymerizing enzymes, DS epimerases and carbohydrate sulfotransferases (CHST) were compared to that of BGN and DCN and correlated to their clinical relevance.RESULTS: In BC, no mutations, but amplifications (0.2 - 2.1 %) and deletions(0.05 - 0.4 %) were found in BGN, DCN and CS/DS enzymes. In contrast, missenseand/or truncated mutations (0.1 - 0.5 %), but a reduced amplification rate (0 -1.5 %) were found in glioma. When compared to BC the structural abnormalitiescaused altered mRNA expression levels of BGN, DCN, GAG synthesizing enzymes andCHST. Mutations in SLPRs, CHSY1, CHST4 and CHSY3 were correlated with a poorprognosis in glioma, while lack of mutations and copy number variations in theSLRPs, CHSY3, CHST15 and DSE displayed an increased survival in BC.CONCLUSIONS: A distinct association of BGN and DCN with CHST, CS polymerizingenzymes and DS epimerases was found in BC and glioma. Thus, a unique pattern ofstructural alterations and expression, which has clinical relevance, was foundfor PGs and GAG synthesizing enzymes and CHST in BC and glioma, which might help to identify high risk patients and to develop personalized therapeutics.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1568009618666180706165845 PMID: 29984655
