Because TNBC patients areunresponsive to current targeted therapies, new therapeutic strategies areurgently needed. While proteasome inhibition by bortezomib (BZ) or carfilzomib(CZ) has been effective in treating hematological malignancies, it has been less effective in solid tumors, including TNBC, but the mechanisms are incompletelyunderstood. Here we report that proteasome inhibition significantly increasesexpression of IL-8, and its receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, in TNBC cells. Suppressionor neutralization of the BZ-induced IL-8 potentiates the BZ cytotoxic andanti-proliferative effect in TNBC cells. The IL-8 expression induced byproteasome inhibition in TNBC cells is mediated by IκB kinase (IKK), increasednuclear accumulation of p65 NFκB, and by IKK-dependent p65 recruitment to IL-8promoter. Importantly, inhibition of IKK activity significantly decreasesproliferation, migration, and invasion of BZ-treated TNBC cells. These dataprovide the first evidence demonstrating that proteasome inhibition increases theIL-8 signaling in TNBC cells, and suggesting that IKK inhibitors may increaseeffectiveness of proteasome inhibitors in treating TNBC.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201858 PMID: 30089134
