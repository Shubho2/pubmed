Epub 2018 May 17.Hormonal contraception and breast cancer.Westhoff CL(1), Pike MC(2).Author information: (1)Columbia University, New York, NY. Electronic address: clw3@columbia.edu.(2)Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.The recent Danish cohort study reported a 20% increased risk of breast canceramong current and recent hormonal contraception users. These results are largely consistent with previous studies. This study did not report on stage of diseaseat diagnosis and it is not clear to what extent the apparent increased risk maybe due to a small advance in the timing of diagnosis. This study did not reporton the risk associated with the use of a 20-μg ethinyl estradiol pill. They didfind an increasing risk in current users of longer duration and an increased riskwith use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system-both of these potentiallyimportant findings have not been consistently found in previous studies andrequire further investigation. The breast cancer effects described now inmultiple studies wane with time, and in the long-term hormonal contraception use has been found not to be associated with any increased total cancer risk.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
