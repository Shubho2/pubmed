We used Coxproportional hazard regression to assess the association between metformin usecompared to sulfonylurea use and incidence cancer risk for 10 solid tumors. Weadjusted for clinical covariates including hemoglobin A1C, antihypertensive andlipid-lowering medications, and body mass index. Incidence cancers were definedby ICD-9-CM codes.RESULTS: Among 42,217 new metformin users and 42,217 matched-new sulfonylureausers, we identified 2,575 incidence cancers. Metformin was inversely associated with liver cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.44, 95% CI 0.31, 0.64)compared to sulfonylurea. We found no association between metformin use and risk of incidence bladder, breast, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, lung, pancreatic, prostate, or renal cancer when compared to sulfonylurea use.CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study that accounted for time-related biases,we observed no association between the use of metformin and most cancers;however, we found a strong inverse association between metformin and livercancer. Randomized trials of metformin for prevention of liver cancer would beuseful to verify these observations.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1058-4 PMID: 30022336
