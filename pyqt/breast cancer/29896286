The roles of SIRTl in breast cancer is multifaceted depending on its substrate from upstream ordownstream signaling pathway. In this study, we sought to make clear theregulating effects of SIRT1 in breast cancer cells, and to explore the underlyingmechanisms through which SIRT1 regulates breast cancer. First, our results showedthat SIRT1 was significantly up-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cells,which correlated with histological grade, tumor size, as well as lymph nodemetastasis. Then we established SIRT1-overexpressed and SIRT1- knockdown breastcancer cell lines to investigate the functions of SIRT1 in regulating colonyformation, cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell apoptosis and migration. We foundthat overexpression of SIRT1 significantly promoted breast cancer growth both in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockdown of SIRT1 inhibited these phenotypes.Furthermore, SIRT1 was found to interact with Akt directly, consequentlypromoting the activity of Akt in breast cancer cells in vitro and positivelycorrelating with expression of Akt, P-Akt, in breast cancer tissues in vivo. Downregulation the activity of Akt partially weakened the proliferative effectmediated by SIRT1. Taken together, our results demonstrated SIRT1's tumorpromotion function and potential mechanisms in breast cancer, thus providingvaluable therapeutic targets for breast cancer.DOI: 10.7150/jca.24275 PMCID: PMC5995935PMID: 29896286
