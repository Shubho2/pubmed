MA or HCD alone or in combination with TMXdose-dependently inhibited MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth, with a more potentinhibition on MDA-MB 231 cells. Furthermore, this novel combination significantlyinduced S and G2/M cell cycle phase in MDA-MB 231 than MCF-7 cells. Furtherdetermination of the apoptotic induction showed that MA or HCD and TMXcombination inhibited MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cancer cells by upregulating Bax andby downregulating Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression without altering Caspase-8and Caspase-12 expression. These results suggest that MA or HCD pretreatment may potentiate the anti-tumor effect of tamoxifen on breast cancer.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23081966 PMID: 30082655
