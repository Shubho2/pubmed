InHER2-positive breast tumors, expression of truncated HER2 isoforms resulting fromalternative translation and/or carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) resulting fromproteolysis (collectively, t-erbB2) have been associated with shortenedprogression-free survival of patients. Thus, to advance clinical pathology andinform treatment decisions, we developed a high-selectivity cytopathology assaycapable of distinguishing t-erbB2 from full-length HER2 expression without theneed for isoform-specific antibodies. Our microfluidic, single-cell western blot,employs electrophoretic separations to resolve full-length HER2 from the smaller t-erbB2 in each ~28â€‰pL single-cell lysate. Subsequently, a pan-HER2 antibodydetects all resolved HER2 protein forms via immunoprobing. In analysis of eightbreast tumor biopsies, we identified two tumors comprised of 15% and 40%t-erbB2-expressing cells. By single-cell western blotting of thet-erbB2-expressing cells, we observed statistically different ratios of t-erbB2proteins to full-length HER2 expression. Further, target multiplexing andclustering analyses scrutinized signaling, including ribosomal S6, within thet-erbB2-expressing cell subpopulation. Taken together, cytometric assays thatreport both protein isoform profiles and signaling state offer cancerclassification taxonomies with unique relevance to precisely describing drugresistance mechanisms in which oncoprotein isoforms/fragments are implicated.DOI: 10.1038/s41698-018-0052-3 PMCID: PMC5871910PMID: 29872719
