A radical axillary node dissection is rarely indicated nowadays due to several factors including screening with detection of small node negative cancers, introduction of targeted node sampling, less reliance on informationfrom nodal staging for adjuvant therapy decision making and evidence thatnon-surgical treatments such as systemic therapies (chemotherapy, hormonaltherapy, biological therapy) together with radiotherapy can safely treat lowburden axillary disease. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone with omission offurther axillary surgery for nodal macrometastases (>2 mm) might be sufficiently extirpative to achieve local control when combined with adjuvant treatments.There remain unanswered questions on the safety of SLNB post chemotherapy inpatients with biopsy-proven nodal disease at presentation and whether omission ofaxillary node dissection is feasible in selected cases. Emerging evidencesuggests that a complete radiological response with removal of at least 3 nodes(including clipped nodes at time of biopsy) can yield false negative rates of<10% and be a safe option. New technologies involving percutaneous biopsy ofsentinel nodes under radiological guidance are under investigation and couldpotentially replace surgical staging of the axilla in the future. Moreover,omission of any type of node biopsy might be a potential option in more favorabletumors and could herald the beginning of the end for histological axillarysampling in selected cases.DOI: 10.23736/S0026-4733.18.07728-3 PMID: 29589679
