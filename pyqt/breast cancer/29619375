The aim of this treatment option is to irradiate tumor tissue, while sparing normal tissue as much as possible. Frequent imaging during the course of the treatment (image guided radiotherapy) allows for determination of the location and shape of the prostate (target) and of the organs at risk.This information is used to increase accuracy in radiation dose deliveryresulting in better tumor control and lower toxicity. Ultrasound imaging isharmless for the patient, it is cost-effective, and it allows for real-timevolumetric organ tracking. For these reasons, it is an ideal technique for image guidance during EBRT workflows. Review papers have been published in which theuse of ultrasound imaging in EBRT workflows for different cancer sites (prostate,breast, etc.) was extensively covered. This new review paper aims at providingthe readers with an update on the current status for prostate cancer ultrasoundguided EBRT treatments.DOI: 10.1155/2018/7569590 PMCID: PMC5829356PMID: 29619375
