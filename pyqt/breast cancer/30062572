Obesity is also associated withincreased breast cancer risk and mortality. Few studies have examined changes in telomere length in overweight or obese breast cancer survivors. The purpose ofour study was to examine the effect of a 6-month diet- and exercise-inducedweight loss intervention versus usual care on telomere length in breast cancersurvivors.METHODS: 151 breast cancer survivors with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 wererandomly assigned to a 6-month weight loss intervention (n = 93) or to usual care(n = 58). Fasting blood samples, height, weight, physical activity, and diet weremeasured at baseline and 6-months. Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured byquantitative-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) done on buffy coat-extractedgenomic DNA. Mean baseline to 6-month changes were compared between groups(intention-to-treat) using generalized estimating equations.RESULTS: Complete telomere data were available in 125 participants. Women were58 ± 8 years, with BMI 33.0 ± 6.2 kg/m2 and were 2.9 ± 2.5 years from diagnosis; 90% were non-Hispanic white, and 76% had stage 0/I breast cancer. After 6 months,women randomized to weight loss had 3% telomere lengthening compared to 5%shortening in the usual care group (p = 0.12). Among women with stage 0/I, theintervention group experienced 7% telomere lengthening compared to 8% shortening in the usual care group (p = 0.01). No intervention effect was observed in women with stage II/III breast cancer.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a weight loss intervention in stage 0 and 1breast cancer survivors may lead to telomere lengthening, compared to ashortening in their usual care counterparts.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4895-7 PMID: 30062572
