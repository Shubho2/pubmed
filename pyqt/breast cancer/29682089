Wehypothesized that deafness, autosomal dominant 5 (DFNA5) may be a valuablebiomarker, based upon strong indications for its role as tumor suppressor geneand its function in regulated cell death. In this study, we aimed to analyzeDFNA5 methylation and expression in the largest breast cancer cohort to dateusing publicly available data from TCGA, in order to further unravel the role of DFNA5 as detection and/or prognostic marker in breast cancer. We analyzedInfinium HumanMethylation450k data, covering 22 different CpGs in the DFNA5 gene (668 breast adenocarcinomas and 85 normal breast samples) and DFNA5 expression(Agilent 244K Custom Gene Expression: 476 breast adenocarcinomas and 56 normalbreast samples; RNA-sequencing: 666 breast adenocarcinomas and 71 normal breastsamples).Results: DFNA5 methylation and expression were significantly different betweenbreast cancer and normal breast samples. Overall, breast cancer samples showedhigher DFNA5 methylation in the putative gene promoter compared to normal breast samples, whereas in the gene body and upstream of the putative gene promoter, theopposite is true. Furthermore, DFNA5 methylation, in 10 out of 22 CpGs, andexpression were significantly higher in lobular compared to ductal breastcancers. An important result of this study was the identification of acombination of one CpG in the gene promoter (CpG07504598) and one CpG in the genebody (CpG12922093) of DFNA5, which was able to discriminate between breast cancerand normal breast samples (AUC = 0.93). This model was externally validated inthree independent datasets. Moreover, we showed that estrogen receptor state isassociated with DFNA5 methylation and expression. Finally, we were able to find asignificant effect of DFNA5 gene body methylation on a 5-year overall survivaltime.Conclusions: We conclude that DFNA5 methylation shows strong potential asdetection and prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13148-018-0479-y PMCID: PMC5896072PMID: 29682089
