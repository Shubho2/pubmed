This study evaluates the excess risk of secondary cancerfor various breast radiotherapy techniques including accelerated partial breastirradiation (APBI).METHODS: Secondary cancers Lifetime Attributable Risks (LAR) were calculatedusing a modified BEIR-VII formalism to account for the specific survival ofbreast cancer patients. Those survivals were extracted from the SEER database.Doses scattered to various organs were measured into a Rando phantom withcustom-made breast phantoms. Treatments delivered typical doses of brachytherapy APBI (34 Gy in 10 fractions), external beam APBI (38.5 Gy in 10 fractions) using 3D-conformal, Cyberknife stereotactic (CK), or VMAT, as well as whole breastirradiation (WBI) delivering 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions.RESULTS: WBI resulted in the highest total LAR, with 4.3% excess risk ofsecondary cancer for a patient treated at age 50 years. Lung cancers accountedfor 75-97% of secondary malignancies. For a typical early stage patientirradiated at 50, the excess risks of secondary lung cancer were 1.1% formulticatheter HDR, between 2.2% and 2.5% for 3D-CRT or CK, 3.5% for VMAT APBI,and 3.8% for WBI.CONCLUSIONS: APBI reduces the risk of secondary cancer 2-4 fold compared to WBI. These techniques are well suited for long-living early stage breast cancerpatients. HDR brachytherapy and 3D-conformal APBI achieve mean lung doses between1 and 1.5 Gy, which could serve as reference.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
