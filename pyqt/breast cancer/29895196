[Epub ahead of print]The acid-base transport proteins NHE1 and NBCn1 regulate cell cycle progressionin human breast cancer cells.Flinck M(1), Kramer SH(1), Schnipper J(1), Andersen AP(1), Pedersen SF(1).Author information: (1)a Section for Cell Biology and Physiology, Department of Biology , University of Copenhagen , Copenhagen Ø , Denmark.Precise acid-base homeostasis is essential for maintaining normal cellproliferation and growth. Conversely, dysregulated acid-base homeostasis, withincreased acid extrusion and marked extracellular acidification, is an enablingfeature of solid tumors, yet the mechanisms through which intra- andextracellular pH (pHi, pHe) impact proliferation and growth are incompletelyunderstood. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of pH, andspecifically of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 and Na+, HCO3- transporter NBCn1, oncell cycle progression and its regulators in human breast cancer cells. Reductionof pHe to 6.5, a common condition in tumors, significantly delayed cell cycleprogression in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The NHE1 protein level peaked in S phase and that of NBCn1 in G2/M. Steady state pHi changed through the cellcycle, from 7.1 in early S phase to 6.8 in G2, recovering again in M phase. This pattern, as well as net acid extrusion capacity, was dependent on NHE1 and NBCn1.Accordingly, knockdown of either NHE1 or NBCn1 reduced proliferation, prolongedcell cycle progression in a manner involving S phase prolongation and delayedG2/M transition, and altered the expression pattern and phosphorylation of cellcycle regulatory proteins. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, that bothNHE1 and NBCn1 regulate cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells, and wepropose that this involves cell cycle phase-specific pHi regulation by the twotransporters.DOI: 10.1080/15384101.2018.1464850 PMID: 29895196
