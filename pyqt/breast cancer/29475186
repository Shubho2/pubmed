This paper demonstrates an optofluidic metasurfacethat combines silicon-on-insulator (SOI) nanophotonics and nanofluidics torealize a high-performance, lateral flow-through biosensor. The metasurface ismade of a periodic array of silicon nanoposts on an SOI substrate, andfunctionalized with specific receptor molecules. Bonding of apolydimethylsiloxane slab directly onto the surface results in an ultracompactbiosensor, where analyte solutions are restricted to flow only in the spacebetween the nanoposts. No flow exists above the nanoposts. This sensor designovercomes the issue with diffusion-limited detection of many other biosensors.The lateral flow-through feature, in conjunction with high-Q resonance modesassociated with optical bound states of the metasurface, offers an improvedsensitivity to subtle molecule-bonding induced changes in refractive index. Thedevice exhibits a resonance mode around 1550 nm wavelength and provides an index sensitivity of 720 nm/RIU. Biosensing is conducted to detect the epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (ErbB2), a protein biomarker for early-stage breast cancerscreening, by monitoring resonance wavelength shifts in response to specificanalyte-ligand binding events at the metasurface. The limit of detection of thedevice is 0.7 ng mL-1 for ErbB2.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bios.2018.02.038 PMID: 29475186
