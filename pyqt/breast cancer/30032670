To increase oxygen tension in hypoxic areas, micro- and nanobubbleshave been investigated by various researchers. In the present research,lipid-shelled oxygen nanobubbles (ONBs) were synthesized through a sonicationmethod to reverse hypoxic conditions created in a custom-made hypoxic chamber.Release of oxygen gas from ONBs in deoxygenated water was evaluated by measuring dissolved oxygen. Hypoxic conditions were evaluated by performing in vitroexperiments on MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells through the expression of HIF-1α andthe fluorescence of image-iT™ hypoxia reagent. The results indicated thedegradation of HIF-1α after the introduction of ONBs. We propose that ONBs aresuccessful in reversing hypoxia, downregulating HIF-1α, and improving cellularconditions, leading to further medical applications.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1492420 PMID: 30032670
