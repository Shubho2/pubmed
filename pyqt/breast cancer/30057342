Amotivating application is to characterize the perturbation of DNA copy numberalterations (CNAs) on downstream protein levels in tumors. Through a penalizedmultivariate regression framework, spaceMap jointly models high dimensionalprotein levels as responses and high dimensional CNAs as predictors. In thissetup, spaceMap infers an undirected network among proteins together with adirected network encoding how CNAs perturb the protein network. spaceMap can beapplied to learn other types of regulatory relationships from high dimensionalmolecular profiles, especially those exhibiting hub structures. Simulationstudies show spaceMap has greater power in detecting regulatory relationshipsover competing methods. Additionally, spaceMap includes a network analysistoolkit for biological interpretation of inferred networks. We applied spaceMapto the CNAs, gene expression and proteomics data sets from CPTAC-TCGA breast(n=77) and ovarian (n=174) cancer studies. Each cancer exhibited disruption of'ion transmembrane transport' and 'regulation from RNA polymerase II promoter' byCNA events unique to each cancer. Moreover, using protein levels as a responseyields a more functionally-enriched network than using RNA expressions in bothcancer types. The network results also help to pinpoint crucial cancer genes and provide insights on the functional consequences of important CNA in breast andovarian cancers.
