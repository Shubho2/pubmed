This technique plays animportant role in early detection of breast cancer to women of all ages,including pregnant or nursing women, with different sizes of breast, irrespectiveof either fatty or dense breast. This proposed complementary technique makes use of infrared emission emanating from the breast. Emanating radiations from thesurface of the breast under test are detected with an infrared camera to map the thermal gradients over it, in order to reveal hidden tumors inside it. One of thereliable active infrared thermographic technique, linear frequency modulatedthermal wave imaging is adopted to detect tumors present inside the breast.Further, phase and amplitude images are constructed using frequency andtime-domain data analysis schemes. Obtained results show the potential of theproposed technique for early diagnosis of breast cancer in fatty as well as densebreasts.(2018) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).DOI: 10.1117/1.JBO.23.3.037001 PMID: 29560626
