Many Varian Eclipse-based centers have access to AXB; however, a thoroughunderstanding of how it will affect plan characteristics and, subsequently,clinical practice is necessary prior to implementation. We characterized thedifference in breast plan quality between AXB and AAA for dissemination toclinicians during implementation.METHODS: Locoregional irradiation plans were created with AAA for 30 breastcancer patients with a prescription dose of 50 Gy to the breast and 45 Gy to the regional node, in 25 fractions. The internal mammary chain (IMCCTV ) nodes werecovered by 80% of the breast dose. AXB, both dose-to-water and dose-to-mediumreporting, was used to recalculate plans while maintaining constant monitorunits. Target coverage and organ-at-risk doses were compared between the twoalgorithms using dose-volume parameters. An analysis to assess location-specific changes was performed by dividing the breast into nine subvolumes in thesuperior-inferior and left-right directions.RESULTS: There were minimal differences found between the AXB and AAA calculated plans. The median difference between AXB and AAA for breastCTV V95% , was <2.5%. For IMCCTV , the median differences V95% , and V80% were <5% and 0%,respectively; indicating IMCCTV coverage only decreased when marginally covered. Mean superficial dose increased by a median of 3.2 Gy. In the subvolume analysis,the medial subvolumes were "hotter" when recalculated with AXB and the lateralsubvolumes "cooler" with AXB; however, all differences were within 2 Gy.CONCLUSION: We observed minimal difference in magnitude and spatial distribution of dose when comparing the two algorithms. The largest observable differencesoccurred in superficial dose regions. Therefore, clinical implementation of AXBfrom AAA for breast radiotherapy is not expected to result in changes in clinicalpractice for prescribing or planning breast radiotherapy.© 2018 The Authors.
