Dev Cell. 2018 Jun 18;45(6):696-711.e8.The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key driver of cancermetastasis. In this issue of Developmental Cell, Aiello et al. (2018) demonstratethat an EMT mechanism involving protein internalization impacts cell migration,while Reichert et al. (2018) identify epithelial plasticity as a determinant ofmetastatic organotropism in pancreatic cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
