Up to 82% of breast cancer patientsreceive a chemotherapy‑containing treatment regimen. However, numerous breasttumors recur within 10 years following an initial response and are frequentlyresistant to previous therapeutic agents. Thus, to analyze the crucial factors,and whether the development of resistance in tumor cells follows certainpatterns, is of great importance. In the present study, the clinical treatmentschedule of the frequently used chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin was applied in an in vitro model, the Molecular Evolution Assay (MEA), leading to resistanceformation. By investigating the alterations in protein expression in MCF‑7 breastcancer cells with three biological replicates, it was observed that thedevelopment of resistance to doxorubicin is a multi‑directed process. The number and composition of the differentially expressed proteins varied, in addition tothe pathways involved in chemoresistance, leading to only a small number ofproteins and pathways being commonly regulated in all the MEAs. The proteins 60S ribosomal export protein NMD3 and 4F2 cell‑surface antigen heavy chain (SLC3A2)were identified to be the most promising differentially expressed targets; thegene ontology term 'apoptotic signaling pathway' was reduced and 'cell redoxhomeostasis' was upregulated. Based on the present findings in vitro, it may behypothesized that the development of resistance in patients is an even morecomplex process, emphasizing the need for further investigations of resistancedevelopment in the clinic to eventually improve patient outcomes.DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3781 PMID: 30066829
