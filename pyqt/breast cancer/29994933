[Epub aheadof print]Novel Sternal Reconstruction With Custom Three-Dimensional-Printed TitaniumPoreStar Prosthesis.Tran MD(1), Varzaly JA(1), Chan JCY(1), Caplash Y(2), Worthington MG(1).Author information: (1)From the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery and.(2)Department of Plastic Surgery, The Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide,Australia.Resection of sternal tumors can leave large defects, which exposes majormediastinal structures, and can affect respiratory mechanics. If feasible,resection is potentially a complex reconstructive challenge to restore normal andfunctional anatomy using conventional techniques. We report the first Australian use of a three-dimensional-printed titanium and PoreStar prosthesis in a39-year-old woman for reconstruction after major surgical resection of thesternum for metastatic breast cancer. The patient successfully underwent excisionof the sternum and costal cartilages as well as implantation of the prosthesis.We conclude that three-dimensional-printed prostheses are technically feasible todeliver excellent cosmetic result.DOI: 10.1097/IMI.0000000000000511 PMID: 29994933
