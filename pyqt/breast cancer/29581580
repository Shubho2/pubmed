Recent studieshave shown that H19 enhances cancer invasion and metastasis; however, its rolesin cancer remain controversial. In the current study, H19 exhibited the secondlargest increase (82.4-fold) and represented the only non-protein coding geneamong 11 genes identified that were elevated over 10-fold inlung-metastasis-derived pancreatic cancer cells compared with their parentalcells using a mouse metastatic model. Subsequently, we further clarified theroles of H19 in pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis using in vitro and invivo techniques. In situ hybridization showed that H19 was detected in 23 of 139 invasive ductal carcinomas (17%), and that H19 expression positively correlatedwith higher histological grades (P < 0.0001). Overexpression of H19 in PANC-1pancreatic cancer cells induced higher motilities, whereas H19 inhibition usingshRNA and siRNA showed opposite results; however, cell growth rates were notimpacted. Intravenous injection of H19 shRNA vector-transfected PANC-1 cellsyielded marked inhibition of metastasis in the liver and lungs of immunodeficientmice. These findings suggest that H19 has important roles in pancreatic cancermetastasis, and that inhibition of H19 represents a novel candidate forpancreatic cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41374-018-0048-1 PMID: 29581580
