A better understanding ofwomen's support needs after surgery would improve patient care.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify patients' support needs afterBR.METHODS: In a retrospective study design, 21 participants described their supportexperiences after BR, including their sources of support and the impact ofsupport on their recovery in a semistructured interview. Transcriptions of theinterviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.RESULTS: Four support needs were identified and were composed of elements ofinstrumental, emotional, and informational support. These needs were addressed tovarying degrees by healthcare providers, family members, and other women who had BR experience.CONCLUSION: Women's experience of BR and their ability to cope are markedlybetter when their support needs are effectively addressed. Greater attention totheir needs for support has the potential to improve patient care.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses play a pivotal role in providing information towomen who are recovering from BR. Improved access to communication channelsbetween nurses and patients would likely improve patients' support experiences.In addition, nurses can assess the women's specific support needs and partnerwith families to help them understand how best to support women duringrecovery.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of theCreative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0(CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
