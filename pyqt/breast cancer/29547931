Therefore, we conducted a prospective evaluation of body size and the risk of breast cancer among BRCA mutation carriers.Methods: Current height and body mass index (BMI) at age 18 were determined from baseline questionnaires. Current BMI and weight change since age 18 werecalculated from updated biennial follow-up questionnaires. Cox proportionalhazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidenceinterval (CI).Results: Among 3734 BRCA mutation carriers, there were 338 incident breastcancers over a mean follow-up of 5.5 years. There was no association betweenheight, current BMI or weight change and breast cancer risk. Women with BMI atage 18 ≥22.1 kg/m2 had a decreased risk of developing post-menopausal breastcancer compared with women with a BMI at age 18 between 18.8 and 20.3 kg/m2 (HR0.49; 95% CI 0.30-0.82; P = 0.006). BMI at age 18 was not associated with risk ofpre-menopausal breast cancer.Conclusions: There was no observed association between height, current BMI andweight change and risk of breast cancer. The inverse relationship between greaterBMI at age 18 and post-menopausal breast cancer further supports a role of early rather than current or adulthood exposures for BRCA-associated breast cancerdevelopment. Future studies with longer follow-up and additional measures ofadiposity are necessary to confirm these findings.DOI: 10.1093/ije/dyy039 PMCID: PMC6005062 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29547931
