Citral has been reported to show cytotoxiceffect on various cancer cell lines. However, the potential of citral tospecifically target the drug resistant breast cancer cells has not yet beentested, which was the focus of our current study.METHODS: The cytotoxic activity of citral was first tested on MDA-MB-231 cells invitro by MTT assay. Subsequently, spheroids of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cellswere developed and treated with citral at different concentrations. Doxorubicin, cisplatin and tamoxifen were used as positive controls to evaluate the drugresistance phenotype of MDA-MB-231 spheroids. In addition, apoptosis study wasperformed using AnnexinV/7AAD flowcytometry. Aldefluor assay was also carried outto examine whether citral could inhibit the ALDH-positive population, while thepotential mechanism of the effect of citral was carried out by using quantitativereal time- PCR followed by western blotting analysis.RESULTS: Citral was able to inhibit the growth of the MDA-MB-231 spheroids whencompared to a monolayer culture of MDA-MB-231 cells at a lower IC50 value. Toconfirm the inhibition of spheroid self-renewal capacity, the primary spheroidswere then cultured to additional passages in the absence of citral. A significantreduction in the number of secondary spheroids were formed, suggesting thereduction of self-renewal capacity of these aldehyde dehydrogenase positive(ALDH+) drug resistant spheroids. Moreover, the AnnexinV/7AAD resultsdemonstrated that citral induced both early and late apoptotic changes in adose-dependent manner compared to the vehicle control. Furthermore, citraltreated spheroids showed lower cell renewal capacity compared to the vehiclecontrol spheroids in the mammosphere formation assay. Gene expression studiesusing quantitative real time PCR and Western blotting assays showed that citralwas able to suppress the self-renewal capacity of spheroids and downregulate the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that citral could be a potential new agent which can eliminate drug-resistant breast cancer cells in a spheroid model via inducingapoptosis.DOI: 10.1186/s12906-018-2115-y PMCID: PMC5809808PMID: 29433490  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
