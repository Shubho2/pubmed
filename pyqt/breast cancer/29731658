Genetic tests to screen formarker SNPs are available to adjust the drug dose of oncologicals to thepatient's needs. However, it is unclear whether the positive effects outbalancethe increased costs or even lead to an overall cost reduction. This verypragmatic analysis used three frequently used oncologicals for the treatment ofbreast cancer to evaluate whether preemptive pharmacogenetic testing may have acost-reducing impact on health care spending in the Swiss health care system. Ourresults indicate that oncopharmacogenetics might help to reduce health care costs(ie, by avoiding adverse drug effects) and to increase efficiency of drugs inoncologic patients.DOI: 10.2147/PGPM.S154368 PMCID: PMC5923251PMID: 29731658
