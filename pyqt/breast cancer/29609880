This networkmeta-analysis (NMA) synthesized available evidence on progression-free survival(PFS) with first-line ETs for postmenopausal HR+/HER2- mBC.METHODS: A systematic literature review identified randomized controlled trialsof first-line ETs. Pairwise hazard ratios and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were obtained via a Bayesian NMA model. Subgroup NMAs were conducted among lateprogressors (disease-free interval ≥12 months from completion of [neo] adjuvanttherapy with letrozole or anastrozole at the time of randomization) and de novopatients, defined as patients whose initial BC diagnosis is mBC.FINDINGS: Five trials and 5 regimens (ribociclib + an aromatase inhibitor [AI][LEE + AI], palbociclib + AI [Pal + AI], fulvestrant 250 mg + AI [Ful250 + AI],fulvestrant 500 mg [Ful500], and AI) were selected. LEE + AI, Pal + AI, Ful250 + AI, and Ful500 had significantly longer PFS versus AI (95% CrI upper-bound ≤1).LEE + AI had a 30% and 29%, and Pal + AI had a 31% and 30%, reduced hazard ofprogression or death versus Ful250 + AI and Ful500 (95% CrI upper-bound ≤1),respectively. The probability of being the most efficacious was 46% for LEE + AI and 54% for Pal + AI. In subgroup analyses among late progressors, LEE + AI had a4% reduced hazard of progression or death versus Pal + AI but was notstatistically significant. In the de novo analysis, Pal + AI and LEE + AI had a29% and 40% reduced hazard of progression or death versus Ful500, respectively,but were not statistically significant. In both subgroup analyses, all therapies had significantly longer PFS compared with AI.IMPLICATIONS: Pal + AI, LEE + AI, Ful250 + AI, or Ful500 as first-line treatment for HR+/HER2- mBC had longer PFS than AI alone. Given the lack of head-to-headclinical trials comparing the efficacy of recently approved first-line ETs forHR+/HER2- mBC, these results have important clinical implications for thetreatment of HR+/HER2- mBC in the first-line setting.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.
