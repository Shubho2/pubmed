A purposive sampling strategy was implemented to compare outcomes of newly diagnosed breast cancer women who received standard of care thatincluded breast care nurse counseling sessions and written materials to women whoreceived standard of care plus a supplement educational video. Knowledge andanxiety scores were collected at baseline and 2 weeks post-operatively.Satisfaction with decision (SWD) on the nature of surgery was gathered 2 weeksafter surgery.RESULTS: Sixty-two subjects were recruited in a Singapore tertiary cancer center with a cohort of 32 women in the non-video group and 30 women in the video group.There was a statistically significant interaction effect of group and time(p = .008), wherein knowledge increased for both groups, although the increasewas steeper for the video group. Both groups had significantly lower anxiety atpost-implementation compared to pre-implementation (p < .001). There were nodifferences in SWD scores in both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Use of an additional video-based education significantly increasedbreast cancer knowledge levels among women in the educational video group. Nursesand healthcare professionals should focus on identifying individual informationalneeds based on surgical options to provide personalize care and transfer thenecessary knowledge in empowering woman's decision-making process on her natureof breast surgery.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4258-2 PMID: 29777379
