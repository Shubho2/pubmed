China.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a common type of breast malignancy withhigh a propensity for metastasis and locoregional recurrence. The aim of thepresent study was to investigate the expression of aquaporin (AQP) 3 and AQP5,analyze their association with clinicopathological parameters and explore theirclinical significance in tissue samples from patients with TNBC.Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression patterns of AQP3 and AQP5 in 96 patients with TNBC who underwent surgery between 2007 and 2012. AQP3and AQP5 were expressed primarily in the membrane and cytoplasm of tumor cellswithin TNBC tissues. AQP3 and AQP5 expression was notably stronger in carcinomatissue compared with adjacent normal tissue. Overexpression of AQP3 and AQP5 was significantly associated with tumor size, lymph node status and localrelapse/distant metastasis. In addition, aberrant overexpression of AQP5 wasobserved more frequently in TNBC tissues with higher Ki-67 expression than inthose with lower Ki-67 expression. In univariate analysis, patients with TNBCwith high AQP3 and AQP5 expression demonstrated poorer 5-year disease-freesurvival and overall survival compared with patients with low AQP3 and AQP5expression. In multivariate analysis, the combined expression of AQP3 and AQP5was an independent prognostic marker in patients with TNBC. The results of thepresent study suggest that the overexpression of AQP3 and AQP5 may serve as anovel therapeutic marker in patients with TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8955 PMCID: PMC6036574PMID: 30013662
