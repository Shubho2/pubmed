The purpose of thisstudy was to determine whether long-term storage of unstained slides at -80°Cwould impact the staining intensity and expression distribution of markers usedto molecularly subtype breast cancer specimens [estrogen receptor (ER), humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), cytokeratin 5 (CK5), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and Ki67]. The staining pattern of previously unstainedbreast tumor slides (n=39 to 64) stored at -80°C for a minimum of 9.93 years(avg., 12.8 y) was compared with the staining pattern of fresh cut slides fromthe same tumors. The Allred scoring method was used to score ER (0 to 2,negative; 3 to 8, positive), CK5 (≥4, positive), and EGFR (≥4, positive).ASCO/CAP guidelines were used to assess HER2 (0/1+, 2+, or 3+). Ki67 scores were determined based on the proportion of cells stained of any intensity, with 20%staining used as a cut-off. Agreement was assessed using concordance rates andchance-corrected agreement statistics. The chance-corrected agreements were asfollows: 0.94 (38/39) for ER, 0.92 (53/55) for CK5, 0.87 (61/64) for EGFR, 0.86(37/39) for HER2, and 0.67 (46/54) for Ki67. Long-term storage of cut unstainedslides at -80°C does not significantly impact the scoring interpretation of ER,CK5, EGFR, and HER2.DOI: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000579 PMID: 29553968
