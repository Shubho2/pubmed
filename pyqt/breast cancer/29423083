In our study, betulinic acid (BA), a kind of pentacyclic triterpenoid compoundderived from birch trees, was evaluated for its anti-metastasis activity in vitroand in vivo. BA decreased the viability of three breast cancer cell lines andmarkedly impaired cell migration and invasion. In addition, BA could inhibit the activation of stat3 and FAK which resulted in a reduction of matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs), and increase of the MMPs inhibitor (TIMP-2)expression. Moreover, in our animal experiment, intraperitoneal administration of10 mg/kg/day BA suppressed 4T1 tumor growth and blocked formation of pulmonarymetastases without obvious side effects. Furthermore, histological andimmunohistochemical analyses showed a decrease in MMP-9 positive cells, MMP-2positive cells and Ki-67 positive cells and an increase in cleaved caspase-3positive cells upon BA administration. Notably, BA reduced the number ofmyeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the lungs and tumors. Interestingly, in our caudal vein model, BA also obviously suppressed 4T1 tumor pulmonarymetastases. These findings suggested that BA might be a potential agent forinhibiting the growth and metastasis of breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23376 PMCID: PMC5790500PMID: 29423083
