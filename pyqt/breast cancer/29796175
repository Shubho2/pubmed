To inhibit the TGF-β pathway, we investigated a tumor-targeting TGF-βreceptor blocker, TTB, and its role in tumor progress. The targeted TTB comprisedof the extracellular domain of the TGF-β receptor II, the endoglin domain ofTGF-β receptor III, and the human immuno-globin IgG1 constant fragment (Fc). Toenhance tumor microenvironment targeting, a RGD peptide was fused at theN-terminal of TTB. The targeted TTB exhibited potent TGF-β neutralizationactivities, and inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion as well as colonyformation. In xenograft models, the TTB had potent tumor inhibition activities.The TTB also attenuated the TGF-β1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and epithelialto mesenchymal transformation (EMT), and suppressed breast cancer metastasis.Thus, the TTB is an effective TGF-β blocker with a potential for blockingexcessive TGF-β induced pathogenesis in vivo.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24562 PMCID: PMC5955403PMID: 29796175
