The patients underwentpre-operative diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3.0 Tesla.The relationship between DTI parameters and tumor size, histologic and nucleargrade, axillary lymph node status, lymphovascular and perineural invasion status,estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), CERB-B2, and Ki-67 wereanalyzed.RESULTS: Patients with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.018; p < 0.05) and/orlymphovascular invasion (p = 0.001; p < 0.01) and/or histologic grade 3 tumors(p < 0.05) had statistically significantly low MD values. There was astatistically significant relationship between ER and MD (r = 0.452, p < 0.01),PR and MD (p = 0.001, p < 0.01); CERB-B2 and RA (p = 0.047, p < 0.05); Ki-67 and RA (p = 0.026; p < 0.05); Ki-67 and VR (p = 0.021; p < 0.05); and lymphovascular invasion and FA (p = 0.045, p < 0.05) values.CONCLUSION: DTI parameters of malignant masses in breast cancer patientscorrelate with tumor size, lymph node status, histologic grade, lymphovascularinvasion, Ki-67, CERB B2, ER, and PR.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
