During herlast follow-up visit, she reported the occurrence of painful anterior chest hump.Physical examination showed hard immobile mass at the level of themanubriosternal joint. The patient underwent sternoclavicular CT scan, whichobjectified expansive osteolytic lesion centered upon the sternal manubriuminvading the soft tissues (A, B). The biopsy revealed malignant papillaryepithelial tumor expressing pancytokeratin and CK7. Patient's profile suggestedthe presence of a metastasis from cholangiocarcinoma or osteophilic tumor.Gynecological examination, associated with mammogram and breast ultrasound,excluded a gynecological origin. The diagnosis of thyroid tumor was excluded onultrasound. Chest CT scan showed multiple secondary pulmonary nodules. Abdominal angioscanner revealed the presence of a tissutal hepatic mass measuring 6 cminvading the portal bifurcation with portal vein thrombosis, suggestinghepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (C). Given the discrepancy betweenanatomopathological data and morphological data, immunohistochemical study of theanti-Hep-Par-1 was performed, showing antibody expression on tumor cells. Thediagnosis of manubriosternal metastasis from poorly differentiated hepatocellularcarcinoma was retained. The patient was recommended to undergo chemotherapy. Bonemetastases revealing HCC are exceptional. However, HCC should be suspected inpatients with lytic bone lesion, especially in patients with chronic liverdisease. Given its poor prognosis, treatment is based on palliative therapy with the aim of improving mainly the quality of life of patients.DOI: 10.11604/pamj.2017.28.146.13374 PMCID: PMC5847125PMID: 29541294  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
