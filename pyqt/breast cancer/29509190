Interaction proteomics by tandem affinity purification coupled to massspectrometry was previously applied in BC cells to identify proteins acting inconcert with ERβ to control key cellular functions, including gene transcription,RNA splicing and post-transcriptional mRNA regulation. These studies revealed an involvement of RNA in ERβ interactome assembly and functions. By applying native protein complex purification followed by nano LC-MS/MS before and after in vitro RNA removal, we generated a large dataset of newly identified nuclear ERβinteractors, including a subset associating with the receptor via RNA bridging.These datasets will be useful to investigate further the role of ERβ, nuclearRNAs and the other proteins identified here in BC and other cell types.DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2018.31 PMCID: PMC5839158PMID: 29509190
