[Epub ahead of print]Menopausal hormone therapy: a better and safer future.Davey DA(1).Author information: (1)a Faculty of Health Sciences , University of Cape Town , Western Cape , South Africa.Major advances in menopause hormone therapy (MHT) hold promise in the future ofbetter and safer care for women at and after the menopause. The principaladvances are: (1) the critical window or 'window of opportunity' in the 10â€‰years or so after the menopause, during which the benefits of MHT in healthy womenexceed any risks; (2) use of transdermal instead of oral administration ofestrogen to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism; (c) investigation of theuse of oral micronized progesterone (MP) and vaginal MP to prevent endometrialhyperplasia and carcinoma without any increased risk of breast cancer and venous thromboembolism in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens; vaginal MP prevents endometrial proliferation in the short term but the long-term effects in MHTremain to be established; (4) investigation into the use of intrauterinelevonorgestrel-releasing devices (LNG-IUDs), which are an attractive form of MHT in perimenopausal women, providing contraception and reducing uterine bleeding,although the risk of breast cancer with LNG-IUDs requires clarification. Women inthe future can look forward to a symptom-free menopause and to safer and morebeneficial MHT.DOI: 10.1080/13697137.2018.1439915 PMID: 29526116
