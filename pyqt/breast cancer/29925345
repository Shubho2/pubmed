Patients who had complete response, partialresponse, or stable disease underwent switch maintenance therapy with eribulin(1.4 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 followed by 1-week drug holiday). Theprimary endpoint was time to treatment failure (TTF) for ISMT.RESULTS: Fifty-one eligible patients (median age: 66 years; range: 35-74) wereenrolled: 19 (37.3%) and 32 (62.7%) had stage IV and recurrence, respectively, 42(82.4%) had visceral metastases, and 45 (88.2%) received eribulin-38 of whomshowed disease progression, and 40 (78.4%) underwent post therapy. Median TTF was9.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.3-11.1), median progression-freesurvival was 10.7 months (95% CI: 9.6-11.8), and median overall survival was20.0 months (95% CI: 16.0-24.0). Relative dose intensity was 97.7% (range:33.3-100.0) for induction therapy and was 83.3% (range: 49.3-100.6%) for eribulinmaintenance therapy. The most common adverse event was alopecia (51 [100%]) ininduction therapy and was peripheral sensory neuropathy (37 [82.2%]) in eribulin maintenance therapy. Eribulin was effective with manageable tolerability.CONCLUSIONS: ISMT may be a promising therapeutic option for patients with MBC.TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000015971 .
