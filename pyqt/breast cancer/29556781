This is the firstobservational study in which adjustments for a comprehensive set of prognosticfactors, adjuvant therapies, mode of detection, and comorbidities were possibleto investigate OS, BCS, as well as recurrence risk of patients undergoingBCT + RT, MT + RT, or MT.METHODS: Women aged 50-74 years at diagnosis of early-stage invasive breastcancer (I-IIIa) between 2001 and 2005 at the German population-based case-controlstudy (MARIE study) were recruited and followed prospectively as a case cohortuntil 2015. Kaplan-Meier estimates and stepwise adjusted multivariable Cox modelswere used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).RESULTS: The 2762 patients included were followed up for a median of 11.9 years(95% CI 11.8-12.0). 74.2% of patients underwent BCT + RT; 10.3% MT + RT and 15.6%MT alone. Compared to patients treated with MT alone, patients treated withBCT + RT showed non-statistically significant improved OS (HR 0.79, 95% CI0.61-1.02), BCS (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55-1.12), and no difference in recurrencerisks (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.74-1.37). For patients treated with MT + RT, there were no differences in OS (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.75-1.50), BCS (HR 1.17, 95% CI0.75-1.82), or recurrence risk (HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.89-1.97).CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with early-stage breast cancer, clinical outcomesmore than 10 years after diagnosis did not differ between the primary treatmentoptions BCT + RT, MT + RT versus MT alone after full adjustment.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4754-6 PMID: 29556781
