Email: s.hamzah.mousavie@gmail.comBackground: Due to wide clinical differences in the various pathological types ofbreast cancer and also close associations between disease prognosis and molecularsubtypes, relationships of the latter with traditional risk factors have beensuggested. Hence, the present study aimed to assess any associations. Methods:This bi-center cross-sectional study was performed on 800 consecutive women with known breast cancer referred to two Comprehensive Cancer Centers in Tehranbetween 2006 and 2016. Baseline information related to reproductive risk profilesas well as pathological tumor diagnosis and molecular subtypes determined usingimmunohistochemical analysis by immune-staining for ER, PR, and HER2 moleculeswere collected by reviewing hospital records. Results: Of 800 samples includedfor immunohistochemical analysis, 314 (39.3%) were diagnosed as of Luminal Asubtype, 107 (13.4%) as Luminal B subtype, 153 (19.1%) as HER-2 over-expressing, and 226 (28.3%) as triple negative. Among all reproductive risk factors initiallyassessed, young age was associated with HER-2 over-expression, greater tumor sizeand a history of abortion with the luminal B subtype, lower age at pregnancy withthe luminal A subtype, and lower gravidity and a shorter duration ofbreastfeeding with the triple negative subtype. Conclusion: Each molecularsubtype of breast cancer in our population may be associated with specificreproductive risk factors.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.7.1767 PMID: 30049185
