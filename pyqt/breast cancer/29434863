The present study aimed to identify a common set of genes which may serve asindicators of important molecular and cellular processes in breast, prostate and lung cancer. Six microarray gene expression profile datasets [GSE45827, GSE48984,GSE19804, GSE10072, GSE55945 and GSE26910 (two datasets for each cancer)] and oneRNA-Seq expression dataset (GSE62944 including all three cancer types), weredownloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressedgenes (DEGs) were identified in each individual cancer type using the LIMMAstatistical package in R, and then a comparison of the resulting gene lists wasperformed to identify common DEGs across cancer types. This analysis wasperformed for microarray and RNA-Seq datasets individually, revealing a set of 62and 1,290 differentially expressed genes respectively, which may be associatedwith the three cancers. Out of these genes, 44 were common to both analyses, and hence termed key genes. Gene Ontology functional annotation, Kyoto Encyclopediaof Genes and Genomes pathway mapping and literature citations were used toconfirm the role of the key genes in cancer. Finally, the heterogeneity ofexpression of the key genes was explored using the I2 statistic (meta package in R). The results demonstrated non-heterogeneous expression of 6 out of the 44 key genes, whereas the remaining genes exhibited significant heterogeneity inexpression across microarray samples. In conclusion, the identified DEGs may playimportant roles in the pathogenesis of breast, prostate and lung cancer and maybe used as biomarkers for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeuticstrategies.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7508 PMCID: PMC5776944PMID: 29434863
