However, many breast cancers areresistant or relapse after treatment. Here, we investigated conjunctivechemotherapy-triggered events occurring systemically and locally, potentiallypromoting a cancer stem-like cell (CSC) phenotype and contributing to tumorrelapse.Experimental Design: We started by comparing the effect of paired pre-and post-NT patient sera on the CSC properties of breast cancer cells. Using celllines, patient-derived xenograft models, and primary tumors, we investigated the regulation of CSCs and tumor progression by chemotherapy-induced factors.Results:In human patients and mice, we detected a therapy-induced CSC-stimulatoryactivity in serum, which was attributed to therapy-associated monocytosis leadingto systemic elevation of monocyte chemoattractant proteins (MCP). The post-NThematopoietic regeneration in the bone marrow highlighted both alteredmonocyte-macrophage differentiation and biased commitment of stimulatedhematopoietic stem cells toward monocytosis. Chemotherapeutic agents also induce monocyte expression of MCPs through a JNK-dependent mechanism. Genetic andpharmacologic inhibitions of the MCP-CCR2 pathway blocked chemotherapy's adverse effect on CSCs. Levels of nuclear Notch and ALDH1 were significantly elevated in primary breast cancers following NT, whereas higher levels of CCR2 in pre-NTtumors were associated with a poor response to NT.Conclusions: Our data establisha mechanism of chemotherapy-induced cancer stemness by linking the cellularevents in the bone marrow and tumors, and suggest pharmacologic inhibition ofCCR2 as a potential cotreatment during conventional chemotherapy in neoadjuvantand adjuvant settings.
