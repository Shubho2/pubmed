The use of allogeneic T-cell grafts will improve its applicability andversatility provided that inherent allogeneic responses are controlled. T-cellactivation is finely regulated by multiple signaling molecules that aretranscriptionally controlled by epigenetic mechanisms. Here we report thatinhibiting DOT1L, a histone H3-lysine 79 methyltransferase, alleviates allogeneicT-cell responses. DOT1L inhibition reduces miR-181a expression, which in turnincreases the ERK phosphatase DUSP6 expression and selectively ameliorateslow-avidity T-cell responses through globally suppressing T-cellactivation-induced gene expression alterations. The inhibition of DOT1L or DUSP6 overexpression in T cells attenuates the development of graft-versus-hostdisease, while retaining potent antitumor activity in xenogeneic and allogeneicadoptive immunotherapy models. These results suggest that DOT1L inhibition mayenable the safe and effective use of allogeneic antitumor T cells by suppressing unwanted immunological reactions in adoptive immunotherapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04262-0 PMCID: PMC5954061PMID: 29765028
