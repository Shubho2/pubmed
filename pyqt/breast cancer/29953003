This retrospective cohort study developed a nomogram to predict thecancer-specific survival (CSS) of T1 breast cancer patients with and without ASand estimate the survival benefit of AS in these patients.We used surveillance,epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database to identify 232,195 breast cancerpatients with T1 tumors diagnosed between 1990 and 2008. In the training cohort, we used the Kaplan-Meier method and the competing risk analysis, with non-CSS as the competing risk, to screen for prognostic factors for CSS. A nomogram topredict the CSS, with receiving AS or not as one of the predictors, was developedand externally validated, using the C-index and calibration plots. The survivalbenefit of AS can be estimated by the difference of 2 predicted CSS, when thepatient was considered as having and not having AS.With a median follow-up of 109months, the CSS of the study population were 96.3%, 92.3%, and 88.5% at 5, 10,and 15 years, respectively. Significant predictors for CSS identified in thetraining cohort were used to develop a nomogram, which was validated internally[C-index = 0.707, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.702-0.712] and externally(C-index = 0.704, 95% CI 0.698-0.710). The nomogram was well calibrated. Withthis nomogram, AS was predicted to have less than 2% benefit of 5-, 10-, and15-year CSS in 60.6% (140,599/232,195), 15.5% (36,074/232,195), and 8.6%(20,043/232,195) of the entire study population, respectively.The new nomogramcan accurately predict the CSS of T1 breast cancer patients, and also be able to estimate the survival benefit of AS in these patients. Prospective studies areneeded to confirm our findings.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011273 PMCID: PMC6039583PMID: 29953003  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
