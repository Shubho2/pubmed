FUL was administered to a total of 41 patients-33 with recurrent and 8 with Stage IV cancer-from January 2012 to September 2016. The median number of lines that used FUL was 3, the median timeto treatment failure(TTF)was 7 months, the overall response rate(RR)was 19.5%,and the clinical benefit rate(CBR)was 53.6%. Our result was similar to those ofthe FIRST and the FALCON studies, which showed a decrease in RR after thefourth-line. With regard to RR, FUL seemed to provide better results atCthird-lines of treatment. While a shorter TTF was seen in the cases with livermetastases, a longer TTF was seen in the cases with soft tissue metastases.Therefore, it may be helpful to consider the site of metastasis when predictingthe effects of FUL.PMID: 30026420
