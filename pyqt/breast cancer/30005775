PMRT decreases locoregional recurrence and may improve overallsurvival in patients with tumors over 5 cm or positive lymph nodes. As novelcancer therapies improve survival in breast cancer, the role of radiation therapyis evolving. Individualized recommendations for PMRT dependent on pathologicresponse after neoadjuvant systemic therapy are under investigation. This review summarizes the role of PMRT during breast cancer therapy and discusses openquestions that may change the landscape of future breast cancer treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
