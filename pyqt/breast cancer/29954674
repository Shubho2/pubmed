Pathologic examination after complete surgical excision wasthe reference standard. Tumors were divided into 4 subtypes on the basis ofexpression of hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Tumor enhancement was assessed on early and late phases of MRI. MRInegativity was divided into radiologic complete response (rCR, complete absenceof enhancement on both early and late phases) and near-rCR (no discernible early enhancement but observed late enhancement).RESULTS: Ninety (25.5%) of 353 patients experienced pathologic complete response.When analyzing the data of all patients, sensitivity of MRI was higher for rCRversus near-rCR (97.72% vs. 90.49%, P < .0001), whereas specificity was lower forrCR versus near-rCR (44.44% vs. 72.22%, P < .0001). Accuracy was equivalent(84.14% vs. 85.84%). In HR-HER2+ tumors, 100% sensitivity and negative predictivevalue were achieved by assessing early enhancement only. In HR+HER2- tumors,sensitivity of MRI was higher for rCR versus near-rCR (96.12% vs. 86.82%, P =.0005).CONCLUSION: Diagnostic performance of MRI after NAC differs in accordance withthe subtypes and threshold of MRI negativity. MRI assessment with considerationof tumor subtypes is required, along with standardization of MRI interpretationcriteria in the NAC setting.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
