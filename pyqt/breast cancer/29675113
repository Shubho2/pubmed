BRAF-activated non-protein coding RNA(BANCR) is a novel and potential regulator of cancer cell proliferation andmigration. However, little is known regarding the role of BANCR in papillarythyroid cancer (PTC). The current study used quantitative PCR to demonstrate thatBANCR was significantly downregulated in 60 paired PTC tissues compared withnormal tissues. In addition, BANCR was significantly correlated with lymph nodemetastasis (p = 0.02). Furthermore, Cell Counting Kits and Transwell assays were used to demonstrate that knocking down BANCR with short hairpin RNA (shRNA)transfection significantly promoted the proliferation and invasion of PTC celllines. The flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis and the cell cycle revealed thatthe overexpression of BANCR inhibited cancer cell proliferation and invasion,which was associated with the induction of cell-cycle G2/M phase arrest andincreased apoptosis. Moreover, western blotting was used to show that the MAPKand PI3K-Akt pathways were aberrantly activated during BANCR-mediated PTC cellproliferation and migration. These findings revealed that BANCR functions as atumor suppressor during thyroid carcinogenesis.DOI: 10.7150/jca.20150 PMCID: PMC5907680PMID: 29675113
