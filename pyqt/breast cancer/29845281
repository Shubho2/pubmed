China.MicroRNA‑205 (miR‑205) has been reported to be downregulated, and serves criticalroles in the pathogenesis and progression of several types of cancer, includingbreast, prostate and lung cancer. However, the underlying mechanism of miR‑205 inthyroid cancer remains unclear. In the present study, it was demonstrated thatthe expression of miR‑205 was reduced in thyroid cancer tissues compared withnon‑cancer tissues. In addition, miR‑205‑knockdown models in the BHT‑101 cellline and ectopic expression models in the 8505‑C cell line were used to measurethe biological functions of miR‑205. The results indicated that miR‑205 inhibitedcertain aspects of thyroid cancer, including cell proliferation, migration andinvasion. Furthermore, Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) was identified as a targetgene of miR‑205 and its expression was negatively correlated with that of miR‑205in thyroid cancer tissues. Depletion of YAP1 partially reduced theanti‑miR‑205‑induced cell growth and invasion. The results of the present studysuggested that the tumor suppressive functions of miR‑205 via targeting YAP1could be a novel target for the treatment of thyroid cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9074 PMID: 29845281
