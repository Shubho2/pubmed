Yet, an increasing number of studies have shown that pregnantfemales are disrupted by endocrine-disrupting chemical exposures, with someeffects that are permanent. Here, we examined the long-term effects of exposureto oxybenzone, an estrogenic chemical found in sunscreen and personal careproducts, on the morphology of the mammary gland in mice exposed during pregnancyand lactation. Female mice were exposed to vehicle or 30, 212, or 3000 µgoxybenzone/kg/d, from pregnancy day 0 until weaning. A nulliparous group,receiving vehicle treatment, was also evaluated. Mammary glands were collected 5 weeks after involution for whole-mount, histological, immunohistochemical, andmolecular analyses. Exposure to 3000 µg oxybenzone/kg/d induced permanent changesto ductal density that was significantly different from both the nulliparous and vehicle groups. The two highest doses of oxybenzone similarly induced anintermediate phenotype for expression of progesterone receptor. A monotonic,dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation was also observed in theoxybenzone-treated females, becoming statistically significant at the highestdose. Finally, oxybenzone exposure induced an intermediate phenotype for Esr1expression in all oxybenzone-treated groups. These data suggest that oxybenzone, at doses relevant to human exposures, produces long-lasting alterations tomammary gland morphology and function. Further studies are needed to determine ifexposure to this chemical during pregnancy and lactation will interfere with the known protection that pregnancy provides against breast cancer.DOI: 10.1210/js.2018-00024 PMCID: PMC6057512PMID: 30057971
