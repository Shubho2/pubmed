Children's AD diagnosis was assessed using parent and pediatrician reportsat 1, 2, and 3 years of age.RESULTS: Complete exposure and outcome data were available for 659 UBCS and 489SPATZ children. In both cohorts, sCD14 concentration was significantly associatedwith breastfeeding frequency (p<0.01). We observed no association between m-sCD14concentration and child AD diagnosis in either study.CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support an association between sCD14concentration in mature breast milk and AD among breastfed children.
