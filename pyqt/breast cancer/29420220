The mechanisms underlying tamoxifenresistance are not fully understood, and no robust biomarker is available toreliably predict those who will be resistant. Here, we study BQ323636.1, a novel splice variant of the NCOR2 gene, and evaluate its efficacy in predictingtamoxifen resistance in patients with breast cancer.Experimental Design: Amonoclonal anti-BQ323636.1 antibody that specifically recognizes the uniqueepitope of this splice variant was generated for in vitro mechanistic studies andfor in vivo analysis by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays of twoindependent cohorts of 358 patients with more than 10 years clinical follow-updata, who had ER-positive primary breast cancer and received adjuvant tamoxifentreatment. An orthotopic mouse model was also used.Results: Overexpression ofBQ323636.1 conferred resistance to tamoxifen in both in vitro and in anorthotopic mouse model. Mechanistically, coimmunoprecipitation showed BQ323636.1 could bind to NCOR2 and inhibit the formation of corepressor complex for thesuppression of ER signaling. Nuclear BQ3232636.1 overexpression in patientssamples was significantly associated with tamoxifen resistance (P = 1.79 × 10-6, sensitivity 52.9%, specificity 72.0%). In tamoxifen-treated patients, nuclearBQ323636.1 overexpression was significantly correlated with cancer metastasis anddisease relapse. Nuclear BQ323636.1 was also significantly associated with pooreroverall survival (P = 1.13 × 10-4) and disease-specific survival (P = 4.02 ×10-5).Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that BQ323636.1 can be a reliablebiomarker to predict tamoxifen resistance in patients with ER-positive breastcancer.
