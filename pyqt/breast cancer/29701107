Women who sought NOcare 2 or more times within the first 2 years postdiagnosis were identified as NOcases. A matched comparison group of breast cancer patients were identified usingthe Western Washington Cancer Surveillance System(CSS).METHODS: A longitudinal cohort design. In addition to self-report data, the CSSprovided data on demographics, stage at the time of diagnosis, and initialtreatment. Oncology medical records were abstracted in order to provideadditional information on standard oncologic treatment for all participants.RESULTS: Cohorts were well matched with regard to demographic, histologic, andprognostic indicators at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 70% of women inboth cohorts received standard oncologic care that met the National ComprehensiveCancer Network guidelines. There were no statistically significant differencesbetween the cohorts in treatment received. Fewer women in the NO cohort withestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer appear to have received antiestrogentherapy.CONCLUSIONS: Women in both cohorts appear to receive guideline-concordant care.However, women who receive adjunctive NO care may be less likely to receiveantiestrogen therapy.DOI: 10.1177/1534735418769007 PMID: 29701107
