Thetumors are mostly located in the thigh, back, and shoulder region. They arerarely found in the supraclavicular fossa. We report a 39-year-old woman whopresented with a painless, slow-growing mass on the left supraclavicular fossafor nearly 15 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an inhomogeneousround mass with a slightly hyperintense signal on fat-suppression T2-weightedimaging that compressed the adjacent tissues and subclavian vessels. Computedtomography angiography indicated a rich blood flow signal. Postoperativehistology confirmed the diagnosis of a hibernating tumor. Although comprehensive imaging is important in the determination of tumor for the size, location, andnature, computed tomography angiography provides clear indication of thevascularity of the tumor, which provides vital clinicopathologic data forsurgeons.DOI: 10.1016/j.radcr.2017.10.024 PMCID: PMC5826731PMID: 29487637
