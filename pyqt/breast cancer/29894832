Electronicaddress: serapgurbuz@marmara.edu.tr.The modification of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) via different routes forbiomolecule binding is an attractive area of research. Waterborne thiol-enesuspension photopolymerization (TESP) can be a useful method for preparingfunctional MNPs. In this study, for the very first time waterborne TESP wasperformed in the presence of MNPs. Neat MNPs were coated and in situfunctionalized with amine groups by using thiol-ene chemistry. Engrailed-2 (EN2) protein, a potential biomarker for various cancers such as prostate cancer,bladder cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer, is known to be a strong binder to a specific DNA sequence (50-TAATTA-30) to regulate transcription. Anti-EN2antibodies were immobilized onto these MNPs by physical adsorption and covalentbonding methods, respectively. The amount of the physically immobilizedantibodies (0.54 mg/g) were found to be lower than the loading of the covalently bonded antibodies (1.775 mg/g). The biomarker level in the artificial solutionsprepared was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Coated MNPs werecharacterized by FTIR, TGA, SEM and STEM. After TESP, the average diameter of theneat magnetite nanoparticles increased from ∼15 nm to ∼32 nm.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
