Given the health advantages of active lifestyles incancer survivorship, as well as the barriers preventing physical activity (e.g., geography, time) there is a need to develop and evaluate effective physicalactivity interventions that employ distance-based (i.e., non face-to-face)approaches. The primary objective of this study was to provide a systematicreview and meta-analysis of present-day (2013-2018) distance-based physicalactivity behaviour change interventions for cancer survivors.METHODS: PubMed and Embase databases were searched from November 2012 up to June 2018. Studies were included that met the following criteria: (1) written inEnglish, (2) included adult cancer survivors (either undergoing or completedtreatment), (3) was a controlled intervention study, and (4) the intervention wasdistance-based (delivered via distance) with no more than one face-to-facecontact. Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) software was used to perform a meta-analysison all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that presented self-reported orobjectively measured physical activity post-intervention means and standarddeviations. Risk of bias for each study was assessed using The Cochrane Risk ofBias Tool.RESULTS: We included 29 RCTs. Across the 29 studies, the total number ofparticipants in these studies was 5218. Median sample size was 95 and ranged from19 to 463. Thirteen (45%) studies focused on breast cancer survivors and medianmonths since diagnosis was 24 (range 6-79). Moderate-to-vigorous intensityphysical activity data from 24 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis andindicated an overall small effect (standardized mean difference) of 0.21 (95% CI 0.11-0.32) favoring the interventions.CONCLUSIONS: Intervention effects on physical activity were small. Drawingconclusions from these trials remains challenging given major limitations ofthese trials included poor methodological design, small sample sizes, lack ofstatistical power, homogeneous samples (e.g., caucasian, young, well-educated),and poor measures of physical activity (e.g., self-report). Relying on thepresent landscape of distance-based programs aiming to facilitate physicalactivity among cancer survivors may not be prudent.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
