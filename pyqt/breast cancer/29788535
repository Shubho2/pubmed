[Epub aheadof print]Cyp2a5 Promoter-based Gene Reporter Assay: A Novel Design of Cell-based Bioassay for Toxicity Prediction.Abu-Bakar A(1)(2), Hu H(3), Lang MA(4).Author information: (1)Faculty of Pharmacy, University Technology MARA Selangor, Puncak Alam,Malaysia.(2)Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Science (QAEHS), The Universityof Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.(3)Pharmacogenetics Section, Reproductive and Developmental Biology Laboratory,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes ofHealth, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA.(4)Alaric-Consultants, Centre for Molecular Genetics, Espoo, Finland.The murine cytochrome P450 2a5 (Cyp2a5) gene is regulated by complex interactionsof various stress-activated transcription factors (TFs). Elevated Cyp2a5transcription under chemical-induced stress conditions is achieved by interplaybetween the various TFs - including as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) andnuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 wild-type (Nrf2) - at the'stress-responding' cluster of response elements on the Cyp2a5 promoter, as well as through mRNA stabilization mediated by interaction of the stress-activatedheterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) with the 3'-UTR of theCYP2A5 mRNA. We designed a unique toxicity pathway-based reporter assay toinclude regulatory regions from both the 5' and the 3' untranslated regions ofCyp2a5 in a luciferase reporter plasmid to reflect in vivo responses to chemical insult. Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were stably transfected withpGL4.38-Cyp2a5_Wt3k (wild-type) or mutant - pGL4.38-Cyp2a5_StREMut andpGL4.38-Cyp2a5_XREMut - reporter gene to monitor chemical-induced cellularresponse mediated by AhR and Nrf2 signalling. The recombinant cells were treated with representative of AhR agonist, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, brominated flame retardant, fluorosurfactant, aromatic organic compound and metal, todetermine the sensitivity of the Cyp2a5 promoter-based gene reporter assays tochemical insults by measuring the LC50 and EC50 of the respective chemicals. The three assays are sensitive to sublethal cellular responses of chemicals, which isan ideal feature for toxicity pathway-based bioassay for toxicity prediction. Thewild-type reporter responded well to chemicals that activate crosstalk betweenthe AhR and Nrf2, whilst the mutant reporters effectively gauge cellular responsedriven by either Nrf2/StRE or AhR/XRE signalling. Thus, the three gene reporterassays could be used tandemly to determine the predominant toxicity pathway of a given compound.© 2018 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former NordicPharmacological Society).DOI: 10.1111/bcpt.13046 PMID: 29788535
