Near infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is ahighly selective tumor treatment that employs an antibody-photo-absorberconjugate which is activated by NIR light. NIR-PIT is in clinical trials inpatients with recurrent head and neck cancers using cetuximab-IR700 as theconjugate. However, its use has otherwise been restricted to mouse models. Thisis an effort to explore larger animal models with NIR-PIT. We describe the use ofa recombinant canine anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb), can225IgG, conjugatedto the photo-absorber, IR700DX, in three EGFR expressing canine transitional cellcarcinoma (TCC) cell lines as a prelude to possible canine clinical studies.Can225-IR700 conjugate showed specific binding and cell-specific killing afterNIR-PIT on EGFR expressing cells in vitro. In the in vivo study, can225-IR700conjugate demonstrated accumulation of the fluorescent conjugate with hightumor-to-background ratio. Tumor-bearing mice were separated into 4 groups: (1)no treatment; (2) 100 µg of can225-IR700 i.v. only; (3) NIR light exposure only; (4) 100 µg of can225-IR700 i.v., NIR light exposure. Tumor growth wassignificantly inhibited by NIR-PIT treatment compared with the other groups (p < 0.001), and significantly prolonged survival was achieved (p < 0.001 vs. othergroups) in the treatment groups. In conclusion, NIR-PIT with can225-IR700 is apromising treatment for canine EGFR-expressing cancers, including invasivetransitional cell carcinoma in pet dogs, that could provide a pathway totranslation to humans.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24876 PMCID: PMC5922375PMID: 29721181
