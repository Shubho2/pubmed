Whether such resultsare observed in real-world population is unknown. In this hospital-based data, wereport the survival outcomes of patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy versus those who did not.METHODS: Using the National Cancer Data Base, we evaluated a cohort of 47,358women with newly diagnosed breast cancer between 2004 and 2011 who underwent alumpectomy and antihormonal therapy with the following criteria: age ≥70 years,clinical stage I, estrogen receptor positive, and negative margins. Patients werestratified into 2 groups: (1) radiation therapy and (2) no radiation therapy.Propensity score matching was used to compensate for differences in demographicand clinical characteristics of the patients. Univariate and multivariablesurvival analysis were employed to determine factors associated with overallsurvival.RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival after propensity score matching was 87.2%for radiation therapy and 79.4% for no radiation therapy (P < .0001). The median survival time was 113.7 months for radiation therapy and 105.2 months for noradiation therapy. After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors, therisk of overall deaths was significantly higher for those not receiving radiationtherapy (hazard ratio = 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.54-1.79). Othersignificant adjusted predictors (P < .05) of poor overall survival were, advancedage, comprehensive community cancer program, facility location, poorlydifferentiated tumor, and high comorbidity index.CONCLUSION: Patients who received radiation therapy had better survival outcomes than those who did not, revealing discordance between results of randomizedtrials and real-world setting.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
