Heide.Ford@ucdenver.edu.Tumor-initiating cells (TIC) represent a subset of tumor cells with increasedself-renewal capability. TICs display resistance to frontline cancer treatmentand retain the ability to repopulate a tumor after therapy, leading to cancerrelapse. NOTCH signaling has been identified as an important driver of the TICpopulation, yet mechanisms governing regulation of this pathway in cancer remain to be fully elucidated. Here we identify a novel mechanism of NOTCH regulationand TIC induction in breast cancer via the miR-106b-25 miRNA cluster. We showthat the miR-106b-25 cluster upregulates NOTCH1 in multiple breast cancer celllines, representing both estrogen receptor (ER+) and triple negative breastcancer (TNBC) through direct repression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4L. Wefurther show that upregulation of NOTCH1 is necessary for TIC inductiondownstream of miR-106b-25 in both ER + and TNBC breast cancer cells, and thatre-expression of NEDD4L is sufficient to reverse miR106b-25-mediated NOTCH1upregulation and TIC induction. Importantly, we demonstrate a significantpositive correlation between miR-106b-25 and NOTCH1 protein, yet a significantinverse correlation between miR-106b-25 and NEDD4L mRNA in human breast cancer,suggesting a critical role for the miR106b-25/NEDD4L/NOTCH1 axis in the disease. Further, we show for the first time that NEDD4L expression alone is significantlyassociated with a better relapse-free prognosis for breast cancer patients. Thesedata expand our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying NOTCH activation and TICinduction in breast cancer, and may provide new avenues for the development oftherapies targeting this resistant subset of tumor cells.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0239-7 PMCID: PMC6043359 [Available on 2018-10-17]PMID: 29662198
