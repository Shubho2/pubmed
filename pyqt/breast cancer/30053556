Electronic address:yamamoto@mb.kyoto-phu.ac.jp.Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporter is an efflux transporter thatutilizes energy from ATP hydrolysis to push its substrates, regardless of theconcentration gradient. Its presence on the apical membrane of the intestinalmucosa is a major obstacle for the intestinal absorption of its substrates. Inthis study, we examined the effects of various pharmaceutical excipients on theintestinal transport and absorption of sulfasalazine, a BCRP substrate. Fourexcipients, including 0.05% and 0.075% BL-9EX, 0.01% and 0.05% Brij 97, 0.075%Labrasol, and 0.05 % and 0.1 % Tween 20 decreased the secretory transport ofsulfasalazine in an in vitro diffusion chamber. Further investigation in an insitu closed loop experiment in rats showed that 0.05 % and 0.1 % BL-9EX and 0.1 %Brij 97 effectively enhanced the intestinal absorption of sulfasalazine whilemaintaining minimal toxicity to the intestinal mucosa. However, 0.1% Brij 97 alsoincreased the intestinal absorption of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, a paracellularmarker compound. These findings suggest that BL-9EX might effectively inhibit theBCRP-mediated efflux of sulfasalazine in vivo, indicating that BL-9EX couldimprove the intestinal absorption of sulfasalazine and other BCRP substrates.Copyright Â© 2018.
