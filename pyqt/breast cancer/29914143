Oneapproach to overcome this problem involves attempts at developing drugs based on general cytotoxins, like calicheamicin and thapsigargin, which kill cells at all phases of the cell cycle. However, such toxins can only be used when efficienttargeting to the malignant tissue is possible. In the case of thapsigargin,selectivity for tumor-associated cells is achieved by conjugating the drug to apeptide that is only cleaved in the vicinity of tumors to release the cytotoxicdrug or an analog with retained activity. Solid-phase synthesis protocols weredeveloped for preparation of three already validated prodrugs of thapsigargin:one prodrug cleavable by human kallikrein 2, one prodrug cleavable byprostate-specific antigen, and one prodrug cleavable by prostate-specificmembrane antigen.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23061463 PMID: 29914143
