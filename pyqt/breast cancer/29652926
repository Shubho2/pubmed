However, since previous studies mostly focused onspecific AEs, treatments, or cancer types, limited information is currentlyavailable. Therefore, this study assessed the incremental healthcare costsassociated with a large number of AEs among patients diagnosed with some of themost prevalent types of cancer. Data were obtained from a large US claimsdatabase. Adult patients were included if diagnosed with and treated for one ofthe following cancer types: breast, digestive organs and peritoneum,genitourinary organs (including bladder and ovary and other uterine adnexa),lung, lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue, and skin. Treatment episodes weredefined as the period from initiation of the first antineoplastic pharmacologictherapy to discontinuation (i.e., gap of ≥ 45 days), or change in treatmentregimen, or end of data availability. A total of 36 AEs were selected from theproduct inserts of 104 treatments recommended by practice guidelines. Aretrospective matched cohort design was used, matching a treatment episode with acertain AE with a treatment episode without that AE. A total of 412,005 patients were selected, for a total of 794,243 treatment episodes, resulting in 1,617,368 matched treatment episodes across all 36 AEs. Incremental healthcare costsassociated with AEs of any severity ranged from $546 for cough/upper respiratory infections to $24,633 for gastrointestinal perforation. The three most costly AEswhen considering any severity were gastrointestinal perforation ($24,633),central nervous system hemorrhage ($24,322), and sepsis/septicemia ($23,510).Incremental healthcare costs associated with severe AEs ranged from $15,709 fordermatitis and rash to $48,538 for gastrointestinal fistula. The three mostcostly severe AEs were gastrointestinal fistula ($48,538), gastrointestinalperforation ($41,281), and central nervous system hemorrhage ($38,428). Inconclusion, AEs during treatment episodes for cancer were frequent and associatedwith a substantial economic burden.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196007 PMCID: PMC5898735PMID: 29652926  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
