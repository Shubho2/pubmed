The regulation and function of RAI2 in human colorectal cancer(CRC) remain unclear.Methods: Eight CRC cell lines and 237 cases of primary CRC were analyzed.Methylation-specific PCR (MSP), flow cytometry, xenograft mouse model, and shRNA technique were employed.Results: RAI2 was completely methylated in RKO, LOVO, and HCT116 cells; partiallymethylated in HT29 cells; and unmethylated in SW480, SW620, DLD1, and DKO cells. RAI2 was methylated in 53.6% (127/237) of primary colorectal cancer. Methylation of RAI2 was significantly associated with gender (P < 0.001), TNM stage(P < 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001). Analyzing by the Kaplan-Meiermethod, methylation of RAI2 was significantly associated with poor 5-year overallsurvival (OS) (P = 0.0035) and 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.0062).According to Cox proportional hazards model analysis, RAI2 methylation was anindependent poor prognostic marker for 5-year OS (P = 0.002) and poor 5-year RFS (P = 0.022). RAI2 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion andinduced cell apoptosis in CRC. In addition, RAI2 inhibited AKT signaling in CRCcells and suppressed human CRC cell xenograft growth in mice.Conclusion: RAI2 is frequently methylated in human CRC, and the expression ofRAI2 is regulated by promoter region methylation. Methylation of RAI2 is anindependent poor prognostic marker of CRC. RAI2 suppresses CRC cell growth bothin vitro and in vivo. RAI2 suppresses CRC by inhibiting AKT signaling.DOI: 10.1186/s13148-018-0501-4 PMCID: PMC5966878PMID: 29796120
