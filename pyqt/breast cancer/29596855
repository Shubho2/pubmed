Epub2018 Mar 26.Simple method for assembly of CRISPR synergistic activation mediator gRNAexpression array.Vad-Nielsen J(1), Nielsen AL(1), Luo Y(2).Author information: (1)Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.(2)Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.Electronic address: Alun@biomed.au.dk.When studying complex interconnected regulatory networks, effective methods forsimultaneously manipulating multiple genes expression are paramount. Previously, we have developed a simple method for generation of an all-in-one CRISPR gRNAexpression array. We here present a Golden Gate Assembly-based system ofsynergistic activation mediator (SAM) compatible CRISPR/dCas9 gRNA expressionarray for the simultaneous activation of multiple genes. Using this system, wedemonstrated the simultaneous activation of the transcription factors, TWIST,SNAIL, SLUG, and ZEB1 a human breast cancer cell line.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
