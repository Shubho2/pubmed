The aim of this study is to compare the effect of β-sitosterol(Mebo) ointment to trolamine (Biafine) cream for the prevention and treatment of radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiationtherapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective open-label randomized phase IIIstudy developed to assess the efficacy of 2 topical agents used for management ofacute radiation dermatitis. Female breast cancer patients who needed a course of radiation therapy in our institution were enrolled and randomized into 2 groups 1with Mebo ointment and 1 with Biafine cream. Both medications were applied twice per day during the whole period of treatment and skin reactions and relatedsymptoms were assessed weekly during the entire course. Grading of skin reactionswas done according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system.RESULTS: Between September 2015 and May 2017, a total of 161 patients wererecruited for this trial. Mean age was similar for both groups (50.19±12.57 vs.51.73±11.23, respectively, P=0.41). All other patients and treatmentcharacteristics were similar in both groups, except for the use of boost (82.7%in the Biafine group vs. 36.7% in Mebo group, P=0.012). Analysis was done forreactions recorded before the beginning of the boost and for the entire courseincluding the boost. Using univariate and multivariate analysis, there was nosignificant difference in grades 2 and 3 dermatitis between the 2 groups.However, the incidence of severe pruritus and severe local skin pain were bothsignificantly reduced in the Mebo group (14.1% in Biafine vs. 2.9% in Mebo,P=0.016 for pruritus and 11.5% vs. 1.4%, respectively, P=0.02 for severe pain).CONCLUSIONS: This study showed no difference between Mebo and Biafine in theincidence and severity of breast skin dermatitis during radiation therapy.However, the use of Mebo ointment was associated with decreased severe pruritusand pain which could positively affect patient comfort and quality of life.DOI: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000460 PMID: 29889137
