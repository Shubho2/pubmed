Electronic address: jinno@meijo-u.ac.jp.Estrogen is reported to be involved in mammary tumorigenesis. To unveil metabolicsignatures for estrogen-induced mammary tumorigenesis, we carried out serummetabolomic analysis in an estrogen-induced mammary tumor model, female AugustCopenhagen-Irish/Segaloff (ACI/Seg) rats, using liquid chromatography-massspectrometry. In contrast to the control group, all rats with an implanted17β-estradiol (E2) pellet developed mammary tumors during this experiment. E2treatment significantly suppressed body weight gain. But no significantdifferences in food consumption were observed between the two groups, suggesting that metabolic alteration depended on E2 treatment. Serum metabolomic analysisdetected 116 features that were statistically different (p < 0.01) between thegroups. Quantitation analysis revealed that several phospholipids such asphosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were identified assignificantly different metabolites. E2-treated rat serum stimulated theproliferation of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, theproliferation effect was diminished by pretreating cells with either autotaxininhibitor or antagonist for lysophosphatidic acid receptor whose ligands aremetabolites of LPCs via autotaxin-mediated hydrolysis. In summary, our resultssuggest that not only are phospholipids potential biomarkers for mammary tumorsbut importantly, LPCs themselves could be associated with E2-induced mammarytumorigenesis in female ACI/Seg rats.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
