However, the expression profiles and function of circRNAs in breastcancer metastasis are largely unknown. Here, we determined that the expression ofa novel circRNA, which we named circIRAK3, was increased in metastatic breastcancer (BC) cells and predictive of BC recurrence. Gain-of-function andloss-of-function studies in BC cells demonstrated that circIRAK3 promoted cellmigration, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo but did not affect cellproliferation, colony formation or cell cycle progression. Using circIRAK3 invivo precipitation and luciferase reporter assays, we identified miR-3607 as acircIRAK3-associated miRNA. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and bioinformaticsanalysis showed that forkhead box C1 (FOXC1), the target of miR-3607, wasdownregulated in circIRAK3-silenced cells and mediated circIRAK3-induced BC cell migration. Intriguingly, FOXC1 could, in turn, bind to the IRAK3 promoter,triggering a positive-feedback loop that perpetuated the circIRAK3/miR-3607/FOXC1signaling axis. Collectively, our findings indicated that circIRAK3 may exertregulatory roles in BC metastasis and may be a potential target for metastatic BCtherapy.Copyright Â© 2018.
