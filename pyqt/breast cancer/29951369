However, duringthe last years there has been growing evidence for prolonged and chronicinfection occurring in patients with immunosuppression. Also patients withmalignant and rheumatic diseases have been identified to be at risk for chronichepatitis E. However, their course and prognosis are not well characterized andthere have been no reports of hepatitis E virus infection in patients withgynecological cancer. Here, we report three Caucasian females with breast andovarian cancers presenting with elevation of aminotransferase levels duringanticancer treatment. Although only few or no clinical hints suggested hepatitis E virus infection, the diagnosis of hepatitis E virus infection was confirmed by seroconversion, which might occur with some delay, and/or by polymerase chainreaction. While two patients had a self-limited course, the third patient with a high-risk oncological constellation required ribavirin in order to resumechemotherapy. These cases highlight the need for hepatitis E virus testing inpatients with gynecological cancer and elevated aminotransferase levels. Further,these cases show that in selected high-risk patients, ribavirin treatment may be necessary based on the decision of a multidisciplinary team.DOI: 10.14218/JCTH.2017.00063 PMCID: PMC6018315PMID: 29951369
