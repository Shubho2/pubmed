Based on a cutoff of 20 ng/mL, patients werecategorized into "either sufficient" or "both deficient" groups. The associationswith clinicopathological data, including pCR and survival, were analyzed usingmultivariable analyses.Results: Patients with either pre- or post-NCT sufficient 25(OH)D levelsaccounted for 23.8%, and the overall pCR rate was 25.9%. Most patients showed25(OH)D deficiency at diagnosis and 65.8% showed decreased serum levels afterNCT. Changes in 25(OH)D status were associated with postmenopause status, ruralresidence, baseline summer examination, and molecular phenotype, but not pCR. No association between survival and 25(OH)D status was found, including in thesubgroup analyses based on molecular phenotypes.Conclusion: Most Korean patients with breast cancer showed vitamin D deficiencyat diagnosis and a significant decrease in the serum concentration after NCT. No association with oncologic outcomes was found. Therefore, although optimalmanagement for vitamin D deficiency is urgent for skeletal health, furtherresearch is warranted to clearly determine the prognostic role of vitamin D inpatients with breast cancer who are candidates for NCT.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.134 PMCID: PMC6015976PMID: 29963108
