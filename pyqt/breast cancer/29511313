Accounting for 15% of breast cancers, BLBC often exhibits apoor prognosis and tends to metastasize to the brain and lungs. Because most BLBCdisplay a triple-negative phenotype (ER-, PR-, and HER2-), conventional cytotoxicchemotherapy remains the only treatment option despite poor success and high rateof relapse. The overexpression of the forkhead-box transcription factor C1(FOXC1) was recently identified as a biomarker of BLBC. Increased expression ofFOXC1 was linked to excessive mobility and growth of BLBC cell lines, suggesting FOXC1 as a therapeutic target. In this study, siRNA-mediated knockdown of FOXC1was confirmed to decrease the proliferation rate, migration, and invasion in amodel BLBC-like cell line (4T1). 4T1 and 4T1-∆FOXC1 cells lacking FOXC1expression (generated by CRISPR/Cas9) were used to evaluate the effects of FOXC1 expression in an orthotopic murine model of BLBC. No statistically significantdifference in tumor volume was observed between 4T1 and 4T1-∆FOXC1 tumors.Furthermore, tumors metastasized to the liver and lungs to a similar degreeregardless of FOXC1 expression. These data suggest that, despite positive resultsin vitro, FOXC1 may not be a promising therapeutic target for BLBC.DOI: 10.1038/s41417-018-0010-9 PMID: 29511313
