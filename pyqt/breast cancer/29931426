In this study, we evaluated theprognostic value of this new staging system compared to the previous AJCC 7thedition staging system.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of women with stage I, II, or III BC who underwent curative surgery with/without adjuvant systemic therapy atSamsung Medical Center between July 2004 and December 2008.RESULTS: Of 3,208 BCs, this study was analyzed using the information of 2,790 BC patients. Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor 2(HER2)- BCs were observed in 62.9% of BCs, HR+/ HER2+ in 9.3%, HR-/HER2- in17.0%, and HR-/HER2+ in 10.8%. In survival analysis, we observed 245 distantrecurrences and 198 deaths caused by BC progression. The median follow-upduration was 116.2 months. 10-year disease-specific survival (DSS) ratesaccording to the AJCC 7th edition criteria were 97.2% of stage IA, 100% of IB,94.9% of IIA, 87.9% of IIB, 86.4% of IIIA, 95.7% of IIIB, and 65.7% of IIIC(p < 0.001). After applying 8th edition criteria, the 10-year DSS rates were98.1% of stage IA, 97.7% of IB, 93.8% of IIA, 92.7% of IIB, 88.2% of IIIA, 80.8% of IIIB, and 70.3% of IIIC (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The AJCC 8th edition clinical staging system provides a goodprognostic value and addresses the weakness of the AJCC 7th edition, which usesonly anatomical pathologic staging.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4858-z PMID: 29931426
