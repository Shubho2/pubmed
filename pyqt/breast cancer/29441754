This retrospective study exploredthe efficacy and complications of extraspinal POPs.METHODS: The origin of the cancer metastasis, performed POP sites, necessity ofadjacent joint injections, pain and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores,complications related to the POPs, and life expectancy were evaluated from themedical records from 2009 to 2016.RESULTS: A total of 47 (M/F = 28/19) patients had received 54 POPs, includingcostoplasty, scapuloplasty, ilioplasty, humeroplasty, ischioplasty, femoroplasty,sternoplasty, and puboplasty, in order of frequency. The most common sites forthe origin of the cancer, in order of frequency, were the lung, liver, breast,colon, and kidney. All patients receiving POPs including scapuloplasty,ilioplasty, humeroplasty, and femoroplasty needed adjacent joint injectionsbefore or after the POPs. Pain due to metastatic lesions was reducedsignificantly immediately after the POPs and the reduction was sustained untilthe end of their lives. The median KPS was increased from 35.4% to 67.7%immediately after the POPs. There were no complications related to theprocedures. The mean life expectancy after performing the POPs, for 35 patientswhich died afterwards, was 99.3 days, ranging from 1 to 767 days.CONCLUSION: Even though pain in the isolated POP sites may be difficult tomeasure due to overlapping systemic pain, the POPs provided immediate local pain relief, and the patients showed better physical performance withoutprocedure-related complications.Â© 2018 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.DOI: 10.3346/jkms.2018.33.e61 PMCID: PMC5809751PMID: 29441754  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
