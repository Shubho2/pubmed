However, even among the same tumorhistotype, interpatient tumor heterogeneity should be considered for besttherapeutic result. Metabolomics represents the last addition to promising "omic"sciences such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Biochemicaltransformation processes underlying energy production and biosynthetic processes have been recognized as a hallmark of the cancer cell and hold a promise to builda bridge between genotype and phenotype. Since breast tumors represent acollection of different diseases, understanding metabolic differences betweenmolecular subtypes offers a way to identify new subtype-specific treatmentstrategies, especially if metabolite changes are evaluated in the broader contextof the network of enzymatic reactions and pathways. Here, after a brief overview of the literature, original metabolomics data in a series of 92 primary breastcancer patients undergoing surgery at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milanoare reported highlighting a series of metabolic differences across variousmolecular subtypes. In particular, the difficult-to-treat luminal B subgrouprepresents a tumor type which preferentially relies on fatty acids for energy,whereas HER2 and basal-like ones show prevalently alterations inglucose/glutamine metabolism.DOI: 10.1155/2017/7687851 PMCID: PMC5757146PMID: 29434411
