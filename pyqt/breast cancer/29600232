A hospital-based, 5-year (2010-2014) retrospective study was conducted at a regional cancer center of Odisha to analyze the present burden of cancer cervixin this state, which has a population of more than 45.5 million at present.Materials and Methods: All the patients suffering from cancer cervix that wastreated by radiotherapy during 2010-2014 at this center were analyzed year wisefor age, stage of disease, and native area.Results: Based on the Census 2011 data, it was calculated and found that from thelow-literacy area on an average of 4.62 cervical cancer patients per million,from the medium-literacy area 6.56 patients per million, and from high-literacyarea 19.11 patients per million of population have received radiotherapy in this hospital. More than 60% of patients with cervical cancer were from stage IIIB andin the age group of 50-55 years.Discussion: Odisha has 83.7% female population in rural areas with literacy rate below 50%. Due to lack of awareness and unavailability of cancer care facilities at their reach, they mainly depend on various alternative medicines inunscientific manner for their health care.Conclusion: Strengthening of existing regional cancer center, development ofoncology wings in all medical college hospitals by providing basic radiotherapyfacilities, emphasizing more on district cancer control programs, decentralizing of NGO schemes, and facilitating with more cancer screening and awarenessprograms may help better registration, prevention, and treatment of cancer inOdisha.DOI: 10.4103/sajc.sajc_174_17 PMCID: PMC5865093PMID: 29600232
