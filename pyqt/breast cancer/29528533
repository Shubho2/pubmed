This study explored the body image, self-perceived attractiveness, and sexual/romantic experiences of Danes diagnosed with cancer atthe age of 15 to 29 years. It also aimed to clarify whether self-perceived needs for counseling were in fact met by health care providers.METHODS: All Danes who had been diagnosed with cancer at the age of 15 to29 years during the period 2009 to 2013 were included in a cross-sectionalnationwide questionnaire study. Eight hundred twenty-two questionnaires werereturned, yielding a response rate of 45%.RESULTS: More than half of the respondents (53.8%) reported that cancer hadaltered their body image negatively, while 44.6% felt that disease had loweredtheir feeling of being attractive. Nearly one-third (31.3%) and one-fourth(23.6%), respectively, had experienced a negative impact on their desire to have sex or to flirt/date/have a partner. Female responders were more affected thanmales on most variables, and breast cancer patients were approximately 4 timesmore at risk for sexual and romantic adversities than patients with melanoma ofthe skin. Although more than 80% indicated a need to discuss issues of sexuality and intimacy with a health professional, 49.5% and 61.7%, respectively, hadtalked little or not at all with professionals during hospitalization andfollow-up consultations.CONCLUSIONS: Young cancer patients experience sexual and romantic challengesalong with a lack of self-perceived attractiveness. Their substantial need fordialogue and counselling should be met in health care settings.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4700 PMID: 29528533
