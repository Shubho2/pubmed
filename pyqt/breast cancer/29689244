Electronicaddress: leihuo@mdanderson.org.Advanced-stage breast cancer patients comprise a smaller proportion of breastcancer patients than do early stage patients and are more likely to experience a poor outcome. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms and identifyingnew biomarkers for treatment in this subgroup of patients is paramount. With the aim of identifying microRNAs that are regulated in advanced-stage breast cancer, we found lower expression of miR-26b, a member of the miR-26 family, ininflammatory breast cancer and noninflammatory locally advanced breast cancertissue than in normal breast tissue, by quantitative real-time polymerase chainreaction and in situ hybridization. Quantitative real-time polymerase chainreaction (but not in situ hybridization) also revealed lower miR-26b expressionin inflammatory breast cancer than in noninflammatory locally advanced breastcancer. Furthermore, lower expression of miR-26b was correlated with shorterdistant metastasis-free survival and overall survival in univariate analysis, andwith shorter overall survival in multivariate analysis. The expression ofmiRNA-26b was inversely associated with EZH2 protein expression in several breastcancer cell lines, and overexpression and knockdown of miR-26b causedcorresponding changes in EZH2 expression. Our study shows that miR-26b mayregulate EZH2 expression in breast cancer and may be useful as a therapeutictarget for inflammatory breast cancer and noninflammatory locally advanced breastcancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
