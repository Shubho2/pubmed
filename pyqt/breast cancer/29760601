In this study, we investigated the relation betweentelomere instability and radiation-induced accelerated senescence. Partialknockdown of DNA-dependent catalytic subunit of protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) inhuman breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was established by small interfering RNA.Radiosensitivity of control and DNA-PKcs knockdown MCF-7 cells was analyzed byclonogenetic assay. Cell growth was measured by real-time cell electronicsensing. Senescence and apoptosis were evaluated by β-galactosidase histochemicalstaining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, respectively. DNA damage wasdetermined by long polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Telomere length and integritywere analyzed by real-time PCR and cytogenetic assay, respectively. DNA-PKcsknockdown MCF-7 cells were more sensitive to X-irradiation than control cells.Further investigation revealed that accelerated senescence is more pronouncedthan apoptosis in cells after radiation, particularly in DNA-PKcs knockdowncells. The cytogenetic assay and kinetics of DNA damage repair revealed that the role of telomere end-capping in DNA-PKcs, rather than DNA damage repair, was morerelevant to radiosensitivity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to showthat DNA-PKcs plays an important role in radiation-induced accelerated senescencevia maintenance of telomere integrity in MCF-7 cells. These results could beuseful for future understanding of the radiation-induced genome instability andits consequences.DOI: 10.1177/1559325818771527 PMCID: PMC5944147PMID: 29760601
