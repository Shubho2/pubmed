In our study, we sought to assess the underlying molecular mechanisms ofcircRNAs in breast cancer and therefore explored the differentially expressedcircRNAs and co-expression networks, followed by in vitro experiments.Materials and methods: High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed to obtain an unbiased profile of circRNA expression. CircRNA-miRNA-mRNA co-expression networkswere predicted, and sequence analyses were carried out. The MTT, transwellmigration and invasion assay was conducted in Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 cells that had been transfected with si-circRNA and si-negative control (si-NC).Results: A total of 152 circRNAs were differentially expressed in breast cancertissues, among which 85 were upregulated and 67 downregulated. Out of these,hsa_circ_0011946 was selected and the subsequent bioinformatics analysispredicted that hsa_circ_0011946 sponging miR-26a/b directly targeted replication factor C subunit 3 (RFC3) and that its knockdown could inhibit RFC3 mRNA andprotein expression. Furthermore, hsa_circ_0011946 loss-of-function significantly suppressed the migration and invasion of Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 cells.Conclusion: Together, these results indicate that hsa_circ_0011946 and RFC3comprise a novel pathway involved in the progression of breast cancer.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S155923 PMCID: PMC5865555PMID: 29593432
