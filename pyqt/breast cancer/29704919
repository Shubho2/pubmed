Electronic address: Ian.Campbell@waikatodhb.health.nz.The aim of this study was to understand the characteristics of older women withbreast cancer and to describe the current patterns of treatment and outcomes. Thestudy included data from the combined Auckland and Waikato breast cancerregisters, which hold information for 12, 372 women diagnosed with stage I-IVbreast cancer between June 2000 and May 2013. Of these women, 2671 (21.6%) wereover 70 years of age. Patient characteristics, treatment type and survival werecompared across four-year age groups (70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85+) and hormonereceptor status. Of the women aged over 70 years, 2485 (93.0%) had stage I-IIIdisease. Increasing age was significantly associated with decreasing use ofsurgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, even afteradjustment for stage and level of co-morbidity. Nine hundred and one women(33.7%) had co-morbidities at the time of diagnosis. The 5-year breastcancer-specific survival rate for women aged 70-74 and that for women aged 75-79 were similar, but was worse in women aged over 80. Generally, older women aretreated as per guidelines, although chemotherapy may be under-used. However, age is a significant factor influencing whether women are treated or not.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.maturitas.2018.03.018 PMID: 29704919
