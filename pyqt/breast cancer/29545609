In order to implement highlysensitive diagnostic tools we demonstrate the use of nanoprobes engineered fromnanobodies (single-domain antibodies, sdAbs) and fluorescent quantum dots (QDs)for single- and two-photon detection and imaging of human micrometastases anddisseminated tumour cells in ex vivo biological samples of breast and pancreatic metastatic tumour mouse models expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). By staining thin (5-10 µm) paraffinand thick (50 µm) agarose tissue sections, we detected HER2- and CEA-positivehuman tumour cells infiltrating the surrounding tissues or metastasizing todifferent organs, including the brain, testis, lung, liver, and lymph nodes.Compared to conventional fluorescently labelled antibodies the sdAb-HER2-QD andsdAb-CEA-QD nanoprobes are superior in detecting micrometastases in tissuesections by lower photobleaching and higher brightness of fluorescence signalsensuring much better discrimination of positive signals versus background. Veryhigh two-photon absorption cross-sections of QDs and small size of the nanoprobesensure efficient imaging of thick tissue sections unattainable with conventional fluorescent probes. The nanobody-QD probes will help to improve early cancerdiagnosis and prognosis of progression by assessing metastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22973-8 PMCID: PMC5854706PMID: 29545609
