[Epub ahead of print]Identification of Myofascial Trigger Points in Breast Cancer Survivors with UpperLimb Pain: Interrater Reliability.De Groef A(1)(2), Van Kampen M(1)(2), Dieltjens E(1)(2), De Geyter S(1)(2), VosL(1)(2), De Vrieze T(1)(2), Geraerts I(1)(2), Devoogdt N(1)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven-University of Leuven, Leuven,Belgium.(2)Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University HospitalsLeuven, Leuven, Belgium.Objective: Despite the increasing awareness of the contribution of myofascialdysfunctions to upper limb pain in breast cancer survivors, reliability of theidentification of myofascial trigger points (MTPs) in this population has not yetbeen investigated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate theinterrater reliability of the identification of MTPs by palpation at the upperlimb region in breast cancer survivors with upper limb pain.Design: Interrater reliability study.Setting: University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium.Subjects: Thirty breast cancer survivors with pain at the upper limb region.Methods: Nine muscles (upper trapezius, levator scapulae, infraspinatus,supraspinatus, teres major and minor, subscapularis, pectoralis major, andscalene muscles) at the operated side were examined. The weighted kappa (WK)coefficient and Absolute Agreement with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.Results: Moderate agreement was found for all examined upper limb muscles(WK = 0.41-0.60), except for the trapezius muscle, for which the agreement wasalmost perfect (WK = 0.83), and the supraspinatus muscle (WK = 0.23), for whichthe agreement was only fair.Conclusions: For most muscles, moderate interrater reliability for theidentification of MTPs by palpation in breast cancer survivors with upper limbpain was found. Therefore, we concluded that the identification of MTPs bypalpation may add to the diagnosis of the myofascial pain syndrome in breastcancer survivors.DOI: 10.1093/pm/pnx299 PMID: 29618110
