Because of time constraints and otherpatient health priorities, health care providers often do not discuss benefitsand risks associated with cancer screening. We analyzed the association betweenseeking information online about breast and prostate cancer and undergoingmammography and PSA screening.METHODS: We assessed guideline concordance in mammogram and PSA screening,according to USPSTF guidelines for those at average risk for disease. We useddata on 4,537 survey respondents from the National Cancer Institute's HealthInformation National Trends Survey (HINTS) for 2012 through 2014 to assess onlineinformation-seeking, defined as whether people searched for cancer-relatedinformation online in the past 12 months. We used HINTS data to constructmultivariable logistic regression models to isolate the effect of exposure toonline information on the incidence of cancer screening.RESULTS: After controlling for available covariates, we found no significantassociation between online information-seeking and guideline-concordant screeningfor breast or prostate cancer. Significant covariate values suggest that factors related to access to care were significantly associated with conformance tomammography guidelines for women recommended for screening and that physiciandiscussion was significantly associated with nonconformance to guidelines forprostate-specific antigen screening (ie, having a PSA test in spite of therecommendation not to have it). Decomposition of differences between those whosought online information and those who did not indicated that uncontrolledconfounders probably had little effect on findings.CONCLUSION: We found little evidence that online information-seekingsignificantly affected screening for breast or prostate cancer in accordance withUSPSTF guidelines among people at average risk.DOI: 10.5888/pcd15.170147 PMCID: PMC5912925PMID: 29679480
