A medicalpossession ratio of < 80% was used to define non-adherence. Logistic regressionwas used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) ofnon-adherence.RESULTS: During follow-up, 977 (21%) women became non-adherents. Non-adherencewas associated with greater comorbidity burden assessed by Charlson comorbidityindex (CCI) during follow-up (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.08-1.88 for ≥ 2 additional scorescompared to 0), pre-diagnostic HRT use (OR 1.99; 1.58-2.49), not married (OR1.42; 1.23-1.64), high educational level (OR 1.25; 1.02-1.53 compared to lowestlevel), and use of symptom-relieving drugs. HER-2 positivity (OR 0.61; 0.45-0.81)and adjuvant chemotherapy (OR 0.42; 0.35-0.52) were associated with lower odds ofnon-adherence. Similar patterns were observed for the presence of lymph nodemetastasis, higher tumour grade, and use of AIs compared to tamoxifen. Myocardialinfarction and chronic pulmonary disease was suggested as leading conditionsassociated with non-adherence in women with increasing CCI.CONCLUSION: We identified subgroups of women with breast cancer at increased riskof non-adherence. Our findings related to comorbidity suggest the importance offocusing on the presence of specific co-existing conditions when monitoringadherence.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4890-z PMID: 30030708
