This study investigated how skin structureand lipid metabolism, factors strongly associated with barrier function, differedamong 50 Japanese women of greatly varying body mass index (BMI). Subjectsreceiving breast reconstruction surgery were chosen for analysis to obtain skinsamples from the same site. The subjects were classified into two groups, control(BMI < 25 kg/m2) and obese (25 kg/m2 ≤ BMI < 35 kg/m2), according to standards inJapan. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to assess skin thickness, Ki-67immunostaining to examine keratinocyte proliferation, and real-time polymerasechain reaction to measure skin expression levels of genes associated with lipidmetabolism. Total lipids, cholesterol, and fatty acids were also measured fromthese same skin samples. In the obese group, structural changes includedepidermal thickening and an increase in the number of Ki-67-positive(proliferating) cells. Both skin cholesterol and fatty acid levels exhibited an"inverted-U" relationship with BMI, suggesting that there is an optimal BMI forpeak lipid content and barrier function. Decreased lipid levels at higher BMIwere accompanied by downregulated expression of PPARδ and other genes related to lipid metabolism, including those encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase and HMG-CoAreductase, the rate-limiting enzymes for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis,respectively. Thus, elevated BMI may lead to deficient skin barrier function bysuppressing local lipid synthesis.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193830 PMCID: PMC5843255PMID: 29518109  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
