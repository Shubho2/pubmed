Electronic address: a.dove@bham.ac.uk.Controlled, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems are of growing interestfor both tissue regeneration and disease, including cancer, enabling hypothesistesting about the effects of microenvironment cues on a variety of cellularprocesses, including aspects of disease progression. In this work, we encapsulateand culture in three dimensions different cancer cell lines in a syntheticextracellular matrix (ECM), using mild and efficient chemistry. Specifically,harnessing the nucleophilic addition of thiols to activated alkynes, we havecreated hydrogel-based materials with multifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)and select biomimetic peptides. These materials have definable, controlledmechanical properties (G' = 4-10 kPa) and enable facile incorporation of pendant peptides for cell adhesion, relevant for mimicking soft tissues, where polymerarchitecture allows tuning of matrix degradation. These matrices rapidly formedin the presence of sensitive breast cancer cells (MCF-7) for successfulencapsulation with high cell viability, greatly improved relative to thatobserved with the more widely used radically-initiated thiol-ene crosslinkingchemistry. Furthermore, controlled matrix degradation by both bulk and localmechanisms, ester hydrolysis of the polymer network and cell-driven enzymatichydrolysis of cell-degradable peptide, allowed cell proliferation and theformation of cell clusters within these thiol-yne hydrogels. These studiesdemonstrate the importance of chemistry in ECM mimics and the potential thiol-ynechemistry has as a crosslinking reaction for the encapsulation and culture ofcells, including those sensitive to radical crosslinking pathways.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
