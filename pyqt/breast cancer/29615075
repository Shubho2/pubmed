Studies havepredominantly focused on the effects of oxygen or glucose scarcity in tumourcells, while attributing insufficient emphasis to the inadequate supply of ironin hypoxic regions. Cellular responses to iron deficiency and hypoxia areinterlinked and may strongly affect tumour metabolism.METHODS: We examined the morphological, proteomic, and metabolic effects induced by two iron chelators-deferoxamine (DFO) and di-2-pyridylketone4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT)-on MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 breastcancer cells.RESULTS: These chelators induced a cytoplasmic massive vacuolation andaccumulation of lipid droplets (LDs), eventually followed by implosive,non-autophagic, and non-apoptotic death similar to methuosis. Vacuoles and LDsare generated by expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) based onextracellular fluid import, which includes unsaturated fatty acids thataccumulate in LDs. Typical physiological phenomena associated with hypoxia areobserved, such as inhibition of translation, mitochondrial dysfunction, andmetabolic remodelling. These survival-oriented changes are associated with agreater expression of epithelial/mesenchymal transcription markers.CONCLUSIONS: Iron starvation induces a hypoxia-like program able to scavengenutrients from the extracellular environment, and cells assume a hypertrophicphenotype. Such survival strategy is accompanied by the ER-dependent massivecytoplasmic vacuolization, mitochondrial dysfunctions, and LD accumulation andthen evolves into cell death. LDs containing a greater proportion of unsaturated lipids are released as a consequence of cell death. The consequence of thedisruption of iron metabolism in tumour tissue and the effects of LDs onintercellular communication, cancer-inflammation axis, and immunity remain to be explored. Considering the potential benefits, these are crucial subjects forfuture mechanistic and clinical studies.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0737-z PMCID: PMC5883539PMID: 29615075
