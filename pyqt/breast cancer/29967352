We aimed to quantitatively assess the extent to which this waspresent in these tumors through subclonal genomic analyses and to determinewhether distinct tumor subpopulations may interact to promote tumorigenesis bygenerating subclonal patient-derived models in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of 142sequenced tumors revealed multiple tumor subclones, spatially and temporallycoexisting in a stable manner as observed by multiple sampling strategies. Weisolated genotypically and phenotypically distinct subpopulations that we proposecooperate to enhance tumorigenicity and resistance to therapy. Inactivatingmutations in the H4K20 histone methyltransferase KMT5B (SUV420H1), present in <1%of cells, abrogate DNA repair and confer increased invasion and migration onneighboring cells, in vitro and in vivo, through chemokine signaling andmodulation of integrins. These data indicate that even rare tumor subpopulations may exert profound effects on tumorigenesis as a whole and may represent a newavenue for therapeutic development. Unraveling the mechanisms of subclonaldiversity and communication in pGBM and DIPG will be an important step towardovercoming barriers to effective treatments.DOI: 10.1038/s41591-018-0086-7 PMID: 29967352
