Endocrine therapy (ET) is the basis of first-line (1L) therapy forpatients with HR+/HER2- MBC. Novel therapies have demonstrated improvements inprogression-free survival (PFS) compared to ET. The clinical relevance of PFS is being debated, as there is no proven direct correlation with overall survival(OS) benefit to date. We reviewed studies of HR+/HER2- MBC to assess PFS andother factors that influence OS and treatment response, and health-relatedquality of life (HRQoL).Methods: The Embase®, Medline®, and Cochrane databases were systematicallysearched to identify studies in adult women with HR+/HER2- MBC, published betweenJanuary 2006 and January 2017, and written in English. Phase II and IIIrandomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational, and retrospective studieswere included.Results: Seventy-nine RCTs were identified: 58 (73%) in the 1L+ setting and 21(27%) in second-line or greater settings. PFS hazard ratios (HRs) were reportedin 61 (77%) studies; 31 (39%) reported significant PFS improvements. OS wasreported in 44 (41%) studies; 12 (15%) reported significant OS improvements.Significant improvements in both PFS and OS were reported in only 6 (8%) studies (1 Phase II; 5 Phase III). Patients with HER2- MBC received, on average, ≥5 linesof therapy, with no consistent treatment pathway. Baseline characteristics, priortherapies, and the type and number of post-progression therapies significantlyimpacted OS. PFS, response rates, and HRQoL decreased with each line of therapy(EuroQol 5 Dimensions: 0.78 1L vs. 0.70 post-progression).Conclusion: Few RCTs in HR+/HER2- MBC have demonstrated significant improvements in OS. Factors other than choice of 1L therapy impact OS, includingpost-progression therapies, which cannot be controlled in RCTs. This studyemphasizes the importance of PFS improvement in 1L treatment of HR+/HER2- MBC.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S162714 PMCID: PMC5942396PMID: 29765249
