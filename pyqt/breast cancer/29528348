The DC vaccines, KLH-conjugated vaccines orglycosylated peptide vaccines can efficiently induce immune responses againsttumors. In the current study, we have discovered cholesteryl PADRE-EGFRvIIIepitope-conjugated lipopeptide self-assembled micelles as a potentialself-adjuvant vaccine against cutaneous melanoma. The lipopeptide vaccines weresynthesized using a standard solid phase peptide synthesis method, and thesevaccines could elicit both a humoral and a cellular immune response to EGFRvIIIpositive melanoma cells. Their high humoral immunoreaction stimulation propertiesin combination with their cytotoxic T-cell eliciting properties provide them withpotent tumor inhibitory capacity. In therapeutic and preventive xenograft models of B16-EGFRvIII melanoma cells, the self-adjuvant lipopeptide vaccine micellesefficiently prevented tumor growth as well as tumorigenesis. Our results provide a novel platform for eliciting immune responses to non-antigenic cancer-relatedepitopes in peptide cancer vaccine discovery and development.DOI: 10.1039/c8bm00017d PMID: 29528348
