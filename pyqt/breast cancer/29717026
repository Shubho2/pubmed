Vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) is essentialfor development of lymphatic vessels and lymphatic metastases duringcarcinogenesis. Steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) interacts with nuclearreceptors and transcription factors to promote tumor proliferation andmetastasis. However, the correlation between SRC-1 and VEGFC levels in thelymphatic metastases of thyroid cancer remains unclear. We analyzed 20-pairedspecimens of thyroid cancer tissue and normal thyroid tissue and found increased levels of SRC-1 and VEGFC proteins in 13/20 and 15/20 thyroid cancer specimens,respectively, when compared with those levels in specimens of normal thyroidtissue. A high level of SRC-1 expression was positively correlated with VEGFC andlymphatic endothelial cell marker LYVE-1 expression. Papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line TPC-1 displayed high levels of SRC-1 and VEGFC expression and wasselected for stable knockdown of SRC-1 in vitro Inhibition of SRC-1 significantlyreduced the VEGFC levels in TPC-1 cells. We found that SRC-1 binds totranscription factor NF-kB (p50/p65), and that this coactivation complex directlypromoted VEGFC transcription, which could be abrogated by SRC-1 knockdown.Up-regulated NF-kB signaling was also confirmed in thyroid cancer tissues. Invivo studies showed that SRC-1 knockdown restricted tumor growth, reduced thenumbers of LYVE-1-positive lymphatic vessels, and decreased the levels of VEGFCin tumor tissues. These results suggest a tumorigenic role for SRC-1 in thyroidcancer via its ability to regulate VEGFC expression.© 2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20180394 PMCID: PMC5997793PMID: 29717026
