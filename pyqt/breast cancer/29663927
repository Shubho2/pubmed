In the current study we evaluated thepotential use of Ajwa Dates Extract (ADE), reported to have anti-cancer effects, as an adjuvant therapy in combination with 5-flurouracil (5FU) against thehuman-breast-adenocarcinoma cell line (MFC-7) in vitro. The effects of ADE alone and in combination with 5-FU were evaluated in terms of cell viability andcytotoxicity. For drug delivery purpose, we successfully encapsulated 5FU in bothpresence and absence of ADE through electrospinning together with polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) in different combinations. Physicochemicalproperties of 5FU and ADE incorporated into PLGA nanofibers remained unaltered asconfirmed by Fourier-Transform-Infrared (FTIR), Raman-spectroscopies and X-rayDiffraction (XRD) techniques. The morphological characterization of nanofiberswas done using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy(AFM). The surface roughness of PLGA and PLGA + ADE nanofibers increased byincorporation of 5FU. PLGA + ADE nanofibers were in hydrophilic range (<90°)while nanofibers prepared from both PLGA + 5FU and PLGA + 5FU + ADE combinations were in hydrophobic range (∼112°). The percentage inhibition of MCF-7proliferation at 72 hrs showed an enhanced combinatorial anti-cancer effect of5FU and ADE on the cells seeded on PLGA + 5FU + ADE mat (47% decrease) while PLGA+ 5FU and PLGA + ADE demonstrated only 23% and 16% decrease respectively ascompared to controls. The hydrophobicity induced by 5FU can further beinvestigated to get improved cellular adherence and efficientcontrolled-drug-release.DOI: 10.1166/jbn.2018.2515 PMID: 29663927
