Observational clinical studies thatcompared the depression incidence in different surgery groups and presentedempirical findings were selected.RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria, including 5, 4, 2 and 5studies compared depression between total mastectomy (TM) and breast conservingtherapy (BCS), TM and breast reconstruction (BR), BCS and BR, or among all three groups (TM, BCS and BR), respectively. Only 1 of 5 studies, which subjected tomultivariate analysis of depression in female breast cancer, reported astatistically significant effect of type of surgery on depression occurrence. Ourmeta-analysis showed no significant differences among the three types of surgery,with BCS patients versus TM patients (relative risk [RR] = 0.89, 95% confidenceinterval [CI] 0.78-1.01; P = 0.06), BR patients versus TM patients (RR = 0.87,95% CI 0.71-1.06; P = 0.16) and BCS patients versus BR patients (RR = 1.10; 95%CI 0.89-1.35; P = 0.37), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that there were no statistically significantdifferences concerning the occurrence of depressive symptoms in breast cancerpatients as a consequence of TM, BCS or BR at mean time more than 1-year termpostoperatively.DOI: 10.1007/s00268-018-4477-1 PMID: 29426972
