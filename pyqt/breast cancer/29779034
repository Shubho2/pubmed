However, the exact effects andmolecular mechanisms of IQGAP1 in breast cancer progression remain poorlyunderstood. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the present study, IQGAP1 expression wasmeasured in 96 paired breast cancer samples and the corresponding adjacentnon-cancerous tissues by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chainreaction. To further explore the biological function of IQGAP1 in breast cancercells, we knocked down IQGAP1 expression in MCF-7 cells and overexpressed it inSK-BR-3 cells. RESULTS IQGAP1 was specifically upregulated in breast cancertissues compared with the corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Moreover,IQGAP1 expression was positively correlated with breast cancer survival rate.IQGAP1 also promoted breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and suppressed apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, our results suggest thatIQGAP1 plays an important role in the cell proliferation and invasion of humanbreast cancer cells, thus indicating that IQGAP1 may be a potential therapeutictarget for the treatment of human breast cancer.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.909916 PMCID: PMC5991136PMID: 29779034
