In the absence of validated tools, many studies use the presence of both the myalgia and arthralgia components of the Common Terminology Criteria forAdverse Events (CTCAE) to define TAPS. The present study prospectively evaluated the frequency, severity, and impact of TAPS in patients with breast or prostatecancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, non-randomized study, patients withbreast or prostate cancer commencing taxane-based chemotherapy completed theCTCAE (version 4.03), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Taxane(FACT-T), and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaires at baseline and oncebetween days 5 and 7 of each chemotherapy cycle.RESULTS: From March 2015 to April 1, 2016, 75 patients (breast n = 66, prostaten = 9) were enrolled; 83% received docetaxel and 16% paclitaxel and 1% withdrew. After the first cycle of taxane, TAPS was reported by 25/69 (36.2%) patients; afurther 8/69 (18.2%) reporting TAPS after a subsequent chemotherapy treatment.Overall incidence of TAPS was 33/75 (44%). While associated with detrimentalscores on FACT-T and BPI as well as increased use of analgesics in 63% (21/33) ofpatients with TAPS, TAPS did not lead to alterations in chemotherapy dosing.CONCLUSIONS: TAPS is common after taxane-based chemotherapy, and its presence is associated with reduced quality of life and increased analgesic requirements.Prospective patient-reported outcome assessments are crucial to helpindividualize treatment strategies and improve management of TAPS.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4161-x PMID: 29564623
