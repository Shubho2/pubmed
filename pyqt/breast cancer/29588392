TILs were assessed in124 pre- and 62 posttreatment tissues (including 59 pairs). PD-L1 was assessed in120 pre- and 43 posttreatment tissues (including 39 pairs) using the 22C3antibody. Baseline and treatment-induced immune changes were correlated with pCR and survival using estrogen receptor (ER) and treatment-adjusted logistic and Coxregressions, respectively. At baseline, the mean TIL count was 17.4% (17% hadzero TILs, 9% had ≥50% TILs). Posttreatment, mean TIL count decreased to 11% (5% had no TILs, 2% had >50% TILs). In paired samples, the mean TIL change was 15%decrease. Baseline PD-L1 was detected in 43% of cases (n = 5 in tumor cells, n = 29 stroma, n = 18 tumor + stroma). Posttreatment, PD-L1 expression was notsignificantly lower (33%). Higher baseline TIL count and PD-L1 positivity ratewere associated with higher pCR rate even after adjustment for treatment and ERstatus (P = 0.018). There was no association between TIL counts, PD-L1expression, and survival due to few events. In conclusion, TIL counts, but notPD-L1 expression, decreased significantly after treatment. Continued PD-L1expression in some residual cancers raises the possibility that adjuvant immunecheckpoint inhibitor therapy could improve survival in this patient population.Mol Cancer Ther; 17(6); 1324-31. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-17-1005 PMID: 29588392
