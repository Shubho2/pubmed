Discordance between primary and recurrentbreast cancer has implications for further treatment and ultimately prognosis.The aim of the study was to determine the rate of change between primary andrecurrence of breast cancer and to assess the impact of these changes on survivaland potential treatment options.METHODS: Patient demographics were collected on those who underwent surgery forbreast cancer between 2001 and 2014 and had a recurrence with biopsy results and pathology scoring of both the primary and recurrence.RESULTS: One hundred thirty two consecutive patients were included. There were 31(23.5%) changes in subtype. Discordance occurred most frequently in luminal Abreast cancer (n = 20), followed by triple negative (n = 4), luminal B (n = 3)and HER2 (n = 3). Patients who changed from luminal A to triple negative (n = 18)had a significantly worse post-recurrence survival (p < 0.05) with overallsurvival approaching significance (p = 0.064) compared to concordant luminal Acases (n = 46). Overall receptor discordance rates were: estrogen receptor 20.4% (n = 27), progesterone receptor 37.7% (n = 50) and HER2 3% (n = 4). Loss ofestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor was more common than gain (21 vs. 6(p = 0.04) and 44 vs. 6 (p = 0.01) respectively). Nine patients (6.8%) gainedreceptor status potentially impacting treatment options.CONCLUSION: Discordance in subtype and receptor status occurs between primary andrecurrent breast cancer, ultimately affecting survival and potentially impacting treatment options.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4101-7 PMCID: PMC5819681PMID: 29463223
