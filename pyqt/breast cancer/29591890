However, great concerns exist regarding theirtoxicity in biomedical applications. Because of the lack of sufficient dataregarding the toxicity mechanism of QDs, this study aimed to evaluate thecytotoxicity of three types of QDs: CdTe QDs, high yield CdTe QDs, and CdTe/CdScore/shell QDs on two human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB468 and MCF-7.METHODS: The breast cancer cells were treated with different concentrations ofQDs, and cell viability was evaluated via MTT assay. Hoechst staining was appliedfor observation of morphological changes due to apoptosis. Apoptotic DNAfragmentation was visualized by the agarose gel electrophoresis assay. Flowcytometric annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) measurement was used for apoptosisdetection.RESULTS: A significant decrease in cell viability was observed after QDstreatment ( p < 0.05). Apoptotic bodies and chromatin condensation was observedby Hoechst staining. DNA fragmentation assay demonstrated a DNA ladder profile inthe exposed cells and also annexin V/PI flow cytometry confirmed apoptosis in adose-dependent manner.CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that CdTe, high yield CdTe, and CdTe/CdScore/shell QDs induce apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines in a dose-dependentmanner. This study would help realizing the underlying cytotoxicity mechanism, atleast partly, of CdTe QDs and may provide information for the development ofnanotoxicology and safe use of biological applications of QDs.DOI: 10.1177/0748233718763517 PMID: 29591890
