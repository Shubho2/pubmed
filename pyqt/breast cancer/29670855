The initialgeneration of HER2-targeted therapies included trastuzumab with taxanes in thefirst line, followed by the addition of lapatinib and by a switch to anothercytotoxic agent after progression. Results of CLEOPATRA, EMILIA, and TH3RESAtrials have changed this clinical practice. The current consensus includeshorizontal dual blockade (trastuzumab + pertuzumab) with taxanes or vinorelbinein the first line, followed by trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) in the second line, with addition of lapatinib in the later lines of treatment. However, the fast andsimultaneous development of new drugs led to a relative shortage of clinicalevidence to support this sequence. Triple-positive breast cancers (TPBC), whichexpress both hormonal receptors and HER2, constitute nearly half of HER2-positivecases. For these tumors, the current consensus is to add endocrine therapy after completion of cytotoxic treatment. Again, this consensus is not fullyevidence-based. In view of the recent progress in treatment of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers, a series of trials is evaluating addition of CDK4/6inhibitors, aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant to HER2-targeted and cytotoxicchemotherapy in TPBC patients. Despite the remarkable progress in treatment ofHER2-positive breast cancer, metastatic disease is still incurable in themajority of patients. A wide range of novel therapies are under development toprevent and overcome resistance to current HER2-targeted agents. This reviewdiscusses pivotal clinical trials that have shaped current clinical practices,the current consensus recommendations, and the new experimental treatments inmetastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00089 PMCID: PMC5894159PMID: 29670855
