All patients underwent MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging and spectroscopy. Image postprocessing and analysis included signalintensity, enhancement characteristics, diffusion restriction, and spectroscopic analysis. All patients underwent histopathological analysis for confirmation.Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative (NPV)predictive value were calculated.RESULTS: To label a lesion as fat necrosis on MRI analysis, presence of fatsignal in a lesion revealed sensitivity of 98.04%, specificity of 100%, PPV of100%, and NPP of 96.88%, whereas nonenhancement of the lesion itself revealedsensitivity of 96.08%, specificity of 100%, PPV of 100%, and NPP of 93.94%.However, adding both the nonrestriction on diffusion analysis and the lack oftCholine at 3.22 ppm increased the sensitivity and specificity to 100%, as wellas PPV of 100% for fat necrosis and hence a NPV for malignancy of 100%.CONCLUSIONS: MRI proved to be of value in differentiating fat necrosis frommalignancy based on the molecular composition of fat necrosis, clearly depictedby MRI without the need for invasive confirmation by biopsy.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.
