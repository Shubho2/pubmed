We evaluated patient-reported arm morbidity andphysical functioning in breast cancer patients undergoing modern-day axillarytreatment.METHODS: All patients within the UMBRELLA cohort undergoing local radiotherapywith sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), ALND and/or AxRT were selected.Patient-reported arm morbidity and physical functioning were assessed with EORTC QLQ C30/BR23 questionnaires up to eighteen months after initiation ofradiotherapy. Patient-reported outcomes were compared between patients with SLNB only, ALND only, AxRT (level I-II), AxRT (level I-IV) or AxRT plus ALND by means of mixed model analysis.RESULTS: In total, 949 patients were identified; 641 (68%) SLNB only, 57 (6%)ALND only, 94 (10%) AxRT level I-II, 72 (8%) AxRT level I-IV and 85 (9%)ALND + AxRT. SLNB only resulted in the least arm morbidity scores. ALND + AxRTresulted in most arm morbidity, with clinically relevant differences at18 months. AxRT (level I-II or level I-IV) resulted in significantly less armsymptoms in the first 3 months compared to ALND. Arm symptom scores between thosereceiving AxRT on levels I-II and I-IV were similar.CONCLUSION: Of all axillary management strategies, ALND plus AxRT is associatedwith worst patient-reported outcomes. AxRT resulted in less arm morbiditycompared to ALND. Selective radiotherapy treatment of the axilla, i.e.radiotherapy of levels I-II only instead of levels I-IV, did not lead toclinically relevant reduced arm morbidity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
