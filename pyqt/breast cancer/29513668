A total of 330 students in the first four years ofmedical undergraduate school were invited to participate in responding to thesociodemographic and Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS)questionnaires. The first-year group consisted of 150 students, followed by thesecond-, third-, and fourth-year groups, with 60 students each.RESULTS: Data from 265 students who answered at least the sociodemographicquestionnaire and the MBI-SS were analyzed (response rate = 80.3%). One (n = 1,0.3%) potential participant viewed the Informed Consent Form but did not agree toparticipate in the study. A total of 187 students (187/265, 70.6%) presented highlevels of emotional exhaustion, 140 (140/265, 52.8%) had high cynicism, and 129(129/265, 48.7%) had low academic efficacy. The two-dimensional criterionindicated that 119 (44.9%) students experienced burnout. Based on thethree-dimensional criterion, 70 students (26.4%) presented with burnout. The yearwith the highest frequency of affected students for both criteria was the firstyear (p = 0.001). Personal attributes were able to explain 11% (ΔR = 0.11) of thevariability of burnout under the two-dimensional criterion and 14.4% (R2 = 0.144)under the three-dimensional criterion.CONCLUSION: This study showed a high prevalence of burnout among medical studentsin a private school using active teaching methodologies. In the first years ofgraduation, students' personal attributes (optimism and self-perception ofhealth) and school attributes (motivation and routine of the exhaustive study)were associated with higher levels of burnout. These findings reinforce the need to establish preventive measures focused on the personal attributes of first-yearstudents, providing better performance, motivation, optimism, and empathy in the subsequent stages of the course.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0191746 PMCID: PMC5841647PMID: 29513668  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
