New treatments are needed, to bypass chemoresistance and improve survival.The WNT pathway, which is activated in TNBCs, has been identified as anattractive pathway for treatment targeting. We analyzed expression of the WNTcoreceptors LRP5 and LRP6 in human breast cancer samples. As previouslydescribed, LRP6 was overexpressed in TNBCs. However, we also showed, for thefirst time, that LRP5 was overexpressed in TNBCs too. The knockdown of LRP5 orLRP6 decreased tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo, identifying both receptors as potential treatment targets in TNBC. The apoptotic effect of LRP5 knockdown wasmore robust than that of LRP6 depletion. We analyzed and compared thetranscriptomes of cells depleted of LRP5 or LRP6, to identify genes specifically deregulated by LRP5 potentially implicated in cell death. We identifiedserine/threonine kinase 40 (STK40) as one of two genes specifically downregulatedsoon after LRP5 depletion. STK40 was found to be overexpressed in TNBCs, relativeto other breast cancer subtypes, and in various other tumor types. STK40depletion decreased cell viability and colony formation, and induced theapoptosis of TNBC cells. In addition, STK40 knockdown impaired growth in ananchorage-independent manner in vitro and slowed tumor growth in vivo. Thesefindings identify the largely uncharacterized putative protein kinase STK40 as a novel candidate treatment target for TNBC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25187 PMCID: PMC5978250PMID: 29854300
