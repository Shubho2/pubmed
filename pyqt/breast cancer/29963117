Incidence rates of cardiovascular disease were comparedbetween left-sided and right-sided RT, and stratified by age and risk factorssuch as body mass index (BMI), smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes,administration of anthracycline, and trastuzumab.Results: In all patients, the cumulative incidence of cardiovascular disease was greater in patients treated with left-sided RT than in those treated withright-sided RT, but the difference was not significant (p=0.428). Smoking (hazardratio [HR], 5.991; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.109-17.022; p=0.002) andhyperlipidemia (HR, 5.567; 95% CI, 3.235-9.580; p<0.001) were the most powerfulrisk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was no significant factor thatfurther increased the risk of cardiovascular disease after left breast RTcompared to right breast RT.Conclusion: Although hyperlipidemia and smoking are risk factors forcardiovascular disease, they have not been proven to increase the risk ofRT-related cardiovascular disease in Korean women.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.206 PMCID: PMC6015985PMID: 29963117
