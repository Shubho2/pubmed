We report on a living biobank of PDOs from metastatic, heavily pretreated colorectal and gastroesophageal cancer patients recruited in phase 1/2clinical trials. Phenotypic and genotypic profiling of PDOs showed a high degree of similarity to the original patient tumors. Molecular profiling of tumororganoids was matched to drug-screening results, suggesting that PDOs couldcomplement existing approaches in defining cancer vulnerabilities and improvingtreatment responses. We compared responses to anticancer agents ex vivo inorganoids and PDO-based orthotopic mouse tumor xenograft models with theresponses of the patients in clinical trials. Our data suggest that PDOs canrecapitulate patient responses in the clinic and could be implemented inpersonalized medicine programs.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science.
