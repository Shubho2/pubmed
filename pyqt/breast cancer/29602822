However, knowledge about varying expression across metastases andsurrounding normal tissue in patients is scarce. We therefore analyzed16α-18F-fluoro-17β-estradiol (18F-FES) PET to assess ER expression heterogeneity.Methods:18F-FES PET on accredited PET/CT camera systems performed in patientswith ER-positive metastatic breast cancer November 2009-December 2014 wasanalyzed. Lesions with an SUVmax 1.5 or more were considered ER-positive, butliver lesions were excluded given high background liver signal. CT lesions with adiameter 10 mm or more were included. We used multilevel linear-mixed models toevaluate determinants of 18F-FES uptake. Cluster analysis was performed withdifferent imaging features per patient as input variables. Results: In 91patients, 1,617 metastases in bone (78%), lymph node (15%), lung (4%), or liver(2%) were identified by CT (11.2%), PET (56.6%), or both (32.2%). Median tumoruptake varied greatly between patients (SUVmax, 0.54-14.21). 18F-FES uptake inbone metastases was higher than in lymph node and lung metastases (geometric meanSUVmax, 2.61 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.31-2.94] vs. 2.29 [95% CI,2.00-2.61; P < 0.001] vs. 2.23 [95% CI, 1.88-2.61; P = 0.021]), respectively.Cluster analysis identified 3 subgroups of patients characterized by particularmetastatic sites and 18F-FES PET/CT features. SUVmax in surrounding normaltissue, highest in the bones, varied per patient (range, 0.7-3.3).Conclusion:18F-FES uptake is heterogeneous in tumor and normal tissue andinfluenced by anatomic site. Different patterns can be distinguished, possiblyidentifying biologically relevant ER-positive metastatic breast cancer patientsubgroups.© 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.117.198846 PMID: 29602822
