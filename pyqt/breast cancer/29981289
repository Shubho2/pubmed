Emerging researchindicated that lncRNA played a vital role in human tumorigenesis and progression by serving as tumor oncogenes or suppressors. LncRNA has been shown to getinvolved in participate various biological processes, such as cell growth,anti-apoptosis, migration and invasion. LncRNA HOXA cluster antisense RNA2(HOXA-AS2) is a novel cancer-related lncRNA. It was recently found to exhibitaberrant expression in a variety of malignancies, including breast cancer,gastric cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreaticcancer. The oncogenicity of lncRNA HOXA-AS2 mainly inhibits or promotes theexpression of related genes through direct or indirect pathways, suggesting that HOXA-AS2 likely represents a feasible biomarker or therapeutic target in humancancers. In this review, we summarize current evidences concerning the biologicalfunctions and mechanisms of HOXA-AS2 during tumor development.Copyright Â© 2018.
