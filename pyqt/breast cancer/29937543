As carriers may increasinglyundergo IVF as part of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), we examined theimpact of ovarian stimulation for IVF on breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutationcarriers.METHODS: The study population consisted of 1550 BRCA1 and 964 BRCA2 mutationcarriers, derived from the nationwide HEBON study and the nationwide PGDregistry. Questionnaires, clinical records and linkages with the NetherlandsCancer Registry were used to collect data on IVF exposure, risk-reducingsurgeries and cancer diagnosis, respectively. Time-dependent Cox regressionanalyses were conducted, stratified for birth cohort and adjusted forsubfertility.RESULTS: Of the 2514 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, 3% (n = 76) were exposed toovarian stimulation for IVF. In total, 938 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (37.3%) werediagnosed with breast cancer. IVF exposure was not associated with risk of breastcancer (HR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.46-1.36). Similar results were found for thesubgroups of subfertile women (n = 232; HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.39-1.37) and BRCA1mutation carriers (HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.60-2.09). In addition, age at and recency of first IVF treatment were not associated with breast cancer risk.CONCLUSION: No evidence was found for an association between ovarian stimulation for IVF and breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0139-1 PMID: 29937543
