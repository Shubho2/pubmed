Setup variation of shielding disk can affect the corresponding in-vivo dose distribution. In this study, thechanges of dosimetric parameters due to the disk setup variations is evaluatedusing EGSnrc Monte Carlo (MC) code. The results can help treatment team to decideabout the level of accuracy in the setup procedure and delivered dose to thetarget volume during IOERT.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
