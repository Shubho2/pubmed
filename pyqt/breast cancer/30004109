[Epub ahead ofprint]High-grade encapsulated papillary carcinoma of the breast isclinicopathologically distinct from low/intermediate-grade neoplasms in Chinesepatients.Liu X(1), Wu H(1), Teng L(2), Zhang H(1), Lu J(1), Liang Z(3).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, ChineseAcademy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.(2)Department of Pathology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing,China.(3)Department of Pathology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, ChineseAcademy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.liangzhiyong1220@yahoo.com.Encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC) of the breast is typically oflow-to-intermediate grade (LTIG) with favorable prognosis. Rarely, high-grade(HG) EPC cases have been documented in recent years. Herein we compared themorphological, immunohistochemical, and clinical features of LTIG EPC to those ofHG EPC. Of the 30 EPC patients, 25 were diagnosed as LTIG and five as HG (median age: 60 and 36 years, respectively); 80% of the HG EPCs exhibited predominantlysolid architecture with prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, more crowded andthicker papillae, and greater stratification and irregular arrangement ofmalignant epithelial cells. Coexisting invasive components were observed in 32%and 80% of LTIG and HG cases, respectively. HG EPC was negative for hormonereceptor staining. Additionally, 48% of LTIG EPC cases were moderately positivefor human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2) immunostaining (2+); amongthem, one case showed Her-2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situhybridization. The basal-like markers cytokeratin 5/6 and epidermal growth factorreceptor were detected in two and five HG cases, respectively. HG EPC was alsocharacterized by a significantly high Ki-67 index (median: 85%, P<0.001). Nolocal recurrence or distant metastasis was noted during the follow-up. HG EPCtypically exhibited a solid architecture with a concurrent invasive component as well as a triple-negative and basal-like immunophenotype in young women. HG EPCmight be indicative of high proliferative activity and potential aggressiveness.DOI: 10.14670/HH-18-026 PMID: 30004109
