However, the functional roles and targetedgenes of Twist in EMT and cancer progression remain elusive. Methods: Thepotential targeted genes of Twist were identified from the global transcriptomes of T47D/Twist cells by microarray analysis. EMT phenotype was detected by westernblotting and immunofluorescence of marker proteins. The dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were employed to observe the directtranscriptional induction of ROR1 by Twist. A lung metastasis model was used tostudy the pro-metastatic role of Twist and ROR1 by injecting MDA-MB-231 cellsinto tail vein of nude mice. Bio-informatics analysis was utilized to measure themetastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients. Results: Twist protein wasproved to directly activate the transcription of ROR1 gene, a receptor of Wnt5ain non-canonical WNT signaling pathway. Silencing of ROR1 inhibited EMT process, cell migration, invasion, and cancer metastasis of basal-like breast cancer(BLBC) cells. Knockdown of ROR1 also ameliorated the pro-metastatic effect ofTwist. Furthermore, analyses of clinical specimens indicated that high expressionof both ROR1 and Twist tightly correlates with poor metastasis-free survival ofbreast cancer patients. Conclusion: ROR1 is a targeted gene of Twist. Twist/ROR1 signaling is critical for invasion and metastasis of BLBC cells.DOI: 10.7150/thno.21477 PMCID: PMC5957006PMID: 29774072
