Aberrant MAPK signaling plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis, which leads todevelopment and progression of human cancer. Dual-specificity phosphatase 6(DUSP6), a member of the MAPK phosphatase family, interacts with specificallytargeted extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 via negative feedbackregulation in the MAPK pathway of mammalian cells. This phosphatase functions in a dual manner, pro-oncogenic or tumor-suppressive, depending on the type ofcancer. To date, the tumor-suppressive role of DUSP6 has been demonstrated inpancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell andnasopharyngeal carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. Its pro-oncogenic role has beenobserved in human glioblastoma, thyroid carcinoma, breast cancer, and acutemyeloid carcinoma. Both roles of DUSP6 have been documented in malignant melanomadepending on the histological subtype of the cancer. Loss- or gain-of-functioneffects of DUSP6 in these cancers highlights the significance of this phosphatasein carcinogenesis. Development of methods that use the DUSP6 gene as atherapeutic target for cancer treatment or as a prognostic factor for diagnosisand evaluation of cancer treatment outcome has great potential. This reviewfocuses on molecular characteristics of the DUSP6 gene and its role in cancers inthe purview of development, progression, and cancer treatment outcome.DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0107 PMCID: PMC5842331PMID: 29545965
