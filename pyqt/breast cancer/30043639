[Epub ahead of print]FOXA1 knock-out via CRISPR/Cas9 altered Casp-9, Bax, CCND1, CDK4, and fibronectinexpressions in LNCaP cells.Albayrak G(1), Konac E(1), Ugras Dikmen A(2), Bilen CY(3).Author information: (1)1 Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, GaziUniversity, 06510 Ankara, Turkey.(2)2 Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, 06510Ankara, Turkey.(3)3 Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, 06100Ankara, Turkey.Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men and the leading cause of death in developed countries. With the aid of molecular and geneticprofiling of cancers, cancer molecular subtypes are paving the way for tailoredcancer therapy. FOXA1 has been identified as one of the seven molecular subtypes of prostate cancer. FOXA1 is involved in a variety of metabolic process such asglucose homeostasis and deregulation of its expression is crucial in prostatecancer progression. In this study, we investigated the effects of FOXA1 geneknock-out on the expression levels of various cancer cell metabolism and cellcycle-related protein expressions. FOXA1 gene was knocked-out by usingCRISPR/Cas9 technique. While FOXA1 gene knock-out significantly altered Casp-9,Bax, CCND1, CDK4, and fibronectin protein expressions (P < 0.05, fold change:∼40, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 4, respectively), it did not affect the proteinexpression levels of Casp-3, Bcl-2, survivin, β-catenin, c-Myc, and GSK-3B.Knocking-out FOXA1 gene in androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cellsinhibited CCND1 protein expression. Our pre-clinical results demonstrate theimportance of FOXA1 as a drug target in the treatment of prostate cancer. Impact statement Knock-out studies offer a unique way of studying the function of genes especially for developmentally lethal genes. FOXA1 has prominent roles both inbreast and prostate cancer pathogenesis due to its role in ER receptor signaling pathway. FOXA1 has also been identified as one of the seven molecular subtypes ofprimary prostate cancer. In the present study, we used an efficient geneknock-out method, CRISPR/Cas9, in order to investigate FOXA1 function on LNCaPprostate cancer cells in vitro. FOXA1 knock-out altered cell-cycle regulatorCCND1 protein expression levels. Therefore, our results suggest that FOXA1 might be a plausible drug target for prostate cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1177/1535370218791797 PMID: 30043639
