We evaluated therelationship between age (< 50 vs. ≥ 50 years), recurrence score (RS),chemotherapy use, and trends of oDX testing over time.METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database, we identified women with T1/T2, N0, estrogen receptor-positive BC from 2009 to 2014. We stratified patients by age(< 50 and ≥ 50 years) and RS (low: < 18; intermediate: 18-30; and high: > 30),and compared demographics, tumor characteristics, and chemotherapyrecommendations. Management trends were also assessed.RESULTS: From 2009 to 2014, a total of 377,725 cases met the eligibility criteriafor oDX testing; 115,052 (30.5%) patients had oDX, and 60,804 (16.1%) were< 50 years of age. The majority had low RS and T1N0 disease. Patients < 50 years of age were more likely to be recommended chemotherapy than those ≥ 50 years ofage, regardless of RS (p ≤ 0.001), and were more likely to ultimately undergochemotherapy (p < 0.001). When stratified by year, oDX utilization increased.There was a decreasing trend in chemotherapy recommendations in both the low- andintermediate-RS groups for both age groups (all p = 0.001), with no change in thehigh-RS group (< 50 years: p = 0.52; ≥ 50 years: p = 0.67). Univariate andmultivariate analyses demonstrated that patients < 50 years of age and those witha higher RS were more likely to be recommended chemotherapy (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The testing of oDX in BC has significantly increased since firstimplemented. Results from additional studies such as TAILORx will clarify thecurrent discordant practice patterns between low oDX RSs and adjuvantchemotherapy recommendations.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6600-9 PMID: 29959613
