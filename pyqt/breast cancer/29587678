To achieve health benefits,women must attend breast screening regularly at recommended time intervals.Maltese women are routinely invited to undergo mammography at three-yearintervals at an organized breast screening programme (MBSP) or can opt to attend a private clinic. Previous research shows that health beliefs, particularlyperceived barriers, were the most significant predictors of uptake to the firstMBSP invitation. Whether these beliefs and other factors are predictive ofadherence with recommended time intervals for mammography at organized or privatescreening in Malta is unknown. For the first time, this paper explores thepredictors for Maltese women screened within or exceeding the recommendedthree-year frequency in organized or private screening in Malta.METHODS: Information was obtained from a cross-sectional survey of 404 women,aged 50 to 60 years at the time of their first MBSP invitation, where women'scharacteristics, knowledge, health beliefs and illness perceptions were compared.The main variable of interest was women's mammography attendance within athree-year interval (ADHERENT) or exceeding three years (NON-ADHERENT). Data wereanalysed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, Mann Whitney test,Independent Samples t-test and Shapiro Wilk test.RESULTS: At the time of the survey, 80.2% (n = 324) had been screened withinthree years (ADHERENT), 5.9% (n = 24) had exceeded the three-year frequency(NON-ADHERENT) while 13.9% (n = 56) never had a mammogram. No significantassociations were found between ADHERENT or NON-ADHERENT women in relation tosociodemographic or health status variables (p > 0.05). Knowledge of screeningfrequency was significantly associated with women's mammography adherence(χ2 = 5.5, p = 0.020). Health beliefs were the strongest significant predictorsto describe the variance between ADHERENT and NON-ADHERENT screeners. When MannWhitney test and Independent Samples t-test were applied on mammographyadherence, perceived barriers and cues to action were found to be the mostimportant predictors (p = 0.000, p = 0.039 respectively).CONCLUSIONS: To increase routine and timely mammography practices, women who are non-adherent to recommended time frequency guidelines should be targeted,together with their health beliefs, predominantly perceived barriers and cues to action.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4278-9 PMCID: PMC5870824PMID: 29587678
