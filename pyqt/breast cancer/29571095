National screening programs have been established in whicheligible women receive a letter containing a voucher for a free screening. Evenso, mammography use is often considered as remaining too low. We test fourbehavioral interventions in a large-scale randomized experiment involving 26,495 women. Our main assumption is that, due to biases in decision-making, women maybe sensitive to the content and presentation of the invitation letter theyreceive. None of our treatments had any significant impact on mammography use.Sub-sample analysis suggests that this lack of a significant impact holds alsofor women invited for the first time and low-income women.Copyright © 2017.
