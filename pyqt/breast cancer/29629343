We have previously reported that the mutation ofSmad3 linker phosphorylation sites (Smad3-Erk/Pro-directed kinase site mutantconstructs [EPSM]) markedly reduced the tumor progression while increasing thelung metastasis in breast cancer.Methods: We performed high-throughput RNA-Sequencing of the human prostate cancercell lines infected with adenoviral Smad3-EPSM to identify the genes regulated bySmad3-EPSM.Results: In this study, we identified genes which are differentially regulated inthe presence of Smad3-EPSM. We first confirmed that Smad3-EPSM strongly enhanced a capability of cell motility and invasiveness as well as the expression ofepithelial-mesenchymal transition marker genes, CDH2, SNAI1, and ZEB1 in responseto TGF-Î²1 in human pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines. We identifiedGADD45B, CTGF, and JUNB genes in the expression profiles associated with cellmotility and invasiveness induced by the Smad3-EPSM.Conclusions: These results suggested that inhibition of Smad3 linkerphosphorylation may enhance cell motility and invasiveness by inducing expressionof GADD45B, CTGF, and JUNB genes in various cancers.DOI: 10.15430/JCP.2018.23.1.1 PMCID: PMC5886489PMID: 29629343
