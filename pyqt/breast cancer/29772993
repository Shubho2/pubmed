These enzymes are destructive to periarticulartissue, including the synovium, articular cartilage, rotator cuff muscles, andthe intrasynovial cortical bone. MSS predominantly occurring in women (90%) over the age of 70 years of age with a clinical history marked by recurrent jointeffusions and pain, which classically worsens at night. Our patient is a69-year-old woman who presented with progressive shoulder pain, most prominent atnight, with limited range of motion and swelling; intermittent discharge; andintermittent neck pain that radiated to her right upper extremity. Her medicalhistory was notable for invasive carcinoma of the right breast treated withmastectomy and radiation. She was also treated with radiation therapy for rightshoulder pain and a lucent right shoulder lesion presumed to be metastatic breastcancer. The remainder of her medical history consists of hypertension, diabetesmellitus, hyperlipidemia, and uneventful bilateral total knee arthroplasties. At presentation, she denied constitutional symptoms. Based on the patient's history and physical exam the differential diagnosis included primary and metastaticmalignancy, radiation induced sarcoma and necrosis, infection, Charcot disease,and crystal arthropathies. Physical exam, laboratory findings, and imagingstudies led us to the diagnosis of MSS.DOI: 10.1615/JLongTermEffMedImplants.2017020612 PMID: 29772993
