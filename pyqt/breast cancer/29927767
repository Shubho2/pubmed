In a large-scale technology-based breast cancer interventionstudy, research team members wrote memos on issues in implementing a culturallytailored technology-based intervention and plausible reasons for the issues.Then, the content of the research diaries was analyzed, along with writtenrecords of the research team. The practical issues found in the research process included those related to (1) technology literacy and preferences; (2) languageissues; (3) cultural attitudes, beliefs, and values; (4) intervention staffcompetence; (5) security and confidentiality issues; and (6) time andgeographical constraints. Based on the issues, several recommendations areproposed for future research using culturally tailored technology-basedinterventions among racial and ethnic minorities.DOI: 10.1097/CIN.0000000000000450 PMID: 29927767
