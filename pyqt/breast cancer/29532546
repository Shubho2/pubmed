Epub 2018 Mar 13.Adjuvant continuous metronomic adriamycin + cyclophosphamide followed by weeklynab-paclitaxel for high-risk early-stage breast cancer.Cho E(1), Wu Q(2), Rubinstein L(3), Linden H(4), Gralow J(4), Specht J(4), GadiV(2)(3)(4), Ellis G(3)(4).Author information: (1)Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.(2)Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.(3)Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA, USA.(4)University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Many studies have sought to optimize the dosing schedule of adjuvant chemotherapyin early-stage breast cancer. Here, we assessed the use of continuous metronomic weekly doxorubicin plus daily oral cyclophosphamide (AC) with continuous G-CSFgrowth factor support for 12 weeks followed by weekly nab-paclitaxel (nP) for 12 weeks. A nonrandomized phase II clinical trial was designed to assess (1) DFS at 2 years, (2) dose delivered, (3) use of nP in the adjuvant setting, and (4)toxicities. The dosing of A was 24 mg/m2 IV weekly and C was 60 mg/m2 oral daily (with scheduled filgrastim 5mcg/kg 6 days/week); nP, 100 mg/m2 IV weekly. Forpatients with HER2 + disease, trastuzumab was started during the nP portion oftherapy and continued for 12 months. Sixty patients enrolled with a medianfollow-up of 6 years. Node-positive disease was present in 58% of patients.Receptor categories included hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative (n = 25;42%); triple negative (n = 19; 32%); or HER2 positive (n = 16; 27%). DFS at 2years was 93%. Mean dose delivered was greater than 90% for metronomic AC and 88%for nP. Treatment was well tolerated with a 2% incidence of febrile neutropenia. Continuous metronomic AC followed by nP was well tolerated in our patients withcomparable DFS to historical controls.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13013 PMID: 29532546
