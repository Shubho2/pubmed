We present computational analysis of resistance (CARE), acomputational method focused on targeted therapies, to infer genome-widetranscriptomic signatures of drug efficacy from cell line compound screens. CARE outputs genome-scale scores to measure how the drug target gene interacts withother genes to affect the inhibitor efficacy in the compound screens. Suchstatistical interactions between drug targets and other genes were not consideredin previous studies but are critical in identifying predictive biomarkers. Whenevaluated using transcriptome data from clinical studies, CARE can predict thetherapy outcome better than signatures from other computational methods andgenomics experiments. Moreover, the CARE signatures for the PLX4720 BRAFinhibitor are associated with an anti-programmed death 1 clinical response,suggesting a common efficacy signature between a targeted therapy andimmunotherapy. When searching for genes related to lapatinib resistance, CAREidentified PRKD3 as the top candidate. PRKD3 inhibition, by both smallinterfering RNA and compounds, significantly sensitized breast cancer cells tolapatinib. Thus, CARE should enable large-scale inference of response biomarkers and drug combinations for targeted therapies using compound screen data.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
