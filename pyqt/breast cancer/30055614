However, there is lessevidence from observational epidemiological research and the results areequivocal. Therefore, we examined the association between occupational exposureto substances where exposure to EDCs is likely and the risk of breast cancer.METHODS: A prospective study consisting of a population-based cohort of 33,458Singaporean Chinese women aged 45-74 years enrolled in the Singapore ChineseHealth Study (SCHS) from 1993 to 98 and followed through 2014. Subjects'self-reported occupational exposure and duration to industries, job titles, andsubstance types were garnered at baseline, and cases of incident breast cancer(N = 988) were determined by linkage with the Singapore Cancer Registry. Hazardratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for exposure tosubstances, job titles, and industries.RESULTS: There was no association between cumulative exposure to substances viaoccupation where EDC exposure is likely and risk of breast cancer. These results were consistent for hypothesized high (HR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.66-1.35), medium (HR1.03 95% CI: 0.77-1.38) and low (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.13) combined substanceexposure groups when compared with those who were not exposed via occupation.Similar null associations were observed when examining job titles and industrycategories.CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between EDC related occupational exposures and breast cancer risk in working women of the Singaporean Chinese Health Study. Future studies that employ rigorous methods with regard to exposure assessment ofEDCs are needed.DOI: 10.1186/s12889-018-5862-2 PMCID: PMC6064056PMID: 30055614
