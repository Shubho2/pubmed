However, scientific investigations onefficacy and toxicity of most of these products are not done. The aim of thestudy was to assess the anticancer potentials of herbal products on the Ghanaian market. Antiproliferative effects of Kantinka BA (K-BA), Kantinka Herbaltics(K-HER), Centre of Awareness (COA), a stomach (STO) and multicancer (MUT) productwere evaluated in vitro using liver (Hep G2), breast (MCF-7), prostate (PC-3 and LNCaP), and blood (Jurkat) cancer cell lines. Cytotoxicity of the medicinalproducts was assessed using tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay, and totalphenolic content and antioxidant activity of the products were determined usingFolin-Ciocalteau and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays, respectively.Phytochemical screening resulted in the detection of terpenoids and flavonoids inmost of the products, and alkaloids were detected in only MUT. Tannins wereabsent from all the products. The highest and lowest concentrations of phenolics were recorded for MUT and K-BA, respectively. The highest and lowest antioxidant activities were measured for MUT and K-HER, respectively. Only 2 products (STOand MUT) were cytotoxic to Hep G2 cells; with MUT being the only product that wascytotoxic to MCF-7 cells. All but K-BA were cytotoxic to PC-3 cells, while allproducts except K-HER were cytotoxic to LNCaP and Jurkat cells. The study thusconfirms that the herbal products have selective cytotoxic activities against thetested cancer cell lines. However, comprehensive toxicity studies must beconducted to establish their safety.DOI: 10.1177/2515690X18790723 PMID: 30088418
