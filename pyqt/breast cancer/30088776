In subgroup analysis, performing surgery and no radiation orchemotherapy led to worse prognosis in research group. Among stage IV patients,chemotherapy correlated with better prognosis and radiation led to better breast cancer-specific survival. In addition, brain and liver metastasis correlated withworse prognosis; and lung correlated with worse breast cancer-specific survival.CONCLUSION: For stage I-III patients, surgery and chemotherapy were recommended. And not applying radiation or chemotherapy could be carefully considered for ER(+) HER-2(-) patients. For stage IV patients, chemotherapy and radiation werecommended.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2018-0455 PMID: 30088776
