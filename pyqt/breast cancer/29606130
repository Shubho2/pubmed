We have recently reported properties of pro-inflammatory (for treatment of various types of cancers), and anti-inflammatory (for cardiovascular diseaseand diabetes) compounds. The major problem associated with development ofanticancer drugs is their lack of solubility in aqueous solutions and severe sideeffects in cancer patients. Therefore, the present study was carried out to checkanticancer properties of selected compounds, mostly aqueous soluble, in cancercell lines from different organs.METHODS: The anticancer properties, anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptoticactivity of novel naturally occurring or FDA approved, nontoxic, proteasomeinhibitors/activators were compared. In addition to that, effect of δ-tocotrienolon expression of proteasome subunits (X, Y, Z, LMP7, LMP2, LMP10), ICAM-1,VCAM-1, and TNF-α using total RNAs derived from plasmas of hepatitis C patientswas investigated.RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that following compounds are very effective ininducing apoptosis of cancer cells: Thiostrepton, dexamethasone,2-methoxyestradiol, δ-tocotrienol, quercetin, amiloride, and quinine sulfate havesignificant anti-proliferation properties in Hela cells (44% - 87%) with doses of2.5-20 μM, compared to respective controls. Anti-proliferation properties ofthiostrepton, 2-methoxyestradiol, δ-tocotrienol, and quercetin were 70% - 92%.However, thiostrepton, dexamethasone, 2-methoxyestradiol, δ-tocotrienol,quercetin, and quinine sulphate were effective in pancreatic, prostate, breast,lungs, melanoma, Β-lymphocytes, and T-cells (Jurkat: 40% to 95%) compared torespective controls. In lung cancer cells, these compounds were effective between5 and 40 μM. The IC50 values of anti-proliferation properties of thiostrepton in most of these cell lines were between doses of 2.5-5 μM, dexamethasone 2.5-20 μM,2-methoxyestradiol 2.5-10 μM, δ-tocotrienol 2.5-20 μM, quercetin 10-40 μM, and(-) Corey lactone 40-80 μM. In hepatitis C patients, δ-tocotrienol treatmentresulted in significant decrease in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate effectiveness of several natural-occurringcompounds with anti-proliferative properties against cancer cells of severalorgans of humans. Thiostrepton, dexamethasone, 2-methoxyestradiol, δ-tocotrienol and quercetin are very effective for apoptosis of cancer cells in liver,pancreas, prostate, breast, lung, melanoma, Β-lymphocytes and T-cells. Theresults have provided an opportunity to test these compounds either individually or in combination as dietary supplements in humans for treatment of various typesof cancers.DOI: 10.1186/s12944-018-0697-5 PMCID: PMC5879737PMID: 29606130
