Whiletumor expression of PD-L1 has been shown to have objective responses toanti-PD-L1 immunotherapies, the clinical implications of CTLA-4 expression intumor cells or immune cells in the tumor microenvironment is still controversial.We investigated the expression of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 in human breast tumors andprovided a scoring system for the systematic evaluation of CTLA-4 staining.METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining for PD-L1 and CTLA-4 expression wasperformed on a tissue microarray of 102 cores, which included normal andneoplastic breast tissues. Neoplastic cores were divided into four groups: Ductalcarcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobularcarcinoma (ILC) and invasive tubular carcinoma (ITC). PD-L1 and CTLA-4expressions were scored based on a system which accounted for the percentage and intensity of positivity and results provided in conjunction with availableclinical and demographic data.RESULTS: Overall, CTLA-4 was over-expressed in 49 of 93 (52.7%) breast tumors.Subcategorically, CTLA-4 was positive in 3 of 8 (37.5%) ductal carcinoma in situ,40 of 73 (55%) of invasive ductal carcinomas, 4 of 10 (40%) of invasive lobularcarcinomas and 2 of 2 (100%) of invasive tubular carcinomas. All 6 normal breast tissues were interpreted as negative for CTLA-4 staining. Only 4.1% of theinvasive ductal carcinomas were positive for PD-L1 reactivity and the remainingcarcinomas stained negative.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a significant overexpression of CTLA-4 in >50% ofbreast carcinomas with no such overexpression of CTLA-4 in benign breast tissues.PDL-1 staining is seen in only a small number of invasive ductal carcinomas(4.1%). These findings suggest the need for further investigation of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies and their efficacy in the treatment of breastcarcinomas with overexpression of these immune modulators. In addition, theproposed scoring system will facilitate a more systematic correlation betweentumor reactivity and clinical outcome which can be applied to allintracytoplasmic tumor markers.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195958 PMCID: PMC5909602PMID: 29672601  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
