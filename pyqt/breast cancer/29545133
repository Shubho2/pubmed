Therefore, studies on nanocarrier systems designed forendoglin-directed diagnostic and drug delivery purposes would expose thefeasibility of targeting endoglin with therapeutics.METHODS: Liposomes carrying high concentrations of a near-infrared fluorescentdye in the aqueous interior were prepared by the lipid film hydration andextrusion procedure, then conjugated to single chain antibody fragments eitherselective for murine endoglin (termed mEnd-IL) or directed towards human endoglin(termed hEnd-IL). A combination of Dynamic Light Scattering, electron microscopy,cell binding and uptake assays, confocal microscopy and in vivo fluorescenceimaging of mice bearing xenografted human breast cancer and human fibrosarcomamodels were implemented to elucidate the potentials of the liposomes.RESULTS: The mEnd-IL and hEnd-IL were highly selective for the respective murine-and human endoglin expressing cells in vitro and in vivo. Hence, the hEnd-ILbound distinctly to the tumor cells and enabled suitable fluorescence imaging of the tumors, whereas the mEnd-IL bound the tumor vasculature, but also to theliver, kidney and lung vasculature of mice.CONCLUSIONS: The work highlights key differences between targeting vascular(murine) and neoplastic (human) endoglin in animal studies, and suggests that thehEnd-IL can serve as a delivery system that targets human endoglin overexpressed in pathological conditions.GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The endoglin-targeting liposomes presented herewithrepresent strategic tools for the future implementation of endoglin-directedneoplastic and anti-angiogenic therapies.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
