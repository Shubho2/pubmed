[Epub ahead of print]The Pif1 signature motif of Pfh1 is necessary for both protein displacement andhelicase unwinding activities, but is dispensable for strand-annealing activity.Mohammad JB(1), Wallgren M(1), Sabouri N(1).Author information: (1)Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Umeå University, SE-901 87,Umeå, Sweden.Pfh1, the sole member of the Pif1 helicases in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, ismultifunctional and essential for maintenance of both the nuclear andmitochondrial genomes. However, we lack mechanistic insights into the functionsof Pfh1 and its different motifs. This paper is specifically concerned with theimportance of the Pif1 signature motif (SM), a 23 amino acids motif unique toPif1 helicases, because a single amino acid substitution in this motif isassociated with increased risk of breast cancer in humans and inviability in S.pombe. Here we show that the nuclear isoform of Pfh1 (nPfh1) unwound RNA/DNAhybrids more efficiently than DNA/DNA, suggesting that Pfh1 resolves RNA/DNAstructures like R-loops in vivo. In addition, nPfh1 displaced proteins from DNAand possessed strand-annealing activity. The unwinding and protein displacementactivities were dependent on the SM because nPfh1 without a large portion of thismotif (nPfh1-Δ21) or with the disease/inviability-linked mutation (nPfh1-L430P)lost these properties. Unexpectedly, both nPfh1-L430P and nPfh1-Δ21 stilldisplayed binding to G-quadruplex DNA and demonstrated strand-annealing activity.Misregulated strand annealing and binding of nPfh1-L430P without unwinding areperhaps the reasons that cells expressing this allele are inviable.DOI: 10.1093/nar/gky654 PMID: 30053106
