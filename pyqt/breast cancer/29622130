Electronic address: John.Lewin@thewomensimagingcenter.net.Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is a contrast-enhanced modality for breastcancer detection that utilizes iodinated contrast and dual-energy imagingperformed on a digital mammography unit with only slight modifications. It isapproved by the US Food and Drug Administration, commercially available, and inroutine clinical use at centers around the world. It has similar sensitivity and specificity to MR Imaging and has advantages in terms of cost, patientacceptability, and examination time. MR Imaging has some advantages compared withCEM, especially in its ability to image the complete axilla and the chest wall.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
