Progestin action is mediated through two progesterone receptor(PR) isoforms, PRA and PRB, with unique transcriptional activity and function.The current study examines hormonal regulation of PR isoforms in the normalpostmenopausal human breast and the mechanism by which progestins increaseproliferation and breast cancer risk. Archival benign breast biopsies frompostmenopausal and premenopausal women, and luminal breast tumor biopsies frompostmenopausal women, were analyzed for regulation of PRA and PRB expression by Eand E+medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). In the postmenopausal breast withoutHRT, PRA and PRB expression was decreased compared to the premenopausal breast.Both E (n = 12) and E+MPA (n = 13) HRT in the postmenopausal breast wereassociated with increased PRA and PRB expression, increased nuclear cyclin Eexpression, and decreased nuclear p27 expression compared to no HRT (n = 16).With E+MPA HRT, there was a further decrease in nuclear p27 and increasedReceptor Activator of NF-kappa B Ligand (RANKL) expression compared to E-aloneHRT. In luminal breast cancers, E+MPA HRT (n = 6) was also associated withdecreased nuclear expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 compared to E HRT (n= 6), but was not associated with increased proliferation. These results suggest that p27 mediates progestin-induced proliferation in the normal human breast and that regulation of this proliferative response by E+MPA is lost in breast tumors.Copyright Â© 2018.
