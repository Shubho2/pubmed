At the same time, there are still manyquestions concerning the role of individual cytokines and receptors for cytokinesin various morphogenetic processes underlying the tumor progression. Theobjective of this work was to study cytokine production and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-R2 and VEGF-R1 expression by mammary adenocarcinoma (MAC)and the correlations with histopathological parameters of malignant tumors. Theobject of the study was cultured tumor biopsy samples from 47 women aged43-75 years with invasive ductal carcinoma, which was classified as grade II-III adenocarcinoma. It was shown that the cytokine profiles of the supernatants ofMAC samples from patients differ greatly. A correlation between the levels ofVEGF-R2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-R1 expression was observed. Correlations were also revealed during analysis of the relations of histopathological MACindicators with KVEGF-R2/VEGF-A and KTNF-R1/TNF-α coefficients, which are equal, respectively, to the ratio of expression values of receptors VEGF-R2 and TNF-R1to the concentrations of the relevant cytokines (VEGF-A and TNF-α) in the culturesupernatants of the same MAC samples. A direct correlation was identified betweenKVEGF-R/VEGF-A and some histopathological MAC characteristics: proportion ofcells undergoing mitosis or pathological mitosis in MAC and poorly differentiatedcells. KVEGF-R2/VEGF-A directly correlated with the concentration in supernatant interleukin (IL)-18 and interferon (IFN)-γ. KTNF-R1/TNF-α was inverselycorrelated with the concentration in supernatant of IL-1Ra, IL-8, andgranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The data obtained showthat the high-level production of IL-18 and IL-1β by MAC, overexpression ofVEGF-R2 in tumor (at relatively low VEGF-A production), and the high level ofIFN-γ production are attributed factors contributing to the formation of apopulation of low-grade cells in the tumor. The factors regulating the populationof moderately differentiated cells in the tumor are referred to as IL-1Ra, IL-8, and GM-CSF.DOI: 10.1177/2058738418787990 PMCID: PMC6073826PMID: 29985074
