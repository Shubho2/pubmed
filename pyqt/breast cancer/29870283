PC use was identified using theV66.7 ICD-9 code. Factors associated with the cost of hospitalization wereidentified using multivariable gamma regression.RESULTS: During the study period, 124,186 hospitalizations were identified with aprimary diagnosis of malignancy (melanoma, breast, colon, gynecologic, prostate, male genitourinary, head/neck, urinary tract, noncolon gastrointestinal, lung,brain, bone/soft tissue, endocrine, or nonlung thoracic). Most patients weretreated at a teaching hospital (51-77% by cancer type), and use of PC ranged from10% for patients with endocrine cancers to 31% for patients with melanoma.Patients utilizing PC had a lower frequency of operative procedures (4-33% vs.34-79% by cancer type, all p ≤ 0.001), a higher rate of in-hospital death (30-45%vs. 4-10% by cancer type, all p < 0.001), and a lower total hospitalization cost (median: $5076-17,151 vs. $10,918-29,287 by cancer type, p ≤ 0.01 except malegenitourinary). In an adjusted analysis, the cost of hospitalization wassignificantly associated (all p < 0.001) with patient gender, race, age,operative, in-hospital death, extended length of stay, and PC.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, inpatient PC utilization varied by cancer type. PC wasassociated with lower utilization of surgical procedures, shorter length of stay,and lower hospitalization cost. Lower hospitalization cost was also seen forpatients who were older, female, or African American.DOI: 10.1089/jpm.2018.0003 PMID: 29870283
