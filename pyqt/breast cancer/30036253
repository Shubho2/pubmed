They underwent PET/CT scans30 minutes after intravenous injection of Ga-NOTA-RM26 in a dose of 1.85 MBq(0.05 mCi) per kilogram body weight within 1 week before surgery. TheGa-NOTA-RM26 uptake was correlated with the pathological and immunohistochemical findings.RESULTS: Ga-NOTA-RM26 positivity was found correlated with estrogen receptor (ER)expression (P = 0.006) and menstrual status (P = 0.019). In 34 patients diagnosedwith breast cancer, the SUVmax was found significantly higher in the ER-positive breast cancer (4.97 ± 1.89) than in the ER-negative breast cancer (2.78 ± 0.65, P< 0.001). Ga-NOTA-RM26 was also found accumulated in normal breast tissue, withthe SUVmax significantly higher in patients at the secretory phase of menstrualcycle (2.27 ± 0.71) than in those at the nonsecretory phase (1.59 ± 0.49, P =0.017) and postmenopause (1.43 ± 0.44, P = 0.002). If the secretory phasepatients were excluded, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy fordifferentiation of breast cancer from breast tissue increased from 85.3%, 86.8%, and 86.1% to 100%, 90.9%, and 95.5%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study indicates that the diagnostic accuracy ofGa-NOTA-RM26 PET/CT in breast cancer may correlate with ER expression andmenstrual status of the patient. It may be better to avoid performing thisexamination during the menstrual secretory phase to reduce physiological uptakein normal breast tissue.DOI: 10.1097/RLU.0000000000002209 PMCID: PMC6076351 [Available on 2019-09-01]PMID: 30036253
