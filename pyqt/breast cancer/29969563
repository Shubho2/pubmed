The latter belong to a very-aggressive and drug-resistant form ofmalignancy. Although humanized anti-EGFR antibodies can work efficiently against these cancers both as monotherapy and in combination with genotoxic drugs,instability and high production costs are some of their known drawbacks inclinical use. In addition, the development of antibodies to target membraneproteins is a very challenging task. Accordingly, the main focus of the presentwork is the design of supramolecular agents for the targeting of membraneproteins in cancer cells and, hence, more-specific drug delivery. These wereproduced using a novel double-imprinting approach based on the solid-phase methodfor preparation of molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles (nanoMIPs), which were loaded with doxorubicin and targeted toward a linear epitope of EGFR.Additionally, upon binding, doxorubicin-loaded anti-EGFR nanoMIPs elicitedcytotoxicity and apoptosis only in those cells that over-expressed EGFR. Thus,this approach can provide a plausible alternative to conventional antibodies and sets up a new paradigm for the therapeutic application of this class of materialsagainst clinically relevant targets. Furthermore, nanoMIPs can promote thedevelopment of cell imaging tools against difficult targets such as membraneproteins.DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b03206 PMID: 29969563
