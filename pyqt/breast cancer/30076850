Moreover, suppressing SPZ1-Twist1 axis decreased thegrowth of tumor xenografts. Notably, we found a positive correlation between SPZ1and Twist1 in breast cancer samples from patients with anthracycline ortaxane-based chemotherapy. Thus, our results revealed a novel role of SPZ1 as an inducer of chemoresistance and aggressiveness under chemotherapy, and thissuggests that therapeutic targeting of SPZ1 may not only enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer to chemotherapy, but also suppress breast cancer invasion andmetastases.Copyright Â© 2018.
