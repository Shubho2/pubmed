In this way,this study aimed to evaluate the infusion order of antineoplastic agents of themain therapeutic protocols used in the treatment of colorectal and breast cancer which are used in a tertiary hospital, identifying possible interactionsdependent on the infusion sequence. For the definition of protocols adopted inthe hospital, medical prescriptions were used in the period of January to March2016 and a literature review was conducted to search for studies assessing thesequence of administering the selected regimens. The databases used were SciELO, LILACS and MEDLINE, in addition to Micromedex Solutions® and UpToDate®. A totalof 19 protocols were identified for antineoplastic therapy, 11 for colorectalcancer and 8 for breast cancer. The selected articles provided evidence foradministration order of 19 protocols, and three protocols did no report relevanceof infusion sequence. Sequence-dependent interactions were mainly related totoxicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the drug combination. The definitionof the infusion sequence has a great impact on the optimization of therapy,increasing efficacy and safety of the protocols containing combinedantineoplastic therapies.DOI: 10.1590/S1679-45082018RW4074 PMCID: PMC5995553PMID: 29898094  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
