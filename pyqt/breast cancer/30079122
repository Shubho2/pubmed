Unlike previous microfluidic IHC studies, ourmicrofluidic chip made of organic solvent-resistant polyurethane acrylate (PUA)is capable of conducting on-chip IHC processes consecutively. A narrow channelwall structure of the PUA chip shows effective sealing by pressure-basedreversible assembly with a section slide. We performed both on-chip IHC andconventional IHC processes and compared the IHC results based on theimmunostaining intensity. The result showed that the effects of the on-chipdeparaffinization, antigen retrieval, and immunoreaction processes on the IHCresult were equivalent to conventional methods while reducing the total processtime to less than 1/2. The experiment with breast cancer tissue shows that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) classification can be performed byobtaining a clearly distinguishable immunostaining intensity according to theHER2 expression level. We expect our on-chip microfluidic platform to provide afacile technique suitable for miniaturized, automated, and precise diagnosticdevices, including a point-of-care device.DOI: 10.1063/1.5042347 PMCID: PMC6053317 [Available on 2019-07-19]PMID: 30079122
