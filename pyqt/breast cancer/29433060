HA-C16 copolymers were synthesized viapeptide formation process with subsequent co-encapsulation of therapeutic agentdocetaxel (DTX) and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to formthe multifunctional micelles. The micelles exhibited uniform nanosize andremarkable colloidal stability in aqueous solution. The sustained drug releasebehavior from HA micelles was observed over the test period. Moreover, thespecific targeting capability based on CD44 recptor-mediated endocytosis and the enhanced targeting efficacy by in presence of external magnetic field wereinvestigated. The clustered SPIONs within micelles exerted excellent contrasteffect with high r2 relaxivity in MR phantom test. Furthermore, themultifunctional micelles could readily convert light to heat to hyperthermiatemperature upon near infrared light irradition and induce photothermal ablation to breast cancer cells. The combined photothermal therapy with DTX-mediatedchemotherapy of the developed multifunctional polymeric micells could generate a synergistic therapeutic effect. Based on these findings, the resultingmultifunctional micelles may provide high potential for multimodality theragnosisof cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
