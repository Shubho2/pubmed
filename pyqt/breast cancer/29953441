Epigenetic mechanisms such as changes in DNA methylation may help to explain these protective effects. We assessed the impact of a one yearaerobic exercise intervention on DNA methylation biomarkers believed to play arole in carcinogenesis. The Alberta Physical Activity and Breast CancerPrevention (ALPHA) Trial was a two-armed randomized controlled trial in 320healthy, inactive, postmenopausal women with no history of cancer. In anancillary analysis, frozen blood samples (n = 256) were reassessed for levels of DNA methylation within LINE-1 and Alu repeats as well as within the promoterregions of APC, BRCA1, RASSF1, and hTERT genes. Differences between the exercise and control arm at 12-months, after adjusting for baseline values, were estimatedwithin an intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis using linear regression. Nosignificant differences in DNA methylation between the exercise and control arms were observed. In an exploratory analysis, we found that the prospective changein estimated VO2max was negatively associated with RASSF1 methylation in adose-response manner (p-trend = 0.04). A year-long aerobic exercise intervention does not affect LINE-1, Alu, APC, BRCA1, RASSF1, or hTERT methylation in healthy,inactive, postmenopausal women. Changes in DNA methylation within these genomicregions may not mediate the association between physical activity and cancer inhealthy postmenopausal women. Additional research is needed to validate ourfindings with RASSF1 methylation.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT00522262.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198641 PMCID: PMC6023230PMID: 29953441
