In this study, the antiproliferative activity of an O. elatus fraction extracted by ethyl acetate (EF) was tested on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells,human colon cancer HCT-116 cells, and human stomach cancer AGS cells. Thepotential mechanism of antiproliferation was also investigated using an apoptosisassay.RESULTS: The results showed that the EF remarkably suppressed proliferation ofhuman breast, stomach, and colon cancer cells. Further apoptosis tests by flowcytometry and immunoblot analyses showed the EF inhibited HCT-116 cellproliferation by inducing apoptosis. The bioassay-monitored fractionation of the EF resulted in the isolation of two polyacetylenes, falcarindiol (compound 1) andoplopandiol (compound 2), with falcarindiol possessing the strongestantiproliferative activity in colon cancer cells.CONCLUSION: Together, this study evaluated the anticancer activity of an O.elatus extract against human cancer cells, and provided the basis for furtherdevelopment of this herbal extract for the treatment of cancer.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1389201019666180515105447 PMID: 29766799
