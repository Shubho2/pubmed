Association of AR with cancer stem cell (CSC)markers in BCa is unknown. Aim of the present study was to evaluate theimmunohistochemical expression of AR, CD44, CD24 and ALDH1 in a cohort ofPakistani patients diagnosed with invasive BCa and to correlate the expressionwith 5- year disease free survival.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated immunohistochemical expression AR, CD44, CD24 and ALDH1 in formalin fixed paraffin embedded archival blocks of 166 cases ofprimary invasive BCa (stage I-III) and correlated the expression withclinicopathological variables and outcome using univariable and multivariableanalysis. Survival data was computed by Kaplan Meier curves.RESULTS: Expression of AR was observed in 62.7% tumors whereas CD44, CD24 andALDH1 were expressed in 61.4%, 44% and 30.1% tumors, respectively. AR expression was significantly associated with T1-T2 tumors, lower grade, estrogen andprogesterone receptor expression (P < .05) and remained an independent prognosticindicator in multivariable analysis (adjusted HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.81; P =.016). Significant association was observed between concordant expression of ARand CD24 (P = .001) with a favorable impact on survival (P = .007) whereasexpression of CSC phenotypes (CD44+, CD44+/CD24- and ALDH1+) did not correlatewith adverse outcome (P > .05). However, AR expression retained the associationwith better prognosis even in patients whose tumors exhibited a CSC phenotype.CONCLUSIONS: Expression of AR and CD24 in stage I-III invasive BCa correlateswith favorable clinicopathological features and delineates a subgroup of patientswith better disease-free survival.Copyright Â© 2018 BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE.
