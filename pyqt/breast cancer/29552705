However, little is known about factors associated with higher medical mistrust among Black breast cancer patients. We examinedpredictors of medical mistrust and relationships between medical mistrust,subscales of mistrust, and process of care factors to identify opportunities topromote positive healthcare interactions between the trustees (e.g., providers)and Black breast cancer patients, or the trustors. A secondary analysis wasconducted of survey data from 210 Black women with confirmed diagnosis ofinvasive breast cancer. Participants completed telephone surveys consisting ofquestions pertaining to sociodemographics, attitudes, and beliefs about medicalcare and breast cancer treatments. Multiple linear regression determined factors associated with medical mistrust and mistrust subscales. Most participants (61%) were over the age of 50 and currently single (64.8%). Women with greater medical mistrust reported less satisfaction with the trustee's technical ability(p < 0.0001) and greater satisfaction with their own propensity to access care(p < 0.05). Additionally, women with public insurance demonstrated greatermistrust (p < 0.01) and suspicion (p < 0.05) than women with private insurance,and women with less education reported greater perceived discrimination thanwomen who have at least a bachelor's degree. Findings from this study may inform future endeavors to educate providers on ways to effectively interact with andtreat Black breast cancer patients. Opportunities to develop interventions thataddress and tackle issues of mistrust as reported by Black patients maycontribute to ongoing efforts to reduce health disparities.DOI: 10.1007/s13187-018-1347-3 PMID: 29552705
