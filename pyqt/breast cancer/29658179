The variable expression levels of Aktisoforms with opposite effects on tumor growth and metastasis, however, make itdifficult to select the inhibitors to be used for specific breast tumor subtypes.Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrated here that Vav1, ectopicallyexpressed in invasive breast tumors derived cells, downmodulates Akt acting atexpression and/or activation levels depending on tumor subtype. The decreasedp-Akt1 (Ser473) levels are a common effect of Vav1 upmodulation, suggesting that,in breast tumor-derived cells and independently of their phenotype, Vav1interferes with signaling pathways ended to specifically recruit Akt1. Only inER-negative cell lines, the silencing of Vav1 induced the expression but not the activation of Akt2. A retrospective analysis of early invasive breast tumorsallowed to establish the prognostic significance of the p-Akt/Vav1 relationship. In particular, low Vav1 levels negatively influence the follow-up of patientswith low p-Akt in their primary tumors and subjected to adjuvant chemotherapy. Asthe use of specific or pan Akt inhibitors may not be sufficient or may even bedetrimental, increasing the levels of Vav1 could be a new approach to improvebreast cancer outcomes. This might be particularly relevant for tumors with atriple-negative phenotype, for which target-based therapies are not currentlyavailable.© 2018 The Authors.
