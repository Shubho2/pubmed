We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of eribulin forthe treatment of advanced or recurrent breast cancer in our hospital, consideringthe relative dose intensity(RDI), time to treatment failure (TTF), pretreatmentregimen number, and tumor subtype. Of the 36 patients who were treated witheribulin between December 2011 and August 2016, we studied 31 patients whoreceived eribulin as a single agent. The median RDI was 0.75 (range: 0.44-1). Theresponse rate was 22.5%, the disease control rate was 80.6%, and the clinicalbenefit rate was 45.2%. Overall survival(OS)was not associated with the RDI,previous regimen number, or tumor subtype; however, OS was affected by the TTF.Eribulin is a novel drug that has a different mechanism of action compared withthose of conventional anticancer drugs. Therefore, prolonging the duration oferibulin administration may be more important than maintaining the RDI.PMID: 30042274
