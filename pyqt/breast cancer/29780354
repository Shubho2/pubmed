In the BME, breast cancer cells severely alter the balanced bone formationand bone resorption driven by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The complex cellularcross talk in the BME is governed by secreted molecules, signaling pathways andepigenetic cues including non-coding RNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are smallnon-coding RNAs that reduce protein abundance and regulate several biologicalprocesses, including bone remodeling. Under pathological conditions, abnormalmiRNA signaling contributes to the progression of diseases, such as bonemetastasis. Recently miRNAs have been demonstrated to regulate several keydrivers of bone metastasis. Furthermore, miRNAs are implicated as importantregulators of cellular interactions within the metastatic BME. As a consequence, targeting the BME by miRNA delivery or antagonism has been reported to limitdisease progression in experimental and preclinical conditions positioning miRNAsas emerging novel therapeutic tools in metastatic bone disease. This review will summarize our current understanding on the composition and function of themetastatic BME and discuss the recent advances how miRNAs can modulatepathological interactions in the bone environment.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00202 PMCID: PMC5946017PMID: 29780354
