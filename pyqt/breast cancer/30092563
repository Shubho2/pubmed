[Epubahead of print]WBP2 Downregulation Inhibits Proliferation by Blocking YAP Transcription and the EGFR/PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway in Triple Negative Breast Cancer.Song H, Wu T, Xie D, Li D, Hua K, Hu J, Fang L.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dysregulated expression of WW domain-binding protein 2 (WBP2) isassociated with poor prognosis in ER+ breast cancer patients. However, its rolein triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been previously assessed.Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the functional mechanism of WBP2 in TNBC cells.METHODS: qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining were used toevaluate WBP2 expression in TNBC patient tumors and cell lines. HCC1937 andMDA-MB-231 cells transiently transfected with WBP2 small interfering RNA (siRNA),miR-613 mimics, or miR-613 inhibitors were subject to assays for cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. Co-immunoprecipitation, western blottingor qRT-PCR were employed to monitor changes in signaling pathway-related genesand proteins. Luciferase assays were performed to assess whether WBP2 is a directtarget of miR-613. The effect of miR-613 on tumor growth was assessed in vivousing mouse xenograft models.RESULTS: The expression of WBP2 was upregulated in TNBC tissues and cells.Expression of WBP2 was significantly correlated with Ki67 in TNBC patients.Knockdown of WBP2 inhibited cellular proliferation, promoted apoptosis, andinduced cell cycle arrest of TNBC cells. miR-613 directly bound to the3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of WBP2 and regulated the expression of WBP2.Moreover, miR-613 reduced the expression of WBP2 and suppressed tumor growth ofTNBC cells in vivo. Knockdown of WBP2 inhibited YAP transcription and theEGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in TNBC cells, and these effects were reversed byinhibition of miR-613.CONCLUSION: WBP2 overexpression is associated with the poor prognosis of TNBCpatients and the miR-613-WBP2 axis represses TNBC cell growth by inactivatingYAP-mediated gene expression and the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
