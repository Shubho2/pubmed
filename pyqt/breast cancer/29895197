The study is aimed to investigate cytotoxicityof SSCC on human breast cancer MCF-7 and BT-20 cells and exploreapoptosis-related mechanism in vitro. The MTT (3- [4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenylterazolium bromide) assay showed that SSCC exhibited significantlycytotoxic effects on MCF-7 and BT-20 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the effective inhibitory concentration was 100 μg/ml and 200 μg/ml,respectively. Apoptosis assay of these two kinds of cells was determined byHoechst 33,342/PI and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. The cell cycle assayshowed that SSCC triggered S and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells and S phase cell cycle arrest in BT-20 cells in a time-dependent manner. Furtherstudies demonstrated that SSCC led to the generation of reactive oxygen species(ROS) and the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in these twokinds of cells. N- acetyl-L cysteine (NAC), as a radical scavenger, significantlyinhibited the generation of ROS and decreased the apoptosis of MCF-7 and BT-20cells. Moreover, the expression of mitochondrial apoptosis-related proteins wasdetected by western blot assay. SSCC up-regulated the expression of Bax,down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, subsequently increased the release ofcytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm, and activated the cleavage ofcaspase-9 and -3, which finally induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and BT-20 cells invitro. Consequently, these data indicated that SSCC could induce apoptosis ofMCF-7and BT-20 cells in vitro by mitochondrial pathway.DOI: 10.1080/15384101.2018.1464845 PMID: 29895197
