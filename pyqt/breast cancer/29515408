Sheunderwent radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, and adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to the pelvis. Breast metastasis with a palpable mass then occurred 3 monthsafter the primary surgery. Simple mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy wereperformed. She initially showed a good response to the therapy, yet sheultimately died of multiple metastases with a fulminating disease course. This isan extremely rare case, and only 1 similar case has been reported earlier, so we report on this case along with a review of the relevant literature.DOI: 10.1159/000486194 PMCID: PMC5836239PMID: 29515408
