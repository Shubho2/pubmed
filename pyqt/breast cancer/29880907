Positivity threshold wasset at ≥ 1% staining. Lymphocytic infiltration, PD-L1expression, PIK3CAmutations, PTEN defects and BRCA1 promoter methylation were assessed.RESULTS: AR + /FOXA1 + tumours (42.4%) were more frequently: found in olderpatients, lobular, of lower nuclear grade, with more frequently PIK3CA mutations;exhibited less frequently BRCA1 promoter methylation, defects of PTEN and PD-L1expression than others. Recurrence-free and overall survivals were significantly lower for AR + /FOXA1 + TNBC (median follow-up: 7.8 years).CONCLUSIONS: AR + /FOXA1 + expression defines a luminal-like TNBC subgroupaffected with a worse outcome compared to other TNBC and a higher risk of laterecurrences. This subgroup appears enriched in PIK3CA mutations, suggesting arole for PI3K inhibitors in this subgroup.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0142-6 PMID: 29880907
