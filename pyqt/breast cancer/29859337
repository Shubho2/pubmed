Referringphysician, organisational factors, medical and socioeconomic characteristics for patients were analysed. Multivariate analysis was performed with regard to those factors. A telephone survey was conducted on a sample of referring physicianslocated outside GR (N = 142).RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2016, 8694 requests were received with 49% fromexternal physicians. Here, 4517 were male patients with a median age of 58[49-66] years (range 18-85). Tumour types were gastrointestinal (28%), lung(19%), breast (9%) and gynaecologic (8%). Mean enrolment rate was 37% (rangingfrom 24 to 45%). From 2008 to 2016, the enrolment rate decreases from 39% to 24%.In the meantime, DITEP trials portfolio evolves with the part of precisionmedicine trials increase from 12% to 40%. Factors that were significantlyassociated with a lower likelihood of being enrolled were referral from anexternal physician (OR 0.15 s.16-0.21]) compared to a physician from DITEP andyear of the request (2.74 [1.8-2.9] 2008 versus 2016). The enrolment rate and thenumber of patients addressed have a high variability regarding referringphysicians, which is little explained by characteristics as training, previousexperience or attitude regarding ECT.CONCLUSION: Beyond patients' individual characteristics, we show thatorganisational and professional factors have a major impact on likelihood ofenrolment in ECT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
