Unger, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.Background Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death among patientswith breast cancer. However, the association of cardiovascular-disease riskfactors (CVD-RFs) with long-term survival and cardiac events is not well studied.Methods We examined SWOG (formerly the Southwest Oncology Group) breast cancertrials from 1999 to 2011. We identified baseline diabetes, hypertension,hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease by linking trial records toMedicare claims. The primary outcome was overall survival. Patients with bothbaseline and follow-up claims were examined for cardiac events. Cox regressionwas used to assess the association between CVD-RFs and outcomes. Results Weidentified 1,460 participants older than 66 years of age from five trials; 842were eligible for survival outcomes analysis. At baseline, median age was 70years, and median follow-up was 6 years. Hypertension (73%) andhypercholesterolemia (57%) were the most prevalent conditions; 87% of patientshad one or more CVD-RF. There was no association between any of the individualCVD-RFs and overall survival except for hypercholesterolemia, which wasassociated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P = .01). With each additional CVD-RF, there was an increased risk ofdeath (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.40; P = .002), worse progression-free survival(HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.25; P = .05), and marginally worse cancer-freesurvival (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.34; P = .07). The relationship betweenbaseline CVD-RFs and cardiac events was analyzed in 736 patients. A strong linearassociation between the number of CVD-RFs and cardiac event was observed (HR per CVD-RF, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.69; P < .001). Conclusion Among participants inclinical trials, each additional baseline CVD-RF was associated with an increasedrisk of cardiac events and death. Efforts to improve control of modifiableCVD-RFs are needed, especially among those with multiple risk factors.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.77.4414 PMID: 29584550
