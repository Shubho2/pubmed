We examined a contemporary cohort of patients with primary TNBC bydetection and age at diagnosis within a population-based breast screening programto examine survival outcomes.PATIENTS AND METHODS: All women with a diagnosis of primary TNBC between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, in Nova Scotia, Canada, were included.Clinicopathologic and detection variables were abstracted from the Nova ScotiaBreast Screening Program. Patient charts were abstracted for adjuvant therapiesand survival outcomes, supplemented by provincial vital statistical data.RESULTS: A total of 412 patients comprised the study population, with almost halfaged over 60 years (46.3%) and 30.2% having screen-detected disease. There wereno significant differences in prognostic variables between age groups. Youngerpatients were more likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (96.3% ≤ 49 years vs. 31.2% ≥ 70 years), but there were no differences in disease-free or breastcancer-specific survival between the age groups. For those with diseaserecurrence, median time to recurrence and death was shorter for younger patients (17 vs. 26 months, 16 vs. 33 months respectively; age 40-49 vs. 70+). Those with screen-detected disease had better disease-free, breast cancer-specific, andoverall survival outcomes.CONCLUSION: Detection method may play a role in TNBC survival outcomes, thussupporting novel screening strategies for TNBC. Shorter time to survival eventsin the younger patient groups suggests that TNBC is a clinically heterogeneousdisease despite similarities in prognostic factors across age.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
