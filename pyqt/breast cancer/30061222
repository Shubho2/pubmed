The aim of this study wasto evaluate the accuracy of these prediction algorithms in the Israelipopulation.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Risk for developing breast cancer and the probability forcarrying BRCA1/2 mutations using BOADICEA, BRCAPRO, IBIS, MYRIAD and PENN2 modelswere computed for individuals counseled and genotyped at the Oncogenetics unit in2000 and 2005. The predicted mutation carriers and BC risks were compared withactual carrier rates by genotyping and BC diagnoses derived from the IsraeliNational Cancer Registry database.RESULTS: Overall, 65/648 (10%) study participants were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.Of 373 cancer-free participants at counseling, 25 had breast cancer by 2016.BOADICEA and BRCAPRO performed best for predicting BRCA mutation (AUC=0.741,0.738, respectively). No model was clinically useful in predicting breast cancer risk.CONCLUSION: BOADICEA and BRCAPRO outperformed the other tested algorithms in BRCAmutation prediction in Israeli women, but none was valuable in breast cancer riskprediction.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12760 PMID: 30061222  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
