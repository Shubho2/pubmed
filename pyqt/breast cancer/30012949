The role of transforminggrowth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in EMT is still debated. We used confocal laserscanning microscopy and scanning force spectroscopy to perform a morphomechanicalanalysis on epithelial breast cancer cells (MCF-7), comparing them before andafter TGF-β1 exogenous stimulation (5 ng/mL for 48 h). After TGF-β1 treatment,loss of cell⁻cell adherence (mainly due to the reduction of E-cadherin expressionof about 24%) and disaggregation of actin cortical fibers were observed intreated MCF-7. In addition, TGF-β1 induced an alteration of MCF-7 nucleimorphology as well as a decrease in the Young's modulus, owing to a rearrangementthat involved the cytoskeletal networks and the nuclear region. These relevantvariations in morphological features and mechanical properties, elicited byTGF-β1, suggested an increased capacity of MCF-7 to migrate, which was confirmed by a wound healing assay. By means of our biophysical approach, we highlightedthe malignant progression of breast cancer cells induced by TGF-β1 exposure. Weare confirming TGF-β1's role in EMT by means of morphomechanical evidence thatcould represent a turning point in understanding the molecular mechanismsinvolved in cancer progression.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10070234 PMCID: PMC6071091PMID: 30012949
