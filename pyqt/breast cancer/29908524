[Epub ahead ofprint]Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy: Changing the Treatment Sequence to Allow Immediate FreeAutologous Breast Reconstruction.Hughes K(1), Neoh D(1).Author information: (1)Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Austin Health, Melbourne,Australia.BACKGROUND: 窶キocally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is traditionally treated with a multimodal approach of chemotherapy, surgery, and postmastectomy radiotherapy(PMRT). The advantages of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) are welldescribed and include improved aesthetic outcomes, fewer surgical procedures,shorter treatment period, and a higher quality of life. However, this sequencemakes immediate free autologous reconstruction more challenging as PMRT can have deleterious and unpredictable effects on the flap. We have reversed thistreatment sequence with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, followed bymastectomy and immediate free autologous reconstruction. To our knowledge, thisis the first series to assess the outcomes of neoadjuvant radiotherapy onimmediate free microvascular breast reconstruction.METHODS: 窶ア review of patients with LABC who underwent immediate free autologous breast reconstruction post neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy between 2013 and 2017was conducted. All reconstructions were performed by a single reconstructiveteam. The primary end points were flap failure and surgical complications.Secondary end points were pathological response rate and disease recurrence.RESULTS: 窶ア total of 40 women with an average age of 48.1 (36-61) and averagebody mass index of 25.6 (18-37) were included. The most common choice of flap wasimmediate deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP, 31), followed by transverse or diagonal upper gracilis (5), muscle-sparing transversus abdominis (3), andstacked DIEP (1). Our major complication rate was 12.5% and minor complication15%. There were no cases of local recurrence and only three cases (7.5%) ofdistant disease progression.CONCLUSION: 窶ェrom our experience, this treatment sequence allows patients to havean immediate gold standard reconstruction without an increase in surgicalmorbidity. It affords the benefits of IBR without concern in delaying adjuvanttherapy and appears to be safe from an oncological perspective.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.DOI: 10.1055/s-0038-1660871 PMID: 29908524
