Multiple alternative mechanisms upon drug treatment are involved to offset therapeutic effects, eventually causing drugresistance or treatment failure.METHODS: Here, we optimized a computational method to discover novel drug target pathways in cancer subtypes using pathway cross-talk inhibition (PCI). The insilico method is based on the detection and quantification of the pathwaycross-talk for distinct cancer subtypes. From a BC data set of The Cancer Genome Atlas, we have identified different networks of cross-talking pathways fordifferent BC subtypes, validated using an independent BC dataset from GeneExpression Omnibus. Then, we predicted in silico the effects of new or approveddrugs on different BC subtypes by silencing individual or combinedsubtype-derived pathways with the aim to find new potential drugs or moreeffective synergistic combinations of drugs.RESULTS: Overall, we identified a set of new potential drug target pathways fordistinct BC subtypes on which therapeutic agents could synergically act showingantitumour effects and impacting on cross-talk inhibition.CONCLUSIONS: We believe that in silico methods based on PCI could offer valuable approaches to identifying more tailored and effective treatments in particular inheterogeneous cancer diseases.DOI: 10.1186/s12967-018-1535-2 PMCID: PMC5989433PMID: 29871693
