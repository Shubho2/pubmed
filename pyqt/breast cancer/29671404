Herceptin is a major drug used to treat HER2 positive breast cancer. Understanding the molecular events that occur when breastcancer cells are exposed to Herceptin is therefore of significant importance.Dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are central regulators of cell signallingthat function downstream of HER2, but their role in the cellular response toHerceptin is mostly unknown. This study aims to model the initial effects ofHerceptin exposure on DUSPs in HER2-positive breast cancer cells using Booleanmodelling.RESULTS: We experimentally measured expression time courses of 21 different DUSPsbetween 0 and 24Â h following Herceptin treatment of human MDA-MB-453HER2-positive breast cancer cells. We clustered these time courses into patterns of similar dynamics over time. In parallel, we built a series of Boolean modelsrepresenting the known regulatory mechanisms of DUSPs and then demonstrated that the dynamics predicted by the models is in agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, we used the models to predict regulatory mechanisms of DUSPs, where these mechanisms were partially known.CONCLUSIONS: Boolean modelling is a powerful technique to investigate andunderstand signalling pathways. We obtained an understanding of differentregulatory pathways in breast cancer and new insights on how these signallingpathways are activated. This method can be generalized to other drugs and longer time courses to better understand how resistance to drugs develops in cancercells over time.DOI: 10.1186/s12918-018-0534-5 PMCID: PMC5907139PMID: 29671404
