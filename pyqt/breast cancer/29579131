Early detection to improve breast cancer survival as wellas reducing risk factors remains the cornerstone of breast cancer controlaccording to the World Health Organization (WHO). This study aims to evaluate thecosts and outcomes of introducing a mammography screening program for Vietnamese women aged 45-64 years, compared to the current situation of no screening.METHODS: Decision analytical modeling using Markov chain analysis was used toestimate costs and health outcomes over a lifetime horizon. Model inputs werederived from published literature and the results were reported as incrementalcost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and/or incremental net monetary benefits(INMBs). One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses wereperformed to assess parameter uncertainty.RESULTS: The ICER per life year gained of the first round of mammographyscreening was US$3647.06 and US$4405.44 for women aged 50-54 years and 55-59years, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, mammography screeningin the 50-54 age group and the 55-59 age group were cost-effective in 100% ofcases at a threshold of three times the Vietnamese Gross Domestic Product (GDP)i.e., US$6332.70. However, less than 50% of the cases in the 60-64 age group and 0% of the cases in the 45-49 age group were cost effective at the WHO threshold. The ICERs were sensitive to the discount rate, mammography sensitivity, andtransition probability from remission to distant recurrence in stage II for allage groups.CONCLUSION: From the healthcare payer viewpoint, offering the first round ofmammography screening to Vietnamese women aged 50-59 years should be considered, with the given threshold of three times the Vietnamese GDP per capita.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194996 PMCID: PMC5868837PMID: 29579131  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
