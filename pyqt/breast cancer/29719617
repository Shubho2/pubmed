The expression of claudin3 was assessed in epithelial-derived tumorsusing Oncomine database. To determine the gene alteration during carcinogenesis, copy number alterations and mutations of claudin3 were evaluated using cBioPortaldatabase. Claudin3 is overexpressed in several tumors including gynecological,bladder, breast and prostate carcinomas. 38% of the 163 evaluated studies showmutations and/or amplification of claudin3. 3D reconstruction of tissue samplesfollowing immunofluorescence analysis clearly demonstrated that, unlike inhealthy tissues, claudin3 is mislocalized and unengaged in the formation of tightjunction in tumor samples. These data strongly support the evaluation ofunengaged claudin3 as a target for the development of novel diagnostic probes,optical approaches for real time detection of tumoral tissues during surgery, andtarget therapeutic drugs.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24858 PMCID: PMC5915084PMID: 29719617
