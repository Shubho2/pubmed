Sequential seeding of different cell lines and the spatialdisplacement of the magnet array creates co-cultured cellular structures within awell without using physically intrusive well inserts. Both monotypic andco-culture experiments produce morphologically rich 3D cell structures that areotherwise absent in regular monolayer cell cultures. The magnetic contactlessbioprinting of cells provides further insight into cell behaviour, invasionstrategies and transformations that are useful for potential applications in drugscreening, 3D cell culture formation and tissue engineering.DOI: 10.1039/c7bm01050h PMID: 29445812
