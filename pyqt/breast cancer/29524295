Recently, results from our laboratory have shown that MICAL1 modulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the latter thenactivates phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signallingpathway which regulates breast cancer cell invasion. Herein, we performed thisstudy to assess the involvement of MICAL1 in breast cancer cell proliferation andto explore the potential molecular mechanism. We noticed that depletion of MICAL1markedly reduced cell proliferation in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and T47D.This effect of MICAL1 on proliferation was independent of wnt/β-catenin and NF-κBpathways. Interestingly, depletion of MICAL1 significantly inhibited ROSproduction, decreased p-ERK expression and unfavourable for proliferativephenotype of breast cancer cells. Likewise, MICAL1 overexpression increased p-ERKlevel as well as p-ERK nucleus translocation. Moreover, we investigated theeffect of MICAL1 on cell cycle-related proteins. MICAL1 positively regulated CDK4and cyclin D expression, but not CDK2, CDK6, cyclin A and cyclin E. In addition, more expression of CDK4 and cyclin D by MICAL1 overexpression was blocked byPI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. LY294002 treatment also attenuated the increase inthe p-ERK level in MICAL1-overexpressed breast cancer cells. Together, ourresults suggest that MICAL1 exhibits its effect on proliferation via maintaining cyclin D expression through ROS-sensitive PI3K/Akt/ERK signalling in breastcancer cells.© 2018 The Authors.
