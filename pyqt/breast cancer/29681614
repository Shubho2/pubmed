The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence andspectrum of BRCA1/2 mutations in China. MATERIAL AND METHODS In total, 595 breastcancer patients in China were screened with an amplicon-based panel for thedetection of BRCA1/2 mutations in coding regions using next-generation sequencing(NGS) with a Personal Genome Machine. Every pathogenic mutation detected wasconfirmed by Sanger sequencing. The disease-causing potential of variants ofuncertain significance (VUS) was predicted using PolyPhen-2, SIFT, PhyloP, andGrantham. RESULTS The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations was 8.07% in the Chinesepopulation. Forty-two pathogenic mutations were identified in 48 cases (17 BRCA1 cases and 31 BRCA2 cases), including 19 novel mutations. Nine VUS were predicted to be deleterious by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT and subsequently predicted by PhyloP andGrantham for the evolutionary conservation. CONCLUSIONS These results suggestthat NGS is useful as a rapid, high-throughput, and cost-effective screening toolfor the analysis of BRCA1/2 mutations. Based on this panel, we found that BRCA1/2germline mutations in China exhibit distinct characteristics compared to those inWestern populations.PMCID: PMC5936051PMID: 29681614
