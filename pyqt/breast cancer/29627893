A tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has a crucial role in manycardiovascular diseases and it is related to many processes such as angiogenesis in cancer cells. Therefore, sensitive determination of tPA is important indiagnosis and clinical research. tPA monoclonal antibody was covalently attached onto single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using diimide-activated imidationcoupling. Functionalized SWCNTs were immobilized onto a glassy carbon electrodeand the modification process was investigated by sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), SEM, cyclic voltammetry(CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Cyclic voltammograms(CVs) in a scan rate of 100 mVs-1 was studied and comparisons were made betweenthe modified glassy carbon electrodes (immobilized with antibodies) as a working electrode before and after the formation of tPA-antibody complex. Results of the SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the antibody was covalently and site directly attachedto the SWCNTs. The fabricated biosensor provided a good linear response rangefrom 0.1 to 1.0 ng mL-1 with a low detection limit of 0.026 ng mL-1. Theimmunosensor showed selectivity, reproducibility, good sensitivity, andacceptable stability. Satisfactory results were observed for early and sensitive determination of tPA in human serum samples. For the first time, such specificbiosensor is currently being fabricated for tPA in our laboratories andsuccessfully could determine tPA in myocardial infraction and breast cancerpatients.
