Most imaging studies focused on microscopic imaging. Their potential as optical imaging probes for whole body small animal imaging hasrarely been explored. Taking advantage of their surface plasmon resonance (SPR)properties, we aim to develop a noninvasive diffuse optical imaging method to mapthe distribution of a special type of GNP, gold nanorods (GNR), in small animals.We developed an integrated dual-modality imaging system capable of both x-raycomputed tomography (XCT) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT). XCT provides the animal anatomy and contour required for DOT; DOT maps the distribution of GNR in the animal. This SPR enhanced optical imaging (SPROI) technique was investigated using simulation, phantom and mouse experiments. The distribution of GNR atvarious concentrations (0.1-100 nM, or 3.5 ug/g-3.5 mg/g) was successfullyreconstructed from centimeter-scaled volumes. SPROI detected GNR at 18 μg/gconcentration in the mouse breast tumor, and is 3 orders more sensitive thanx-ray imaging. This study demonstrated the high sensitivity of SPROI in mappingGNR distributions in small animals. It does not require additional imaging tagsother than GNR themselves. SPROI can be used to detect tumors targeted by GNR viapassive targeting based on enhanced permeability and retention or via activetargeting using biologically conjugated ligands.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27624-6 PMCID: PMC6008467PMID: 29921960
