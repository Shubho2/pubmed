[Epubahead of print]Measuring the Impact of an Adolescent and Young Adult Program on AddressingPatient Care Needs.Mitchell L(1), Tam S(1), Lewin J(2), Srikanthan A(3), Heck C(4), Hodgson D(5),Vakeesan B(1), Sim HW(2), Gupta A(1)(2)(6).Author information: (1)1 Adolescent and Young Adult Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center ,Toronto, Canada .(2)2 Division of Medical Oncology, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University ofToronto , Toronto, Canada .(3)3 Division of Medical Oncology, BC Cancer Agency , Vancouver, Canada .(4)4 Department of Practice Based Research and Innovation, University HealthNetwork , Toronto, Canada .(5)5 Radiation Medicine Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center , Toronto,Canada .(6)6 Division of Haematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto , Toronto, Canada .PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an adult-based adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer program by assessing patient satisfaction and whetherprogramming offers added incremental benefit beyond primary oncology providers(POP) to address their needs.METHODS: A modified validated survey was used to ask two questions: (1) rate on a10-point Likert scale their level of satisfaction with the information providedto them by their POP and (2) did the AYA consult provide added value on top oftheir POP. Young people at PM were recruited over two separate time points spaced1 year apart. Descriptive statistics was used to report demographics and surveyresponses. Differences in demographics between cohorts 1 and 2 were comparedusing Student's t-tests.RESULTS: Participants were an average of 31 years (range 15-39) of age; (Cohort1 = 137; Cohort 2 = 130) and were dominated by diagnoses of leukemia, lymphoma,and breast cancer. More patients had a consultation with the AYA program in 2016 (Cohort 2 = 55/130, 42%) compared to 2015 (Cohort 1 = 34/137, 25%, p = 0.026).Mean satisfaction scores (±SD) with information provided by POP in AYA domains inboth cohorts combined were highest among (1) cancer information (8.09 ± 2.22),(2) social supports (7.45 ± 2.52), and (3) school/work (7.42 ± 2.88). Whenevaluating the incremental benefit of the AYA-dedicated team, statisticallysignificant added value was perceived in 5/10 domains, including school/work(p < 0.001), social supports (p < 0.001), physical appearance (p = 0.009), sexualhealth (p = 0.01), and fertility (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Participants were satisfied with the information provided by theirPOP and still declared incremental added benefit of the AYA program. Cancercenters should continue to advocate for AYA focused programming with ongoingevaluation.DOI: 10.1089/jayao.2018.0015 PMID: 29985734
