China.Aim: Accumulated evidence has suggested a relationship between S100A4 proteinexpression and the development and progression of pancreatic cancer (PC) whileits role in diagnosis and prognosis of PC still keeps inconsistent. To obtaindefinitive associations between S100A4 and PC, a meta-analysis was conducted.Materials and Methods: The PubMed and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructuredatabases were electronically searched to identify studies reporting anassociation between S100A4 protein and PC. Statistical analyses were undergonewith the utilization of STATA version 12.0 software.Results: Nine clinical studies with a total of 545 tumor samples were included inthe meta-analysis. Results revealed that increased S100A4 expression wereassociated with the tumor-node-metastasis stages of PC (III-IV vs. I-II: oddsratio [OR] =5.50, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] =3.13-9.67, P < 0.001). Also, compared with 1-2 histologic grade of PC samples, S100A4 protein was expressedmore frequently in samples with 3-4 histologic grade (grades 1-2 vs. grades 3-4: OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.05-6.24, P = 0.038).Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that overexpression of S100A4 seems to beassociated with tumor progression and poor prognosis of PC patients.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.172582 PMID: 29578167
