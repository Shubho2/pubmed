Time toprogression/progression-free survival was the primary outcome, while overallsurvival and safety were the secondary outcomes. Time toprogression/progression-free survival was evaluated in subgroups determined onage, hormone receptor status, visceral metastasis, and measurable disease. Hazardratios with 95% confidence intervals were analyzed by STATA 12.0.RESULTS: Total of seven randomized controlled trials, with 3168 patients wereincluded for analysis. In the overall population, fulvestrant and aromataseinhibitors had similar time to progression/progression-free survival (Hazardratio 0.93; 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.01, P = 0.102); however, time toprogression/progression-free survival for fulvestrant 500 mg was significantlylonger compared with aromatase inhibitors (hazard ratio 0.75; 95% confidenceinterval 0.62-0.91, P = 0.003). Subgroup analysis revealed significantprolongation of time to progression/progression-free survival with fulvestrantcompared with aromatase inhibitors in the patients of estrogen and progesteronereceptor-positive (hazard ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.98,P = 0.022) and patients aged ≥ 65 years (hazard ratio 0.81; 95% confidenceinterval 0.68-0.96, P = 0.014). Overall survival was similar in both groups(hazard ratio 0.89; 95% confidence interval 0.70, 1.13, P = 0.334).CONCLUSION: In postmenopausal women with estrogen and/or progesteronereceptor-positive advanced breast cancer, fulvestrant 500 mg showed betterefficacy than aromatase inhibitor, which was not seen with fulvestrant 250 mg.Compared to aromatase inhibitors, fulvestrant prolonged time toprogression/progression-free survival in the subgroups including estrogen andprogesterone receptor-positive patients and those aged ≥ 65 years.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4867-y PMID: 29974356
