In this study, thesenanocapsules showed a similar antitumour effect in comparison to the freedoxorubicin (DOX) treatment, but showed no evident DOX-related cardiotoxicity, asevidenced by serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) activity. The histopathologicalanalysis showed that the free DOX treatment induced more intense morphologicaldamage to myocardial tissues in comparison to NCS-DOX treatment. Animals treated with free DOX presented important muscle fibre degradation and animals treatedwith NCS-DOX, heart tissue did not present signals of muscle fibre degeneration. These results indicate that the cardiotoxicity related to DOX is reduced whenthis drug is carried by the NCS-DOX. Noteworthy, biodistribution analyses showed that NCS-DOX accumulated more intensely in tumours than the free DOX. Thus, this study reinforces the importance of the development of nanocapsules as drugcarriers for the treatment of cancer.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1478423 PMID: 29842818
