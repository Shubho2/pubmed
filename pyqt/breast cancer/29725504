In this study, we developed apan-cancer metastasis potential score (panMPS) based on observed CNAs. panMPSpredicts metastasis and metastasis-free survival in cohorts of patients withprostate cancer, triple negative breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, andoverall survival in the Metabric breast cancer cohort and three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), including prostate, breast and lung adenocarcinoma.These CNAs are present in cell lines of metastatic tumors from eight differentorigins, reflected by an elevated panMPS for all cell lines. Many copy numberalterations involve large chromosomal segments that encompass multiple genes("clumps"). We show that harnessing this structural information to select onlyone gene per clump captures the contributions of other genes within the clump,resulting in a robust predictor of metastasis outcome. These sets of selectedgenes are distinct from cancer drivers that undergo mutation, and in fact,metastasis-related functions have been published for over half of them.DOI: 10.18632/genesandcancer.165 PMCID: PMC5931251PMID: 29725504
