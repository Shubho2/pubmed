This article will reviewthe literature concerning the use of checkpoint inhibitors in breast cancer.RECENT FINDINGS: The histological subtype of BC with the strongest signal ofefficacy has been triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Early trials ofsingle-agent checkpoint inhibitors did not demonstrate a uniformly positivesignal. Clinical studies suggest response rates between 5 and 10% in pretreatedpatients and roughly 20-25% for untreated advanced TNBC. However, in the smallsubset of patients who do respond, the response is often durable. Moreencouraging results have been reported with their use in combination withchemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. Larger phase III studies are underway toconfirm these earlier findings. An immune-directed therapeutic approach for themanagement of BC is underway, and it is likely that combination therapy will berequired to achieve a level of efficacy worthy of use in the BC treatmentparadigm. These agents are not without both economic and clinical toxicity;therefore, it is imperative that we identify patients most likely to benefit fromthese therapies through well-designed biologically plausible clinical studies andby evaluating novel combinatorial approaches with informative biomarker drivencorrelative studies.DOI: 10.1007/s11912-018-0701-2 PMID: 29713831
