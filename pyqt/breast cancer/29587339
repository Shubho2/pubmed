Many patients with TNBC have a lower survival rate than patients with other types due to a poorprognosis. In this study, we confirmed the anti-cancer effect of a naturalcompound, Gomisin G, in TNBC cancer cells. Treatment with Gomisin G suppressedthe viability of two TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 but not non-TNBC cell lines such as MCF-7, T47D, and ZR75-1. To investigate the molecularmechanism of this activity, we examined the signal transduction pathways aftertreatment with Gomisin G in MDA-MB-231 cells. Gomisin G did not induce apoptosis but drastically inhibited AKT phosphorylation and reduced the amount ofretinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) and phosphorylated Rb. Gomisin Ginduced in a proteasome-dependent manner a decrease in Cyclin D1. Consequently,Gomisin G causes cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. In contrast, there was nosignificant change in T47D cells except for a mild decrease in AKTphosphorylation. These results show that Gomisin G has an anti-cancer activity bysuppressing proliferation rather than inducing apoptosis in TNBC cells. Our studysuggests that Gomisin G could be used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of TNBC patients.DOI: 10.4062/biomolther.2017.235 PMCID: PMC5933900PMID: 29587339
