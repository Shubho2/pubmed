In our study, we aimed to characterize the prevalence of cancerdiagnoses among U.S. cabin crew relative to the general population.METHODS: In 2014-2015, we surveyed participants of the Harvard Flight AttendantHealth Study. We compared the prevalence of their self-reported cancer diagnoses to a contemporaneous cohort in the National Health and Nutrition ExaminationSurvey (NHANES 2013-2014) using age-weighted standardized prevalence ratios(SPRs). We also analyzed associations between job tenure and the prevalence ofselected cancers, using logistic regression and adjusting for potentialconfounders.RESULTS: Compared to NHANES participants with a similar socioeconomic status(n = 2729), flight attendants (n = 5366) had a higher prevalence of every cancer we examined, especially breast cancer, melanoma, and non-melanoma skin canceramong females. SPR for these conditions were 1.51 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.24), 2.27 (95%CI: 1.27, 4.06), and 4.09 (95% CI: 2.70, 6.20), respectively. Job tenure waspositively related to non-melanoma skin cancer among females, with borderlineassociations for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers among males. Consistentwith previous studies, we observed associations between job tenure and breastcancer among women who had three or more children.CONCLUSIONS: We observed higher rates of specific cancers in flight attendantscompared the general population, some of which were related to job tenure. Ourresults should be interpreted in light of self-reported health information and a cross-sectional study design. Future longitudinal studies should evaluateassociations between specific exposures and cancers among cabin crew.DOI: 10.1186/s12940-018-0396-8 PMCID: PMC6019786PMID: 29940975
