Recently, some naturallyoccurring compounds, such as resveratrol, have been shown to regulate microRNA(miRNA) expression in a positive manner; this regulatory activity is likely to beadvantageous for cancer prevention and treatment. Resveratrol, a multi-functionalpolyphenolic phytoalexin, has been known to exert anti-tumorigenic andanti-inflammatory effects and to regulate miRNA expression. However, ourunderstanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms whereby resveratrol controlscancer cell growth via the regulation of miRNA and oncogenic target geneexpression to inhibit disease progression remains incomplete. Here we show thatresveratrol controls breast cancer cell proliferation by inducingtumor-suppressive miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-424, and miR-503) via the p53 pathway and then by suppressing heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1), whichis associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Notably, HNRNPA1 wasdirectly regulated by miR-424 and miR-503, the expression of which were mediated by resveratrol. Moreover, we found that resveratrol exerts broad effects on theHNRNPA1-related pre-mRNA splicing pathway. Our data provide novel insights intothe regulatory roles of resveratrol for preventing and treating of diseases.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25339 PMCID: PMC5973863PMID: 29872500
