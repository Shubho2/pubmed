However, many registriesdo not attain desirable capture rates or lack sufficient funding, potentiallyleading to premature termination. This study aims to provide information aboutrarely discussed, yet pivotal topics regarding the long-term survival of implant registries, focusing on costs, funding models, and the role of stakeholders.METHODS: Worldwide, relatively recently developed breast device (BD) registrieswere compared to long-standing, orthopaedic (OD) and cardiovascular device (CD)registries. A standardised questionnaire was sent to the registries' designatedrepresentatives with key positions, discussing start-up costs, costs ofmaintenance, value of investment, governance, stakeholders, funding, andsustainability.RESULTS: Thirteen registries were included, originating from nine countries(seven BD registries, five OD registries, one CD registry). In general, start-up costs were comparable, and younger registries were more expensive to maintain.Numerous stakeholders showed interest in registry outcomes. However, only 50% of the registries reported a sustainable funding structure.CONCLUSION: This study provides a global perspective on implantable deviceregistries. All registries provided important information, serving three uniquepurposes by evaluating the quality of healthcare provided, the quality of allregistered devices, and processing recall information. Yet, only half of theregistries were certain of sustainable funding, and thus their future existence. It is of utmost importance to bring this to the attention of all partiesinvolved.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bjps.2018.05.048 PMID: 29945828
