Both genes function in the homologous recombination (HR) pathwayof the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair process. Therefore, the DNA-repairdefect characteristic of cancer cells brings about a therapeutic advantage forpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor-induced synthetic lethality. PARPinhibitor-based therapeutics initially cause cancer lethality but acquiredresistance mechanisms have been found and need to be elucidated. In particular,it is essential to understand in detail the mechanism of DNA damage and repair toPARP inhibitor treatment. Further investigations have shown the roles of BRCA1/2 and its associations to other molecules in the DSB repair system. Notably, therepair pathway chosen in BRCA1-deficient cells could be entirely different fromthat in BRCA2-deficient cells after PARP inhibitor treatment. The present review describes synthetic lethality and acquired resistance mechanisms to PARPinhibitor through the DSB repair pathway and subsequent repair process. Inaddition, recent knowledge of resistance mechanisms is discussed. Our modelshould contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.Â© 2018 The Authors.
