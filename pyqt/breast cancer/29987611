We soughtto characterize perceptions and practices of surgical oncologists regarding theperioperative care of obese patients being treated for cancer.METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was designed, pilot tested, and utilized toassess perceptions and practices of surgeons treating cancer patients. Surgicaloncologists were identified using a commercially available database, andQualtrics® was used to distribute and manage the survey. Statistical analyseswere completed by using SPSS.RESULTS: Of the 1731 electronic invitations, 172 recipients initiated the survey,and 157 submitted responses (91.2%). Many surgeons (65.7%) believed that obesepatients are more likely to present with more advanced cancers and were morelikely than system factors to explain this delayed treatment [t(87) = 4.84;p < 0.001]. Nearly two-thirds of providers (64.5%) reported that obesity had noimpact on the timing of surgery; however, one-third of respondents (34.2%) weremore likely to recommend preoperative nonsurgical therapy rather than upfrontsurgery among obese patients. For operations of the chest/abdomen and breast/softtissue, surgeons perceived obesity to be more related to risk of postoperativethan intraoperative complications (chest/abdomen mean 4.13 vs. 3.26; breast/soft tissue 4.11 vs. 2.60; p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: One in three surgeons reported that patient obesity would change thetiming/sequence of when resection would be offered. Many surgeons perceived that obesity was related to a wide array of intra- and postoperative adverse outcomes.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6564-9 PMID: 29987611
