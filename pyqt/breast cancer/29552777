Histopathology and immunohistochemistry canhelp in the identification of the primary site. Parotidectomy with completeexcision of the parotid lesion may have diagnostic and/or loco-regional controland/or curative intent, however there is still no international consensus aboutthe therapy of parotid malignant metastasis.PMID: 29552777
