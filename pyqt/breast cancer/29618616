Blood from 656 of 852 patients (77%) was processed with ApoStreamto enrich for CTCs. A multiplex immunofluorescence assay measured expression ofcandidate response biomarkers [topoisomerase 1 (Top1), topoisomerase 2 (Top2),Ki67, RAD51, ABCG2, γH2AX, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediateddUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)] in CTCs. Patients were classified as Top1 low(Top1Lo) or Top1 high (Top1Hi) based on median CTC Top1 expression. Correlationof CTC biomarker expression at baseline, cycle 2 day 1 (C2D1), and cycle 4 day 1 with overall survival (OS) was investigated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meieranalyses.Results: Overall, 98% of samples were successfully processed, of which97% had detectable CTCs (median, 47-63 CTCs/mL; range, 0-2,020 CTCs/mL). Top1,Top2, and TUNEL expression was detected in 52% to 90% of samples; no significant associations with OS were observed in pretreatment samples for either group.EP-treated patients with low C2D1Top1+ CTCs had improved OS compared with thosewith higher positivity (14.1 months vs. 11.0 months, respectively; HR, 0.7; P =0.02); this difference was not seen in TPC-treated patients (HR, 1.12; P = 0.48).Patients whose CTCs decreased from Top1Hi to Top1Lo at C2D1 had the greatest OSbenefit from EP (HR, 0.57; P = 0.01).Conclusions: CTC Top1 expression followingEP treatment may identify patients with MBC most likely to have an OS benefit.Clin Cancer Res; 24(14); 3348-57. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-3059 PMID: 29618616
