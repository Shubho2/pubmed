Here, we haveaddressed the protumorigenic impact of different NRG domains. To do this,deletion mutants affecting different NRG domains were expressed in 293 and MCF7cells. Of the five forms studied, only the wild-type and a mutant lacking theIg-like domain (NRGΔIg ) were properly sorted to the plasma membrane. Both forms were released as soluble forms to the culture media. However, the mutant NRGΔIgfailed to efficiently activate HER2 and HER3 receptors, signaling pathways, andcell proliferation when compared to wild-type NRG. Treatment with trastuzumab, a humanized antibody used in the breast cancer clinic, inhibited the constitutiveactivation of HER2, HER3, and downstream signaling in MCF7 cells constitutivelyexpressing wild-type NRG. In contrast, this treatment had a marginal effect onMCF7-NRGΔIg cells. This study demonstrates that the Ig-like region of NRGs exertsan important role in their capability to activate ErbB/HER receptors andmitogenic responses. Strategies aimed at targeting NRGs should consider that factto improve neutralization of the pro-oncogenic properties of NRGs.© 2018 The Authors.
