Regional anesthesia can reduce the stress response associated with surgicaltrauma.OBJECTIVES: Our aim is to explore the efficacy of 1 µg/kg dexmedetomedine addedto an ultrasound (US)-modified pectoral (Pecs) block on postoperative pain andstress response in patients undergoing MRM.STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, prospective study.SETTING: An academic medical center.METHODS: Sixty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physicalstatus I-II (18-60 years old and weighing 50-90 kg) scheduled for MRM wereenrolled and randomly assigned into 2 groups (30 in each) to receive apreoperative US Pecs block with 30 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine only (group 1,bupivacaine group [GB]) or 30 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine plus 1 µg/kgdexmedetomidine (group II, dexmedetomidine group [GD]). The patients werefollowed-up 48 hours postoperatively for vital signs (heart rate [HR],noninvasive blood pressure [NIBP], respiratory rate [RR], and oxygen saturation[Sao2]), visual analog scale (VAS) scores, time to first request of rescueanalgesia, total morphine consumption, and side effects. Serum levels of cortisoland prolactin were assessed at baseline and at 1 and 24 hours postoperatively.RESULTS: A significant reduction in the intraoperative HR, systolic bloodpressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) starting at 30 minutes until120 minutes in the GD group compared to the GB group (P < 0.05) was observed. TheVAS scores showed a statistically significant reduction in the GD group compared to the GB group, which started immediately up until 12 hours postoperatively (P <0.05). There was a delayed time to first request of analgesia in the GD group(25.4 ± 16.4 hrs) compared to the GB group (17 ± 12 hrs) (P = 0.029), and therewas a significant decrease of the total amount of morphine consumption in the GD group (9 + 3.6 mg) compared to the GB group (12 + 3.6 mg) (P = 0.001). There was a significant reduction in the mean serum cortisol and prolactin levels at 1 and 24 hours postoperative in the GD patients compared to the GB patients (P < 0.05).LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by its sample size.CONCLUSION: The addition of 1 µg/kg dexmedetomidine to an US-modified Pecs block has superior analgesia and more attenuation to stress hormone levels withoutserious side effects, compared to a regular Pecs block in patients who underwent MRM.KEY WORDS: Postoperative pain, dexmedetomidine, Pecs block, stress response,breast surgery.PMID: 29565951
