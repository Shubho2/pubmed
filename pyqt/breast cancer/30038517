It has beendetected in many malignancies. But the relation between SYNPO2 and breast cancer (BC) is unclear.Materials and methods: In this study, we explored the expression and function of SYNPO2 in BC. We found that SYNPO2 gene in BC was downregulated at thetranscriptional level in both validated and TCGA cohorts.Results: The results revealed that age, lymph node metastasis, and clinical stagein the validated cohort were related to the expression of SYNPO2 negatively.Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with lower SYNPO2 expression had aworse overall survival.Discussion: We found that migration and invasion were promoted after knockingdown SYNPO2 in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-468. Meanwhile, knockdown ofSYNPO2 could enhance PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which may induce migration and invasion. Our findings reveal that SYNPO2 was associated with BC.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S162670 PMCID: PMC6051747PMID: 30038517
