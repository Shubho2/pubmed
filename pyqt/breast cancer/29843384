Many observers often do not appreciate the complex and differing aspects of alcohol's effects inpathophysiologies that have been reported in multiple organs. Chronic alcoholabuse is known to be associated with pathophysiological changes that often resultin life-threatening clinical outcomes, e.g., breast and colon cancer, pancreatic disease, cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, osteoporosis, arthritis, kidneydisease, immune system dysfunction, hypertension, coronary artery disease,cardiomyopathy, and can be as far-reaching as to cause central nervous systemdisorders. In this review article, we will discuss the various organs impacted byalcohol abuse. The lack of clear guidelines on the amount and frequency ofalcohol intake, complicated by personal demographics, make extrapolations toreal-life practices at best difficult for public health policy-makers.DOI: 10.3390/ijerph15061083 PMCID: PMC6028910PMID: 29843384
