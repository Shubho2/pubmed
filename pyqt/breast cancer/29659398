Mixed epithelial and stromal tumor ofthe kidney has no pathognomonic imaging feature. It is difficult to distinguishMESTK from other cystic renal neoplasms using current radiological methods. Wereport a rare case of MESTK that was diagnosed in a 46-year-old woman with breastcancer. F-FDG PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT features of MESTK are presented,which could potentially provide useful information in the differential diagnoses of cystic renal neoplasms.DOI: 10.1097/RLU.0000000000002109 PMID: 29659398
