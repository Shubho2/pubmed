Epub 2018 May 7.A multicenter phase II trial of neoadjuvant letrozole plus low-dosecyclophosphamide in postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor-positivebreast cancer (JBCRG-07): therapeutic efficacy and clinical implications ofcirculating endothelial cells.Ueno T(1)(2), Masuda N(3), Kamigaki S(4), Morimoto T(5), Akiyama F(6), KurosumiM(7), Tsuda H(8), Mikami Y(9), Tanaka S(10), Morita S(11), Toi M(10).Author information: (1)Breast Surgical Oncology, Breast Oncology Center, Cancer Institute Hospital,Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.(2)Department of Breast Surgery, School of Medicine, Kyorin University, Tokyo,Japan.(3)National Hospital Organization, Osaka National Hospital, Osaka, Japan.(4)Sakai Municipal Hospital, Osaka, Japan.(5)Yao Municipal Hospital, Osaka, Japan.(6)Department of Pathology, The Cancer Institute of Japanese Foundation forCancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.(7)Department of Pathology, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama, Japan.(8)Department of Basic Pathology, National Defense Medical College, Saitama,Japan.(9)Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kumamoto University Hospital, Kumamoto,Japan.(10)Department of Breast Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty ofMedicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.(11)Department of Biomedical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Graduate School ofMedicine and Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy has been reported to decrease tumor size, whichleads to increased breast conservation rates. To improve the clinical response,metronomic chemotherapy with endocrine therapy is a promising strategy. Amulticenter phase II single-arm neoadjuvant trial with letrozole andcyclophosphamide was conducted. Eligibility criteria included postmenopausalstatus, T2-4 N0-1, and estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma. Letrozole(2.5 mg) plus cyclophosphamide (50 mg) was given orally once a day for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the clinical response rate (CRR). To investigateanti-angiogenic effects, circulating endothelial cells (CECs) were quantifiedusing the CellSearch system. From October 2007 to March 2010, 41 patients wereenrolled. The CRR was 67.5% (52.0-80.0%), which was above the prespecifiedthreshold (65%). The conversion rate from total mastectomy to breast-conservingsurgery was 64% (18/28). Grade 3 or greater nonhematological toxicity was notreported. Clinical response was associated with improved disease-free survival(DFS) (P = 0.020). The increase in CEC counts at 8 weeks was observed innonresponders (P = 0.004) but not in responders. Patients with higher CEC counts at baseline or post-treatment showed worse DFS than those with lower counts(P < 0.001 at baseline and = 0.014 post-treatment). Multivariate analysis showed that post-treatment CEC counts but not pretreatment counts were independentlycorrelated with DFS (P = 0.046). In conclusion, neoadjuvant letrozole pluscyclophosphamide showed a good clinical response for postmenopausal patients withestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. CEC quantification is a promising tool for treatment monitoring and prognostic stratification for metronomic therapyfollowing validation of our results in larger studies.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATIONNUMBER: UMIN000001331 Phase II study of neoadjuvant letrozole combined withlow-dose metronomic cyclophosphamide for postmenopausal women withendocrine-responsive breast cancer (JBCRG-07).© 2018 The Authors.
