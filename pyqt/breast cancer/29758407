Their aromataseinhibitory activities have been evaluated. Interestingly, eight thioureaderivatives (4e, 5f-h, 6d, 6f-h) exhibited the aromatase inhibitory activitieswith IC50 range of 0.6-10.2 μM. The meta-bisthiourea bearing 4-NO2 group (6f) and3,5-diCF3 groups (6h) were shown to be the most potent compounds withsub-micromolar IC50 values of 0.8 and 0.6 μM, respectively. Molecular dockingalso revealed that one of the thiourea moieties of these two compounds couldmimic steroidal backbone of the natural androstenedione (ASD) via hydrophobicinteractions with enzyme residues (Val370, Leu477, Thr310, and Phe221 for 6f,Val370, Leu477, Ser478, and Ile133 for 6h). This is the first time that thebisthioureas have been reported for their potential to be developed as aromatase inhibitors, in which the 4-NO2 and 3,5-diCF3 analogs have been highlighted aspromising candidates.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
