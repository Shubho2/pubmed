Weaimed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, andpreliminary activity of tucatinib in combination with capecitabine or trastuzumabin patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with or without brain metastases.METHODS: In this non-randomised, open-label, phase 1b trial done in five sites inthe USA, we recruited patients aged 18 years or older with HER2-positiveprogressive breast cancer who had been previously treated with trastuzumab,pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine. Eligible patients required HER2-positivityassessed locally, evaluable lesions as defined per Response Evaluation Criteriain Solid Tumors, version 1.1, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Groupperformance status of 0 or 1. Tucatinib was administered twice a day inconjunction with capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 orally twice a day for 14 days of a21-day cycle, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg intravenously once every 21 days, or both. Amodified 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was used to determine the recommended phase2 dose, starting with tucatinib in combination with capecitabine or trastuzumab, and subsequently evaluating the triplet combination. The primary endpoint was to establish the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of tucatinib,evaluated by toxicity assessments. Efficacy was assessed in all patients bycontrast CT of the body. Analyses included all patients who had received at leastone dose of study treatment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,number NCT02025192.FINDINGS: Between Jan 15, 2014, and Dec 15, 2015, 60 patients were enrolled andtreated. The current report is from mature data as of June 30, 2017. Thetucatinib recommended phase 2 dose was determined to be 300 mg orally twice aday, equivalent to single-agent maximum tolerated dose. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there was no drug-drug interaction with capecitabine. Adverse events seen at the recommended phase 2 dose regardless of causality, grade, andtreatment group included diarrhoea (35 [67%] of 52 patients), nausea (31 [60%]patients), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (23 [44%] patients),fatigue (20 [38%] patients), and vomiting (20 [38%] patients). In all patients,treatment-related toxicities of grade 3 and worse included fatigue (five [8%]patients), diarrhoea (four [7%] patients), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia(four [7%] patients). No treatment-related deaths were reported. The proportionof patients with measurable disease achieving objective response was 83% (five ofsix patients) in the combination of tucatinib with capecitabine, 40% (six of 15patients) in the combination of tucatinib with trastuzumab, and 61% (14 of 23patients) in the combination of tucatinib with both capecitabine and trastuzumab.INTERPRETATION: Tucatinib in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab hadacceptable toxicity and showed preliminary anti-tumour activity. Validation ofthe current study results will be determined in the double-blinded randomisedstudy, HER2CLIMB (ONT-380-206; NCT02614794).FUNDING: Cascadian Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Seattle Genetics.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
