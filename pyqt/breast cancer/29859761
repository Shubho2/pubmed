Ultimately, the objective of salvagetherapy is to control disease while ensuring minimal collateral damage, therebyoptimizing both cancer and toxicity outcomes. Reirradiation has historically beenassociated with unacceptable toxicity and a limited benefit. Brachytherapy offersthe best dose distribution and a high radiation dose to the target volume whilebetter protecting surrounding previously irradiated healthy tissues. Themanagement of local cancer recurrence in irradiated areas should be plannedthrough multidisciplinary discussions and patients should be selected carefully. This overview of the literature describes brachytherapy as a reirradiationtreatment in local recurrences of previously irradiated prostate, breast, headand neck and rectal cancers, or second primary cancers occurring in-field. Forthese cancers, the prognosis and therapeutic challenges are quite different anddepend on the type of primary cancer. However, current data confirm thatbrachytherapy reirradiation is feasible and has acceptable toxicity.Copyright © 2018 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO).
