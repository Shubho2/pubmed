The medullaryphenotype and triple negative intrinsic subtypes are often, but not exclusivelyencountered in BRCA1 germline mutated breast cancer, whilst for BRCA2, noassociation to specific histological features are known. In this study, weaddressed the relationship between morphological medullary phenotype and BRCA1/2 somatic mutations in breast cancer without known positive family anamnesis.METHODS: 32 clinically sporadic breast cancers with medullary features wereanalyzed for somatic BRCA1/2 mutations (all coding exons) with next-generationsequencing technology. Paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed breast cancer samplesfrom all patients were analyzed.RESULTS: Three of 32 tumors (9%) had pathogenic (ARUP class-5) BRCA1 genealterations. Two of these pathogenic variants exhibited deletions leading toframeshift mutations (p.Glu23fs, p.Val1234fs), and the remainingsingle-nucleotid-variant resulted in premature STOP codon (p.Glu60Ter). In onepatient, the same pathogenic BRCA1 mutation was detected (p.Glu23fs) in normalbreast tissue. Retrospective follow-up in two patients revealed a positive familyhistory for breast cancer and consecutive germline mutation testing confirmedpresence of BRCA1 mutations. No somatic pathogenic BRCA2 mutations were detected.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA1 mutation testing may be useful in clinically sporadic breastcancer patients with medullary features to identify potential mutation carriersindependently from intrinsic molecular subtype. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cancer tissue can undergo testing within a routine molecular-diagnostic settingas a clinical BRCA1/2 mutation screening strategy.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2609-5 PMCID: PMC5916977PMID: 29453630  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
