[Epub ahead ofprint]Capsular fibrosis in aesthetic and reconstructive-cancer patients: Aretrospective analysis of 319 cases.Kuehlmann B(1)(2), Burkhardt R(2), Kosaric N(1), Prantl L(2).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Hagey Laboratory for Pediatric Regenerative Medicine,Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.(2)Center of Plastic, Aesthetic, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery, UniversityHospital Regensburg, Germany.BACKGROUND: Implant-based breast augmentation is one of the most frequentlyperformed operations in plastic surgery worldwide, for aesthetic andreconstructive reasons. Capsular fibrosis is the most common long-term foreignbody response after breast implant augmentation.OBJECTIVE: To compare the occurrence of capsular contracture in aesthetic andreconstructive-cancer patients, including those patients who receivedradiotherapy prior to breast reconstruction with implants.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective evaluation of 319 patients who underwentbreast implant revision between Jan 2000 and Oct 2016. The patient group wascomprised of 175 reconstructive-cancer patients and 144 patients who underwentoperation for aesthetic reasons. The occurrence of capsular fibrosis, othercomplications and the time-period between implantation of breast implants andrevision surgery (TP) was analyzed.RESULTS: For all 319 patients the mean TP was 7.9 years (7.86±0.45). The mostcommon complication in all revisions was capsular fibrosis (65.1% of allrevisions). In aesthetic patients with capsular fibrosis the mean TP was 11.9years (11.89±0.95, p < 0.001). This mean TP was significantly higher than themean TP of 6.1 years (6.13±0.56, p < 0.001) in breast cancer patients withcapsular fibrosis. Preoperatively irradiated cancer patients had a mean TP of 6.2years (6.17±0.95), compared to a mean TP of 5.1 years (5.07±0.19, p = 0.051) innon-irradiated cancer patients, which was not significantly different.CONCLUSIONS: We found that aesthetic patients exhibit a significantly higher meanTP compared to breast cancer patients, suggesting that reconstructive-cancerpatients in general develop capsular fibrosis earlier. Despite the literature, wedid not find a significant influence of preoperative radiotherapy on theoccurrence of capsular fibrosis in reconstructive-cancer patients. Furtherclinical studies need to be conducted to identify methods to decrease the risk ofdeveloping capsular fibrosis.DOI: 10.3233/CH-170365 PMID: 29710686
