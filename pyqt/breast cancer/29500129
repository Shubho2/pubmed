Electronic address: 830640@njucm.edu.cn.A new "turn-on" fluorescent probe, RDMBM, based on the rhodamine B dye and the2,5-pyrrolidinedione moiety was synthesized and characterized. Its sensingbehavior toward various amino acids was evaluated via UV-vis and fluorescencespectroscopic techniques. The observed spectral changes showed that RDMBMdisplays high selectivity and sensitivity toward GSH in MeOH/H2O (1:2, v/v, pH7.40, Tris-HCl buffer, 1 mM) solution and that it undergoes 1:1 covalent binding with GSH. More importantly, the hydrogenation and ring-opening of the nitrogenatom in the spirane structure of rhodamine B derivatives were tightly bound tothe induction effects of different groups. Furthermore, fluorescence imagingapplications demonstrated that RDMBM can be successfully used for the detectionof GSH in human breast cancer cells MCF-7.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
