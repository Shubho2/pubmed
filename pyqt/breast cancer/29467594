To understand the mechanisms underlying resistance to oxidativestress, we found that the chronic exposure to an H2O2-generating system(ascorbate/menadione, Asc/Men) or catalase overexpression (CAT3 cells) increased the resistance of cancer cells to oxidative stress, likely by increasing theantioxidant status of cancer cells.Methods: Modulation of catalase expression was performed by either proteinoverexpression or protein down-regulation using siRNA against catalase andaminotriazole as pharmacological inhibitor. The former approach was done bytransfecting cells with a plasmid construct containing human catalase cDNA (CAT3 cells, derived from MCF-7 breast cancer cell line) or by generating resistantcells through chronic exposure to an oxidant injury (Resox cells). Cell survival was monitored by using the MTT reduction assay and further calculation of IC50values. Protein expression was done by Western blots procedures. The formation ofreactive oxygen species was performed by flow cytometry. The transcriptionalactivity of human catalase promoter was assessed by using transfected cells with a plasmid containing the - 1518/+ 16 promoter domain.Results: Using Resox and CAT3 cells (derived from MCF-7 breast cancer cell line) as models for cancer resistance to pro-oxidative treatment, we found that arsenictrioxide (ATO) remarkably sensitized Resox and CAT3 cells to Asc/Men treatment.Since catalase is a key antioxidant enzyme involved in detoxifying Asc/Men (asshown by siRNA-mediated catalase knockdown) that is overexpressed in resistantcells, we hypothesized that ATO might regulate the expression levels of catalase.Consistently, catalase protein level is decreased in Resox cells when incubatedwith ATO likely by a decreased transcriptional activity of the catalase promoter.Conclusions: Our findings support the proposal that ATO should be administered incombination with pro-oxidant drugs to enhance cancer cell death in solid tumors.DOI: 10.1186/s12935-018-0524-0 PMCID: PMC5819285PMID: 29467594
