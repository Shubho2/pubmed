Its targeting efficiency andcytotoxicity against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) highly expressingα7-nAChR was investigated. A549, a non-small cell lung cancer cell line, wasselected as the cell model. The cellular uptake study showed that the optimalmodification ratio of ImI on micelle surface was 5% and ImI-modificationincreased intracellular delivery efficiency to A549 cells via receptor-mediatedendocytosis. Intracellular Ca2+ transient assay demonstrated that ImImodification led to enhanced molecular interaction between nanocarriers and A549 cells. The in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging further revealed thatImI-modified micelles could facilitate the drug accumulation in tumor sitescompared with non-modified micelles via α7-nAChR mediation. Moreover, docetaxel(DTX) was loaded in ImI-modified nanomedicines to evaluate its in vitrocytotoxicity. As a result, DTX-loaded ImI-PMs exhibited greateranti-proliferation effect on A549 cells compared with non-modified micelles.Generally, our study proved that ImI-modified micelles had targeting ability toNSCLC in addition to breast cancer and it may provide a promising strategy todeliver drugs to NSCLC overexpressing α7-nAChR.DOI: 10.1080/10717544.2018.1436097 PMID: 29426250
