Epub2017 Nov 15.Targeted therapy of brain metastases: latest evidence and clinical implications.Di Lorenzo R(1), Ahluwalia MS(2).Author information: (1)Brain Tumor and Neuro-Oncology Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland,OH, USA.(2)Brain Tumor and Neuro-Oncology Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, 9500Euclid Avenue, CA-51, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.Brain metastases (BM) occur in 20-40% of patients with cancer and 60-75% ofpatients with BM become symptomatic. Due to an aging population and advances inthe treatment of primary cancers, patients are living longer and are more likely to experience complications from BM. The diagnosis of BM drastically worsenslong-term survival rates, with multiple metastases being a poor prognosticfactor. Until recently, the mainstay of treatment consisted of stereotacticradiosurgery (SRS), surgical resection, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), or a combination of these modalities. Systemic chemotherapy has been felt largelyineffective in the treatment of BM due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier(BBB), which includes efflux pumps on brain capillaries. Over the past decadehowever, researchers have identified therapeutic agents that are able to crossthe BBB. These findings could make a multimodality treatment approach possible,consisting of surgery, radiation, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, whichcould lead to better disease control in this patient population and prolongsurvival. In this review, we discuss present evidence on available targetedtherapies and their role in the treatment of BM from primary tumors with thehighest prevalence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, specificallynon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer melanoma, and renal cellcarcinoma.DOI: 10.1177/1758834017736252 PMCID: PMC5808839PMID: 29449898
