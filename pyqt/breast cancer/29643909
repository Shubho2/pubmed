Professor of Pathology, Hamdard College ofMedicine & Dentistry, Hamdard University, Karachi, Pakistan.Objective: The study was designed to determine the hyperlipidemia in breastcancer of patients at disease presentation, without any treatment and tocorrelate these variations with disease stage.Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted at Liaquat National teachinghospital in Karachi from 2006 to 2011, Age and family history of 208 breastcancer patients with infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma were compared with 176 matchedcontrol subjects. Married females were selected, with children and short breastfeeding period. Cancer stage I-III was considered for the study and patients weregrouped on the basis of Tumor grade, Tumor size, lymph node metastasis anddisease free survival. Disease staging was based on tumor size and lymph nodemetastasis. Biochemical estimations included variations in random blood glucoselevel and lipid profile.Results: Lipid profile and random blood glucose level were found significantlyhigh (p<0.05) compared to control subjects. Hyperlipidemia was significantly highin breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis. On increase in tumor grade I to II, increase in total cholesterol (4%), LDL-cholesterol 23% and 11% increasein triglycerides was observed. On Tumor size increase from â‰¤2 to 2.5cm, increase observed in blood random glucose level was (4%), total cholesterol (1.7%)triglycerides (2%) and LDL (3%) whereas HDL was (2%) low. These variations remaininsignificant on further increase in tumor size and grade.Conclusion: Study suggests that variation in lipid profile and blood randomglucose level is associated with disease stage. No independent correlation ofhyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia was developed with disease free survival.DOI: 10.12669/pjms.341.14841 PMCID: PMC5857015PMID: 29643909
