Weaimed to estimate the direct medical costs associated with FN management inbreast cancer patients within a clinical trial with pegfilgrastim, a pegylatedform of recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).Methods: We obtained data from 346 Japanese breast cancer patients in arandomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing FN incidence due to TCadjuvant chemotherapy (docetaxel 75 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2) betweenpegfilgrastim-treated and placebo groups. We estimated mean costs forchemotherapy drugs, drugs for all AEs and FN, and hospitalization for all AEs andFN. We also calculated mean costs associated with drugs and hospitalization forFN specifically for patients who developed FN in the placebo group.Results: For the pegfilgrastim and placebo groups, the total cost during thefirst cycle of chemotherapy was ¥189 135 and ¥98 106. This difference isassociated with prophylactic use of pegfilgrastim. Our analysis clarified in the placebo group that FN incidents of 119/173 (68.6%), the mean drug cost related toall AEs and hospitalization caused by the first cycle of chemotherapy were ¥14411and ¥11 180, respectively. The cost of each for FN treatment was ¥16 429 forthe placebo group. The mean treatment cost for patients who developed FN inplacebo group, was ¥11 145 for drugs and ¥28 420 for drugs and hospitalization.Conclusions: Pegfilgrastim reduced the costs incurred for both drugs andhospitalization for AEs as well as FN, although the total medical cost during thechemotherapy increased. Our study constitutes baseline data for further healtheconomic evaluations of pegfilgrastim.DOI: 10.1093/jjco/hyy030 PMID: 29590407  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
