Italy.This article reviews the principal attempts of immune-modulation or immunetherapy in metastatic breast cancer. It considers their rationale and reports on results from the relevant key clinical trials. Immune-modulatory orimmune-stimulating cytokines used alone or combined with conventional therapiesis among the principal approaches of immune manipulation in breast cancer. Asthis issue was recently reviewed by us, the aim of the current article is todiscuss our updated and unpublished data on this topic. Overall survival inluminal (28 patients) and non-luminal (9 patients) molecular subtypes is 91 and59 months respectively that is about two and half or three times longer thanexpected. Thereafter, we focus on monoclonal antibodies (mAb) based-therapiesincluding novel strategies to overcome resistance to anti-HER2 mAb. The mainvaccine platforms in different molecular subtypes and immune therapies in triple negative metastatic breast cancer (m-TNBC) are discussed in the last sections.Some phase III investigations have already changed the current clinical practice.In fact, pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and docetaxel is the recommended first line regimen in HER2 positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer andbevacizumab plus paclitaxel or docetaxel is a reasonable option for m-TNBC. Insome other observational or phase I/II studies on first-line trastuzumab pluschemotherapy and hormonal therapy and in that on HER2 peptide/protein vaccinespromising although preliminary findings have been reported to be furthervalidated. In the remaining studies, results were disappointing. In the future,finding new predictive biomarkers and exploring more suitable synergizingcombinations, time and dose-dependent-scheduled sequences of currently andfurther investigated immunological approaches are main challenges.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/0929867325666180209124052 PMID: 29424297
