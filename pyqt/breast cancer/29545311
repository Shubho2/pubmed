A recently developed approach in drug development is small molecule-mediated,selective degradation of dysregulated proteins. We have devised aprotein-knockdown system that utilizes chimeric molecules termed specific andnongenetic IAP-dependent protein erasers (SNIPERs) to induce ubiquitylation andproteasomal degradation of various target proteins. SNIPER(ER)-87 consists of an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) ligand LCL161 derivative that is conjugated to the estrogen receptor α (ERα) ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen by a PEG linker, andwe have previously reported that this SNIPER efficiently degrades the ERαprotein. Here, we report that derivatization of the IAP ligand module yieldsSNIPER(ER)s with superior protein-knockdown activity. These improved SNIPER(ER)s exhibited higher binding affinities to IAPs and induced more potent degradationof ERα than does SNIPER(ER)-87. Further, they induced simultaneous degradation ofcellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) and delayed degradation ofX-linked IAP (XIAP). Notably, these reengineered SNIPER(ER)s efficiently induced apoptosis in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells that require IAPs for continuedcellular survival. We found that one of these molecules, SNIPER(ER)-110, inhibitsthe growth of MCF-7 tumor xenografts in mice more potently than the previouslycharacterized SNIPER(ER)-87. Mechanistic analysis revealed that our novelSNIPER(ER)s preferentially recruit XIAP, rather than cIAP1, to degrade ERα. Ourresults suggest that derivatized IAP ligands could facilitate further developmentof SNIPERs with potent protein-knockdown and cytocidal activities against cancer cells requiring IAPs for survival.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.001091 PMCID: PMC5936811 [Available on 2019-05-04]PMID: 29545311
