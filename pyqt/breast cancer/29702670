Genetic programming (GP) is a stochastic approach to solving a problem. For high dimensional datasets, GP does not perform as well as other machinelearning algorithms. To explore the inherent property of GP to generalize models from low dimensional data, we need to consider dimensionality reductionapproaches. Random projections (RPs) have gained attention for reducing thedimensionality of data with reduced computational cost, compared to otherdimensionality reduction approaches. We report that the features constructed fromRPs perform extremely well when combined with a GP approach. We used eightdatasets out of which seven have not been reported as being used in any machinelearning research before. We have also compared our results by using the samefull and constructed features for decision trees, random forest, naive Bayes,support vector machines and k-nearest neighbor methods.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196385 PMCID: PMC5922581PMID: 29702670  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
