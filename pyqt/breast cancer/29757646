The cyclotides Poca Aand B (1 and 2) and the previously known CyO4 (3) were de novo sequenced byMALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (MS). The MS2 spectra were examined and the aminoacid sequences were determined. The purified peptides were tested for theircytotoxicity and effects on cell migration of MDA-MB-231, a triple-negativebreast cancer cell line. The isolated cyclotides reduced the number of cancercells by more than 80% at 20 μM, and the concentration-related cytotoxicresponses were observed with IC50 values of 1.8, 2.7, and 9.8 μM for Poca A (1), Poca B (2), and CyO4 (3), respectively. Additionally, the inhibition of cellmigration (wound-healing assay) exhibited that CyO4 (3) presents an interestingactivity profile, in being able to inhibit cell migration (50%) at a subtoxicconcentration (2 μM). The distribution of these cyclotides in the roots wasanalyzed by MALDI imaging, demonstrating that all three compounds are present in the phloem and cortical parenchyma regions.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b00969 PMCID: PMC5974699PMID: 29757646
