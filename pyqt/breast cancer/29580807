Electronic address: behravanj@mums.ac.ir.Phage display technique has been increasingly researched for vaccine design anddelivery strategies in recent years. In this study, the AE37 (Ii-Key/HER-2/neu776-790) peptide derived from HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptorprotein) was used as a fused peptide to the lambda phage (λF7) coat protein gpD, and the phage nanoparticles were used to induce antitumor immunogenicity in aTUBO model of breast cancer in mice. Mice were immunized with the AE37 peptidedisplaying phage, λF7 (gpD::AE37) every 2-week intervals over 6-weeks, then thegenerated immune responses were evaluated. An induction of CTL immune response bythe λF7 (gpD::AE37) construct compared to the control λF7 and buffer groups wasobserved in vitro. Moreover, in the in vivo studies, the vaccine candidate showedpromising prophylactic and therapeutic effects against the HER2 overexpressingcancer in BALB/c mice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
