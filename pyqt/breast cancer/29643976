As an essential evolutionary catabolicprocess of cytoplasmatic component digestion, it is generally believed thatmodulating autophagic activity, through targeting specific regulatory actors inthe core autophagy machinery, may impact disease processes. Both autophagyupregulation and downregulation have been found in cancers, suggesting its dualoncogenic and tumor suppressor properties during malignant transformation.Identification of the key autophagy targets is essential for the development ofnew therapeutic agents. Despite this great potential, no therapies are currently available that specifically focus on autophagy modulation. Although drugs likerapamycin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and others act as autophagymodulators, they were not originally developed for this purpose. Thus, autophagy may represent a new and promising pharmacologic target for future drugdevelopment and therapeutic applications in human diseases. Here, we summarizeour current knowledge in regard to the interplay between autophagy and malignancyin the most significant tumor types: pancreatic, breast, hepatocellular,colorectal, and lung cancer, which have been studied in respect to autophagymanipulation as a promising therapeutic strategy. Finally, we present an overviewof the most recent advances in therapeutic strategies involving autophagymodulators in cancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/8023821 PMCID: PMC5831833PMID: 29643976
