A novel 3D breast ultrasound imaging ring system using the linear arraytransducer is proposed to decrease costs, reduce processing difficulties, andimprove patient comfort as compared to modern day breast screening systems. The 1&times; 128 Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (PMUT) linear arrayis placed 90 degrees cross-vertically. The transducer surrounds the mammarygland, which allows for non-contact detection. Once the experimental platform is built, the breast model is placed through the electric rotary table opening andinto a water tank that is at a constant temperature of 32 &deg;C. The electricrotary table performs a 360&deg; scan either automatically or mechanically. Pulseecho signals are captured through a circular scanning method at discrete angles. Subsequently, an ultrasonic tomography algorithm is designed, and a horizontalslice imaging is realized. The experimental results indicate that the preliminarydetection of mass is realized by using this ring system. Circular scanningimaging is obtained by using a rotatable linear array instead of a cylindricalarray, which allows the size and location of the mass to be recognized. Theresolution of breast imaging is improved through the adjustment of the angleinterval (>0.05&deg;) and multiple slices are gained through different transducerarray elements (1 &times; 128). These results validate the feasibility of thesystem design as well as the algorithm, and encourage us to implement our conceptwith a clinical study in the future.DOI: 10.3390/s18051332 PMCID: PMC5982653PMID: 29693610
