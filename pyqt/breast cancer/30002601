Despite several efforts and improvements in early diagnosis andtreatment, there are still tumors characterized by an aggressive behavior due to unfavorable biology, thus quite difficult to treat. In this view, searching fornovel potential biomarkers is mandatory. Among them, in the recent years datahave been gathered addressing ion channel as important players in oncology.Methods: A retrospective pilot study was performed on 40 BC samples by means ofimmunohistochemistry in order to evaluate hERG1 potassium channels expression in BC.Results: We provide evidence that hERG1 is expressed in all the BC samplesanalyzed. hERG1 expression was significantly associated with molecular subtypewith the highest expression in Luminal A and the lowest in basal-like tumors(p = 0.001), tumor grading (the highest hERG1 expression in well-moderatedifferentiated tumors, p = 0.020), estrogen receptors (high hERG1 expression inER-positive samples, p = 0.008) and Ki67 proliferative index (high hERG1 scoring in samples with low proliferative index, p = 0.038). Also, a p value close tosignificance was noticed for the association between hERG1 and HER2 expression(p = 0.079). At the survival analysis, patients with high hERG1 expression turnedout to have a longer progression-free survival, although statistical significancewas not reached (p = 0.195). The same trend was observed analyzing local relapse free-survival (LRFS) and metastases-free survival (MFS): patients with higherhERG1 scoring had longer LRFS and MFS (p = 0.124 and p = 0.071, respectively).Conclusions: The results of this pilot study provide the first evidence that the hERG1 protein is expressed in primary BC, and its expression associates withmolecular subtype. hERG1 apparently behaves as a protective factor, since itcontributes to identify a subset of patients with better outcome. Overall, these data suggest that hERG1 might be an additional tool for the management of BC,nevertheless further investigations are warranted to better clarify hERG1 roleand clinical usefulness in BC.DOI: 10.1186/s12935-018-0592-1 PMCID: PMC6034270PMID: 30002601
