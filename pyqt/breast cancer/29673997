The aim of this work is tomeasure the level of agreement between expert radiologists when delineating andclassifying breast lesions as demonstrated through Breast Imaging Reporting andData System (BI-RADS) and quantitative shape metrics.METHODS: Forty mammographic images, each containing a single lesion, werepresented to nine expert breast radiologists using a high specificationinteractive digital drawing tablet with stylus. Each reader was asked to manuallydelineate the breast masses using the tablet and stylus and then visuallyclassify the lesion according to the American College of Radiology (ACR) BI-RADS lexicon. The delineated lesion compactness and elongation were computed usingMatlab software. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Cohen's kappa were used to assess inter-observer agreement for delineation and classificationoutcomes, respectively.RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement was fair for BI-RADS shape (kappa = 0.37) andmoderate for margin (kappa = 0.58) assessments. Agreement for quantitative shape metrics was good for lesion elongation (ICC = 0.82) and excellent for compactness(ICC = 0.93).CONCLUSIONS: Fair to moderate levels of agreement was shown by radiologists forshape and margin classifications of cancers using the BI-RADS lexicon. Whenquantitative shape metrics were used to evaluate radiologists' delineation oflesions, good to excellent inter-observer agreement was found. The resultssuggest that qualitative descriptors such as BI-RADS lesion shape and marginunderstate the actual level of expert radiologist agreement.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
