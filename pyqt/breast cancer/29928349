China.Lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A), also known as JMJD1A, has been associated withmetastasis and poor prognosis in several cancer types, including renal cellcarcinoma, prostate cancer and Ewing sarcoma. However, little is known regarding the clinicopathological significance of KDM3A expression in breast cancer (BCa). To investigate the clinical relevance of KDM3A expression in the setting of BCa, immunohistochemistry was performed on a tissue microarray consisting of 150commercially available BCa samples. No significant correlation was identifiedbetween KDM3A expression and various clinicopathological variables, includingclinical stage, pathological grade, tumor size and the expression statuses ofhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2, estrogen receptor, and progesteronereceptor. In addition, no significant association between KDM3A expression andoverall prognosis was observed. Taken together, these findings suggest that thereis no significant association between KDM3A expression and clinicopathologicalvariables, indicating that KDM3A may not be associated with the malignantbehavior of BCa.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8578 PMCID: PMC6004682PMID: 29928349
