Epub2018 May 7.A Phenotypic Cell-Binding Screen Identifies a Novel Compound TargetingTriple-Negative Breast Cancer.Chen L(1), Long C(1), Youn J(1), Lee J(1).Author information: (1)Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , The University of Texas at Dallas ,Richardson , Texas 75080 , United States.We describe a "phenotypic cell-binding screen" by which therapeutic candidatetargeting cancer cells of a particular phenotype can be isolated withoutknowledge of drug targets. Chemical library beads are incubated with cancer cellsof the phenotype of interest in the presence of cancer cells lacking thephenotype of interest, and then the beads bound to only cancer cells of thephenotype of interest are selected as hits. We have applied this screeningstrategy in discovering a novel compound (LC129-8) targeting triple-negativebreast cancer (TNBC). LC129-8 displayed highly specific binding to TNBC in cancercell lines and patient-derived tumor tissues. LC129-8 exerted anti-TNBC activity by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation, reversing epithelial-mesenchymaltransition, downregulating cancer stem cell activity and blocking in vivo tumorgrowth.DOI: 10.1021/acscombsci.8b00026 PMID: 29718663
