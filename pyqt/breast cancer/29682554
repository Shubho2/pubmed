These molecules play important roles in thedevelopment of multicellular organisms, and the physiological functions of these receptor-ligand pairs have been extensively documented in axon guidance, neuronaldevelopment, vascular patterning, and inflammation during tissue injury. Therecognition that aberrant regulation and expression of these molecules lead toalterations in proliferative, migratory, and invasive potential of a variety ofhuman cancers has made them potential targets for cancer therapeutics. We presenthere the involvement of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands in lung carcinoma,breast carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, glioblastoma, andmedulloblastoma. The aberrations in their abundances are described in the contextof multiple signaling pathways, and differential expression is suggested as themechanism underlying tumorigenesis.DOI: 10.1155/2018/7390104 PMCID: PMC5851329PMID: 29682554
