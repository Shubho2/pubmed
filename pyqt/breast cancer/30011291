The study cohort consisted of 95 breast cancer patients treated withhybrid IMRT. RD grade ≥2 (2+) toxicity was defined as clinically significant.Patient characteristics and the irradiation treatment planning parameters wereused as the initial candidate factors. Prognostic factors were identified usingthe least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-based normal tissuecomplication probability (NTCP) model. A univariate cut-off dose NTCP model wasdeveloped to find the dose-volume limitation. Fifty-two (54.7%) of ninety-fivepatients experienced acute RD grade 2+ toxicity. The volume of skin receiving adose >35 Gy (V35) was the most significant dosimetric predictor associated withRD grade 2+ toxicity. The NTCP model parameters for V35Gy were TV50 = 85.7 mL andγ50 = 0.77, where TV50 was defined as the volume corresponding to a 50% incidenceof complications, and γ50 was the normalized slope of the volume-response curve. Additional potential predictive patient characteristics were energy and surgery, but the results were not statistically significant. To ensure a better quality oflife and compliance for breast hybrid IMRT patients, the skin volume receiving a dose >35 Gy should be limited to <85.7 mL to keep the incidence of RD grade 2+toxicities below 50%. To avoid RD toxicity, the volume of skin receiving a dose>35 Gy should follow sparing tolerance and the inherent patient characteristicsshould be considered.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200192 PMCID: PMC6047778PMID: 30011291
