The impact of p95expression on trastuzumab treatment efficacy in early HER2-positive breast canceris less clear. In the current study, p95 was tested as a predictive marker oftrastuzumab treatment benefit in the HER2-positive subset of the FinHer adjuvant phase III trial.Experimental Design: In the FinHer trial, 232 patients withHER2-positive early breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy plus 9 weeks of trastuzumab or no trastuzumab treatment. Quantitative p95 proteinexpression was measured in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples using the p95VeraTag assay (Monogram Biosciences), specific for the M611 form of p95.Quantitative HER2 protein expression was measured using the HERmark assay(Monogram Biosciences). Distant disease-free survival (DDFS) was used as theprimary outcome measure.Results: In the arm receiving chemotherapy only,increasing log10(p95) correlated with shorter DDFS (HR, 2.0; P = 0.02). In thearm receiving chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (N = 95), increasing log10(p95) wasnot correlated with a shorter DDFS. In a combined analysis of both treatmentarms, high breast tumor p95 content was significantly correlated with trastuzumabtreatment benefit in multivariate models (interaction P = 0.01).Conclusions: Ahigh p95HER2/HER2 ratio identified patients with metastatic breast cancer withpoor outcomes on trastuzumab-based therapies. Further investigation of thep95HER2/HER2 ratio as a potential prognostic or predictive biomarker forHER2-targeted therapy is warranted.
