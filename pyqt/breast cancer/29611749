By the analysis of 67 retrospectivestudies and reviews the numerical effects of treatment initiation time onsurvival were assessed. The "time factor" has a leading role on cancer types withaggressive biological behaviour, like breast cancer in younger age, testicularcancers, or head and neck tumours. However, a few days and reasonable delay tothe first oncology intervention has no negative impact in numerous cancerdiseases. The course of the primary check-up could be modified by several medicaland psychosocial factors, and many times the treatment of the most advancedcancers are privileged causing an inverse survival effect. The effectiveness ofthe cancer therapies is determined by the optimal treatment decision, however,further research is necessary for the determination of the exact role of the"time factor" in oncology.
