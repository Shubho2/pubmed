During a median follow-up of16.1 years, 177 women died; 119 from breast cancer.RESULTS: There was a general inverse association with PCB-concentration (e.g.ΣPCBs: Mortality Rate Ratio (MRR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.64-0.98) per inter-quartile range (IQR)), and for all pesticides, exceptβ-Hexachlorocyclohexane, which was not associated with mortality (MRR1.02(0.87-1.18) per IQR), and dieldrin, which was associated with a significantlyincreased risk of death (MRR 1.22(1.05-1.41) per IQR). We found an interactionwith prognostic factors for all PCBs, confining the inverse association to those with adverse prognostic factors. Results for pesticides suggested a similar, but mostly non-significant interaction. Dieldrin diverged from the general picture bybeing associated with increased mortality across all strata.CONCLUSION: A higher concentration of PCBs and several organochlorine pesticides may be inversely associated with breast cancer mortality among women with adverseprognostic factors. Further studies are required to investigate if this is acausal association. Dieldrin was associated with a higher mortality, regardlessof prognostic factors.IMPACT: This is the first study to investigate an association betweenorganochlorine concentrations in adipose tissue and breast cancer mortality. Aprominent finding is a strong interaction with prognostic factors. The unexpecteddirection of association for most organochlorines encourages further studies ofthe role of individual metabolism of the organochlorines and a potentiallystronger effect of the metabolites on mortality.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
