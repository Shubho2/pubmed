The Ministry of Health and FamilyWelfare has released an Operational Framework for the Management of CommonCancers that highlights population-based cancer screening programs in primaryhealth care facilities by health care providers (HCPs) and capacity building ofHCPs. The purpose of this study is to present a low-cost training model that ishighly suitable for resource-deficient settings, such as those found in India,through Extension for Community Health Outcome (ECHO), a knowledge-sharing tool, to enable high-quality training of HCPs. Materials and Methods An in-person,3-day training program was conducted for 27 HCPs in the tribal primary healthcare center of Gumballi in Karnataka, India, to teach the basics of cancerscreening in oral, breast, and cervical cancer. The training of HCPs was doneusing the ECHO platform while they implemented the cancer screening, thusenabling them to build the much needed knowledge and skill set to conduct cancer screening in their respective communities. Results The knowledge level of theHCPs was tracked before the intervention, immediately after the 3-day trainingprogram, and 6 months after the ECHO intervention, which clearly showedprogressive acquisition and retention of knowledge. A marked improvement inknowledge level score from an average of 6.3 to 13.7 on a 15-point scale wasnoticed after the initial in-person training. The average knowledge furtherincreased to a score of 14.4 after 6 months as a result of training using theECHO platform. Conclusion ECHO is an affordable and effective model to train HCPsin cancer screening in a resource-constrained setting.DOI: 10.1200/JGO.18.00048 PMID: 30084700
