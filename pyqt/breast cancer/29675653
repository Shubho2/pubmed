[Epub ahead of print]Medical Student Exposure to Cancer Patients Whilst on Clinical Placement: aRetrospective Analyses of Clinical Log Books.Starmer DL(1).Author information: (1)School of Medicine, The University of Notre Dame Australia, PO Box 1225,Fremantle, WA, 6959, Australia. darren.starmer@nd.edu.au.In Australia, one in two men and one in three women will be diagnosed with cancerby the age of 85. Several studies have demonstrated a decline in the number ofmedical graduates having examined cancer patients during their training. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure of medical students to cancer patientsduring clinical placements. Eighty-eight logbooks (response rate = 24.75%)containing 9430 patients were analysed. A total of 829 patients (8.79%) had adiagnosis of cancer. Most cancer patients were seen on surgical placements,whilst general practice placements returned the lowest numbers. None were seen inpaediatrics or ophthalmology. Given the role surgery plays in the staging andtreatment of cancer, it is unsurprising that most cancer patients were seenduring surgery.  Most concerning was the number of patients with common cancersseen by our students. Only 46% of students saw a patient with breast cancer. Evenfewer saw patients with colorectal (41%), lung (32%) and prostate cancer (30%).Only 14% saw a melanoma patient. Variability in the quality of the logbooks isthe main limitation of this study, and therefore, it is not a complete picture ofcancer patient exposure. However, it builds upon previous studies by providinginsight to the number and types of cancer patients to which students wereexposed. Overall, the exposure to common cancers remains concerning and furtherresearch is needed to explore the type and quality of these interactions over thecourse of an entire year.DOI: 10.1007/s13187-018-1354-4 PMID: 29675653
