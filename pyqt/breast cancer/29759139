Data were analyzedusing random forest regression to identify the most significant predictors foreach of the cognitive test scores.RESULTS: A different cytokine profile predicted each cognitive test. Adjusted R2 for each model ranged from 0.71-0.77 (p's < 9.50-10). The relationships betweenall the cytokine predictors and cognitive test scores were non-linear.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are unique to the field of CRCI and suggest non-linear cytokine specificity to neural networks underlying cognitive functions assessedin this study.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
