Application ofmultiple drugs using nanocarriers is a promising approach to simultaneouslyeliminate noncancer stem cells (non-CSCs) and CSCs. Herein, to employ theadvantages of nanomedicine while avoiding new excipients, pH-responsive prodrug(PEG-CH═N-DOX) was employed as the surfactant to fabricate cargo-freenanomedicine for codelivery of DOX conjugated prodrug with SN38 tosynergistically eradicate breast cancer stem cells (bCSCs) and non-bCSCs. Throughthe intermolecular interaction between DOX and SN38, PEG-CH═N-DOX and SN38 wereassembled together to form a stable nanomedicine. This nanomedicine not onlydramatically enhanced drug accumulation efficiency at the tumor site but alsoeffectively eliminated bCSCs and non-bCSCs, which resulted in achieving asuperior in vivo tumor inhibition activity. Additionally, the biosafety of thisnanomedicine was systematically studied through immunohistochemistry, bloodbiochemistry assay, blood routine examination, and metabolomics. The resultsrevealed that this nanomedicine significantly reduced the adverse effects of DOX and SN38. Therefore, this simple yet efficient nanomedicine provided a promising strategy for future clinical applications.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00367 PMID: 29923726
