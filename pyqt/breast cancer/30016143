Uptake was matched with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Atlas of Rural and Small Town Americacategorizations along a rural-urban continuum scale from 1 to 9 based on countypopulation size (large urban, population â‰¥ 20,000 people; small urban, < 20,000people) and proximity to a metropolitan area. Univariable and multivariableanalyses were performed.RESULTS: In all, 2,243,294 Medicare beneficiaries were eligible for mammograms.National mean uptake per county was 60.5% (range, 26.0-86.0%). Uptake wassignificantly higher in metropolitan and large urban counties in 25 states andlower in only one. County-level mammographic uptake was moderately positivelycorrelated with percentage of residents with some college education (r = 0.40, p < 0.001) and moderately negatively correlated with age-adjusted mortality (r =-0.41, p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that percentage of white andblack residents and age-adjusted mortality rate were the strongest significantindependent predictors of uptake.CONCLUSION: Uptake of mammographic screening services in a Medicare populationvaries widely at the county level and is generally lowest in rural counties andurban counties with fewer than 20,000 people.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.18.19541 PMID: 30016143
