This systematic reviewdescribes the literature regarding the associations of physician characteristics with the implementation of and referral of patients for selected cancer screeningtests. In October 2016, the authors conducted a thorough search of articles foundin 4 databases, using keywords describing physician characteristics and cancerscreening. English-language articles reporting on patient surveys or records ofpatients' screening history, and surveys of physicians' practices or opinions, inthe United States were included. The physician characteristics most commonlyanalyzed were specialty and sex. The screening tests most commonly analyzed were those for cervical and colorectal cancers. Female and white physicians were foundto screen more patients than male and nonwhite physicians.Obstetrician-gynecologists screened more for breast and cervical cancer thaninternists, who screened more than family or general practitioners. Physiciansex, race, and specialty were consistently associated with cancer screeningpractices and should be the focus of efforts to harmonize practices withrecommendations.DOI: 10.1089/pop.2017.0206 PMID: 29889616
