Using the Monte Carlosimulation, the maximum expected cost was estimated to broaden such monitoring.Morbimortality information of the Ministry of Health and cases of breast cancertreated by the SPSS were used.Results: Between 2013 and 2026, the financial resources to provide monitoringduring 10 years to women diagnosed with breast cancer would reach up to $3607.40 million pesos on a base scenario, $4151.79 million pesos on the pessimisticscenario and $3414.85 million pesos on an optimistic scenario. In the basescenario, additional expenditure represents an annual increase of 9.1% ofresources allocated to treating this disease, and 3.0% of the availability of theresources for the Fondo de Protección contra Gastos Catastróficos (FPGC-Fund for Protection against Catastrophic Expenditure).Conclusions: Increasing monitoring for patients with breast cancer would notrepresent a financial risk to the sustainability of the FPGC, and could increase patients survival and life quality.DOI: 10.1186/s12962-018-0094-y PMCID: PMC5844112PMID: 29540999
