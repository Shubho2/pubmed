Previous studies showed increases in detection rate (DR) after thetransition to DM. However, national interval cancer rates (ICR) have not yet beenreported.METHODS: We assessed programme sensitivity and specificity during the transition period to DM, analysing nationwide data on screen-detected and interval cancers. Data of 7.3 million screens in women aged 49-74, between 2004 and 2011, werelinked to the Netherlands Cancer Registry to obtain data on interval cancers.Age-adjusted DRs, ICRs and recall rates (RR) per 1000 screens and programmesensitivity and specificity were calculated by year, age and screening modality.RESULTS: 41,662 screen-detected and 16,160 interval cancers were analysed. The DRsignificantly increased from 5.13 (95% confidence interval (CI):5.00-5.30) in2004 to 6.34 (95% CI:6.15-6.47) in 2011, for both in situ (2004:0.73;2011:1.24)and invasive cancers (2004:4.42;2011:5.07), whereas the ICR remained stable(2004: 2.16 (95% CI2.06-2.25);2011: 2.13 (95% CI:2.04-2.22)). The RR changedsignificantly from 14.0 to 21.4. Programme sensitivity significantly increased,mainly between ages 49-59, from 70.0% (95% CI:68.9-71.2) to 74.4% (95%CI:73.5-75.4) whereas specificity slightly declined (2004:99.1% (95%CI:99.09-99.13);2011:98.5% (95% CI:98.45-98.50)). The overall DR wassignificantly higher for DM than for SFM (6.24;5.36) as was programme sensitivity(73.6%;70.1%), the ICR was similar (2.19;2.20) and specificity was significantly lower for DM (98.5%;98.9%).CONCLUSIONS: During the transition from SFM to DM, there was a significant risein DR and a stable ICR, leading to increased programme sensitivity. Although the recall rate increased, programme specificity remained high compared to othercountries. These findings indicate that the performance of DM in a nationwidescreening programme is not inferior to, and may be even better, than that of SFM.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4122-2 PMCID: PMC5839006PMID: 29506487
