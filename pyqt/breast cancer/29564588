In this study, we identify the risks of LRR after mastectomy in patients with T1-2N1 disease, treated with modernchemotherapy, and identify predictors of LRR when omitting PMRT.METHODS: Patients with T1-2N1 breast cancer undergoing mastectomy between 1995and 2006 were categorized by receipt of PMRT. The Chi square test compared theclinicopathologic features between both groups, and Kaplan-Meier and Coxregression analysis was used to determine the rates of LRR, recurrence-freesurvival (RFS), and overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Overall, 1087 patients (924 no PMRT, 163 PMRT) were included in thestudy, with a median follow-up of 10.8 years (range 0-21). We identified 63 LRRs (56 no PMRT, 7 PMRT), and 10-year rates of LRR with and without PMRT were 4.0%and 7.0%, respectively. Patients receiving PMRT were younger (p = 0.019), hadlarger tumors (p = 0.0013), higher histologic grade (p = 0.029), more positiveLNs (p < 0.0001), lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (p < 0.0001), extracapsular nodalextension (p < 0.0001), and macroscopic LN metastases (p < 0.0001). There was no difference in LRR, RFS, or OS between groups. On multivariate analysis,age < 40 years (p < 0.0001) and LVI (p < 0.0001) were associated with LRR inthose not receiving PMRT.CONCLUSION: Consistent with the guidelines, 85% of patients with T1-2N1 werespared PMRT at our center, while maintaining low LRR. Age < 40 years and thepresence of LVI are significantly associated with LRR in those not receivingPMRT.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6422-9 PMCID: PMC5976529 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29564588
