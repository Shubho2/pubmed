[Epub ahead of print]Differential altered expression of let-7a and miR-205 tumor-suppressor miRNAs in different subtypes of breast cancer under treatment with Taxol.Asghari F(1)(2), Haghnavaz N(1), Shanehbandi D(1), Khaze V(1), Baradaran B(1),Kazemi T(1).Author information: (1)Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran.(2)Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, IranBACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which have beenconsidered as major players in the process of carcinogenesis and drugresponsiveness of breast cancer.OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression pattern oflet-7a and miR-205 tumorsuppressor miRNAs in breast cancer cell lines undertreatment with paclitaxel.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) ofpaclitaxel was determined for 4 breast cancer cell lines, including MCF-7,MDA-MB-231, SKBR-3, and BT-474 by an MTT assay. The expression level of let-7aand miR-205, and their targets, K-RAS and HER3, was determined before and aftertreatment with paclitaxel, using quantitative reverse transcriptase real-timepolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).RESULTS: After treatment, the expression level of both let-7a and miR-205 wassignificantly increased in HER2- overexpressing cell line BT-474 (26.4- and7.2-fold, respectively). In contrast, the HER2-negative cell lines MCF-7 andMDA-MB-231 showed a significantly decreased expression of both let-7a (30.3- and 13.5-fold, respectively) and miR-205 (20- and 18.1-fold, respectively).Controversially, SKBR-3 revealed a significantly decreased expression of bothlet-7a (1.3-fold) and miR-205 (1.3-fold). The expression level of K-RAS as atarget of let-7a decreased in all cell lines significantly, but the pattern ofalteration in the expression level of HER3 as a target of miR-205 in all celllines was the reverse of the pattern of alteration in the expression level ofmiR-205.CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed a better response of HER2-overexpressingbreast cancer to paclitaxel at the miRNA level. One putative reason could be the upregulation of tumor-suppressor miRNAs after treatment with paclitaxel. On theother hand, HER2-negative breast cancer cell lines showed a significantlydecreased expression of tumor-suppressor miRNAs, a putative mechanism ofresisting the therapy.DOI: 10.17219/acem/70745 PMID: 30019863
