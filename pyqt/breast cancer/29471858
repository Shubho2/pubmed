MicroRNAs play a key role in breast cancer development and progression. microRNA(miR)-8084 has been observedan aberrant expression in breast cancer. However, the functions and regulatoryaxes of miR-8084, particularly in breast cancer, were not entirely clear.METHODS: miR-8084 expression in breast cancer were investigated in a GEO dataset by in silico analysis and in 42 paired tumor tissues by qPCR. The effects ofderegulation of miR-8084 on breast cancer cell proliferation, migration andinvasion in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo were examined by colony-formationassay, wound healing assay, transwell assay and nude mouse subcutaneous tumorformation model. The target gene of miR-8084 were predicted by TargetScan andmiRDB, and confirmed by luciferase reporter system. The roles of miR-8084 in the breast cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT) were investigated by MTS, FACS and associated-marker detection by westernblot.RESULTS: miR-8084 is significantly up-regulated in both serum and malignanttissues from the source of breast cancer patients. miR-8084 promotes theproliferation of breast cancer cells by activating ERK1/2 and AKT. MeanwhilemiR-8084 inhibits apoptosis by decreasing p53-BAX related pathway. miR-8084 also enhances migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Moreover, the tumor suppressorING2 is a potential target of miR-8084, and miR-8084 regulatory axes contributeto pro-tumor effect, at least partially through regulating ING2.CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest that miR-8084 functions as an oncogenethat promotes the development and progression of breast cancer, and miR-8084 is apotential new diagnostic marker and therapeutic target of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12967-018-1419-5 PMCID: PMC5824560PMID: 29471858
