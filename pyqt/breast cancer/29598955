The aim of this analysis was to evaluatethe influence of weight changes during adjuvant chemotherapy on outcome in alarge multicenter prospectively randomized trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ADEBAR trial compares a sequential chemotherapyconsisting of epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel to anepirubicin/5-fluorouracil/cyclophosphamide regimen in patients with lymphnode-positive early breast cancer. Body weight was measured before each cycle of chemotherapy. According to the relative weight change (≥ 5%) between the firstand the last cycle, patients were categorized into the weight gain, weight loss, or stable weight group. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival wereassessed by univariate Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses.RESULTS: Concise data from 1080 of 1493 participants who completed all cycles of chemotherapy were available for analysis. Of 307 patients (24.8%) whose weightchanged by ≥ 5%, 120 patients (11.1%) lost and 187 (17.3%) gained weight.Multivariate analysis showed a significant independent effect of weight change onOS (P = .039), but not on disease-free survival (P = .111). Both weight changegroups had a worse OS compared to patients with stable weight (weight gain:hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.40; P = .047; weight loss:hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.97-2.47; P = .067).CONCLUSION: Weight change of > 5% during adjuvant chemotherapy in patients withhigh-risk early breast cancer is associated with poor OS.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
