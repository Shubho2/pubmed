The purpose ofthis study is to clarify whether miR-96 is similarly associated with tumorinvasion in colorectal cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed western blotting to investigate theexpression of RECK when miR-96 mimics or inhibitors were transferred into HCT-116colorectal cancer cells. The RECK mRNA level was assessed by a reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction. An invasion assay was used to evaluatetumor invasion.RESULTS: The expression of RECK was inhibited by the transfection of miR-96mimics. RECK mRNA level was reduced by miR-96 mimics and increased by miR-96inhibitor. In the invasion assay, miR-96 mimics were shown to promote tumorinvasion.CONCLUSION: miR-96 may be associated with tumor invasion through inhibition ofRECK expression in colorectal cancer.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12442 PMID: 29599320  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
