Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is not the same disease asinvasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) as it has distinct biologic features and thusrequires unique consideration and research.METHODS: We selected women (≤50 years of age) from the Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database diagnosed with stage T1-2, N0-1, M0primary breast cancer with invasive lobular features between 1998 and 2011, that were treated with either BCT or mastectomy with and without radiation. Weassessed survival proportions using the Kaplan-Meier method and hazard ratiosusing Cox proportional hazards models. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS)served as the primary endpoint.RESULTS: A total of 3393 eligible young ILC patients were identified, 1391 (41%) of which underwent lumpectomy followed by radiation. The 10-year BCSS rates forpatients who received BCT, mastectomy alone and mastectomy with radiation were95.7%, 94.2% and 89.3%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that BCSS was not improved in patients assigned to mastectomy alone group (HR = 0.86; 95% CI0.57-1.28) or mastectomy with postsurgical radiation group (HR = 0.97; 95% CI0.58-1.62) compared to that in those who underwent BCT. The results did notchanged when evaluating the 1998-2004 and 2005-2011 time periods separately.CONCLUSION: None of the treatment demonstrated an absolute superiority in youngwomen with early-stage ILC. Future studies with more detailed analyses of theconfounding factors are worthwhile.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
