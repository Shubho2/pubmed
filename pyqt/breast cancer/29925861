In the aspect of metabolichomeostasis, therefore, the antiviral homeostasis-maintaining metabolites ofbacteria may possess anti-tumor activity. However, this issue has not beenaddressed. Here we show that the homeostasis-challenged maintaining metabolitesfrom deep-sea bacteriophage-challenged thermophile can suppress tumor metastasis.The results indicated that the metabolic profiles of the bacteriophageGVE2-infected and virus-free thermophile Geobacillus sp. E263 from a deep-seahydrothermal vent were remarkably different. Thirteen metabolites weresignificantly elevated and two metabolites were downregulated in thermophilestress response to GVE2 infection. As an example, the upregulated L-norleucinewas characterized. The data showed that L-norleucine had antiviral activity inthermophile. Furthermore, the in vitro and in vivo assays revealed thatL-norleucine, as well as its derivative, significantly suppressed metastasis ofgastric and breast cancer cells. L-norleucine interacted with hnRNPA2/B1 protein to inhibit the expressions of Twist1 and Snail, two inhibitors of E-cadherin, andpromote the E-cadherin expression, leading to the inhibition of tumor metastasis.Therefore, our study presented that antiviral homeostasis-maintaining metabolitesof microbes might be a promising source for anti-tumor drugs.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0376-z PMID: 29925861
