The aim of our study was to estimate of different CTCsubsets in breast cancer during the NACT (neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Theprospective study includes 27 patients with invasive breast cancer, T2-4N0-3M0,aged 32 to 60 years. Venous heparinized blood samples, taken before and afterbiopsy, after each courses of chemotherapy (on days 3-7), and before surgicalintervention, served as the material for this study. Different subsets ofcirculating tumor cells were determined on the basis of the expression of EpCAM, CD45, CD44, CD24, and N-Cadherin using flow cytometry. As the result of thisstudy, it has been observed that significant changes in the quantity of thedifferent subsets of circulating tumor cells in patients' blood were observedafter carrying out the 3rd course of NACT. NACT causes significant changes in thequantity of six CTC subsets, with various combinations of stemness andepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) properties.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23040727 PMID: 29565320
