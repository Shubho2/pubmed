Recent microwave breast imaging studies have shown how backscatteredsignals carry relevant information about the shape of a tumour, and tumour shape is often used with current imaging modalities to assess malignancy. This paperpresents a comprehensive analysis of microwave breast diagnosis systems which usemachine learning to learn characteristics of benign and malignant tumours. Thestate-of-the-art, the main challenges still to overcome and potential solutionsare outlined. Specifically, this work investigates the benefit of signalpre-processing on diagnostic performance, and proposes a new set of extractedfeatures that capture the tumour shape information embedded in a signal. Thiswork also investigates if a relationship exists between the antenna topology in amicrowave system and diagnostic performance. Finally, a careful machine learning validation methodology is implemented to guarantee the robustness of the results and the accuracy of performance evaluation.DOI: 10.3390/diagnostics8020036 PMCID: PMC6023429PMID: 29783760
