Therefore, we performed thisstudy to evaluate the qualitative image quality and quantitative ADC value ofreduced FOV DWI in patients with cervical cancer in comparison with conventional DWI.METHODS: This study retrospectively included 22 patients (mean age, 53.9 years)with biopsy-proven cervical cancer who underwent pelvic MR imaging includingconventional DWI and reduced FOV DWI before therapy. Two observers independently rated image quality for reduced FOV DWI and conventional DWI regarding anatomicdetail, lesion conspicuity, presence of artifacts, and overall image qualityusing the following 4-point scale. Quantitative analysis was performed bymeasuring the ADC value of the tumor. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used tocompare qualitative scores and mean ADC value between two DWI sequences.RESULTS: Reduced FOV DWI achieved significantly better anatomic detail, lesionconspicuity, presence of artifacts, and overall image quality compared toconventional DWI (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in mean tumorADC value between the two DWI sequences (0.990 × 10-3 mm2 s-1 ± 0.364 at reduced FOV DWI vs 1.253 × 10-3 mm2 s-1 ± 0.387 at conventional DWI) (p = 0.067).CONCLUSION: Reduced FOV DWI shows better image quality in terms of anatomicdetail and lesion conspicuity with fewer artifacts compared to conventional DWI. Advance in knowledge: Reduced FOV DWI may enhance diagnostic performance forevaluation of cervical cancer.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170864 PMID: 29630391  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
