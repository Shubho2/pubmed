Unfortunately, noapproved drugs are available for anti-metastatic treatment. In our study,high-throughput sequencing-based high-throughput screening (HTS2) and a breastcancer lung metastasis (BCLM)-associated gene signature were combined to discoveranti-metastatic drugs. After screening of thousands of compounds, we identifiedPonatinib as a BCLM inhibitor. Ponatinib significantly inhibited the migrationand mammosphere formation of breast cancer cells in vitro and blocked BCLM inmultiple mouse models. Mechanistically, Ponatinib represses the expression ofBCLM-associated genes mainly through the ERK/c-Jun signaling pathway byinhibiting the transcription of JUN and accelerating the degradation of c-Junprotein. Notably, JUN expression levels were positively correlated withBCLM-associated gene expression and lung metastases in breast cancer patients.Collectively, we established a novel approach for the discovery ofanti-metastatic drugs, identified Ponatinib as a new drug to inhibit BCLM andrevealed c-Jun as a crucial factor and potential drug target for BCLM. Our study may facilitate the therapeutic treatment of BCLM as well as other metastases.DOI: 10.1007/s13238-018-0533-8 PMID: 29667003
