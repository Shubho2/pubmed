Through microarrayanalysis and real-time PCR analysis we identified genes that were regulated byHER2-3'UTR. Positive and negative manipulation of miRNA expression, responseelement mutational studies and transcript reporter assays were performed toexplore the mechanism of competitive sequestration of miR125a/miRNA125b by HER23'UTR. To investigate if trastuzumab-induced upregulation of HER3 is alsomediated through miRNA de-repression, we used the CRISPR/cas9 to mutate theendogenous HER2 mRNA in HER2 over-expressing Au565 cells. Finally, we looked atcohorts of breast cancer samples of our own and the TCGA to show if HER2 and HER3mRNAs correlate with each other.RESULTS: The HER2 3'UTR pronouncedly promoted cell proliferation, colonyformation, and breast tumor growth. High-throughput sequencing revealed asignificant increase in HER3 mRNA and protein levels by the HER2 3'untranslatedregion (3'UTR). The HER2 3'UTR harboring a shared miR-125a/b response elementinduced miR-125a/b sequestration and thus resulted in HER3 mRNA derepression.Trastuzumab treatment upregulated HER3 via elevated HER2 mRNA expression, leadingto trastuzumab resistance. Depletion of miR-125a/b enhanced the antitumoractivity of trastuzumab. Microarray data from HER2-overexpressing primary breast cancer showed significant elevation of mRNAs for predicted miR-125a/b targetscompared to non-targets.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HER2 3'UTR-mediated HER3 upregulation is involved in breast cell transformation, increased tumor growth, and resistance toanti-HER2 therapy. The combinatorial targeting of HER3 mRNA or miR-125a/b mayoffer an effective tool for breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0862-5 PMID: 30068375
