These patients underwent further assessment toidentify biopsy proven mammographically occult breast tumors located more than2cm away from the edge of the primary tumor. Additional MRI characteristics ofthe primary and secondary tumors and pathology were reviewed. Statisticalanalysis was performed using SPSS (v. 24).RESULTS: Of 667 patients with breast cancer, 129 patients had 150 additionalipsilateral mammographically occult tumors that were more than 2cm away from the edge of the primary tumor. One hundred twelve of 129 (86.8%) patients had oneadditional tumor and 17/129 (13.2%) had two or more additional tumors. In 71/129 (55.0%), additional tumors were located in a different quadrant and in 58/129(45.0%) additional tumors were in the same quadrant but ≥2cm away. Overall,primary tumor size was significantly larger (mean 1.87± 1.25 cm) than theadditional tumors (mean 0.79 ± 0.61cm, p < 0.001). However, in 20/129 (15.5%) theadditional tumor was larger and in 26/129 (20.2%) the additional tumor was ≥1cm. The primary tumor was significantly more likely to be invasive (81.4%, 105/129)compared to additional tumors (70%, 105/150, p = 0.03). In 9/129 (7.0%) patients,additional tumors yielded unsuspected invasive cancer orhigher tumor grade. Theadditional tumor was more likely to be nonmass lesion type (37.3% vs 24%p = 0.02) and focus lesion type (10% vs 0.08%, p < 0.001) compared to primarytumor.CONCLUSION: Mammographically occult additional tumors identified more than 2cmaway from the primary breast tumor on MRI are unlikely to be surgically treatedif undiagnosed and may be clinically significant.Copyright © 2018 Academic Radiology.
