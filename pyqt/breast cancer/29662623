The process requires re-establishment of normal control mechanisms that are lost in cancer cells so that abnormal proliferation can be halted. Embryonicenvironments can reset cellular programmes and we previously showed that axolotl oocyte extracts can reprogram breast cancer cells and reverse theirtumorigenicity. In this study, we analysed the gene expression profiles of oocyteextract-treated tumour xenografts to show that tumour reprogramming involves cellcycle arrest and acquisition of a quiescent state. Tumour dormancy is associated with increased P27 expression, restoration of RB function and downregulation ofmitogen-activated signalling pathways. We also show that the quiescent state isassociated with increased levels of H4K20me3 and decreased H4K20me1, anepigenetic profile leading to chromatin compaction. The epigenetic reprogramming induced by oocyte extracts is required for RB hypophosphorylation and inductionof P27 expression, both occurring during exposure to the extracts and stablymaintained in reprogrammed tumour xenografts. Therefore, this study demonstrates the value of oocyte molecules for inducing tumour reversion and for thedevelopment of new chemoquiescence-based therapies.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24664 PMCID: PMC5882314PMID: 29662623
