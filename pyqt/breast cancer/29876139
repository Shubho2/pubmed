Given theresponsibility of primary care providers in counseling women in thisdecision-making process, it is important to understand their thoughts on thesecontroversies and how they manage uncertainty in their practice.Objective: To review the perspectives and approaches of primary care providersregarding mammography decision-making with average-risk women.Design and methods: This study is a critical interpretive review of peer-reviewliterature that reports primary care provider perspectives on mammographyscreening decision-making. Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid PsycInfo, and Scopus databaseswere searched with dates from 2002 to 2017 using search terms related tomammography screening, uncertainty, counseling, decision-making, and primaryhealth care providers.Results: Nine articles were included following a review process involving thethree authors. Using an inductive and iterative approach, data were grouped into four thematic categories: (1) perceptions on the effectiveness of screening,screening initiation age, and screening frequency; (2) factors guiding primarycare providers in the screening decision-making process, including both provider and patient-related factors, (3) uncertainty faced by primary care providersregarding guidelines and screening discussions with their patients; and (4)informed decision-making with average-risk women, including factors thatfacilitate and hinder this process.Discussion: The discussion of results addresses several factors about thediversity of perspectives and practices of physicians counseling average-riskwomen regarding breast cancer screening. This has implications for the challenge of understanding and explaining evidence, what should be shared with average-riskwomen considering screening, the forms of knowledge that physicians value toguide screening decision-making, and the consent process for population-basedscreening initiatives. Within the data, there was little attention placed on how physicians coped with uncertainty in practice. Given the dual responsibility ofphysicians in caring for both individuals and the larger population, furtherresearch should probe more deeply into how they balance their duties toindividual patients with those to the larger population they serve.DOI: 10.1186/s40985-018-0092-9 PMCID: PMC5978996PMID: 29876139
