China.Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in patients with breast cancer andlacks effective therapeutic agents. Oridonin, an active diterpenoid compoundisolated from Rabdosia rubescens, was identified to be the most potent anti-tumoringredient. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for its anti-metastaticeffects remain unclear. In the present study, oridonin significantly suppressedthe migration, invasion and adhesion of MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 breast cancer cells,and inhibited tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in adose-dependent manner. The expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT)-associated marker and the hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)/vascularendothelium growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway mRNA and proteins weredetermined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction andwestern blotting, respectively in vitro. The results demonstrated that oridonineffectively inhibited EMT as demonstrated by the significant increases in theexpression levels of E-cadherin, and decreased expression of N-cadherin, Vimentinand Snail. In addition, oridonin exerted its anti-angiogenesis activity throughsignificantly decreasing HIF-1α, VEGF-A and VEGF receptor-2 protein expression.Furthermore, oridonin was demonstrated to decrease the micro-vessel density asevidenced by the decreased expression of cluster of differentiation 31, a marker for neovasculature. In brief, oridonin inhibits tumor cell migration, invasionand adhesion, as well as tumor angiogenesis, which are mediated by suppressingEMT and the HIF-1α/VEGF signaling pathway. The results of the present studysuggest that oridonin may be a promising anti-metastatic agent in breast cancertreatment.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8943 PMCID: PMC6036431PMID: 30008931
