Case In June 2017, the Capecitabine for ResidualCancer as Adjuvant Therapy (CREATE-X) trial was published in the New EnglandJournal of Medicine. In this study, which suggested the post-surgery addition of capecitabine would improve survival of high-risk breast cancer patients, the costof capecitabine for off-label use was illegally claimed to the Japanese publichealth insurance system, rather than being covered by the research budget. Thisillegal claim led to the profit of more than 100,000,000 JPY (approximately 0.91 million USD) for Chugai Pharmaceutical Company (CPC), which manufacturescapecitabine. Additional evidence suggests that the CPC made donations of atleast 100,000,000 JPY (approximately 0.91 million USD) and 236,000,000 JPY(approximately 2.1 million USD) to the Japan Breast Cancer Research Group(JBCRG), the study's sponsor and funder where the majority of the Japaneseauthors served high-level positions, and the Advanced Clinical ResearchOrganization, the other study funder, respectively, during the study period,though the total amount has not been clarified. Neither the CPC's involvement norits undue profit was mentioned in the published article. Conclusion This casereport highlights the lack of financial transparency in the CREATE-X trial, anddiscusses the potential limitations that may exist in the current frameworks for disclosing financial ties between physicians and relevant industries in clinical trials. Achieving improved transparency is essential to heighten credibility inthe findings of clinical trials.DOI: 10.1007/s10637-018-0577-x PMID: 29516231
