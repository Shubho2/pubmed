In the present study, it was observedthat wogonin exerted an inhibitory effect on the lipopolysaccharide(LPS)‑enhanced invasiveness of MDA‑MB‑231 cells. In addition, wogonin inhibitedthe synthesis of interleukin‑8 (IL‑8) and matrix metallopeptidase‑9 (MMP‑9),which are critical for promoting invasiveness in MDA‑MB‑231 cells. Wogonin alsosuppressed the expression of leukotriene B4 receptor 2 (BLT2) and the synthesisof its ligand, by inhibiting 5‑lipoxygenase (5‑LO) in LPS‑stimulated MDA‑MB‑231cells. Notably, wogonin attenuated the production of IL‑8 and MMP‑9 by inhibitingthe BLT2/extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK)‑linked cascade. Finally,in vivo, LPS‑driven MDA‑MB‑231 cell metastasis was markedly suppressed by wogoninadministration. Overall, the present results suggested that wogonin inhibited the5‑LO/BLT2/ERK/IL‑8/MMP‑9 signaling cascade and demonstrated that this cascade maybe an important target through which wogonin exerts its anticancer effects inbreast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3776 PMID: 30015917
