The BREAST-Q questionnaire wasgiven to patients prior to surgery and at 1 and 2 years follow-up points.Capsular contracture was evaluated by Baker scale. Surgical outcomes along withthe changes in BREAST-Q score were analyzed over time.RESULTS: Complications were reported in only one case and after two years thecapsular contracture rates were acceptable (grade I: 65,2%; grade II: 32,6%;grade III 2,2%). At one year and two year follow-ups patients reported high ratesin the measures of overall satisfaction with breasts (72,5 and 73,7respectively), psychosocial well-being (78,4 and 78,6), sexual well-being (58,8and 59,4), physical well-being (77,6 and 80,6) and overall satisfaction withoutcome (75,7 and 79,7). A statistically significant increase in allBREAST-domains from the preoperative to the postoperative period was reported at one and two years follow-ups (p < 0,05).CONCLUSION: Following bilateral prophylactic NSM and immediate subcutaneousreconstruction with TiLoop®, patients demonstrated high levels of satisfactionand quality of life as measured by BREAST-Q. 2-years outcomes confirmed highpatient comfort with increased scores from the preoperative baseline level.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
