Electronicaddress: lcollado@ucm.es.Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that plays a role in calcium and phosphorushomeostasis. Recently, extensive research on its extraskeletal actions has linkedvitamin D deficiency to an increased risk of infection, diabetes mellitus types 1and 2, cardiovascular disease, obesity, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease,colon, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer and some neurological diseases. There are various mechanisms by which vitamin D influences the natural history ofcancer. These include the role of vitamin D in the induction of apoptosis,stimulation of cell differentiation, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferativeeffects and inhibition of angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. The aim of this review is to clarify the true role of vitamin D in the onset of breast cancer andevolution of the disease after treatment. A further aim is to suggest newresearch directions to identify indications and requirements for vitamin Dsupplementation in patients with breast cancer.Copyright © 2018.
