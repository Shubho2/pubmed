In the United States, it affects one in eight women during their lifespan. In breastcancer surgery, chronic pain can be developed from poorly managed acutepostoperative pain. The aim of the study was to use a safe, easy, and lesscomplicated method of regional block for reducing the postoperative pain aftermastectomy, which will reduce the incidence of chronic postmastectomy pain.Materials and Methods: Ninety adult female patients with American Society ofAnesthesiologists Physical Status I, II, and III were allocated randomly intothree groups: Group C had general anesthesia; Group B had ultrasound-guidedpectoral nerve block (PECS block) (28mL 0.25% bupivacaine+2mL normal saline) plusgeneral anesthesia; and Group M had ultrasound-guided PECS block (total 28 mL of Bupivacaine 0.25%+2mL of magnesium sulfat 50%) plus general anesthesia.Results: The intraoperative fentanyl (μg) used was significantly lower in Group B(110.4 ± 26.3) and Group M (108.7 ± 14.1) than in Group C (214.3 ± 20.1) and alsothe same as regards the total postoperative pethidine (mg) in Group C (220 ±25.5), Group B (100.6 ± 24.3), and Group M (52.3 ± 12.3). The Group M was theleast group suffered from postoperative pain at all times of measurement.Conclusion: The Group M was the least group suffered from postoperative pain atall times of measurement.DOI: 10.4103/aer.AER_37_18 PMCID: PMC6020587PMID: 29962613
