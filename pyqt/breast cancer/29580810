A mathematicalmethodology was introduced to quantify the tumor cell population carrying asecond hit.RESULTS: Copy neutral LOH was the most prevalent LOH mechanism in this cohort (BC69%, OC 67%). However, only 36% of BC and 47% of OC showed LOH in all cancerouscells. Somatic intragenic deletions and methylated subclones were also found incombination with (partial) loss of heterozygosity. Unequivocal deleterioussomatic point mutations were not identified in this cohort.CONCLUSION: Different mechanisms inactivating the wild type allele are presentwithin the same tumor sample at various extents. Results indicate thatBRCA1/2-linked breast and ovarian cancer cells are predominantly characterized byLOH, but harbor a complex combination of second hits at various frequencies.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
