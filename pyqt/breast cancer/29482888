Seventy-five TNBCs and135 HR-positive/HER-2-negative breast cancers were reviewed. Data fromconventional ultrasound, Doppler vascularity and elastography were included inthe analysis. TNBCs had a higher histologic grade and Ki-67 level. On ultrasound,TNBCs often appeared as microlobulated, markedly hypo-echoic masses with anabrupt interface boundary, posterior acoustic enhancement, absence ofcalcifications and more characteristics of surrounding tissue. Results frommultivariate regression analysis revealed that margin, posterior acousticfeatures and surrounding tissue features of tumors were independent predictivefactors in differentiating TNBCs from HR-positive/HER-2-negative tumors. Ourresults suggest that a thorough evaluation of sonographic findings might beuseful in discriminating between TNBCs and HR-positive/HER-2-negative tumors,which may provide accurate evidence for clinical early diagnosis.Copyright Â© 2018 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology.Published by Elsevier Inc.
