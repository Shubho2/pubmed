However, the link between MDSCs andglycolysis is unknown in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).Here, we detect abundant glycolytic activities in human TNBC. In two TNBC mousemodels, 4T1 and Py8119, glycolysis restriction inhibits tumor granulocytecolony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophagecolony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression and reduces MDSCs. These areaccompanied with enhanced T cell immunity, reduced tumor growth and metastasis,and prolonged mouse survival. Mechanistically, glycolysis restriction repressesthe expression of a specific CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPB) isoform,liver-enriched activator protein (LAP), via the AMP-activated protein kinase(AMPK)-ULK1 and autophagy pathways, whereas LAP controls G-CSF and GM-CSFexpression to support MDSC development. Glycolytic signatures that includelactate dehydrogenase A correlate with high MDSCs and low T cells, and areassociated with poor human TNBC outcome. Collectively, tumor glycolysisorchestrates a molecular network of the AMPK-ULK1, autophagy, and CEBPB pathways to affect MDSCs and maintain tumor immunosuppression.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.cmet.2018.04.022 PMID: 29805099
