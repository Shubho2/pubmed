At present, breast cancer is divided intomolecular subgroups besides its histopathological classification. Decision foradjuvant chemotherapy is made based on not only histopathological characteristicsbut also molecular and genomic characteristics using indices, guidelines andcalculators in early-stage breast cancer. Making a treatment plan through allthese prognostic and predictive methods according to risk categories aims atpreventing unnecessary or useless treatments. In this review, an attempt to make a general assessment of prognostic and predictive methods is made which may beused for planning individualized therapy and also the comments of the guidelines used by the oncologists worldwide on these methods.DOI: 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1354_17 PMCID: PMC5861467PMID: 29512598
