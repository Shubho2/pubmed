The secondary outcome was dispositional mindfulness. Enrollment, app utilization,and study completion are reported as feasibility objectives.METHODS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer ≤5 years (n = 112) were randomized toAMT (n = 57) or WC (n = 55), over 8 weeks, with 4 weeks of follow-up. Weconducted linear mixed effects models to examine group by observationinteractions on QOL and dispositional mindfulness at baseline, duringintervention (5-weeks), post-intervention (9-weeks), and follow-up (12-weekspost-baseline).RESULTS: Participants assigned to AMT reported higher QOL, compared with thoseassigned to WC, from baseline through follow-up t(258.40) = 3.09, P < 0.01, 95%CI [2.71, 11.90]. Participants assigned to AMT also reported higher dispositionalmindfulness, compared with those assigned to WC, from baseline through follow-up t(268.44) = 2.04, P = 0.04, 95% CI [0.01, 0.57]. App utilization data wasobtained from 34 participants. Fewer participants assigned to AMT completed allstudy assessments, compared with participants assigned to WC, (χ21  = 7.07,P = 0.008).CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest commercially available AMT may proffer some benefitto women seeking to enhance their QOL following breast cancer diagnosis.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4764 PMID: 29766596
