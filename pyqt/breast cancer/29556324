In the process of tumorigenesis, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)plays important roles, and the mTOR signaling pathway is aberrant in varioustypes of human cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breastcancer, prostate cancer, as well as others. However, the relationship betweenmiRNAs and the mTOR signaling pathway is indistinct. Herein, we not onlysummarize the progress of miRNAs and the mTOR signaling pathway in cancers, butalso highlight their role in the diagnosis and treatment in the clinic.DOI: 10.7150/jca.22119 PMCID: PMC5858488PMID: 29556324
