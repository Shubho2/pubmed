Here we provide acomprehensive review of the existing data on microRNAs in TNBC, their moleculartargets, a putative role in invasive progression with a particular emphasis onthe epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and acquisition of stem-cellproperties (CSC), regarded both as prerequisites for metastasis, and significancefor therapy.METHODS: PubMed and Medline databases were systematically searched for therelevant literature. 121 articles have been selected and thoroughly analysed.RESULTS: Several miRNAs associated with EMT/CSC and invasion were identified assignificantly (1) upregulated: miR-10b, miR-21, miR-29, miR-9, miR-221/222,miR-373 or (2) downregulated: miR-145, miR-199a-5p, miR-200 family, miR-203,miR-205 in TNBC. Dysregulation of miR-10b, miR-21, miR-29, miR-145, miR-200family, miR-203, miR-221/222 was reported of prognostic value in TNBC patients.CONCLUSION: Available data suggest that specific microRNA clusters might play an important role in biology of TNBC, understanding of which should assist diseaseprognostication and therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2689-2 PMCID: PMC6061037PMID: 29923083
