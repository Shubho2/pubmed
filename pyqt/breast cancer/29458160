Electronic address: umytwang@umac.mo.Due to the ability of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducingligand (TRAIL) to induce cancer cell apoptosis selectively, TRAIL has attractedsignificant interest in the treatment of cancer. However, although TRAIL triggersapoptosis in a broad range of cancer cells, most primary cancers are oftenintrinsically TRAIL-resistant, or can acquire resistance after TRAIL treatment,evocating new strategies to overcome TRAIL resistance. Gambogic acid (GA), anactive constituent of Garcinia Hanburyi (Teng Huang in Chinese), has been appliedfor thousands of years for medicinal uses, however, the potential effect of GA incombating cancer resistance remains poorly investigated. In this study, we found that GA could increase the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to TRAIL andenhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis. GA cooperated with TRAIL to decrease the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins and activate Bid (BH3 interacting-domain deathagonist) to promote the crosstalk of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signaling,rather than increasing the expression of TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5. Thesefindings may open a new window in the treatment of breast cancer using TRAIL incombination with GA.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
