Animal and molecular studieshave shown that triclosan exerts a wide range of adverse health effects at bothhigh (ppm) and low (ppb) concentrations. Since triclosan is of growing concern tohuman and environmental health, there is a need to improve extraction procedures and to study additional effects from triclosan exposure. In this study, we haveimproved triclosan extraction from breast milk by using salt (MgSO4) to reduceemulsion formation and increase water polarity and water (∼80%) to enhance theoverall extraction efficiency (∼3.5 fold). This extraction method was applied to breast milk samples collected from donors who i) recorded their use oftriclosan-containing personal care products and ii) provided matching infantstool samples. Of the participants who had detectable amounts of triclosan intheir breast milk, nine (75%) of them reported daily use of triclosan-containing personal care products. Levels of triclosan in breast milk were compared to thedonor's infant's fecal microbiome. We found that the bacterial diversity in thefecal microbiome of the infants exposed to breast milk with detectable triclosan levels differed compared to their peers exposed to milk containing non-detectableamounts. This finding implies that exogenous chemicals are impacting microbiomediversity.Published by Elsevier Ltd.DOI: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.03.186 PMCID: PMC5915298 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29635158  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
