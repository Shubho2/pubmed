The UPR is highly conserved and plays a key role in the maintenance of protein folding quality control and homeostasis. Incontrast to the classical reactive mode of UPR activation, recent studiesdescribe a hormone-activated anticipatory UPR. In this pathway, mitogenichormones, such as estrogen (E2), epidermal growth factor, and vascularendothelial growth factor rapidly activate the UPR in anticipation of a futureneed for increased protein folding capacity upon cell proliferation. Here, wefocus on this recently unveiled pathway of E2-estrogen receptor α (ERα) action.Notably, rapid activation of the anticipatory UPR pathway is essential forsubsequent activation of the E2-ERα regulated transcription program. Moreover,activation of the UPR at diagnosis is a powerful prognostic marker in ERαpositive breast cancer. Furthermore, in cells containing ERα mutations thatconfer estrogen independence and are common in metastatic breast cancer, the UPR is constitutively activated and linked to antiestrogen resistance. LethalERα-dependent hyperactivation of the anticipatory UPR represents a promisingtherapeutic approach exploited by a new class of small molecule ERα biomodulator.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00325 PMCID: PMC6013567PMID: 29963013
