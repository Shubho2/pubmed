Here we report a novel class of CTCs-CSV-positivemacrophage-like CTCs (ML-CTCs). This nomenclature was based on the fact that thisclass of CTCs can be captured from blood samples of gastrointestinal stromaltumors (GISTs) patients using either the macrophage marker CD68 or ourproprietary tumor-specific cell-surface vimentin (CSV) antibody 84-1; likewise,the captured ML-CTCs can be co-stained with both typical macrophage markers(CD14, CD68) and tumor cell markers (DOG-1, C-kit) but not CD45. Patients withmetastatic GIST had significantly greater numbers of ML-CTCs than patients withlocalized GIST or cancer-free blood donors (P<0.0001). Unexpectedly, the classic CSV positive CTCs was abundant in metastatic disease but failed to predict GISTmetastasis. Only CSV-positive ML-CTCs was able to serve as a solid and novelbiomarker for prediction of metastatic risk in GIST patients.DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1420450 PMCID: PMC5927484 [Available on 2019-01-08]PMID: 29721368
