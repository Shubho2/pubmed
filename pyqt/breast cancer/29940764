Our previous study identified that miR-129-5p suppressesproliferation and metastasis in breast cancer cells. Herein, we determined thatCBX4 is a miR-129-5p target gene. CBX4 is up-regulated in breast cancer tissuesand while its over-expression promotes cell proliferation, its knockdownsuppresses cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, CBX4 mediates miR-129-5p-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and negatively correlateswith the expression of miR-129-5p expression. These combined results suggest thatCBX4 is an oncogene in breast cancer cells, and that it may provide a noveltherapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.4149/neo_2018_170814N530 PMID: 29940764
