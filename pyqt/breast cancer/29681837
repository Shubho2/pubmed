She had visiteda local ophthalmology clinic first. She was diagnosed with conjunctivitis and wasprescribed antibacterial eye drops. The symptoms persisted in spite of treatment.She was then referred to our hospital. At her initial visit, the visual acuities were 0.6 in both eyes. A slit-lamp examination revealed bilateral shallowanterior chamber, and intraocular pressures of 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 16mm Hg in the left eye. There were no cells in the anterior chamber. Fundusexamination revealed bilateral annular choroidal detachment and serous retinaldetachment. Fluorescein angiography showed leakage of dye from the retinalpigment epithelium (RPE) and indocyanine green angiography showed focal choroidalhypoperfusion. Optical coherence tomography showed wavy RPE line and blurry thickchoroid. Systemic investigation by the physician demonstrated bilateral pleuraleffusions of unknown origin. The patient had a past history of breast cancer;however, no metastasis was identified via malignant cells through cytology,laboratory findings, radiographs, CT, and MRI. After the diagnosis ofVogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease was made, the patient was treated with localand systemic steroid including high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, and 150 mg of cyclosporine per day. Seventy days after the second high-dose of intravenouscorticosteroids, these medications brought a complete resolution of bothchoroidal and retinal detachment. VKH disease associated with SAPHO syndrome israre. The combination of immunosuppressive drug and steroid might be helpful for severe cases of VKH disease.DOI: 10.1159/000487226 PMCID: PMC5903130PMID: 29681837
