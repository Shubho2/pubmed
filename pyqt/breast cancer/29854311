Inappropriate expression or activation oftranscription factors in tumor breast microenvironment can lead to the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells. Bcl6 is a transcriptional factor that may play arole in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Moreover, cells surrounding tumorcells, including macrophages and mast cells play an important role during tumorprogression enhancing angiogenesis. We have demonstrated: 1) An increase of theBCL6 translocation and Bcl6 positive cells in G3 degree of disease; 2) Areduction of the expression of p53 in G3 breast cancer samples as compared toG1/G2 specimens; 3) Macrophages CD68+ and CD163+ in interstitial andperiglandular position, increase in G3 specimens as compared to G1/G2 and controlsamples; 4) Tryptase-positive mast cells in periglandular position are morenumerous in G3 tumor specimens as compared to G1/G2 and control samples. Overall,these data confirm the important role played by epigenetic events, including BCL6translocation, p53 expression, and microenvironment components, includingmacrophage and mast cell infiltration and microvascular density involved in theregulation of breast cancer progression.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25220 PMCID: PMC5978261PMID: 29854311
