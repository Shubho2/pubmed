At the same time, the Golgi is becoming well recognized as a hub that integrates its functions of protein and lipidbiosynthesis to signal transduction for cell proliferation and migration incancer cells. Nevertheless, the active function of the Golgi apparatus in cancer cells has not been fully evaluated as a target for combined treatment. Here, weanalyzed the effect of perturbing the Golgi apparatus on the sensitivity of theMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to the drugs Actinomycin D and Vinblastine. Wedisrupted the function of ARF1, a protein necessary for the homeostasis of theGolgi apparatus. We found that the expression of the ARF1-Q71L mutant increasedthe sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to both Actinomycin D and Vinblastine,resulting in decreased cell proliferation and cell migration, as well as inincreased apoptosis. Likewise, the combined treatment of cells with Actinomycin Dor Vinblastine and Brefeldin A or Golgicide A, two disrupting agents of the ARF1 function, resulted in similar effects on cell proliferation, cell migration andapoptosis. Interestingly, each combined treatment had distinct effects on ERK1/2 and AKT signaling, as indicated by the decreased levels of either phospho-ERK1/2 or phospho-AKT. Our results suggest that disruption of Golgi function could beused as a strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195401 PMCID: PMC5882166PMID: 29614107  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
