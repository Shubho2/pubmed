However, epidemiologic studies oncirculating melatonin are limited because melatonin is secreted at night, yetmost epidemiologic studies collect blood during the day when melatonin levels arevery low, and assays are lacking that are ultrasensitive to detect low levels of melatonin reliably.OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance of a refined radioimmunoassay in measuringmorning melatonin among women.METHODS: We used morning serum samples from 47 postmenopausal women ages 48-80years without a history of breast cancer who participated in the San FranciscoBay Area Breast Cancer Study, including 19 women who had duplicate measurements. The coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass coefficient (ICC) were estimatedusing the random effect model.RESULTS: Reproducibility for the assay was satisfactory, with a CV of 11.2% andan ICC of 98.9%; correlation between the replicate samples was also high (R =0.96). In the 47 women, serum melatonin levels ranged from 0.6 to 62.6 pg/ml,with a median of 7.0 pg/ml.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that it is possible to reliably measure melatoninin postmenopausal women in morning serum samples in large epidemiologic studiesto evaluate the role of melatonin in cancer etiology or prognosis.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195666 PMCID: PMC5895067PMID: 29641614  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
