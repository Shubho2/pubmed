However, resistance to trastuzumab-based therapyremains a major clinical problem for women with HER2+ breast cancer. Breastcancer stem cells (BCSCs) are suggested to be responsible for drug resistance andtumor recurrence. Notch signaling has been shown to promote BCSC survival andself-renewal. Trastuzumab-resistant cells have increased Notch-1 expression.Notch signaling drives cell proliferation in vitro and is required for tumorrecurrence in vivo. We demonstrate herein a mechanism by which Notch-1 isrequired for trastuzumab resistance by repressing PTEN expression to contributeto activation of ERK1/2 signaling. Furthermore, Notch-1-mediated inhibition ofPTEN is necessary for BCSC survival in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition ofMEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells mimicseffects of Notch-1 knockdown on bulk cell proliferation and BCSC survival. These findings suggest that Notch-1 contributes to trastuzumab resistance by repressingPTEN and this may lead to hyperactivation of ERK1/2 signaling. Furthermore, high Notch-1 and low PTEN mRNA expression may predict poorer overall survival in womenwith breast cancer. Notch-1 protein expression predicts poorer survival in women with HER2+ breast cancer. These results support a potential future clinical trialcombining anti-Notch-1 and anti-MEK/ERK therapy for trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0251-y PMID: 29743588
