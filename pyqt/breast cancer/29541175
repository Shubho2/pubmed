China.MicroRNA-32 (miR-32) is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis incertain malignant tumors. However, the function and clinical relevance of miR-32 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the expression and prognostic value of miR-32 fromliver samples in patients with HCC. The expression of miR-32 was analyzed in HCC and healthy tissues using Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze thelevels of miR-32 mRNA in 154 HCC liver samples, 33 of which were paired withadjacent non-tumor tissues. The overall survival (OS) rate in patients with HCCwas evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and the factors that mayaffect the prognosis and survival of patients with HCC were analyzed usingunivariate (log-rank test) and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Thepresent results demonstrated that miR-32 expression levels were significantlyupregulated in HCC liver biopsies compared with normal tissues (P<0.05). miR-32expression was significantly associated with the number of foci and tumordiameter (P<0.05). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients withlow miR-32 expression had longer OS and disease-free survival compared with thosewith high miR-32 expression (P<0.01). Altogether, to the best our knowledge, the present study is the first study to indicate the association between increasedmiR-32 expression with HCC progression and poor prognosis in patients. Thissuggests that miR-32 may have potential prognostic value and may be used as atumor biomarker for the diagnosis of patients with HCC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7879 PMCID: PMC5835914PMID: 29541175
