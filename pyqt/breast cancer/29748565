Chris.Lord@icr.ac.uk.Although PARP inhibitors (PARPi) target homologous recombination defectivetumours, drug resistance frequently emerges, often via poorly understoodmechanisms. Here, using genome-wide and high-density CRISPR-Cas9"tag-mutate-enrich" mutagenesis screens, we identify close to full-length mutant forms of PARP1 that cause in vitro and in vivo PARPi resistance. Mutations bothwithin and outside of the PARP1 DNA-binding zinc-finger domains cause PARPiresistance and alter PARP1 trapping, as does a PARP1 mutation found in a clinicalcase of PARPi resistance. This reinforces the importance of trapped PARP1 as acytotoxic DNA lesion and suggests that PARP1 intramolecular interactions mightinfluence PARPi-mediated cytotoxicity. PARP1 mutations are also tolerated incells with a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation where they result in distinctsensitivities to chemotherapeutic drugs compared to other mechanisms of PARPiresistance (BRCA1 reversion, 53BP1, REV7 (MAD2L2) mutation), suggesting that the underlying mechanism of PARPi resistance that emerges could influence the successof subsequent therapies.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03917-2 PMCID: PMC5945626PMID: 29748565
