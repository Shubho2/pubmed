In present study, lncRNA CASC2 was found to be significantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissues and celllines. We got this point with the quantitative real time-PCR. Furthermore,gain-of-function assays demonstrated that overexpression of lncRNA CASC2significantly repressed proliferation and metastasis while caused cell cyclearrest and much more early apoptosis of breast cancer. Additionally, based on theabove research, we illustrated that the inactivation of TGF-ß signal pathway was involved in the function of lncRNA CASC2. Collectively, lncRNA CASC2 was a keyfactor in the tumorigenesis and malignancy of breast cancer, thereby possibly wasa potential therapy target for the treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3727/096504018X15199531937158 PMID: 29523222
