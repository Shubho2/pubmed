Theaccumulation of cancer molecular profiling and drug response data providesopportunities and challenges to identify novel molecular signatures andmechanisms of tumor responsiveness to drugs. This study evaluated drug responses with a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) system that depended on competitionbetween diverse RNA species. We identified drug response-related ceRNA (DRCEs) bycombining the sequence and expression data of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA),microRNA (miRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA), and the survival data of cancerpatients treated with drugs. We constructed a patient-drug two-layer integratednetwork and used a linear weighting method to predict individual drug responses. DRCEs were found to be significantly enriched in known cancer and drug-associateddata resources, involved in biological processes known to mediate drug responses,and correlated to drug activity in cancer cell lines. The dysregulation of DRCEexpression influenced drug response-associated functions and pathways, suggestingDRCEs as potential therapeutic targets affecting drug responses. A further casestudy in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) found that DRCE expression wasconsistent with the drug response pattern and the aberrant expression of the two NEAT1-related DRCEs may lead to poor response to tamoxifen therapy for patientswith TP53 mutations. In summary, this study provides a framework for ceRNA-based evaluation of clinical drug responses across multiple cancer types. Understandingthe underlying molecular mechanisms of drug responses will allow improvedresponse to chemotherapy and outcomes of cancer treatment.Â© 2018 The Authors.
