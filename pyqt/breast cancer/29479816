Olaparib, a highly potent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has been shown to sensitize many types of tumor to radiotherapy.However, the effect of olaparib, either as monotherapy or as combination therapy with radiotherapy, on CCA is not known, and our study aimed to explore this. Toassess radiosensitization in three CCA cell lines (QBC939, HuH28 and TFK-1),viability and clonogenic assays were conducted. The absorbed radiation doses were0 Gy, 2 Gy, 4 Gy, and 6 Gy; olaparib concentrations were 0 nmol/L, 1 nmol/L,10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, 1000 nmol/L, 2500 nmol/L, 5000 nmol/L and 10 000 nmol/L.The mechanism of olaparib radiosensitization was explored by Western blotting.Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry were conducted to explore DNAdamage and apoptosis. The radiosensitivity of CCA cells was enhanced by olaparib,which alone had little effect on the CCA cell lines without BRCA mutations. Thedegree of radiosensitization increased with increasing doses of olaparib byviability and clonogenic assays in vitro. Olaparib was able to enhance the effectof radiation by inhibiting PARP1, inducing DNA lesions and apoptosis. Thesefindings emphasize the role of olaparib in the radiosensitization of CCA cells.© 2018 The Authors.
