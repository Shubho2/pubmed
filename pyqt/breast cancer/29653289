Misoriented cell division underlies many important diseases, suchas cancer. Studies with Drosophila and C. elegance models show that Src, aproto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase, is a critical regulator of this aspect ofmitosis. However, the role for Src in controlling cell division orientation inmammalian cells is not well understood. Using genetic and pharmacologicalapproaches and two extracellular signals to orient cell division, we demonstrateda critical role for Src. Either knockout or pharmacological inhibition of Srcwould retain the fidelity of cell division orientation with the long-axisorientation of mother cells. Conversely, re-expression of Src would decouple celldivision orientation from the pre-division orientation of the long axis of mothercells. Cell division orientation in human breast and gastric cancer tissuesshowed that the Src activation level correlated with the degree of mitoticspindle misorientation relative to the apical surface. Examination of proteinsassociated with cortical actin revealed that Src activation regulated theaccumulation and local density of adhesion proteins on the sites of cell-matrixattachment. By analyzing division patterns in the cells with or without Srcactivation and through use of a mathematical model, we further support ourfindings and provide evidence for a previously unknown role for Src in regulatingcell division orientation in relation to the pre-division geometry of mothercells, which may contribute to the misoriented cell division.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
