The present study investigated the effect of glyphosate onthe estrogen signaling pathway involved in the induction of cholangiocarcinoma(CCA) cell growth. HuCCA-1, RMCCA-1 and MMNK-1 were chosen for comparison. Theeffects of glyphosate on cell growth, cell cycle and molecular signaling pathwayswere measured. The results showed that HuCCA-1 cells expressed estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), while ERα was not detected in RMCCA-1 and MMNK-1 cells. ERα wasmostly expressed in cytoplasmic compartment of HuCCA-1 cells. Estradiol (E2)(10-11-10-5 M) induced cell proliferation in HuCCA-1 but not in RMCCA-1 andMMNK-1 cells. Glyphosate at the same concentration range also inducedHuCCA-1 cell proliferation. The S phase of the cell cycle, and protein levels of the cyclin family were significantly increased after treatment of glyphosate orE2. Both compounds also induced the expression of proliferative signaling-relatedproteins including ERα, VEGFR2, pERK, PI3K(p85), and PCNA. These effects ofglyphosate and E2 were abolished by the ER antagonist, 4-hydroxytamoxifen andU0126, a MEK inhibitor. The data from this study indicate that glyphosate caninduce cell growth in ERα positive CCA cells through non-genomic estrogenreceptor/ERK1/2 signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
