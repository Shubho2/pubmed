We examined ourinstitution's practice with this patient subset.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-institution retrospective chart review wasperformed on patients 70 years and older with T1N0M0, estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and who underwent BCT between April 2010 and October 2015.RESULTS: A total of 123 patients met inclusion criteria: 46% received RT and 73% received ET. The ET group had a mean age of 76.2 years, whereas the non-ET group had a mean age of 80.2 years (P = .00006). Race did not influence if patientsreceived ET (P = .4). In patients who received ET, mean age at time of diagnosis for those that completed 5 years of therapy was 75.5 years, whereas those whostopped therapy early had a mean age of 77.6 years (P = .053). In patients whoreceived ET but stopped early, reasons for cessation included side-effect profile(67%), death (22%), and noncompliance (11%). Of the 27% of patients that did not receive ET, 62% were not offered therapy, 24% refused, and 14% were lost topostoperative follow-up.CONCLUSION: Increasing age showed significant association to not receive ET.Contraindication to ET and provider's assessment of minimal benefit are the most common reasons why patients are not prescribed ET. If patients are non-compliant with ET, RT should be reconsidered.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.07.004 PMID: 30072192
