Canada.RM-133 belongs to a new family of aminosteroid derivatives demonstratinginteresting anticancer properties, as confirmed in vivo in four mouse cancerxenograft models. However, the metabolic stability of RM-133 needs to beimproved. After investigation, the replacement of its androstane scaffold by amore stable estrane scaffold led to the development of the mestranol derivativeRM-581. Using solid-phase strategy involving five steps, we quickly synthesized aseries of RM-581 analogs using the recently-developed diethylsilyl acetyleniclinker. To establish structure-activity relationships, we then investigated theirantiproliferative potency on a panel of cancer cell lines from various cancers(breast, prostate, ovarian and pancreatic). Some of the mestranol derivativeshave shown in vitro anticancer activities that are close to, or better than thoseobserved for RM-581. Compound 23, a mestranol derivative having a((3,5-dimethylbenzoyl)-L-prolyl)piperazine side chain at position C2, was foundto be active as an antiproliferative agent (IC50 = 0.38 ± 0.34 to 3.17 ± 0.10 µM)and to be twice as active as RM-581 on LNCaP, PC-3, MCF-7, PANC-1 and OVCAR-3cancer cells (IC50 = 0.56 ± 0.30, 0.89 ± 0.63, 1.36 ± 0.31, 2.47 ± 0.91 and 3.17 ± 0.10 µM, respectively). Easily synthesized in good yields by both solid-phaseorganic synthesis and classic solution-phase chemistry, this promising candidate could be used as an antiproliferative agent on a variety of cancers, notablypancreatic and ovarian cancers, both having very bad prognoses.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180307130158 PMID: 29521249
