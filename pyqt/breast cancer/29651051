Understanding the underlying biology is essential for the design ofeffective targeted therapies. We previously reported that collagen IV α1/α2overexpression in non-metastatic lung carcinoma (M27colIV) cells increased their metastatic ability, specifically to the liver and documented high collagen IVlevels in surgical resections of liver metastases from diverse tumor types. Here,we aimed to elucidate the functional relevance of collagen IV to metastaticoutgrowth in the liver. Gene expression profiling revealed in M27colIVcellssignificant increases in the expression of chemokines CCL5 (5.7-fold) and CCL7(2.6-fold) relative to wild-type cells, and this was validated by qPCR andwestern blotting. Similarly, in human colon carcinoma KM12C and KM12SM cells withdivergent liver-colonizing potentials, CCL7 and CCL5 production correlated withtype IV collagen expression and the metastatic phenotype. CCL7 silencing by shorthairpin RNA (shRNA) reduced experimental liver metastasis in both cell types,whereas CCL5 silencing reduced metastasis of M27colIV cells, implicating thesecytokines in metastatic expansion in the liver. Subsequent functional analysesimplicated both MEK/ERK and PI3K signaling upstream of CCL7 upregulation andidentified CCL7 (but not CCL5) as a critical migration/invasion factor, actingvia the chemokine receptor CCR3. Chemokine CCL5 was identified as a regulator of the T-cell immune response in the liver. Loss of CCL7 in KM12SM cells was alsoassociated with altered E-cadherin and reduced vimentin and Snail expression,implicating it in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in these cells. Moreover, in clinical specimens of colon cancer liver metastases analyzed byimmunohistochemistry, CCL5 and CCL7 levels paralleled those of collagen IV. Theresults identify the chemokines CCL5 and CCL7 as type IV collagen-regulated genesthat promote liver metastasis by distinct and complementary mechanisms.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0242-z PMID: 29651051
