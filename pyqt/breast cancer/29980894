[Epub ahead ofprint]A phase 1, first-in-human study of AMG 900, an orally administered pan-Aurorakinase inhibitor, in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.Carducci M(1), Shaheen M(2), Markman B(3), Hurvitz S(4), Mahadevan D(2), Kotasek D(5), Goodman OB Jr(6), Rasmussen E(7), Chow V(7), Juan G(7), Friberg GR(7),Gamelin E(7), Vogl FD(7), Desai J(8).Author information: (1)Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, 1M59 BuntingBlaustein Cancer Research Building, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD, 21287,USA.

Dose escalation evaluated the safety,tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of AMG 900 in advanced solid tumors anddetermined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with/without granulocytecolony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis. Dose expansion evaluated clinical activity in three tumor types: taxane- and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer,taxane-resistant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and castration-resistantand taxane- or cisplatin/etoposide-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). AMG 900 was administered 4 days on/10 days off at 1-50 mg/day during escalation and at theMTD with G-CSF during expansion. Results AMG 900 showed rapid absorption withfast clearance, supporting once-daily dosing. The MTD was 25 mg/day, increasingto 40 mg/day with G-CSF. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events includedneutropenia (37%), anemia (23%), leukopenia (14%), and thrombocytopenia (12%).During dose expansion, 3/29 (10.3%, 95% CI: 2.0%-28.0%) evaluable patients withovarian cancer experienced partial response by central imaging per RECIST 1.1;median duration of response was 24.1 weeks (95% CI: 16.1-34.1). Seven patients(24.1%, 95% CI: 10.3%-43.5%) experienced partial response per Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup criteria; 5/9 patients positive for p53 expression responded totreatment. No objective responses were observed in patients with TNBC or CRPC perRECIST 1.1. Conclusions AMG 900 40 mg/day with G-CSF had manageable toxicity and demonstrated single-agent activity in patients with heavily pretreated,chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10637-018-0625-6 PMID: 29980894
