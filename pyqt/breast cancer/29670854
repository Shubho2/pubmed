Data suggests that there is not a threshold forthe deleterious effects from radiation on the heart. Over the past several years,advances in radiation delivery techniques have reduced cardiac morbidity due totreatment. Deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) is a technique that takesadvantage of a more favorable position of the heart during inspiration tominimize heart doses over a course of radiation therapy. In the accompanyingreview article, we outline several methods used to deliver treatment with DIBH,quantify the benefits of DIBH treatment, discuss considerations for patientselection, and identify challenges associated with DIBH techniques.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00087 PMCID: PMC5893752PMID: 29670854
