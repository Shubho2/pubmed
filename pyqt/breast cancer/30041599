Whether other proliferation markers, like Cyclin D1, and mitotic count can also be used to identify those estrogen receptor α (ERα)positive breast cancer patients that derive benefit from tamoxifen is not wellestablished. We tested the predictive value of these markers for tamoxifenbenefit in ERα positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients.METHODS: We collected primary tumor blocks from 563 ERα positive patients who hadbeen randomized between tamoxifen (1 to 3 years) vs. no adjuvant therapy (IKAtrial) with a median follow-up of 7.8 years. Mitotic count, Ki67 and Cyclin D1protein expression were centrally assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissuemicroarrays. In addition, we tested the predictive value of CCND1 gene copynumber variation using MLPA technology. Multivariate Cox proportional hazardmodels including interaction between marker and treatment were used to test thepredictive value of these markers.RESULTS: Patients with high Ki67 (≥5%) as well as low (< 5%) expressing tumorsequally benefitted from adjuvant tamoxifen (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.5 forboth groups)(p for interaction 0.97). We did not observe a significantinteraction between either Cyclin D1 or Ki67 and tamoxifen, indicating that therelative benefit from tamoxifen was not dependent on the level of these markers. Patients with tumors with low mitotic count derived substantial benefit fromtamoxifen (adjusted HR 0.24, p <  0.0001), while patients with tumors with highmitotic count derived no significant benefit (adjusted HR 0.64, p = 0.14) (p for interaction 0.03).CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal breast cancer patients with high Ki67 counts dosignificantly benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen, while those with high mitoticcount do not. Mitotic count is a better selection marker for reduced tamoxifenbenefit than Ki67.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4516-1 PMCID: PMC6057037PMID: 30041599
