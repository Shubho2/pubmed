Retrospective clinical studies havesuggested that use of regional anesthesia leads to improved patient outcomes.Laboratory studies have reported that breast cancer cells are inhibited by somelocal anesthetics at millimolar concentration. Here, we present a comprehensiveanalysis of the effects of six common local anesthetics on two human breastcancer cell lines. We used concentrations ranging from those corresponding toplasma levels during regional block by local anesthetic (plasma concentration) tothose corresponding to direct infiltration of local anesthetic.METHODS: Human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7, were incubated witheach of six local anesthetics (lidocaine, mepivacaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and chloroprocaine) (10 μM ~ 10 mM) for 6 to 72 h. Assays forcell viability, cytotoxicity, migration, and cell cycle were performed.RESULTS: High concentrations (> 1 mM) of local anesthetics applied to eitherMDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells for 48 h significantly inhibited cell viability andinduced cytotoxicity. At plasma concentrations (~ 10 μM) for 72 h, none of thelocal anesthetics affected cell viability or migration in either cell line.However, at 10 × plasma concentrations, 72-h exposure to bupivacaine,levobupivacaine or chloroprocaine inhibited the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells by > 40% (p < 0.001). Levobupivacaine also inhibited the viability of MCF7 cells by 50% (p < 0.001). None of the local anesthetics affected the viability of anon-cancerous breast cell line, MCF10A. MDA-MB-231 cell migration was inhibitedby 10 × plasma concentrations of levobupivacaine, ropivacaine or chloroprocaineand MCF7 cell migration was inhibited by mepivacaine and levobupivacaine(p < 0.05). Cell cycle analysis showed that the local anesthetics arrestMDA-MB-231 cells in the S phase at both 1 × and 10 × plasma concentrations.CONCLUSIONS: Local anesthetics at high concentrations significantly inhibitedbreast cancer cell survival. At 10 × plasma concentrations, the effect of localanesthetics on cancer cell viability and migration depended on the exposure time,specific local anesthetic, specific measurement endpoint and specific cell line.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4576-2 PMCID: PMC6006780PMID: 29914426
