The expression of CD4, programmed cell deathprotein 1 (PD-1), CK7, CK20, E-cadherin, or Ki-67 was detected byimmunohistochemistry. The associations between CD4+/PD-1+ or CD4+/PD-1-tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and pathological characteristics were evaluated.Results: Elderly patients intended to have a lower level of CD4+/PD-1-tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (p < 0.05). Patients with positive E-cadherinexpression had higher median cell counts of CD4+/PD-1- tumor-infiltratinglymphocytes than patients with negative E-cadherin expression (30/HPF versus10/HPF, p < 0.05). Counts of CD4+/PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes had asignificant correlation with Ki-67 index that the correlation coefficient was0.29 (p = 0.001). Positive CK20 expression was related to a higher level ofCD4+/PD-1- tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes than negative CK20 expression (73/HPFversus 30/HPF, p < 0.05).Conclusion: CD4+/PD-1+ or CD4+/PD-1- tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes showeddiverse association with pathological features of breast cancer. CD4+/PD-1+tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes had a significant relationship with Ki-67expression whereas CD4+/PD-1- tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes had a significantrelationship with E-cadherin expression. Further studies are warranted to explorethe immunomodulatory effects of phenotypes of CD4+ T cell subsets in breastcancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/5690258 PMCID: PMC6057338PMID: 30069490
