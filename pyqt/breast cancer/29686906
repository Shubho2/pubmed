While surgical staginghas traditionally dictated indications for postmastectomy radiation therapy(PMRT), our current understanding of tumor biology, host, immunoprofiles, andtumor microenvironment may direct a more personalized approach to radiation.Understanding the interaction of these variables may permit individualization of adjuvant therapy aimed at appropriate escalation and deescalation, includingrecommendations for PMRT. This article summarizes the current data regardingtumor and host molecular biomarkers in vitro and in vivo that support theindividualization of PMRT and discusses open questions that may alter the future of breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1155/2018/1402824 PMCID: PMC5852902PMID: 29686906
