Although tumor antigen-pulsed dendritic cell can improve anti-tumorimmune responses, tumor associated regulatory dendritic cells are involved in theinduction of immune tolerance. The current study sought to investigate whetherexosomes produced by tumor cells had any effect on DCs in immune suppression. In this study, we examined the effect of tumor exosomes on DCs and found thatexosomes from LLC Lewis lung carcinoma or 4T1 breast cancer cell blocked thedifferentiation of myeloid precursor cells into CD11c+ DCs and induced cellapoptosis. Tumor exosome treatment inhibited the maturation and migration of DCs and promoted the immune suppression of DCs. The treatment of tumor exosomesdrastically decreased CD4+IFN-γ+ Th1 differentiation but increased the rates ofregulatory T (Treg) cells. The immunosuppressive ability of tumor exosome-treatedDCs were partially restored with PD-L1 blockage. These data suggested that PD-L1 played a role in tumor exosome-induced DC-associated immune suppression.Copyright © 2018 European Federation of Immunological Societies. Published byElsevier B.V.
