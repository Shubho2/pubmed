China.Tamoxifen (TAM) resistance has become a severe problem for endocrine therapy ofbreast cancer. The present study investigated the association between microRNA(miRNA) expression and TAM resistance in breast cancer. The TAM-resistant breast cancer MCF-7C and MCF-7T cell lines were established using the human breastcancer cell line MCF-7 as the parental cell line and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) as the screening drug in vitro. The MCF-7C cell line was established by dosestepwise induction beginning with a low concentration of OHT; the MCF-7T cellline was established by temporal stepwise induction beginning with a highconcentration of OHT. Differential miRNA expression profiles betweenTAM-sensitive (MCF-7) and TAM-resistant (MCF-7C and MCF-7T) breast cancer celllines were detected and analyzed using RNA sequencing technology. The results of western blot analysis indicated that the level of ERÎ± protein expression indrug-resistant cells was significantly increased. A total of 1,646 miRNAs weredetected in all samples, including 1,376 known miRNAs and 270 predicted miRNAs.There were 118 miRNAs expressed at significantly different levels between MCF-7C and MCF-7 cells (P<0.05); among them, 67 miRNAs were upregulated (P<0.05) and 51 miRNA were downregulated (P<0.05). There were 42 miRNAs expressed atsignificantly different levels between MCF-7T and MCF-7 (P<0.05); among them, 23 miRNAs were upregulated (P<0.05) and 19 miRNAs were downregulated (P<0.05). Therewere 126 miRNAs with significant differences between MCF-7C and MCF-7T (P<0.05); among them, 76 miRNAs were upregulated (P<0.05) and 50 miRNAs were downregulated.On the basis of the results of the present study, we hypothesize that miR-21,miR-146a, miR-148a, miR-34a and miR-27a may serve important roles in mediatingTAM resistance in breast cancer, and have potential as therapeutic targets forTAM-resistant breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7768 PMCID: PMC5796357PMID: 29467872
