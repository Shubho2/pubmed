Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is amajor immune regulatory cytokine with a great impact and dual role ingastrointestinal carcinogenesis. In this context, the aim of the study was toexplore the role of circulating TGF-β1 and the -509C/T functional promoterpolymorphism (rs1800469) within the TGF-β1 gene (TGFB1) in the susceptibility,progression, and prognosis of CRC among Bulgarian male and female patients.Patients with sporadic CRC and healthy controls were genotyped bypolymerase-chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Serum TGF-β1 levels before and after curative surgery were determined by ELISA. Total RNA was extracted from paired tumor, normal mucosa and distant metastasis samples and wasused for quantitative detection of TGFB1 mRNA by TaqMan qPCR.We observed thatTGF-β1 serum levels depend on the -509C/T genotype in combination with gender.TGF-β1 serum levels in CRC patients were decreased compared to controls, butstatistical significance was reached only for men. In the stratified analysis by gender and genotype, a significant association was found for the CC genotype.Overall, our results indicate that the -509C allele increased the cancer risk,particularly for advanced stages (OR = 1.477; p = 0.029). The results from therelative mRNA quantification showed a significant upregulation of TGFB1 indistant metastases compared to primary tumor tissues and higher TGFB1 mRNA levelsin men (RQ = 4.959; p = 0.022). In conclusion, we present data that diminishedcirculating TGF-β1 due to the CC genotype could be a possible risk factor fortumor susceptibility and progression. This association is more pronounced inmales than in females.
