In this paper, weintroduce, calibrate, and verify a novel image-driven reaction-diffusion model ofavascular tumor growth. The model allows for proliferation, death and spread oftumor cells, and accounts for nutrient distribution and hypoxia. It isconstrained by longitudinal time series of dynamic contrast-enhancement-MRIimages. Tumor specific parameters are estimated from two early time points andused to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of the tumor volume and celldensities at later time points. We first test our parameter estimation approachon synthetic data from 15 generated tumors. Our in silico study resulted in smallvolume errors (<5%) and high Dice overlaps (>97%), showing that model parameters can be successfully recovered and used to accurately predict the tumor growth.Encouraged by these results, we apply our model to seven pre-clinical cases ofbreast carcinoma. We are able to show promising preliminary results, especiallyfor the estimation for early time points. Processes like angiogenesis andapoptosis should be included to further improve predictions for later timepoints.DOI: 10.1109/TMI.2017.2779811 PMID: 29533893
