We performed bioinformatics analysis to investigate whether CD24 can serve as aprognostic indicator in breast cancer.METHODS: CD24 expression was assessed using SAGE Genie tools and Oncomineanalysis. The PrognoScan database, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, and bc-GenExMiner wereused to identify the prognostic roles of CD24 in breast cancer.RESULTS: We found that CD24 was more frequently overexpressed in breast cancerthan in normal breast tissue and correlated with worse prognosis. Meanwhile, highCD24 expression was associated with increased risk of HER2, basal-like,triple-negative breast cancer, and higher Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grade. Datamining in multiple big databases confirmed a positive correlation between CD24mRNA expression and SDC1 mRNA expression in breast cancer tissue.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CD24 overexpression is more common inbreast cancer than in corresponding normal tissue. In addition, CD24 and SDC1 canserve as prognostic indicators for breast cancer. However, large-scale andcomprehensive research is needed to further confirm these results.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
