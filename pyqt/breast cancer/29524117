This research constructed a biomechanical FE model for breastshaped phantoms used to develop and validate a mechanical vibration basedscreening system. Such models do not currently exist but would enhancedevelopment of this screening technology. Three phantoms were modelled: healthy, with 10 and 20Â mm inclusions. The overall goal was to create models with enoughaccuracy to replace experimental phantoms in providing data to optimizediagnostic algorithms for digital image-based elasto-tomography (DIET) screening technologies. FE model results were validating against experimental DIET phantom data for over 4000 collected points on each model and phantom usingcross-correlation coefficients between experimental simulated data and directcomparison. Results showed good to strong correlation ranging from 0.7 to 1.0 in all cases with over 90% having a value over 0.9. Magnitudes for each frame of thedynamic response also matched well, indicating that the material properties andgeometry were accurate enough to provide this level of correlation. These resultsjustify the use of FE model generated data for in silico diagnostic algorithmdevelopment testing. The overall modelling and validation approach is not overly complex, and thus generalizable to similar problems using mechanical propertiesof silicone phantoms, and might be extensible to human cases with further work.Graphical abstract Validate that dynamic displacements show that the model can beused in place of phantoms for rapid development of diagnostic algorithms that usesurface motion to detect underlying mechanical properties.DOI: 10.1007/s11517-018-1804-5 PMID: 29524117
