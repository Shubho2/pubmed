Around 90% ofEHEs are caused by the fusion of Transcriptional Co-activator with a PDZ-motif(TAZ) with Calmodulin Binding Transcription Activator 1 (CAMTA1), a centralnervous system-specific transcription activator. The 10% of EHEs that lack theTAZ⁻CAMTA1 fusion instead have a fusion of Yes-associated Protein (YAP) andTranscription Factor E3 (TFE3) genes (YAP-TFE3). YAP and TAZ are well-defineddownstream effectors in the Hippo pathway that promote cell growth whentranslocated to the nucleus. The TAZ⁻CAMTA1 fusion transcript is insensitive tothe Hippo inhibitory signals that normally prevent this process and thusconstitutively activates the TAZ transcriptome. In EHE, this causes tumors toform in a variety of organs and tissue types, most commonly the liver, lung, and bone. Its clinical course is unpredictable and highly variable. TAZ activation isknown to contribute to key aspects of the cancer phenotype, including metastasis and fibrosis, and increased expression of TAZ is thought to be causally relatedto the progression of many cancers, including breast, lung, and liver. Therefore,understanding TAZ biology and the molecular mechanisms by which it promotesunregulated cell proliferation will yield insights and possibly improvedtreatments for both EHE as well as much more common cancers.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10070229 PMCID: PMC6070876PMID: 29996478
