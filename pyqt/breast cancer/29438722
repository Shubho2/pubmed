Local dysregulation of vitamin D3 metabolism has been identified inpatients with breast cancer, implying that disruption of 1,25(OH)2D signaling maycontribute to breast cancer development in an autocrine or paracrine manner.Mouse mammary glands express the critical enzymes responsible for 1,25(OH)2Dsynthesis (Cyp2r1 and Cyp27b1), degradation (Cyp24a1), as well as the vitamin D3 receptor (Vdr), and genetically modified mouse models have revealed a great deal about the role of vitamin D3 in cancer initiation and progression. Ablation ofVdr or Cyp27b1 in murine models of mammary cancer reduces the anti-tumor effects of vitamin D3, while elevation of Cyp24a1 levels increases degradation of1,25(OH)2D, leading to diminished anti-tumor effects. This review discusses therecent transgenic mouse models of vitamin D3 metabolism and the Vdr signalingnetwork, and how these contribute to mammary gland development, and cancertumorigenesis and progression. Collectively, these mouse models have helpedclarify mechanisms of action of vitamin D3 signaling and suggest that activation or restoration of the vitamin D3 regulated pathway is a potential approach forhuman breast cancer prevention.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
