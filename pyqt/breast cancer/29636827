Topical estrogen is effective but systemic absorption maycounter aromatase inhibitor efficacy. Numerous complementary approaches aremarketed for use in UA without rigorous testing of their estrogenicity. We testedmultiple essential oils in cancer cell growth and estrogen reporter assays invitro and assessed clinical outcomes with the essential oil pessaries (EOPs) inbreast cancer survivors with UA.Methods: Effects on cell growth were tested in hormone-dependent (MCF-7) and-independent (MDA-MB-231) cell lines using the sulforhodamine-B assay. Anestrogen response element (ERE) luciferase reporter assay was used to assessestrogenicity directly. Antifungal activity against two common pathogenic yeasts was assessed using standard microdilution methods. EOPs were offered to breastcancer survivors with symptomatic UA and the service evaluated using serialquestionnaires.Results: Two essential oils, Cymbopogon martinii and Pelargonium graveolens,demonstrated marked estrogenicity, stimulating ER+ cell growth and ERE-luciferasereporter activity to levels seen with premenopausal estradiol concentrations.Additional oils were screened for estrogenicity and Lavandula angustifolia andChamaemelum nobile identified as non/minimally estrogenic. The antifungalactivity of this combination of oils was confirmed. A second cohort of breastcancer survivors with UA received the second generation EOP with comparableimprovement in symptom scores suggesting that estrogenicity may not be requiredfor optimal therapy of UA.Conclusion: Certain essential oils demonstrate profound estrogenicity and cautionshould be exercised before their use in breast cancer survivors. Our minimallyestrogenic pessary will be formally tested in clinical trials.DOI: 10.1177/1758835918766189 PMCID: PMC5888815PMID: 29636827
