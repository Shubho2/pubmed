Electronic address:jamal@iiim.res.in.IGF1R is a ubiquitous receptor tyrosine kinase that plays critical roles in cell proliferation, growth and survival. Clinical studies have demonstratedupregulation of IGF1R mediated signaling in a number of malignancies includingcolon, breast, and lung cancers. Overexpression of the IGF1R in thesemalignancies is associated with a poor prognosis and overall survival. IGF1Rspecific kinase inhibitors have failed in multiple clinical trials partly becauseof the complex nature of IGF1R signaling. Thus identifying new binding partnersand allosteric sites on IGF1R are emerging areas of research. More recently,IGF1R has been shown to translocate into the nucleus and perform many functions. In this study, we generated a library of IGF1R deletion and point mutants toexamine IGF1R subcellular localization and activation of downstream signalingpathways. We show that the nuclear localization of IGF1R is primarily defined by its cytoplasmic domain. We identified a cross-talk between IGF1R andWnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and showed, for the first time, that IGF1R isassociated with upregulation of TCF-mediated β-catenin transcriptional activity. Using loss-of-function mutants, deletion analysis and IGF1R specificinhibitor(s), we show that cytoplasmic and nuclear activities are two independentfunctions of IGF1R. Furthermore, we identified a unique loss-of-function mutationin IGF1R. This unique loss-of-function mutant retains only nuclear functions and sits in a pocket, outside ATP and substrate binding region, that is suited fordesigning allosteric inhibitors of IGF1R.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
