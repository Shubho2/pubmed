No suspiciousenhancement was seen on MRI;Â in particular, no suspicious lesion was seen in the area of clinical concern. In view of persisting focal mastalgia and vagueparenchymal changes in the symptomatic area on repeat targeted ultrasound, a corebiopsy was performed. Final pathology after left mastectomy with axillaryclearance showed a 42 mm grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma. Ten out of 15 lymphnodes contained metastatic carcinoma. This case report presents a large ductalbreast cancer with no enhancement on breast MRI. Factors that may contribute tothe non-detection of breast cancers on MRI studies will be discussed.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2332 PMCID: PMC5953508PMID: 29770285
