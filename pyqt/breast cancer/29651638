A total of 628 patients aged22-91Â years with abnormal screening results or clinical symptoms wereconsecutively enrolled between June 2015 and March 2016. All patients underwentDBT and CDM, and 1164 breasts were retrospectively analyzed by three radiologistswho interpreted the results based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and DataSystem. Categories 4 and 5 were considered positive, and pathological resultswere the gold standard. The diagnostic performance of CDM and CDM plus DBT wascompared using the mean areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)curves.RESULTS: A total of 100 breast cancer cases were identified. The areas under the ROC curves were 0.9160 (95% confidence interval 0.8779-0.9541) for CDM alone and 0.9376 (95% confidence interval 0.9019-0.9733) for CDM plus DBT. The cut-offvalues for both CDM alone and CDM plus DBT measurements were 4, withsensitivities of 61.0% (61/100) and 83.0% (83/100), respectively, andspecificities of 99.1% (1054/1064) and 98.9% (1052/1064), respectively. CDMyielded 39 false-negative diagnoses, while CDM plus DBT identified breast cancer in 22 of those cases (56.4%).CONCLUSION: The combination of DBT and CDM for the diagnosis of breast cancer in women with abnormal examination findings or clinical symptoms proved effectiveand should be used to improve the diagnostic performance of breast cancerexaminations.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0859-3 PMID: 29651638
