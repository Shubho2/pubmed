First Nations- andnon-Aboriginal-specific incidence rates were age-standardized to the worldstandard population. The sex- and site-specific relative risks (RR) of cancer in First Nations compared to those in non-Aboriginal adults were estimated withPoisson regression. Results were stratified by residence on-reserve (all cancers combined) and region of Canada (four most common cancer sites).RESULTS: Compared to non-Aboriginal adults, First Nations had higher incidence ofcolon and rectum, kidney, cervix, and liver cancers and lower incidence ofprostate, breast, bladder, uterus, ovary, and brain cancers, as well asnon-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and melanoma. First Nations women additionallyhad higher incidence of stomach, gallbladder, and laryngeal cancers and lowerincidence of thyroid cancers compared to non-Aboriginal women. The higherrelative incidence of stomach and gallbladder cancers was observed only amongFirst Nations adults who reported living on-reserve. Incidence of lung cancer wassimilar for First Nations and non-Aboriginal adults nationally, though variation by region of Canada was observed.CONCLUSION: First Nations people in Canada have disproportionately high rates of certain cancers, providing evidence to support public health policy andprogramming. More research is needed to identify factors contributing to thesignificantly lower incidence observed for various cancer types. Novel methodsfor studying disparities in cancer incidence among First Nations people arerequired to support ongoing cancer control planning and advocacy.DOI: 10.17269/s41997-018-0091-0 PMID: 29981110
