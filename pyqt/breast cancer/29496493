Electronic address:zuxuyu0108@hotmail.com.Overexpression and activation of Axl receptor tyrosine kinase have been widelyaccepted to promote cell proliferation, chemotherapy resistance, invasion, andmetastasis in several human cancers, such as lung, breast, and pancreaticcancers. Axl, a member of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) family, and its inhibitorscan specifically break the kinase signaling nodes, allowing advanced patients to regain drug sensitivity with improved therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, theresearch on Axl is promising and it is worthy of further investigations. In this review, we present an update on the Axl inhibitors and provide new insights into their latent application.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
