However, the precise mechanism of liprin-α1 function in cancer progressionhas remained elusive.METHODS: Invasion regulating activity of liprin-α1 was examined by analyzing the functions of squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (HNSCC) cell lines inthree-dimensional collagen I after RNAi mediated gene knockdown. Transcriptomeprofiling and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis from HNSCC and breast cancer cellswere used to identify expression changes relevant to specific cellularlocalizations, biological processes and signaling pathways after PPFIA1knockdown. The significance of the results was assessed by relevant statisticalmethods (Wald and Benjamini-Hochberg). Localization of proteins associated toliprin-α1 was studied by immunofluorescence in 2D and 3D conditions. Theassociation of PPFIA1 amplification to HNSCC patient survival was explored using The Cancer Genome Atlas data.RESULTS: In this study, we show that liprin-α1 regulates biological processesrelated to membrane microdomains in breast carcinoma, as well as proteintrafficking, cell-cell and cell-substrate contacts in HNSCC cell lines culturedin three-dimensional matrix. Importantly, we show that in all these cancer cells liprin-α1 knockdown leads to the upregulation of transmembrane protein CD82,which is a suppressor of metastasis in several solid tumors.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide novel information regarding the function ofliprin-α1 in biological processes essential in cancer progression. The resultsreveal liprin-α1 as a novel regulator of CD82, linking liprin-α1 to the cancercell invasion and metastasis pathways.DOI: 10.1186/s12964-018-0253-y PMCID: PMC6045882PMID: 30005669
