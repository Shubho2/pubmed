The phenotype of human circulating Treg cells has been extensivelystudied, but less is known about tumor-infiltrating Treg cells. We studied thephenotype and function of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells in ovarian cancer andmelanoma to identify potential Treg cell-associated molecules that can betargeted by tumor immunotherapies.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The phenotype of intratumoral and circulating Treg cells wasanalyzed by multicolor flow cytometry, mass cytometry, RNA-Seq and functionalassays.RESULTS: Treg cells isolated from ovarian tumors displayed a distinct cellsurface phenotype with increased expression of a number of receptors associatedwith TCR engagement, including PD‑1, 4-1BB and ICOS. Higher PD-1 and 4-1BBexpression was associated with increased responsiveness to further TCRstimulation and increased suppressive capacity, respectively. Transcriptomic and mass cytometry analyses revealed the presence of Treg cell subpopulations andfurther supported a highly activated state specifically in ovarian tumors. Incomparison, Treg cells infiltrating melanomas displayed lower FOXP3, PD-1, 4-1BB and ICOS expression and were less potent suppressors of CD8 T cell proliferation.CONCLUSIONS: The highly activated phenotype of ovarian tumor-infiltrating Tregcells may be a key component of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.Receptors that are expressed by tumor-infiltrating Treg cells could be exploited for the design of novel combination tumor immunotherapies.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0554 PMID: 30065096
