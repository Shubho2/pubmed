We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate that effect on survival.Methods: We performed a systematic search for randomized trials measuring theeffect of adding either neoadjuvant or adjuvant Bevacizumab to the standardchemotherapy on disease-free and overall survival in breast cancer surgicalcandidates. The Mantel-Haenszel method and random effect model were used toanalyze the data. A total of 7 randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis with a mean follow-up of 45 months.Results: No statistically significant difference in overall survival was foundafter adding Bevacizumab to the standard chemotherapy in the overall studypopulation, HR=0.9, 95% CI (90.72-1.13), estrogen/ progesterone positivesubgroup, HR=0.99, 95% CI (0.72-1.35), or in triple negative breast cancer,HR=0.88, 95% CI (0.77-1.01). However, there was a small but significantimprovement in disease-free survival in triple negative breast cancer with a HRof 0.88, 95% CI (0.78-0.98), but not in estrogen/ progesterone receptor positive tumors, HR=1.01, 95% CI (0.81-1.26).Conclusions: The addition of Bevacizumab along with the standard chemotherapywould not improve overall survival in breast cancer surgical candidates, however,due to a small but significant improvement on disease-free survival in triplenegative breast cancer, that would not eliminate the possibility of a certainsubgroup of the latter who might benefit from adding Bevacizumab.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418792250 PMCID: PMC6077892PMID: 30090017
