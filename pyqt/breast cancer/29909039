ECM stiffness is known to enhance integrin clustering and responseto epidermal growth factor (EGF), but we lack information on when or if thesemechanosensitive growth factor receptors and integrins converge intracellularly. Towards closing this knowledge gap, we combined a biomaterial platform withtranscriptomics, molecular biology, and functional assays to linkintegrin-mediated mechanosensing and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)signaling. We found that high integrin α6 expression controlled breast cancercell adhesion and motility on soft, laminin-coated substrates, and this mimicked the response of cells to EGF stimulation. The mechanisms that drove bothmechanosensitive cell adhesion and motility converged on calpain 2, anintracellular protease important for talin cleavage and focal adhesion turnover. EGF stimulation enhanced adhesion and motility on soft substrates, but requiredintegrin α6 and calpain 2 signaling. In sum, we identified a new role forintegrin α6 mechanosensing in breast cancer, wherein cell adhesion to laminin on soft substrates mimicked EGF stimulation. We identified calpain 2, downstream of both integrin α6 engagement and EGFR phosphorylation, as a common intracellularsignaling node, and implicate integrin α6 and calpain 2 as potential targets toinhibit the migration of cancer cells in stiff tumor environments.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
