Such associations may indicate a role forMMTV in human breast cancer.Methods: Immunohistochemical techniques (using antibodies directed against thesignal peptide p14 of the envelope precursor protein of MMTV) and polymerasechain reaction (PCR) analyses were used to identify MMTV proteins and MMTV-likeenvelope gene sequences in a series of breast cancers from Australian women. The histological characteristics of these human breast cancer specimens were comparedwith MMTV positive mouse mammary tumors. The same methods were used to studybenign breast tissues which 1-11 years later developed into breast cancer.Results: MMTV p14 proteins were identified in 27 (54%) of 50 human breastcancers. MMTV env gene sequences were identified by PCR in 12 (27%) of 45 humanbreast cancers. There was a significant correlation between the presence of MMTV (identified by p14 immunohistochemistry) in human breast cancers and histologicalcharacteristics similar to MMTV positive mouse mammary tumors (p = 0.001). There was a non-significant correlation between the presence of MMTV env gene sequences(identified by PCR) in human breast cancers and histological characteristicssimilar to MMTV positive mouse mammary tumors (p = 0.290). MMTV p14 proteins wereidentified in 7 (54%) of 13 benign breast specimens that later developed intohuman breast cancers. MMTV by PCR was identified in two benign specimens one ofwhom later developed MMTV positive breast cancer.Discussion: These observations offer evidence that MMTV may be associated withcharacteristic human breast cancer histology. p14-based immunohistochemistryappears to be a more reliable technique than PCR for the identification of MMTVin human breast cancer. Identification of MMTV-associated p14 proteins in benign breast tissues confirms prior PCR-based studies that MMTV infection occurs beforethe development of MMTV positive breast cancer.Conclusion: Many MMTV positive human breast cancers have similar histology toMMTV positive mouse mammary tumors. MMTV infection identified in benign breasttissues precedes development of MMTV positive human breast cancer. Whenconsidered in the context of prior studies, these observations indicate a likely role for MMTV in human breast cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00141 PMCID: PMC5950654PMID: 29868468
