In this study, weinvestigated a hybrid anisotropic nanostructure, composed of gold (Au) andtitanium dioxide (TiO2), as a radio-sensitizer for radiation therapy oftriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In contrast to other gold-based radiosensitizers, dumbbell-like Au-TiO2 nanoparticles (DATs) show a synergistictherapeutic effect on radiation therapy, mainly because of strong asymmetricelectric coupling between the high atomic number metals and dielectric oxides at their interfaces. The generation of secondary electrons and reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) from DATs triggered by X-ray irradiation can significantly enhance the radiation effect. After endocytosed by cancer cells, DATs can generate alarge amount of ROS under X-ray irradiation, eventually inducing cancer cellapoptosis. Significant tumor growth suppression and overall improvement insurvival rate in a TNBC tumor model have been successfully demonstrated under DATuptake for a radio-sensitized radiation therapy.DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.8b02038 PMID: 29689158
