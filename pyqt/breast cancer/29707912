To this end, the effect of interferons (IFNs) on the MHCpeptidomes of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were evaluated. Although all fourHLA allotypes of the MCF-7 cells (HLA-A*02:01, B*18, B*44, and C*5) presentpeptides of similar lengths and C-termini, which should be processed similarly bythe proteasome and by the APP chaperones, the IFNs induced differentialmodulation of the HLA-A, B, and C peptidomes. In addition, overexpression ofrecombinant soluble HLA-A*02:01, introduced to compete with the identicalendogenous membrane-bound HLA-A*02:01 for peptides of the MCF-7 cells, did notalter the expression level or the presented peptidome of the membrane-boundHLA-A*02:01. Taken together, these results indicate that a surplus supply ofpeptides is available inside the ER for loading onto the MHC-I peptide-receptive molecules, and that cell surface MHC-I expression is likely limited by theavailability of empty MHC molecules.Â© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
