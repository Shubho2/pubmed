In this multi-center, pre-surgical study, we evaluated the tissue effectsof the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in women with stage I-III BC.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two doses of weekly oral MK2206 were administered at days - 9 and - 2 before surgery. The primary endpoint was reduction of pAktSer473 inbreast tumor tissue from diagnostic biopsy to surgery. Secondary endpointsincluded changes in PI3K/AKT pathway tumor markers, tumor proliferation (ki-67), insulin growth factor pathway blood markers, pharmacokinetics (PK), genomics, andMK-2206 tolerability. Paired t tests were used to compare biomarker changes inpre- and post-MK-2206, and two-sample t tests to compare with prospectivelyaccrued untreated controls.RESULTS: Despite dose reductions, the trial was discontinued after 12 patientsdue to grade III rash, mucositis, and pruritus. While there was a trend toreduction in pAKT after MK-2206 (p = 0.06), there was no significant changecompared to controls (n = 5, p = 0.65). After MK-2206, no significant changes in ki-67, pS6, PTEN, or stathmin were observed. There was no significant associationbetween dose level and PK (p = 0.11). Compared to controls, MK-2206 significantlyincreased serum glucose (p = 0.02), insulin (p < 0.01), C-peptide (p < 0.01), anda trend in IGFBP-3 (p = 0.06).CONCLUSION: While a trend to pAKT reduction after MK-2206 was observed, there wasno significant change compared to controls. However, the accrued population waslimited, due to toxicity being greater than expected. Pre-surgical trials canidentify in vivo activity in the early drug development, but side effects must beconsidered in this healthy population.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1888-2 PMID: 29736694
