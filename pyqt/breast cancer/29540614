Potential mechanisms of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy include the up-regulation of alternative angiogenic andproinflammatory factors. Obesity is associated with hypoxic adipose tissues,including those in the breast, resulting in increased production of some of theaforementioned factors. Hence, we hypothesized that obesity could contribute toanti-VEGF therapy's lack of efficacy. We found that BC patients with obesityharbored increased systemic concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and/orfibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and their tumor vasculature was lesssensitive to anti-VEGF treatment. Mouse models revealed that obesity impairs the effects of anti-VEGF on angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. In one murineBC model, obesity was associated with increased IL-6 production from adipocytesand myeloid cells within tumors. IL-6 blockade abrogated the obesity-inducedresistance to anti-VEGF therapy in primary and metastatic sites by directlyaffecting tumor cell proliferation, normalizing tumor vasculature, alleviatinghypoxia, and reducing immunosuppression. Similarly, in a second mouse model,where obesity was associated with increased FGF-2, normalization of FGF-2expression by metformin or specific FGF receptor inhibition decreased vesseldensity and restored tumor sensitivity to anti-VEGF therapy in obese mice.Collectively, our data indicate that obesity fuels BC resistance to anti-VEGFtherapy via the production of inflammatory and angiogenic factors.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science.
