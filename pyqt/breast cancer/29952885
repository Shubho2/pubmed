Shaping of this flap is easiercompared with other flaps because of the quality of the lumbar fat and thegluteal extension.METHODS: Between October of 2010 and June of 2017, a total of 100 lumbar arteryperforator free flap breast reconstructions were performed in 72 patients.Patient demographics, indications, flap specifics, and complications werereviewed retrospectively.RESULTS: Twenty-eight bilateral and 44 unilateral breast reconstructions with alumbar artery perforator flap were performed. Mean patient age was 48 years, and the average body mass index was 23.11 kg/m. The authors report 43 preventivemastectomies for elevated cancer risk with subsequent immediate reconstruction,34 secondary reconstructions, and 14 tertiary reconstructions. Mean operativetime was 7 hours 4 minutes, including the mastectomy in primary cases. Mean flap weight was 499 g (range, 77 to 1216 g) and mean follow-up time was 30 months. Therevision rate was 22 percent and nine flaps were lost.CONCLUSIONS: The lumbar artery perforator flap is a valuable alternative to theDIEAP flap in breast reconstructive surgery. It is an excellent flap forBRCA-positive patients who are typically young and have limited excess tissue at the conventional donor sites. Despite higher revision rates compared with theDIEAP flap, the lumbar flap is superior in mimicking the shape and feel of nativebreast tissue. Scarring at the donor site remains a sore point but can be easily treated and used to an advantage to contour the flanks.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004522 PMID: 29952885
