We recorded the patient risk factors forbreast cancer. In 85 patients with suspicious lesions, biopsy results wereavailable.RESULTS: We analyzed 465 contrast mammographies. The most common clinicalindications were suspicion of cancer and previous inconclusive studies. Mass typelesions were detected in 33% of the studies. Non-mass-type lesions were observed in 10% of cases and findings compatible with papillomatosis in 2%. Fifty fivepercent of the studies had no visible lesions. In the 85 patients with apathological study of the biopsy, the sensitivity of the contrast mammography was100%, with a diagnostic accuracy of 85%, positive and negative predictive values of 82 and 100% respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Contrast mammography can be of great use for the assessment ofpatients with an altered conventional mammography, before indicating a magneticresonance imaging or a percutaneous biopsy.DOI: 10.4067/s0034-98872018000200141 PMID: 29999149  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
