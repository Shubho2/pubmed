Epub2018 May 7.An Assessment of the In Vitro Inhibition of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes,UDP-Glucuronosyltransferases, and Transporters by Phosphodiester- orPhosphorothioate-Linked Oligonucleotides.Kazmi F(1), Yerino P(2), McCoy C(2), Parkinson A(2), Buckley DB(2), OgilvieBW(2).Author information: (1)Sekisui XenoTech LLC, Kansas City, Kansas (F.K., P.Y., C.M., D.B.B., B.W.O.); Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, Pennsylvania (F.K.); XPDConsulting, Shawnee, Kansas (A.P.); and Roivant Sciences, Durham, North Carolina (D.B.B.) fkazmi@its.jnj.com.(2)Sekisui XenoTech LLC, Kansas City, Kansas (F.K., P.Y., C.M., D.B.B., B.W.O.); Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring House, Pennsylvania (F.K.); XPDConsulting, Shawnee, Kansas (A.P.); and Roivant Sciences, Durham, North Carolina (D.B.B.).Oligonucleotides represent an expanding class of pharmacotherapeutics indevelopment for various indications. Typically, oligonucleotides are developedwith phosphorothioate linkages for the improvement of biologic stability;however, limited data are available on the potential of these molecules to cause drug-drug interactions (DDIs). In this study, four nontherapeuticoligonucleotides with either a phosphodiester or phosphorothioate linkage andpartial sequences towards glutathione peroxidase or β-actin (PD-GP and PD-Ac orPT-GP and PT-Ac, respectively) were evaluated in vitro for their potential toinhibit cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes and UGP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) inboth human liver microsomes (HLMs) and cryopreserved human hepatocytes (CHHs) andto inhibit select transporters in expression systems. PD-GP and PD-Ac had little to no inhibitory effect on any P450 or UGT enzymes in HLMs and CHHs, except forPD-Ac in HLMs for CYP2C19 (IC50 = 29 μM). Conversely, PT-GP and PT-Ac causeddirect inhibition of almost all P450 and UGT enzymes, with CYP1A2 (IC50 values of0.8-4.2 μM), CYP2C8 (IC50 values of 1.1-12 μM), and UGT1A1 (IC50 values of4.5-5.4 μM) inhibited to the greatest extent. There was evidence of possibletime-dependent inhibition (TDI) of P450 enzymes with PT-GP and PT-Ac for CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5; however, this TDI was reversible. In contrast to HLMs, there was little to no direct P450 inhibition by anyoligonucleotide in CHHs [except for PD-Ac with CYP2C19 (IC50 = 36 μM) and TDI by PT-GP with CYP2C8], demonstrating test system-dependent outcomes. Inhibition was observed for the organic anion uptake transporters, including organicanion-transporting polypeptide OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, organic anion transportersOAT1 and OAT3, and organic cation transporter OCT2 (IC50 values of 12-29 μM), butnot OCT1 or the efflux transporters breast cancer resistance protein andP-glycoprotein by the phosphorothioate oligonucleotides.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/dmd.118.081729 PMID: 29735754
