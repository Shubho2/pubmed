Epub2018 Apr 2.Manipulating multifaceted microbubble shell composition to target bothTRAIL-sensitive and resistant cells.Jablonowski LJ(1), Conover D(1), Teraphongphom NT(1), Wheatley MA(1).Author information: (1)School of Biomedical Engineering, Science, and Health Systems, DrexelUniversity, 3141 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104.This study represents the first attempt to combine surface TRAIL expression anddoxorubicin co-encapsulation in a single drug delivery agent in the form ofultrasound-responsive microbubbles that shatter into fragments, or nanoshards, inan ultrasound beam. We compare customized microbubbles of different polymericshell compositions, and investigate the effect of both shell composition andincorporation of doxorubicin on action against TRAIL-sensitive MDA-MB-231 andTRAIL-resistant MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells. Ligation of TRAIL onlysignificantly impacted MDA-MB-231 cells predominantly by apoptosis, and hadminimal effect on MCF12A (normal control) cells. For all shell types, nanoshards had a greater effect (apoptotic death ranging from approximately 25% for 1 wt %LipidPEG to 50% for 100% PLA), reflecting the greater surface area and largernumber of particles that ultrasound generates. Encapsulation of doxorubicingenerated necrosis in all cell lines, but PEGylation produced less effectivenecrosis in all cell lines. Co-encapsulation of doxorubicin within the contrastagent shell increased MDA-MB-231 cell death to approximately 40-80%, representinga marked increase over TRAIL alone, reflecting the dramatic effect of shellcomposition. Additionally, shells that co-encapsulated TRAIL and doxorubicinresulted in approximately 30-60% death in TRAIL-resistant MCF7 human breastadenocarcinoma cells, compared with little apoptotic response in these cells fromshells encapsulating TRAIL alone, demonstrating the sensitization effect of thedrug. This work has resulted in production of a library of effectiveultrasound-triggered, minimally immunogenic, targeted drug delivery agents forpotential use in cancer therapy, and represents a promising multifacetedtreatment to better serve the population with solid tumors. © 2018 WileyPeriodicals, Inc.
