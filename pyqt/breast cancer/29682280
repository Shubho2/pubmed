A series of N2,N4-diphenylpyrimidine-2,4-diamines werepreviously identified as potent CDK2/CDK9 inhibitors. To explore the SAR of this structural prototype, twenty-four novel N2,N4-disubstitutedpyrimidine-2,4-diamines were designed and synthesized. Among them, twenty-onecompounds exhibited potent inhibitory activities against both CDK2/cyclin A andCDK9/cyclin T1 systems, and the most potent CDK2 and CDK9 inhibitors, 3g and 3c, showed IC50 values of 83 nM and 65 nM respectively. Most of these compoundsdisplayed significant inhibition against the tested tumor cell lines in the SRBassay, and in particular, remained active against the triple-negative breastcancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231. Flow cytometer analysis of compounds 2a, 2dand 3b in MDA-MB-231 cells indicated that these compounds induced cell cyclearrest in G2/M phase. Docking studies on compound 3g were performed, whichprovided conducive clues for further molecular optimization.DOI: 10.1039/c8ra01440j PMCID: PMC5890689PMID: 29682280
