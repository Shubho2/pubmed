In patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), thesemutations increase after multiline treatment, thereby decreasing treatmentefficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate gene mutation patterns in MBCpatients to predict drug resistance and disease progression.METHOD: A total of 68 MBC patients who had received multiline treatment wererecruited. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutations were evaluated and comparedamong hormone receptor (HR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)subgroups.RESULTS: The baseline gene mutation pattern (at the time of recruitment) variedamong HR/HER2 subtypes. BRCA1 and MED12 were frequently mutated in triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, PIK3CA and FAT1 mutations were frequentin HR+ patients, and PIK3CA and ERBB2 mutations were frequent in HER2+ patients. Gene mutation patterns also varied in patients who progressed within either3 months or 3-6 months of chemotherapy treatment. For example, in HR+ patientswho progressed within 3 months of treatment, the frequency of TERT mutationssignificantly increased. Other related mutations included FAT1 and NOTCH4. In HR+patients who progressed within 3-6 months, PIK3CA, TP53, MLL3, ERBB2, NOTCH2, andERS1 were the candidate mutations. This suggests that different mechanismsunderlie disease progression at different times after treatment initiation. Inthe COX model, the ctDNA TP53 + PIK3CA gene mutation pattern successfullypredicted progression within 6 months.CONCLUSION: ctDNA gene mutation profiles differed among HR/HER2 subtypes of MBCpatients. By identifying mutations associated with treatment resistance, we hope to improve therapy selection for MBC patients who received multiline treatment.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
