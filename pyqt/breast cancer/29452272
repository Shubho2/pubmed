Herein, doxorubicin(DOX)-conjugated smart polymeric micelles based on 4-carboxy benzaldehyde-graftedpoly (L-lysine)-block-poly (methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine)(PLL(CB/DOX)-b-PMPC) copolymer are prepared. DOX and electronegative 4-carboxybenzaldehyde are conjugated to the PLL block via an imine linkage and as aresult, the drug loaded micelles exhibited the pH-triggered charge-conversionproperty and accelerated drug release at tumor pH. In vitro cytotoxicity studies of these DOX-loaded micelles exhibited great tumor inhibition against HeLa and4T1 cells. Moreover, in mice models of breast cancer, these DOX-loaded micellesshowed better anti-tumor efficacy and less organ toxicity than free drug. Insummary, these polymeric micelles could be applied as potential nanocarriers for cancer therapy.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: As a typical anti-cancer drug,Doxorubicin (DOX) exhibited remarkable tumor inhibition but was limited by itslow drug utilization and strong toxicity to organs. To overcome these challenges,we developed a DOX-conjugated polymeric micelle as a nano drug carrier which was endowed with pH-sensitivity and charge-conversion function. The structure ofmicelles would quickly disintegrate with surface charge-conversion in acidicenvironment, which would contribute to the endosomal escape and accelerated drug release. These DOX-conjugated micelles would provide a promising platform for theefficient DOX delivery and better anti-cancer efficiency.Copyright Â© 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
