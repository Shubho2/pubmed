However, recurrence andchemotherapeutic drug resistance limit the survival rates of patients with CRC.DNA methylation participates in diverse cellular processes by regulating thetranscription of a large number of genes expression, cell division, apoptosis,cell adhesion and differentiation, and metabolism, thus it might mediatechemoresistance. Using an Illumina Infinium HD Assay, DNA methylation levels in ahuman 5-FU-resistant HCT-8 CRC cell line (HCT-8/FU) and its progenitor cell line HCT-8 were analysed. A total of 16,580 differentially methylated genes wereidentified, of which 8885 were hypermethylated and 7695 were hypomethylated inresistant cells. Among these genes, NME2 (nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2)exhibited a significant difference in methylation between cell lines and hasknown roles in gastric cancer and breast cancer; accordingly, we hypothesizedthat it plays a role in acquired resistance in CRC. Knockdown of NME2 restored5-FU sensitivity in 5-FU-resistant CRC cells, reduced cell survival and increasedcell apoptosis; and overexpression of NME2 in HCT-8 cells results in theacquisition of resistance to 5-FU, this alteration enhanced HCT-8 cells growthabilities and reduced apoptosis. These findings suggest that NME2 mediateschemoresistance to 5-FU in CRC and that specific NME2 inhibition could optimize5-FU-based chemotherapy of CRC.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1439835 PMID: 29475390
