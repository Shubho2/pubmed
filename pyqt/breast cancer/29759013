[Epub ahead of print]Adapting to a Shifting Health Care Landscape: Illinois Breast and Cervical CancerProgram Lead Agencies' Perspectives.Molina Y(1), San Miguel C(1), Sanz S(2), San Miguel L(1), Rankin K(1), HandlerA(1).Author information: (1)1 University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.(2)2 California Department of Public Health, San Diego, CA, USA.Understanding how safety net programs adapt to systemic health care changes ispivotal for creating feasible recommendations for policy implementation. Thisstudy characterizes perspectives of Lead Agency (LA) coordinators of the IllinoisBreast and Cervical Cancer Program (IBCCP) in response to sociopolitical changes at state and national levels. Our cross-sectional study included 29semistructured telephone interviews between December 2015 and January 2016.Respondents indicated some changes in the priority population served, changes in referrals and clinical services, and, a continued commitment to IBCCP. Ourfindings suggest that IBCCP and other safety net programs will need to beflexible to meet the ongoing needs of historically vulnerable populations in acomplex, shifting environment. Implications for public health practice and policyinclude the need to ensure that program personnel are aware of evidence-basedstrategies to reach different priority populations and are kept abreast oforganizational and system changes that may affect referral patterns as well asthe need to educate health care providers working with safety net programs about changes in the delivery and coordination of services.DOI: 10.1177/1524839918776012 PMID: 29759013
