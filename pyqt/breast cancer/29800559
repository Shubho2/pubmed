[Epub ahead of print]Measuring estrogens in women, men, and children: Recent advances 2012-2017.Smy L(1), Straseski JA(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, USA.(2)Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, UT 84108, USA. Electronic address: joely.a.straseski@aruplab.com.The measurement of estrogens is important for diagnosing and monitoring thehealth of women, men, and children. For example, for postmenopausal women orwomen undergoing treatment for breast cancer with aromatase inhibitors, themeasurement of extremely low concentrations of estrogens in serum, especiallyestradiol, is problematic but essential for proper medical care. Achieving superbanalytical sensitivity and specificity has been and continues to be a challengefor the clinical laboratory, but is a challenge that is being taken seriously.Focusing on publications from 2012 to 2017, this review will provide an overview of recent research in the development of methods to accurately and preciselymeasure estrogens, including a variety of estrogen metabolites. Additionally, thelatest in clinical research involving estrogen measurement in women, men, andchildren will be presented to provide an update on the association of estrogenswith diseases or conditions such as breast cancer, precocious puberty,infertility, and pregnancy. This research update will provide context as to whyestrogen measurement is important and why laboratories are working hard tosupport the recommendations made by the Endocrine Society regarding estrogenmeasurement.Copyright Â© 2018 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.
