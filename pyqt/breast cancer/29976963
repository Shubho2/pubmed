Clement.thomas@lih.lu.Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumours that promotes invasion andmetastatic dissemination. Invadopodia are actin-rich membrane protrusions thatdirect extracellular matrix proteolysis and facilitate tumour cell invasion.Here, we show that CSRP2, an invadopodial actin bundling protein, is upregulated by hypoxia in various breast cancer cell lines, as well as in pre-clinical andclinical breast tumour specimens. We functionally characterized two hypoxiaresponsive elements within the proximal promoter of CSRP2 gene which are targetedby hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and required for promoter transactivationin response to hypoxia. Remarkably, CSRP2 knockdown significantly inhibitshypoxia-stimulated invadopodium formation, ECM degradation and invasion inMDA-MB-231 cells, while CSRP2 forced expression was sufficient to enhance theinvasive capacity of HIF-1α-depleted cells under hypoxia. In MCF-7 cells, CSRP2upregulation was required for hypoxia-induced formation of invadopodiumprecursors that were unable to promote ECM degradation. Collectively, our datasupport that CSRP2 is a novel and direct cytoskeletal target of HIF-1 whichfacilitates hypoxia-induced breast cancer cell invasion by promoting invadopodia formation.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-28637-x PMCID: PMC6033879PMID: 29976963
