We sought to identify factors associated with improvedMBC outcomes and increased likelihood of MBC diagnosis.METHODS: Women ≥ 18 years of age with stage I-III MBC and non-MBC diagnosedbetween 2010 and 2014 were identified in the National Cancer Data Base.Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used toestimate associations with overall survival (OS). Multivariate logisticregression identified factors associated with MBC diagnosis.RESULTS: Overall, 2451 MBC and 568,057 non-MBC patients were included; 70.3% ofMBC vs. 11.3% of non-MBC patients were triple negative (p < 0.001). Five-year OS was reduced among MBC vs. non-MBC patients for the entire cohort (72.7 vs. 87.5%)and among triple-negative patients (71.1 vs. 77.8%; both p < 0.001). In MBC,triple-negative (vs. luminal) subtype was not associated with worse OS (hazardratio [HR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-1.54, p = 0.28). Compared withnon-MBC patients, MBC patients were more likely to receive mastectomy (59.0 vs.44.9%), chemotherapy (74.1 vs. 43.1%), and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND; 35.2 vs. 32.2%, all p ≤ 0.001). MBC patients more frequently had negative ALND(pN0) than non-MBC patients (20.0 vs. 10.6%, p < 0.001). Among MBC patients,chemotherapy (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.89, p = 0.004) and radiotherapy (HR 0.52,95% CI 0.39-0.69, p < 0.001) were associated with improved survival, while ALNDwas associated with decreased survival (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.06-1.77, p = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: MBC patients had worse survival than non-MBC patients, independentof receptor status, suggesting that MBC may confer an additional survivaldisadvantage. Multimodal therapy was associated with improved outcomes, but ALND was not and may be overutilized in MBC.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6533-3 PMCID: PMC6039971 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29855830
