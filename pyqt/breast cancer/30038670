A strong rationale for inhibiting CDK4/6 inbreast cancers has been present for many years. However, potent and selectiveCDK4/6 inhibitors have only recently become available. These agents preventphosphorylation of the RB tumor suppressor, thereby invoking cancer cell cyclearrest in G1. CDK4/6 inhibitors have transited rapidly from preclinical studiesto the clinical arena, and three have already been approved for the treatment of advanced, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients on account ofstriking clinical trial results demonstrating substantial improvements inprogression-free survival. ER-positive breast cancers harbor several molecularfeatures that would predict their sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. As physiciansgain experience with using these agents in the clinic, new questions arise: areCDK4/6 inhibitors likely to be useful for patients with other subtypes of breast cancer? Are there other agents that could be effectively combined with CDK4/6inhibitors, beyond endocrine therapy? Is there a rationale for combining CDK4/6inhibitors with novel immune-based therapies? In this review, we describe notonly the clinical data available to date, but also the biology of the CDK4/6pathway and discuss answers to these questions. In particular, we highlight that CDK4 and CDK6 govern much more than the cancer cell cycle, and that their optimaluse in the clinic depends on a deeper understanding of the less wellcharacterized effects of these enzymes.DOI: 10.1177/1758835918786451 PMCID: PMC6050811PMID: 30038670
