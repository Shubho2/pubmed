The primary efficacy endpoint was durationof severe neutropenia (DSN) during the first cycle of treatment. Patients whowere candidates for adjuvant/neoadjuvant TC chemotherapy were eligible forparticipation. TC was administered on Day 1, followed by 45, 135, or 270 μg/kgRolontis or 6 mg pegfilgrastim on Day 2. Complete blood counts were monitoreddaily when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) fell to <1.5 × 109 /L. Up to four cycles of TC were investigated. The difference in DSN (time from ANC <0.5 × 109/L to ANC recovery ≥2.0 × 109 /L) between the Rolontis and pegfilgrastim groupswas -0.28 days (confidence interval [CI]: -0.56, -0.06) at 270 μg/kg, 0.14 days(CI: -0.28, 0.64) at 135 μg/kg, and 0.72 days (CI: 0.19, 1.27) at 45 μg/kg.Noninferiority to pegfilgrastim was demonstrated at 135 μg/kg (P = 0.002) and270 μg/kg (P < .001), with superiority demonstrated at 270 μg/kg (0.03 days;P = 0.023). The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were bonepain, myalgia, arthralgia, back pain, and elevated white blood cell counts, with similar incidences across groups. All doses of Rolontis were well tolerated, and no new or significant treatment-related toxicities were observed. In Cycle 1,Rolontis demonstrated noninferiority at the 135 μg/kg dose and statisticalsuperiority in DSN at the 270 μg/kg dose when compared to pegfilgrastim.© 2018 The Authors.
