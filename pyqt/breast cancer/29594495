Weinvestigated to what extent isolated tumor cells (ITC) or micrometastasis inSLNBs is associated with proven tumor cells or metastasis in non-sentinel lymphnodes. Furthermore, we investigated the feasibility of SLNB in multifocal andmulticentric tumors as both entities have been considered a contraindication for this technique.METHODS: 1214 women suffering from T1 and T2 invasive breast cancer, withclinically and sonographically insuspect axillary status and undergoing primarybreast cancer surgery including SLNB and axillary staging in case of SLN(sentinel lymph node) metastases, were recruited into this multicentered study.RESULTS: ITC and micrometastases were found in 2.01 and 21.4% of patients withSLN metastases (n = 299). Among patients with sentinel micrometastases, 4.7%showed further axillary micrometastases, while only two patients (3.1%) had twoaxillary macrometastases. Multifocal and multicentric tumors were diagnosed in9.3 and 2.6% of our patients who at least had one SLN resected, respectively.Detection rates of SLNs did not differ between the cohorts suffering fromunicentric and multifocal or multicentric disease. Moreover, the portion oftumor-free SLNs, the number of SLNs with metastasis as well as the mean number ofresected SLNs did not differ.CONCLUSIONS: No patient with sentinel node micrometastases showed more than twoaxillary macrometastases. Multifocal and multicentric disease is nocontraindication for SLNB.DOI: 10.1007/s00404-018-4760-2 PMID: 29594495
