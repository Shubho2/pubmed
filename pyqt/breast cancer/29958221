[Epub ahead ofprint]Potent Inactivation-Dependent Inhibition of Adult and Neonatal NaV1.5 Channels byLidocaine and Levobupivacaine.Elajnaf T(1), Baptista-Hon DT, Hales TG.Author information: (1)From The Institute of Academic Anaesthesia, Division of Neuroscience, Schoolof Medicine, Ninewells Hospital, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom.BACKGROUND: Cardiotoxic effects of local anesthetics (LAs) involve inhibition of NaV1.5 voltage-gated Na channels. Metastatic breast and colon cancer cells alsoexpress NaV1.5, predominantly the neonatal splice variant (nNaV1.5) and theirinhibition by LAs reduces invasion and migration. It may be advantageous totarget cancer cells while sparing cardiac function through selective blockade of nNaV1.5 and/or by preferentially affecting inactivated NaV1.5, which predominate in cancer cells. We tested the hypotheses that lidocaine and levobupivacainedifferentially affect (1) adult (aNaV1.5) and nNaV1.5 and (2) the resting andinactivated states of NaV1.5.METHODS: The whole-cell voltage-clamp technique was used to evaluate the actions of lidocaine and levobupivacaine on recombinant NaV1.5 channels expressed inHEK-293 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding eitheraNaV1.5 or nNaV1.5. Voltage protocols were applied to determine depolarizingpotentials that either activated or inactivated 50% of maximum conductance (V½activation and V½ inactivation, respectively).RESULTS: Lidocaine and levobupivacaine potently inhibited aNaV1.5 (IC50 mean[SD]: 20 [22] and 1 [0.6] µM, respectively) and nNaV1.5 (IC50 mean [SD]: 17 [10] and 3 [1.6] µM, respectively) at a holding potential of -80 mV. IC50s differedsignificantly between lidocaine and levobupivacaine with no influence of splicevariant. Levobupivacaine induced a statistically significant depolarizing shiftin the V½ activation for aNaV1.5 (mean [SD] from -32 [4.6] mV to -26 [8.1] mV)but had no effect on the voltage dependence of activation of nNaV1.5. Lidocainehad no effect on V½ activation of either variant but caused a significantlygreater depression of maximum current mediated by nNaV1.5 compared to aNaV1.5.Similar statistically significant shifts in the V½ inactivation (approximately-10 mV) occurred for both LAs and NaV1.5 variants. Levobupivacaine (1 µM) caused a significantly greater slowing of recovery from inactivation of both variantsthan did lidocaine (10 µM). Both LAs caused approximately 50% tonic inhibition ofaNaV1.5 or nNaV1.5 when holding at -80 mV. Neither LA caused tonic block at aholding potential of either -90 or -120 mV, voltages at which there was littlesteady-state inactivation. Higher concentrations of either lidocaine (300 µM) or levobupivacaine (100 µM) caused significantly more tonic block at -120 mV.CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that low concentrations of the LAs exhibitinactivation-dependent block of NaV1.5, which may provide a rationale for theiruse to safely inhibit migration and invasion by metastatic cancer cells withoutcardiotoxicity.DOI: 10.1213/ANE.0000000000003597 PMID: 29958221
