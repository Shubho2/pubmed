We just explorethe molecular mechanism between them in vitro and vivo. CCK-8 assay and flowcytometer were used to detect the cytotoxicity and mode of cell death afterMPPa-PDT. Furthermore, the role of autophagy was verified in MPPa-PDT. Confocalmicroscopy was used to show the intracellular distribution of MPPa. ER stressmarkers and PERK signaling pathway were detected by western blot. While in vivo, tumor histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to show the effect ofMPPa-PDT in mice. After MPPa-PDT, cells viability decreased in dose-dependentmanner. Besides, the cell apoptosis increased along with the increasing ofBeclin-1and LC3B II but declining of P62. When pretreated with 3-MA, LC3B IIformation and the cytotoxicity declined. MPPa-PDT caused increasing of ER stress markers (GRP78, CHOP) as MPPa accumulated in ER. However, pretreatment with ERstress inhibitor 4PBA, the expression of GRP78 and LC3B II was blocked but thePERK signaling pathway activated and the expression of P62 increased. In vivo,the tumor growth was significantly inhibited by MPPa-PDT. Besides, the appearanceof ER stress and autophagy was further demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Our findings demonstrate that autophagy mediated by MPPa-PDT was regulated by ERstress, via PERK signaling pathway, to kill MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and vivo.Â© 2018 The Authors.
