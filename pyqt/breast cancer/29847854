One of the most common sideeffects of AIs is joint pain; it is also the most frequently cited reason fornonadherence and discontinuation before completion of the prescribed treatmentcourse. Nonadherence and, in particular, discontinuation, can lead to increasedrates of breast cancer mortality. The prevalence of AI-induced arthralgias isabout 50%, and there are several interventions, including switching to adifferent AI, that can increase adherence. The healthcare professional plays apart in fostering adherence by communicating the side effects of AIs to patients before the initiation of treatment, as well as explaining the strategies foraddressing these side effects, should they occur.PMID: 29847854  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
