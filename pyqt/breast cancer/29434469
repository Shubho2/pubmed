This narrative review isintended to provide an overview between inflammation and breast cancer, inaddition to the effects exercise may have on common inflammatory markers thathave been examined in both healthy populations and breast cancer survivorsthroughout the literature. The inconsistencies and gaps in the literatureaddressed may be important for future research to further understand therelationship between exercise and inflammation, as well as the underlyingbiological mechanisms that are responsible for these changes. For the purpose of organization, this review is structured into the following sections: (1) BreastCancer Facts, Treatment-Related Side Effects, and General Exercise Benefits; (2) Effects of Exercise on Markers of Inflammation in Cancer-Free Populations; (3)Cancer and Markers of Inflammation; (4) Effects of Exercise on Markers ofInflammation in Breast Cancer Survivors; and (5) Conclusions.DOI: 10.1177/1178223417743976 PMCID: PMC5802700PMID: 29434469
