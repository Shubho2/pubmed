Patients visiting a cancerclinic encountered opportunities to learn more about cancer care. They wereoffered health materials that were described as reporting on "palliative,""supportive," or "hospice" care and the primary outcome was whether a patientdecided to select or reject each. As a secondary outcome, the study measured the patient's level of interest in receiving each.RESULTS: Compared with alternatives, materials labeled as "supportive" care were most likely to be selected and considered valuable (p value <0.01).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the terminology used had a large effect and, comparedwith alternatives, the information labeled as being about "supportive" care wassignificantly more likely to be selected. If these effects are supported byadditional research, there may be low-cost, highly feasible changes in languagechoice that increase the dissemination of relevant health information.DOI: 10.1089/jpm.2017.0650 PMID: 29676957
