It is aggressive and most common in African women.In this study we identified the frequency, clinical an pathologicalcharacteristics of this type in a cohort of women in Eastern Algeria.Methods: We conducted a retrospective study between January 2010 and December2015 at the regional hospital of Constantine in eastern Algeria. Among 472 women with breast cancer, 102 women had a TNBC. Clinical and pathological features and overall survival were analyzed.Results: 21.61% of patients had TNBC with a median age of 52 years. 65.31% of thepatients were menopausal. Only 6.82% of women had a family history of breastcancer. The majority of patients had infiltrating ductal carcinoma (96.08%), the proportion of grade III SBR was 53.92%. The average tumor size was 4.4cm and70.1% of the tumors had a very large size (T2 and T3). 69.07% of patients hadpositive lymph nodes, vascular invasion was found in 48.57% of cases. Metastatic sites were bone in 16.13% of cases, hepatic in 3.26% and pulmonary in 0.98%. For treatment modalities, 95.24% underwent surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. 33.33% of patients have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 29% of completepathologic response (pCR) and 96.97% have received radiotherapy. Overall Survival(OS) for all patients at 5 years was 45.2%.Conclusion: Most of our results are in accordance with literature data, howeverwe noted some discrepancies. In this study, TNBC is more common in menopausalwomen than non menopausal women and characterized by a low rate of visceralmetastases and a lower overall survival at 5 years.DOI: 10.11604/pamj.2018.29.45.12523 PMCID: PMC5987100PMID: 29875927  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
