Denosumab, an antibody raised against the receptoractivator of nuclear factor-κB ligand, has been proven to protect againstAI-induced bone loss. Hence, we aimed to determine whether denosumab is effectivein postmenopausal Japanese women with osteoporosis, treated with AI. Weprospectively evaluated the bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine andthe bilateral femoral neck in 102 postmenopausal women with clinical hormonereceptor-positive breast cancer, stages I-IIIA, during a postoperative period of 12 months. The other inclusion criteria for this study were: women that shouldreceive AIs as adjuvant therapy and those with evidence of osteoporosis (lumbarspine or bilateral femoral neck BMD, equivalent to T-score classificationof ≤ - 2.5) upon enrollment. The patients received supplemental calcium, vitamin D, and 60 mg of subcutaneous denosumab every 6 months. The BMD of the lumberspine increased by 4.9 and 6.6% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. An increase in BMD was observed at the femoral neck, bilaterally. Hypocalcemia ≥ grade 2,osteonecrosis of the jaw, and non-traumatic clinical fracture were not observedin this study. Our findings revealed that biannual treatment with denosumab isassociated with a great increase of BMD in Japanese women receiving adjuvant AItherapy, irrespective of their previous history of AI therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00774-018-0917-0 PMID: 29520506
