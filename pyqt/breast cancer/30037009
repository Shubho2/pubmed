Therefore, we aimed toanalyze the inflammatory response in 4T1-bearing mice treated with thesecompounds. Gene expression analysis of the splenocytes and regional lymph nodesdemonstrated prevalence of the T helper lymphocytes (Th2) response with anincreased activity of regulatory T (Treg) lymphocytes in mice treated with these compounds. We also observed an increased number of mature granulocytes and Blymphocytes and a decreased number of TCD4⁺, TCD4⁺CD25⁺, and TCD8⁺, as well asnatural killer (NK) CD335⁺, cells in the blood of mice treated with calcitrioland its analogs. Among the splenocytes, we observed a significant decrease in NK CD335⁺ cells and an increase in TCD8⁺ cells. Calcitriol and its analogs decreasedthe levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-10 and increased the level of interferongamma (IFN-γ) in the plasma. In the tumor tissue, they caused an increase in the level of IL-10. Gene expression analysis of lung tissue demonstrated an increasedlevel of osteopontin (Spp1) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) mRNA. Theexpression of Spp1 was also elevated in lymph nodes. Calcitriol and its analogscaused prevalence of tumor-conducive changes in the immune system of 4T1tumor-bearing mice, despite the induction of some tumor-disadvantageous effects.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19072116 PMID: 30037009
