China.Keloid scarring is a type of fibroproliferative disease with a high recurrencerate. However, no effective treatment is currently available. Combined therapywith recombinant lentivirus‑mediated Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase (Dm‑dNK) and prodrug has been widely studied and used for cancertreatment. Due to the similarities between keloid scars and tumors, the aim ofthe present study was to investigate the efficacy of a Dm‑dNK/nucleoside analogsystem for the treatment of keloid scars. Recombinant lentivirus expression ofthe Dm‑dNK suicide gene was assessed. Western blotting was used to examine theprotein expression of lentivirus mediated Dm‑dNK in keloid fibroblasts. Enzymeactivity assays were conducted using [3H]‑labeled substrates. Furthermore,cytotoxicity and bystander effects were evaluated using MTT assays. Theexpression of green fluorescent protein was observed using fluorescencemicroscope and results indicated that there was no notable difference inlentivirus infectivity between the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and 10 incells. Notably, western blotting revealed that Dm‑dNK was stably expressed inkeloid fibroblasts and the enzymatic activity assays revealed that the enzyme wasactivated following introduction into the keloid fibroblasts via the lentivirus. The cytotoxicity and bystander effects of Dm‑dNK combined with cytotoxicnucleoside analogs were both observed in Dm‑dNK+ keloid fibroblasts. Theseresults demonstrated that the lentivirus‑mediated Dm‑dNK therapy may be effectivein treating keloid fibroblasts, which provides some evidence for the use ofDm‑dNK/prodrug therapy for keloid treatment in vivo in the future.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9101 PMID: 29901093
