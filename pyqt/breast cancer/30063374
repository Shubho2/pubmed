Histogram analysis was performed to measure the voxel-basedenhancement of the entire lesion to obtain 90th, 75th, and 50th percentile valuesat each time point and to generate kinetic curves. Two observers selectedvisually identified peak enhancement within the lesions to generate the kineticcurves. The kinetic curves from histogram and visually identified peakenhancement analyses were fitted by means of an empiric mathematic model (EMM):ΔS(t) = A × (1 - e-αt), where A is the upper limit of signal intensity, eindicates the exponential function, and α (min-1) is the rate of increase insignal intensity. The initial slope of the kinetic curve (A × α) and the initial AUC (AUC30) were calculated. These parameters were compared between benign andmalignant lesions, and results from visually identified peak enhancement analysiswere compared with those from histogram analysis.RESULTS: Benign lesions were successfully differentiated from malignant lesionsin both visually identified peak enhancement and histogram analyses (90th and75th percentile values) on the basis of α, A × α, and AUC30 from the EMM. Therewas no significant difference in ROC AUC in these EMM parameters between visuallyidentified peak enhancement and histogram analyses (p = 0.21).CONCLUSION: Kinetic assessment with visually identified peak enhancement wasacceptable for differentiating benign from malignant lesions.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.19225 PMID: 30063374
