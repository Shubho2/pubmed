[Epub ahead ofprint]Clinical implications of low skeletal muscle mass in early-stage breast andcolorectal cancer.Cespedes Feliciano E(1), Chen WY(2).Author information: (1)Division of Research,Kaiser Permanente,Oakland, CA,USA.(2)Department of Medical Oncology,Dana Farber Cancer Institute,Boston, MA,USA.Although obesity has now been widely accepted to be an important risk factor for cancer survival, the associations between BMI and cancer mortality have not been consistently linear. Although morbid obesity has clearly been associated withworse survival, some studies have suggested a U-shaped association with noadverse association with overweight or lower levels of obesity. This 'obesityparadox' may be due to the fact that BMI likely incompletely captures keymeasures of body composition, including distribution of skeletal muscle andadipose tissue. Fat and lean body mass can be measured using clinically acquired computed tomography scans. Many of the earlier studies focused on patients withmetastatic cancer. However, skeletal muscle loss in the metastatic setting mayreflect end-stage disease processes. Therefore, this article focuses on theclinical implication of low skeletal muscle mass in early-stage non-metastaticbreast and colorectal cancer where measures of body composition have been shownto be strong predictors of disease-free survival and overall survival and alsochemotherapy toxicity and operative risk.DOI: 10.1017/S0029665118000423 PMID: 29860952
