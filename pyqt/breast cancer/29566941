Electronic address:jipark@dau.ac.kr.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and PPARγ coactivator-1α(PGC-1α) expression levels are correlated with clinical outcome in breast cancer.However, the potential biological and clinical significance of PPARγ and PGC-1αin colorectal cancer remains unknown. Here we investigated PPARγ and PGC-1αexpression in colorectal cancer, and the associations of these expression levels with clinicopathological features. We also evaluated the roles of PPARγ andPGC-1α as prognostic factors in colorectal cancer. We performedimmunohistochemical analysis to investigate PPARγ and PGC-1α expression in human colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 108 primary colorectalcancer patients. We then examined how these expression levels correlated withclinicopathological features. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we evaluated 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with tumorsexpressing different levels of PPARγ and PGC-1α. Our results revealed that PPARγ expression was not significantly correlated with age at surgery, gender,differentiation, depth of infiltration, relapse, or TNM stage. Additionally,PGC-1α expression was not significantly correlated with age at surgery,differentiation, depth of infiltration, relapse, or TNM stage. However, PGC-1αexpression was significantly correlated with nodal metastasis (p=0.020). Survivalanalysis demonstrated reduced OS in the PGC-1α-positive group compared to thePGC-1α-negative group (p=0.03). Our present findings suggest that PGC-1α may beuseful for predicting nodal metastasis, and may represent a biomarker for poorprognosis in colorectal cancer.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
