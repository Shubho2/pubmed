In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in wild-type and transporter knockout miceshowed that two major BBB efflux transporters, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breastcancer resistance protein (Bcrp), cooperate to modulate the brain exposure ofponatinib. The total and unbound (free) brain-to-plasma ratios were approximately15-fold higher in the triple knockout mice lacking both P-gp and Bcrp[Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-)] compared with the wild-type mice. The triple knockoutmice had a greater than an additive increase in the brain exposure of ponatinibwhen compared with single knockout mice [Bcrp1(-/-) or Mdr1a/b(-/-)], suggesting functional compensation of transporter-mediated drug efflux. Based on the BBBmodel characterizing the observed brain and plasma concentration-time profiles,the brain exit rate constant and clearance out of the brain were approximately15-fold higher in the wild-type compared with Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice,resulting in a significant increase in the mean transit time (the average timespent by ponatinib in the brain in a single passage) in the absence of effluxtransporters (P-gp and Bcrp). This study characterized transporter-mediated drug efflux from the brain, a process that reduces the duration and extent ofponatinib exposure in the brain and has critical implications for the use oftargeted drug delivery for brain tumors.Copyright Â© 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/jpet.117.246116 PMCID: PMC5878676 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29440450
