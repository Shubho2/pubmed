It is the second leadingcause of death due to cancer among women. Currently, however, no diagnosticblood-based biomarker exists to identify the early stages of TNBC. To addressthis point, we utilized a human protein microarray system to identify serumautoantibodies that showed different expression patterns between TNBC and normal serum samples, and identified five autoantibodies showing TNBC-specificexpression. Among them, we selected the thioredoxin-like 2 (TXNL2) autoantibodyand evaluated its diagnostic relevance by dot blot analysis with the recombinant TXNL2 protein. We demonstrated that the TXNL2 autoantibody showed 2- to 6-foldhigher expression in TNBC samples than in normal samples suggesting that serumTXNL2 autoantibodies are potential biomarkers for TNBC.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.1.87 PMCID: PMC5880970PMID: 29628988
