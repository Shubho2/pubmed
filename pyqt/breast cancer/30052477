We describe FGD5 expression, assessassociations between FGD5 amplification and FGD5 expression, and assess FGD5expression in relation to proliferation and prognosis. FGD5 immunohistochemistry was done on primary tumors ( n=829) and lymph node metastases ( n=231) from acohort of Norwegian patients. We explored associations between FGD5amplification, FGD5 expression, and proliferation, and analyzed the prognosticvalue of FGD5 expression by estimating cumulative risks of death and hazardratios (HRs). We identified nuclear and cytoplasmic expression in 64% and 73% of primary tumors, respectively, and found an association between gene amplificationand nuclear expression ( p=0.02). The proportion of cases with FGD5 expressionwas higher in lymph node metastases, compared with primary tumors ( p=0.004 fornuclear and p=0.001 for cytoplasmic staining). Neither proliferation norprognosis was associated with FGD5 expression (age-adjusted HR 1.12 [95%confidence interval = 0.89-1.41] for nuclear expression; and 0.88 [95% CI =0.70-1.12] for cytoplasmic expression). FGD5 is expressed in a high proportion ofbreast cancers and lymph node metastases. There was a correlation between FGD5amplification and nuclear expression, but no association between FGD5 expression and proliferation or prognosis.DOI: 10.1369/0022155418792032 PMID: 30052477
