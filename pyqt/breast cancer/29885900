Here, multifunctionalnanoplatforms were utilized in miRNA-101 delivery and NIR thermal therapy toinduce apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Au nanorods (NRs) or nanospheres (NSs)covered with graphene oxide (GO) were prepared and functionalized withpolyethylene glycol as a stabilizer and poly-L-arginine (P-L-Arg) as a targeting agent. In nanoplatforms, coupling Au@GO prepared stable structures with higherNIR reactivity. P-L-Arg substantially enhanced the cellular uptake and generetardation of stuffs coated by them. However, rod-shape nanoplatforms indicated better performance in cellular uptake and gene transfection than spherical ones. NIR thermal therapy was implemented to improve gene release and in synergy withmiRNA-101 activated the apoptotic pathway and decreased the viability of breastcancer cell (<20%). Briefly, presented delivery systems are potentially efficientin distinguishing cancer cells, miRNA internalization and controlling apoptosisof cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
