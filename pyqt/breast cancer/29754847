The purpose of this study was to assess thefeasibility of immunohistochemistry (IHC) surrogate panel in classifying the TNBCmolecular subtypes using a large cohort of TNBC retrieved from a singleinstitution.MATERIALS AND METHODS: IHC for androgen receptor [AR], claudin-3, E-cadherin,cytokeratin 5/6 [CK5/6], epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase 1 [IDO1], and Forkhead box C1 [FOXC1] were performed using thetissue microarray constructed from 200 TNBC samples.RESULTS: The 200 TNBCs were classified as LAR (AR+, n = 22; 11.0%), MES (claudin 3- and/or E-cadherin-, n = 23; 11.5%), basal-like (CK5/6+ and/or EGFR+, n = 85;42.5%), mixed (n = 60; 30%), and unclassifiable type (n = 10; 5%). LAR type wasassociated with older patient age, apocrine histologic features, low density ofstromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and low Ki-67 labeling index. MEStype was associated with tumor cell discohesiveness and metaplastic features.Basal-like type was associated with younger patient age, high histologic grade,high stromal TIL density, and high Ki-67 labeling index. Basal-like TNBCs werefurther classified as BLIA (IDO1+ and FOXC1-, n = 27) or BLIS type (IDO1- andFOXC1+, n = 11). BLIS type was associated with large tumor size and low stromalTIL density, which had the worst prognostic outcome among 4 subtypes.CONCLUSION: The IHC surrogate panel may define TNBC subtypes with distinctclinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic significance.Copyright © 2018.
