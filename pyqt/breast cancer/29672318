Epub 2018 Apr 19.A Novel 2-Methoxyestradiol Analogue Is Responsible for Vesicle Disruption andLysosome Aggregation in Breast Cancer Cells.Nkandeu SD(1), van den Bout I(1)(2), Cronjé MJ(3), van Papendorp DH(1), JoubertAM(1).Author information: (1)Department of Physiology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.(2)Centre for Neuroendocrinology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.(3)Department of Biochemistry, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, SouthAfrica.BACKGROUND: 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is an endogenous metabolite of17-β-estradiol with anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties. Due to2ME2's rapid metabolism and low oral bioavailability in in vivo settings, 2ME2analogues have been designed to alleviate these issues. One of these compounds is2-ethyl-3-O-sulphamoyl-estra-1,3,5(10)16-tetraene (ESE-16). A previous workalluded to the ability of ESE-16 to induce autophagic cell death. Therefore, weinvestigated the mode of action of ESE-16 by studying its effects on autophagy,vesicle formation, and lysosomal organisation.SUMMARY: Vesicle formation and autophagy induction were analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining and Lysotrackerstaining, while autophagosome turnover was analysed using microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3 lipidation) analysis. MDC staining of acidicvesicles revealed an increase both in the number and size of vesicles afterESE-16 exposure. This was confirmed by TEM. Lysotracker staining indicated anincrease in the size of lysosomes, as well as changes in their distributionwithin the cell. However, autophagy was not induced, since LC3 lipidation did notincrease after exposure to ESE-16. Key -Messages: This study showed that ESE-16exposure leads to the aggregation of acidic vesicles, identified as lysosomes,not accompanied by an induction of autophagy. Therefore, ESE-16 disrupts normalendocytic vesicle maturation likely through the inhibition of the microtubulefunction.© 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.DOI: 10.1159/000487443 PMID: 29672318
