Electronic address: suresh@iict.res.in.A new series of Schizandrin (1) derivatives were synthesized utilizing the C-9position of the Schizandrin core and evaluated for their cytotoxic activitiesagainst HeLa (cervical cancer), A549 (lung cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer) andDU-145 (prostate cancer) cell lines. Among the synthesized series, 4e, 4f, 4g and5 showed potent activities against tested cell lines. More significantly,compound 5 exhibited most potent cytotoxic activity against DU-145 with an IC50value of 1.38 μM which is comparable to the standard agent, doxorubicin. Further,flow cytometry analysis indicated that 5 arrested cells in G2/M phase andconsequently leading to apoptosis. Molecular docking analysis showed that 5occupied the colchicine binding pocket of tubulin. Overall, the present studydemonstrates that 5, as a mitotic-agent.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
