New trends are emerging now: on the one hand, with respect to the geographical BC prevalence and, on the other hand, with respect to the age distribution. Recent statistics demonstratethat young populations are getting more and more affected by BC in both Easternand Western countries. Therefore, the old rule "the older the age, the higher theBC risk" is getting relativised now. Accumulated evidence shows that youngpremenopausal women deal with particularly unpredictable subtypes of BC such astriple-negative BC, have lower survival rates and respond less to conventionalchemotherapy compared to the majority of postmenopausal BC.Working hypothesis: Here we hypothesised that a multi-level diagnostic approachmay lead to the identification of a molecular signature highly specific for thepremenopausal BC. A multi-omic approach using machine learning was considered as a potent tool for stratifying patients with benign breast alterations intowell-defined risk groups, namely individuals at high versus low risk for breastcancer development.Results and conclusions: The study resulted in identifying multi-omic signaturespecific for the premenopausal BC that can be used for stratifying patients with benign breast alterations. Our predictive model is capable of discriminatingindividually between high and low BC-risk with high confidence (>90%) andconsidered of potential clinical utility. Novel risk assessment approaches andadvanced screening programmes-as the long-term target of this project-are ofparticular importance for predictive, preventive and personalised medicine as themedicine of the future, due to the expected health benefits for youngsubpopulations and the healthcare system as a whole.DOI: 10.1007/s13167-018-0131-0 PMCID: PMC5972143 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29896316
