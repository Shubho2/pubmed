IC50s were found for all eight stereoisomers rangingfrom a low of 4.0 nM for THL to a high of 930 nM for the diastereomer with theinverted stereocenters at the 2,3,2'-positions. While the enantiomer of THL wasalso significantly less active (77 nM) the remaining five stereoisomers retained significant inhibitory activities (IC50s = 8.0 to 20 nM). All eight compoundswere also evaluated against three human cancer cell lines (human breast cancersMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, human large-cell lung carcinoma H460). No appreciablecytotoxicity was observed for THL and its seven diastereomers, as their IC50s in a MTT cytotoxicity assay were all greater than 3 orders of magnitude ofcamptothecin.DOI: 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.8b00050 PMCID: PMC5846039 [Available on 2019-03-08]PMID: 29541373
