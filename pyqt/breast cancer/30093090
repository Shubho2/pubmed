This article aims to provide anoverview of the evidence.METHODS: A search of the literature was conducted via MEDLINE using appropriatekeywords. Eligible studies were screened and relevant articles were selected for this report.RESULTS: Studies investigating the role of extended adjuvant tamoxifen beyond 5years have revealed mixed results depending on the proportion of node positivity.In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for 5 years are superior totamoxifen. Extending the use of AIs beyond 5 years seem to reduce the risk ofrelapse in postmenopausal women with node positive disease. The addition ofbisphosphonates to counteract AI-related osteopenia may further improve overalland disease-free survival. Women younger than 40 years seem to benefit fromovarian suppression combined with tamoxifen or exemestane.CONCLUSIONS: An individualised approach is required for every patient. Theadverse effects of endocrine therapy should be weighed against the potentialbenefits of extended therapy to better inform decision-making.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
