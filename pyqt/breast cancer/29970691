China.Objective: We aim to investigate whether the breast cancer metastasis suppressor gene, breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1), is correlated withclinicopathological features of breast cancer or not.Materials and Methods: Following a stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria,case-control studies related to the association between BRMS1 and breast cancerwere selected from articles retrieved by electronic database searches. Allstatistical analyses were performed by Stata version 12.0 (Stata Corp, CollegeStation, TX, USA).Results: A total of 12 studies were ultimately included in this meta-analysis.Results of our meta-analysis suggested that BRMS1 protein in breast cancertissues was significantly lower compared with normal breast tissues (odds ratio[OR] =0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] =0.04-0.15, P < 0.001). The BRMS1protein in metastatic breast cancer tissue was lower than that in nonmetastaticbreast cancer tissue (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.13-0.29, P < 0.001), and BRMS1protein in tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages 1, 2 was found to be higher thanTNM stages 3, 4 (OR = 4.62, 95% CI = 2.77-7.70, P < 0.001). With respect tobreast cancer types, BRMS1 protein in all the three major types of breast cancer was lower than the normal tissues. We also found strong correlations betweenBRMS1 mRNA levels and TNM stage and tumor size.Conclusion: Our meta-analysis results showed that reduced BRMS1 expression level was significantly associated with clinicopathological features of breast cancer, suggesting that loss of expression or reduced levels of BRMS1 might be a strongindicator of the metastatic capacity of breast cancer, with poor prognosis.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.172125 PMID: 29970691
