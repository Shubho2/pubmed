Four SWE images in two orthogonal planes were obtained. Maximumgreyscale US diameter and maximum diameter of lesion enhancement on MRI weremeasured. Percentage reductions between baseline and post-treatment scans werecalculated for MRI and greyscale US diameter, and Emean, Emax, and SD. Thepercentage reduction in Emean and US diameter were also analysed as acombination. Analysis was undertaken using receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curves and the chi-squared test.RESULTS: pCR occurred in 21 of 80 (26%) women. The area under the ROC curve (AUC)for pCR of percentage reductions in Emean, Emax, SD, and greyscale US diameterwere 0.89, 0.85, 0.75, and 0.86, respectively. The combination of percentagereductions in Emean and greyscale ultrasound diameter yielded an AUC of 0.92,which is similar to the AUC for MRI of 0.96 (p=0.28).CONCLUSIONS: SWE combined with greyscale US shows promise for end-of-treatmentidentification of response to NACT in women with breast cancer, with accuraciessimilar to breast MRI. This technique could be used to inform surgicaldecision-making after NACT.Copyright Â© 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
