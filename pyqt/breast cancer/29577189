Epub 2018 Mar 26.Effect of Various Treatment Modes of Experimental Mammary Gland Tumor onStructure of Anterior Mediastinal Lymph Nodes.Kazakov OV(1), Kabakov AV(2), Poveshchenko AF(2), Raiter TV(2), Strunkin DN(2),Bogachev SS(2), Ishchenko IY(2), Lykov AP(2), Michurina SV(2), Konenkov VI(2).Author information: (1)Research Institute of Experimental and Clinical Lymphology, Novosibirsk,Russia. kazakoff_oleg@mail.ru.(2)Research Institute of Experimental and Clinical Lymphology, Novosibirsk,Russia.The effects of various treatment modes on the morphology of anterior mediastinal lymph nodes were examined in female Wistar rats with chemically provoked breastcancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy impaired filtration barrier potential of theanterior mediastinal lymph nodes, which manifested in increased volume ofsinuses, reduced volumes of lymphoid nodules with germinal centers andthymus-dependent regions, down-regulated proliferative activity of lymphoid cellsin B-cell zone and paracortex, and diminished macrophage score in all zones.Intraperitoneal injection of double-stranded DNA preparation (5 mg/kg) activated the humoral and cellular immune responses manifested by morphological alterationsin anterior mediastinal lymph nodes observed in parallel with a decrease ofmedullary sinuses volume: enhancement of lymphocyte volume and lymphocyte scorein paracortex, mantle zone expansion, and an increase of volume of the lightcenters in lymphoid nodules paralleled with diminished proliferative activity in them.DOI: 10.1007/s10517-018-4054-5 PMID: 29577189
