We investigated the positive and negative predictivevalues (PPV and NPV) of breath VOC biomarkers as indicators of breast cancerrisk.METHODS: We employed ultra-clean breath collection balloons to collect breathsamples from 54 women with biopsy-proven breast cancer and 124 cancer-freecontrols. Breath VOCs were analyzed with gas chromatography (GC) combined witheither mass spectrometry (GC MS) or surface acoustic wave detection (GC SAW).Chromatograms were randomly assigned to a training set or a validation set. MonteCarlo analysis identified significant breath VOC biomarkers of breast cancer inthe training set, and these biomarkers were incorporated into a multivariatealgorithm to predict disease in the validation set. In the unsplit dataset, thepredictive algorithms generated discriminant function (DF) values that variedwith sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV.RESULTS: Using GC MS, test accuracy = 90% (area under curve of receiver operatingcharacteristic in unsplit dataset) and cross-validated accuracy = 77%. Using GCSAW, test accuracy = 86% and cross-validated accuracy = 74%. With both assays, a low DF value was associated with a low risk of breast cancer (NPV > 99.9%). Ahigh DF value was associated with a high risk of breast cancer and PPV rising to 100%.CONCLUSION: Analysis of breath VOC samples collected with ultra-clean balloonsdetected biomarkers that accurately predicted risk of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4764-4 PMID: 29569019
