Metaplasticcarcinomas were found to be of higher grade as compared to IDC, NOS as 81% ofmetaplastic carcinoma were grade III compared to 35% IDC, NOS. 79% of metaplasticcarcinoma were ER negative and 86% were PR negative, respectively as compared to ductal carcinoma NOS, which were 40% ER negative and 54% were PR. Similarly,86.7% micropapillary cancers were ER positive and 73.3% were PR positive.Moreover, 66.7% micropapillary carcinoma showed nodal metastasis and 77.8% showedlymphovascular invasion, which was significantly higher than that of IDC, NOSmicropapillary and metaplastic carcinomas accounts for less than 2 and 1% of the breast cancer burden in our population and highly correlates with poor prognosis parameters therefore, require more intensive management in our population.DOI: 10.1186/s13104-018-3623-z PMCID: PMC6069771PMID: 30064485
