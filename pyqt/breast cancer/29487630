Ripamonti 435,20141 Milan, Italy.Breast fibromatosis, also referred to as desmoid tumor or aggressivefibromatosis, is a very rare, locally aggressive disease that does notmetastasize. Bilateral lesions are extremely rare and are found in only 4% ofpatients with breast fibromatosis. Tumor recurrence following surgery occurs in18%-29% of patients, most often within the first 2 years after surgery. In thisreport, we discuss a case of breast fibromatosis, mimicking a breast carcinomaboth clinically and radiologically, that presented clinically with dimpling ofthe skin of the left breast in a 31-year-old woman.
