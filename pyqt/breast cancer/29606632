Demographic information andbaseline anxiety were queried. Participants were presented with scenarios ofshort-term imaging follow-up recommendations (ie, BI-RADS 3) and biopsyrecommendations (ie, BI-RADS 4A) for low-risk mammographic abnormalities andasked to estimate their breast cancer risk for each scenario. Participantsreported the threshold (ie, likelihood of cancer) where they would feelcomfortable undergoing short-term imaging follow-up and biopsy and theiranticipated regret for choosing short-term follow-up versus biopsy.RESULTS: Analysis of 2,747 surveys showed that participants estimated breastcancer risk of 32.8% for a BI-RADS 3 and 41.1% for a BI-RADS 4A scenarios aresignificantly greater rates than clinically established rates (<2% [P < .001] and2%-10% [P < .001], respectively). Over one-half (55.4%) of participants reported they would never want imaging follow-up if there was any chance of cancer;two-thirds (66.2%) reported they would desire biopsy if there was any chance ofcancer. Participants reported greater anticipated regret (P < .001) and lessrelief and confidence (P < .001) with the decision to undergo follow-up imagingversus biopsy.CONCLUSION: Women overestimate breast cancer risk associated with both BI-RADS 3 and 4A scenarios and desire very low biopsy thresholds. Greater anticipatedregret and less relief and confidence was reported with the choice to undergoshort-term imaging follow-up compared with biopsy.Copyright Â© 2018 American College of Radiology.
