Cytotoxic chemotherapy represents the current treatment forTNBC. However, relapse and chemo-resistance are very frequent. Therefore, newtherapeutic approaches that are able to increase the sensitivity to cytotoxicdrugs are needed. Forskolin, a natural cAMP elevating agent, has been used forseveral centuries in medicine and its safeness has also been demonstrated inmodern studies. Recently, forskolin is emerging as a possible novel molecule for cancer therapy. Here, we investigate the effects of forskolin on the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells to doxorubicin through MTT assay, flowcytometry-based assays (cell-cycle progression and cell death), cell numbercounting and immunoblotting experiments. We demonstrate that forskolin stronglyenhances doxorubicin-induced antiproliferative effects by cell death induction.Similar effects are observed with IBMX and isoproterenol cAMP elevating agentsand 8-Br-cAMP analog, but not by using 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP Epac activator. It is important to note that the forskolin-induced potentiation of sensitivity todoxorubicin is accompanied by a strong inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, ismimicked by ERK inhibitor PD98059 and is prevented by pre-treatment with Protein Kinase A (PKA) and adenylate cyclase inhibitors. Altogether, our data indicatethat forskolin sensitizes TNBC cells to doxorubicin via a mechanism depending on the cAMP/PKA-mediated ERK inhibition. Our findings sustain the evidence ofanticancer activity mediated by forskolin and encourage the design of futurein-vivo/clinical studies in order to explore forskolin as a doxorubicinsensitizer for possible use in TNBC patients.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
