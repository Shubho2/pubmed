Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus(a member of the retrovirus family) that causes acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome. It is yet unknown what is the impact of HIV to the onset andprogression of bone disease in BC. The purpose of the study was to determine the association of HIV infection and skeletal metastases in BC using skeletalscintigraphy. A retrospective analysis of 25 female BC patients' bone scans wasperformed. The 25 bone scans of 12 patients known HIV positive and 13 patientswho were known HIV negative, of similar age and histology, were compared. All 13 HIV negative patients had a positive bone scan. Of the 12 HIV-positive patients, 4 patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) had positive bonescans for skeletal metastases. The remaining eight HIV-positive patients hadnegative bone scans, of which six were on HAART and two were not on HAART. In ourstudy, HIV infection was not found to be a contributing risk factor for skeletal metastases. From our small series, it appears that HIV patients and on HAART havea delay in the onset of skeletal metastases in BC.DOI: 10.4103/wjnm.WJNM_58_17 PMCID: PMC6034540PMID: 30034282
