[Epub ahead of print]Sensitivity and Isoform Specificity of 18F-Fluorofuranylnorprogesterone forMeasuring Progesterone Receptor Protein Response to Estradiol Challenge in BreastCancer.Salem K(1), Kumar M(1), Yan Y(1), Jeffery JJ(1), Kloepping KC(1), Michel CJ(1),Powers GL(1), Mahajan AM(1), Fowler AM(1).Author information: (1)University of Wisconsin-Madison, United States.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of21-18F-fluoro-16α,17α-[(R)-(1'-α-furylmethylidene)dioxy]-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (18F-FFNP) to measure alterations in progesterone receptor (PR) proteinlevel and isoform expression in response to estradiol challenge. Methods: T47Dhuman breast cancer cells and female mice-bearing T47D tumor xenografts weretreated with 17β-estradiol (E2) to increase PR expression. 18F-FFNP uptake wasmeasured using cell uptake and tissue biodistribution assays. MDA-MB-231 breastcancer clonal cell lines were generated that express the A or B isoforms of humanPR. PR protein levels, transcriptional function, and subcellular localizationwere determined. In vitro 18F-FFNP binding was measured via saturation andcompetitive binding curves. In vivo 18F-FFNP uptake was measured using tumorxenografts and positron emission tomography. Statistical significance wasdetermined using analysis of variance and t-tests. Results: After 48 and 72 h of E2, 18F-FFNP uptake in T47D cells was maximally increased compared to bothvehicle and 24 h E2 treatment (p<0.0001 vs ethanol; P = 0.02 and P = 0.0002 vs 24h for 48 and 72 h, respectively). T47D tumor xenografts in mice treated with 72 hE2 had maximal 18F-FFNP uptake compared to ethanol-treated mice (11.3±1.4 vs5.2±0.81 %ID/g; P = 0.002). Corresponding tumor-to-muscle uptake ratios were4.1±0.6, 3.9±0.5, and 2.3±0.4 for 48 h E2, 72 h E2, and ethanol-treated mice,respectively. There was no significant preferential 18F-FFNP binding or uptake byPR-A versus PR-B in the PR isoform-specific cell lines and tumor xenografts.Conclusion:18F-FFNP is capable of measuring estrogen-induced shifts in total PRexpression in human breast cancer cells and tumor xenografts with equivalentisoform binding.Copyright © 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.211516 PMID: 30030339
