However, the role of FLRT2 in theadult hippocampus and its relevance in sex-dependent brain functions remainsunknown. We here used adult single-allele FLRT2 knockout (FLRT2+/-) mice andbehavioral, electrophysiological, and molecular/biological assays to examine the effects of FLRT2 haplodeficiency on synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependentlearning and memory. Female and male FLRT2+/- mice presented morphologicalfeatures (including body masses, brain shapes/weights, and brain macroscopiccytoarchitectonic organization), indistinguishable from their wild typecounterparts. However, in vivo examinations unveiled enhancedhippocampus-dependent spatial memory recall in female FLRT2+/- animals,concomitant with augmented hippocampal synaptic plasticity and decreased levelsof the glutamate transporter EAAT2 and beta estrogen receptors. In contrast, maleFLRT2+/- animals exhibited deficient memory recall and decreased alpha estrogenreceptor levels. These observations propose that FLRT2 can regulate memoryfunctions in the adulthood in a sex-specific manner and might thus contribute to further research on the mechanisms linking sexual dimorphism and cognition.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22030-4 PMCID: PMC5829229PMID: 29487336
