The mostcommon sites of EMH are liver and spleen, but it has been documented in otherorgans such as the mediastinum, lymph nodes, breast, and central nervous system. EMH occurs as a compensatory mechanism for bone marrow dysfunction in severethalassemia. We report a case of EMH presenting as a posterior mediastinal massin a 34-year-old woman with thalassemia intermedia with chronic cough andshortness of breath on exertion. The diagnosis of EMH was confirmed by aCT-guided fine needle biopsy. All symptoms disappeared after surgical removal of the mass.PMID: 29451228
