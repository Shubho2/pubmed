R. China. yunfenglin@scu.edu.cn.Paclitaxel (PTX) is an effective drug against diseases such as lung cancer,ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. However, multidrug resistance limits theclinical applications of this drug. Tetrahedral DNA nanostructures (TDNs) offergreat promise as a drug delivery candidate. In our study, we prepared TDNs thatwere subsequently loaded with PTX (PTX/TDNs). The cytotoxicity of PTX/TDNs andPTX alone on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (A549) and thePTX-resistant cell line (A549/T) was determined using a cell count kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. PTX/TDNs exerted strong lethality on both cell lines. Moreover, drugresistance was overcome. Furthermore, the mechanisms used by PTX/TDNs to overcomedrug resistance were studied. The expression of mdr 1 gene and P-glycoprotein(P-gp) in A549/T was found to be downregulated, thus indicating that TDNs serveas a P-gp inhibitor. We also showed that PTX/TDNs killed cancer cells viaapoptosis. Thus, PTX/TDNs have great potential for use as a nanodelivery systemfor the treatment of PTX-resistant NSCLC.DOI: 10.1039/c7nr09692e PMID: 29484330
