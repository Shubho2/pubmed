In this study, we first confirmed that the expression levels of LRIG1were much lower in NSCLC than in non-malignant cells or tissues. Next, we focusedon the effect of LRIG1 in NSCLC. For this purpose, we established clones stablyoverexpressing LRIG1, using EGFR-mutant (HCC827, HCC4011 and NCI-H1975) andwild-type (A549) cells. Transfection of LRIG1 was associated with a decrease inthe expression and phosphorylation levels of EGFR in the HCC827, HCC4011 andNCI-H1975 cells. It was also associated with strong suppression of the cellproliferative, invasive, migratory and tumorigenic potential of the HCC827 cells.On the other hand, no such effects were observed in the A549 cells. In addition, LRIG1 also downregulated the expression and phosphorylation levels of othertyrosine kinase receptors, such as HER2, HER3, MET and IGF-1R, and prevented the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by TGF-Î² in the HCC827 cells. These findings suggest that LRIG1 exerts important tumor-suppressive effects inEGFR-mutant NSCLC and has the potential to become a novel therapeutic target for EGFR-mutant NSCLC.DOI: 10.1093/carcin/bgy044 PMID: 29546323
