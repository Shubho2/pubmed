Anoikis resistance is a key process during tumor metastasis, which isusually accompanied with metabolism reprogram. In this study, we established ananchorage independent growth model for MDA-MB-231 cells and investigated thechanges in metabolism and redox homeostasis. Results showed that duringdetached-growth, MDA-MB-231 cells tend to generate ATP through fatty acidoxidation (FAO), instead of glycolysis. Amount of glucose was used for pentosephosphate pathway (PPP) to keep redox balance. Moreover, we discovered that asynthesized flavonoid derivative GL-V9, exhibited a potent inhibitory effect onthe anchorage independent growth of TNBCs in vitro and anti-metastasis effect in vivo. In terms of the mechanism, GL-V9 could promote the expression and activity of AMPK, leading to the decrease of G6PD and the increase of p-ACC. Thus, thelevel of PPP was suppressed, whereas FAO was highly enhanced. The reprogram ofglycolipid metabolism destroyed the redox balance ultimately and induced celldeath. This paper indicated a novel regulating mechanism of redox homeostasisinvolving with glycolipid metabolism, and provided a potential candidate for the anti-metastatic therapy of TNBCs.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
