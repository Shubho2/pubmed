Elevated oncogenic activity ofYAP1 has been clarified in different types of human cancers, which contributes tocancer cell survival and chemoresistance. However, the molecular mechanism ofYAP1 overexpression in cancer is still not clear. Here we demonstrate that thedeubiquitination enzyme USP9X deubiquitinates and stabilizes YAP1, therebypromoting cancer cell survival. Increased USP9X expression correlates withincreased YAP1 protein in human breast cancer cell lines and patient samples.Moreover, depletion of USP9X increases YAP1 polyubiquitination, which in turnelevates YAP1 turnover and cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. Overall, our studyestablishes the USP9X-YAP1 axis as an important regulatory mechanism of breastcancer and provides a rationale for potential therapeutic interventions in thetreatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0134-2 PMCID: PMC5940338 [Available on 2018-08-16]PMID: 29449692
