We evaluated theprognostic impact of 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) prior to treatment inpatients with breast cancer.METHODS: Forty-four patients with stage II/III primary breast cancer underwentpositron emission tomography/computed with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET/CT)and FMISO. After measurement by FDG-PET/CT, the tissue-to-blood ratio (TBR) wasobtained using FMISO-PET/CT. FMISO-TBR was compared for correlation withclinicopathological factors, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival(OS). Multiplex cytokines were analyzed for the correlation of FMISO-TBR.RESULTS: Tumors with higher nuclear grade and negativities of estrogen receptor(ER) and progesterone receptor had significantly higher FMISO-TBR than othertumors. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with a higher FMISO-TBR(cutoff, 1.48) had a poorer prognosis of DFS (p = 0.0007) and OS (p = 0.04) than those with a lower FMISO-TBR. Multivariate analysis indicated that higherFMISO-TBR and ER negativity were independent predictors of shorter DFS (p = 0.01 and 0.03). Higher FMISO-TBR was associated with higher plasma levels ofangiogenic hypoxic markers such as vascular endothelial growth factor,transforming growth factor-α, and interleukin 8.CONCLUSIONS: FMISO-PET/CT is useful for assessing the prognosis of patients with breast cancer, but it should be stratified by ER status.TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000006802 .
