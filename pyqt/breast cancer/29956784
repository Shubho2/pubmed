China.The management of patients with triple‑negative breast cancer is challenging due to the lack of effective therapeutic options, aggressive behavior and relatively poor prognosis. Xi Huang pills (XHP) are a well‑known traditional Chinesemedicine that demonstrate anticancer activities. The aim of the present study wasto investigate the antitumor effects of XHP on MDA‑MB‑231 cells in vitro andin vivo, and its potential underlying molecular mechanisms. In the present study,an MTT assay was used to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of XHP onMDA‑MB‑231 cells. In order to investigate the effects further, cell cycledistribution, apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential assays wereperformed, as well as western blot analyses. In addition, a tumor xenograft modelwas employed to investigate the effects of XHP in vivo. The results of the MTTassay demonstrated that the viability of MDA‑MB‑231 cells was markedly inhibited by XHP in a dose‑ and time‑dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of XHP on the viability of MDA‑MB‑231 cells was greater when compared with MCF‑10A cells. Anincrease in apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was observedfollowing 4, 8 and 12 mg/ml XHP treatment of MDA‑MB‑231 cells. The proteinexpression levels of cleaved caspase‑3 were increased by 1.62‑, 2.13‑ and2.19‑fold, respectively, when compared with the untreated controls, whereas noeffects on the expression of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) or Bcl‑2‑associated Xprotein (Bax) were observed. The results of the cell cycle distribution assayanalysis demonstrated that XHP treatment arrested cells at the G2/M phase. Inaddition, XHP treatment decreased the expression of cyclin A and increased theexpression of p21Cip1. In vivo experiments revealed that XHP inhibited the growthof MDA‑MB‑231 xenograft tumors without body weight loss, and demonstrated similareffects on the protein expression levels of cleaved caspase 3, cyclin A andp21Cip1 as observed in vitro. In conclusion, the viability of MDA‑MB‑231 cellswas inhibited by XHP in a dose‑dependent, time‑dependent and cell‑selectivemanner in vitro, and the potential underlying mechanisms may involve apoptosisand cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. XHP may induce apoptosis in MDA‑MB‑231cells via the intrinsic pathway, which does not involve the Bcl‑2/Bax ratio. G2/Mphase arrest may have been due to the integrated action of decreased cyclin Aexpression and increased p21Cip1 expression. In addition, XHP inhibited thegrowth of xenograft tumors in the absence of body weight loss in vivo.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9203 PMCID: PMC6072179PMID: 29956784
