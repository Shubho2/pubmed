This study examined associations between weight changes and weight cycling on psychological health (i.e. weight-related guilt,shame and depressive symptoms) among women in the first-year post-treatment.DESIGN AND OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported assessments of pre-cancer weightcycling, post-treatment weight-related guilt, shame and depressive symptoms, and objective assessments of weight were assessed in a longitudinal sample of 173women treated for breast cancer (Mage = 55.01 ± 10.96 years).RESULTS: Based on findings from multilevel models, women experienced the mostweight-related shame when their weight was heavier than their personal average.Additionally, heavier weight was associated with worse psychological health,particularly for women with a history of stable (vs. cycling) weight pre-cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Weight cycling pre-cancer and post-treatment weight change haveimportant implications for psychological well-being. Due to the potentialpsychological consequences associated with a history of weight cycling, targeted strategies are needed to improve overall health outcomes for women's survivorshipafter breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/08870446.2018.1453510 PMID: 29600881
