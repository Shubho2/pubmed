Electronic address: mroyce@mroycemdphd.com.Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is the leading cause of cancer-related morbidityand mortality among women worldwide. Endocrine therapy is the standard of carefor the most common subtype of MBC, hormone-receptor positive (HR+), humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) disease. Advances in treatingthis type of MBC have focused on improving the efficacy of endocrine therapy byadding agents that target specific molecular pathways of breast cancer cellgrowth and survival. The combination of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane andthe mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, everolimus, more than doubled medianprogression-free survival compared with exemestane alone (7.8 vs 3.2 months,respectively; hazard ratio 0.45 [95% confidence interval 0.38-0.54]; log rankP < 0.0001) in the BOLERO-2 study in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- locallyadvanced or metastatic breast cancer that had recurred or progressed on priornon-steroidal aromatase inhibitor therapy. In addition, everolimus plusexemestane was associated with a manageable safety profile. The results ofBOLERO-2 led to regulatory approval of everolimus plus exemestane. Additionaleverolimus-based combinations have been or are under investigation in the HR+,HER2- MBC setting, including combinations with letrozole, fulvestrant,ribociclib, tamoxifen, and chemotherapy. This review summarizes key data oneverolimus-based combinations focusing on efficacy, safety, biomarkers, qualityof life, and health economic outcomes. These data are discussed in the context ofthe changing MBC treatment algorithm to provide insights into the clinicalrelevance of everolimus-based combinations.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
