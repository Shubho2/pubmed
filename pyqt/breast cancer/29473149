Flockhart.Skaar TC(1), Desta Z(1).Author information: (1)Indiana University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division ofClinical Pharmacology, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.This issue of Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics (CPT) includes the ClinicalPharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for using CYP2D6genotyping to guide tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer patients. CYP2D6metabolizes tamoxifen to its more active metabolite, endoxifen, and patients withreduced CYP2D6 activity have reduced circulating endoxifen concentrations. Inthis associated commentary, we recognize and honor the late Dr. David Flockhart, who began the research and made early fundamental discoveries on tamoxifen thathave now resulted in this guideline.Â© 2018 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.DOI: 10.1002/cpt.1039 PMID: 29473149
