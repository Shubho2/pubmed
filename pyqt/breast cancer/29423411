Epub 2017 Dec 20.HPV Status and Its Correlation with BCL2, p21, p53, Rb, and Survivin Expressionin Breast Cancer in a Chinese Population.Wang YW(1), Zhang K(1), Zhao S(1), Lv Y(1), Zhu J(1), Liu H(1), Feng J(2), Liang W(1), Ma R(1), Wang J(3).Author information: (1)Department of Breast Surgery, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan,Shandong, China.(2)Gene Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Qilu Hospital ofShandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.(3)Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan,Shandong, China.Despite recent evidence, the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in breastcarcinogenesis is controversial. The correlations of HPV infection with theclinicopathological features of breast cancer and the expression of cellcycle/apoptosis-associated proteins have not been well elucidated. In this study,we sought to determine the prevalence of high-risk HPVs (HR-HPVs) infection andBCL2, p21, p53, Rb, and survivin expression in breast cancer patients and toinvestigate the relationship of HPV with these cancer-related proteins, in anattempt to clarify the potential mechanism of HPV in breast cancer pathogenesis. HPV presence in 81 fresh breast cancer tissues was determined by hybrid capture 2(HC2) assay, and expression of BCL2, p21, p53, Rb, and survivin was detected byimmunohistochemistry. Here we showed that fourteen (17.3%) patients were HR-HPVpositive. HPV infection demonstrated no significant correlation with theclinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer. HPV-positive tumors showed significantly higher BCL2 and lower p53 expression than HPV-negative tumors.Expression of p21, Rb, and survivin was not associated with HPV status. Ourresults suggest a possible role of HR-HPV in breast cancer carcinogenesis, inwhich BCL2 and p53 may be involved.DOI: 10.1155/2017/6315392 PMCID: PMC5750508PMID: 29423411
