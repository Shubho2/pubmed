Overexpression of SNAI1 or ZEB1 inepithelial MCF7 cells activated EMT and upregulated CD47 while siRNA-mediatedtargeting of SNAI1 or ZEB1 in mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cells reversed EMT andstrongly decreased CD47. Mechanistically, SNAI1 and ZEB1 upregulated CD47 bybinding directly to E-boxes in the human CD47 promoter. TCGA and METABRIC datasets from breast cancer patients revealed that CD47 correlated with SNAI1 andVimentin. At functional level, different EMT-activated breast cancer cells wereless efficiently phagocytosed by macrophages vs. MCF7 cells. The phagocytosis of EMT-activated cells was rescued by using CD47 blocking antibody or by genetictargeting of SNAI1, ZEB1 or CD47. These results provide a rationale for aninnovative preclinical combination immunotherapy based on PD-1/PD-L1 and CD47blockade along with EMT inhibitors in patients with highly aggressive,mesenchymal, and metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1345415 PMCID: PMC5889210 [Available on 2019-02-15]PMID: 29632713
