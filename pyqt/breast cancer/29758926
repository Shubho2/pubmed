Pathological complete response (pCR) is commonly used as a valid predictor of NCT long-term outcomes. Blood-based tumor biomarkers have the potential to predict response to NCT at early stage non-invasively. We believedplasma CCL5 could be a potential marker to predict NCT of LABC. Its efficiencyand possible mechanism was studied in this work. Human Cytokine AntibodyMicroarray was applied to screen different cytokine concentration in plasmabetween low histological regression (Low-R) and high histological regression(High-R) patients. LABC patients were divided into two groups according topathological reactivity. The concentration of plasma CCL5 in different groups wasdetermined by ELISA analysis. CCK8 assay was performed to analyze epirubicinsusceptibility of breast cancer cells. Transwell assay was performed to determinethe effect of CCL5 on breast cancer cells' migration and invasion. qRT-PCR andwestern blot were used to verify the EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition)markers in CCL5-treated and epirubicin-treated breast cancer cells. Theconcentration of plasma CCL5 of Low-R group was higher than High-R group beforeNCT. The plasma levels of CCL5 were significantly reduced after NCT in the group of high histological regression (High-R). Epirubicin susceptibility decreased in the breast cancer cells treated by recombinant CCL5. Migration and invasion were significantly enhanced in breast cancer cells treated by recombinant CCL5.E-cadherin expression was decreased whereas vimentin increased significantly inCCL5-treated breast cancer cells. The phosphorylation of ezrin in Y-567 and itsdownstream protein cortactin increased significantly in CCL5-treated breastcancer cells. Plasma CCL5 level could be a promised candidate to predictchemotherapy response of breast cancer. Plasma CCL5 plays an important role inEMT process of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-170986 PMID: 29758926
