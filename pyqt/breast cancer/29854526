Because ofpotentially malignant findings on ultrasonography and during clinicalexamination, the patient underwent an excisional biopsy. Histologically, thelesion was composed of spindle to round shaped cells arranged in short bundles ina storiform pattern. Immunohistochemically, the cells were positive for vimentin and SMA and negative for desmin, S100, and CD34. Based on these morphological andimmunohistochemical features, a diagnosis of nodular fasciitis was made. Weemphasize that nodular fasciitis of the breast may show clinical features andimaging findings similar to those of breast cancer. The histopathologic diagnosisof nodular fasciitis can also be challenging. The purpose of this case report is to highlight the characteristics and the differential diagnosis of this rareneoplasm.DOI: 10.1155/2018/1612587 PMCID: PMC5952560PMID: 29854526
