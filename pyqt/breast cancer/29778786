The aim of thisstudy was to evaluate the association between body weight and breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a case-control study nested in a cohort of abreast cancer mammography screening program in Southern Brazil. A trainedinvestigator administered a standardized interview to collect sociodemographicand clinical data, and body weight history (weight at menarche, at marriage, atfirst and last pregnancy, and at menopause). Current anthropometric measurements were also made.RESULTS: Fifty-seven women with cancer (66.7% postmenopausal) and 159 controlswere included. Current age (60.3 ± 10.4 vs. 55.8 ± 8.4 years, P < .01), maritalstatus (49.1% vs. 64.8% with a partner, P = .03), and physical activity (48.2%vs. 32.3% sedentary, P = .01) were significantly different between cases andcontrols, respectively. Odds ratio showed that age and current waistcircumference were associated with postmenopausal cancer. No difference was foundin relation to body weight at different stages of life.CONCLUSION: Women with social vulnerability recruited at a mammography screening program in Southern Brazil showed a large weight gain during life, but nosignificant differences were found in body weight between women with or withoutbreast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
