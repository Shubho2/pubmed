Interventions involvedself-directed learning, one skin and one breast, that showed pathologists howtheir interpretations compared to a reference diagnoses. Prior to the educationalintervention, participants estimated how their interpretations would compare tothe reference diagnoses. After the intervention, participants estimated theiroverall agreement with the reference diagnoses. Perceived and actual agreementswere compared.RESULTS: For pathologists interpreting skin, mean actual agreement was 52.4% and overall pre- and postinterventional mean perceived agreement was 72.9% vs 54.2%, an overestimated mean difference of 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.2% to 24.0%) and 1.8% (95% CI -0.5% to 4.1%), respectively. For pathologistsinterpreting breast, mean actual agreement was 75.9% and overall pre- andpostinterventional mean perceived agreement was 81.4% vs 76.9%, an overestimationof 5.5% (95% CI 3.0% to 8.0%) and 1.0% (95% CI 0.0% to 2.0%), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Pathologists interpreting breast tissue had improved comprehensionof their performance after the intervention compared to pathologists interpretingskin lesions.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
