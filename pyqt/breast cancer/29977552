It is known that cell physiology isguided by bioelectrical properties, and there is a significant growth inhibition in cancerous (MDA-MB-231) cells that are grown in media that has beenreconstituted with the saline that has been exposed to the bio-field array directcurrent dielectrophoretic electromagnetic field, alternatively there is no growthinhibition noted in noncancerous cells (MCF-10A) when grown in the bio-fieldarray direct current dielectrophoretic electromagnetic field treated versuscontrol media.Methods: To examine the basis for selective growth inhibition in human breastcarcinoma, we employed cell death assays, cell cycle assays, microarray analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Results: We found a large transcriptional reprogramming in the cell lines and of the genes affected, those involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and theunfolded protein response pathways showed some of the most dramatic changes.Cancerous cells grown in media that has been reconstituted with a hypotonicsaline solution that has been exposed to the bio-field array direct currentdielectrophoretic electromagnetic field show a significant and strongupregulation of the apoptotic arms of the unfolded protein response while thenoncancerous cells show a decrease in endoplasmic reticulum stress via microarrayanalyses and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Conclusion: The bio-field array shows potential to initiate apoptosis incancerous cells while relieving cell stress in noncancerous cells in vitro. Thesestudies lay a foundation for nurses to conduct future in vivo models for thepossible development of future adjunct treatments in chronic disease.DOI: 10.1177/2050312118783412 PMCID: PMC6024343PMID: 29977552
