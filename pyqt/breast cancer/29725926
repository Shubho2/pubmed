This test set was independentlyassessed by a senior screening radiologist and by a radiology resident withoutprior training in screening mammography at 1.5 m distance from the screendisplay. Readers were unaware of the prevalence of pathologically provenmalignant tumours in the test set. Primary outcome was whether the reader wouldrecall the woman.RESULTS: The senior screening radiologist recalled 28 of 28 women with apathologically proven malignant tumour (sensitivity of 100%) and 16 of 56 womenwithout pathology (specificity of 71%). The radiology resident recalled 25 of 28 women with a pathologically proven malignant tumour (sensitivity of 89%) and 10of 56 women without pathology (specificity of 82%).CONCLUSION: Some malignant tumours missed by an individual screening radiologist can be detected from 1.5 m distance. Therefore, we recommend that screeningradiologists consciously take a distant view before closely evaluating themammogram in detail.DOI: 10.1007/s11845-018-1828-8 PMID: 29725926
