This study was intended to developcyclodextrin/chitosan nanoparticles (ccNPs) for oral delivery of RXF in order to enhance the oral bioavailability. RXF-loaded ccNPs (RXF-ccNPs) were prepared bycyclodextrin inclusion followed by complexation with chitosan. RXF-ccNPs werefully characterized by particle size, morphology and in vitro drug release. Theoral delivery efficacy and transepithelial transport potential were evaluated by pharmacokinetics, in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion, cellular uptake andex vivo imaging. The resulting RXF-ccNPs were around 165 nm in particle size witha narrow distribution. The oral bioavailability of RXF was enhanced by 2.6 folds through ccNPs compared to RXF suspensions in rats. It was shown that RXF-ccNPscould improve the intestinal permeability of RXF, increase the cellular uptake ofRXF and facilitate its transport across the absorptive epithelia. The resultsindicate that our developed ccNPs based on sulfobutylether-&beta;-cyclodextrinand oligochitosan are a promising vehicle to orally deliver poorly water-soluble drugs over and above RXF.DOI: 10.3390/pharmaceutics10030076 PMID: 29958389
