The median time to progression was 4 months for the overall studypopulation; it was significantly longer for patients with non-visceral metastasis(5.4 months; 95% confidence interval=3.7-11.2 months) than for those withvisceral metastasis (3.3 months; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-5.3 months;p=0.01). No differences in time to progression were found between the groups ofpatients with visceral metastasis and non-visceral metastasis who underwent otherendocrine therapies.CONCLUSION: Fulvestrant is more effective for patients with non-visceralmetastasis of recurrent breast cancer with than for those with visceralmetastasis.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12387 PMID: 29491088  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
