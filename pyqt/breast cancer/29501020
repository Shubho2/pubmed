The association of LCIS with totalmetastatic lobular breast cancer is very rare.PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a case of a totally metastatic lobular breastcancer in an asymptomatic 64-year-old postmenopausal woman, with no suspiciousmicrocalcifications in mammography. A total hysterectomy with bilateralsalpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy, infracolic omentectomy andappendectomy was performed along with a quadrantectomy of the upper outerquadrant of left breast, and systematic isolateral lymphadenectomy of the leftaxilla.DISCUSSION: LCIS is usually undetectable because it isn't associated withclinical abnormalities in clinical examination and is presented in mammography asmicrocalcifications or focal asymmetric densities. ILC histopathologic featuresare responsible for the high false-negative rates on mammography, leading tomoderate detection sensitivity.CONCLUSION: Our case is a very rare condition. No 'similar' case have beendescribed in the literature so far.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..
