Therefore, the survival time of MCF-7 breast cancer bearing micesignificantly increases.CONCLUSION: The synergetic therapy of cryoablation and DOX nanoparticles is aneffective therapy means for breast cancer. This strategy provides new means fortreating breast cancer.DOI: 10.2217/nnm-2018-0168 PMID: 30071777
