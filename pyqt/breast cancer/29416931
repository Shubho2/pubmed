Because the toxicological data for the combination of these drugs is limited, we investigated the toxicity of the crizotinib and palbociclib combination in 80 ICR (CD-1) mice (average age = ~20 weeks). Treatments were arranged as a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial and included sex (female vs. male), crizotinib (0 or 4 mg), and palbociclib (0 or 1 mg). Drugswere administered to mice by oral gavage 24 hours (n = 40) and 7 days (n = 40)prior to the collection of blood and tissue samples to determine serum chemistry,hematology, and histopathology. After dosing, each study group of mice wasobserved acutely (24 hrs) and subacutely (7 days) for any clinical changesassociated with toxicity from the drugs. Serum chemistry, hematological effects, and selected histological tissue samples of each animal immediately aftereuthanasia were analyzed at the end of the study. No significant abnormalities orchanges in the clinical signs, body and organ weight, or gross andhistopathological evaluations were observed. Although within the normal referencerange, there was an elevation in the red blood cells (P = 0.05) from 24-hourcrizotinib- and palbociclib-treated mice (both males and females), whichcontrasted with the typical anemia observed in palbociclib-treated patients.Administration of the crizotinib and palbociclib combination resulted in anelevation in the ALT liver enzyme (P = 0.05) in the 24-hour treated group (bothmale and female), but the levels were within the normal ranges of the mice.Overall, serum chemistry and hematology did not reach significant abnormal levelsin any of the acute- or subacute-treated groups. The results of this studyconfirmed that the combination of crizotinib and palbociclib at the given dosesdid not cause significant treatment-related toxicities in mice.PMCID: PMC5794732PMID: 29416931
