PS findings were categorized as: Category A:non-visualization of SLN; Category B: unusual uptake location; Category C:equivocal uptake / difficult interpretation. The K-coefficient of Cohen was used to evaluate the correlation between PS and SPECT/CT results. PS and SPECT/CTimages were interpreted separately, and SLN identification on each of themodalities was correlated to BMI (Body mass index) and peroperative radio guided results.Results: Between April 2015 and January 2017, 1028 early breast cancer casesunderwent sentinel lymphoscintigraphy. Of total, 134 (13%) patients underwentSPECT/CT in addition to PS. All were females with mean age of 48.15 years (range:26-82 years). Right sided in 68, left in 64 and 2 with bilateral carcinoma. ByTNM classification: 49 (37%) T1, 78 (58%) T2 and 7 (5%) had DCIS/Paget'sdisease.Overall SLNs were detected on both PS and SPECT/CT in 60% cases. Ofcategory A (n=54); 35/54 (64%) SLN localized on SPECT/CT; 32 were level-I; 2Level-II; 1 Level-III nodes. In 19, SLN was not localized. Of category B (n=18), 5 had prior lumpectomy, SPECT/CT localized tracer uptake to 17 level-I sentinelnodes, 3 level-II and level III / IMC in 9. Of category C (n=62), 29 had priorlumpectomy. SPECT/CT confirmed SLN in all the cases. Radio-guided surgeryconfirmed SPECT/CT results. The correlation between the two techniques was low(K=0.34). Where PS was negative; SPECT/CT localized nodes in statisticallysignificant number of cases (=0.01). PS identified SLN uptakes in 80/134 (60%)cases with a mean BMI of 21.6±4.8 kg/m2 while SPECT/CT detected ''hot'' nodes in 115/134 (86%) cases with a mean BMI of 29.6±5.6 kg/m2. For overweight/obesepatients (n=59) (BMI>25 kg/m2), PS failed to identify SLNs in 49 and SPECT/CTfailed to do so in 18 (<0.001).Conclusion: SPECT/CT has diagnostic yield and helps in precise SLN localizationwhere planar imaging is negative or shows unusual site of uptake.DOI: 10.22038/aojnmb.2018.10720 PMCID: PMC6038979PMID: 29998140
