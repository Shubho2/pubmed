Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine thebenefits at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of a 3-month exercise and education programamong women after breast cancer treatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred nine outpatients treated for primary breastcarcinoma were divided into a control group (n = 106) and an experimental group(n = 103) which underwent a 3-month rehabilitation program including physicaltraining and psychoeducational sessions. The assessments, performed before theprogram and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after inclusion, included validatedquestionnaires on quality of life and symptoms.RESULTS: The analyses revealed an improvement in quality of life and symptomsafter the exercise and education program within the experimental group and amaintenance of these improvements during the 2 years of follow-up. Theseimprovements were significantly better than those in the control group, clearlydemonstrating that the program has benefits.CONCLUSION: This trial identified the benefits of a well-detailed 3-monthexercise and education program over 24 months' follow-up among women after breastcancer treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
