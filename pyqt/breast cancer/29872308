However, little is known about the expression and function of MET in sarcomas, including OS. Thisstudy investigated the expression and clinicopathological significance of Ovol2and its effect on MET in OS.Patients and methods: The Ovol2 expression in the tumor samples from patientswith OS was examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). We then upregulated theOvol2 expression in MG-63 and SW1353 cells, detected the expression ofMET-associated proteins, and observed the effects of Ovol2 on OS cellproliferation, migration, and cytoskeleton reorganization using Cell CountingKit-8, transwell invasion, and phalloidin dyeing assays, respectively. Thecorrelation between zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and Ovol2 wasassessed using the luciferase gene reporter assay in the MG-63 and SW1353 cellsand IHC in the human OS tissue samples.Results: The Ovol2 protein overexpression was related to the clinical grade(P=0.02) and the recurrence and metastasis (P=0.02) of OS. Results of the invitro experiments showed that Ovol2 overexpression can suppress cell migrationand invasion and can regulate the expression levels of MET-associated proteins.Ovol2 suppresses ZEB1 expression by binding to the ZEB1 promoter. Ovol2 isconcomitant with a reduced IHC expression of ZEB1 in human OS tissues.Conclusion: Ovol2 expression is associated with MET in OS cells and suppressesZEB1 expression and OS progression.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S157119 PMCID: PMC5973319PMID: 29872308
