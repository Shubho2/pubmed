Thus, novel biomarkers that personalize the therapeutic regimen andevaluate prognosis for TNBC patients should be determined.METHODS: We analyzed the cystatin E/M (CST6) expression profiles of 161 TNBCtissues and 14 noncancerous tissues through multiple statistical analyses. Wealso investigated the relationship of CST6 expression with clinical parametersand evaluated the prognostic value of CST6 in 161 TNBC patients.RESULTS: CST6, a member of the cystatin superfamily, was remarkably moreup-regulated in TNBC tissues than in adjacent normal breast tissues. High CST6expression was frequently observed in white people and associated with a highrisk of lymph-node metastasis. Cox regression analysis confirmed that the highCST6 expression was an independent predictor of disease-free survival in TNBC.Kaplan-Meier analysis further revealed that high CST6 expression caused a lowdisease-free survival rate.CONCLUSION: CST6 is involved in the progression of TNBC and may act as atumor-promoter gene. A systematic literature review shows that our study is thefirst to explore the relationship between CST6 and TNBC.Â© 2018 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.PMID: 29530995
