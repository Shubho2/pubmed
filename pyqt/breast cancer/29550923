A study aiming at the discovery ofradiation markers of the breast cancer was conducted from 2008 to 2015 within acollaborative project by HZM, LMU, and NRCRM. In this study, post-Chernobylbreast cancer cases both in radiation-exposed female patients diagnosed at ageless than 60 from 1992 to 2014 and in non-exposed controls matched for residency,tumor type, age at diagnosis, TNM classification as well as tumor grading wereinvestigated for molecular changes with special emphasis to copy numberalterations and miRNA profiles. Cancer registry and clinical archive data wereused to identify 435 breast cancer patients among female clean-up workers and 14 among evacuees from highly contaminated territories as candidates for the study. Of these, 129 breast cancer patients fit study inclusion criteria and were tracedfor individual reconstruction of the target organ (breast) doses. The doses were estimated for 71 exposed cases (clean-up workers and evacuees from whichbiomaterial was available for molecular studies and who agreed to participate in a dosimetric interview) by the use of the well-established RADRUE method, whichwas adjusted specifically for the assessment of breast doses. The results of 58female clean-up workers showed a large inter-individual variability of doses in arange of about five orders of magnitude: from 0.03 to 929 mGy, with median of5.8 mGy. The study provides the first quantitative estimate of exposures receivedby female clean-up workers, which represent a limited but very important group ofpopulation affected by the Chernobyl accident. The doses of 13 women evacuatedafter the accident who did not take part in the clean-up activities (from 4 to45 mGy with median of 19 mGy) are in line with the previous estimates for theevacuees from Pripyat and the 30-km zone.DOI: 10.1007/s00411-018-0738-5 PMID: 29550923  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
