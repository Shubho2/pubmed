The Kaplan-Meier model for univariate andCox-regression model with backward stepwise factor retention method formultivariate analyses were used. Chi square test was used to find out theassociations with the established prognostic features.RESULTS: A total of 1124 patients were included in the study and KIBRA stainingof 909 breast cancers were available for analysis. Cytoplasmic KIBRA expressionwas seen in 39.5% and nuclear expression in 44.8%. Overall KIBRA-low breastcancers accounted for 41.5%. KIBRA nuclear expression was significantlyassociated with positive ER and PR expression. Luminal breast cancer patients whohad endocrine therapy and KIBRA-low expression had a RFS disadvantage over those who were positive for KIBRA (p = 0.02). Similarly, patients who receivedchemotherapy and had overall KIBRA-low expression also demonstrated a RFSdisadvantage compared to those who had overall positive KIBRA expression(p = 0.018). This effect of KIBRA was independent of the other factors consideredfor the model.CONCLUSION: Overall low-KIBRA expression has an independent effect on the RFS andpredicts the RFS outcome of luminal breast cancer patients who received endocrinetherapy and breast cancer patients who received chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4491-6 PMCID: PMC5968668PMID: 29793439
