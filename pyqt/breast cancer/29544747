Thepresent meta-analysis was designed to investigate its prognostic value ofpretreatment LMR in pancreatic cancer (PC).METHODS: An integrated meta-analysis was conducted and eligible studies wererecruited by a systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. The association between LMR and survival outcomes and clinicopathological featureswere analyzed in PC patients.RESULTS: A total of 10 studies (11 cohorts) comprising 2557 patients wereincluded in this meta-analysis. The result demonstrated that low LMR couldpredict unfavorable overall survival(OS) (HR: 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.50-0.71, p < 0.001) and disease-free survival (DFS)/recurrence-free survival(RFS) (HR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.20-0.94, p = 0.03). Moreover, low LMR was alsopositively correlated with male patients, CA199, and TNM stage.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that low pretreatment LMR was associated withadvanced clinicopathological features and poor prognosis as a predicative factor in patients with PC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
