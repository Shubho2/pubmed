Women who develop an invasive breastcancer after DCIS have a much greater risk of dying than those who do not and it is often stated that these deaths are a consequence of metastases from theinvasive in-breast recurrence. This progression is the result of a two-stepprocess: first local invasive recurrence and then spread beyond the breast. Alarge proportion of women who die of DCIS have no record of invasive recurrence. We used SEER data and a simulation approach to test whether the actual mortality data are consistent with the two-step model.METHODS: First, we constructed Kaplan-Meier mortality curves for all patientswith pure DCIS and with small node-negative invasive breast cancers in theSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries database(1998-2014). We then constructed, through simulation, theoretical breast cancermortality curves. To model the two-step scenario, we applied the annual incidencerates of incident invasive cancer following DCIS and of death from invasivecancer after DCIS to a theoretical cohort of 100,000 women.RESULTS: The observed 15-year breast cancer-specific mortality rate for patients with pure DCIS in the SEER database was 2.0%. The expected mortality for DCISpatients (assuming a two-step process) was only 1.1% at 15 years. Assuming themortality rates following DCIS were one-half of those observed for patients with small invasive breast cancers, the expected mortality at 15 years post-DCIS was2.1%.CONCLUSIONS: In the SEER database, we observed far more deaths from DCIS thanwould be expected under a model where all deaths from breast cancer occur amongstwomen who experience an invasive local recurrence. This lends support to thehypothesis that DCIS mortality is not restricted to those women who experience anin-breast invasive cancer and that DCIS has properties similar to small invasive breast cancers.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4716-z PMID: 29445939
