However, a consistent and reliable methodresulting in the most ideal aesthetic results has yet to be clarified. This studyanalysed the long-term outcomes of nipple reconstruction using Rapiplug.METHODS: Forty-one patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction aftermastectomy between January 2014 and February 2017 were enrolled. Nipplereconstruction was performed with C-V flap and Hammond flap, and hat-shapedRapiplug was implanted at the flap core. Nipple projection and width weremeasured and nipple reduction rates were calculated immediately after and at 3,6, and 12 months after surgery. Patient satisfaction was surveyed at the 12-monthfollow-up and compared with patient characteristics and other variables.RESULTS: Forty-one nipple reconstructions were performed in 41 patients. Mostpost-operative adverse events were resolved with conservative management, andrevision was performed in only one case. The mean nipple projections were 8.9 ±1.8, 7 ± 1.8, 5.6 ± 1.6 and 4.9 ± 1.6 mm immediately, and 3, 6 and 12 monthsafter surgery, respectively, and the mean reduction rate of nipple size withreference to the size immediately after surgery was 22.2%, 37.2% and 44.7% at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, respectively. Patient satisfaction was 82.9% inoverall outcome, and 85.3% of projection was good or excellent.CONCLUSION: Rapiplug can improve the long-term preservation of nipple projection after nipple reconstruction and is considered to be consistent and reliable with good aesthetic outcomes and no severe complications.© 2018 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.DOI: 10.1111/ans.14410 PMID: 29423974
