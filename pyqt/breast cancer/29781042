However, since the implementation of the program in 2011, enrolment rates have been lower than anticipated. Whilst there may be severalreasons for this to happen, it does call into consideration the 'inverse equitylaw', whereby the more advantaged in society are the first to participate andbenefit from universal health services. An outcome of this phenomenon is anincrease in the health divide between those that are at a social advantage versusthose that are not. Using an intersectionality lens, this paper explores the roleof the social determinants of health and social identity in creating possiblebarriers in the access to genetic screening for hereditary breast cancer, and theimplications for public health practice in recognising and ameliorating thesedifferences.DOI: 10.1007/s12687-018-0370-8 PMID: 29781042
