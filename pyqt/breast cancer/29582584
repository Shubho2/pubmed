In aclinical experiment, we tested the hypothesis that pathways regulating skeletalmuscle fatigue are down-regulated in skeletal muscle of breast cancer patientsand that different muscle gene expression patterns exist between breast tumoursubtypes. In a preclinical study, we tested the hypothesis that mammary tumourgrowth in mice induces skeletal muscle fatigue and that overexpression of thecytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) can attenuate mammary tumour-induced musclefatigue.METHODS: Early stage non-metastatic female breast cancer patients (n = 14) andfemale non-cancer patients (n = 6) provided a muscle biopsy of the pectoralismajor muscle during mastectomy, lumpectomy, or breast reconstruction surgeries.The breast cancer patients were diagnosed with either luminal (ER+ /PR+ , n = 6),triple positive (ER+ /PR+ /Her2/neu+ , n = 5), or triple negative (ER- /PR-/Her2/neu- , n = 3) breast tumours and were being treated with curative intenteither with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery or surgery followed bystandard post-operative therapy. Biopsies were used for RNA-sequencing to comparethe skeletal muscle gene expression patterns between breast cancer patients andnon-cancer patients. The C57BL/6 mouse syngeneic mammary tumour cell line, E0771,was used to induce mammary tumours in immunocompetent mice, and isometric muscle contractile properties and fatigue properties were analysed following 4 weeks of tumour growth.RESULTS: RNA-sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analyses revealed adysregulation of canonical pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation,mitochondrial dysfunction, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signalling and activation, and IL-15 signalling and production. In a preclinical mouse modelof breast cancer, the rate of muscle fatigue was greater in mice exposed tomammary tumour growth for 4 weeks, and this greater muscle fatigue was attenuatedin transgenic mice that overexpressed the cytokine IL-15.CONCLUSIONS: Our data identify novel genes and pathways dysregulated in themuscles of breast cancer patients with early stage non-metastatic disease, withparticularly aberrant expression among genes that would predispose these patientsto greater muscle fatigue. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IL-15 overexpression can attenuate muscle fatigue associated with mammary tumour growth in apreclinical mouse model of breast cancer. Therefore, we propose that skeletalmuscle fatigue is an inherent consequence of breast tumour growth, and thisgreater fatigue can be targeted therapeutically.© 2018 The Authors.
