Methods For 456women who received breast cancer radiotherapy between 1958 and 2001 and thenlater experienced a major coronary event, information was obtained on theradiotherapy regimen they received and on the location of their cardiac injury.For 414 women, all with documented location of left ventricular (LV) injury,doses to five LV segments were estimated. For 133 women, all with documentedlocation of coronary artery disease with ≥ 70% stenosis, doses to six coronaryartery segments were estimated. For each segment, numbers of women withleft-sided and right-sided breast cancer were compared. Results Of women with LV injury, 243 had left-sided breast cancer and 171 had right-sided breast cancer(ratio of left v right, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.73), reflecting the highertypical LV radiation doses in left-sided cancer (average dose left-sided, 8.3 Gy;average dose right-sided, 0.6 Gy; left minus right dose difference, 7.7 Gy). For individual LV segments, the ratios of women with left- versus right-sidedradiotherapy were as follows: inferior, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.25); lateral,1.42 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.95); septal, 2.09 (95% CI, 1.37 to 3.19); anterior, 1.85 (95% CI, 1.39 to 2.46); and apex, 4.64 (95% CI, 2.42 to 8.90); correspondingleft-minus-right dose differences for these segments were 2.7, 4.9, 7.2, 10.4,and 21.6 Gy, respectively ( Ptrend < .001). For women with coronary arterydisease, the ratios of women with left- versus right-radiotherapy for individual coronary artery segments were as follows: right coronary artery proximal, 0.48(95% CI, 0.26 to 0.91); right coronary artery mid or distal, 1.69 (95% CI, 0.85to 3.36); circumflex proximal, 1.46 (95% CI, 0.72 to 2.96); circumflex distal,1.11 (95% CI, 0.45 to 2.73); left anterior descending proximal, 1.89 (95% CI,1.07 to 3.34); and left anterior descending mid or distal, 2.33 (95% CI, 1.19 to 4.59); corresponding left-minus-right dose differences for these segements were-5.0, -2.5, 1.6, 3.5, 9.5, and 38.8 Gy ( Ptrend = .002). Conclusion Forindividual LV and coronary artery segments, higher radiation doses were strongly associated with more frequent injury, suggesting that all segments are sensitive to radiation and that doses to all segments should be minimized.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.77.6351 PMID: 29791285
