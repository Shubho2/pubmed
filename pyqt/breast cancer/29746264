Studies show that high adherence to such guidelines is associated with a decreasein overall cancer incidence and mortality. However, there are sparse data onadherence to the ACS guidelines in cancer survivors.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe adherence to the ACS guidelines in female cancer survivors who participated in an exercise intervention trial for1 year.METHODS: Perimenopausal and early postmenopausal female cancer survivors (n =154) participated in a randomized controlled trial that examined the efficacy of an aerobic-resistance exercise intervention. In addition to body mass index andalcohol, diet and physical activity data were collected with 4-day diet recordsand the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. A scoring system was used to determine adherence to the ACS guidelines, with scores ranging from 0 (noadherence) to 8 (highest adherence).RESULTS: Mean total adherence scores for ACS guidelines for all intervention and control condition participants, most of whom had breast or gynecological cancers,were 4.2 (baseline), 4.9 (6 months), and 4.8 (12 months), suggesting moderateadherence. Physical activity levels improved in both groups; however, nosignificant change was observed for adherence to weight, dietary, or alcoholintake guidelines for either group.CONCLUSION: Findings indicate only partial adherence to the ACS guidelines, even for motivated cancer survivors participating in an exercise intervention study.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Further research is needed regarding strategies andinterventions to improve adherence to ACS guidelines.DOI: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000602 PMID: 29746264
