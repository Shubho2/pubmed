However, its clinicapplication is limited by its instability and poor solubility. In the presentwok, curcumin was loaded into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), in order toimprove the therapeutic efficacy for breast cancer. The results measured usingtransmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that Cur-SLNs have awell-defined spherical shape; the size was about 40 nm with a negative surfacecharge. The drug loading and encapsulation efficiency in SLNs reached 23.38% and 72.47%, respectively. The Cur-SLNs showed a stronger cytotoxicity against SKBR3cells. In vitro cellular uptake study demonstrated a high uptake efficiency ofthe Cur-SLNs by SKBR3 cells. Moreover, Cur-SLNs induced higher apoptosis in SKBR3cells, compared to cells treated by free drug. In addition, Western blot analysisrevealed that Cur-SLNs could promote the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, but decreased theexpression of cyclin D1 and CDK4. These results suggested that Cur-SLNs could be a potential useful chemotherapeutic formulation for breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23071578 PMID: 29966245
