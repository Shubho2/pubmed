Survivorship stage maymoderate a direct effect of stress on psychosocial adjustment. This study aimedto examine relationships between stress, social support, self-efficacy, coping,and psychosocial adjustment to construct a model of the effect pathways betweenthose factors, and determine if survivorship stage moderates those effects.METHODS: Six hundred people with breast cancer completed questionnaires. Examinedstages of survivorship after treatment were as follows: acute (i.e., <2 years),extended (2-5 years), and lasting (>5 years). Stress (Perceived Stress Scale),social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support),self-efficacy (New General Self Efficacy Scale), coping (Ways of CopingChecklist), and psychosocial adjustment (Psychosocial Adjustment to IllnessScale-Self-Report-Korean Version) were measured.RESULTS: Self-efficacy significantly correlated with psychosocial adjustment inthe acute survival stage (γ = -0.37, P < .001). Stress inversely correlated with coping only in the extended survival stage (γ = -0.56, P < .001). Socialsupport's benefit to psychosocial adjustment was greater in the acute (γ = -0.42,P < .001) and extended survival stages (γ = -0.56, P < .001) than in the lasting survival stage. Stress's negative correlation with psychosocial adjustment wasstronger in the lasting survival stage (β = 0.42, P < .001) than in the acutesurvival stage.CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, it is necessary to improve self-efficacy,social support, and manage stress according to survival stage for psychosocialadjustment of female breast cancer patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
