The aim of this study was to determine predictivefactors for metastasis to sentinel node (SN) in primary invasive breast cancer.METHOD: This is a study of 3979 patients with primary breast cancer during2008-2013 in Malmö and Lund scheduled for surgery and included in the informationretrieved from Information Network for Cancer Care (INCA). The final studypopulation included 2552 patients with primary invasive breast cancer. The riskof metastases to SN were examined in relation to potential clinicopathologicalfactors such as age, screening mammography, tumor size, tumor type, histological grade, estrogen status, progesterone status, Her-2 status, multifocality, andlymphovascular invasion. Binary logistic regression was used; adjusted analysesyielded odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval.RESULTS: Tumors detected by mammography screening were less likely to beassociated with metastases to SN compared to those not found by mammographyscreening (0.63; 0.51-0.80). Negative hormonal status for estrogen associatedwith lower risk for SN metastases compared to tumor with positive estrogen status(0.64; 0.42-0.99). Tumors with a size more than 20 mm had higher risk tometastasize to SN (1.84; 1.47-2.33) compared to tumors less than 20 mm.Multifocality (1.90; 1.45-2.47) and lymphovascular invasion (3.74; 2.66-5.27)were also strong predictive factors for SN metastases.CONCLUSION: SN metastasis is less likely to occur in women with invasive breastcancer diagnosed by screening mammogram. Tumors with negative estrogen status areassociated with low risk for SN metastases. Tumors larger than 20 mm,multifocality, or lymphovascular invasion are also factors associated with highrisk for SN metastases.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1353-2 PMCID: PMC5848524PMID: 29530065
