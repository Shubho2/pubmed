The expression of cIAP2 in tissues is typically low and considered functionally redundant with cIAP1, however cIAP2 can be activated by a variety of cellular stresses. Members of the TNFR family and their ligandshave essential roles in mammary gland biology. We have found that cIAP2-/- virginmammary glands have reduced ductal branching and delayed lobuloalveogenesis inearly pregnancy. Post-lactational involution involves two phases where the first phase is reversible and is mediated, in part, by TNFR family ligands. In cIAP2-/-mice mammary glands appeared engorged at mid-lactation accompanied by enhancedautophagic flux and decreased cIAP1 protein expression. Severely stretchedmyoepithelium was associated with BIM-EL expression and other indicators ofanoikis. Within 24 h after forced or natural weaning, cIAP2 -/- glands had nearlycompleted involution. The TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (Tweak) whichresults in degradation of cIAP1 through its receptor, Fn14, began to increase in late lactation and was significantly increased in cIAP2 -/- relative to WT miceby 12 h post weaning accompanied by decreased cIAP1 protein expression.Carcinogen/progesterone-induced mammary tumorigenesis was significantly delayedin cIAP2-/- mice and tumors contained high numbers of apoptotic cells. Weconclude that cIAP2 has a critical role in the mammary gland wherein it prevents rapid involution induced by milk stasis-induced stress associated with Tweakactivation and contributes to the survival of mammary tumor cells.DOI: 10.1007/s10911-018-9398-y PMID: 29876871
