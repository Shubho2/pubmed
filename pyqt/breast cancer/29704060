This study aimed to assess patients'satisfaction with a standardized treatment service on integrative medicine.METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, 75 breast cancer patients from theintegrative medicine consultancy service at the University Breast Center forFranconia were evaluated between January 2016 and March 2017. At primaryconsultation, patients answered a standardized questionnaire on their medicalhistory and treatment goals regarding integrative medicine. In a subsequentinterview, patients evaluated their satisfaction with the treatment service andindividual treatment goals.RESULTS: 72% of the patients (n = 54) reported high satisfaction with the overallapproach of the treatment service. 76% of the patients (n = 57) were verysatisfied or satisfied with their individual treatment plans. The most frequentlyreported goals were to slow tumor progression (n = 64, 85.3%), reducing the side effects of conventional cancer treatments (n = 60, 80%), and a desire toparticipate actively in the treatment of breast cancer (n = 64, 85.3%).CONCLUSIONS: Using a standardized procedure in integrative medicine allows a highquality level to be offered to patients. Overall, breast cancer patients reportvery high satisfaction with the integrative medicine consultancy service andstate long-term treatment goals. Hence, long-term treatment with integrativemedicine methods should be taken into consideration.DOI: 10.1007/s00404-018-4779-4 PMID: 29704060
