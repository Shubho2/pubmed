Electronic address: esmaeili.rezvan@gmail.com.The important challenge about cancer is diagnosis in primary stages and propertreatment. Although classical clinico-pathological features of the tumor havemajor prognostic value, the advances in diagnosis and treatment are indebted todiscovery of molecular biomarkers and control of cancer in the pre-invasivestate. Moreover, the efficiency of available therapeutic options is highlydiminished, and chemotherapy is still the main treatment due to lack of enoughspecific targets. Accordingly, finding the new noninvasive biomarkers for cancer is still an important clinical challenge that is not achieved yet. There arecurrent technologies to screen, diagnose, prognose, and treat cancer, but thelimitations of these implements and procedures are undeniable. Liquid biopsy as anoninvasive method has a promising future in the field of cancer, and exosomes asone of the recent areas have drawn much attention. In this review, the potential capability of exosomes is summarized in cancer with the special focus on breastcancer as the second cause of cancer mortality in women all around the world. It discusses reasons to choose exosomes for liquid biopsy and the studies related todifferent potential biomarkers found in the exosomes. Moreover, exosome studieson milk as a specific biofluid are also discussed. At last, because choosing the method for exosome studies is very challenging, a summary of different techniquesis provided.Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
