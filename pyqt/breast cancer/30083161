In this study, weconstructed IL-6-knockdown breast cancer mice models to explore the molecularevents involved in the IL-6-mediated effects on MDSC development. We defined asubset of early-stage MDSCs (e-MDSCs) with the phenotype ofCD11b+Gr-1-F4/80-MHCII- in IL-6 high-expressing 4T1 mice mammary carcinomamodels, which were the precursors of CD11b+Gr-1+ conventional MDSCs. Furthermore,sustained suppression of SOCS3 and aberrant hyperactivation of the JAK/STATsignaling pathway was exclusively detected in wide-type 4T1 tumor-bearing mice,which promoted the accumulation of e-MDSCs in situ and their immunosuppressivecapability in vitro. After blocking the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway with theIL-6 receptor antibody or STAT3 antagonist JSI-124 in tumor-bearing mice,significant shrinkage of primary tumors and decrease in lung metastatic noduleswere observed in vivo, accompanied by the dramatic decrease of e-MDSC recruitmentand recovery of anti-tumor T cell immunity. Thus, SOCS3 suppression acceleratedthe IL-6-mediated growth and metastasis of mammary carcinoma via affectingmyeloid differentiation in breast cancer. Moreover, the IL-6/STAT3 signalingpathway might be a promising candidate target in developing novel therapeuticstrategies to eliminate e-MDSCs and improve breast cancer prognosis.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01699 PMCID: PMC6064721PMID: 30083161
