However, there is recent interest in intraoperative radiation therapy(IORT) to minimize toxicity while still improving local control beyond surgicalresection and anti-estrogen therapy alone.Materials and methods: All patients were evaluated pre-operatively in amultidisciplinary clinic setting at a community hospital for suitability forbreast conservation therapy. A total of 109 patients were reviewed receiving 110 IORT treatments. Patients were followed with clinical breast examinations andmammography as clinically indicated.Results: At a median follow-up of 29.9 months, 2/110 (1.8%) patients experienced a local failure. One patient (0.9%) experienced a regional failure. Localcontrol, disease-free survival and overall survival at 3 years were 98.9% (95%CI 92.2-99.8), 97.2% (95%CI 88.9-99.3), and 96.0% (95%CI 84.9-99.0), respectively.Five-year local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were96.3% (95%CI 84.7-99.2), 94.6% (95%CI 83.2-98.3), and 92.5% (95%CI 80.4-97.3),respectively. Patient self-reported cosmetic outcome was available for 51patients, with all patients reporting being either very pleased, pleased, orsatisfied with their cosmetic outcome, and no patients reported beingdissatisfied or worse.Conclusions: The results of our series suggest the feasibility of utilizing IORT in a community-based cancer center with a high degree of local control, andpatient satisfaction with regard to cosmesis. While the results of this seriessuggest that IORT may be a promising modality, longer follow-up is warranted tobetter understand exactly which clinicopathological features can predictlong-term locoregional disease control.DOI: 10.1007/s13566-017-0338-z PMCID: PMC5978806PMID: 29937985
