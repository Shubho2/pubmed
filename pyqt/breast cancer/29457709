Hybrid D-A polymer particles (H-DAPPs) passively localized withinorthotopic breast tumors, serving as bright fluorescent beacons. Laserstimulation induced heat generation on par with gold nanorods, resulting inselective destruction of the tumor. H-DAPPs can also undergo multiple thermaltreatments, with no loss of fluorescence intensity or photothermal potential.These results indicate that H-DAPPs provide new avenues for the synthesis ofhybrid nanoparticles useful in localized detection and treatment of disease.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b19503 PMID: 29457709
