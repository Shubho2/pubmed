We aimed to develop a model for absolute breastcancer risk prediction for Nigerian women.Methods: A total of 1,811 breast cancercases and 2,225 controls from the Nigerian Breast Cancer Study (NBCS, 1998-2015) were included. Subjects were randomly divided into the training and validationsets. Incorporating local incidence rates, multivariable logistic regressionswere used to develop the model.Results: The NBCS model included age, age atmenarche, parity, duration of breastfeeding, family history of breast cancer,height, body mass index, benign breast diseases, and alcohol consumption. Themodel developed in the training set performed well in the validation set. Thediscriminating accuracy of the NBCS model [area under ROC curve (AUC) = 0.703,95% confidence interval (CI), 0.687-0.719] was better than the Black Women'sHealth Study (BWHS) model (AUC = 0.605; 95% CI, 0.586-0.624), Gail model forwhite population (AUC = 0.551; 95% CI, 0.531-0.571), and Gail model for blackpopulation (AUC = 0.545; 95% CI, 0.525-0.565). Compared with the BWHS and twoGail models, the net reclassification improvement of the NBCS model were 8.26%,13.45%, and 14.19%, respectively.Conclusions: We have developed a breast cancerrisk prediction model specific to women in Nigeria, which provides a promisingand indispensable tool to identify women in need of breast cancer early detectionin Sub-Saharan Africa populations.Impact: Our model is the first breast cancerrisk prediction model in Africa. It can be used to identify women at high riskfor breast cancer screening.
