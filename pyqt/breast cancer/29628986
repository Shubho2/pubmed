We also sought to determine factors that may influence outcomes andchanges in the duration of survival over time.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a total of 10,988 patients with breastcancer who were treated at our institution between January 1993 and December2008. We divided the study period into three periods (P1, 1993-1997; P2,1998-2002; and P3, 2003-2008). We retrospectively reviewed the collected datafrom the Asan database, including age at diagnosis, clinical manifestations,pathology report, surgical methods, types of adjuvant treatment modalities, type of recurrence, and follow-up period.Results: At a median follow-up of 8.2 years, we observed that survival outcomeshave improved recently. The 5-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) ratealso increased from 82.8% in P1 to 92.6% in P3 (p<0.001). The survival rate inpatients with tumors at each stage increased in similar patterns in all patients,and, remarkably, there was a significant survival improvement in patients withstage III breast cancer (P1 vs. P3: 5-year BCSS, 57.4% vs. 80.0%, p<0.001). Thetime period was a significant prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P1 vs. P2: hazard ratio [HR], 0.83, p=0.035; P1 vs. P3: HR, 0.75, p=0.015).Conclusion: The study results suggest an improvement in breast cancer survival inKorea, which is consistent with the development of treatments and earlydetection.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.1.70 PMCID: PMC5880968PMID: 29628986
