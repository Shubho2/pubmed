Electronic address: eslee@yu.ac.kr.As part of our effort to develop potential topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) targetinganticancer agents, we systematically designed a new series of hydroxy andchloro-substituted 2,4-diphenyl 5H-chromeno[4,3-b]pyridines. Total eighteencompounds were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit the functionof topo I and IIα, and proliferation of human breast (T47D), colorectal (HCT15), and cervix (HeLa) cancer cells. Except compound 11, all of the tested compoundsdisplayed selective topo IIα inhibitory activity. Compounds 8-18, 22, 24, and 25 showed excellent topo IIα inhibitory activity than a positive control, etoposide.Most of the compounds appeared to be superior to reference compounds in theirantiproliferative activity. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) study has shownthat it is better to place the hydroxyphenyl group at the 4-position of thecentral pyridine for superior topo IIα inhibition and antiproliferative activity.Similarly, the 3'-, or 4'-hydroxyphenyl substitution at the 2- and 4-positon ofpyridine ring is important for better activity than 2'-substitution.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
