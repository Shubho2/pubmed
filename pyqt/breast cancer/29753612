Electronic address: guenther.rezniczek@rub.de.INTRODUCTION: Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is a newmeans of delivering chemotherapy into the abdomen of patients with peritonealcarcinomatosis (PC). The amount of drug uptake in ascites and peritoneum afterPIPAC is unknown.METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of women with PC from gynecological tumorscomparing the concentrations of cisplatin and doxorubicin in ascites andperitoneum before and after PIPAC. Concentrations were measured using gaschromatography. Peritoneal tumor samples were assessed for histological tumorregression.RESULTS: 59 PIPAC procedures were performed in 32 women with PC. Theconcentrations of doxorubicin and cisplatin in ascites significantly increasedafter PIPAC (140.2 ± 671.5 vs 9035.7 ± 5328.6 ng/ml; p < 0.0001 and 95.2 ± 106.4 vs 24,770.8 ± 11,710.8 ng/ml; p < 0.0001, respectively). Concentrations ofdoxorubicin and cisplatin in peritoneal tissue also significantly increased afterPIPAC (5.1 ± 0.7 vs 19.2 ± 38.6 ng/g; p = 0.007, and 81.9 ± 7.8 vs131.5 ± 134.4 ng/g; p = 0.005, respectively). On an individual patient level, asignificant uptake (>2-fold) of doxorubicin and cisplatin was observed in 57/59(97%) and 58/59 (98%) of cases in ascites and in 23/59 (39%) and 13/59 (22%) ofcases in the peritoneum. Uptake of cisplatin and doxorubicin were significantlycorrelated (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.33; p = 0.011). After repeatedPIPACs, doxorubicin uptake increased in peritoneal tumor tissue (p = 0.008).CONCLUSIONS: PIPAC leads to a significant chemotherapy uptake in both ascites andperitoneum, suggesting a bimodal cytotoxic effect of PIPAC via direct tissueuptake into peritoneal tumor nodules and via ascites. Consecutive PIPACapplications lead to peritoneal accumulation of doxorubicin, suggesting acumulative cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin after repeated PIPACs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
