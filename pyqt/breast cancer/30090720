Data about terminology and grading of NETsin rare locations are scarce and variable, and they have been reported mainly as case reports.Materials and Methods: We here describe our experience with NETs in unusuallocations. We have reviewed all NETs diagnosed in our institution and summarized their clinicopathological features. We have also reviewed the literature anddiscussed the main characteristics of NETs in each site.Results: Two hundred and forty-three primary NETs were diagnosed. About 55.2% of patients were men and the mean age was 62 years. About 90.7% of NETs were locatedin lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or pancreas, and 50.8% of them were low-gradetumors. We identified 13 NETs in rare locations: breast, ovary, endometrium,vulva, uterine cervix, extrahepatic biliary tract, kidney, sinonasal tract, andthymus. Three additional tumors were diagnosed by the senior author in otherinstitution. Patients were asymptomatic or presented with nonspecific symptoms.All NETs were treated with surgery and 31% of patients received adjuvant therapy.There were 10 Grade 3 (62.5%), 2 Grade 2 (12.5%), and 4 Grade 1 (25%) tumors.Mean follow-up was 72 months. About 60% of G3 tumors recurred or progressed. G2tumors were located in breast, and both patients are stable. About 50% of G1tumors recurred or progressed (both renal NETs).Conclusions: NETs in rare locations are heterogeneous, and their behavior doesnot seem to correlate absolutely with tumor grade. More studies are needed toclarify the role of proliferation rate in these tumors.DOI: 10.4103/ijem.IJEM_446_17 PMCID: PMC6063171PMID: 30090720
