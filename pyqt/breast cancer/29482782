Electronic address:priyasrinivas@rgcb.res.in.Reports till its discovery has proven multiple facets of Breast Cancer type 1susceptibility gene (BRCA1) from nucleus to cytoplasm; from DNA repair to drugresistance; from Homologous Recombination (HR) to Ubiquitination; from breast to brain; from cancer to HIV and many of the roles are still unexplored. One of the recent attractions of BRCA1 is its role in regulating breast cancer metastasisthough the exact mechanism is poorly understood. In this review, we will discuss the molecular interactions between BRCA1 and the key molecules of Epithelial toMesenchymal Transition (EMT) associated with metastasis, its associated drugresistance and the possible treatment strategy for BRCA1 mutated breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
