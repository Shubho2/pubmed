Vibration training has been shown to be helpful in reducing boneturnover in postmenopausal women without cancer.AIM: To examine the effect of vibration stimulus on markers of bone turnover inbreast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors.METHODS: Thirty-one breast cancer survivors undergoing treatment with aromataseinhibitors were randomized to vibration stimulus (n = 14) or usual care control(n = 17). Low-frequency and low-magnitude vibration stimulus (27-32 Hz, 0.3 g)was delivered in supervised sessions via standing on a vibration platform for 20 minutes, 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was blood markers of bone resorption (serum N-telopeptide X/creatine) and formation (serum type 1procollagen N-terminal propeptide; P1NP). Other study outcomes body compositionas well as measures of physical functioning. Outcomes were compared betweengroups using analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values as well as time on aromatase inhibitors.OUTCOMES: On average, participants were 61.5 years old and overweight (ie, bodymass index = 28.5 kg/m2). Following vibration training, there was no significant difference between groups for bone resorption (adjusted group difference 0.5, P =.929) or formation (adjusted group difference 5.3, P = .286). There were also no changes in any measure of physical functioning body composition.CONCLUSIONS: Short-term low-magnitude vibration stimulus does not appear to beuseful for reducing markers of bone turnover secondary to aromatase inhibitors inbreast cancer patients; nor is it useful in improving physical function orsymptoms. However, further investigations with larger samples and higher doses ofvibration are warranted.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry(ACTRN12611001094965).DOI: 10.1177/1534735418781489 PMID: 29952241
