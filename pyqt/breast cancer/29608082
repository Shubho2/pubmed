Research suggeststhat survivors' SH concerns are not being adequately addressed in oncology orprimary care settings. It is important to understand why these conversations are not taking place and what can be done to enhance care for women in this context. This research aims to identify when clinicians initiate SH conversations withsurvivors and to uncover factors that influence these decisions.METHOD: Thirty-six clinicians from family medicine, internal medicine, oncology, and gynecology participated in semistructured interviews. Analysis uncoveredthemes that influence clinicians' decisions about initiating SH conversationswith survivors. Attention was given to capturing the personal, professional, and system-level issues that inform clinicians' communication choices.RESULTS: Clinicians reported their decisions are based on (a) beliefs aboutpatients, (b) inability to address survivors' concerns, (c) time constraints thataffect the delivery of care, and (d) views of professional function in survivorhealth care.DISCUSSION: Clinician decisions are based on sometimes-erroneous assumptions and situational constraints. This suggests the need for medical education and supportregarding SH care. Several practice points are outlined to facilitate clinicians'efforts to improve SH care for female BC survivors.
