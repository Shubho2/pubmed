[Epub ahead of print]Metformin in cancer.Mallik R(1), Chowdhury TA(2).Author information: (1)(a)International Training Fellow in Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Diabetes and Metabolism, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK.(2)Department of Diabetes and Metabolism, Barts and the London School of Medicineand Dentistry, London, UK. Electronic address:Tahseen.Chowdhury@bartshealth.nhs.uk.Metformin is a lipophilic biguanide which inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis andimproves peripheral utilization of glucose. It is the first line pharmacotherapy for glucose control in patients with Type 2 diabetes due to its safety, efficacy and tolerability. Metformin exhibits pleotropic effects, which may havebeneficial effects on a variety of tissues independent of glucose control. Apotential anti-tumourigenic effect of metformin may be mediated by its role inactivating AMP-kinase, which in turn inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR). Non-AMPK dependent protective pathways may include reduction of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, leptin, inflammatory pathways and potentiation ofadiponectin, all of which may have a role in tumourigenesis. A role in inhibitingcancer stem cells is also postulated. A number of large scale observational andcohort studies suggest metformin is associated with a reduced risk of a number ofcancers, although the data is not conclusive. Recent randomised studies reportinguse of metformin in treatment of cancer have revealed mixed results, and theresults of much larger randomised trials of metformin as an adjuvant therapy inbreast and colorectal cancers are awaited.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
