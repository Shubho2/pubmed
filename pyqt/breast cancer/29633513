Effective prognostic methods andtherapeutic targets for TNBC are required to improve patient outcomes. Here, wereport that acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member E (ANP32E), whichpromotes cell proliferation in mammalian development, is highly expressed in TNBCcells compared to other types of breast cancer. High expression of ANP32Ecorrelates significantly with worse overall survival (OS; P < 0.001) and higherrisks of disease recurrence (P < 0.001) in patients with TNBC. Univariate andmultivariate Cox-regression models show that ANP32E is an independent prognostic factor in TNBC. Furthermore, we discovered that ANP32E promotes tumorproliferation in vitro by inducing G1/S transition, and ANP32E inhibitionsuppresses tumor formation in vivo. By examining the expression of E2F1, cyclinE1, and cyclin E2, we discovered that ANP32E promotes the G1/S transition bytranscriptionally inducing E2F1. Taken together, our study shows that ANP32E isan efficient prognostic marker, and it promotes the G1/S transition and inducestumorigenesis of TNBC cells by transcriptionally inducing E2F1.© 2018 The Authors.
