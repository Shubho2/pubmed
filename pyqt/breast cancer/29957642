These articles not only chronicle nursing's growth as a profession within thecontext of the events of the day, but they also reveal prevailing societalattitudes about women, health care, and human rights. Today's nursing schoolcurricula rarely include nursing's history, but it's a history worth knowing. To this end, From the AJN Archives highlights articles selected to fit today'stopics and times.This April 1915 article was written by surgeon HowardLilienthal, the fifth president of the American Association for Thoracic Surgery and the sole author of the first English-language textbook on thoracic surgery.Here he writes to enlist nurses in the early recognition of breast cancer inorder to "control this disease by the only means now known"-that is, earlydiagnosis and immediate surgery. "Your knowledge will enable you to speak withauthority and you, almost as much as the surgeon who operates, may be concernedin saving a useful life."Today, routine mammography can identify breast cancerbefore it is symptomatic, but there is not yet consensus among key organizations about when screening should begin or how often it should be done. In this issue, Roberta Baron and colleagues review the breast cancer screening guidelines of theAmerican Cancer Society, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and theNational Comprehensive Cancer Network to help nurses better interpret and usethese recommendations.DOI: 10.1097/01.NAJ.0000541438.45627.5c PMID: 29957642
