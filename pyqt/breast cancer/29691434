Studies on disease-associated miRNA havecontributed to disease diagnosis and treatment. To address the problems, such as low prediction accuracy and failure to predict the relationship between newmiRNAs and diseases and so on, we design a Laplacian score of graphs to calculatethe global similarity of networks and propose a Global Similarity method based ona Two-tier Random Walk for the prediction of miRNA-disease association (GSTRW) toreveal the correlation between miRNAs and diseases. This method is a globalapproach that can simultaneously predict the correlation between all diseases andmiRNAs in the absence of negative samples. Experimental results reveal that this method is better than existing approaches in terms of overall prediction accuracyand ability to predict orphan diseases and novel miRNAs. A case study on GSTRWfor breast cancer and conlon cancer is also conducted, and the majority ofmiRNA-disease association can be verified by our experiment. This study indicatesthat this method is feasible and effective.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-24532-7 PMCID: PMC5915491PMID: 29691434
