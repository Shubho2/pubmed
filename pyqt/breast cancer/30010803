[Epub ahead of print]Selective killing of human breast cancer cells by the styryl lactone(R)-goniothalamin is mediated by glutathione conjugation, induction of oxidative stress and marked reactivation of the R175H mutant p53 protein.Punganuru SR(1), Madala H(1), Arutla V(1), Srivenugopal KS(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Texas TechUniversity Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX, USA.The molecular basis of anticancer and apoptotic effects of R-goniothalamin (GON),a plant secondary metabolite was studied. We show that induction of oxidativestress and reactivation of mutant p53 underlie the strong cytotoxic effects ofGON against the breast cancer cells. While GON was not toxic to the MCF10a breastepithelial cells, the SKBR3 breast cancer cells harboring an R175H mutant p53were highly sensitive (IC50 = 7.3 ÂµM). Flow cytometry and other pertinent assays showed that GON induced abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathionedepletion, protein glutathionylation and activation of apoptotic markers. GON wasfound to conjugate with glutathione both in vitro and in cells and the productwas characterized by mass spectrometry. We hypothesized that the redox imbalance induced by GON may affect the structure of the R175H mutant p53 protein, andaccount for greater cytotoxicity. Using the SKBR3 breast cancer and p53-nullH1299 lung cancer cells stably expressing the R175H p53 mutant protein, wedemonstrated that GON triggers the appearance of a wild-type-like p53 protein by using conformation-specific antibodies, immunoprecipitation, DNA-binding assaysand target gene expression. p53-restoration was associated with a G2/M arrest,senescence, reduced cell migration, invasion and increased cell death. GONelicited a highly synergistic cytotoxicity with cisplatin in SKBR3 cells. InSKBR3 xenografts developed in nude mice, there was a marked tumor growth delay byGON alone and GON + cisplatin combination. Our studies highlight the impact oftumor redox-stress generated by GON in activating the mutant p53 protein forgreater antitumor efficacy.DOI: 10.1093/carcin/bgy093 PMID: 30010803
