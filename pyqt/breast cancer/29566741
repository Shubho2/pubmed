The amino acid transporter, SLC7A5, plays a role in BC although its impact on patient outcome in different BC subtypesremains to be validated. This study aimed to determine whether theclinicopathological and prognostic value of SLC7A5 is different within themolecular classes of BC.METHODS: SLC7A5 was assessed at the genomic level, using Molecular Taxonomy ofBreast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) data (n = 1980), and proteomic level, using immunohistochemical analysis and tissue microarray (TMA) (n = 2664; 1110 training and 1554 validation sets) in well-characterised primary BC cohorts.SLC7A5 expression correlated with clinicopathological and biological parameters, molecular subtypes and patient outcome.RESULTS: SLC7A5 mRNA and protein expression were strongly correlated with larger tumour size and higher grade. High expression was observed in triple negative(TN), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+, and luminal B subtypes.SLC7A5 mRNA and protein expression was significantly associated with theexpression of the key regulator of tumour cell metabolism, c-MYC, specifically inluminal B tumours only (p = 0.001). High expression of SLC7A5 mRNA and proteinwas associated with poor patient outcome (p <â€‰0.001) but only in the highlyproliferative oestrogen receptor (ER)+/ luminal B (p = 0.007) and HER2+ classesof BC (p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, SLC7A5 protein was an independentrisk factor for shorter breast-cancer-specific survival only in ER+high-proliferation tumours (p = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: SLC7A5 appears to play a role in the aggressive highly proliferativeER+ subtype driven by MYC and could act as a potential therapeutic target.Functional assessment is necessary to reveal the specific role played by thistransporter in the ER+ highly proliferative subclass and HER2+ subclass of BC.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0946-6 PMCID: PMC5863851PMID: 29566741
