Lean body mass loss is associated with survival, quality of life and tolerance to treatment in cancer patients. The aim of our study is toanalyse the association between toxicities and sarcopenia in early breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant treatment.Materials and Methods: Breast cancer patients who have receivedanthracycline-based adjuvant treatment were retrospectively enrolled. CT scanimages performed before, during and after adjuvant chemotherapy were used toevaluate lean body mass at third lumbar vertebra level with the software SliceOmatic V 5.0.Results: 21 stage I-III breast cancer patients were enrolled. According to theskeletal muscle index at third lumbar vertebra cut-off ≤38.5 cm2/m2, 8 patients(38.1%) were classified as sarcopenic before starting treatment, while 10patients (47.6%) were sarcopenic at the end of treatment. A lower baseline L3skeletal muscle index is associated with G3-4 vs G0-2 toxicities (33.4 cm2/m2(31.1-39.9) vs 40.5 cm2/m2 (33.4-52.0), p = 0.028). Similarly skeletal musclecross sectional area was significantly lower in patients with G3-4 toxicities(86.7 cm2 (82.6-104.7) vs 109.0 cm2 (83.3-143.9), p = 0.017). L3 skeletal muscle index is an independent predictor of severe toxicity (p = 0.0282) in multivariateanalysis.Conclusion: Lean body mass loss is associated with higher grade of toxicity inearly breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25394 PMCID: PMC5986630PMID: 29876019
