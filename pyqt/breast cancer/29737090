The methylation rate of gene promoter was correlated withE-cadherin and tumor size ( P<0.05).CONCLUSION: The mRNA expression and promoter methylation rate of ASPH gene mayplay a role in the development and progression of breast cancer.CopyrightCopyrightÂ© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).PMID: 29737090
