Although chemotherapeutic drugsremain the main stay of cancer treatment, it is observed that toxicity to normal cells poses a limitation to their therapeutic values. Moreover, the patientrecovery rate from advanced breast cancer by chemotherapy is still unacceptablylow. Tetrahydroisoqinoline derivatives (THIQs) were reported to act as selective subtype estrogen receptor antagonists/agonists and may serve as potentialtherapeutic agents for breast cancer. In continuation of previous work wesystematically synthesized and characterized the tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQs)analogs. In-vitro antiproliferative activity of new substitutedtetrahydroisoquinoline analogs were evaluated against human ER (+) MCF-7(breast), ER (-) MDA-MB-231 (breast) and Ishikawa (endometrial) cancer cell linesusing the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay. The most activecompounds obtained in this study were 2b, 2i, and 3 g as demonstrated by theiractivity (IC50=0.2 μg/mL, 0.08 μg/mL; 0.61 μg/mL, 0.09 μg/mL; 0.25 μg/mL, 0.11μg/mL) against MCF-7 and Ishikawa cell lines respectively, in comparison toTamoxifen activity (IC50=3.99 μg/mL, 7.87 μg/ml). The newly synthesized moleculeswere docked in the active sites of the ER-α (PDB: 3ERT), ER-β (PDB: 1QKN) andalpha-beta tubulin taxol complex (1JFF) crystal structures to determine theprobable binding modes (bioactive conformations) of the active compounds.DOI: 10.4172/1948-5956.1000470 PMCID: PMC5802351PMID: 29430288
