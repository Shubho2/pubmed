Electronicaddress: qinhe@scu.edu.cn.Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) which shape the tumor microenvironment (TME)and the presence of blood brain barrier (BBB) remain great challenges intargeting breast cancer and its brain metastasis. Herein, we reported a strategy using PTX-loaded liposome co-modified with acid-cleavable folic acid (FA) and BBBtransmigrating cell penetrating peptide dNP2 peptide (cFd-Lip/PTX) for enhanceddelivery to orthotopic breast cancer and its brain metastasis. Compared withsingle ligand or non-cleavable Fd modified liposomes, cFd-Lip exhibitedsynergistic TME targeting and BBB transmigration. Moreover, upon arrival at theTME, the acid-cleavable cFd-Lip/PTX showed sensitive cleavage of FA, whichreduced the hindrance effect and maximized the function of both FA and dNP2peptide. Consequently, efficient targeting of folate receptor (FR)-positive tumorcells and FR-negative CAFs was achieved, leading to enhanced anti-tumor activity.This strategy provides a feasible approach to the cascade targeting of TME andBBB transmigration in orthotopic and metastatic cancer treatment.Copyright Â© 2018.
