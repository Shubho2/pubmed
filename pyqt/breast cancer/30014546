TheChinese version of the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire was modified and used to collect data.RESULTS: Of the 16 common symptoms of breast cancer, the participants recognized only 2.81 symptoms, on average. Of the 6 causal factors, "uncontrollable factors"had the highest mean score, while "behavioural factors" received the lowestscore. Most of the participants knew little about the disease, perceived thatthis illness is cyclic in nature and would not last for a long time, believedthat the illness could have serious consequences but could be controlled, andreported having negative emotional responses to this illness. Most of thedimensions of illness perception were significantly correlated with one another. Furthermore, some socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were confirmedto be predictors of illness perceptions.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that illness perceptions should be regardedas a whole to guide the coping process of Chinese women with breast cancer andprovide new clinical information to support care for this group.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ijn.12677 PMID: 30014546
