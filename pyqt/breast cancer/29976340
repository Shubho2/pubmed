This studyevaluated the feasibility of transferring such a nursing 'toolkit' to anotherhealth profession.METHOD: This evaluation was structured around a one-day workshop where a nurseconsultant impact toolkit was appraised and tested within the context ofconsultant radiographic practice. The adapted toolkit was subsequently validated using a larger sample at a national meeting of consultant radiographers.RESULTS: There was broad agreement that the tools could be adopted for use byradiographers although several themes emerged in relation to perceived gapswithin the nursing template, confirming the initial exercise. This resulted inamendments to the original scope and a proposed new evaluation tool.CONCLUSION: The impact toolkit could help assess individual and collaborat iverole impact at a local and national level. The framework provides consultantradiographers with an opportunity to understand and highlight the contributiontheir roles have on patients, staff, their organisation and the wider profession.Copyright Â© 2018 The College of Radiographers.
