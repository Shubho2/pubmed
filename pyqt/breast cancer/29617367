Limited breast-feeding could reflect abrupt or premature involutionand contribute to a "primed" stroma that is permissive to the migration of cancercells typical of IBC. We hypothesized that gene expression related to abruptmammary gland involution after forced weaning may be enriched in the tissues ofIBC patients and, if so, provide a potential correlation between limitedbreast-feeding and the development of aggressive breast cancer.METHODS: We utilized the Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) program tocluster significant signatures from two independent studies that analyzed geneexpression at multiple time-points of mouse mammary gland involution. Using 10significant signatures, we performed gene ontology analysis and gene setenrichment analysis (GSEA) on training and validation sets from human breastcancer gene expression data to identify specific genes that are enriched in IBCcompared to non-IBC and in TN compared to non-TN in IBC and non-IBC groups.RESULTS: Examining the combined data, we identified 10 involution gene clusters(Inv1-10) that share time-dependent regulation after forced weaning. Inv5 was theonly cluster significantly enriched in IBC in the training and validation set(nominal p-values <0.05) and only by unadjusted p-values (FDR q-values 0.26 and0.46 respectively). Eight genes in Inv5 are upregulated in both the training and validation sets in IBC. Combining the training and validation sets, both Inv5 andInv6 have nominal p-values <0.05 and q-values 0.39 and 0.20, respectively. Thetime course for both clusters includes genes that change within 12 hours afterforced weaning.CONCLUSIONS: Results from this in silico study suggest correlation betweenmolecular events during abrupt involution and aggressive breast cancer.Specifically, candidate genes from Inv5 merit functional investigation regarding the role of limited breast-feeding in IBC development.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0192689 PMCID: PMC5884491PMID: 29617367  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
