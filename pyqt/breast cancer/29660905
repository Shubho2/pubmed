Time-domainbeat-to-beat indexes and their variability parameters were calculated. Spectralindexes were calculated using the Morlet wavelet transform.RESULTS: The beat-to-beat LDF pulse width and its variability were significantly smaller in cancer patients than in the controls. The energy contributions ofendothelial-, neural-, and myogenic-related frequency bands were alsosignificantly smaller in cancer patients.CONCLUSIONS: The present study has revealed significant differences in thebeat-to-beat and spectral indexes of skin-surface-acquired LDF signals betweencontrol subjects and breast-cancer patients. This illustrates that LDF indexesmay be useful for monitoring the changes in the MBF perfusion condition inducedby breast cancer. Since the breast-cancer patients were at TNM stages 0- 2, thepresent findings may aid the development of indexes for detecting breast cancer.DOI: 10.3233/CH-170295 PMID: 29660905  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
