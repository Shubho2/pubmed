We assessed the understanding and knowledge of gynaecologists about breast cancer: screening, risk factors, clinical signs, management and common benignbreast diseases.METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Uttar Pradesh, India, from April to September 2017. One hundred and fifty-two gynaecologists wereassessed using a self-designed and validated questionnaire to assess theknowledge of risk factors, clinical signs, screening practices and management of breast cancer as well as common benign breast diseases. Further, the results werecompared based on their education: undergraduates (UGs; no residency experiencein obstetrics and gynaecology) versus postgraduates (PGs; residency experience inobstetrics and gynaecology).RESULTS: 67 and 82.2% of gynaecologists possess excellent to very good knowledge of risk factors and clinical signs of breast cancer, respectively. The knowledge of PGs seems to be better than UGs (p < 0.01). 84.9% participants were aware thatbreast cancer screening decreases breast cancer-related mortality, and 61.2%considered CBE as most relevant screening investigation (66.1% PGs and 41.9% UGs;p = 0.04). 30.2% regularly offer breast cancer screening at their centre. 58.5%did not consider screening mammography as cost-effective for their patients(57.9% PGs and 61.3% UGs; p = 0.72), and 41.4% considered it to be atime-consuming process (39.7% PGs and 48.4% UGs; p = 0.38). 99.3% like to follow up a patient with familial breast cancer by themselves, and 0.7% like to referthem to specialist. 51.9% gynaecologists were convinced of breast conservationsurgery (BCS) as a surgical option, however 51.3% feared leaving diseased breast behind.CONCLUSION: Despite the knowledge regarding risk factors, clinical signs andtreatment of breast cancer and benign breast diseases was found adequate amongst the gynaecologists, this did not apply to their clinical practice. Structured andcontinuous training of gynaecologists is needed to improve the outcome ofpatients with breast diseases in terms of better management and reference.DOI: 10.1007/s00268-018-4740-5 PMID: 30051242
