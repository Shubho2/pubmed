It is well established that the complexity of carcinogenesis involves profoundepigenetic deregulations that contribute to the tumorigenesis process.Deregulated H3 and H4 acetylated histone marks are amongst those alterations.Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is a class-III histone deacetylase deeply involved inapoptosis, genomic stability, gene expression regulation and breasttumorigenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which SIRT1regulates H3 and H4 acetylated marks, and consequently cancer-related geneexpression in breast cancer, remains uncharacterized. In this study, weelucidated SIRT1 epigenetic role and analyzed the link between the latter andhistones H3 and H4 epigenetic marks in all 5 molecular subtypes of breast cancer.Using a cohort of 135 human breast tumors and their matched normal tissues, aswell as 5 human-derived cell lines, we identified H3k4ac as a new prime target ofSIRT1 in breast cancer. We also uncovered an inverse correlation between SIRT1and the 3 epigenetic marks H3k4ac, H3k9ac and H4k16ac expression patterns. Weshowed that SIRT1 modulates the acetylation patterns of histones H3 and H4 inbreast cancer. Moreover, SIRT1 regulates its H3 acetylated targets in asubtype-specific manner. Furthermore, SIRT1 siRNA-mediated knockdown increaseshistone acetylation levels at 6 breast cancer-related gene promoters: AR, BRCA1, ERS1, ERS2, EZH2 and EP300. In summary, this report characterizes for the firsttime the epigenetic behavior of SIRT1 in human breast carcinoma. These novelfindings point to a potential use of SIRT1 as an epigenetic therapeutic target inbreast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25771 PMCID: PMC6078139PMID: 30093977
