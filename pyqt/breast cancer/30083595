To determine theclinicopathological features driving the emergence of the ESR1 mutations westudied plasma cfDNA and detailed clinical data collected from patients withmetastatic breast cancer. Droplet Digital PCR was performed for the detection of the most common ESR1 mutations and PIK3CA mutations. Among the patients withER + /HER2- disease, ESR1 mutations were detected in 30% of the patients. Therewere no associations between the pathological features of the primary disease or time to distant recurrence and the emergence of ESR1 mutations in metastaticdisease. The prevalence of the ESR1 mutations was significantly associated withprior treatment with an aromatase inhibitor in the adjuvant or metastaticsetting. The prevalence of the ESR1 mutations was also positively associated withprior fulvestrant treatment. Conversely, the prevalence of ESR1 mutations waslower after treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. There were no significantassociations between specific systemic treatments and the prevalence of PIK3CAmutations. These results support the evolution of the ESR1 mutations under theselective pressure of treatment with aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant andmetastatic settings and have important implications in the optimization ofadjuvant and metastatic treatment in ER + breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0075-5 PMCID: PMC6072793PMID: 30083595
