Moreover, combining hydrophobic and hydrophilicdrugs create erratic biodistribution and suboptimal medicinal outcome. Hence,packaging multiple drugs of diverse mechanisms of action and biodistribution for safe delivery into tumor tissues with optimal dosages is indispensable fornext-generation breast cancer therapy. To address these, in this report, wedescribe a unique cisplatin-triggered self-assembly of linear polymer into3D-spherical sub 200 nm particles. These nanoparticles comprise a hydrophobic(paclitaxel) and hydrophilic drug (cisplatin) simultaneously in a singleparticle. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed hydrophilic-hydrophilicinteraction and interchain H-bonding as underlying mechanisms of self-assembly.Confocal microscopy studies evidently demonstrated that these novel nanoparticlescan home into lysosomes in breast cancer cells, fragment subcellular nuclei, and prevent cell division, leading to improved breast cancer cell death compared tofree drug combination. Moreover, 3D-breast tumor spheroids were reducedremarkably by the treatment of these nanoparticles within 24 h. Thesedual-drug-loaded self-assembled polymeric nanoparticles have prospective to betranslated into a clinical strategy for breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b01400 PMCID: PMC6044771PMID: 30023590
