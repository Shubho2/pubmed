Numerous studies haveindicated that paracrine interactions from non-neoplastic cells impact themigratory and invasive properties of cancer cells. Thus, these interactions arepotential targets for anticancer therapies. In this study, we showed that theflavones member baicalein suppresses the motility of breast cancer cells that is promoted by paracrine interactions. First, we identified laminin-332 (LN-332) as a principle paracrine factor in conditioned medium from mammaryepithelium-derived MCF10A cells that regulates the morphology and motility ofbreast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells. Then, we carried out a morphology-basedscreen for small compounds, which showed that baicalein suppressed themorphological changes and migratory activity of MDA-MB-231 cells that wereinduced by conditioned medium from MCF10A cells and LN-332. We also found thatbaicalein caused narrower and incomplete lamellipodia formation in conditionedmedium-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, although actin dynamics downstream of Rho familysmall GTPases were unaffected. These results suggest the importance of mammaryepithelial cells in the cancer microenvironment promoting the migratory activity of breast adenocarcinoma cells and show a novel mechanism through which baicaleininhibits cancer cell motility.Â© 2018 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/gtc.12584 PMID: 29667279
