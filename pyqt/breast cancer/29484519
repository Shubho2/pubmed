Itwas conceived in response to how preclinical scientific research is sometimespresented to non-scientists in a way that can cause stress and confusion.Translation of preclinical findings to the clinic requires overcoming multiplebarriers. This is irrespective of whether the findings relate to excitingresponses to new therapies or problematic effects of currently used therapies. Itis important that these barriers are understood and acknowledged when researchfindings are summarized for mainstream reporting. To minimize confusion, patientsshould continue to rely on their oncology care team to help them interpretwhether research findings presented in mainstream media have relevance for their individual care. Researchers, both bench and clinical, should work together wherepossible to increase options for patients with metastatic disease, which is stillin desperate need of effective therapeutic approaches.DOI: 10.1007/s10585-017-9872-8 PMID: 29484519
