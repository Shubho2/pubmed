We show that high and intermediate HER2-expressing cancercell lines are driven toward apoptosis and tumor senescence when treated witheither CD4+ Th1 cells, or Th1 cytokines TNF-α and IFN-γ, in a dose dependentmanner. Depletion of HER2 activity by either siRNA or trastuzumab and pertuzumab,and subsequent treatment with either anti-HER2 Th1 cells or TNF-α and IFN-γresulted in synergistic increased tumor senescence and apoptosis in cells bothsensitive and cells resistant to trastuzumab which was inhibited by neutralizing anti-TNF-α and IFN-γ. Th1 cytokines induced minimal senescence or apoptosis intriple negative breast cancer cells (TNBC); however, inhibition of EGFR incombination with Th1 cytokines sensitized those cells causing both senescence andapoptosis. TNF-α and IFN-γ led to increased Stat1 phosphorylation through serine and tyrosine sites and a compensatory reduction in Stat3 activation. Single agentIFN-γ enhanced Stat1 phosphorylation on tyrosine 701 and similar effects wereobserved in combination with TNF-α and EGFR inhibition. These results demonstrateTh1 cytokines and anti-oncodriver blockade cooperate in causing tumor senescence and apoptosis in TNBC and HER2-expressing breast cancer, suggesting thesecombinations could be explored as non-cross-reactive therapy preventingrecurrence in breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25208 PMCID: PMC5955413PMID: 29796172
