After 18+ years of follow-up, 597 deaths were identified, 237 of which were breast cancerrelated. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs)and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Compared with never smokers, risk of all-cause mortality was elevatedamong the 19% of at-diagnosis smokers (HR=1.69, 95% CI=1.36 to 2.11), those whosmoked 20 or more cigarettes per day (HR=1.85, 95% CI=1.42 to 2.40), women whohad smoked for 30 or more years (HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.28 to 2.05), and women who hadsmoked 30 or more pack-years (HR=1.82, 95% CI=1.39 to 2.37). Risk of all-causemortality was further increased among the 8% of women who were at-/post-diagnosissmokers (HR=2.30, 95% CI=1.56 to 3.39) but was attenuated among the 11% women whoquit smoking after diagnosis (HR=1.83, 95% CI=1.32 to 2.52). Compared with never smokers, breast cancer-specific mortality risk was elevated 60% (HR=1.60, 95%CI=0.79 to 3.23) among at-/postdiagnosis current smokers, but the confidenceinterval included the null value and elevated 175% (HR=2.75, 95% CI=1.26 to 5.99)when we considered postdiagnosis cumulative pack-years. Conclusions: Smokingnegatively impacts long-term survival after breast cancer. Postdiagnosiscessation of smoking may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. Breast cancersurvivors may benefit from aggressive smoking cessation programs starting asearly as the time of diagnosis.DOI: 10.1093/jncics/pkx001 PMCID: PMC5875926PMID: 29608187
