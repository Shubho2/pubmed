However, SN38 is hydrolyzed in the physiologicalenvironment (pH 7.4), and this instability interferes with its potentialtherapeutic effect. Our objective was to investigate SN38-loaded liposomes toovercome the poor solubility of SN38 and its biodistribution, which furtherdiminish its toxicity.Materials and methods: The sub-100 nm targeted liposomes was employed to deliver SN-38 and evaluate the characterization, release behaviors, cytotoxicity, in vivopharmacokinetics and biochemical assay.Results: The SN38-loaded targeted liposomes consisted of small (100.49 nm)spherical nanoparticles with negative charge (-37.93 mV) and high entrapmentefficiency (92.47%). The release behavior of the SN38-loaded targeted liposomeswas fitted with Higuchi kinetics (R2=0.9860). Free SN38 presented initial burstrelease. The IC50 for the SN38-loaded targeted liposomes (0.11 μM) wassignificantly lower than for the SN38 solution (0.37 μM) in the MCF7 cell line(P<0.01). Confocal laser scanning microscopy also confirmed highly efficientaccumulation in the MCF7 cells. Pharmacokinetics demonstrated that theSN38-loaded targeted liposomes had a slightly increased half-life and meanresidence time and decreased area under the concentration-time curve and maximum concentration. The results suggested that retention was achieved while theexposure of SN38 was significantly decreased. A noninvasive in vivo imagingsystem also showed that the targeted liposomes selectively targeted MCF7 tumors. In vivo toxicity data demonstrated that the decrease in platelets wassignificantly improved by SN38-loaded targeted liposomes, and diarrhea was notobserved in BALB/c mice.Conclusion: In summary, SN38-loaded targeted liposomes could be a good candidate for application in human breast cancer.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S158426 PMCID: PMC5955381PMID: 29785106  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
