Through genome-wide associationstudies (GWAS), we have previously identified eight risk loci for endometrialcancer. Here, we present an expanded meta-analysis of 12,906 endometrial cancercases and 108,979 controls (including new genotype data for 5624 cases) andidentify nine novel genome-wide significant loci, including a locus on 12q24.12previously identified by meta-GWAS of endometrial and colorectal cancer. At five loci, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses identify candidatecausal genes; risk alleles at two of these loci associate with decreasedexpression of genes, which encode negative regulators of oncogenic signaltransduction proteins (SH2B3 (12q24.12) and NF1 (17q11.2)). In summary, thisstudy has doubled the number of known endometrial cancer risk loci and revealedcandidate causal genes for future study.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05427-7 PMID: 30093612
