Raman spectroscopy is promising for applications inradiobiological studies and as a technique for personalized radiation oncology,since it can detect spectral changes in irradiated tissues. In this study, weused established Raman spectroscopic approaches to investigate the biochemicalnature and temporal evolution of spectral changes in human breast adenocarcinoma xenografts after in vivo irradiation. Spectral alterations related to cell cycle variations with radiation dose were identified for tumors treated using a rangeof single-fraction ionizing radiation doses. Additional dose-dependent spectralchanges linked to specific proteins, nucleic acids and lipids were alsoidentified in irradiated tumors with a clear temporal evolution of the expressionof these signatures. This study reveals distinct shifts in Raman spectra after invivo irradiation of human breast adenocarcinoma xenografts, emphasizing thesignificance of Raman spectroscopy for assessing tumor response during radiation therapy.DOI: 10.1667/RR15003.1 PMID: 29474157  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
