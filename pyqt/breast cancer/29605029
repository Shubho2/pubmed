Thisstudy was performed to examine the accuracy of the present radiological imagingfor predicting the pathological complete response (pCR).METHODS: From 188 patients in our previous JONIE1 Study, a randomized controlled trial comparing chemotherapy with and without zoledronic acid for patients withhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, we evaluated 122patients whose tumor size was examined by magnetic resonance imaging orultrasound at three points: before NAC; after administering fluorouracil,epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide; and after NAC. The maximum tumor diameter wasevaluated by magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound. Tumor reduction ratioswere calculated at the same three points. The association between theradiological clinical response and the pCR was examined.RESULTS: Among the 122 patients evaluated, there were 98 and 24 patients withluminal (Lum) and triple-negative (TN) subtypes, respectively. There were nopatients who showed tumor progression after treatment. The radiological size ofthe tumors was finally reduced by an average of 58.4%. Clinical complete responseand pCR were achieved in 22 (18.0%) and 15 (12.3%) patients, respectively. In theoverall population (n = 122), the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity forpredicting pCR were 86.1%, 88.8%, and 66.7%, respectively. The negativepredictive value and false-negative rate were 45.5% and 11.2%, respectively.According to subtypes, the accuracies were 83.7% and 95.8% in Lum and TN,respectively. Negative predictive value and false-negative rate were markedlydifferent between the Lum (29.4% and 13.5%) and TN subtypes (100% and 0%),respectively.CONCLUSIONS: This randomized clinical trial demonstrated that NAC was safe foroperable breast cancer patients with appropriate radiological monitoring.Radiological evaluation after NAC may be a reliable method for predictingpathological response in the TN subtype, but not in the Lum subtype.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
