[Epub ahead of print]Association of pregnancy and mortality in women diagnosed with breast cancer: Anationwide population based study in Taiwan.Chuang SC(1), Lin CH(2), Lu YS(2)(3), Hsiung CA(1).Author information: (1)Institute of Population Health Sciences, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Miaoli County, Taiwan.(2)Department of Oncology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.(3)Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.We examined the associations between breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy andup to 5 years postpartum and total mortality. Breast cancer patients wereidentified from the Taiwan Cancer Registry (2002-2014). All pregnancies up to 5years before breast cancer diagnosis were abstracted from the National HealthInsurance database and data were then linked to the Taiwan National DeathCertificate Database. Follow-up was calculated from the date of breast cancerdiagnosis to the date of death or 31 December, 2014, whichever came first. Thehazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the associationbetween pregnancy and total mortality were estimated using Cox proportionalhazard models. Among the 30,230 breast cancer patients, 90 were diagnosed during pregnancy, 347 within a year postpartum, and 1993 during 1-5 years postpartum. Bythe end of 2014, 2920 patients were dead. The major cause of death was breastcancer (89%). Compared to patients without pregnancy records, the HRs were 1.42(95% CI=0.83-2.45) for patients diagnosed during pregnancy, 1.29 (0.96-1.74) for those diagnosed within a year postpartum, 1.27 (0.95-1.70) for those diagnosedwithin 1 to 2 years postpartum, and 1.06 (0.88-1.27) for those diagnosed â‰¥2 to 5 years postpartum, after adjustment for tumor characteristics and treatment.Subgroup analyses revealed an increased risk of mortality for patients diagnosed within a year postpartum in ER+ cancers (HR=2.11, 95% CI=1.28-3.47). Our results suggested a recent pregnancy may be associated with higher mortality among ER+patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.This article is protected by copyright.
