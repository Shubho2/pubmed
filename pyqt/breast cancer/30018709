The variant statuses of ILF2 inhuman breast cancer were evaluated using the COSMIC database. Altered ILF2expression in normal breast tissue relative to cancer tissue and in breast cancerpatients with different clinicopathological characteristics, molecular subtypes, clinical outcomes and chemotherapy responses were examined using the Oncomine,GOBO, Kaplan-Meier plotter and GEO datasets. To explore possible biologicalnetworks connected to ILF2 in breast cancer, we performed ingenuity pathwayanalysis on ILF2-related differentially expressed genes. We found that manybreast cancers had increased ILF2 copy number variations and increased ILF2expression. We also observed that elevated ILF2 expression was correlated withaggressive features, such as high histological grade, BRCA1 mutations, and thetriple-negative/basal-like subtype, which resulted in shorter survival in thesecases. Moreover, ILF2 expression predicted responses toanthracycline/taxane-based treatment. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed thatILF2-related biological functions included promoting cell survival, viability,and proliferation, as well as cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Certainwell-known oncogenes (MYC and HGF), cytokines (CSF2, IFNG and IL5) and microRNAs (miR-21, miR-155-5p and let-7) may participate in the ILF2 expression network in breast cancer. In summary, ILF2 is involved in the development and progression ofbreast cancer and may be a predictive biomarker for better responses toanthracycline/taxane-based treatments.PMCID: PMC6038075PMID: 30018709
