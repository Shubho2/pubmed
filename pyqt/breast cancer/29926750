Cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) are a groupof tumor-associated antigens that might serve as ideal targets for cancerimmunotherapy because of their cancer-restricted expression and robustimmunogenicity. Previous clinical studies reported that CTAs are associated with negative hormonal status, aggressive tumor behavior and poor survival.Furthermore, experimental studies have shown the ability of CTAs to induce bothcellular and humoral immune responses. They also demonstrated the implication of CTAs in promoting cancer cell growth, inhibiting apoptosis and inducing cancercell invasion and migration. In the current review, we attempt to address theimmunogenic and oncogenic potential of CTAs and their current utilization intherapeutic interventions for breast cancer.DOI: 10.2217/imt-2017-0179 PMID: 29926750
