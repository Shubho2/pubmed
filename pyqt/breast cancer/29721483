Treatment options for MBC depend on several factors, including where the cancer has spread,the patient's overall health, and the levels of hormone receptors and HER2 in thetumour. Over-expression of HER2 is generally considered to be a negativeprognostic feature because it accompanies an increase in breast cancer mortality.However, the development of agents that specifically target HER2 has improved themanagement of patients with these tumours.[7],[8],[9],[10] This expert group useddata from published literature, practical experience and opinion of a large groupof academic oncologists to arrive at these practical consensus recommendations inregards with the use of these agents and the management of HER2 positive MBC for the benefit of community oncologists.DOI: 10.4103/sajc.sajc_123_18 PMCID: PMC5909294PMID: 29721483
