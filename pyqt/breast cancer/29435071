China.The activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been demonstrated toplay important roles in breast carcinogenesis and to be associated with a poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. However, genetic mutation is not the majorreason for Wnt/β-catenin activation in breast cancer. Dishevelled-associatedantagonist of β-catenin homolog 2 (DACT2) is a negative regulator of β-cateninand acts as a tumor suppressor in numerous cancer types; however, the expression change and potential role of DACT2 in breast cancer is unknown. The present studydetected the expression and function of DACT2 in breast cancer progression. Itwas identified that the expression of DACT2 significantly decreased in breastcancer tissues compared with paired adjacent normal breast tissues. Additionalinvestigation demonstrated that the hypermethylation of DACT2 gene promotercontributes to the loss of the gene in breast cancer. It was also demonstratedthat DACT2 is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer and inhibits the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells by repressing the expression of β-catenintarget genes associated with tumor growth and metastasis. The present studyindicates that the loss of DACT2 may contribute to breast cancer progression and provides a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7633 PMCID: PMC5778863PMID: 29435071
