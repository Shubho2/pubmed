Given that breast cancer has been the focus of intense research, it is amenable to studying the benefitsof multi-omic prognostic models due to the availability of datasets. Thus, weexamined the efficacy of our methylation-to-expression feature model (M2EFM)approach to combining molecular and clinical predictors to create risk scores foroverall survival, distant metastasis, and chemosensitivity in breast cancer. Geneexpression, DNA methylation, and clinical variables were integrated via M2EFM to build models of overall survival using 1028 breast tumor samples and applied tovalidation cohorts of 61 and 327 samples. Models of distant recurrence-freesurvival and pathologic complete response were built using 306 samples andvalidated on 182 samples. Despite different populations and assays, M2EFM models validated with good accuracy (C-index or AUC ≥ 0.7) for all outcomes and had the most consistent performance compared to other methods. Finally, we demonstratedthat M2EFM identifies functionally relevant genes, which could be useful intranslating an M2EFM biomarker to the clinic.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-23494-0 PMCID: PMC5979962PMID: 29581450
