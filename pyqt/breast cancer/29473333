The aim of this study was toassess the incidence and survival of BCLM and associated risk factors. Patientswith BCLM were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results(SEER) database. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for BCLM. Predictors of factors associated with death wereanalyzed in Cox regression and Fine and Gray's test. Of the 11568 patients withstage IV breast cancer, 4213 (36.4%) had BCLM and 1214 (10.5%) had metastasesconfined to lungs. The median survival time for patients with BCLM was 21 months,and 15.5% of the patients were alive more than 3 years. The tumor subtypedistribution was 45.3% HR- /HER2- , 12.2% HR+ /HER2+ , 7.8% HR- /HER2+, and 15.0%triple-negative subtype. Compared with patients without BCLM, those with BCLMwere more likely to be aged, female, black, higher tumor grade, HR- /HER2+ , HR+ /HER2+, and triple-negative subtypes at diagnosis. Survival analysis showed that the aged, black race, HR- /HER2+ , triple-negative subtype, higher grade were theindependent risk factor for BCLM patients' survival, while HR+ /HER2+ subtype,insured status, and married status suggested better prognosis. In conclusion, theincidence and prognosis of BCLM varied by tumor subtypes, age, and race. Elderly patients with HER2-positive or triple-negative tumors were more likely to haveBCLM.© 2018 The Authors.
