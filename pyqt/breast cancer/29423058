China.The microenvironment of postpartum mammary gland involution (PMI) has been linkedto the increased risk of breast cancer and poor outcome of patients. Neverthelessthe mechanism underlying regulates the microenvironment remains largely unknown. MUC1, which is abnormally overexpressed in most breast cancer, is physiologicallyexpressed in PMI. Using MUC1 cytoplasm domain (MUC1-CD) transgenic mice, wereveal that the overexpression of MUC1-CD in mammary epithelial cells increasesM2 type macrophage infiltration in PMI. By sustain activating p50, MUC1upregulates M2 macrophage chemo-attractants and the anti-apoptotic proteinBcl-xL. Because of the tumor promotional microenvironments and reduced apoptosis,MUC1-CD delays PMI process and results in atypical phenotype in multiparous mice mammary. This finding is further supported by the positive association betweenthe expression of MUC1 and p50 in Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes throughanalyzing breast cancer databases. Taken together, our study demonstrates thatMUC1-CD plays an important role in regulating microenvironment of PMI andpromoting postpartum mammary tumorigenicity, providing novel prevention andtreatment strategies against postpartum breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23316 PMCID: PMC5790475PMID: 29423058
