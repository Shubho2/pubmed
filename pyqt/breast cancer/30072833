Thecurrent work aimed to test the effect of new pro-apoptotic heterosteroids on somedrug resistance related miRNAs expression levels (miRNA34a, 98, and 214) in MCF-7breast cancer cells. After cell treatment with these compounds 4, 6, 7, 13, 18,21, 22 and 24, miRNAs were extracted and subjected to reverse transcription andsubsequent PCR amplification using Real Time-PCR technique. The expression levelsof miR-34a, miR-98 and miR-214 were quantitatively determined. The study revealedthat the expression levels of miR-34a, miR-98 and miR-214 were up-regulated upon treatment with tamoxifen, which was used as a positive control drug, as compared to control cells,. Strikingly, the levels of miR-34a, miR-98 and miR-214expression were significantly down-regulated when treated with most of the newheterosteroids as compared to control cells. These results could indicate thepromising effects of these new heterosteroids on reducing drug resistance ascompared to tamoxifen drug. As well established, cells develop drug resistance totamoxifen.DOI: 10.1007/s12291-017-0681-2 PMCID: PMC6052734 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 30072833
