We developed composite gels constitutedby different concentrations of Alginate (A) and Matrigel (M) to obtain astructurally stable-in-time and biologically active substrate. Human aggressivebreast cancer cells (i.e. MDA-MB-231) were cultured within the gels. Known thelink between cell morphology and malignancy, cells were morphologicallycharacterized and their invasiveness correlated through an innovativebioreactor-based invasion assay. A particular type of gel (i.e. 50% Alginate, 50%Matrigel) emerged thanks to a series of significant results: 1. cells exhibitedpeculiar cytoskeleton shapes and nuclear fragmentation characteristic of theirmalignancy; 2. cells expressed the formation of the so-called invadopodia,actin-based protrusion of the plasma membrane through which cells anchor to theextracellular matrix; 3. cells were able to migrate through the gels and attachto an engineered membrane mimicking the vascular walls hosted within bioreactor, providing a completely new 3D in vitro model of the very precursor steps ofmetastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-23250-4 PMCID: PMC5871779PMID: 29593247
