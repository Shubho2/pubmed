Epub 2018 Feb 23.LncRNA HOTAIR influences cell growth, migration, invasion, and apoptosis via the miR-20a-5p/HMGA2 axis in breast cancer.Zhao W(1), Geng D(1), Li S(1), Chen Z(2), Sun M(2).Author information: (1)Department of General Surgery, Shengjing Hospital Affiliated China MedicalUniversity, Shenyang, 110004, Liaoning, China.(2)Department of Urology, Shengjing Hospital Affiliated China Medical University,Shenyang, 110004, Liaoning, China.To study the regulatory effect of lncRNA HOTAIR/miR-20a-5p/HMGA2 axis on breastcancer (BC) cell growth, cell mobility, invasiveness, and apoptosis. Themicroarray data of lncRNAs and mRNAs with differential expression in BC tissueswere analyzed in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. LncRNA HOX transcriptantisense RNA (lncRNA HOTAIR) expression in BC was assessed by qRT-PCR. Cellviability was confirmed using MTT and colony formation assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Cell mobility and invasiveness were testified by transwell assay. RNA pull-down and dual luciferaseassay were used for analysis of the correlation between lncRNA HOTAIR andmiR-20a-5p, as well as relationship of miR-20a-5p with high mobility groupAT-hook 2 (HMGA2). Tumor xenograft study was applied to confirm the correlationof lncRNA HOTAIR/miR-20a-5p/HMGA2 axis on BC development in vivo. The expression levels of the lncRNA HOTAIR were upregulated in BC tissues and cells. KnockdownlncRNA HOTAIR inhibited cell propagation and metastasis and facilitated cellapoptosis. MiR-20a-5p was a target of lncRNA HOTAIR and had a negativecorrelation with lncRNA HOTAIR. MiR-20a-5p overexpression in BC suppressed cellgrowth, mobility, and invasiveness and facilitated apoptosis. HMGA2 was a target of miR-20a-5p, which significantly induced carcinogenesis of BC. BC cellsprogression was mediated by lncRNA HOTAIR via affecting miR-20a-5p/HMGA2 in vivo.LncRNA HOTAIR affected cell growth, metastasis, and apoptosis via themiR-20a-5p/HMGA2 axis in breast cancer.Â© 2018 The Authors.
