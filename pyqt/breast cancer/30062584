This study sought to examine howinformation is exchanged between patients and clinicians during chemotherapytreatment regarding pain, depression, fatigue, and nausea experienced among themost prevalent non-English-speaking group in the USA, Hispanic breast cancersurvivors.METHODS: Hispanic breast cancer patients and clinicians participated in focusgroups to examine Hispanic breast cancer survivors' experience andpatient-physician communication of symptoms during chemotherapy. Three separatefocus groups (English language with patients, Spanish language with patients, andEnglish language with clinicians) were conducted. All participants completed ademographic questionnaire.RESULTS: Six breast cancer survivors participated in the English-language focusgroup, ten breast cancer survivors participated in the Spanish-language focusgroup, and five clinicians participated. Presence and communication of depressivesymptoms between the English- and Spanish-language groups differed, with themajority of the English-language group sharing their experiences of depressivesymptoms while those in the Spanish-language group did not report depressivesymptoms. Results also indicated that most patients were unhappy with theresponse of clinicians regarding their reported symptoms. Several barriers toeffective patient-clinician communication, including limited physician time, lackof patient knowledge, timidity, and language, were identified.CONCLUSION: The findings of this study underscore the need to improvepatient-physician communication during chemotherapy to reduce the symptom burden among Hispanic breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4375-y PMID: 30062584
