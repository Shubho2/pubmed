Otherstudies have followed suit, demonstrating that FOXC1 is not only a major playerin this breast cancer subtype, but also in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),endometrial cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).The FOXC1 gene encodes a transcription factor that is crucial to mesodermal,neural crest, and ocular development, and mutations found in FOXC1 have beenfound to cause dominantly inherited Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome (ARS).Interestingly, while FOXC1 missense mutations that are associated with ARSusually reduce gene activity, increased FOXC1 function now appears to be oftenlinked to more aggressive cancer phenotypes in BLBC, HCC, HL, and NHL. Thisreview discusses not only the role of FOXC1 in cancer cell progression,proliferation, differentiation, and metastasis, but also the underlyingmechanisms of how FOXC1 can contribute to aggressive cancer phenotypes.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.22742 PMCID: PMC5814291PMID: 29487724
