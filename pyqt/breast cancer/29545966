Theaim of this study was to examine the role of syndecan-binding protein (SDCBP)silencing in ER-positive BCa cells.Methods: In MCF-7/T47D cells, the effects of SDCBP silence/overexpression on cellproliferation and estrogenic response were examined. Cell proliferation wasexamined using the MTT assay and cell cycle regulators were examined by Westernblot. Estrogen response was examined from a luciferase activity and evaluation oftranscript levels of pS2 and progesterone receptor (PR) upon estrogenadministration. Samples of ER-positive BCa were stained with ERα, PR, and SDCBPantibodies, and their expression correlations were analyzed.Results: We found that SDCBP silencing inhibited the proliferation of ER-positiveBCa cells and arrested a greater number of cells in the G1 phase of the cellcycle compared to tamoxifen alone, while SDCBP overexpression limited theanti-cancer effects of tamoxifen. SDCBP silencing and overexpression alsoenhanced and attenuated the estrogenic response, respectively. Expression ofSDCBP was negatively correlated with PR, ERα, and the PR/ERα ratio in ER-positiveBCa tissue samples.Conclusions: SDCBP may be involved in tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive BCa.Tamoxifen treatment combined with SDCBP silencing may provide a novel treatmentfor endocrine therapy-resistant BCa.DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0122 PMCID: PMC5842332PMID: 29545966
