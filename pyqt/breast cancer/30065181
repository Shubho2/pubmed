However, very few of these receptors have been pursued as oncology drug targets. TheProtease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), which is a G-protein coupled receptor, has been shown to act as an oncogene and is an emerging anti-cancer drug target. Inthis paper, we provide an overview of PAR1's biased signaling role in metastatic cancers of the breast, lungs, and ovaries and describe the development of PAR1inhibitors that are currently in clinical use to treat acute coronary syndromes. PAR1 inhibitor PZ-128 is in a Phase II clinical trial and is being developed toprevent ischemic and thrombotic complication of patients undergoing cardiaccatheterization. PZ-128 belongs to a new class of cell-penetrating,membrane-tethered peptides named pepducins that are based on the intracellularloops of receptors targeting the receptor G-protein interface. Application ofPZ-128 as an anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic therapeutic agent in breast,lung, and ovarian cancer is being reviewed.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19082237 PMID: 30065181
