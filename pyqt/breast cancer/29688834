My Changed Body(MyCB) is a Web-based psychological intervention to alleviate BID and improvebody appreciation in survivors of breast cancer (BCSs) through a single-session, self-compassion focused writing activity. This randomized controlled trialevaluated the impact of MyCB on BID and body appreciation in BCSs. The moderatingeffect of lymphedema status (affected or unaffected) and appearance investment(self-importance placed on personal appearance) and the mediating effect ofself-compassion were evaluated. Patients and Methods Women (disease-free stage I to III BCSs who had experienced at least one negative event related to bodilychanges after breast cancer) were randomly assigned to MyCB (n = 149) or anexpressive writing control arm (n = 155). Primary outcomes were reduction in BID and improvement in body appreciation 1 week after intervention. Secondaryoutcomes included psychological distress (depression and anxiety) andself-compassion. Follow-up assessments occurred 1 week, 1 month, and 3 monthsafter writing. Results Compliance with the MyCB intervention was 88%, andattrition was 9.2%. Intent-to-treat linear mixed models indicated thatparticipants who received MyCB reported significantly less BID ( P = .035) andgreater body appreciation ( P = .004) and self-compassion ( P < .001) thanexpressive writing participants. Intervention effects on BID were moderated bylymphedema status ( P = .007) and appearance investment ( P = .042).Self-compassion mediated effects on both primary outcomes. Therapeutic effectswere maintained at 1 month (BID and body appreciation) and 3 months (bodyappreciation) after intervention. Significant reductions in psychologicaldistress (1-month depression, P = .001; 1-week and 1-month anxiety, P = .007)were evident for MyCB participants with lymphedema. Conclusion This studysupports the efficacy of MyCB for reducing BID and enhancing body appreciationamong BCSs.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.76.3318 PMID: 29688834
