Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association between 1100delC and breast cancer.RESULTS: Meta-analysis results suggested that 1100delC contributed to anincreased breast cancer risk in overall populations (OR 2.89; 95% CI 2.63-3.16). Subgroup analysis found ORs of 3.13 (95% CI 1.94-5.07) for male breast cancer,2.88 (95% CI 2.63-3.16) for female breast cancer, 2.87 (95% CI 1.85-4.47) forearly-onset breast cancer, 2.92 (95% CI 2.65-3.22) for invasive breast cancer,and 3.21 (95% CI 2.41-4.29) for familial breast cancer. The sensitivity analysis suggested that results of this meta-analysis were generally robust.CONCLUSION: CHEK2*1100delC is associated with an increased risk of both femaleand male breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s40291-018-0344-x PMID: 29909568
