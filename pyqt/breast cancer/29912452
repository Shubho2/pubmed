[Epub ahead of print]Genetic Predictors of Response to Acupuncture for Aromatase Inhibitor-Associated Arthralgia Among Breast Cancer Survivors.Genovese TJ(1), Mao JJ(2).Author information: (1)The Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.(2)Department of Integrative Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,New York, New York, USA.Objective: To evaluate the associations between polymorphisms in two genes,catechol-O-methyltransferase and T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 A, andacupuncture-mediated pain reduction among breast cancer survivors with aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia.Design, Setting, and Subjects: Biospecimens were obtained from 38 patientsenrolled in a clinical trial of acupuncture for aromatase inhibitor-associatedarthralgia in postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer survivors.Methods: We used polymerase chain reaction to genotype the rs4680 (Val158Met) andrs4633 (His62His) variants in the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene and rs2369049(A > G) and rs7158782 (A > G) variants in the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 A gene. Response to acupuncture was defined by 30% reduction in end-of-treatment average pain, measured by the Brief Pain Inventory. We used Fisher exact tests toevaluate associations between genotype and treatment response.Results: Among participants, all six (15.8%) subjects who expressed AA in locusrs4680 responded to acupuncture. In a combined analysis, the 18 (47.4%) subjects with the responder genotype at either rs4680 (AA) or rs2369049 (GG or AG) weresignificantly more likely to respond to acupuncture than those without (77.8% vs 45.0%, P = 0.039).Conclusions: Specific genetic variations at loci rs4680 and rs2369049 areassociated with response to acupuncture-type intervention for management ofarthralgia. These results serve as a proof of concept for applying a precisionmedicine framework to the study of cancer pain management.DOI: 10.1093/pm/pny067 PMID: 29912452
