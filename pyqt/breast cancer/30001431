In this study,we investigated the correlation between breast cancer prevalence andsocioeconomic status. This study enrolled 27,331 people who participated in theKorean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) IV-VI(2007-2015). In addition, we obtained data from the Korean StatisticalInformation Service (KSIS) on the breast cancer age-standardized incidence rate(AIR), the age-standardized mortality rate (AMR), the number of women screened,and the number of newly diagnosed patients. The KHANES data showed that breastcancer prevalence was significantly associated with educational level (odds ratio[OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-3.77 for 10-12 vs. ≤ 6 years ofeducation, and OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.10-5.06 for ≥ 13 vs. ≤ 6 years of education). However, there was no significant association of breast cancer prevalence withmonthly household income. In a separate analysis of the AIR, AMR, and number ofwomen screened for breast cancer, the AIR increased with the number of womenscreened, whereas the AMR did not. Furthermore, the number of newly diagnosedpatients in all age groups increased over time. The present results demonstratethat the recently increased breast cancer prevalence documented in South Koreamay be attributable to earlier detection rather than to a real increase inprevalence, and that breast cancer may be overdiagnosed.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200484 PMCID: PMC6042748PMID: 30001431
