Identifying methods to ensure that Latinas participate inand benefit from translational behavioral medicine research is important toreduce disparities. We developed a "Social Network Research Registry" to enhance Latina survivors' engagement in research and explored the social networks andresearch/cancer organization participation in this population. We initiallyrecruited 30 Latina breast cancer survivors ("seeds") from communityorganizations and identified other survivors through snowball sampling. Guided bySocial Network Analysis, we assessed the structural (e.g., size) and functional(e.g., social support) characteristics of the network, willingness to join theregistry, prior research participation, involvement in cancer organizations, and interest in different types of research and roles in research. The resultingnetwork size was 98, including 53 women who enrolled in the study and 45 who werelisted in the network but did not enroll. All enrolled participants (N = 53)agreed to be part of the registry. We identified 15 participants who occupiedstrategic positions as hubs and/or bridges. Women who were currently involved in cancer organizations were more likely to have participated in research (70.3% vs.18.8%); χ2 (1, 53) = 11.97, p = .001. Most were interested in surveys/interviews (98%), behavioral interventions (96%), and becoming health promoters (79%). TheSocial Network Research Registry is an acceptable and feasible strategy to engageunderrepresented Latina survivors in research. Social network analysis can beuseful to identify members who occupy key positions to enhance recruitment andtranslational efforts.DOI: 10.1093/tbm/ibx053 PMID: 30016517
