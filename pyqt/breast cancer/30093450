Purified single CTCs could be isolated from apheresis product by FACSsorting; copy number aberration (CNA) profiles of 185 single CTCs from 14patients revealed the genomic landscape of lethal prostate cancer and identified complex intra-patient, inter-cell, genomic heterogeneity missed on bulk biopsyanalyses.CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION: Apheresis facilitated the capture of large numbers of CTCsnon-invasively with minimal morbidity and allowed the deconvolution ofintra-patient heterogeneity and clonal evolution.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0862 PMID: 30093450
