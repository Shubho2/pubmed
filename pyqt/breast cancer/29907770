[Epub ahead of print]Na+,HCO3--cotransporter NBCn1 (Slc4a7) accelerates ErbB2-induced breast cancerdevelopment and tumor growth in mice.Lee S(1), Axelsen TV(1), Jessen N(1), Pedersen SF(2), Vahl P(3), Boedtkjer E(4).Author information: (1)Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.(2)Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.(3)Department of Pathology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.(4)Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.eb@biomed.au.dk.Metabolic acid production challenges cellular pH homeostasis in solid cancertissue, and mechanisms of net acid extrusion represent promising new targets for breast cancer therapy. Here, we used genetically engineered mice to investigatethe contribution of the Na+,HCO3--cotransporter NBCn1 (Slc4a7) to intracellularacid-base regulation in ErbB2-induced breast cancer tissue and the consequencesof NBCn1 knockout for breast tumor development and growth. We demonstrate anapproximately 2-fold increase of NBCn1 protein abundance in ErbB2-induced breast cancer tissue compared to normal breast tissue despite a 4-fold decrease in theNBCn1 mRNA level. In congruence, we show that NBCn1 facilitates net acidextrusion and elevates steady-state intracellular pH in breast cancer tissue.Disruption of NBCn1 expression delayed ErbB2-induced breast carcinogenesis from amedian tumor-free survival of 9.5 months in wild-type mice to 12 months inNBCn1-knockout mice and decelerated the tumor growth rate by approximately 1/3.Glycolytic metabolism-evaluated based on the interstitial concentrations oflactate and glucose measured in microdialysates-was increased in breast cancertissue compared to normal breast tissue, but was unaffected by NBCn1 knockout.Disruption of NBCn1 expression inhibited cell proliferation-evaluated by stainingfor the proliferative marker Ki67-particularly in central tumor areas withpredicted increase in acid loading from glycolytic metabolism. In conclusion,NBCn1 regulates intracellular pH in ErbB2-induced breast cancer tissue byproviding a pathway for cellular uptake of HCO3-, which can neutralize metabolic acidic waste products. Disrupting NBCn1 expression delays ErbB2-induced breastcancer development, inhibits cancer cell proliferation, and decelerates tumorgrowth.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0353-6 PMID: 29907770
