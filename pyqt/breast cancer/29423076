Our previous results indicate AR activation may increase let-7aexpression in breast cancer cells, while let-7, a tumor suppressor, is reportedto inhibit breast tumor-initiating cells (T-IC). The study aims to explore theeffects of AR/let-7a signaling on breast T-IC and its regulatory mechanism. Theresults revealed that the expression of AR was significantly associated withlet-7a and CD44+/24-/low especially in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breastcancer tissues. The expression of AR and let-7a indicated better outcome, whilepatients with CD44+/24-/low phenotype had worse prognosis. AR activation induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) prevented cells proliferation, migration, invasionand self-renewal capacities in ER+ breast cancer cells, via transcriptionalup-regulation of let-7a. In addition, AR could inhibit tumorigenesis andmetastasis of ER+ breast cancer cells in the serial xenotranplanted animalmodels. Our data suggested that AR/let-7a signaling could inhibit the biological behavior of tumor-initiating cells (T-IC) in ER+AR+ breast cancers, which mightbecome a new therapeutic target.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23196 PMCID: PMC5790493PMID: 29423076
