From September 2014 to June 2017, we identified patients with pathologically confirmed invasivebreast cancer who underwent NST. All patients had both CESM and MRI performedpre- and post-NST with pathological assessment after surgical management. Size ofresidual malignancy on post-NST CESM and MRI was compared with surgicalpathology. Lin concordance and Pearson correlation coefficient were used toassess agreement. Bland-Altman plots were used to visualize the differencesbetween tumor size on imaging and pathology.RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were identified. Mean age was 52.7 (range 30-76)years. Type of NST included chemotherapy in 53 (82%) and endocrine therapy in 12 (18%). Mean tumor size after NST was 14.6 (range 0-105) mm for CESM and 14.2 mm(range 0-75 mm) for MRI compared with 19.6 (range 0-100) mm on final surgicalpathology. Equivalence tests demonstrated that mean tumor size measured by CESM(p = 0.009) or by MRI (p = 0.01) was equivalent to the mean tumor size measuredby pathology within - 1 and 1-cm range. Comparing CESM versus MRI for assessment of complete response, the sensitivity was 95% versus 95%, specificity 66.7%versus 68.9%, positive predictive value 55.9% versus 57.6%, and negativepredictive value 96.7% versus 96.9% respectively.CONCLUSIONS: CESM was comparable to MRI in assessing residual malignancy aftercompletion of NST.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6413-x PMID: 29516362
