Exposures were false-positive breast, prostate, or colorectalcancer screening test results (repeat breast imaging or negative breast biopsy ≤3months after screening mammography, repeat prostate-specific antigen [PSA] test≤3 months after PSA test result ≥4.0 ng/mL or negative prostate biopsy ≤3 months after any PSA result, or negative colonoscopy [without biopsy/polypectomy] ≤6months after a positive fecal occult blood test). Outcomes were up-to-date statuswith breast or colorectal cancer screening. Covariates included prior screeninghistory, clinical information (eg, family history, obesity, and smoking status), comorbidity, and demographics.RESULTS: Women were more likely to be up to date with breast cancer screening if they previously had false-positive mammography findings (adjusted odds ratio[AOR], 1.43 [95% confidence interval, 1.34-1.51] without breast biopsy and AOR,2.02 [95% confidence interval, 1.56-2.62] with breast biopsy; both P<.001). Thesame women were more likely to be up to date with colorectal cancer screening(AOR range, 1.25-1.47 depending on breast biopsy; both P<.001). Men whopreviously had false-positive PSA testing were more likely to be up to date with colorectal cancer screening (AOR, 1.22 [P = .039] without prostate imaging/biopsyand AOR, 1.60 [P = .028] with imaging/biopsy). Results were stronger forindividuals with more false-positive results (all P≤.005). However, women withprevious false-positive colorectal cancer fecal occult blood test screeningresults were found to be less likely to be up to date with breast cancerscreening (AOR, 0.73; P<.001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients who previously had a false-positive breast or prostatecancer screening test were more likely to engage in future screening.
