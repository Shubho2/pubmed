The prospective open-label, randomized trial included an exploratory arm toinvestigate the preventive efficacy of heparinoid moisturizer for acute radiationdermatitis (ARD).Methods: Between April 2011 and April 2013, patients receiving WBRT were assigned(1:2:2) to receive either: moisturizer for prophylaxis (group P), moisturizerstarting 2 weeks after WBRT for treatment (group M), and no moisturizer (groupC). This paper presents the results of comparison between the exploratory arm andno moisturizer group. Skin WC was measured prior to WBRT, on the last day ofWBRT, and 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 3 months following WBRT. Signs and symptoms werealso assessed.Results: Comparing two groups, WC values were significantly higher in group Puntil 4 weeks following WBRT. At 2 weeks following WBRT, mean WC values in group P and C were 38.5 ± 6.1 arbitrary units (a.u.) and 30.2 ± 7.8 a.u., respectively (P < 0.001). In group C, dryness was more severe at 2 and 4 weeks following WBRT and desquamation more severe until 3 months following WBRT. However, the erythemascore showed no difference between the two groups. Regarding symptoms, group Cpain scores on the last day of WBRT were significantly higher than in group P (P < 0.030).Conclusions: The preventive application of heparinoid moisturizer has thepotential of reducing skin desquamation and dryness in patients receiving WBRT.DOI: 10.1093/jjco/hyy045 PMCID: PMC5926546PMID: 29635534  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
