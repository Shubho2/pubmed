China.The present study aimed to screen all types of RNAs involved in the developmentof papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). RNA‑sequencing data of PTC and normalsamples were used for screening differentially expressed (DE) microRNAs(DE‑miRNAs), long non‑coding RNAs (DE‑lncRNAs) and genes (DEGs). Subsequently,lncRNA‑miRNA, miRNA‑gene (that is, miRNA‑mRNA) and gene‑gene interaction pairswere extracted and used to construct regulatory networks. Feature genes in themiRNA‑mRNA network were identified by topological analysis and recursive feature elimination analysis. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was built using15 feature genes, and its classification effect was validated using twomicroarray data sets that were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. In addition, Gene Ontology function and Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes andGenomes pathway enrichment analyses were conducted for genes identified in theceRNA network. A total of 506 samples, including 447 tumor samples and 59 normal samples, were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); 16 DE‑lncRNAs,917 DEGs and 30 DE‑miRNAs were screened. The miRNA‑mRNA regulatory networkcomprised 353 nodes and 577 interactions. From these data, 15 feature genes with high predictive precision (>95%) were extracted from the network and were used toform an SVM classifier with an accuracy of 96.05% (486/506) for PTC samplesdownloaded from TCGA, and accuracies of 96.81 and 98.46% for GEO downloaded data sets. The ceRNA regulatory network comprised 596 lines (or interactions) and 365 nodes. Genes in the ceRNA network were significantly enriched in 'neurondevelopment', 'differentiation', 'neuroactive ligand‑receptor interaction','metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450', 'drug metabolism' and'cytokine‑cytokine receptor interaction' pathways. Hox transcript antisense RNA, miRNA‑206 and kallikrein‑related peptidase 10 were nodes in the ceRNA regulatory network of the selected feature gene, and they may serve import roles in thedevelopment of PTC.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9009 PMCID: PMC6059698PMID: 29767230
