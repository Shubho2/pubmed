HA typically begins with hemophilic synovitis (HS) that resembles inflammatory arthritides such asrheumatoid arthritis (RA) and frequently results in bone loss in patients. Amajor cause of RA is inappropriate release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumornecrosis factor α (TNFα) by the TNFα convertase (TACE, also referred to asADAM17) and its regulator, iRhom2. Therefore, we hypothesized thatiRhom2/ADAM17-dependent shedding of TNFα also has a pivotal role in mediating HA.Here, we show that addition of blood or its components to macrophages activatesiRhom2/ADAM17-dependent TNFα shedding, providing the premise to study theactivation of this pathway by blood in the joint in vivo. For this, we turned to hemophilic FVIII-deficient mice (F8-/- mice), which develop a hemarthrosisfollowing needle puncture injury with synovial inflammation and significantosteopenia adjacent to the affected joint. We found that needle puncture-induced bleeding leads to increased TNFα levels in the affected joint of F8-/- mice.Moreover, inactivation of TNFα or iRhom2 in F8-/- mice reduced the osteopenia andsynovial inflammation that develops in this mouse model for HA. Taken together,our results suggest that blood entering the joint activates theiRhom2/ADAM17/TNFα pathway, thereby contributing to osteopenia and synovitis inmice. Therefore, this pro-inflammatory signaling pathway could emerge as anattractive new target to prevent osteoporosis and joint damage in HA patients.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Hematology.DOI: 10.1182/blood-2017-12-820571 PMID: 29776906
