These biogenic metal nanoparticles are non-toxic and can be used as contrastagents, drug delivery vehicles and photothermal agents for cancer therapy.Herein, we report the synthesis of both silver and gold nanoparticles using thepollen extract of Phoenix dactylifera (Date Palm), characterization usingUV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-rayspectroscopy, quantitation of phytochemicals capping the nanoparticles usingFolin - Ciocalteu's method, cytotoxicity studies on MCF-7 breast cancer cells,cancer cell death analysis using fluorescent microscopy, and modulation ofexpression of the pro-apoptotic p53 and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Thebiosynthesis resulted in stable and poly-dispersed silver nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles, exhibiting strong and broad surface plasmon absorption peaks. The elemental analysis confirmed the presence of gold and silver of high purity andalso the organic moieties from the plant extract acting as capping andstabilizing agents. The biogenic nanoparticles also exhibited dose-dependentcytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells and showed signs of apoptotic cell death.Immunoassays revealed the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein p53 anddown-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 after the nanoparticletreatment.DOI: 10.1007/s12011-018-1287-0 PMID: 29552710
