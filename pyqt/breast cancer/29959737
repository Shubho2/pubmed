Developing abreast cancer is a multi-factorial and hormonal-dependent process, which may betriggered by many risk factors. An endocrine disrupting substance known asbisphenol A (BPA), that is used greatly in the manufacture of plastic products,was suggested as a possible risk factor for developing breast cancer. BPA has astrong binding affinity to non-classical membrane estrogen receptors likeestrogen-related and G protein-coupled (GPER) receptors. Based on animal and invitro studies, results showed a link between BPA exposure and increased incidenceof breast cancer. BPA has the ability to alter multiple molecular pathways incells namely, G protein-coupled receptor (GPER) pathway, estrogen-relatedreceptor gamma (ERRÎ³) pathway, HOXB9 (homeobox-containing gene) pathway, bonemorphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and (BMP4), immunoregulatory cytokine disturbance in the mammary gland, EGFR-STAT3 pathway, FOXA1 in ER-breast cancer cells,enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and epigenetic changes. Thus, theaforementioned alterations cause undesired gene stimulation or repression thatincrease risk of developing breast cancer. So, restricting exposure to BPA shouldbe considered to aid in lowering the risk of developing breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s11356-018-2540-y PMID: 29959737
