Thepurpose of this study was to assess the influence of several individualcharacteristics including clinico-pathological, lifestyle and genetic factors on overall survival (OS) of a relatively large and well characterizedpopulation-based series of 166 MBCs enrolled in Tuscany.METHODS: We genotyped MBC cases at BRCA1/2 genes and at 9 candidate BCsusceptibility SNPs. Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression,adjusted for several individual characteristics were used. To reduce a possibleselection bias related to the interval between diagnosis and enrolment of MBCcases into the study, we used the date of blood donation as the date of the startof observation for survival analysis.RESULTS: Only smoking habits had a significant effect on OS at 10 years (forcurrent smokers, HR: 3.34; 95% CI 1.45-7.68; p = 0.004), while lymph node status fell short of reaching statistical significance (for pN positive, HR: 2.07; 95%CI 0.93-4.55; p = 0.07). In the same multivariate analysis we found asignificantly higher OS in cases with FGFR2 rs2981582 variant in the dominanttransmission model (HR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.13-0.62; p = 0.028). A sensitivityanalysis with left truncation showed similar results.CONCLUSIONS: Our results may contribute to shed light on factors influencing MBC survival suggesting an important role for cigarette smoking and FGFR2 rs2981582variant, and provide clues for better patient management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
