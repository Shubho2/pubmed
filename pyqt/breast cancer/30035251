We evaluated the association of metabolic,inflammatory, and tumor markers with CTCs in women with metastatic BC beforecommencing a new systemic therapy.Methods: Ninety-six patients with newly diagnosed or progressing metastatic BCwithout current diabetes or use of anti-inflammatory agents were recruited fromfour Ontario hospitals. Women provided fasting blood for measurement ofmetabolic, inflammatory, and tumor markers and CTCs. CTCs were assayed within 72 hours of collection using CellSearch. Other blood was frozen at -80°C, and assayswere performed in a single batch. Associations between CTC counts with studyfactors were evaluated using Spearman correlation, and the chi-square or Fisherexact test. All statistical tests were two-sided and P value ≤ .05 was consideredstatistically significant.Results: The median age was 60.5 years; 90.6% were postmenopausal. The cohortincluded hormone receptor-positive (87.5%), HER2-positive (15.6%), andtriple-negative (10.4%) BCs. Patients were starting firstline (35.5%),second-line (26.0%), or third-or-later-line therapy (38.5%). CTC counts (per 7.5 mL of blood) ranged from 0 to 1238 (median 2); an elevated CTC count, defined as five or more CTCs, was detected in 42 (43.8%) patients. Those with livermetastases (vs not) more frequently had an elevated CTC count (59.0% vs 33.3%, P = .02). CTCs were significantly associated with C-reactive protein (R = .22, P = .02), interleukin (IL)-6 (R = .25, P = .01), IL-8 (R = .38, P = .0001),plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (R = .31, P = .001), carcinoembryonic antigen(R = .31, P = .002), and cancer antigen 15-3 (R = .40, P = .0001) and inverselyassociated with body mass index (R = -.23, P = .02) and leptin (R = -.26, P =.01).Conclusions: CTC counts were positively associated with tumor and inflammatorymarkers and inversely associated with some metabolic markers, potentiallyreflecting tumor burden and cachexia.DOI: 10.1093/jncics/pky028 PMCID: PMC6044231PMID: 30035251
