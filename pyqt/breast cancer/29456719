China.A number of previous studies have indicated the presence of a link betweenestrogen receptor-α (ERα) methylation and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).However, the association between ERα methylation and drug resistance during thetreatment of TNBC remains unclear. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reactionwas used to investigate the methylation of ERα in the genomic DNA of 35 patients with TNBC who were defined as cisplatin-based chemotherapy-resistant usingchemosensitivity testing. Survival probabilities by covariates were assessedusing Kaplan-Meier estimator survival analysis and Cox's proportional hazardsmodels, adjusting for age, menopausal status, tumor size, lymph node metastasisand ERα promoter DNA methylation. Of the 35 patients with TNBC analyzed, 8exhibited ERα promoter DNA methylation. Cisplatin resistance was confirmed to be overwhelmingly associated with ERα methylation by univariate and multivariateanalysis. Even in a limited analysis in patients with ERα methylation, theresults generated from methylated tumor tissue and unmethylated tumor tissuerevealed that expression of breast cancer type 1/2 susceptibility proteins wasincreased in ERα-methylated breast tumor tissue compared with in unmethylatedtissue. The ERα methylation group tended to have significantly shorterprogression-free (P=0.010) and overall (P=0.023) survival times compared withthose in the unmethylated group. Similarly, shorter progression-free (P=0.024)and overall (P=0.018) survival times were observed in the cisplatin-resistantgroup compared with the cisplatin-non-resistant group. ERα methylation predicts apoor clinical outcome for patients with TNBC. The results of the present studyindicated that ERα methylation may be a candidate surrogate biomarker for outcomeprediction and cisplatin resistance in TNBC. Further investigation is required toidentify potential biomarkers in a larger cohort in a prospective study.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7637 PMCID: PMC5778783PMID: 29456719
