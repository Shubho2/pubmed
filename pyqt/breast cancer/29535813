Davis JewishGeneral Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can remodel the extracellular matrix topromote cancer cell invasion, but the paracrine signaling between CAFs and cancercells that regulates tumor cell migration remains to be identified. To determine how the interaction between CAFs and cancer cells modulates the invasiveness ofcancer cells, we developed a 3-dimensional co-culture model composed of breastcancer (BC) MDA-MB-231 cell spheroids embedded in a collagen gel with and withoutCAFs. We found that the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells promotes invasionby stimulating the scattering of MDA-MB-231 cells, which was dependent onRhoA/ROCK/phospho MLC signaling in cancer cells but independent of RhoA in CAFs. The activation of RhoA/ROCK in cancer cells activates MLC and increasesmigration, while the genetic-down-regulation of RhoA and pharmacologicalinhibition of ROCK reduced cell scattering and invasion. Two distinct mechanisms induced the activation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells, thesecretion of IGF-1 by CAFs and the upregulation of PAI-1 in cancer cells. In anorthotopic model of BC, IGF-1R inhibition decreased the incidence of lungmetastasis, while Y27632-inhibition of ROCK enhanced the lung metastasis burden, which was associated with an increased recruitment of CAFs and expression ofPAI-1. Thus the crosstalk between CAFs and BC cells increases the secretion ofIGF-1 in CAFs and PAI-1 activity in cancer cells. Both IGF1 and PAI-1 activateRhoA/ROCK signaling in cancer cells, which increases cell scattering andinvasion.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23735 PMCID: PMC5828213PMID: 29535813
