We prospectively evaluated demographic and laboratory data in a cohort of 61 woman with breast cancer prior to paclitaxel exposure toexplore factors that predispose to neuropathy development. Neuropathy was graded based on the total neuropathy score reduced version (rTNS) at baseline and at 4months after initiation of chemotherapy. A multivariate analysis identifiedpredictors with the strongest association with a change in rTNS. Serum albumin (P= .002), paclitaxel dose (P = .001), and body surface area (P = .006) werestatistically significantly associated with a positive rTNS change (worseningneuropathy). These results suggest that poor nutritional status and obesityincrease the risk of paclitaxel induced neuropathy, and that screening for these factors prior to chemotherapy exposure may improve early neuropathy detection or decrease risk with dietary modifications.Â© 2018 Peripheral Nerve Society.DOI: 10.1111/jns.12271 PMID: 29696771
