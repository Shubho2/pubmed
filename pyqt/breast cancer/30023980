In breast cancer patients, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio can be used as an important prognostic indicator of survival. In routinelaboratory tests, the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio can also be examined inaddition to neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Although the effects on breast cancersurvival of platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, which is accepted as the twin ofneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, are not as widely accepted as those ofneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet activation is known to be a feature ofcancer. Here, we present the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio andplatelet-to-lymphocyte ratio of a patient with locally advanced cancer of theleft breast who underwent a simple mastectomy that reduced the tumor load.Following surgical therapy, a remarkable regression was observed in the localrecurrence area of the right mastectomy site; at the same time, the patient'sneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and PLR values significantly decreased.DOI: 10.5152/UCD.2016.3214 PMCID: PMC6048647PMID: 30023980
