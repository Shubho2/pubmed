Nevertheless, pharmacological data are still insufficient, and the roleof drug efflux transporters has not been fully elucidated. We therefore pursuedthe pharmacological characterization of this model, initially investigating theexpression of four well-known adenosine triphosphate [ATP]-binding cassette (ABC)transporters (P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance associated protein(MRP)1, MRP2, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)) by means of ELISA and immunofluorescence staining. The functional activity of the selected transporterswas assessed by accumulation studies based on specific substrates and inhibitors.We then performed standardized bidirectional transport experiments underair-liquid interface (ALI) culture conditions, using four therapeutic compoundsof local intranasal relevance in upper airway diseases. Protein expression ofP-gp, MRP1, MRP2, and BCRP was detected at the membrane of the RPMI 2650 cells.In addition, all four transporters exhibited functional activity at the cellular level. In the bidirectional transport experiments, the RPMI 2650 model was ableto accurately discriminate the four therapeutic compounds according to theirphysicochemical properties. The ABC transporters tested did not play a major rolein the efflux of these compounds at the barrier level. In conclusion, the RPMI2650 model represents a promising tool for assessing the nasal absorption ofdrugs on the basis of preclinical pharmacological data.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00087 PMID: 29709196
