Wehypothesized that the immunological responses to p53MVA vaccine may requireadditional immune checkpoint blockade to achieve clinically beneficial levels. Wetherefore conducted a phase I trial evaluating the combination of p53MVA andpembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in patients with advanced solid tumors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with advanced breast, pancreatic,hepatocellular, or head and neck cancer received up to 3 triweekly vaccines incombination with pembrolizumab given concurrently and thereafter, alone at 3-weekintervals until disease progression. The patients were assessed for toxicity and clinical response. Correlative studies analyzed p53-reactive T cells and profile of immune function gene expression.RESULTS: We observed clinical responses in 3/11 patients who remained with stabledisease for 30, 32, and 49Â weeks. Two of these patients showed increasedfrequencies and persistence of p53-reactive CD8+ T cells and elevation ofexpression of multiple immune response genes. Borderline or undetectablep53-specific T cell responses in 7/11 patients were related to no immediateclinical benefit. The first study patient had a grade 5 fatal myocarditis. After the study was amended for enhanced cardiac monitoring, no additional cardiactoxicities were noted.CONCLUSION: We have shown that the combination of p53MVA vaccine withpembrolizumab is feasible, safe, and may offer clinical benefit in select groupof patients that should be identified through further studies.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1932-2 PMID: 30094792
