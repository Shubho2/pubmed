This study testedwhether alternative descriptive labels may be more appropriate.DESIGN: Questionnaire preceded by a description of overdiagnosis.SETTING: Home-based, computer-assisted face-to-face survey.PARTICIPANTS: 2111 adults aged 18-70 years in England recruited using randomlocation sampling by a survey company. Data from 1888 participants were analysed after exclusions due to missing data.INTERVENTIONS: Participants were given one of two pieces of text describingoverdiagnosis, allocated at random, adapted from National Health Service breastand prostate cancer screening leaflets.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcomes were which of severalavailable terms (eg, 'overdetection') participants had previously encountered andwhich they endorsed as applicable labels for the concept described. Demographics and previous exposure to screening information were also measured. Main outcomes were summarised with descriptive statistics. Predictors of previouslyencountering at least one term, or endorsing at least one as making sense, wereassessed using binary logistic regression.RESULTS: 58.0% of participants had not encountered any suggested term; 44.0% did not endorse any as applicable labels. No term was notably familiar; theproportion of participants who had previously encountered each term ranged from15.9% to 28.3%. Each term was only endorsed as applicable by a minority (range:27.6% to 40.4%). Notable predictors of familiarity included education, age andethnicity; participants were less likely to have encountered terms if they wereolder, not white British or had less education. Findings were similar for bothpieces of information.CONCLUSIONS: Familiarity with suggested terms for overdiagnosis and levels ofendorsement were low, and no clear alternative labels for the concept wereidentified, suggesting that changing terminology alone would do little to improveunderstanding, particularly for some population groups. Explicit descriptions maybe more effective.Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018. All rights reserved.
