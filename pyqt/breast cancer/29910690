The IGF-I/II actions are mediated through the IGF receptor type 1(IGF-1R) and the insulin receptor (IR), which are overexpressed in multiple typesof tumors. Here, we have firstly identified a human engineered antibody domain(eAd) from a phage-displayed VH library. The eAd suppressed the signaltransduction of IGF-1R mediated by exogenous IGF-I or IGF-II in breast cancercell lines through neutralizing both IGF-I and IGF-II. It also significantlyinhibited the growth of breast cancer cells. Therefore, the anti-IGF-I/II eAdoffers an alternative approach to target both the IGF-1R signaling pathwaysthrough the inhibition of IGF-I/II.DOI: 10.7150/ijbs.25928 PMCID: PMC6001679PMID: 29910690
