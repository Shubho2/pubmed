Cancer has already caused severe economic burdens on society,especially in developing countries and has become a major public health concern. This study evaluates the medical economic burden, including total currentcurative expenditure (CCE) and catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) on cancer inLiaoning Province, China. A total of 252 medical institutions were investigatedwith multistage stratified cluster random sampling. We established a standardizeddatabase of 3 532 517 samples. "System of Health Account 2011", a newinternationally recognized accounting system, was established to analyze the CCE on six most common cancers. CHE were estimated from the extracted 1344 patientswith cancer, which performed a cross-sectional study. The association ofindividual and contextual factors with CHE was evaluated using logisticregression models. CCE for all the patients with the six types of cancer was2801.38 million CNY in Liaoning Province, the highest of which was lung cancer.The incidence of CHE was 42.78%, while the threshold was 40%. The average andrelative distance were 10.41% and 24.32%, respectively. Influencing factors were length of stay, type of health insurance, location of household, etc. Ourfindings highlight the need to address medical economic burden in the cancerpopulation. Households with the cancer are more likely to incur CHE. Financialintervention to prevent it should target on poor households. We providesuggestions in aspects of health insurance and health service management toreduce CHE.© 2018 The Authors.
