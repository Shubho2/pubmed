Lysosomal sorting is mediated byinteraction of ubiquitylated transmembrane proteins with the endosomal sortingcomplex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. In this study, we uncover analternative role for the ESCRT-0 component hepatocyte growth factor-regulatedtyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) in promoting the constitutive recycling oftransmembrane proteins. We find that endosomal localization of the actinnucleating factor Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue (WASH)requires HRS, which occupies adjacent endosomal subdomains. Depletion of HRSresults in defective constitutive recycling of epidermal growth factor receptorand the matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP, leading to their accumulation ininternal compartments. We show that direct interactions with endosomal actin are required for efficient recycling and use a model system of chimeric transferrinreceptor trafficking to show that an actin-binding motif can counteract anubiquitin signal for lysosomal sorting. Directed receptor recycling is used bycancer cells to achieve invasive migration. Accordingly, abrogating HRS- andactin-dependent MT1-MMP recycling results in defective matrix degradation andinvasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells.© 2018 MacDonald et al.DOI: 10.1083/jcb.201710051 PMCID: PMC6028553PMID: 29891722
