However, noeffective therapeutic options currently exist for cancer patients withmetastasis. Estrogen receptor β (ERβ), as a member of the nuclear receptorsuperfamily, shows potent tumor-suppressive activities in many cancers. Toinvestigate whether modulation of ERβ could serve as a therapeutic strategy forcancer metastasis, we examined whether the selective ERβ agonist LY500307 couldsuppress lung metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and melanoma.Mechanistically, while we observed that LY500307 potently induced cell death ofcancer cells metastasized to lung in vivo, it does not mediate apoptosis ofcancer cells in vitro, indicating that the cell death-inducing effects ofLY500307 might be mediated by the tumor microenvironment. Pathologicalexamination combined with flow cytometry assays indicated that LY500307 treatmentinduced significant infiltration of neutrophils in the metastatic niche.Functional experiments demonstrated that LY500307-treated cancer cells showchemotactic effects for neutrophils and that in vivo neutrophil depletion by Ly6Gantibody administration could reverse the effects of LY500307-mediated metastasissuppression. RNA sequencing analysis showed that LY500307 could induceup-regulation of IL-1β in TNBC and melanoma cells, which further triggeredantitumor neutrophil chemotaxis. However, the therapeutic effects of LY500307treatment for suppression of lung metastasis was attenuated in IL1B-/- murinemodels, due to failure to induce antitumor neutrophil infiltration in themetastatic niche. Collectively, our study demonstrated that pharmacologicalactivation of ERβ could augment innate immunity to suppress cancer metastaticcolonization to lung, thus providing alternative therapeutic options for cancerpatients with metastasis.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1803291115 PMCID: PMC5910874 [Available on 2018-10-17]PMID: 29592953
