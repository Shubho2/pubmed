[Epub ahead of print]Cholesterol and vitamin E-conjugated PEGylated polymeric micelles for efficientdelivery and enhanced anticancer activity of curcumin: evaluation in 2Dmonolayers and 3D spheroids.Muddineti OS(1), Vanaparthi A(1), Rompicharla SVK(1), Kumari P(1), Ghosh B(1),Biswas S(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Pharmacy , Birla Institute of Technology & Science-Pilani,Hyderabad Campus , Hyderabad , India.A newly synthesized PEGylated cholesterol/α-tocopheryl succinate (α-TOS) linkedpolymer (CV) was self-assembled and loaded with curcumin to form a micellarsystem (C-CVM). The tri-functionalized amphiphilic polymer was constituted ofhydrophobic cholesterol and α-TOS connected to hydrophilic PEG via a lysinelinker. The synthesized polymer and the micelles were characterized by 1H NMR,DLS, zeta potentiometer, TEM, CMC determination and hemolysis studies. CVMdisplayed low CMC value of 15 µM with extent of hemolysis as less than 4%. Thestable C-CVM with optimum % drug loading (14.2 ± 0.24) displayed Z average of175.8 ± 0.68 nm with PDI (0.248 ± 0.075) and released curcumin in sustainedmanner in the in vitro drug release study. C-CVM demonstrated dose-dependentcellular uptake and cytotoxicity in murine melanoma, B16F10 and human breastcancer, MDA-MB-231 cell lines. CV exhibited marked reversal of drug resistance asindicated by significantly higher retention of P-glycoprotein substrate,rhodamine-123 in the resistant B16F10 cell line compared to standardP-glycoprotein inhibitor, verapamil. C-CVM demonstrated significantly higherspheroidal growth inhibition compared to C-PPM. The results provide strongevidence for CVM as promising drug delivery system and confirm the potential ofC-CVM as chemotherapy in cancer.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1435551 PMID: 29426248
