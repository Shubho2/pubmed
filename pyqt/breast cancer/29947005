[Epub ahead ofprint]Management of In-Breast Tumor Recurrence.Wong SM(1), Golshan M(2).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.(2)Department of Surgery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women'sHospital, Boston, MA, USA. mgolshan@partners.org.The management of isolated in-breast tumor recurrence is complex, requiringcareful consideration of prior local therapies to plan future multimodalitytreatment. Options for surgical management have evolved from standard salvagemastectomy with axillary clearance and now include repeat breast conservationwith axillary staging in select patients. Reattempting sentinel lymph node biopsymay avoid the morbidity of extensive axillary surgery and has been shown to befeasible in clinically node-negative patients with oncologically safe outcomes.In the adjuvant setting, partial breast irradiation has emerged as a valuablemeans to improve local control rates with limited associated toxicity andacceptable overall cosmesis. Furthermore, results from prospective trials are nowavailable to support the use of chemotherapy in hormone-receptor negativesubgroups, which is associated with improvements in long-term, disease-free, and overall survival.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6605-4 PMID: 29947005
