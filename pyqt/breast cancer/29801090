Little is known about uptake or outcomes of multiple-genesequencing after breast cancer diagnosis in community practice.Objective: To examine the effect of multiple-gene sequencing on the experienceand treatment outcomes for patients with breast cancer.Design, Setting, and Participants: For this population-based retrospective cohortstudy, patients with breast cancer diagnosed from January 2013 to December 2015and accrued from SEER registries across Georgia and in Los Angeles, California,were surveyed (n = 5080, response rate = 70%). Responses were merged with SEERdata and results of clinical genetic tests, either BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2)sequencing only or including additional other genes (multiple-gene sequencing),provided by 4 laboratories.Main Outcomes and Measures: Type of testing (multiple-gene sequencing vsBRCA1/2-only sequencing), test results (negative, variant of unknownsignificance, or pathogenic variant), patient experiences with testing (timing oftesting, who discussed results), and treatment (strength of patient considerationof, and surgeon recommendation for, prophylactic mastectomy), and prophylacticmastectomy receipt. We defined a patient subgroup with higher pretest risk ofcarrying a pathogenic variant according to practice guidelines.Results: Among 5026 patients (mean [SD] age, 59.9 [10.7]), 1316 (26.2%) werelinked to genetic results from any laboratory. Multiple-gene sequencingincreasingly replaced BRCA1/2-only testing over time: in 2013, the rate ofmultiple-gene sequencing was 25.6% and BRCA1/2-only testing, 74.4%;in 2015 therate of multiple-gene sequencing was 66.5% and BRCA1/2-only testing, 33.5%.Multiple-gene sequencing was more often ordered by genetic counselors(multiple-gene sequencing, 25.5% and BRCA1/2-only testing, 15.3%) and delayeduntil after surgery (multiple-gene sequencing, 32.5% and BRCA1/2-only testing,19.9%). Multiple-gene sequencing substantially increased rate of detection of anypathogenic variant (multiple-gene sequencing: higher-risk patients, 12%;average-risk patients, 4.2% and BRCA1/2-only testing: higher-risk patients, 7.8%;average-risk patients, 2.2%) and variants of uncertain significance, especiallyin minorities (multiple-gene sequencing: white patients, 23.7%; black patients,44.5%; and Asian patients, 50.9% and BRCA1/2-only testing: white patients, 2.2%; black patients, 5.6%; and Asian patients, 0%). Multiple-gene sequencing was notassociated with an increase in the rate of prophylactic mastectomy use, which washighest with pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 (BRCA1/2, 79.0%; other pathogenicvariant, 37.6%; variant of uncertain significance, 30.2%; negative, 35.3%).Conclusions and Relevance: Multiple-gene sequencing rapidly replaced BRCA1/2-onlytesting for patients with breast cancer in the community and enabled 2-foldhigher detection of clinically relevant pathogenic variants without an associatedincrease in prophylactic mastectomy. However, important targets for improvementin the clinical utility of multiple-gene sequencing include postsurgical delayand racial/ethnic disparity in variants of uncertain significance.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.0644 PMID: 29801090
