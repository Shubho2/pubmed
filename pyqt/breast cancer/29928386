China.The aim of the study was to investigate possible effects of p57 on the growth of the human MCF-7 and rat SHZ-88 breast cancer cell lines. Specific oligonucleotidesequences containing small hairpin structure were inserted into a smallinterfering RNA (siRNA) expression vector. The human MCF-7 and rat SHZ-88 breast cancer cell lines were transfected with recombinant plasmids. The p57 geneexpression was blocked in the human MCF-7 breast and rat SHZ-88 breast cancercells, using chemically modified siRNA. The p57 expression level was evaluatedusing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis.Immunofluorescence was conducted to detect p57 expression in the breast cancercells. Tetrazolium blue (MTT) method was employed to detect the effect of p57inhibition on the proliferation of the MCF-7 and SHZ-88 cell lines. Cellproliferation in the experimental group was significantly reduced.Immunofluorescence assay results showed p57 siRNA effectively inhibited the p57level in the MCF-7 and SHZ-88 cells. RT-PCR results showed that 48 h aftertransfection, the p57 mRNA level in the transfected group was significantly lowercompared with the control group. In conclusion, p57 effectively inhibited theproliferation of breast cancer after stable interference.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8605 PMCID: PMC6006381PMID: 29928386
