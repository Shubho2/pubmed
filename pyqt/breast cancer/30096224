[Epub ahead of print]Loading lovastatin into camptothecin-floxuridine conjugate nanocapsules forenhancing anti-metastatic efficacy of cocktail chemotherapy on triple-negativebreast cancer.Zhang N, Liang X, Gao C, Chen M, Zhou Y, Krueger CJ, Bao G, Gong Z, Dai Z.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a malignant and refractory disease withhigh morbidity and mortality. TNBC shows no response to hormonal therapy nortargeted therapy, due to the lack of known targetable biomarkers. Furthermore,TNBC also exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity that leads to cancer evolution,drug resistance, metastatic progression, and recurrence, arising from thetumor-initiating properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Thus, the development ofradical therapeutic regimens with high efficacy and limited side effects iscrucial. In this study, we designed an innovative ternary cocktail chemotherapyby using Lovastatin (L)-loaded Janus camptothecin-floxuridine conjugate (CF)nanocapsules (NCs) with ultrahigh drug loading capacity. The obtained LCF NCswere shown to be able to suppress growth of TNBC, including inhibition of growth and metastasis of CSCs, both in vitro and in tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, inanimal experiments, LCF NCs showed sustained and synchronous drug release(half-life >300 min), 85.2% reduction in pulmonary metastases, and no cancerrecurrence during one-month observation post-treatment. Thus, this innovative LCFNC design provide a simple and synergistic strategy for the development ofsimultaneous triple chemotherapy, and in the future could be an efficacious, safeand amenable choice with higher therapeutic relevance and fewer toxiccomplications than conventional multi-drug delivery systems for TNBC treatment inthe future.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b11723 PMID: 30096224
