The aim of this study was to prospectively andquantitatively asses myocardial blood flow (MBF) with, for the first time,15O-H2O PET/CT as a marker of heart damage in irradiated breast cancer patients.METHODS: 15 breast cancer patients receiving intact breast or chest wallirradiation were included in the analysis (six with right-sided and nine withleft-sided breast cancer). They underwent 15O-H2O PET/CT before radiotherapy (RT)and 2 and 8 months after RT. MBF was quantitatively assessed at rest and understress conditions in 17 heart segments distinguished according to the AmericanUltrasound Association classification. Regional MBF values were derived in eachof the coronary artery territories.RESULTS: MBF decreased in 53% and increased in 33% of cases 2 months after RT in both left-sided and right-sided breast cancer patients. Stress testing was moresensitive than at-rest testing, demonstrating decreased perfusion in the segmentssupplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) [5.41 ± 1.74 vs4.52 ± 1.82 ml (g*min)-1; p = 0.018], which persisted at 6 months [5.41 ± 1.74 vs4.40 ± 1.38 ml (g*min)-1; p = 0.032] and a decrease in global heart perfusion[5.14 ± 1.49 vs 4.46 ± 1.73 ml (g*min)-1; p = 0.036]. A minimal radiation doseapplied to the LAD correlated with MBF changes observed 2 months after RT (r =-0.57; p = 0.032). Radiological findings were not correlated with clinicalsymptoms of heart toxicity.CONCLUSION: 15O-H2O PET/CT is safe and effective for the early detection andquantitative analysis of subclinical post-RT changes in heart perfusion in breastcancer patients. The LV segments supplied by the LAD are the main site of MBFchanges. A minimum radiation dose deposited in the LAD may be a predictor ofradiation-induced heart toxicity. Advances in knowledge: This is the first timethat 15O-H2O PET/CT has been used to assess MBF after RT and the first granulardescription of the distribution of blood flow changes after breast cancer RT.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170653 PMID: 29470136  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
