In age group <40, theRR ranges from 1.71 in Houston to 5.37 in Washington, DC. For age group 50-64,the disparity was less pronounced, ranging from 1.24 in New York to 1.72 inChicago. For 65+ age group, there was wide city to city variation in breastcancer mortality disparity. Three cities had higher mortality for NHW compared toNHB; Baltimore 0.78, Washington DC 0.94 and New York 0.98. One city had nostatistically significant racial variation in breast cancer mortality in this agegroup and six cities had increased NHB: NHW mortality disparities.CONCLUSIONS: While the mortality rate for breast cancer is lower among youngerwomen, the NHB:NHW disparities, as measured by rate ratios, are most pronouncedin these age groups. Given the absence of available data regarding incidence,stage and subtypes, further research is necessary and such research is important,given the possible policy implications of these results with respect to screeningguidelines and coverage for mammography and breast cancer treatment in particularfor younger NHB women.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
