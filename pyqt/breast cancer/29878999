A decrease in the odds of fat necrosis was seen withlateral row (OR .29, p-value=. 001) and both-row perforator flaps (OR .21,p-value=. 001), if ICG angiography was utilized (OR .46, p-value=. 04), and with increasing total flow rate of the flap (OR .62 per 1 mm/s increase, p-value=.05).Increased odds of abdominal bulge or hernia were seen with lateral or bothrow perforators (OR 3.21, p-value=. 05) vs. medial row perforator based flaps,and with patients whom had an abdominal wound post-operatively (OR 2.59,p-value=. 05).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that utilizing larger caliber perforators andperforators from the lateral row alone, or in addition to medial row perforators,can decrease fat necrosis rather than by simply harvesting more perforatorsalone. However, lateral and both row perforator flaps come at the cost ofincreasing abdominal bulge rates.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004631 PMID: 29878999
