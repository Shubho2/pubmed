This study aimed to investigate complications, patient-reported pain,health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and satisfaction following reconstructive surgery at Oslo University Hospital between 2006 and 2013.METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from the records of 238 patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect patient-reported HRQoL andsatisfaction with outcome using the Short Form-12 questionnaires and Breast-Q.The self-administered Leeds assessment of neuropathic symptoms and signs was usedto assess neuropathic pain.RESULTS: The majority of participants (89.5%) underwent implant-based breastreconstruction (IBBR); the remainder underwent autologous-tissue breastreconstruction (ATBR). Overall, 28.6% had complications within 30 days of surgeryand 14.6% required resurgery because of complications. Women who underwent IBBRhad a later onset of complications than those undergoing ATBR. Participants inthe survey (n = 175 of 219, response rate 79.9%) reported similar HRQoL to anage-matched general female population. Few (2.9%) reported neuropathic pain.Patients who underwent IBBR were significantly less satisfied with thereconstructed breast (p = .001) and overall outcome (p = .02) than those whounderwent ATBR, but there were no significant differences in HRQoL scores betweenthe two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 28.6% of the women had complications within 30 days and14.6% needed resurgery. Few had neuropathic pain. Women who underwent ATBR weremore satisfied with the overall outcome than those who underwent IBBR.DOI: 10.1080/2000656X.2018.1470093 PMID: 29741462
