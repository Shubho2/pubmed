We used data fromNational Cancer Database (NCDB) to validate and improve the PSG.METHODS: All patients had surgery and at least some systemic treatment (endocrinetherapy, chemotherapy or HER2 targeted therapy). Information from 420,520patients was assessed for potential predictors of overall survival (OS),including age at diagnosis (age), tumor grade (G), hormonal receptor and HER2status, and presence of lymph vascular invasion (LVI), stratified by stage orsub-stages. Based on the multivariate Cox analyses, we built different pointsystems to predict OS and evaluated the different point systems by Akaike'sinformation criterion (AIC), Harrell's concordance index (C-index), and Uno'sconcordance index.RESULTS: Age, G, hormonal receptor and HER2 status, LVI and being TNBC weresignificantly associated with OS (all P < 0.0001). Three staging systems werecorrelated with OS: system 1 was the conventional anatomic TNM staging; system 2 included TNM, age, G, hormonal receptor, HER2, and LVI; system 3 included TNM,age, G, TNBC versus non-TNBC, and LVI. System 3 (C-index; 0.7316; AIC: 488138.91)achieved the best balance between predictive performance and goodness-of-fit tothe NCDB data as compared to system 2 (C-index: 0.7325; AIC: 498087.73) andsystem 1 (C-index: 0.716; AIC: 688536.49).CONCLUSIONS: The new PSG is a better staging system than the conventionalanatomic TNM system. Grouping breast cancer into TNBC versus non-TNBC may besimpler while retaining similar accuracy as using ER/PR/HER2 status to predictOS.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4832-9 PMID: 29948405
