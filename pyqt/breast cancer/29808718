The pathophysiologicalrelationships between diabetes and cancer are not fully understood, andpersonalized treatments for diabetes-associated BC are urgently needed.RESULTS: We observed that high glucose (HG), via activation of nuclearphosphatase PP2Cδ, suppresses p53 function, and consequently promotes BC cellproliferation, migration, and invasion. PP2Cδ expression is higher in tumortissues from BC patients with hyperglycemia than those with normoglycemia. Themechanisms underlying HG stimulation of PP2Cδ involve classical/novel proteinkinase-C (PKC) activation and GSK3β phosphorylation. Reactive oxygen species(ROS)/NF-κB pathway also mediates HG induction of PP2Cδ. Furthermore, weidentified a 1,5-diheteroarylpenta-1,4-dien-3-one (Compound 23, or C23) as anovel potent PP2Cδ inhibitor with a striking cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells through cell-based screening assay for growth inhibition and activity of a group ofcurcumin mimics. Beside directly inhibiting PP2Cδ activity, C23 blocks HGinduction of PP2Cδ expression via heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) induction andsubsequent ablation of ROS/NF-κB activation. C23 can thus significantly blockHG-triggered inhibition of p53 activity, leading to the inhibition of cancer cellproliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, hyperglycemia promotes BCdevelopment in diabetic nude mice, and C23 inhibits the xenografted BC tumorgrowth. Conclusions and Innovation: Our findings elucidate mechanisms that mayhave contributed to diabetes-associated BC progression, and provide the firstevidence to support the possible alternative therapeutic approach to BC patients with diabetes.
