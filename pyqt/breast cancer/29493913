117. Cancer, Breast.Alkabban FM, Ferguson T(1).In: StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2018-.2018 Feb 7.Author information: (1)Michigan State UniversityBreast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women, accounting for morethan 1 in 10 new cancer diagnoses each year. It is the second most common causeof death from cancer among women in the world. Anatomically, the breast hasmilk-producing glands in front the chest wall. They lie on the pectoralis majormuscle, and there are ligaments support the breast and attach it to the chestwall. Fifteen to 20 lobes circularly arranged to form the breast. The fat thatcovers the lobes determines the breast size and shape. Each lobe is formed bylobules that contain the glands that are responsible for milk production inresponse to hormone stimulation. Breast cancer always evolves silently. Most ofthe patients discover their disease during their routine screening. Others arepresented with an accidentally discovered breast lump, change of breast shape or size, or nipple discharge. However, mastalgia is not uncommon. Physicalexamination, imaging especially mammography, and tissue biopsy must be done todiagnose breast cancer. The survival rate improves with early diagnosis. Thetumor tends to spread lymphatically and hematologically leading to distantmetastasis and poor prognosis. This explains and emphasizes the importance ofbreast cancer screening programs.PMID: 29493913
