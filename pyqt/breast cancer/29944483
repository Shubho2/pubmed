Ultrafast dynamiccontrast-enhanced breast MRI can be acquired within 2 minutes. We aimed to assesswhether screening performance of breast radiologist using an ultrafast breastMRI-only screening protocol is as good as performance using a fullmultiparametric diagnostic MRI protocol (FDP).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this study, andwaived the need for informed consent. Between January 2012 and June 2014, 1791consecutive breast cancer screening examinations from 954 women with a lifetimerisk of more than 20% were prospectively collected. All women were scanned using a 3 T protocol interleaving ultrafast breast MRI acquisitions in a fullmultiparametric diagnostic MRI protocol consisting of standard dynamiccontrast-enhanced sequences, diffusion-weighted imaging, and T2-weighted imaging.Subsequently, a case set was created including all biopsied screen-detectedlesions in this period (31 malignant and 54 benign) and 116 randomly selectednormal cases with more than 2 years of follow-up. Prior examinations wereincluded when available. Seven dedicated breast radiologists read all 201examinations and 153 available priors once using the FDP and once using ultrafastbreast MRI only in 2 counterbalanced and crossed-over reading sessions.RESULTS: For reading the FDP versus ultrafast breast MRI alone, sensitivity was0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.90) versus 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78-0.88) (P= 0.50), specificity was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.74-0.79) versus 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79-0.84)(P = 0.002), positive predictive value was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.36-0.45) versus 0.45(95% CI, 0.41-0.50) (P = 0.14), and area under the receiver operatingcharacteristics curve was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.96) versus 0.89 (95% CI,0.82-0.96) (P = 0.83). Ultrafast breast MRI reading was 22.8% faster than readingFDP (P < 0.001). Interreader agreement is significantly better for ultrafastbreast MRI (κ = 0.730; 95% CI, 0.699-0.761) than for the FDP (κ = 0.665; 95% CI, 0.633-0.696).CONCLUSIONS: Breast MRI screening using only an ultrafast breast MRI protocol is noninferior to screening with an FDP and may result in significantly higherscreening specificity and shorter reading time.DOI: 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000494 PMID: 29944483
