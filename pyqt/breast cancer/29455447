Three-state continuous time Markov models were used toestimate transition rates and transition rate ratios (TRRs) by TRICARE benefittype (Prime or non-Prime) and care source (direct, purchased, or both), adjusted for demographic, tumor, and treatment variables.RESULTS: Analyses included 2668 women with transitions from diagnosis torecurrence (n = 832), recurrence to death (n = 79), and diagnosis to deathwithout recurrence (n = 91). Compared to women with Prime within each caresource, women with non-Prime using both care sources had higher transition rates (TRR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03, 2.10). Compared to those using direct care within eachbenefit type, women utilizing both care sources with non-Prime had highertransition rates (TRR 1.86, 95% CI 1.11, 3.13), while women with Prime utilizing purchased care had lower transition rates (TRR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68, 0.98).CONCLUSIONS: In the MHS, women with non-Prime benefit plans compared to Prime hadhigher transition rates along the breast cancer continuum among both care source users. Purchased care users had lower transition rates than direct care usersamong Prime beneficiaries.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Benefit plan and care source may be associatedwith breast cancer progression. Further research is needed to demonstratedifferences in survivorship.DOI: 10.1007/s11764-018-0680-1 PMID: 29455447
