Palbociclib-based regimen was associatedwith significantly lower treatment discontinuation rates compared with the other approved drugs in this indication.CONCLUSION: In the absence of direct comparative evidence, the results of thisnetwork meta-analysis represent the best available evidence for decision makingin the first-line treatment of metastatic luminal breast cancer.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-0532 PMID: 29527939
