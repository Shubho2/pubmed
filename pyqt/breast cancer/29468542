As atumor suppressor protein, pRb is frequently dysregulated in several majorcancers. In addition to mutations, inactivation of pRb is also caused byepigenetic mechanisms including alterations of DNA methylation. There are threeCpG islands located within the RB1 gene that encodes pRb that are closelyassociated with the regulation of pRb expression. Aberrant DNA methylation at theRB1 gene has been reported in sporadic retinoblastoma as well as other cancersincluding glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer. Recentstudies have revealed that the RB1 gene is imprinted. Therefore, quantitativeanalysis is required to detect aberrations in DNA methylation associated withimprint deregulation. Pyrosequencing® is considered as the method of choice forquantitative and reproducible analysis of DNA methylation with single baseresolution. In this chapter, we provide a detailed protocol for the quantitative analysis of RB1 gene methylation using bisulfite Pyrosequencing®.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7565-5_5 PMID: 29468542
