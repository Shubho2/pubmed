Previous studies have shown that dysfunction of SEC was associated with multiple human cancers, such as leukemia and breast cancer. However, therole of SEC in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) development remains largely unknown. In this study, we found expression of AF4/FMR2 family member 4(AFF4), the core component of SEC, was upregulated dramatically in HNSCC celllines and tumor tissues. By using siRNA-mediated depletion and overexpression of AFF4, we demonstrated AFF4 promoted proliferation, migration and invasion ofHNSCC cells. Moreover, we found AFF4 enhanced the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)activity and sphere formatting activity and was required for the tumor-initiationcapacity of stem-like cells in HNSCC cell lines. Mechanistically, we found therole of AFF4 in regulation of HNSCC cell behaviors was mainly mediated bysex-determining region Y box2 (SOX2), a critical regulator involved indevelopment of several human cancers. SOX2 expression changed in parallel withAFF4 expression in response to depletion and overexpression of AFF4,respectively. More importantly, overexpression of SOX2 rescued the inhibitedproliferation, migration, invasion and ALDH activity induced by knockdown of AFF4in HNSCC cells, at least in part. Collectively, our findings indicate AFF4 mayserve as a biomarker and a potential target of therapies for patients with HNSCC.DOI: 10.1093/carcin/bgy046 PMCID: PMC6031063PMID: 29741610
