BYK1371, enabled the discovery of two new cyclicheptapeptides, depsidomycins B and C (1 and 2), each containing two piperazicacid units and a formyl group at their N-terminus. The structures of 1 and 2 wereelucidated by a combination of spectroscopic and chemical analyses. These newcompounds were determined to possess d-leucine, d-threonine, d-valine, andS-piperazic acid based on the advanced Marfey's method and a GITC(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-Î²-d-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate) derivatization oftheir hydrolysates, followed by LC/MS analysis. Depsidomycins B and C displayedsignificant antimetastatic activities against metastatic breast cancer cells(MDA-MB-231).DOI: 10.3390/molecules23061266 PMID: 29799492
