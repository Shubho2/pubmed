Electronic address: rkarimi@sci.ui.ac.ir.(2)Department of Chemistry, University of Isfahan, Isfahan 81746-73441, IslamicRepublic of Iran.A new strategy is developed for construction of the mixed molecularnanostructures from folic acid (FOA), a targeting agent, anddeferrioxamoine-Ga(III), (DFO-Ga(III)), a theranostic agent, ongold-mercaptopropionic acid surface, Au-MPA. The strategy is focused to achieve asystem in which all the active constituents of FOA; i.e., pteridine rings,p-aminobenzoeic acid, and the glutamic acid, having high affinity for folatereceptor overexpressed on cancer cells; remain unreacted in adjacent toDFO-Ga(III), Au-MPA-[DFO-Ga(III)]‖-[FOA]. For this purpose, the NH2 groups of FOAand DFO-Ga(III) were attached covalently and separately to COOH of Au-MPA surfaceallowing all the active groups of FOA to be available for drug delivery purposes.The data obtained through several electrochemical and surface analysistechniques, supported successful construction of the designed mixed molecularnanostructures system. In addition, the results showed that the system is stable,and Ga(III) ion does not leave DFO-Ga(III) complex. The prepared surface wassuccessfully tested for capturing of the breast cancer cells 4T1 as a model. The measurements showed a rapid uptake kinetics (t1/2 of ~6.0min) and efficientaccessibility of the system by the cancer cells; the Rct was significantlyincreased in the presence of 4T1 cells compared with blank PBS (ΔRct ~420kΩ).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
