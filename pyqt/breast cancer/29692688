The 18F-labeled estradiolderivative has been successfully used to clinically assess the ER level of breastcancer. In order to simplify the radiosynthesis process, one-step 18F-19F isotopeexchange reaction was employed for the 18F-fluorination of the tracer of[18F]AmBF3-TEG-ES. The radiotracer was obtained with the radiochemical yield(RCY) of ~61% and the radiochemical purity (RCP) of >98% within 40 min. Celluptake and blocking assays indicated that the tracer could selectively accumulatein the ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D. In vivo PETimaging on the MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice showed relatively high tumor uptake(1.4~2.3 %D/g) and tumor/muscle uptake ratio (4~6). These results indicated that the tracer is a promising PET imaging agent for ER-positive breast cancers.DOI: 10.1155/2018/5362329 PMCID: PMC5859795PMID: 29692688
