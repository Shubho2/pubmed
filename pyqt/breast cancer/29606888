Wild-type p53 tumor suppressor protein promotes cell-cyclearrest and apoptosis and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor-dependentangiogenesis, whereas mutant p53 protein (mtp53) lacks these functions, resultingin tumor cell survival and metastasis. Restoration of p53 function is therefore apromising drug-targeted strategy for combating mtp53-expressing breast cancer.Methods: In this study, we sought to determine whether administration of APR-246,a small-molecule drug that restores p53 function, in combination with 2aG4, anantibody that targets phosphatidylserine residues on tumor blood vessels anddisrupts tumor vasculature, effectively inhibits advanced hormone-dependentbreast cancer tumor growth.Results: APR-246 reduced cell viability in mtp53-expressing BT-474 and T47-Dhuman breast cancer cells in vitro, and significantly induced apoptosis in adose-dependent manner. However, APR-246 did not reduce cell viability in MCF-7breast cancer cells, which express wild-type p53. We next examined APR-246'santi-tumor effects in vivo using BT-474 and T47-D tumor xenografts established infemale nude mice. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with APR-246 and/or 2aG4 andtumor volume followed over time. Tumor growth was more effectively suppressed by combination treatment than by either agent alone, and combination therapycompletely eradicated some tumors. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tumor tissue sections demonstrated that combination therapy more effectively induced apoptosisand reduced cell proliferation in tumor xenografts than either agent alone.Importantly, combination therapy dramatically reduced the density of bloodvessels, which serve as the major route for tumor metastasis, in tumor xenograftscompared with either agent alone.Conclusion: Based on our findings, we contend that breast tumor growth mighteffectively be controlled by simultaneous targeting of mtp53 protein and tumorblood vessels in mtp53-expressing cancers.DOI: 10.2147/BCTT.S156285 PMCID: PMC5868596PMID: 29606888
