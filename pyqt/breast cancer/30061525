Recently, research hasshown that radiology images can be a potential tool for genotype prediction, and fusion of multi-modality data by deep learning methods can further providecomplementary information to enhance prediction accuracy. However, it still does not have an effective deep learning architecture to predict IDH genotype withthree-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images. In this paper, we proposed anovel multimodal 3D DenseNet (M3D-DenseNet) model to predict IDH genotypes withmultimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. To evaluate its performance, weconducted experiments on the BRATS-2017 and The Cancer Genome Atlas breastinvasive carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) dataset to get image data as input and genemutation information as the target, respectively. We achieved 84.6% accuracy(area under the curve (AUC) = 85.7%) on the validation dataset. To evaluate itsgeneralizability, we applied transfer learning techniques to predict World HealthOrganization (WHO) grade status, which also achieved a high accuracy of 91.4%(AUC = 94.8%) on validation dataset. With the properties of automatic featureextraction, and effective and high generalizability, M3D-DenseNet can serve as a useful method for other multimodal radiogenomics problems and has the potentialto be applied in clinical decision making.DOI: 10.3390/genes9080382 PMID: 30061525
