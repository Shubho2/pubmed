With an increasedunderstanding of tumor immune surveillance, immunotherapy has emerged as apromising treatment strategy for breast cancer, despite historically beingthought of as an immunologically silent neoplasm. Some types of cancer, such asmelanoma, bladder, and renal cell carcinoma, have demonstrated a durable responseto immunotherapeutic intervention, however, breast neoplasms have not shown thesame efficacy. The causes of breast cancer's immune silence derive frommechanisms that diminish immune recognition and others that promote strongimmunosuppression. It is the mechanisms of immune evasion in breast cancers that are poorly defined. Thus, further characterization is critical for thedevelopment of better therapies. This brief review will seek to provide insightinto the possible causes of weak immunogenicity and immune suppression mediatedby breast cancers and highlight current immunotherapies being used to restoreimmune responses to breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4441-3 PMCID: PMC5948714PMID: 29751789
