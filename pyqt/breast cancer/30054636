Patients wereenrolled in a subprotocol for secondary analysis from February 25, 2013, to July 29, 2016, after signing consent for the subprotocol. The analysis was performedin April 2018.Interventions: A blood sample was obtained for identification and enumeration of CTCs.Main Outcome and Measures: The association between a positive CTC assay result(at least 1 CTC per 7.5 mL of blood) and clinical recurrence.Results: Among 547 women included in this analysis, the results of the CTC assay were positive for 18 of 353 with hormone receptor-positive disease (5.1% [95% CI,3.0%-7.9%]); 23 of 353 patients (6.5% [95% CI, 4.2%-9.6%]) had a clinicalrecurrence. The recurrence rates per person-year of follow-up in the CTC-positiveand CTC-negative groups were 21.4% (7 recurrences per 32.7 person-years) and 2.0%(16 recurrences per 796.3 person-years), respectively. In multivariate modelsincluding clinical covariates, a positive CTC assay result was associated with a 13.1-fold higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio point estimate, 13.1; 95% CI,4.7-36.3). Seven of 23 patients (30.4% [95% CI, 13.2%-52.9%]) with recurrence hada positive CTC assay result at a median of 2.8 years (range, 0.1-2.8 years)before clinical recurrence. The CTC assay result was also positive for 8 of 193patients (4.1% [95% CI, 1.8%-8.0%]) with hormone receptor-negative disease,although only 1 patient (0.5% [95% CI, 0%-2.9%]) experienced disease recurrence(this patient was CTC negative).Conclusions and Relevance: A single positive CTC assay result 5 years afterdiagnosis of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer provided independentprognostic information for late clinical recurrence, which provides proof ofconcept that liquid-based biomarkers may be used to risk stratify for laterecurrence and guide therapy.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00433511.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.2574 PMID: 30054636
