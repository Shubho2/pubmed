Here, weemployed a phenotypic screen to identify and analyze the mechanism of action ofnovel small molecules that interfere with critical pathways involved in tumorcell growth, using chemoresistant A375 melanoma cells as a model.METHODS: Cell culture studies were performed in ATCC-recommended media.Compounds, and compound libraries were obtained from Boston University orpurchased commercially. Effects on A375 cell viability, proliferation andmorphology were determined by Celigo Image Cytometer and viability staining.Anticancer activity of the lead compound was tested in a xenograft nude mousemodel. Signaling and cell death pathways were analyzed by SDS-PAGE andimmunoblotting, and/or fluorescence microscopy.RESULTS: After evaluating 4477 compounds, one hit compound CB533 was identifiedthat caused significant reduction of A375 cell growth. CB533 is an unexplored1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ) derivative which unlike 1,4-NQ, induced rapid cell death without generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Structure-activity relationshipanalysis showed that a pyrrolidine in the 1,4-NQ nucleus in lead compound Pyr-1yielded optimal activity. CB533 and Pyr-1 had growth-suppressing effects on alarge variety of chemotherapy-resistant cancer cell lines in the nano topicomolar range. Pyr-1 also significantly reduced growth of MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells in nude mice. Pyr-1 rapidly induced activation of major stresspathways and autophagy, which was efficiently blocked by ERK, and somewhat byPI3K inhibitors.CONCLUSION: CB533 and lead Pyr-1 represent novel broad-spectrum, anticancercompounds that are up to 1000-fold more potent than plumbagin, a natural 1,4-NQwith known anticancer activity. Since the growth suppression activities of CB533 and Pyr-1 are unaffected by the chemotherapy resistance of cancer cells, thesecompounds have promising therapeutic potential. The pyrrolidine in the 3 positionof the 1,4-NQ nucleus of Pyr-1 is a critical component of the pharmacophore.Pyr-1-induced cellular stress was mediated by an ERK, and to a lesser extent byan AKT-dependent pathway without involving apoptosis. Our data suggest that Pyr-1derives its greatly enhanced antitumor activity via mimicking ROS-induced stress signaling without generating ROS, and likely committing cells to autophagy.DOI: 10.1186/s12929-018-0408-6 PMCID: PMC5804083PMID: 29422060
