[Epub ahead of print]Cancer patterns in Hmong in Minnesota, 2000 to 2012.Oyenuga M(1), Yang JK(1), Prizment AE(1)(2), Bushhouse S(3), Demerath EW(1),Spector LG(2)(4).Author information: (1)Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota.(2)Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.(3)Minnesota Cancer Reporting System, Minnesota Department of Health, St. Paul,Minnesota.(4)Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department ofPediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.BACKGROUND: Minnesota has the second largest Hmong population in the UnitedStates. The objective of the current study was to estimate the cancer incidenceamong Hmong individuals in Minnesota between 2000 and 2012 to determine targetsfor screening and interventions.METHODS: Cancer cases in Minnesota between 2000 and 2012 were obtained from theMinnesota Cancer Surveillance System, and proportional incidence ratios (PIRs)were calculated. The 2000 and 2010 US Census reports were used to obtain totalpopulation estimates. Age-adjusted cancer incidence rates (AAR) and 95%confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for Hmong individuals,Asian/Pacific Islander individuals, and all Minnesotans using direct method andPoisson regression.RESULTS: Compared with all Minnesotans, the Hmong had elevated PIRs and AARs for malignancies related to infections, including nasopharyngeal, stomach, liver, andcervical cancers. The AAR ratios in Hmong versus all Minnesotans were found to besignificantly increased for nasopharyngeal (AAR, 15.90; 95% CI, 9.48-26.68),stomach (AAR, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.06-4.33), liver (AAR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.04-3.02), andcervical (AAR, 3.88; 95% CI, 2.61-5.77) cancers. The AARs in Hmong versus allMinnesotans were significantly lower for all-cause cancer (AAR, 0.39; 95% CI,0.35-0.44); cancers of the breast, lung, and colorectum; melanoma; andnon-Hodgkin lymphoma. Compared with Asian/Pacific Islander individuals, the ratesin Hmong were significantly higher for melanoma and cervical cancer, with AARratios of 2.23 (95% CI, 1.09-4.56) and 1.59 (95% CI, 1.01-2.49), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with all Minnesotans, the Hmong have an increased incidenceof cancers related to infectious agents. These findings indicate a need forcancer prevention and screening programs in this population.
