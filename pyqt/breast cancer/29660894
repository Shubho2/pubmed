[Epub ahead of print]Overall survival of elderly patients with breast cancer is not related tobreast-cancer specific survival: A single institution experience in Japan.Takuwa H, Tsuji W, Yotsumoto F.BACKGROUND: As the aging population grows, the number of elderly breast cancerpatients has rapidly increased especially in Japan; a suitable treatment forelderly patients, considering chronic comorbidities and treatment tolerance, isurgently needed.METHODS: In this retrospective study, 286 elderly breast cancer patients wereinvestigated. Tumor characteristics and survival outcome were compared between70-79-year-old and ≥ 80-year-old groups. Disease-free survival, overall survival,and breast cancer-specific survival were compared, and the effect of variableswas analyzed statistically. For resectable cases, prognoses were compared basedon treatment (standard therapy or undertreated).RESULTS: Tumor characteristics were similar between groups, but the Ki-67labeling index tended to be higher in older patients. Elderly patients withresectable cancer tended to be undertreated. During the median 59-month follow-upperiod, overall survival was significantly worse in the ≥80-year-old than in the 70-79-year-old group (p < 0.001), but disease-free and breast cancer-specificsurvivals were equivalent. Recurrence or death event hazard rates tended to belower in patients receiving standard treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Standard multidisciplinary treatment for breast cancer preventsrecurrence and metastasis and tends to extend breast cancer-specific survivaleven in elderly patients.DOI: 10.3233/BD-170280 PMID: 29660894
