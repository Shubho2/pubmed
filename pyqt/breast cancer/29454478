Certain clinical risk factors have been described forincident CTRCD, and measurement of left ventricular (LV) longitudinal strain byspeckle tracking 2-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) is the best-validatedmyocardial mechanical imaging assessment to detect subtle changes in LV function during cancer treatment. However, the direct integration of clinical and imaging risk factors to predict CTRCD has not yet been extensively examined. This was aretrospective study of 183 women with breast cancer aged 50.9 ± 10.8 years whoreceived treatment with anthracyclines (doxorubicin dose of 422 ± 69 mg/m2, with 41.2% of subjects also receiving trastuzumab) and underwent 2DE at clinicallydetermined intervals. CTRCD was diagnosed when LV ejection fraction dropped ≥10% to a subnormal (<53%) value by 2DE. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain(LV-GLS) was assessed offline. The risk prediction tool based only on clinicalfactors previously described by Ezaz et al was applied to our cohort andaccurately stratified these subjects into low-, intermediate-, and high-riskgroups, with incident CTRCD in 7.4%, 26.9%, and 54.6%, respectively(chi-square = 20.7, p <0.0001). We developed novel multivariate models to predictCTRCD using (1) demographic variables only (c = 0.8674), (2) echocardiographic(peak LV-GLS) variables only (c = 0.8440), or (3) a combination of demographicand echocardiographic variables, with the combined model exhibiting superiorreceiver-operating characteristics (c = 0.9629). In conclusion, estimation ofCTRCD risk should integrate all available data, including both clinical variablesand an imaging assessment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
