It is unclearwhether 5T4 is preferentially expressed by stem or differentiated cell types.Modes of 5T4 regulation are unknown despite its ongoing development as a cancerimmunotherapy target. Our aims were to clarify the differentiation status of 5T4 expressing cells in breast cancer and to understand the mechanism underlying 5T4 membrane presentation.METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 5T4 expression in breast cancer cell populationsby flow cytometery and found that 5T4 is highly expressed on differentiatedcells, where it localizes to focal adhesions. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified interactions between 5T4 and the membrane traffickingproteins Rab11, Rab18 and ARF6. Mechanistically we found that Rab11 and Rab18have oppositional roles in controlling expression and surface presentation of5T4. 5T4 depletion stabilizes Rab11 protein expression with a consequentstimulation transferrin surface labelling, indicating that 5T4 repressesendocytic activity.IMPLICATIONS: Successful immunotherapeutic targeting of 5T4 requires surfacepresentation and different immunotherapy strategies require surface presentation versus endocytosis. While breast cancer cells with high 5T4 surface expressionand rapid cell surface turnover would be susceptible to antibody-drug conjugates that rely on intracellular release, 5T4 positive cells with lower expression orlower turnover may still be responsive to T-cell mediated approaches. We findthat endocytosis of 5T4 is strongly Rab11 dependent and as such Rab11 activitycould affect the success or failure of 5T4-targetted immunotherapy, particularly for antibody-drug conjugate approaches. In fact, 5T4 itself represses Rab11expression. This newly uncovered relationship between Rab11 and 5T4 suggests thatbreast tumours with high 5T4 expression may not have efficient endocytic uptakeof 5T4-targetted immunotherapeutics. This should be considered when selectingamongst the different types of immunotherapies.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.biocel.2018.03.002 PMID: 29549047
