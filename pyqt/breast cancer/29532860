[Epub ahead of print]Ciprofloxacin triggers the apoptosis of human triple-negative breast cancerMDA-MB-231 cells via the p53/Bax/Bcl-2 signaling pathway.Beberok A(1), Wrześniok D(1), Rok J(1), Rzepka Z(1), Respondek M(1), BuszmanE(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy with the Divisionof Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Silesia, 41-200 Sosnowiec, Poland.Fluoroquinolone antibiotics induce cytotoxicity in various cancer cell lines and may therefore represent a potentially important source of novel anticanceragents. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of ciprofloxacinon the viability, redox balance, apoptosis, expression of p53, Bax and Bcl-2,cell cycle distribution and DNA fragmentation of triple-negative MDA-MB-231breast cancer cells. The results of the present study demonstrated thatciprofloxacin decreases cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The half maximal inhibitory concentration values of ciprofloxacin in MDA-MB-231 cellsfollowing treatment for 24, 48 and 72 h were 0.83, 0.14 and 0.03 µmol/ml,respectively. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that ciprofloxacin altered theredox signaling pathway, as determined by intracellular glutathione depletion.The results of Annexin V/propidium iodide staining revealed that ciprofloxacintriggered the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, cipfloxacin treatmentstimulated the loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential via theBax/Bcl-2-dependent pathway, thus inducing apoptosis. Ciprofloxacin induced cell cycle arrest at the S-phase; therefore it was hypothesized that ciprofloxacininhibits topoisomerase II. Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the elevationof p53 expression were observed in the present study, indicating that thislate-apoptotic event may be mediated by the p53-dependent pathway. Therefore, theresults of the current study provide important molecular data concerning thecellular cascade, which may explain the cytotoxicity induced by ciprofloxacin in human triple-negative breast cancer cells, thus providing a novel insight intothe therapeutic properties of this drug.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4310 PMID: 29532860
