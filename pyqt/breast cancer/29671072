To addressthis problem, co-encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) and metformin (Met) in abiodegradable polymer composed of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) andD-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) was prepared. Wereported in our previous study that Met inhibits P-gp in DOX resistant breastcancer (MCF-7/DOX) cells. TPGS is a bioactive compound which has also been shown to inhibit P-gp, further to its pharmaceutical advantages.METHODS: The DOX/Met loaded PLGA-TPGS nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by doubleemulsion method and characterized for their surface morphology, size and sizedistribution, and encapsulation efficiencies of drugs in NPs.RESULTS: All NPs were found to be spherical-shaped with the size distributionbelow 100 nm and encapsulation efficiencies were 42.26 ± 2.14% for DOX and7.04 ± 0.52% for Met. Dual drug loaded NPs showed higher cytotoxicity andapoptosis in MCF-7/DOX cells in comparison to corresponding free drugs. Thehigher cytotoxicity of dual drug loaded NPs was attributed to the enhancedintracellular drug accumulation due to enhanced cellular uptake and reduced drug efflux which was obtained by combined effects of Met and TPGS in reducingcellular ATP content and inhibiting P-gp.CONCLUSION: Simultaneous delivery of DOX and Met via PLGA-TPGS NPs would be apromising approach to overcome MDR in breast cancer chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s11095-018-2404-7 PMID: 29671072
