Here we analyzed the immunopeptidomes of sixHLA-A2-positive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) samples by nano-ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nUPLC-MS2 ).Immunopeptidomic profiling identified a total of 19 675 peptides from tumor andadjacent normal tissue and 130 of the peptides were found to have higherabundance in tumor than in normal tissues. To determine potential therapeutictarget proteins, we calculated the average tumor-associated cohort coverage(aTaCC) that represents the percentage coverage of each protein in this cohort bypeptides that had higher tumoral abundance. Cofilin-1 (CFL-1), interleukin-32(IL-32), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), syntenin-1 (SDCBP), andribophorin-2 (RPN-2) were found to have the highest aTaCC scores. We propose thatthese antigens could be evaluated further for their potential as targets inbreast cancer immunotherapy and the small cohort immunopeptidomics analysistechnique could be used in a wide spectrum of target discovery.
