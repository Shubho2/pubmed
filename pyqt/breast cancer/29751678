Toimprove the pharmacological profile of EGCG, we previously developed a family of EGCG derivatives and the lead compounds G28, G37 and G56 were characterized inHER2-positive breast cancer cells overexpressing FASN. Here, diesters G28, G37and G56 and two G28 derivatives, monoesters M1 and M2, were synthesized andassessed in vitro for their cytotoxic, FASN inhibition and apoptotic activitiesin MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. All compounds displayedmoderate to high cytotoxicity and significantly blocked FASN activity, monoestersM1 and M2 being more potent inhibitors than diesters. Interestingly, G28, M1, andM2 also diminished FASN protein expression levels, but only monoesters M1 and M2 induced apoptosis. Our results indicate that FASN inhibition by such polyphenoliccompounds could be a new strategy in TNBC treatment, and highlight the potential anticancer activities of monoesters. Thus, G28, G37, G56, and most importantly M1and M2, are anticancer candidates (alone or in combination) to be furthercharacterized in vitro and in vivo.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23051160 PMID: 29751678
