However, thecontent of genetic counseling could be difficult to understand due to complexmedical information. The aim of this study was to investigate if comprehensioncan be improved with a new genetic counseling tool (NGCT hereafter; a tool thatcombines complex medical information with pictures, diagrams and tables) ascompared to conventional oral-only genetic counseling (CGC).METHODS: 207 clients attended genetic counseling for hereditary breast andovarian cancer at the Medical University of Vienna between February 2015 andFebruary 2016. Seventy clients participated in this study and were allocated intotwo groups: the first 36 participants received conventional (oral only) geneticcounseling (CGC) and the following 34 participants received genetic counselingusing a new genetic counseling tool (NGCT), which combines complex informationwith pictures, diagrams and tables. After genetic counseling, all consentingparticipants were invited to complete a questionnaire with seven questionsevaluating their comprehension of the medical information provided.RESULTS: Socio-demographic backgrounds were comparable in both groups. Correctresponses were significantly higher in the NGCT group compared to the CGC group(p = 0.012). NGCT also statistically improves correct response of Q1 (p = 0.03)and Q7 (p = 0.004).CONCLUSION: The NGCT leads to an overall better understanding of the content of agenetic counseling session than CGC alone.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200559 PMCID: PMC6042777PMID: 30001421
