We aimed to assess the frequency with which medical oncologists andsurgeons order BRCA 1/2 and Oncotype DX testing for breast cancer patients.METHODS: We surveyed 732 oncologists and surgeons treating breast cancerpatients. Physicians were from Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania,and were listed in the 2010 AMA Masterfile or identified by patients.RESULTS: 80.6% of providers ordered BRCA 1/2 testing at least sometimes and 85.4%ordered Oncotype DX (p = 0.01). More frequent ordering of BRCA 1/2 was associatedwith more positive attitudes toward genetic innovation (OR 1.14, p = 0.001), abelief that testing was likely to be covered by patients' insurance (OR 2.84,p < 0.001), and more frequent ordering of Oncotype DX testing (OR 8.69,p < 0.001). More frequent use of Oncotype DX was associated with a belief thattesting was likely to be covered by insurance (OR 7.33, p < 0.001), as well aswith more frequent ordering of BRCA 1/2 testing (OR 9.48, p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one in five providers never or rarely ever ordered BRCA 1/2testing for their breast cancer patients, and nearly 15% never or rarely everordered Oncotype DX. Less frequent ordering of BRCA 1/2 is associated with lessfrequent use of Oncotype DX testing, and vice versa. Those who do not order BRCA 1/2 testing report less positive attitudes toward genetic innovation. Furthereducation of this subset of providers regarding the benefits of precisionmedicine may enable more rapid diffusion of genetic technology.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4810-2 PMID: 29737473
