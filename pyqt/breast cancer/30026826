However, their prognostic significance in themolecular subtype of basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) is poorly understood. Theaim of this study was to investigate the extent and patterns of TAMs in BLBC and their associations with clinicopathological features and patient survival.Methods and Results: We evaluated TAMs in 200 cases of BLBC byimmunohistochemistry using the M2 macrophage marker CD163 and the pan-macrophage marker CD68 in tumor nest and stroma, and assessed their prognostic significance.The study demonstrated that infiltration of CD163+ and CD68+ macrophages in tumorstroma was of clinical relevance in BLBC, but not those in tumor nest. Increased stromal infiltration of CD68+ or CD163+ macrophages correlated with larger tumor size, higher histological grade, higher 5-year recurrence and 5-year breastcancer mortality. Although both of CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages in tumor stromawere associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival(OS), multivariate analysis demonstrated that only CD163+ macrophage was anindependent predictor of RFS and OS. Conclusions: Our results highlight theprognostic importance of TAMs' location in BLBC. CD163, a highly specificbiomarker for M2 macrophages, is an independent prognostic marker for BLBCpatients, and may serve as an indicator or potential target of macrophage-centredtherapeutic strategies.DOI: 10.7150/jca.25155 PMCID: PMC6036715PMID: 30026826
