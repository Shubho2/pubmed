Late studies have proved the part of tyrosine kinases in the pathophysiologyof cancer diseases. This current research paper has focused on investigating the novel Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines and Pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines as a smallmolecules that can inhibit tyrosine kinase in cancer cells. NCI protocol wasapplied to test the antitumor activity of such compounds. Leukemia and renalcancer cell lines proved to be sensitive to some derivatives such as 6b-d, 9a and11 with GI% values ranging from 30.4 to 41.3%. In addition, compound 11 proved tobe the most active against MCF-7 with GI% 62.5. The synthesized compounds werealso evaluated for their inhibitory effects against EGFR kinase enzyme. Compound 9b proved to be the most active one among the synthesized series with inhibition % value of 81.72 at 25 nM concentration and IC50 8.4 nM which is very close tothe reference drug Sorafenib. In vitro cytotoxicity test was also performed usingthe MCF-7 breast cell line. Computer modeling using the active site of tyrosinekinase as a template and the most active tyrosine kinase inhibitors werecalculated. Docking studies of the synthesized compounds into the active site of EGFR kinase domain showed good agreement with the obtained biological results.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
