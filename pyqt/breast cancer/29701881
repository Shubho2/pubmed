[Epub ahead of print]Pentameric last-digit preference and stage border avoidance in pathologymeasurement.den Bakker MA(1), Damhuis RAM(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Maasstad Hospital, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.(2)Department of Research, Comprehensive Cancer Organisation, Utrecht, theNetherlands.AIMS: Cancer treatment relies on accurate staging, an essential aspect of whichis determination of the size of a tumour. Measuring the size of a tumour in dailypractice often proves problematic and results in rounding of values toapproximate values. It has been shown that size values are most frequentlyreported with end digits of 0 or 5.METHODS AND RESULTS: We sought to determine whether this observation holds truein our national cancer registry of breast and lung tumours. Data from patientswith breast and lung cancer were retrieved from the Netherlands National CancerRegistry and analysed for tumour size. Whereas a preference for terminal digitsof 0 or 5 (pentameric preference) was clearly present for lung cancer, criticalpentameric values at stage boundaries were avoided in breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, pathologists adopt a practical approach to tumoursize measurement by rounding values and avoiding stage border boundary values,thus circumventing potential difficulties in treatment decisions.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/his.13640 PMID: 29701881
