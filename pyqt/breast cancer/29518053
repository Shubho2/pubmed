Using the partial structure of flavokawain B (FKB), about 23 analogs have been synthesized.Among them, compounds 8, 13 and 23 were found in new FKB derivatives. Allcompounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic properties against two breast cancercell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, thus establishing the structure-activityrelationship. The FKB derivatives 16 (IC50 = 6.50 ± 0.40 and 4.12 ± 0.20 μg/mL), 15 (IC50 = 5.50 ± 0.35 and 6.50 ± 1.40 μg/mL) and 13 (IC50 = 7.12 ± 0.80 and 4.04± 0.30 μg/mL) exhibited potential cytotoxic effects on the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cell lines. However, the methoxy group substituted in position three and four in compound 2 (IC50 = 8.90 ± 0.60 and 6.80 ± 0.35 μg/mL) and 22 (IC50 = 8.80 ± 0.35 and 14.16 ± 1.10 μg/mL) exhibited good cytotoxicity. The lead compound FKB (1)showed potential cytotoxicity (IC50 = 7.70 ± 0.30 and 5.90 ± 0.30 μg/mL) against two proposed breast cancer cell lines. It is evident that the FKB skeleton isunique for anticancer agents, additionally, the presence of halogens (Cl and F)in position 2 and 3 also improved the cytotoxicity in FKB series. These findings could help to improve the future drug discovery process to treat breast cancer. Amolecular dynamics study of active compounds revealed stable interactions within the active site of Janus kinase. The structures of all compounds were determined by ¹H-NMR, EI-MS, IR and UV and X-ray crystallographic spectroscopy techniques.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23030616 PMID: 29518053
