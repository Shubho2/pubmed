This study aimedto develop a nomogram to predict additional nodal disease in patients with +SLNafter NAC.METHODS: The study reviewed patients 18 years of age or older who had invasivebreast cancer treated with NAC followed by SLN surgery with +SLN and ALND between2006 and 2017 at the authors' institution. Factors predictive of positivenon-SLNs were analyzed using uni- and multivariable logistic regression.RESULTS: The study identified 120 patients with +SLN after NAC and ALND. Of thesepatients, 30.8% were clinically node-negative (cN-), and 69.2% were clinicallynode-positive (cN+) before NAC. Tumor biology was human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2-positive (HER2+) for 20%, hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2- for66.7%, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) for 13.3% of the patients.Additional nodal disease was found on ALND for 63.3% of the patients. In theunivariate analysis, the factors predictive of positive non-SLNs were biologicsubtype (TNBC and HR+/HER2- vs HER2+; p < 0.001), higher grade (p = 0.047),higher pT category (p = 0.02), SLN extranodal extension (p = 0.03), larger SLNmetastasis size (p < 0.001), and higher number of +SLNs (p = 0.02). The factorssignificant in the multivariable analysis included number of +SLNs, grade 3 vsgrade 1 or 2, HER2+ versus HER2-, cN+ versus cN-, and larger SLN metastasis size.The resulting model showed excellent discrimination (area under the curve, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.90) and good calibration (p = 0.54,Hosmer-Lemeshow).CONCLUSION: A clinical prediction model incorporating biologic subtype, grade,clinical node status, size of the largest SLN metastasis, and number of +SLNs canhelp physicians and patients estimate the likelihood of additional nodal disease and may be useful for guiding decision making regarding axillary management.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6578-3 PMID: 29956095
