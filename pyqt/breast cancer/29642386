In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, combination treatment with severalanti-cancer drugs is employed and improves overall survival in some patients.Nevertheless, most patients with metastatic disease are not cured owing to thedrug resistance. Cancer stem cells are known to regulate resistance tochemotherapy. In the previous study, we established a novel three-dimensionalorganoid culture model from tumor colorectal tissues of human patients using anair-liquid interface (ALI) method, which contained numerous cancer stem cells andshowed resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and Irinotecan. Here, we investigatewhich inhibitor for stem cell-related signal improves the sensitivity foranti-cancer drug treatment in tumor ALI organoids. Treatment with Hedgehog signalinhibitors (AY9944, GANT61) decreases the cell viability of organoids comparedwith Notch (YO-01027, DAPT) and Wnt (WAV939, Wnt-C59) signal inhibitors.Combination treatment of AY9944 or GANT61 with 5-FU, Irinotecan or Oxaliplatindecreases the cell viability of tumor organoids compared with each anti-cancerdrug alone treatment. Treatment with AY9944 or GANT61 inhibits expression of stemcell markers c-Myc, CD44 and Nanog, likely through the decrease of theirtranscription factor, GLI-1 expression. Combination treatment of AY9944 or GANT61with 5-FU or Irinotecan also prevents colony formation of colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 and SW480. These findings suggest that Hedgehog signals mediateanti-cancer drug resistance in colorectal tumor patient-derived ALI organoids andthat the inhibitors are useful as a combinational therapeutic strategy againstcolorectal cancer.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19041098 PMCID: PMC5979580PMID: 29642386
