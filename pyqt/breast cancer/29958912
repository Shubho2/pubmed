Electronic address:zhipingzhang@mail.hust.edu.cn.Tumor heterogeneity is considered as one of main obstacles to limit the clinical application of stimuli-responsive nanocarriers. Multidrug resistance (MDR) isalso a major challenge in cancer chemotherapy. Here, we developed a tumor redoxheterogeneity-responsive prodrug with self-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplification property for facilitating rapid drug release and overcoming MDR andlung metastasis. The prodrug can self-assemble into polymer micelles (PMs) withhigh drug loading content (~30%), good physiological stability, prolongedsystemic circulation and enhanced tumor distribution. Moreover, the prodrug PMscan stimulate tumor-specific ROS signal amplification, which provided areplenishment of consumed ROS necessary for rapid and complete drug release. The elevated ROS could not only evoke the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis bycaspase-9/3 activation, but also inhibit inherent and acquired drug resistance byaltering expression of Bcl-2 protein family and by reducing mitochondria membranepotential (ΔΨm) and ATP level in cancer cells. As a result, the prodrug PMsshowed enhanced efficacy for inhibiting tumor growth in S180 sarcoma tumor model and in drug-resistant tumor model MCF-7/ADR and preventing lung metastasis in 4T1in situ breast cancer model. This novel approach reported here may provide apromising strategy in the design of stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for efficienttherapy of multidrug resistant and metastatic tumor.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
