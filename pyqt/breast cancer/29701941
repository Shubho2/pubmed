In themammary gland, CYP19 gene is expressed at low levels under the regulation of its I.4 promoter. In hormone-dependent breast cancer, fibroblast cells surroundingthe tumor express increased levels of CYP19 mRNA due to a decrease of I.4promoter activity and an increase of PII, I.3, and I.7 promoter activity. Little is known about the effects of environmental chemicals on the promoter-specificCYP19 expression.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the effects of two neonicotinoids (thiaclopridand imidacloprid) on promoter-specific CYP19 expression in Hs578t breast cancercells and understand the signaling pathways involved.METHODS: Hs578t cells were exposed to various signaling pathway stimulants orneonicotinoids for 24 h. Promoter-specific expression of CYP19 was determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and catalytic activity ofaromatase by tritiated water release assay.RESULTS: To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the normal I.4promoter and the breast cancer-relevant PII, I.3, and I.7 promoters of CYP19 are active in these cells. We found that the expression of CYP19 via promoters PII,I.3, and I.7 in Hs578t cells was, in part, dependent on the activation of twoVEGF signaling pathways: mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1/3 andphospholipase C (PLC). Exposure of Hs578t cells to environmental concentrationsof imidacloprid and thiacloprid resulted in a switch in CYP19 promoter usage,involving inhibition of I.4 promoter activity and an increase of PII, I.3, andI.7 promoter-mediated CYP19 expression and aromatase catalytic activity. Greater effects were seen at lower concentrations. Our results suggest that thiaclopridand imidacloprid exert their effects at least partially by inducing the MAPK 1/3 and/or PLC pathways.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated in vitro that neonicotinoids may stimulate a change in CYP19 promoter usage similar to that observed in patients withhormone-dependent breast cancer. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2698.DOI: 10.1289/EHP2698 PMCID: PMC6071809PMID: 29701941
