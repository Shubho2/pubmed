Herein, we report a case with metastatic colonic and gastric lesionsfrom breast cancer, with the formation of mucosal polyps which resembled typical hyperplastic polyps.A 47-year-old woman underwent curable surgery for breastcancer and received standard systemic treatments. Her primary tumor was composed of a mix of invasive lobular and ductal carcinomas. During adjuvant endocrinetherapy, she developed multiple colonic metastases, identified by colonoscopyperformed as part of a general health check-up. She had no symptoms. Smallelevated sessile polyps in the transverse colon and rectum showed histologicalfeatures of signet-ring cell type adenocarcinoma, similar to the invasive lobularcomponent of the primary breast cancer. During treatments for recurrent disease, she also developed multiple gastric metastases, with the same endoscopic andpathological features as the colonic lesions. Her treatment regimen was switched to oral chemotherapy, and she has since maintained stable disease for nearly3Â years. Multiple bone metastases eventually developed, and she was againswitched to another systemic treatment but, to date, has remained free ofsymptoms.We emphasize that the endoscopic findings of the metastatic lesions inthe colon and stomach in this case highly resembled hyperplastic polyps. Sincebiopsy is not always performed for hyperplastic polyps in the gastrointestinaltract, we believe that this case report may encourage endoscopists to offerbiopsies to the patient who has a history of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s40792-018-0433-4 PMCID: PMC5866257PMID: 29572575
