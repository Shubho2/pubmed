Notably, the mammary epitheliumis contiguous with the external environment, is exposed to bacteria duringlactation, and displays antimicrobial features. Nonetheless, immunologicalhallmarks predictive of mucosal function have not been demonstrated in themammary gland, including immune tolerance to foreign Ags under homeostasis. This inquiry is important, as mucosal immunity in the mammary gland may assure infant and women's health during lactation. Further, such mucosal immune programs mayprotect mammary function at the expense of breast cancer promotion via decreased immune surveillance. In this study, using murine models, we evaluated mammaryspecific mucosal attributes focusing on two reproductive states at increased riskfor foreign and self-antigen exposure: lactation and weaning-induced involution. We find a baseline mucosal program of RORγT+ CD4+ T cells that is elevated withinlactating and involuting mammary glands and is extended during involution toinclude tolerogenic dendritic cell phenotypes, barrier-supportive antimicrobials,and immunosuppressive Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells. Further, we demonstrate suppression ofAg-dependent CD4+ T cell activation, data consistent with immune tolerance. Wealso find Ag-independent accumulation of memory RORγT+ Foxp3+ CD4+ T cellsspecifically within the involution mammary gland consistent with an active immuneprocess. Overall, these data elucidate strong mucosal immune programs withinlactating and involuting mammary glands. Our findings support the classification of the mammary gland as a temporal mucosal organ and open new avenues forexploration into breast pathologic conditions, including compromised lactationand breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800023 PMCID: PMC6036228PMID: 29884705
