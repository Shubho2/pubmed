However, optimal treatment strategies for those with high-riskbiology remain unclear.METHODS: We reviewed the records of women ages 80-89 years with biopsy-proven,Stage I-II invasive breast cancer who were referred for surgical evaluation from January 2001 through December 2010. High-risk was defined as human epidermalgrowth factor receptor-positive (HER2+), triple-negative (TN), or histologicgrade 3 disease.RESULTS: Among 178 patients, 40 (22%) were high-risk: 12 were grade 1-2 (10HER2 + , 2 TN); 28 were grade 3 (7 HER2+, 6 TN, 15 estrogen receptor-positive(ER+)/HER2-). The high-risk group had larger tumors and more often had ductalhistology and lymphovascular invasion than the low-risk group and was more likelyto undergo mastectomy (18 vs. 5%, p = 0.02), radiotherapy (55 vs. 36%, p = 0.03),and chemotherapy (10 vs. 0%, p = 0.002). Endocrine therapy use was similar among ER+ patients in both groups. The four patients in the high-risk group givenchemotherapy were HER2+ and received trastuzumab-based regimens, without anyreported toxicities. At median follow-up of 67 months, 10% of the high-risk grouphad a recurrence (3 distant-only, 1 simultaneous locoregional and distant in apatient treated with mastectomy without radiotherapy).CONCLUSIONS: Tailored locoregional and systemic therapy resulted in low incidenceof failure in these octogenarians with high-risk cancers with low morbidity.Modern adjuvant therapies should be considered for elderly women with high-riskcancers in the absence of significant comorbidities.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6350-8 PMCID: PMC5930070PMID: 29427213
