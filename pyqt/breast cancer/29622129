Electronic address: Linda.Moy@nyumc.org.This article reviews new developments in breast imaging. There is growinginterest in creating a shorter, less expensive MR protocol with broaderapplicability. There is an increasing focus on and consideration for the additiveimpact that functional analysis of breast pathology have on identifying andcharacterizing lesions. These developments apply to MR imaging and molecularimaging. This article reviews evolving breast imaging techniques with attentionto strengths, weaknesses, and applications of these approaches. We aim to givethe reader familiarity with the state of current developments in the field and toincrease awareness of what to expect in breast imaging.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.
