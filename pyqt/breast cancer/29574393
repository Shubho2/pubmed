We aim to further evaluate the performance ofOSNA assay for the intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science databases were searched toretrieve related literature published up until December 2017. This meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Risks of bias and quality assessmentsof included studies were evaluated and subgroup analysis was performed.RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in this meta-analysis. For overallmetastasis, the pooled sensitivity, specificity and area under the summaryreceiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) were 0.90, 0.96 and 0.98,respectively. For macrometastasis, the pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUCwere 0.85, 0.98 and 0.94, respectively.CONCLUSION: OSNA assay is an accurate molecular diagnosis for intraoperativedetection of sentinel lymph node macrometastasis in breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
