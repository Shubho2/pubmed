The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is widely used to evaluateglobal inflammation in various tumor types. However, the prognostic role of NLRin non-metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients was poorly known.The aim of this study was to explore the association between pre-treatment NLRand survival in TNBC patients. Data were collected for patients with stages I-IIITNBC from 2006 to 2013 at Linyi Central Hospital to analyze pre-treatment NLR andsurvival. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated bythe Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox analysis was performed to determineclinicopathological parameters for their prognostic relevance. A total of 406patients were eligible. Patients with NLR lower than 2.85 exhibited significantlyhigher OS (P < 0.001) and DFS (P < 0.001) than patients with higher NLR. Higherpre-treatment NLR was independently correlated with poor OS and DFS, with hazard ratios of 2.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.94-3.72, P = 0.001) and 2.13 (95%CI: 1.68-2.65, P = 0.008), respectively, in the Cox proportional multivariatehazard model. In conclusion, our results indicate that pre-treatment NLR may becorrelated with OS and DFS in early-stage TNBC patients, and that it may haveconsiderable clinical applications. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(6):529-535, 2018.© 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.DOI: 10.1002/iub.1745 PMID: 29707892
