Relevant clinical and oncological dataand cancer phenotype were retrieved. All participants were genotyped for thepredominant Jewish BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations using a chip-based assay.Those who tested negative were further genotyped for three recurring mutations inCHEK2 (c.1100delC, p.S428F, p.I157T), and single mutations in the FANCM(c.5791C>T), and RAD51D (c.556C>T) genes, by direct sequencing. The ethicscommittee approved the study.RESULTS: Overall, 61 MBC were identified and genotyped, 41 (67.2%) wereAshkenazim, age at diagnosis was 58.1 ± 12.6 years, and 31 (50.8%) had a familyhistory of cancer. Of genotyped individuals, one (1.6%) harboured the 185delAG*BRCA1 mutation, 7 (11.4%) the 6174delT*BRCA2 mutation and 2 (3.2%) otherrecurring mutations in BRCA2 (overall 10/61-16.4% BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers).Of BRCA-negative cases, 3/51 (5.9%) carried the p.S428F *CHEK2 mutation. None wasa carrier of the other genotyped mutations in CHEK2, FANCM or RAD51D.CONCLUSION: BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 germline mutations contribute to inheritedpredisposition to MBC in Israel.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4765-3 PMID: 29560538
