Recent reports suggest that laser therapy may be valuable as a not hormonal therapeutic modality. The aim of the present study was to evaluatethe effects of fractional CO2 laser treatment on the vaginal secretory pathway ofa large panel of immune mediators, usually implicated in tissue remodeling andinflammation, and on microbiome composition in postmenopausal breast cancersurvivors. The Ion Torrent PGM platform and the Luminex Bio-Plex platform wereused for microbiome and immune factor analysis. The significant reduction ofclinical symptoms and the non-significant changes in vaginal microbiome supportthe efficacy and safety of laser treatment. Moreover, the high remodeling status in vaginal epithelium is demonstrated by the significant changes in inflammatory and modulatory cytokine patterns. Laser therapy can be used for the treatment of GSM symptoms and does not show any adverse effects. However, further studies willbe needed to clarify its long-term efficacy and other effects.DOI: 10.1007/s10103-018-2471-3 PMID: 29492713  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
