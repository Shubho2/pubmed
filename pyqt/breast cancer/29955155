Although many cellular factors are involved inTGF-β induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration, verylittle is known with the mechanism of Smad4 regulation on pro-oncogenes response by TGF-β. Herein, we demonstrate the interaction of Sentrin-specific protease 2(SENP2) with Smad4 through SENP2 residue 363~400. The same segment is alsoimportant for desumoylation of Smad4, and able to relieve sumoylation-mediatedTGF-β repression. The SENP2363~400 segment is critical for TGF-β-induced cellmigration, which is correlated with SENP2363~400 deletion mutant failed toincrease matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and EMT marker gene expression.Moreover, our results suggest that the interaction and desumoylation betweenSENP2 and Smad4 promote cell migration in triple-negative breast cancer cells.Altogether, our data show how SENP2 regulates its substrate for desumoylation,and also the role of SENP2 in TGF-β induced cancer cell migration.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-28103-8 PMCID: PMC6023881PMID: 29955155
