BM are major causes ofmorbidity and mortality in cancer patients.Aims: We describe a mixed population (data from both retrospective andprospective collection) having a BM from a solid tumor. We report the percentage distribution of the most frequent types of BM, confirming the data published inthe literature. This paper may play a role in presenting the Southeast Asianreality compared with the Western countries.Setting: A tertiary-care cancer centre.Materials and Methods: Data for 4 years were retrieved from the records of theDepartment of Pathology of our institute. Hematolymphoid and meningeal tumorswere excluded. Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stained slides were reviewed, and in cases with an unknown primary, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was advised. Thepanel of markers was chosen based on the histomorphology on H and E sections. IHCwas done in cases with an unknown primary where paraffin blocks were available.Results: Lung cancer was found to be the most common primary malignancy (n = 30; 48.4%) followed by breast cancer (n = 13; 21%), colorectal cancer (n = 6; 9.6%), and skin cancer (melanoma) [n = 3; 4.8%].Conclusion: The incidence of BM from lung and breast cancer was similar to thatseen in the Western studies. However, BM from colorectal cancer and melanoma showa higher and lower incidence, respectively, in comparison with the Westernliterature.DOI: 10.4103/0028-3886.232333 PMID: 29766934
