A total of 9867 patients with CHB were followed up for ≥12months for the occurrence of any type of malignancy between 1998 and 2013.Patients who received NA for ≥180 days were defined as the NA group. Propensityscore matching produced the control (n = 2220) and NA groups (n = 2220) afteradjustment for age, sex, and the presence of diabetes mellitus and livercirrhosis. The National Health Insurance Service sample cohort dataset was usedfor external validation. Regarding non-HCC malignancies, only old age was anindependent risk factor (>50 years; hazard ratio 3.17, 95% confidence interval1.71-5.88, P < .001) in multivariate analysis. With regard to specific cancerssuch as thyroid, breast, lung, stomach, colorectal, pancreatobiliary, andhematologic malignancy, there was no difference of the incidence of eachmalignancy between the NA and control groups in both the hospital-based andexternal validation cohorts. NA treatment neither raises nor lowers the incidenceof non-HCC malignancies in patients with CHB. Patients >50 years old areencouraged to undergo surveillance for malignancies similar to the generalpopulation.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011087 PMCID: PMC6023687PMID: 29901622  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
