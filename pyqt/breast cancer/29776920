The factors determining shorter sick leave duration of patients withBC have not been clearly identified. The aim of this study was to describe workduring BC treatment and to identify factors associated with sick leave duration.MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, prospective, multicentre study wasconducted among women with operable BC. A logbook was given to all workingpatients to record sociodemographic and work-related data over a 1-year period.RESULTS: Work-related data after BC were available for 178 patients (60%). Themedian age at diagnosis was 50 years (27-77), 87.9% of patients had an invasiveform of BC and 25.3% a lymph node involvement. 25.9% had a radical surgery and24.2% had an axillary dissection. Radiotherapy was performed in 90.9% of patientsand chemotherapy in 48.1%. Sick leave was prescribed for 165 patients (92.7%) fora median of 155 days. On univariate analysis, invasive BC (p=0.025), lymph nodeinvolvement (p=0.005), radical surgery (p=0.025), axillary dissection (p=0.004), chemotherapy (p<0.001), personal income <€1900/month (p=0.03) and not havingreceived the patient information booklet on RTW (p=0.047) were found to beassociated with a longer duration of sick leave. On multivariate analysis,chemotherapy was found to be associated with longer sick leave (OR: 3.5; 95% CI1.6 to 7.9; p=0.002). The cost of sick leave to French National Health Insurance was fourfold higher in the case of chemotherapy (p<0.001).CONCLUSION: Advanced disease and chemotherapy are major factors that influencesick leave duration during the management of BC.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02813317.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
