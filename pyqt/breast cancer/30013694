Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonemanipulation constitute the major treatment options for breast cancer. Here, weshow that both a natural antimicrobial peptide (AMP) derived from wasp venom(decoralin, Dec-NH2), and its synthetic variants generated via peptide design,display potent activity against cancer cells. We tested the derivatives atincreasing doses and observed anticancer activity at concentrations as low as12.5 μmol L-1 for the selective targeting of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Flowcytometry assays further revealed that treatment with wild-type (WT) peptideDec-NH2 led to necrosis of MCF-7 cells. Additional atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements indicated that the roughness of cancer cell membranes increasedsignificantly when treated with lead peptides compared to controls. Biophysicalfeatures such as helicity, hydrophobicity, and net positive charge wereidentified to play an important role in the anticancer activity of the peptides. Indeed, abrupt changes in peptide hydrophobicity and conformational propensityled to peptide inactivation, whereas increasing the net positive charge ofpeptides enhanced their activity. We present peptide templates with selectiveactivity towards breast cancer cells that leave normal cells unaffected. Thesetemplates represent excellent scaffolds for the design of selective anticancerpeptide therapeutics.DOI: 10.3762/bjoc.14.144 PMCID: PMC6036970PMID: 30013694
