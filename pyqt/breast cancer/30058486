India.The 6-substituted indolo[2,3-b]quinolines have been synthesized and explored aspotential cytotoxic agents. Ultrasound assisted synthesis of these compounds was carried out by using a method involving two sequential C-N bond forming reactionsbetween 3-(2-bromophenyl)-2-chloroquinoline and amines in a single pot in thepresence of Pd(OAc)2 and a ligand (S)-BINAP. The synthesized compounds showedpromising growth inhibition when tested against breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7)cancer cell lines and the best compound induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1389557518666180727170055 PMID: 30058486
