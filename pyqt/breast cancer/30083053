We used a 298-sample retrospective training set todevelop an immunohistochemistry-based novel risk classifier calledCanAssist-Breast (CAB) which combines 5 prognostically relevant biomarkers and 3 clinico-pathological parameters to arrive at probability of distant recurrencewithin 5 years from diagnosis. Five selected biomarkers, namely, CD44, ABCC4,ABCC11, N-cadherin, and pan-cadherin, were chosen based on their role in tumormetastasis. The chosen biomarkers represent the hallmarks of cancer and aredistinct from other proliferation and gene expression-based prognosticsignatures. The 3 clinico-pathological parameters integrated into the machinelearning-based CAB algorithm are tumor size, tumor grade, and node status. These features are used to calculate a "CAB risk score" that classifies patients intolow- or high-risk groups and predicts probability of distant recurrence in5 years. Independent clinical validation of CAB in a retrospective studycomprising 196 patients indicated that distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS)was significantly different in the 2 risk groups. The difference in DMFS between the low- and high-risk categories was 19% in the validation cohort (P = .0002).In multivariate analysis, CAB risk score was the most significant independentpredictor of distant recurrence with a hazard ratio of 4.3 (P = .0003).CanAssist-Breast is a precise and unique machine learning-based proteomicrisk-classifier that can assist in risk stratification of patients withearly-stage HR+ breast cancer.DOI: 10.1177/1177271918789100 PMCID: PMC6066801PMID: 30083053
