Therefore, the development of novel ErbB2-targeting strategies is necessary.Importantly, ErbB2 is a sensitive client protein of heat shock protein 90(HSP90), which regulates client protein folding, maturation, and stabilization.HSP90 inhibition provides an alternative therapeutic strategy for ErbB2-targeted degradation. In particular, ganetespib, a novel HSP90 inhibitor, is a promisingagent for ErbB2+ cancers. Nevertheless, the anti-cancer efficacy and clinicalapplication of ganetespib for ErbB2+ breast cancer is largely unknown. In ourstudy, we examined the anti-cancer effects of ganetespib on ErbB2+ BT474 andSKBR3 breast cancer cells, and isogenic paired cancer cell lines withlentivirus-mediated ErbB2 overexpression. Ganetespib potently inhibited cellproliferation, cell cycle progression, survival, and activation/phosphorylationof ErbB2 and key downstream effectors in ErbB2+ breast cancer cells. Moreover,ganetespib decreased the total protein levels of HSP90 client proteins andreduced ErbB2 protein half-life. ErbB2-overexpressing cancer cells were also moresensitive to ganetespib-mediated growth inhibition than parental cells.Ganetespib also strikingly potentiated the inhibitory effects of lapatinib inBT474 and SKBR3 cells. Ultimately, our results support the application ofganetespib-mediated HSP90 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy forErbB2+ breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25284-0 PMID: 29717218
