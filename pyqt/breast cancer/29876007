Because triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most refractory to current anti-cancer therapies, efficient treatment has been urgently required. Members of the Bcl-2 family play pro- andanti-apoptotic roles in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Some Bcl-2 familymembers are expressed in breast cancer and influence the response to anti-cancer therapies. In this study, we investigated whether Bcl-2 inhibition couldsensitize TNBC cells to the genotoxic drug doxorubicin (DR). Treatment with acombination of the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 and DR synergistically decreased theviability of the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549. In an apoptosis assay,the combination treatment resulted in only a marginal effect in BT-549 cells,whereas drastic apoptosis was induced in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with bothABT-199 and DR. Both caspase-8 and -9 were involved in the combinationtreatment-induced apoptosis. Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Bcl-2increased the sensitivity of both cell lines to DR. The combination treatmentalso significantly decreased the colony-forming ability of the TNBC cell lines.In a xenograft mouse model, oral administration of ABT-199 augmented theDR-induced antitumor effect on subcutaneously established MDA-MB-231 cells. Theseresults indicate that the combination of DR with Bcl-2 inhibitors, includingABT-199, may be a promising treatment modality for TNBC patients.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25370 PMCID: PMC5986635PMID: 29876007
