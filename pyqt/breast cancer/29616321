Inconsistentepidemiological results may be explained by varied mechanisms involving PUFAs andredox balance, inflammatory status and cell signalling, along with interactionswith other dietary components such as antioxidants, dietary fibre and moregenerally fruits and vegetable intakes. Therefore, this study aimed toinvestigate the associations between lipid intakes and cancer risk, and theirpotential modulation by vitamin C, vitamin E, dietary fibre and fruit andvegetable intakes.METHODS: This prospective study included 44,039 participants aged ≥ 45 years fromthe NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-2017). Dietary data were collected using repeated24 h-dietary records. Multivariable Cox models were performed to characterizeassociations.RESULTS: SFA intake was associated with increased overall [n = 1722 cases,HRQ5vsQ1 = 1.44 (1.10-1.87), p-trend = 0.008] and breast [n = 545 cases,HRQ5vsQ1 = 1.98 (1.24-3.17), p-trend = 0.01] cancer risks. n-6 PUFA[HRQ5vsQ1 = 0.56 (0.32-0.97), p-trend = 0.01] and MUFA (HRQ5vsQ1 = 0.41[0.18-0.0.95), p-trend = 0.009] intakes were associated with a decreased risk of digestive cancers (n = 190 cases). Associations between n-6 PUFA,eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intakes and digestive cancer risk were modulated by dietary fibre, vitamin C and fruit and vegetableintakes.CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that SFA intake could increase overall andbreast cancer risks while some unsaturated fatty acids could decrease digestivecancer risk. However, in line with mechanistic hypotheses, our results suggestthat intakes of fruits and vegetables and their constituents (antioxidants,fibre) may interact with PUFAs to modulate these associations.DOI: 10.1007/s00394-018-1682-5 PMID: 29616321
