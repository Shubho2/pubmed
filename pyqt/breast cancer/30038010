It is known to exhibit anticancer properties via inhibiting theSTAT3 phosphorylation process. However, its poor water solubility and lowbioavailability impede its clinical application. Herein, we usedorganoplatinum(II) ‚Üê pyridyl coordination-driven self-assembly and acucurbit[8]uril (CB[8])-mediated heteroternary host-guest complex formation inconcert to produce an effective delivery system that transports Cur into thecancer cells. Specifically, a hexagon 1, containing hydrophilic methyl viologen(MV) units and 3,4,5-Tris[2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy]benzoyl groupsalternatively at the vertices, has been synthesized and characterized by several spectroscopic techniques. The MV units of 1 underwent noncovalent complexationwith CB[8] to yield a host-guest complex 4. Cur can be encapsulated in 4, via a1:1:1 heteroternary complex formation, resulting in a water-soluble host-guestcomplex 5. The host-guest complex 5 exhibited ca 100-fold improved IC50 valuesrelative to free Cur against human melanoma (C32), melanoma of rodents (B16F10), and hormone-responsive (MCF-7) and triple-negative (MDA-MB231) breast cancercells. Moreover, strong synergisms of Cur with 1 and 4 with combinatorial indexesof <1 across all of the cell lines were observed. An induced apoptosis withfragmented DNA pattern and inhibited expression of phosphor-STAT3 supported theimproved therapeutic potential of Cur in heteroternary complex 5.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1803800115 PMID: 30038010
