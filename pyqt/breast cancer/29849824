Ourresults confirmed the favorable diagnostic value of plasma mSEPT9 for CRC, with asensitivity of 61.22% (95% confidence interval (CI): 51.33%-70.27%) andspecificity of 93.7% (95% CI: 91.09%-95.57%) using 2/3 algorithm. The positiverate of mSEPT9 in CRC was correlated with tumor size, histological grade, andgeneral histological type (P < 0.05). Beyond CRC, gastric cancer patients alsopresented a high positive rate of plasma mSEPT9 (70%). The conversions betweenpreoperative and postoperative plasma mSEPT9 reflected the therapeutic efficacyof curatively intended surgery for CRC patients. The persistent positivity ofplasma mSEPT9 after surgery (within 7-14 days) was highly associated withimpending recurrences or metastases (within one year), with a sensitivity of100%. Postoperative mSEPT9 status during follow-up also provided valuableindication for CRC recurrence or metastases, with a good consistency(kappa = 0.818, P = 0.001). Our results verified the reliability of plasma mSEPT9as a biomarker for noninvasive diagnosis of CRC. More significantly, we revealed its valuable role in appraising CRC therapeutic efficacy and monitoring CRCrecurrences or metastases. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed toverify and elucidate the clinical utility of the promising findings.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6437104 PMCID: PMC5937566PMID: 29849824
