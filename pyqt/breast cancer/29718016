Clinical appearance can vary, but lesions often present as isolateddermal nodules with superficial discoloration or a change in texture on the chestipsilateral to the primary breast malignancy. We report the case of a woman with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast presenting with diffuse cutaneous noduleswith no surface changes. The nodules were almost undetectable clinically and had minimal elevation, making them difficult to detect, especially without palpation.A punch biopsy showed positive cytokeratin immunostaining consistent with themarkers for the primary breast cancer. A review of the literature on cutaneousmetastases from breast adenocarcinomas also is provided.PMID: 29718016
