Epub 2017 Dec 31.Involvement of Machine Learning for Breast Cancer Image Classification: A Survey.Nahid AA(1), Kong Y(1).Author information: (1)School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.Breast cancer is one of the largest causes of women's death in the world today.Advance engineering of natural image classification techniques and ArtificialIntelligence methods has largely been used for the breast-image classificationtask. The involvement of digital image classification allows the doctor and thephysicians a second opinion, and it saves the doctors' and physicians' time.Despite the various publications on breast image classification, very few review papers are available which provide a detailed description of breast cancer image classification techniques, feature extraction and selection procedures,classification measuring parameterizations, and image classification findings. Wehave put a special emphasis on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method for breast image classification. Along with the CNN method we have also described theinvolvement of the conventional Neural Network (NN), Logic Based classifiers suchas the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bayesianmethods, and a few of the semisupervised and unsupervised methods which have beenused for breast image classification.DOI: 10.1155/2017/3781951 PMCID: PMC5804413PMID: 29463985
