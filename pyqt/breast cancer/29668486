We utilized multivariable generalized estimating equation regression analysis to assess patient, clinical, and provider (year of graduation, urologistdensity) and facility (group vs. solo, academic/teaching status, for-profitstatus, distance to treatment facility) characteristics that predicted use of RP versus EBRT as well as quality of care outcomes.RESULTS: Multivariable analysis revealed that group (vs. solo) practice wasassociated with a decreased risk of RP (odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidenceinterval, 0.25-0.91). Among RP patients with low-risk disease, receipt of a bone scan that was not recommended was significantly predicted by race and insurancestatus. Surgical quality of care measures were associated with physician's yearof graduation and receiving care at a teaching facility.CONCLUSIONS: In addition to demographic factors, we found that provider andfacility characteristics were associated with treatment choice and specificquality of care measures. Long-term follow-up is required to determine whetherquality of care indicators are related to PCa outcomes.DOI: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000442 PMID: 29668486
