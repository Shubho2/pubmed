However, theirinhibitory action on HMG-CoA reductase also results in the depletion ofintermediate biosynthetic products, which importantly contribute to cellproliferation. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of theindividual commercially available statins on investigational breast cancer. Thus,in this study, biodegradable polymeric micelles as carrier of statins wereprepared using biodegradable copolymers (PCL-PEG-PCL). These nanoparticles wereprepared with two statins (atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) and drug loading,release, kinetic release, and anti-cancer activity of these drugs were studied.The triblock copolymer PCL-PEG-PCL was synthesized by a ring openingpolymerization of e-caprolactone in the presence of PEG as the initiator andSn(oct)2 as the catalyst. The synthesized copolymers and nanoparticles werecharacterized by FTIR, HNMR, GPC, DLS, and AFM analyses. The drug loading andrelease of drugs were studied by UV-Vis. Additionally, MTT assays on HFF-2 celllines were performed for determination of biocompatibility of micelles. Finally, the anticancer activity of micelles was studied on MCF-7 breast cancer celllines. The results showed that the average diameter of nanoparticles was lessthan 45 nm. The loading capacity of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin was20.0 ± 1.01% and 13.21 ± 1.18%, respectively, and encapsulation efficiency ofatorvastatin and rosuvastatin was 88.19 ± 1.11% and 69.32 ± 0.23%, respectively. The results showed strong and dose-dependent inhibition of cell (MCF-7line)growth by the nanoparticles compared with statins. The result of cell viabilityassay on the MCF-7 cell line verified that the bare nanoparticles showed littleinherent cytotoxicity whereas the statins-loaded nanoparticles were cytotoxic.DOI: 10.1080/10837450.2018.1474221 PMID: 29741465
