On the other hand, breast cancer is one of the most common cancersamong Iranian women. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigatethe effect of mindfulness-based training on psychological status and quality oflife (QoL) of patients with breast cancer living in Ilam, Iran. Thisquasi-experimental study was performed on 66 patients diagnosed with breastcancer. The patients assigned into two groups of experimental and control.Experimental group received mindfulness-based group training through eight 90-minsessions. Sessions were conducted twice a week and were completed within 1 month.The research tools included a QoL questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), Schneiderâ€™s lifeexpectancy questionnaire, and the depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21). The questionnaires were completed before and during the interviews with the patients 2 months after intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 16) andrunning descriptive and analytical statistics. Before the intervention, there wasno significant difference between he experimental and control groups considering QoL, life expectancy, depression, anxiety, and stress (p>0.05). However, afterthe intervention, the patients in the experimental group reported higher QoL and life expectancy and less severe depression, anxiety, and stress (p < 0.05).Considering the positive effect of mindfulness-based training on thepsychological status and QoL of patients with breast cancer, we recommend health nurses conduct mindfulness-based training for patients receiving clinical careservices.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.7.1993 PMID: 30051690
