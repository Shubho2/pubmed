Epub 2018Apr 18.Finding cancer in mammograms: if you know it's there, do you know where?Carrigan AJ(1)(2)(3), Wardle SG(1)(2), Rich AN(1)(2)(3).Author information: (1)1Perception in Action Research Centre & Department of Cognitive Science,Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.(2)2ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition & Its Disorders, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.(3)3Centre for Elite Performance, Expertise, and Training, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.Humans can extract considerable information from scenes, even when these arepresented extremely quickly. The ability of an experienced radiologist to rapidlydetect an abnormality on a mammogram may build upon this general capacity.Although radiologists have been shown to be able to detect an abnormality 'above chance' at short durations, the extent to which abnormalities can be localised atbrief presentations is less clear. Extending previous work, we presentedradiologists with unilateral mammograms, 50% containing a mass, for 250 or 1000ms. As the female breast varies with respect to the level of normalfibroglandular tissue, the images were categorised into high and low density (50%of each), resulting in difficult and easy searches, respectively. Participantswere asked to decide whether there was an abnormality (detection) and then tolocate the mass on a blank outline of the mammogram (localisation). We found bothdetection and localisation information for all conditions. Although there may be a dissociation between detection and localisation on a small proportion oftrials, we find a number of factors that lead to the underestimation oflocalisation including stimulus variability, response imprecision and participantguesses. We emphasise the importance of taking these factors into account wheninterpreting results. The effect of density on detection and localisationhighlights the importance of considering breast density in medical screening.DOI: 10.1186/s41235-018-0096-5 PMCID: PMC5904219PMID: 29707615
