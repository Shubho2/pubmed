The present study aimed toinvestigate the frequency and predictor value of skip metastasis in PTC patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 355 patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer whohad received a prior complete thyroidectomy with bilateral central neck andipsilateral lateral neck lymph node dissection were enrolled in this study. Theclinicopathological and ultrasound features were analyzed. A univariate andmultivariate analysis were performed to identify the risk factors of skipmetastasis. RESULTS The frequency of skip metastasis was 12.4% (44/355). The PTC patients with skip metastasis exhibited fewer lymph node metastasis, which wasmore commonly detected in tumor size ≤1 cm (OR 9.354; p=0.001; 95% confidenceinterval (CI) 1.865-26.735), tumors located in upper pole (OR 3.822; p<0.001; 95%CI 1.935-7.549), without a well-defined margin (OR 2.528; p=0.016; CI1.191-5.367), and extrathyroidal extension (OR 2.406; p=0.013; CI 1.691-4.367).CONCLUSIONS Skip metastasis was common in PTC. The PTC patients with a tumor size≤1.0 cm, located in the upper pole, without a well-defined margin andextrathyroidal extension should be carefully evaluated for skip metastasis.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.907357 PMCID: PMC5952804PMID: 29722351
