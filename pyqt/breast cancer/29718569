Present study reports GRP78-based design of novel anticanceragents using in-silico methods. As a first step toward the work, the interactionsbetween GRP78 and 15 known ligands were modeled by docking simulation. The dockedcomplex, GRP78-13, superior to other compounds with respect to its experimentalactivity and energy descriptors, was deduced into a structure-basedpharmacophore. This hypothesis was applied as a screening filter to Asinex andChemdiv databases. Finally, 23 hits were tested in vitro. Among these, VH1019 andVH1011 induced a concentration-dependent strong broad antiproliferative effect inglioma (U87-MG), breast cancer (MCF-7), and prostate cancer (DU-145) cell linesas compared to nontumorigenic control, neonatal foreskin fibroblast (HFF-1).These compounds showed preferential growth inhibition of cancer cells over normalcells. The acetohydrazide derivative VH1019 was identified as a potential newchemotype for GRP78 inhibitors with an IC50 of 12.7 μM in MCF-7.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.DOI: 10.1111/cbdd.13322 PMID: 29718569
