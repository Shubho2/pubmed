In various numbers, UBB remnants (entitled "solid cell nests", or SCNs) are found in thyroid glandsexamined histologically. However, despite the close embryological relationbetween the UBB and the superior parathyroid glands, intraparathyroidal SCNs haveto our knowledge not been previously reported. Here, we describe a patientpresenting with a papillary thyroid carcinoma with central and lateral lymph nodemetastases. Upon postoperative analysis, an unintentionally removed parathyroidgland was observed adjacent to the superior aspect of the right thyroid lobe.Within a 0.6 × 0.5-mm area of the parathyroid gland, solid nests composed ofepithelial cells with oval and slightly elongated nuclei were seen. The cellswere positive for p40, p63, and GATA3, but negative for PTH. The final diagnosis was a SCN entrapped within the parathyroid gland. Empirically, we have notpreviously observed SCNs within the parathyroid glands. To our knowledge, ourfinding thus constitutes a very unusual histological manifestation, and couldindicate an underlying aberrancy during embryogenesis given the close anatomical relationship between the UBB and the superior parathyroid glands.DOI: 10.1007/s12022-018-9539-2 PMID: 30003532
