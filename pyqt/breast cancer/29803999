Electronic address:niegj@nanoctr.cn.Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) plays fundamental roles in regulating angiogenesis,vascular development, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancercells. However, the therapeutic effect of NgBR blockade on tumor vasculature and malignancy is unknown, investigations on which requires an adequate deliverysystem for small interfering RNA against NgBR (NgBR siRNA). Here a surface chargeswitchable polymeric nanoparticle that was sensitive to the slightly acidic tumormicroenvironment was developed for steady delivery of NgBR siRNA to tumortissues. The nanoformulation was constructed by conjugating 2, 3-dimethylmaleicanhydride (DMMA) molecules to the surface amines of micelles formed by cationicco-polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)2-poly(ethylenimine) and subsequentabsorption of NgBR siRNAs. The nanoparticles remained negatively charged inphysiological condition and smartly converted to positive surface charge due totumor-acidity-activated shedding of DMMA. The charge conversion facilitatedcellular uptake of siRNAs and in turn efficiently depleted the expression of NgBRin tumor-bearing tissues. Silencing of NgBR suppressed endothelial cell migrationand tubule formation, and reverted the EMT process of breast cancer cells.Delivery of the nanoformulation to mice bearing orthotopic breast carcinomashowed no effect on tumor growth, but led to remarkable decrease of distantmetastasis by normalizing tumor vessels and suppressing the EMT of breast cancer cells. This study demonstrated that NgBR is a promising therapeutic target inabnormal tumor vasculature and aggressive cancer cells, and the tumor-responsive nanoparticle with the feature of charge transformation offers great potential fortumor-specific delivery of gene therapeutics.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
