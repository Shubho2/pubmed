However, the combined prognostic value of H19 and let-7asignature in breast cancer patients remains unclear.Methods: In this research we assessed the prognostic value of the combined H19and let-7a signature in breast cancer patients by retrospectively reviewing that data of 79 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy; we also investigated the expression and function of H19 in breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Survivaldata were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using thelog-rank test. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted usingthe Cox proportional hazards regression method. As determined using X-tile, theoptimal cutoff value for the risk score to assess progression-free survival (PFS)based on the combined signature was -0.1.Results: Patients with an overall positive treatment response had higher let-7aand lower H19 levels. In addition, let-7a expression was negatively correlatedwith H19 expression. Patients with a risk score of >-0.1 had shorter overallsurvival and PFS. In vitro data showed that chemoresistant cell lines exhibithigher H19 and lower let-7a levels and knockdown H19 restores paclitaxelsensitivity.Conclusion: Our results suggest that the combined let-7a and H19 signature is anovel prognostic factor for breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvantchemotherapy.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.142 PMCID: PMC6015984PMID: 29963109
