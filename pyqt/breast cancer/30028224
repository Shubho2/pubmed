The resulting multifunctional NPs were evaluated systematically in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanism of drug-resistancereversal was investigated.RESULTS: The NPs enhanced drug uptake in MCF-7/PDR cells by increasing drugsolubility and impairing P-glycoprotein efflux. Additionally, magnetic targeting and enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect enhanced drug accumulation in tumor, facilitating the chemotherapeutic and photodynamic therapy effects.Moreover, FSP-PTX-ZnPc NPs could penetrate the blood-brain barrier, a desirabletrait for brain disease therapy.CONCLUSION: The multifunctional FSP-PTX-ZnPc NPs are an effective tool forovercoming drug resistance in breast cancer.DOI: 10.2217/nnm-2017-0393 PMID: 30028224
