It also gives rise toaggregation during conjugation because of the hydrophobicity nature of thecytotoxin, DM1. The linker-drug in T-DM1, SMCC-DM1 is hydrophobic and requirescertain percentage of organic solvent such as DMA in the conjugation solution,limiting the manufacturing process in an organic-solvent-compatible device andadding extra costs. To address these problems, a site-specific conjugation methodwas developed involving full reduction of antibody and full conjugation with the bridge-like conjugator-drug, based on the work of Caddick and co-workers, toobtain a site-directed antibody-drug conjugate with DAR 4. The bridge-likeconjugator was assembled with SMCC-DM1 and different lengths of hydrophilicpolyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety. By applying PEG moiety in the side chain of thelinker-drug, the organic solvent used in the conjugation can be reduced. When thePEG length is about 26 units, organic solvent is no longer needed in theconjugation. Reducing the amount of organic solvent in conjugation could alsodiminish the aggregation occurrence during the conjugation. Moreover, theconjugation configuration with the designed conjugator was also discussed in the article. The binding affinity of the resulting ADCs did not show significantdecrease and the cell based assay and animal study have shown the comparableresults with T-DM1.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
