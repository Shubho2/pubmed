The characteristics of PTX/SPIO-SSL-H7K(R2)2 were evaluated. The targetingeffect, MRI, and antitumor activity of PTX/SPIO-SSL-H7K(R2)2 were investigateddetail in vitro and in vivo in human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cell models.Results: Our results of in vitro flow cytometry, in vivo imaging, and in vivo MR imaging confirmed the pH-responsive characteristic of H7K(R2)2 in MDA-MB-231 cellline in vitro and in vivo. The results of in vivo MRI and in vivo antitumoractivity confirmed the theranostic effect of PTX/SPIO-SSL-H7K(R2)2 in MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing model.Conclusion: Considering all our in vitro and in vivo results, we conclude that wedeveloped targeting modified theranostic liposome which could achieve both roleof antitumor and MRI.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S157082 PMCID: PMC5856286PMID: 29559778  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
