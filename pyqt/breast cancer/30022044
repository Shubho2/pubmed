EZH2 has been mainly studied as the catalytic component of thePolycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that mediates gene repression bytrimethylating histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). However, how EZH2 drivesmetastasis despite the low H3K27me3 levels observed in ER- breast cancer isunknown. Here we show that in human invasive carcinomas and distant metastases,cytoplasmic EZH2 phosphorylated at T367 is significantly associated withER- disease and low H3K27me3 levels. p38-mediated EZH2 phosphorylation at T367promotes EZH2 cytoplasmic localization and potentiates EZH2 binding to vinculinand other cytoskeletal regulators of cell migration and invasion. Ectopicexpression of a phospho-deficient T367A-EZH2 mutant is sufficient to inhibit EZH2cytoplasmic expression, disrupt binding to cytoskeletal regulators, and reduceEZH2-mediated adhesion, migration, invasion, and development of spontaneousmetastasis. These results point to a PRC2-independent non-canonical mechanism of EZH2 pro-metastatic function.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05078-8 PMCID: PMC6051995PMID: 30022044
