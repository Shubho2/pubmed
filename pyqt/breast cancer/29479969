Email: kalyan.ch@krisanibio.comBackground: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide.Tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is widely used in itstreatment. TAM is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes, includingCYP2D6, CYP3A5 and CYP2C19, whose genetic variations may have clinicopathologicalimportance. However, reports on the association of various P450 polymorphismswith certain cancers are contradictory. Methods: We here investigated whether theprevalence of the four most common polymorphism in the CYP2D6*4 (G1934A),CYP2D6*10 (C188T), CYP3A5*3 and CYP2C19*2 alleles has any link with breast cancerusing genomic DNA and polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment lengthpolymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Results: Prevalences of CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*10 andCYP2C19*2 genotypes were differed significantly (P = 0.01 and P = 0.004) between breast cancer patients and controls. The CYP3A5*3 genotype did not demonstratestatistically significant variation. Conclusion: Polymorphisms in CYP2 appear to be associated with breast cancer risk. Our data taken together with other reportsindicates that drug resistance gene polymorphisms might be indicators of responseto tamoxifen therapy in breast cancer cases.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.2.343 PMCID: PMC5980918PMID: 29479969
