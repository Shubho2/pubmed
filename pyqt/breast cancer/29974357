The sensitivity ofscreening is higher for women with low breast density than for women with highdensity. One may therefore ask whether single reading could replace doublereading at least for women with low density. We addressed this question usingdata from a screening program where the radiologists coded their readingsindependently.METHODS: Data include all screening mammography examinations in the CapitalRegion of Denmark from 1 November 2012 to 31 December 2013. Outcome of screening was assessed by linkage to the Danish Pathology Register. We calculatedsensitivity, specificity, number of interval cancers, and false positive-testsper 1000 screened women by both single reader and consensus BI-RADS density code.RESULTS: In total 54,808 women were included. The overall sensitivity of doublereading was 72%, specificity was 97.6%, 3 women per 1000 screened experienced an interval cancer, and 24 a false-positive test. Across all BI-RADS density codes, single reading consistently decreased sensitivity as compared with consensusreading. The same was true for specificity, apart from results across BI-RADSdensity codes set by reader 2.CONCLUSIONS: Single reading decreased sensitivity as compared with double readingacross all BI-RADS density codes. This included results based on consensusBI-RADS density codes. This means that replacement of double with single reading would have negative consequences for the screened women, even if density could beassessed automatically calibrated to the usual consensus level.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4864-1 PMID: 29974357
