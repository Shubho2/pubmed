However, the time between diagnosis andsurgery is rising, partly attributed to the added complexity of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR). We sought to investigate time to treatment and survivaloutcomes in breast cancer patients undergoing IBR.METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 2004-2014 California CancerRegistry data for stage 0-III breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy. Time to surgery, adjuvant systemic therapy and radiation therapy, propensity score,and covariate-adjusted overall mortality hazard ratios (HRs) were assessed by IBRstatus.RESULTS: Of 56,782 patients, 13,738 (24.2%) underwent IBR, with a medianfollow-up of 68.8 months. Median time between diagnosis and surgery was increasedfor patients undergoing IBR compared with those without {49 days (interquartilerange [IQR] 34-73) vs. 35 days (IQR 21-56), p < 0.001}. IBR did not affect theinterval from surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation, but prolonged timeto endocrine therapy by 5 days (p = 0.014). Significantly lower survival wasobserved when time to surgery exceeded 120 days (vs. 0-30 days; HR 1.14[1.02-1.28], p = 0.023), and improved survival with IBR (vs. without; HR 0.67[0.61-0.74], p < 0.001). The benefit associated with reconstruction persisted forall age groups except age 80 + years, while surgical delay > 120 daysdemonstrated significantly lower survival in women < 60 years of age.CONCLUSIONS: While IBR delays time to definitive surgery, its use did notsubstantially affect time to adjuvant treatment or survival outcomes. Furtherresearch is ongoing to mitigate the effects of potential selection bias in favor of IBR.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6663-7 PMID: 30014454
