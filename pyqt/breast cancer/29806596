Ziauddin Hospital and University, Karachi,Pakistan.Background/Aim: Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortalityworldwide. Human epidermal growth factor (Her-2/neu) has shown strong therapeuticimplication in breast cancer. Although the prevalence of Her-2/neuover-expression in gastric cancer has been reported across the world, it is stillunknown from South Asia. The aim of this study is to evaluate Her-2/neuexpression in gastric adenocarcinomas and to correlate with variousclinicopathological variables.Patients and Methods: A total of 95 consecutive patients undergoing endoscopicbiopsy or gastrectomy were recruited in this study. Clinicopathologicalparameters of all patients were recorded and hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)staining was performed. Over-expression of Her-2/neu was investigated byimmunohistochemistry using Î±-Her-2 antibody. To quantify Her-2/neuover-expression, the Hofmann validation scoring system was used and further itsassociation was seen with age, gender, histopathological type, grade, and stageof the tumor. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 21. A P value of <0.05 was considered as significant.Results: Overall, 21 (22.1%) cases were positive for Her-2/neu overexpressionfrom the total of 95 gastric adenocarcinomas. Her-2/neu was significantlyexpressed in low-grade gastric cancer (grade I = 50%, grade II = 34.5%, grade III= 14.5%; P = 0.030). Although there was insignificant difference betweenHer-2/neu over expression and other variables, Her-2/neu score 3+ waspredominantly seen in females, age >60 years, Laurens intestinal type, and IIICstage tumors.Conclusion: Her-2/neu is over-expressed in a limited group of gastric cancerpatients in our population and indicates a significant strong association withlow grades of gastric cancer.PMID: 29806596
