All patients receivedintraoperative frozen-section analysis for initial margin assessment. We usedunivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to screen forpredictors. A nomogram was developed in the training cohort (n=1,193) from thesouth branch of the hospital and externally validated in the validation cohort(n=499) from the north branch. We used the area under the receiver-operatingcharacteristic curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow tests to assess the discrimination andaccuracy of the nomogram.Results: The initial margin-positivity rates were 19.5% and 25.2% in the trainingand validation cohorts, respectively. Preoperative tumor size, preoperativelymph-node status, suspicion of multifocality, hormone-receptor status, and HER2 status were significantly associated with margin status. The model included thesefive variables. The discrimination and calibration of the model were consideredacceptable in both cohorts.Conclusion: The nomogram can predict the likelihood of having positive initialmargins during BCS and may be useful for clinical decision-making in the surgicaltreatment of breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S160433 PMCID: PMC5951222PMID: 29780255
