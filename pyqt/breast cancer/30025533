Patients were classified as < 30 years old (group 1),30-60 years old (group 2), and > 60 years old (group 3). The three age groupswere compared regarding clinical and baseline characteristics.RESULTS: Overall, 564 individuals entered group 1, 4519 group 2, and 670 group 3.Group 1 had lower rates of tumor necrosis (p < 0.001), higher lymphatic orvascular invasion (p = 0.002), estrogen receptor-negative individuals, andHER2-positive individuals (p ≤ 0.001). Younger groups had more stage 3 BC (31.1, 25.6, and 19.7% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) (p = 0.016), grade 3 BC(27.4, 20.6, and 16.5% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) (p = 0.001), andgrade 3 nucleus (43.1, 34.5, and 27.6% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively)(p < 0.001). Group 1 had higher rates of regional metastasis (4.7 vs. 1.5 and2.1% for groups 2 and 3, respectively). Younger individuals had higher rates ofbrain metastasis (13.3, 5.4, and 1.1% for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively).Moreover, those > 60 years old had more lung metastasis (33 vs. 12.6 and 6.7% forgroups 2 and 1, respectively) (p < 0.001). Younger groups had more < 5-yearrecurrence (16.3, 11.7, and 8.9%, for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively)(p = 0.023).CONCLUSION: Pattern and site of recurrence changes according to age in BC. Thisbrings up the question whether age is an independent predictor of organ ofmetastasis or is site of metastasis the result of other clinicopathologicaldeterminants which differ between age groups.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1435-1 PMCID: PMC6053760PMID: 30025533
