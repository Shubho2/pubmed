Hospital, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India.Purpose: Leser-Trélat syndrome consists of appearance of a solid tumor-likecarcinoma breast, colon, or stomach following eruption of multiple seborrheickeratoses (SK) of the skin. We present an unusual and possibly the first casereport of Leser-Trélat syndrome in a male patient with a history of mastectomyfor breast carcinoma who presented to us with a second malignancy in the form of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the lower eyelid.Procedure: A 75-year-old male presented in 2014 with a history of modifiedradical mastectomy for infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast which wasperformed 11 years prior to the day of presentation. Breast carcinoma wasdiagnosed following eruption of multiple SK at the same time. In the previous 3years he noted a nodulo-ulcerative growth over the lateral aspect of the rightlower eyelid which was clinically diagnosed as BCC. Mass excision under frozensection control and lid reconstruction was performed. Diagnosis of BCC wasconfirmed on histopathological examination of the excised specimen.Results and Conclusions: Though a previously unobserved entity, our case supportsthe importance of Leser-Trélat sign and its relevance to affected individuals, asearly recognition and prompt treatment of a low-stage cancer offers goodprognosis.DOI: 10.1159/000481354 PMCID: PMC5939681 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29765947
