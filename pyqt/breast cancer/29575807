University of Baroda,Vadodara, India.Herein we report design, synthesis, and anticancer activity of compounds 6a-h and11a-j. Compounds 6a-f were designed based on 3-aminomethyl pyridine attached todifferent acetamide derivatives and in compounds 6g-h it was attached to coumarinmoiety. Coumarin containing compounds 6g-h showed very poor anticancer activityagainst both A549 (Lungs cancer cell line), and MCF-7 (Breast cancer cell line)cell lines in MTT assay. Compounds 11a-j were designed as derivatives of3-aminomethyl pyridine and 4-amino chalcones. A series of chalcone derivatives of3-aminomethyl pyridine 11a-j have been synthesized and screened for their invitro anticancer activity and DNA binding affinity. Most of the compounds showed very good antimitotic activity against A549 cell line as compared tofluorouracil. Compounds 11g and 11i were selected for DNA-binding studies as theyshowed excellent activity against cancer cell lines in MTT assay. CT-DNA binding affinity of compounds 11g and 11i have been investigated by UV based DNAtitration and fluorescence emission study against DNA-EtBr complex.Interestingly, compound 11i has displayed excellent antiproliferative activity,with IC50 0.0067 ± 0.0002 μm, against MCF-7 cell line. Compound 11i has beenstudied for its cytotoxicity using MTT, LDH, as well as EtBr/AO assay and wasfound to induce apoptosis in the cancerous cell line.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.DOI: 10.1111/cbdd.13189 PMID: 29575807
