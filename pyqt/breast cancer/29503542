AgNPshave been used in vitro for treatment of various diseases, such as hepatitis Band herpes simplex infections as well as colon, cervical, and lung cancers. Inthis study, we assessed the effect on proliferation, adhesion, and apoptosis inbreast cancer cell lines of different molecular profiles (MCF7, HCC1954, andHCC70) exposed to AgNPs (2-9 nm).Methods: Breast cancer cell lines were incubated in vitro; MTT assay was used to assess proliferation. Adhesion was determined by real-time analysis with thexCELLingence system. Propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin Vassay were used to measure apoptosis. The transcriptome was assessed by geneexpression microarray and Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) analyses.Results: The results showed a decreased adhesion in breast cancer cell lines and the control exposed to AgNPs was noted in 24 hours (p≤0.05). We observed asignificant reduction in the proliferation of MCF7 and HCC70, but not in HCC1954.Apoptotic activity was seen in all cell lines exposed to AgNPs, with an apoptosispercentage of more than 60% in cancer cell lines and less than 60% in thecontrol. PGM analysis confirmed, to some extent, the effects of AgNPs primarilyon adhesion by changes in the extracellular matrix.Conclusion: Exposure to AgNPs causes an antiproliferative, apoptotic, andanti-adhesive effect in breast cancer cell lines cultured in vitro. More researchis needed to evaluate the potential use of AgNPs to treat different molecularprofiles of breast cancer in humans.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S152237 PMCID: PMC5826086PMID: 29503542  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
