We analyzed the variability andmedian of waiting times from when a patient seeks care to first treatment for the4 most prevalent cancer types in Ontario.METHODS: Using retrospective health administrative data, we identified patientswith a new diagnosis of prostate, breast, lung or colorectal cancer in Ontariobetween 2002 and 2012. Treatment interventions were categorized as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery. We used regression analyses to calculate trends for the coefficient of variation, the Gini coefficient and the median waiting time foreach cancer type-treatment type pair over the study period.RESULTS: During the study period, 95 501 new cases of prostate cancer, 89 244breast cancer cases, 82 604 lung cancer cases and 80 761 colorectal cancer cases were registered. The coefficient of variation and the Gini coefficient of waitingtimes decreased for all cancer type-treatment type pairs (except for the Ginicoefficient for breast cancer-radiotherapy) over the study period. However, both decreasing and increasing trends in median waiting times were observed acrosscancer type-treatment type pairs.INTERPRETATION: The variability of waiting time to first treatment for patientswith prostate, breast, lung or colorectal cancer decreased between 2002 and 2012,which indicates improvements in equity in access to cancer care. This trendaligns with provincial efforts to improve access to and the efficiency of cancer care treatment in Ontario. The lack of consistent decreases in median waitingtime highlights the need to identify improvement opportunities for cancertype-treatment type pairs with increasing median waiting times.Copyright 2018, Joule Inc. or its licensors.DOI: 10.9778/cmajo.20170118 PMID: 29880658
