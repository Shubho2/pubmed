[Epub ahead of print]Synthesis, thymidine phosphorylase inhibitory and computational study of novel1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thione derivatives as potential anticancer agents.Bajaj S(1), Roy PP(1), Singh J(2).Author information: (1)SLT Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya, ACentral University, Bilaspur, 495009, Chhattisgarh, India, India.(2)SLT Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya, ACentral University, Bilaspur, 495009, Chhattisgarh, India, India. Electronicaddress: jagadishpharm09@gmail.com.A series of novel 1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thione derivatives were designed,synthesized and evaluated for in vitro anticancer activity against breast cancer (MCF-7) cell line and thymidine phosphorylase. The synthesis of target compounds was performed by cyclization reaction using aromatic amines and carbon disulphideto get mannich bases. The synthesized compound 2j exhibited the most potentanticancer activity against MCF-7 cell line. Compounds 2d, 2j, 2o and 2h showedpotent thymidine phosphorylase inhibitory activity. The SAR study revealed thatthe substitution of phenyl ring with electron withdrawing group at R1 positionand less bulky amines group at R2 position of 1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thione ringshowed significant growth inhibitory activity. Further in silico ADMET propertiesof synthesized compounds were calculated along with molecular docking to studythe binding mode of the compounds in the active site of thymidine phosphorylase(TP). The molecular docking studies showed that amines group have good bindinginteraction on active site residues of TP such as compounds 2j and 2o exhibitedhydrogen bond interaction with amino acid residues GLY152, THR151 and HIS116 ofthymidine phosphorylase (PDB ID: 1UOU). The result of biological activity anddocking study revealed that amines group at R2 point of 1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thionemoiety is essential for anticancer activity.Copyright Â© 2018.
