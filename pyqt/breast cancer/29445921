It typically presents as a late seroma-containingatypical, monoclonal T cells which are CD30+ and anaplastic lymphoma kinasenegative. Until recently, it was thought that the disease was very rare. However,it is being diagnosed increasingly frequently with 56 cases confirmed inAustralia by September 2017 and the estimated incidence revised from 1 in 300,000to between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10,000 patients with bilateral implants. There isdebate about the spectrum of BIA-ALCL. According to the current WHOclassification, BIA-ALCL is a cancer in all cases. Treatment guidelines requirethat it is treated urgently with a minimum of bilateral removal of implants andcapsulectomies. Whilst acknowledging the disease has been under diagnosed in the past, with some notable exceptions the BIA-ALCL literature has given scantattention to the epidemiological evidence. Now that it is known that the disease may occur in up to 1 in 1000 patients with a median of 7.5Â years fromimplantation to diagnosis, understanding it in its epidemiological context isimperative. The epidemiology of cancer and lymphoma in women with breast implantsstrongly suggests that most patients do not have a cancer that will inevitablyprogress without treatment but instead a self-limiting lympho-proliferativedisorder. Although the possibility of spontaneous regression has been raised and the observation made that treatment delay did not seem to increase the risk ofspread, the main objection to the lympho-proliferative hypothesis has been thelack of documented cases of spontaneous regression or resolution. Because allcases currently are considered malignant and treated urgently, only case reportevidence, interpreted in the proper epidemiological context, is likely to beavailable to challenge this thinking.METHODS AND RESULTS: New observations and interpretation of the epidemiology ofBIA-ALCL are made. These are supported by the presentation of two cases, which tothe best of our knowledge comprise the first documented evidence of spontaneousregression and spontaneous resolution of confirmed BIA-ALCL.CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of the disease strongly suggests that the vastmajority of cases are not a cancer that will inevitably progress withouttreatment. The findings presented in the manuscript provide supportive clinicalevidence. Consequently, an alternative view of BIA-ALCL with implications forresearch, diagnosis and clinical management needs to be considered.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level ofevidence to each article.
