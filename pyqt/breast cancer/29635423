We hypothesized that a higher baseline rate of employment amongcancer patients may explain the lack of association between a cancer diagnosisand later unemployment in many studies.Aims: To assess the unemployment rate among cancer patients before diagnosiscompared with a matched cancer-free control group.Methods: Using data from the Israeli National Central Bureau of Statistics 1995census (persons aged between 15 and 60 years old), the Israeli Tax Authoritydatabase and the Israel Cancer Registry, cancer patients (diagnosed between theyears 2000 and 2007 and alive at 2011) were compared with matched cancer-freecontrols.Results: There were 8797 cancer patients and 26166 cancer-free controls. We foundthat, in general, cancer was not associated with unemployment 2 years beforediagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]0.90-1.009, P = NS) after adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, educationalyears and residential socioeconomic position. However, the diagnoses associatedwith screening (breast, prostate, colorectal and cervix cancers) were inverselyassociated with unemployment 2 years before diagnosis (adjusted OR = 0.90, 95% CI0.84-0.97, P < 0.01).Conclusions: The results from the current study suggest that a higher baselinerate of employment among cancer patients, mainly those who were diagnosed withscreening-associated cancers, explains false negative results in previous studiesassessing cancer survivors' work issues.DOI: 10.1093/occmed/kqy055 PMID: 29635423
