[Epub ahead ofprint]Controllable Aggregation-Induced Exocytosis Inhibition (CAIEI) of PlasmonicNanoparticles in Cancer Cells Regulated by MicroRNA.Qian RC, Lv J, Long YT.Recent advances of nanotechnology have produced plenty of intracellular drugdelivery systems based on various functional nanoparticles. Although muchprogress has been achieved in improving the cellular uptake efficiency, theretention time of these engineered nanoparticles in living cells has not yetreceived wide attentions. Here, we report the controllable exocytosis ofplasmonic gold nanoparticles (GNPs) based on a microRNA-21 (miRNA-21) targetedbinary system. Rapid intracellular accumulation of GNPs was observed in miRNA-21 positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which blocked the exocytosis of the GNPaggregates. Under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, MCF-7 cells were successfully killed due to the far-red and NIR absorption of the GNP aggregates. In contrast, in miRNA-21 negative cells, the dispersive GNPs escaped from the cells after 6 h.The traces of GNPs could be conveniently captured under the dark fieldmicroscope. This work provides a promising platform for the study of controllableaggregation-induced exocytosis inhibition (CAIEI) of nanocarriers, which isinspiring for the design of more effective nanodrugs for the treatment of cancer.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00465 PMID: 30059228
