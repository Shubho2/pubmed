Raeusch. (IMP) aerial part ethyl acetate extract hasanti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and pro-oxidative effects towards colorectalcancer in vitro. The chemical constituents of IMP aerial part ethyl acetateextract were isolated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) andidentified with tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) in combination withultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and 400 MHz NMR. The growth inhibitoryeffects of each identified component on BT-549 (breast) and HT-29 (colon) cancer cell lines were evaluated after 48/72 h treatment by MTT assay. Four isolatedcompounds were identified as trans-p-Coumaric acid (1); 2-Methoxyestrone (2); 11,16-Dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3, 20-dione (3); and Tricin (4). Compounds (2), (3), and (4) exhibited considerable growth inhibitory activities against BT-549 and HT-29 cancer cell lines. Compounds (2), (3), and (4) are potential candidates for novelanti-cancer agents against breast and colorectal cancers.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23071807 PMID: 30037062
