For L. robustum-treated Hela cells, early or late apoptosis were evaluated by annexin V/PI staining. Mitochondrial membranepotential was measured by staining cells with JC-1. Apoptosis was monitored bynuclear morphology based on chromatin condensation and fragmentation by4',6-diamidino-2-phenylinole (DAPI) staining. Caspase-3 and -8 activity levelswere measured by a colorimetric assay. In vivo, to evaluate the possiblemechanism of L. robustum-mediated antitumor effect, nude mouse xenograft studywas also conducted.RESULTS: In in vitro study, L. robustum was found to be toxic to HeLa, MCF-7,PC-3, 7721, SW480, with an half maximal inhibitory concentration value of 2-5mg/mL (P<0.05). Moreover, externalization of phosphatidylserine, loss ofmitochondrial membrane potential, DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3and -8 were detected in L. robustum-treated Hela cells. Using a nude mouse model bearing Hela xenografts, we found that L. robustum reduced tumor volume and tumorweight (P<0.05), but had no effect on body weight and histological damage ofimportant organs. Intraperitoneal injection of L. robustum caused a significantreduction in serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels(P<0.05). Furthermore, cleaved caspase-3-positive and terminal nucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were observed in L.robustum-treated tumor tissues.CONCLUSIONS: L. robustum inhibits tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis in a caspase-dependent way without apparent hepatic toxicityand histological damage, which may offer partial scientific support for theethnopharmacological claims of L. robustum as a herbal tea for its antitumoractivity.DOI: 10.1007/s11655-018-2983-5 PMID: 29790063
