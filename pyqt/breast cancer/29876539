Resveratrol has been shown to reverse As2O3-induced oxidative damage. In immortalized but nontransformed estrogen receptor α-negative human breastcells (MCF10A), we observed that 25 μM resveratrol ameliorated As2O3-inducedcytotoxicity. As2O3, in the presence or absence of 25 μM resveratrol, inducedquinone reductase (NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1), via the induction ofNFE2-related factor 2. As2O3 caused a repression of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1B1, butthe addition of 25 μM resveratrol rescued the expression of cytochrome P450 1B1and kept it at a constant level. Therefore, 25 μM resveratrol can modulate theeffects of As2O3 on enzymes involved in estrogen metabolism.DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b01727 PMCID: PMC5981766PMID: 29876539
