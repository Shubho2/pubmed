Post-ablationmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was compared with surgical pathology inevaluation of residual post-ablation IDC and ductal carcinoma in situ.METHODS: Patients with a single focus of IDC 20 mm or smaller by pre-ablation MRIwere treated with PLA. The patients underwent a 28-day post-ablation MRI,followed by surgical resection. Cell viability criteria were applied to pre- and post-ablation pathology specimens, which evaluated hematoxylin-eosin (H&E),cytokeratin (CK) 8/18, estrogen receptor, and Ki67 staining patterns.RESULTS: In this study, 61 patients were reported as the intention-to-treatcohort for determination of PLA efficacy. Of these 61 patients, 51 (84%) hadcomplete tumor ablation confirmed by pathology analysis. One subject's MRIimaging was not performed per protocol, which left 60 subjects evaluable for MRI pathology correlation. Five patients (8.3%) had residual IDC shown by both MRIand pathology. Post-ablation discordance was noted between MRI and pathology,with four patients (6.7%) false-positive and four patients (6.7%) false-negative.The negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI for all the patients was 92.2% (95%confidence interval [CI], 71.9-91.9%). Of the 47 patients (97.9%) with tumors15 mm or smaller, 46 were completely ablated, with an MRI NPV of 97.7% (95% CI,86.2-99.9%).CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous laser ablation is a potential alternative to surgeryfor treatment of early-stage IDC. Strong correlations exist between post-ablationMRI and pathologic alterations in CK8/18, ER, and Ki67 staining.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6623-2 PMID: 29987603
