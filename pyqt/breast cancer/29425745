Underexpression of ZBTB4 iscorrelated with poor survival of breast cancer patients. However, the expression of ZBTB4 and its possible function remain unknown in Ewing sarcoma (ES). Toclarify these issues, we investigated the expression difference between ES andnormal tissues based on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data from R2: GenomicsAnalysis and Visualization Platform (http://r2.amc.nl). GEO data (GSE68776)indicated that the expression of ZBTB4 in ES tissues was prominently lowercompare to normal tissues. Our data further confirmed the underexpression ofZBTB4 in ES tissues. GEO data (GSE63157 and GSE17679) demonstrated that ZBTB4underexpression predicted a obvious shorter overall survival and event-freesurvival of ES patients. Interestingly, the expression of ZBTB4 was inverselycorrelated with proliferation makers Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen(PCNA) in ES tissues. In vitro, ZBTB4 overexpression inhibited cellproliferation, and induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and apoptosis in SK-ES-1and RD-ES cells. Moreover, ZBTB4 restoration suppressed the tumor growth of ES inmice. An inversely correlation between ZBTB4 and Survivin expression was observedin ES tissues. ZBTB4 overexpression reduced Survivin abundance in ES cells.Notably, Survivin restoration reversed the regulatory effect of ZBTB4 on ES cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. To conclude, our dataindicated that ZBTB4 exhibited a tumor suppressive role in ES possibly byreducing Survivin expression. ZBTB4/Survivin axis might serve as a therapeutictarget for ES.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.biopha.2018.01.132 PMID: 29425745
