One such mechanism involves the overexpression of ABC transporters that facilitate the extrusion of a variety of structurallydistinct chemotherapy drugs from the cytoplasm into the extracellular space.While specific ABC transporter inhibitors have been developed, many affect other ABC transporters, particularly at elevated concentrations. It is also unclearwhether they show clear efficacy for combatting drug resistance in cancerpatients with minimal host toxicity. In this study, we demonstrate the ability oftwo bile acids [β-cholanic acid (urso-cholanic acid) and deoxycholic acid] tospecifically inhibit ABCC1-mediated drug transport, augmenting doxorubicinaccumulation in breast and lung tumour cells selected for doxorubicin resistance through overexpression of the ABCC1 (but not ABCB1) drug transporter. The bileacids could also restore uptake and sensitivity to doxorubicin in humanendothelial kidney cells genetically engineered to overexpress the ABCC1 drugtransporter. These observations suggest a previously unreported role for bileacids as ABCC1 inhibitors or regulators. Given its additional properties ofminimal clinical toxicity in humans and its ability to inhibit aldo-ketoreductases involved in anthracycline resistance and anthracycline-inducedcardiotoxicity, β-cholanic acid merits further in vivo and clinicalinvestigation.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-23496-y PMCID: PMC5882947PMID: 29615646
