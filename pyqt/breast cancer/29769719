Deregulation of mTORC1 has been linked with metabolic diseases, cancer and ageing2-4. In response to amino acids, mTORC1 is recruited by the Rag GTPasesto the lysosome, its site of activation5,6. The GATOR1 complex, consisting ofDEPDC5, NPRL3 and NPRL2, displays GAP activity to inactivate Rag GTPases underamino-acid-deficient conditions 7 . However, it is unclear how the inhibitoryfunction of GATOR1 is releasedÂ upon amino acid stimulation. Here we find that in response to amino acids, the CUL3-KLHL22 E3 ubiquitin ligase promotes K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of DEPDC5, an essential subunit of GATOR1.KLHL22 plays a conserved role to mediate the activation of mTORC1 and downstream events in mammals and nematodes. Depletion of MEL-26, the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue of KLHL22, extends worm lifespan. Moreover, KLHL22 levels are elevatedin tumours of breast cancer patients, whereas DEPDC5 levels are correspondinglyreduced. Depletion of KLHL22 in breast cancer cells suppresses tumour growth innude mice. Therefore, pharmacological interventions targeting KLHL22 may havetherapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer and age-relateddiseases.DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0128-9 PMID: 29769719
