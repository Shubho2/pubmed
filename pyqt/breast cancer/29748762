We performed anelectronic medical record review for a cohort of women with American JointCommittee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage I or II invasive breast cancer treated withbreast conservation therapy who developed subsequent in-breast treatmentrecurrence (IBTR) or contralateral breast cancer (CBC). Poor surveillance outcomewas defined as second breast cancer not detected by surveillance mammography,including interval cancers (diagnosed within 365 days of surveillance mammogramwith negative results) and clinically detected cancers (diagnosed without asurveillance mammogram in the preceding 365 days). Univariate and multivariatelogistic regression were performed to identify predictors of poor mammographysurveillance outcome, including patient and primary tumor characteristics, breastdensity, mode of primary tumor detection, and time to second cancer diagnosis.RESULTS: 164 women met inclusion criteria (65 with IBTR, 99 with CBC); 124 hadscreen-detected second cancers. On univariate analysis, poor surveillance outcome(n = 40) was associated with age at primary cancer diagnosis < 50 years(p < 0.0001), AJCC stage II primary cancers (p = 0.007), and heterogeneously orextremely dense breasts (p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, age < 50 years atprimary breast cancer diagnosis remained a significant predictor of poorsurveillance outcome (p = 0.001).CONCLUSION: Women younger than age 50 at primary breast cancer diagnosis are atrisk of poor surveillance mammography outcomes, and may be appropriate candidatesfor more intensive clinical and imaging surveillance.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4808-9 PMID: 29748762
