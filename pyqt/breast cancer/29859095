Numerous studies have focused onepidemiological and health policy dynamics essentially underestimating thedetermining factors that shape people's choices and cues to health care serviceuptake. The study sought to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and health seekingbehavior towards breast cancer and its screening in a quest to explain why women present for prognosis and treatment when symptomatic pointers are in advancedstages, impeding primary prevention strategies.METHODS: Eight focus groups (6-10 members per group) and four key informantinterviews were conducted among adult participants from rural and urban settings.Sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. A thematic analysis of the data wasbased on the concepts of the health belief model. Data analysis was conductedusing NVIVO10.RESULTS: Most women perceived breast cancer as a fatal disease and conveyed fear of having early screening. Rural women preferred self-prescribed medications and the use of alternative medicine for long periods before presenting forprofessional care on suspicion that the lump is cancerous. Accessibility toequipped health facilities, lack of information to establish effective follow-up treatment and low-income status were underscored as their major health seekingbehavior barriers whereas, urban women identified marital status as their mainbarrier. Key informant interviews revealed that health communication programsemphasized more on communicable diseases. This could in part explain why there isa high rate of misconception and suspicion about breast cancer among rural andurban women in the study setting.CONCLUSIONS: Creating breast cancer awareness alongside clear guidelines onaccessing screening and treatment infrastructure is critical. It was evident, adiagnosis of breast cancer or lump brings unexpected confrontation withmortality; fear, pain, cultural barriers, emotional and financial distress.Without clear referral channels to enable those with suspicious lumps or earlystage disease to get prompt diagnosis and treatment, then well-meaning awareness will not necessarily contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality.DOI: 10.1186/s12905-018-0571-7 PMCID: PMC5984781PMID: 29859095
