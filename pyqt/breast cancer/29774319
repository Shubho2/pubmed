Sociodemographic and Clinical Data CollectionForm designed by us, Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Anxiety Scale (BAS),Beck Depression Scale (BDS), Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) and Quality ofLife Scale-Short Form (SF-36) were administered to patients and to control group.Results: The patients with breast cancer were found to indicate higher levels of anxiety and depression, lower levels of quality of life, and higher scores ofpersonality inventory subscales as compared to the healthy control group. In the patient group, it was identified that the quality of life subscale scores werefound to be negatively correlated with anxiety, depression, hopelessness andneurotic personality scores; there was a positive correlation between neuroticpersonality scores and depression, anxiety and hopelessness scores.Conclusions: It can be concluded that the breast cancer patients withextraversion personality traits have lower levels of anxiety and depression,keeping their quality of life better, whereas the patients with higherneuroticism scores may have more impaired quality of life. Therefore, thepsychiatric evaluation of the breast cancer patients during and after thetreatment cannot be ruled out.DOI: 10.5152/ejbh.2018.3724 PMCID: PMC5939973PMID: 29774319
