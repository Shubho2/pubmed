Here, we performed further analyses to determine whether let-7d isfunctionally linked to Jab1 in breast cancer.METHODS: In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses were used todetermine the level of let-7d and Jab1 in breast cancer clinical specimens andits correlation with clinicopathological data. Let-7d overexpressing breastcancer cell lines combined with mouse models bearing cell-derived xenografts wereused to assess the functional role of let-7d both in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: In this study, we found that let-7d was downregulated in breast cancertissues, coupled with the elevations of Jab1 protein expressions, compared withpaired adjacent noncancerous breast tissues. Let-7d overexpression significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasion in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Dualluciferase reporter assay indicated that Jab1 was the direct target of let-7d.Stepwise studies from in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that let-7doverexpression inhibited cell growth and decreased Jab1 expressions in breastcancer cells and nude mice tumor tissues. Statistical analyses demonstrated that breast cancer patients with low levels of let-7d or high levels of Jab1 had asignificant correlation with worse prognosis.CONCLUSION: These findings provide novel insights into molecular mechanism oflet-7d and Jab1 in tumor development and progression of breast cancer, and thuslet-7d/Jab1 are novel potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer patients.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
