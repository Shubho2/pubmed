Thus, a validated protocol for SVF isolation,freezing, and thawing is required to manage product administration. To complywith Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), fetal bovine serum (FBS), used to expand ASC in vitro, could be replaced by growth factors from platelet concentrates.METHODS: Throughout each protocol, GMP-compliant reagents and devices were used. SVF cells were isolated from lipoaspirates by a standardized enzymatic protocol. Cells were cryopreserved in solutions containing different albumin or serum anddimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) concentrations. Before and after cryopreservation, weanalyzed: cell viability (by Trypan blue); immunophenotype (by flow cytometry);colony-forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) formation; and differentiation potential. ASC, seeded at different densities, were expanded in presence of 10% FBS or 5%supernatant rich in growth factors (SRGF) from platelets. The differentiationpotential and cell transformation grade were tested in expanded ASC.RESULTS: We demonstrated that SVF can be obtained with a consistent yield (about 185 × 103 cells/ml lipoaspirate) and viability (about 82%). Lipoaspiratemanipulation after overnight storage at +4 °C reduced cell viability (-11.6%).The relative abundance of ASC (CD34+CD45-CD31-) and endothelial precursors(CD34+CD45-CD31+) in the SVF product was about 59% and 42%, respectively. Aperiod of 2 months cryostorage in autologous serum with added DMSO minimallyaffected post-thaw SVF cell viability as well as clonogenic and differentiationpotentials. Viability was negatively affected when SVF was frozen at a cellconcentration below 1.3 × 106 cells/ml. Cell viability was not significantlyaffected after a freezing period of 1 year. Independent of seeding density, ASCcultured in 5% SRGF exhibited higher growth rates when compared with 10% FBS. ASCexpanded in both media showed unaltered identity (by flow cytometry) and wereexempt from genetic lesions. Both 5% SRGF- and 10% FBS-expanded ASC efficientlydifferentiated to adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes.CONCLUSIONS: This paper reports a GMP-compliant approach for freezing SVF cellsisolated from adipose tissue by a standardized protocol. Moreover, an ASCexpansion method in controlled culture conditions and without involvement ofanimal-derived additives was reported.DOI: 10.1186/s13287-018-0886-1 PMCID: PMC5948766PMID: 29751821
