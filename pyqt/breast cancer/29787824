Electronic address: ascorilas@biol.uoa.gr.The human SR-related CTD associated factor 1 (SCAF1) gene is a new member of the human SR (Ser/Arg-rich) superfamily of pre-mRNA splicing factors, which has been discovered and cloned by members of our lab. SCAF1 interacts with the CTD domain of the RNA polymerase II polypeptide A and is firmly involved in pre-mRNAsplicing. Although it was found to be expressed widely in multiple human tissues,its mRNA levels vary a lot. The significant relation of SCAF1 with cancer hasbeen confirmed by many studies, since SCAF1 mRNA transcript was found to beoverexpressed in breast and ovarian tumors, confirming its significant prognosticvalue as a cancer biomarker in both these human malignancies. In this study, wedescribe the discovery and cloning of fifteen novel transcripts of the humanSCAF1 gene (SCAF1 v.2 - v.16), using nested PCR and NGS technology. In detail,extensive bioinformatic analysis revealed that these novel SCAF1 splice variants comprise a total of nine novel alternative splicing events between the annotated exons of the gene, thus producing seven novel SCAF1 transcripts with open-readingframes, which are predicted to encode novel SCAF1 isoforms and eight novel SCAF1 transcripts with premature termination codons that are likely long non-codingRNAs. Additionally, a novel 3' UTR was discovered and cloned using nested 3' RACEand was validated with Sanger sequencing. In order to validate the NGS findingsas well as to investigate the expression profile of each novel transcript, RT-PCRexperiments were carried out with the use of variant-specific primers. SinceSCAF1 is implicated in many human malignancies, qualifying as a potentialbiomarker, the quantification of the presented novel transcripts in human samplesmay have clinical applications in different types of cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
