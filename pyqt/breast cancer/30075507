They are classified asbenign, borderline, and malignant based on the histologic features. However, all phyllodes tumor (PT) subtypes are regarded as having malignant potential andcorrect diagnosis is important for surgical management and optimal care. Thisstudy is a retrospective review of 76 women diagnosed as PT with highlights onthe imaging characteristics, pathology, and surgical treatment over a 7-yearperiod in a tertiary medical center of urban population in Malaysia. There were45 benign, 16 borderline, and 15 malignant PT. The median age for benign PT was43, borderline 48.5, and malignant 42 years. The Malay ethnic group constitute52.6% of cases, with 27.6% and 18.4% in Chinese and Indian ethnic groups,respectively. On mammograms, most benign (64.3%) and 33.3% of malignant PT showedhigh-density lesions. Calcifications were only seen in 2 benign PT. Onultrasound, 86% of benign PT was well-circumscribed whilst 50.0% of malignant PT had irregular outline. Cystic spaces were seen in 40.0% of malignant and 9.5% of benign PT. 80% of malignant PT lesions were heterogenous. Malignant PTdemonstrates tumor heterogeneity, cystic spaces, and posterior acousticenhancement on ultrasound. Half of malignant PT showed regular borders onultrasound and appear well circumscribed on mammogram. A total of 46 patients hadwide local excision or excision biopsy whilst 30 underwent mastectomy as primary treatment. The majority of the borderline and malignant PTs in our study (75.0%and 85.7% respectively) and only 5 out of the 43 (11.6%) benign PT underwentmastectomy. There were 2 tumor recurrence in the benign PT group and 1 case inthe borderline and malignant group respectively.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011412 PMID: 30075507  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
