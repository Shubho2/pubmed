Electronic address: jkotoky@gmail.com.A rapid rise in cancer cases worldwide, especially breast cancer in females,instigates the need for more effective and less side effect causing drugs fromnatural origin. Thereby, in the present study, Garcinia morella fruit wasinvestigated for antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-breast cancer activity. Preliminary antioxidant and anticancer evaluation of different fractions andcrude methanol extract of G. morella fruit suggested chloroform fraction as thebioactive fraction. Time course analysis (by 24 h, 48 h and 72 h) of thebioactive fraction (1.56-25) μg/ml treatment on breast cancer cell lines (MCF7,MDAMB231 and SKBR3) showed dose and time dependent antiproliferative responses.Further, mechanistic studies involving morphological observation and westernblotting analysis, revealed its apoptosis inducing effect on breast cancer. P53dependent up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl XL is suggested as the possible pathway of apoptosis followed by MCF7 cells on exposure to the bioactivefraction. The anti-inflammatory assays revealed that it significantly lowered therelease of nitrite and TNF-α level of LPS induced RAW 264.7 cells (p < 0.05).Moreover, pre treatment of Carrageenan induced paw edema animals with 20 mg/kg ofthe bioactive fraction significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited paw inflammation andcontrolled the cytokine and nitrite levels of the edema induced rat. Its mainbioactive component was identified to be Garcinol by UHPLC and ESI-MS/MS.Thereby, this study clearly reflects that G. morella fruit is a valuableantioxidant and anti-inflammatory gift of nature with the potential to be usedagainst breast cancer. This is also the first report of isolation of bioactivecompound Garcinol from G. morella fruit.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
