Breast cancer exhibits a distinct metastatic pattern commonly involvingbone, liver, lung, and brain. Breast cancer can be divided into differentsubtypes based on gene expression profiles, and different breast cancer subtypes show preference to distinct organ sites of metastasis. Luminal breast tumors tendto metastasize to bone while basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) displays a lungtropism of metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying this organ-specificpattern of metastasis still remain to be elucidated. In this review, we willsummarize the recent advances regarding the molecular signaling pathways as well as the therapeutic strategies for treating breast cancer lung metastasis.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2018.1456599 PMID: 29580128
