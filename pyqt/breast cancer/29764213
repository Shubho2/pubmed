Here, fruitextract of Rosa canina was used for the first time to obtain the rGO/ZnO,Ag-ZnO/rGO and Nd-ZnO/rGO NCs by green synthesis. Physico/photochemicalproperties of these NCs were evaluated using FTIR, XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM/EDX,UV-Vis, DLS and AFM. The potential of the as-synthesized NCs on ROS generatingand antioxidant activity were assessed by DPPH. After optimizing the properconcentration of the NCs their anti-tumoral efficacy were evaluated by DAPIstaining and MTT assay tests for laser therapy on MCF7 breast cancer cells.Interestingly, cell death was increased dramatically by increasing irradiationdose from 8-32 J/cm2 and then decreased by enhancing laser dose. The maximumamount of cell death is 50% which was observed in the presence of ZnO/rGO 20% by irradiation dose of 32 J/cm2. Furthermore, in comparison with 810 nm, 630 nmlasers were more effective in LLLT of MCF7 cells. The results show the potential of using rGO-based NCs in LLLT, which may be combined with other therapeuticapproaches to assist our fight against cancer.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1470523 PMID: 29764213
