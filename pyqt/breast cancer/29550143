Paclitaxel is an efficientanticancer drug for the treatment of various cancers. However, paclitaxel has asolubility of 0.5 mg/L in water and a low bioavailability of 6.5%. Moreover,paclitaxel is a substrate for p-glycoprotein, which shows a decreasedaccumulation of drug within the cancer cell expressed by a p-glycoprotein.Therefore, the purpose of this study is to prepare a paclitaxel-loaded liposomeand evaluate the effect of d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate(TPGS) as an inhibitor of p-glycoprotein on the paclitaxel-loaded liposome. Thepaclitaxel-loaded liposome and TPGS coated paclitaxel-loaded liposome hadspherical vesicles, with mean particle size 184.9 ± 18.45 nm with PDI0.324 ± 0.018 and 282.6 ± 20.41 nm with PDI 0.269 ± 0.013, respectively.Paclitaxel-loaded liposome and TPGS coated paclitaxel-loaded liposome showed acontrolled and sustained release of PTX over 72 h. The cellular uptake ofpaclitaxel from TPGS coated paclitaxel-loaded liposome was a 3.56-fold increasefor 2 h and 5.75-fold increase for 4 h compared to that from paclitaxel-loadedliposome in MCF-7/ADR cells, resulting in improved cytotoxicity against MCF-7/ADRcells. Western blot assay revealed the P-gp inhibitory effect of TPGS-coatedPTX-liposome. In conclusion, TPGS coated liposome with a sustained releasingcapability and the inhibitory effect of p-glycoprotein may be a promising carrierfor future applications in cancer therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
