For the first time, early estimateswere produced for race (whites and blacks) along with estimates for new sites:the oral cavity and pharynx, leukemia, and myeloma.RESULTS: Model validation comparing delay-adjusted rates and trends through 2014 and using 2016 submissions showed good agreement. Differences in trends through2015 in comparison with those through 2014 were evident. The rate of femalebreast cancer rose significantly from 2004 to 2015 by 0.3% per year (annualpercent change [APC] = 0.3%); the prior trend through 2014 (the same magnitude)was not yet significant. The female colon and rectum cancer trend for whitesbecame flat after previously declining. Lung and bronchus cancer for whitesshowed a significant decline (APC for males = -2.3%, 2012-2015; APC for females =-0.7%, 2011-2015). Thyroid cancer for black females changed from a continuousrise to a flat final segment (APC = 1.6%, not significant, 2011-2015). Bothkidney and renal pelvis cancer (APC = 1.5%, 2011-2015) and childhood cancers (APC= 0.5%, 2000-2015) for white males showed a significant rise in the finalsegments from previously flat trends. Kidney and renal pelvis cancer for blackmales showed a change from a significant rise to a flat trend.CONCLUSIONS: The early release of SEER data continues to be useful as apreliminary estimate of the most current cancer incidence trends.
