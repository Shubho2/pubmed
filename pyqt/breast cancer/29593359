It induces apoptosis when interacted with its ligand CD95L (FasL). However, cancercells are resistant to CD95-induced apoptosis because of the changes in deathdomain (DD) of CD95 (procaspase-8 and c-Flip). In this study, magneticnanoparticles and lipid-based gene transfection methods were performed to provideactive Fas expression in breast cancer cells. Plasmid DNA (pDNA), which canexpress both human Fas and GFP, was transfected to MCF-7 breast cancer cells.Expression of c-FLIP and caspase-8 and effect of monoclonal antibody FasL forapoptosis stimulation were investigated. Also transfection success of methods andeffects on surface protein were compared. Western blot results indicated thatMCF-7 cells do not express caspase-8 but express large amount of c-FLIPL. Bothlipid-based and magnetic nanoparticle-mediated gene transfection methodssuccessfully applied. Caspase-8 apoptosis pathway was activated on transfectedcells. Magnetic nanoparticle-mediated gene transfer is a successful non-viralmethod for transfection, and it does not affect the expression of other cellproteins, such as beta actin and lamin-B1. The raised c-FLIPL concentration incytosol inhibits apoptosis. However, transfection of CD95-GFP-tagged pDNAsignificantly increases apoptosis by activating caspase-8 pathway. FasLinteraction indicated a slight increase of apoptosis in the transfected cells.The method and pDNA applied in this study have potentials to be used in genetherapy for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41417-018-0017-2 PMID: 29593359
