In this study we investigated thecorrelation between patient-reported outcome assessments and quantitativemeasurement with the hair check to assess CIA in clinical practice.METHOD: Scalp cooling efficacy was evaluated by patients by World HealthOrganisation (WHO) of CIA, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and wig use. The HairCheck was used to determine the amount of hair (in mm2) per unit of scalp skinarea (in cm2) (Hair Mass Index, HMI). CIA was also evaluated by doctors, nursesand hairdressers.RESULTS: Baseline HMI was not predictive for hair loss. HMI declined throughoutall chemotherapy cycles, which was not reflected by patient-reported measures.HMI correlated with patient-reported hair quantity before the start of thetherapy, but not with WHO and/or VAS during therapy. Patient's opinion correlatedmoderately with the opinion of doctors and nurses (ρ = 0.50-0.56 respectively),but strongly with hair dressers (ρ = 0.70).CONCLUSIONS: The Hair check is suitable to quantify the amount of hair loss andcould complement research on refining outcome of scalp cooling, but the patient'sopinion should be considered as the best method to assess hair loss in clinicalpractice.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trialregister.nl NTR number 3082.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
