The impact of clinicopathological factors on the occurrence of IMLN metastasis was assessed in univariate and multivariatelogistic regression analyses, and a nomogram (model) was constructed to predictthe IMLN status. DFS difference was evaluated in univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses between IMLN-negative and IMLN-positive patients, andunivariate analysis was performed to compare DFS between individuals with highand low IMLN metastasis risk defined by proposed nomogram.Of 1977 enrolledpatients, 514 cases underwent IMLN dissection and 1463 cases did not undergo IMLNirradiation or dissection. We found that initial disease symptoms and signs,mammographic calcification, tumor site, number of positive axillary lymph nodes(ALNs), American Joint Committee on Cancer pT stage, and human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 status were associated with IMLN metastasis (all P < .05).Those variables were included in nomogram, whose predictive ability was betterthan that of ALN classification (area under the curve: 0.82 vs 0.76, P < .001).Univariate cox proportional hazards model indicated that better DFS was observed in IMLN-negative patients than IMLN-positive group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.87, 95%confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-3.34; P = .04), whereas no significantdifferences in DFS (HR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.49-2.00; P = .97) were found afteradjusting patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors.Nipple inversion,mammographic calcification, larger tumor size, medial tumor site, negative HER-2 status, and more positive ALNs are independent risk factors for IMLN metastasis, and the individualized nomogram is a feasible tool to predict the status of IMLN.Equivalent DFS was found between positive and negative IMLN patients who allaccepted IMLN dissection and systemic therapies.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011296 PMID: 29995764  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
