CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a) has beenreported to play a critical role in breast cancer progress. However, themolecular mechanism remains elusive.METHODS: In order to investigate the role of CPT1A in HDLEC cells, short hairpin RNA approach was utilized to knock down the CPT1A gene expression. We employedtranswell and lymphatic vessel formation assay to examine invasion andlymphangiogenesis of HDLEC (Human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells). RT-qPCRand westernblot analyses were used to determine genes expression in HDLEC andbreast cancer cells. Finally, we determined the relative rate of acetyl-CoA/CoAin shNC and shCPT1A HDLEC cells by LC-MS approach.RESULTS: Knockdown of CPT1A in breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231)abolished invasion and lymphangiogenesis of HDLEC cells. Mechanistically, CPT1Adepletion suppressed the expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, CPT1A knockdown in HDLEC cells exhibited attenuatedexpression of lymphangiogenic markers (podoplanin, VEGFR-3, VEGF-C, VEGF-D andPROX-1). Consistently, CPT1A -null HDLEC cells displayed compromised invasion andlymphangiogenesis compared with negative control. Further investigation revealed that CPT1A regulated VEGFR3 via acetyl-CoA mediated H3K9ac, which could beabrogated by supplement of acetate.CONCLUSIONS: In present study, we revealed the mechanism by which CPT1A regulatesbreast cancer-associated invasion and lymphangiogenesis. Our findings provideinsights into CPT1A -promoted breast tumor metastasis and provide rationale forunderstanding breast cancer metastasis.Copyright Â© 2018.
