This paper reviews existing research on theprocesses underlying distress experienced by cancer caregivers, with a specificfocus on the role of coping strategies on psychophysiological correlates ofburden.Methods: A broad literature search was conducted in health-related databasesnamely MEDLINE, Science Citations Index Expanded, Scopus, and PsycINFO, usingrelevant search terms. All types of studies published in English were considered for inclusion.Results: We found that cancer caregiving was related to increased blood pressure,dysregulation of autonomic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary-axisdysregulation, immune changes, and poor health-related behaviors. We also foundthat problem-focused coping was associated with decreased caregiver burden,decreased depression, and better adjustment, while emotion-focused coping wasrelated to higher levels of posttraumatic growth and psychological distress. The way coping impacts psychophysiological correlates of burden, however, remainsunexplored.Conclusion: A better understanding of the psychophysiological elements ofcaregiver burden is needed. We propose a model that attends specifically tofactors that may impact psychophysiological correlates of burden among cancercaregivers. Based on the proposed model, psychosocial interventions thatspecifically target caregivers' coping and emotion regulation skills, familyfunctioning, and self-care are endemic to the preservation of the health andwell-being of this vulnerable population.DOI: 10.2147/PRBM.S164946 PMCID: PMC5973462PMID: 29872357
