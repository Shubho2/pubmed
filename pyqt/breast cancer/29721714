Patients were randomly assigned to the early oral feedinggroup (intervention group) or the conventional postoperative management group(control group) for each procedure. We evaluated the length of postoperativehospital stay and the incidence of postoperative complications in each group.RESULTS: No significant differences in length of postoperative stay were foundbetween the intervention and control groups of the patients who underwent DG. Theincidence of postoperative complications was significantly greater in the DGintervention group. In contrast, the length of postoperative stay wassignificantly shorter in the TG intervention group, although the TG group did notattain the established target sample size.CONCLUSION: Early oral feeding did not shorten the postoperative hospital stayafter DG. The higher incidence of postoperative complications precluded theunselected adoption of early oral feeding for DG patients. Further confirmativestudies are required to definitively establish the potential benefits of earlyoral feeding for TG patients.DOI: 10.1007/s00595-018-1665-4 PMID: 29721714
