To obtainfurther insights into this "orphan disease," we have established the ATC ResearchConsortium of Japan (ATCCJ) in 2009. It represents a multicenter registry for ATCthat have been treated in Japan. To date, 67 institutions have taken part in the collaborative research system and over 1,200 cases have been accumulated in itsdatabase. Using this big data, several retrospective studies were carried out to evaluate 1) prognostic factors to determine initial treatment policy, 2)significance of extended radical surgery for Stage IVB cases, 3) characteristics of ATC incidentally found on pathological examination and 4) pathologicalfeatures of ATC with long-term survival. Moreover, the ATCCJ has conducted aninvestigator-initiated, nationwide, prospective clinical trial since 2012;namely, the feasibility, safety and efficacy study of weekly paclitaxeladministration for patients with ATC (UMIN: 000008574). Revised Japaneseguidelines for treatment of thyroid tumors are going to adopt the recommendationsfrom the results of this research. Since 2016, the ATCCJ has started the phase IIstudy assessing the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib, a newly developed tyrosinekinase inhibitor for ATC (UMIN: 000020773). Our nationwide clinical trial networkwill strengthen the activity to recruit orphan disease patients and may discover new strategies to conquer this dismal malignancy in the near future.DOI: 10.1272/jnms.2018_85-3 PMID: 29540641  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
