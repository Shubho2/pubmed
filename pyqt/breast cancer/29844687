In the past years, a growingbody of evidence demonstrated that immune response plays a significant role incancer outcome. However, immune prognostic markers are not completely validatedin clinical practice in BC patients.Materials and methods: With the aim to characterize immune features, severalparameters were analyzed in peripheral blood at diagnosis of 85 nonmetastatic BC patients between April 2011 and July 2014.Results: With a median follow-up of 38.6 months, peripheral blood analysis of BC patients (stages I, II, and III) showed that total lymphocyte and T lymphocytecounts were augmented in nonrelapsed patients. Also, a higherneutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio was associated with prolonged disease-freesurvival. Natural killer cell receptor analysis revealed that early activationreceptor CD69 was associated with a better outcome.Conclusion: This preliminary evidence is in accordance with the concept of immunesurveillance. We suggest an "immune phenotype" that provides relevant prognostic information in early-stage BC patients and which could be useful in thedecision-making process.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S160911 PMCID: PMC5961634PMID: 29844687
