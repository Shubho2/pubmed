In vivo, cancer cells are exposed to contact guidance and chemotactic cues. Depending on the strength of such cues,cells will migrate in a random or directed manner. While similar cues may alsostimulate cell proliferation, it is not clear whether cell cycle progressionaffects migration of cancer cells and whether this effect is different in random versus directed migration. In this study, we tested the effect of cell cycleprogression on contact guided migration in 2D and 3D environments, in the breast carcinoma cell line, FUCCI-MDA-MB-231. The results were quantified from live cellmicroscopy images using the open source lineage editing and validation imageanalysis tools (LEVER). In 2D, cells were placed inside 10 Î¼m-wide microchannels to stimulate contact guidance, with or without an additional chemotactic gradientof the soluble epidermal growth factor. In 3D, contact guidance was modeled byaligned collagen fibers. In both 2D and 3D, contact guidance was cellcycle-dependent, while the addition of the chemo-attractant gradient in 2Dincreased cell velocity and persistence in directionally migrating cells,regardless of their cell cycle phases. In both 2D and 3D contact guidance, cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle outperformed cells in the S/G2 phase in termsof migration persistence and instantaneous velocity. These data suggest that inthe presence of contact guidance cues in vivo, breast carcinoma cells in the G1phase of the cell cycle may be more efficient in reaching the neighboringvasculature.DOI: 10.1063/1.5026419 PMCID: PMC5997297 [Available on 2019-09-01]PMID: 29911682
