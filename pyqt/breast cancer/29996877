However, to the best of our knowledge, few examples have been reported to selectively control autophagy process and ultimately achieve efficienttherapeutic potential.RESULTS: In this study, monolayers of poly (acryloyl-L, D and racemic valine)(L-PAV-AuNPs, D-PAV-AuNPs and L/D-PAV-AuNPs) chiral molecules were anchored onthe surfaces of gold nanoparticles (PAV-AuNPs), and the subsequentchirality-selective effects on autophagy activation were thoroughly studied. The cytotoxicity induced by PAV-AuNPs towards MDA-MB-231 cells (Breast cancer cells) was achieved mainly through autophagy and showed chirality-dependent, withD-PAV-AuNPs exhibiting high autophagy-inducing activity in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, the PAV-AuNPs exhibited autophagy inactivation for normal cells, e.g., 3T3 fibroblasts and HBL-100 cells. The chirality-selective autophagy activationeffect in MDA-MB-231 cells was likely attributed to the chirality-variant ROSgeneration, cellular uptake and their continuous autophagy stimulus. Furthermore,the intratumoral injection of D-PAV-AuNPs could largely suppress the tumor growthbut exhibit negligible toxicity in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: As the first exploration on stereospecific NPs for autophagyinduction, this work not only substantiates that chiral polymer coated NPs canselective induce autophagy-specific in cancer cells and achieve a high tumoreradication efficiency in vivo, but also opens up a new direction in discovering unprecedented stereospecific nanoagents for autophagy-associated tumor treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s12951-018-0383-9 PMCID: PMC6040058PMID: 29996877
