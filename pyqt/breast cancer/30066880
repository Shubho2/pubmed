China.PSMB4, proteasome subunit β4, is a member of the ubiquitin-proteasome family, andis elevated in a variety of malignancies. However, the expression level andrelated mechanism of PSMB4 in breast cancer remains unclear. Therefore, thepresent study investigated the expression level of PSMB4 in eight pairs of breastcancer and adjacent normal tissues. In addition, the relationship between theexpression of PSMB4 and the clinical data of 92 breast cancer patients wasdiscussed. First, it was found that PSMB4 expression was obviously upregulated inbreast cancer tumor tissues and cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), and its level was significantly associated with tumor grade (P=0.005), tumor size (P=0.047),Ki-67 expression (P=0.040) and the poor prognosis of breast cancer. The presentresults demonstrated that PSMB4 could promote the proliferation of breast cancer cells, and was positively correlated with the expression of PCNA using anin vitro starvation-refeeding experiment. In addition, PSMB4‑siRNA transfectionassay suggested that PSMB4 knockdown can decrease NF-κB activity and cellviability, and result in cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase. These findingsrevealed that PSMB4 might facilitate breast cancer progression by promoting cell proliferation and viability. In summary, PSMB4 may be recognized as anefficacious prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6588 PMID: 30066880
