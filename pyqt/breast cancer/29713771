Between 2016 and 2017, 251 consecutive women(mean age, 53.8 years) with breast cancer (230 invasive, 21 in situ) whounderwent preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with DTI were identified. Diffusion gradients were applied in 20 directions (b values, 0 and 1,000 s/mm2). DTI metrics - mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) - weremeasured for breast lesions and contralateral normal breast by two radiologistsand were correlated with histological findings using the Mann-Whitney U-test and linear regression analysis.RESULTS: MD and FA were significantly lower for breast cancers than for normalfibroglandular tissues (1.03 ± 0.25×10-3 mm2/s vs. 1.60 ± 0.19×10-3 mm2/s, p <0.001 and 0.29 ± 0.09 vs. 0.33 ± 0.06, p < 0.001, respectively). Significantdifferences were observed in MD between invasive cancer and ductal carcinoma insitu lesions (p < 0.001). Multivariate linear analysis showed that larger size(>2 cm) (p = 0.007), high histological grade (grade 3) (p = 0.045) and axillarynode metastasis (p = 0.009) were significantly associated with lower MD ininvasive breast cancer patients. Larger size (p < 0.001) and high histologicalgrade (p = 0.025) were significantly associated with lower FA.CONCLUSIONS: DTI-derived diffusion metrics, such as MD and FA, are associatedwith histological prognostic factors in breast cancer patients.KEY POINTS: • MD was significantly lower for breast cancers than for normalbreast tissues. • FA was significantly lower for breast cancers than for normalbreast tissues. • Reduced DTI metrics were associated with poor prognosticfactors of breast cancer. • DTI may provide valuable information concerningbiological aggressiveness in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5429-8 PMID: 29713771
