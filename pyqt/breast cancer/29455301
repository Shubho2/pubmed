Box 7347,Winston-Salem, NC, 27109, USA.PURPOSE: This study aims (1) to estimate percentages of partnered women who aresexually active over the first 2 years post-breast cancer diagnosis; (2) toidentify factors related to sexual inactivity; and (3) to evaluate separately,among both sexually active and inactive survivors, the relation between sexualproblems and treatment-related variables, symptoms, and psychosocial factors.METHODS: Longitudinal observational study of breast cancer survivors recruitedwithin 8 months of cancer diagnosis and followed for 18 months. The main outcome measures were (1) being sexually active/inactive in the past month and (2) sexualproblems assessed with the four-item sexual problem domain of the Quality of Lifein Adult Cancer Survivors (QLACS) scale.RESULTS: At baseline, 52.4% of women reported being sexually active in the pastmonth. This percentage increased to 60.7% 18 months later. In multivariablerepeated-measures analyses, age, past chemotherapy, depressive symptoms, andlower perceived attractiveness were related to inactivity. Sexually inactivewomen reported more problems on the QLACS than sexually active women. Instratified multivariable analyses, depressive symptoms were related to greatersexual problems for both sexually active and inactive women, as was vaginaldryness. Among the sexually active women, younger age at diagnosis, less illness intrusiveness, and lower perceived attractiveness were related to more problems.CONCLUSIONS: Research has shown that sexual functioning/sexual health are keyaspects of quality of life for many cancer survivors, and are often not addressedby health care providers. Future studies should examine how such topics arehandled by clinicians in their interactions with survivors.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4098-0 PMCID: PMC6019113 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29455301
