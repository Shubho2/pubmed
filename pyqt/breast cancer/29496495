Electronic address: gregm@uq.edu.au.AIMS: To assess levels of the calcium permeable transient receptor potentialcation channel, subfamily melastatin, member 8 (TRPM8) in breast cancer molecularsubtypes and to assess the consequences of TRPM8 pharmacological inhibition with AMTB (an inhibitor of TRPM8) on breast cancer cell lines.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability and migration of breast cancer cells wasdetermined using MTS assays and wound healing assays, respectively. RNA-Seqanalysis of breast tumours and qPCR in breast cancer cell lines were used toassess mRNA levels of ion channels. Membrane potential assays were employed toassess the effects of AMTB against specific voltage gated sodium channels (NaV).KEY FINDINGS: TRPM8 levels were significantly higher in breast cancers of thebasal molecular subtype. AMTB decreased viable cell number in MDA-MB-231 andSK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines (30 and 100 μM), and also reduced the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells (30 μM). However, these effects were independent of TRPM8, asno TRPM8 mRNA was detected in MDA-MB-231 cells. AMTB was identified as aninhibitor of NaV isoforms. NaV1.1-1.9 were expressed in a number of breast cancercell lines, with NaV1.5 mRNA highest in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to the otherbreast cancer cell lines assessed.SIGNIFICANCE: TRPM8 levels may be elevated in basal breast cancers, however,TRPM8 expression appears to be lost in many breast cancer cell lines. Some of theeffects of AMTB attributed to TRPM8 may be due to effects on NaV channels.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
