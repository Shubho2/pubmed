Autophagy has been implicated in pathogenesis of diversediseases such as neurodegeneration and cancer. Due to the therapeutic potential, the autophagy-modulating agents have profoundly enriched the spectrum of toolsused to investigate autophagy. However, many of these compounds have additionaloff-target effects that may confound elucidation of autophagy in certaincontexts. There remains high demand for highly specific and novel chemotypes thatcan be used to study the regulation mechanism of autophagy and contribute novelpharmacophores for therapeutic purposes. Here, we describe a cell-basedquantitative high-content screening (HCS) for autophagy inhibitors using a human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cell line stably expressing EGFP-LC3, a bona fidemarker of autophagy.DOI: 10.1007/7651_2018_125 PMID: 29470784
