Percent breast density (PD), absolute dense (DA), and non-dense areas (NDA) were measured from digitizedfilm mammograms using a computer-assisted thresholding technique; all measureswere square root transformed. Alcohol consumption was assessed with a foodfrequency questionnaire (0, < 5, and ≥ 5 g/day). Information regarding breastcancer risk factors was obtained from baseline or biennial questionnaires closestto the mammogram date. We used generalized linear regression to examineassociations between alcohol and breast density measures in women with no HThistory, current, and past HT users.RESULTS: In multivariable analyses, we found no associations of alcoholconsumption with PD (p trend = 0.32) and DA (p trend = 0.53) and an inverseassociation with NDA (β = - 0.41, 95% CI - 0.73, - 0.09 for ≥ 5 g/day, ptrend < 0.01). In the stratified analysis by HT status, alcohol was notassociated with PD in any of the strata. We found a significant inverseassociation of alcohol with NDA among past HT users (β = - 0.79, 95% CI - 1.51,- 0.07 for ≥ 5 g/day, p trend = 0.02). There were no significant interactionsbetween alcohol and HT in relation to PD, DA, and NDA (p interaction = 0.19,0.42, and 0.43, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that associations of alcohol with breastdensity do not vary by HT status.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1053-9 PMID: 29938357
