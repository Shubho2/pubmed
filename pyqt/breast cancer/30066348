[Epub ahead of print]BRCA mutation in breast cancer patients: Prognostic impact and implications onclinical management.Loi M(1), Desideri I(1), Olmetto E(1), Francolini G(1), Greto D(1), Bonomo P(1), Simontacchi G(1), Di Brina L(1), Meattini I(1), Livi L(1).Author information: (1)Radiotherapy Department, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.BRCA1/2 mutations are involved in breast cancer (BC) susceptibility but theirinfluence on outcome is unclear. We reviewed BC patients tested for BRCA todetermine biological features and influence on outcome. BRCA-1 was correlated to younger age (P = 0.035), nodal involvement (P = 0.030), higher tumor grade(P = 0.0022) and Ki-67 (P = 0.014), ER/PgR negative status (P = 0.00042 and0.0091, respectively), and use of adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.000038); BRCA was neither predictive for chemotherapy administration nor resulted in impairedoutcome or occurrence of secondary BC. BRCA status did not influence outcomedespite higher biological aggressiveness and younger age at presentation.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13100 PMID: 30066348
