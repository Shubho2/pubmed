Electronic address: tpsingh.aiims@gmail.com.Secretory signalling glycoprotein (SPX-40) from mammary gland is highly expressedduring involution. This protein is involved in a programmed cell death duringtissue remodelling which occurs at the end of lactation. SPX-40 was isolated and purified from buffalo (SPB-40) from the samples obtained during involution. Onesolution of SPB-40 was made by dissolving it in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl and 50 mM NaCl at pH 8.0. Another solution was made by adding 25% ethanol to the above solution. The biological effects of SPB-40 dissolved in above two solutionswere evaluated on MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Free SPB-40 indicatedsignificant pro-apoptotic effects while ethanol exposed SPB-40 showedconsiderably reduced effects on the apoptosis. SPB-40 was crystallized in thenative state. The crystals of SPB-40 were soaked in four separate solutionscontaining 25% acetone, 25% ethanol, 25% butanol and 25% MPD. Four separate data sets were collected and their structures were determined at high resolutions. In all the four structures, the molecules of acetone, ethanol, butanol and MPDrespectively were observed in the hydrophobic binding pocket of SPB-40. As aresult of which, the conformation of Trp78 was altered thus blocking the binding site in SPB-40 leading to the loss of activity.Copyright © 2018.
