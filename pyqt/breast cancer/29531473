Among them, there were195 patients with multiple primary malignant neoplasms: 54.9% patients withsynchronous cancer and 45.1% patients with metachronous cancer. The average ageof patients was 46.6 years, and the percentage of postmenopausal women was 63.1%.Among patients with synchronous cancer, there were 56.1% patients with onlybreast localizations and 43.9% with combination of breast and otherlocalizations, and among patients with metachronous cancer, there were 46.6%patients with only breast localizations and 53.4% with combination of breast and other localizations. All the patients were evaluated in terms of aggressivenessof the disease, survival rates, as well as risk factors and treatment options.Results: A more aggressive course of breast cancer is observed in patientsexposed to radiation from the Chernobyl accident under the age of 30 years(P < .01). The clinical course of disease in patients with synchronous cancer is worse and prognostically unfavorable compared with metachronous cancer (P < .01).The course of the disease in patients who underwent mastectomy is worse compared with patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery (P < .01). Plastic andreconstructive surgery in patients with synchronous cancer was proven to bereasonable in terms of increase in survival (P < .01).Conclusions: The patients with multiple primary breast cancer should haveattentive management and treatment. Multidisciplinary team should concern all therisk factors and provide the most sufficient option of management. This iscrucial to continue research in this oncological area.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418759959 PMCID: PMC5843092PMID: 29531473
