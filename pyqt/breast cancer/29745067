Triple negativebreast cancer (TNBC) is a molecular subtype of breast cancer which has a highmortality rate because of aggressive proliferation, quick occurrence ofmetastasis, and lack of effective treatment. New data show evidence that the typeof anaesthesia can affect breast cancer recurrence and long-term outcome. BecauseTNBC lacks targets for modern specific therapy, a perioperative period could bethe field of investigations for the long-term outcomes in TNBC influence. Wereviewed the literature on research focusing on the influence of anaesthetics to oxidative stress, inflammation, molecular regulators, and TNBC oncologicaloutcomes.PMID: 29745067
