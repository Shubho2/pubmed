[Epub ahead of print]Comparison of the incidence of febrile neutropenia in obese and normal weightbreast cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy and prophylacticpegfilgrastim.Collins JM(1), Fleming GF(1), Christ TN(2).Author information: (1)1 University of Chicago Medicine, Section of Breast Cancer, Chicago, IL, USA.(2)2 Department of Pharmacy, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.Purpose Common breast cancer chemotherapy regimens are associated with a risk of febrile neutropenia, so prophylactic colony-stimulating factors are incorporated for high-risk patients. Filgrastim utilizes weight-based dosing; however, itssustained-release formulation utilizes fixed dosing. The purpose of this study isto determine whether obese breast cancer patients who receive pegfilgrastim areat increased risk of developing febrile neutropenia. Methods This study is asingle-center, retrospective chart review. Breast cancer patients werecategorized as normal weight (body mass index < 30), overweight (body mass index 30-39), or obese (body mass index ≥ 40). Results A total of 442 eligible patientswere identified between 1 July 2012 and 19 May 2016. Twenty-eight were includedin the obese group. Twenty-eight patients from each non-obese group were randomlyselected to make up the overweight and normal weight groups. Incidence of febrileneutropenia was 1, 2, and 2 of 28 in the normal weight, overweight, and obeseresearch groups, respectively. Increased use of antibiotics was observed in theobese group as compared to the normal and overweight groups (2, 1, 1,respectively; p = 0.0005). Median number of days on antibiotics was statisticallysignificantly higher in the obese group at 10 days compared to the normal andoverweight groups at seven days ( p = 0.03). Conclusion Obese patients are not atincreased risk of febrile neutropenia. However, they may have a lower thresholdfor febrile neutropenia and require more antibiotics after chemotherapy. Clinicalsignificance of these results cannot be determined given the small sample size,so further multicenter studies are required.DOI: 10.1177/1078155218776471 PMID: 29768957
