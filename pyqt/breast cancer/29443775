Surgical exploration was performed subsequently and frozen section showed malignant tumor. Therefore, a total thyroidectomy, central, and bilateral lateral neck dissection wereperformed and adjuvant radiotherapy of 60 Gy was administered. The patient wasalive and had no recurrence at 6-month follow-up.LESSONS: Although primary undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in the thyroid is extremely rare, patients who presented with a rapidly growing painless mass inthe neck should be considered and it is essential to excise the tumor completely as soon as possible.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000009927 PMCID: PMC5839869PMID: 29443775  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
