EBV is responsible for infectious mononucleosisand multiple lymphoid and epithelial malignancies including B-cell lymphomas(Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and post-transplant lymphoproliferativedisorder), various T-cell/NK lymphoproliferative disorders, nasopharyngealcarcinoma, and gastric carcinoma, respectively. In addition, the presence of EBV has been documented in other cancers including breast, prostate, oral, andsalivary gland carcinomas. The presence and role of EBV in cervical cancer andits precursor lesions (CIN) have also been described, but the results from theliterature are inconsistent, and the causal role of EBV in cervical cancerpathogenesis has not been established yet. In the present review, we brieflysurveyed and critically appraised the current literature on EBV in cervicalcancer and its variants (lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma) as well as itsprecursor lesions (CIN). In addition, we discussed the possible interactionsbetween EBV and human papilloma virus as well as between EBV and immunecheckpoint regulators (PD-L1). Though further studies are needed, the availabledata suggest a possible causal relationship between EBV and cervical cancerpathogenesis.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00113 PMCID: PMC5913353PMID: 29719817
