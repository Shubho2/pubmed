We performed amatched-pair analysis of breast cancer patients with and without BRCA mutationsand compared the frequency of BM in both groups.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a database of 1935 patients treated for localizedbreast cancer at our institution from 2009 to 2014 we identified 20 patients withBRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and manually matched 40 patients without BRCA mutations accounting for age, stage, estrogen receptor expression, and human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. Comparisons of freedom from brainmetastasis, brain metastasis-free survival, and overall survival were made using the log rank test. Testing for a basal-type phenotype using theimmunohistochemistry definition (ER/PR/HER2 and either CK 5/6 or EGFR) wasperformed for BRCA patients who developed BM and their matched controls.RESULTS: We analyzed 60 patients: 20 BRCA and 40 were matched controls. Medianfollow-up was 37 and 49 months, respectively. Three years freedom from brainmetastasis was 84% for BRCA patients and 97% for BRCA controls (P=0.049). Threeyears brain metastasis-free survival was 84% and 97% for the BRCA+ and controls, respectively (P=0.176). Mean time to brain failure was 11 months from diagnosisfor the BRCA patients. All 3 BRCA1 patients who developed BM were of a basal-typetriple negative phenotype.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients with germline BRCA1 mutations appear to have a shorter interval to brain progression while accounting for confounding factors.DOI: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000466 PMID: 29782359
