We comprehensivelyreviewed and analyzed the effect of DROSHA and DGCR8 polymorphisms on cancerrisk. Eligible articles were selected according to a series of inclusion andexclusion criteria. Consequently, ten case-control studies (from nine citations) with 4265 cancer cases and 4349 controls were involved in a meta-analysis ofseven most prevalent SNPs (rs10719 T/C, rs6877842 G/C, rs2291109 A/T, rs642321C/T, rs3757 G/A, rs417309 G/A, rs1640299 T/G). Our findings demonstrated that thers417309 SNP in DGCR8 was significantly associated with an elevated risk ofoverall cancer in every genetic model. In stratified analysis, correlations ofDROSHA rs10719 and rs6877842 SNPs were observed in Asian and laryngeal cancersubgroups, respectively. Moreover, associations of the rs417309 SNP could also befound in numerous subgroups including: Asian and Caucasian population subgroups; laryngeal and breast cancer subgroups; population-based (PB) and hospital-based(HB) subgroups. In conclusion, the DROSHA rs10719, rs6877842 SNPs, and DGCR8rs417309 SNP play pivotal roles in cancerogenesis and may be potential biomarkersfor cancer-forewarning.Â© 2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20180072 PMCID: PMC6019356PMID: 29654164
