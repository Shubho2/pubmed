However the sensitive detection of thesevesicles remains a challenge. Here we present a label-free electrochemical sensorto measure the EVs secretion levels of hypoxic and normoxic MCF-7 cells. Thesensor design includes two consecutive steps; i) Au electrode surfacefunctionalization for anti-CD81 Antibody and ii) EVs capture. The label-freedetection of EVs was done via Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) andElectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The working linear range for thesensor was 102-109 EVs/ml with an LOD 77 EVs/mL and 379 EVs/ml for EIS and DPVbased detection. A blood-abundant protein, RhD was used for the selectivity test.In order to assess the performance of the biosensor, the level of EVs secretionby the human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line was compared with enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assays (ELISA) and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA). Designedlabel-free electrochemical sensors utilized for quantification of EVs secretionenhancement due to CoCl2-induced hypoxia and 1.23 fold increase with respect tonormoxic conditions was found.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27203-9 PMCID: PMC6010476PMID: 29925885
