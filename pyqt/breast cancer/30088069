Twenty six patients with both body CT and breast MRI available were evaluated. Two radiologists calculated TPA on1.25-mm and 5-mm body CT images. Two radiologists measured PMA on axialT1-weighted images. Statistical analysis included inter- and intra-readeragreement and correlation between TPA on CT and PMA on MRI.RESULTS: The Pearson r correlation coefficient was 0.70 (95% CI 0.41-0.81) andthe coefficient of determination was 0.49. The inter-reader agreement was k =0.85 and k = 0.79 for axial 1.25-mm and 5-mm CT images, respectively. Theintra-reader agreement of reader 1 was k = 0.98 and k = 0.94 for 1.25-mm and 5-mmCT images, respectively. The intra-reader agreement of reader 2 was k = 0.95 and k = 0.94 for 1.25-mm and 5-mm CT images, respectively. On axial T1-weightedimages, the inter-reader agreement for radiologists evaluating the PMA was k =0.61. Intra-observer agreement of reader 1 and reader 2 for PMA estimation wasgood (0.62 and 0.64), respectively.CONCLUSION: The correlation between TPA on CT images and PMA on MRI was verygood. Pectoralis muscle area on breast MRI could be useful to estimate musclemass in women with breast cancer.KEY POINTS: • Pectoralis muscle area can be estimated on breast MRI • Total psoasarea on CT and pectoralis muscle area on MRI are strongly correlated • Pectoralismuscle area on breast MRI could estimate the skeletal muscle mass.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5663-0 PMID: 30088069
