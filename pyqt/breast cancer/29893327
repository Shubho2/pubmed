Urokinaseplasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) play very important roles during tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The purpose of thisstudy was to evaluate plasma levels of uPAR and CAIX and the effect ofanthracycline-based chemotherapy on these biomarkers in patients with operablebreast cancer.Materials and Methods: Sixty-five patients and 25 age-matched healthy controlswere enrolled. Levels of uPAR and CAIX were investigated before and afteradjuvant chemotherapy. Basal (prechemotherapy) uPAR and CAIX levels in patientswere compared with those in healthy controls and in patients after 3 cycles ofchemotherapy. Levels of uPAR and CAIX were determined using the ELISA method.Results: uPAR and CAIX levels were significantly higher in patients (P: 0.02 and P: 0.03, respectively). Postchemotherapy uPAR and CAIX levels were higher thanbasal levels (P: 0.645 and P < 0.001, respectively). A cut-off value of 27.99pg/mL for uPAR was associated with 45.31% sensitivity and 84.62% specificity, andwith a positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.9% and a negative predictive value(NPV) of 38.6%. A cut-off value of 777.84 pg/mL for CAIX was associated with90.62% sensitivity and 30.77% specificity, and with a PPV of 76.3% and an NPV of 57.1%.Conclusion: We determined that uPAR and CAIX levels were higher in thefluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) chemotherapy group than inthe control group, but there was no difference between the FEC andepirubicin/adriamycin chemotherapy groups in terms of basal and postchemotherapy uPAR, CAIX levels. Furthermore, uPAR is more specific, and CAIX is more sensitivein the diagnosis of breast cancer.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.174547 PMID: 29893327
