For children, conservative nonsurgicalmanagement requiring parents' commitment is not consensual and differs according to the team; some teams developed new surgical techniques.1,4-6 Low-stretchbandages are the cornerstone of therapy to reduce lymphoedema volume in adultsbut no specific data on children are available. We retrospectively analysed alarge cohort of children with primary lower limb lymphoedema treated withlow-stretch bandages. This article is protected by copyright.
