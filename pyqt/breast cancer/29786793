Hydrogel biomaterials mimic crucialproperties of native extracellular matrices, including mechanical support, celladhesion sites and proteolytic degradability. As such, they are applied as 3Dcell culture platforms to replicate tissue-like architectures observed in vivo,allowing physiologically relevant cell behaviors. Here we review bioengineered 3Dapproaches used for prostate and breast cancer. Furthermore, we describe thesynthesis and use of gelatin methacryloyl-based hydrogels as in vitro 3D cancermodel. This platform is used to engineer the microenvironments for prostate andbreast cancer cells to study processes regulating spheroid formation, cellfunctions and responses to therapeutic compounds. Collectively, thesebioengineered 3D approaches provide cell biologists with innovative pre-clinical tools that integrate the complexity of the disease seen in patients to advanceour knowledge of cancer cell physiology and the contribution of a tumor'ssurrounding milieu.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7845-8_10 PMID: 29786793
