As a case study, this paper usesMDA-MB-231 breast cancer single-cells treated with the antidiabetic drugmetformin. We show that mixture-model-based unsupervised methods with validation from hierarchical clustering can identify single-cell subpopulations (clusters). These clusters are characterized by a small set of genes (1% of the genome) that have significant differential expression across the clusters and are also highly correlated with pathways with anticancer effects driven by metformin. Among theidentified small set of genes associated with reduced breast cancer incidence,laboratory experiments on one of the genes, CDC42, showed that its downregulationby metformin inhibited cancer cell migration and proliferation, thus validatingthe ability of machine learning approaches to identify biologically relevantcandidates for laboratory experiments. Given the large size of the human genomeand limitations in cost and skilled resources, the broader impact of this work inidentifying a small set of differentially expressed genes after drug treatmentlies in augmenting the drug-disease knowledge of pharmacogenomics experts inlaboratory investigations, which could help establish novel biological mechanismsassociated with drug response in diseases beyond breast cancer.DOI: 10.1109/TNB.2018.2851997 PMID: 29994716
