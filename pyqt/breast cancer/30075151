In this study including 19 MBC and 36 non-MBC BLC, we refined thetranscriptomic and genomic knowledge about this entity. Unsupervised andsupervised analysis of transcriptomic profiles confirmed that MBC clearly differsfrom non-MBC BLC, with 92 genes overexpressed and 154 genes underexpressed in MBCcompared to non-MBC BLC. Immunity-related pathways are the most differentiallyrepresented pathways in MBC compared to non-MBC BLC. Pro-apoptotic gene BCLG(official name BCL2L14) is by far the most intensely overexpressed gene in MBC. ART-qPCR validation study conducted in 526 breast tumors corresponding to allmolecular subtypes documented the specificity of BCLG overexpression in MBC,which was confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. We also showed that the majority of MBC belong to the immunomodulatory triple-negative breastcancer subtype. Using pan-genomic analysis, we showed that MBC harbors morelosses of heterozygosity than non-MBC BLC. Our observations corroborate thenotion that MBC remains a distinct entity that could benefit from specifictreatment strategies (like de-escalation or targeted therapy) adapted to thisrare tumor type.Copyright © 2018.
