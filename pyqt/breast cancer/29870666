Epub2018 Jun 13.Method for Dynamically Detecting Secretions from Single Cells Using a Nanopore.Kennedy E, Hokmabadi M, Dong Z, McKelvey K, Nelson EM, Timp G.Secreted proteins mediate cell-to-cell communications. Thus, eavesdropping on thesecretome could reveal the cellular phenotype, but it is challenging to detectthe proteins because they are secreted only in minute amounts and then diluted inblood plasma or contaminated by cell culture medium or the lysate. In this pilot study, it is demonstrated that secretions from single cancer cells can bedetected and dynamically analyzed through measurements of blockades in theelectrolytic current due to single molecules translocating through a nanopore in a thin inorganic membrane. It is established that the distribution of blockadescan be used to differentiate three different cancer cell lines (U937, MDA-MB-231,and MCF-7) in real time and quickly (<20 s). Importantly, the distinctiveblockades associated with the chemokine CCL5, a prognostic factor for diseaseprogression in breast cancer, along with other low-mass biomarkers of breastcancer (PI3, TIMP1, and MMP1) were identified in the context of the secretome of these three cell types, tracked with time, and used to provide information on thecellular phenotype.DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b01257 PMID: 29870666
