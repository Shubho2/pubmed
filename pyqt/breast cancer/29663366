Further, DNA copynumber alterations (CNAs), which can result from radiation-induced double-strand breaks, are frequently occurring in breast cancer cells. We set out to identify asignature of CNAs discriminating breast cancers from radiation-exposed andnon-exposed female patients. We analyzed resected breast cancer tissues from 68exposed female Chernobyl clean-up workers and evacuees and 68 matched non-exposedcontrol patients for CNAs by array comparative genomic hybridization analysis(aCGH). Using a stepwise forward-backward selection approach a non-complex CNAsignature, that is, less than ten features, was identified in the training dataset, which could be subsequently validated in the validation data set (pvalue < 0.05). The signature consisted of nine copy number regions located onchromosomal bands 7q11.22-11.23, 7q21.3, 16q24.3, 17q21.31, 20p11.23-11.21,1p21.1, 2q35, 2q35, 6p22.2. The signature was independent of any clinicalcharacteristics of the patients. In all, we identified a CNA signature that hasthe potential to allow identification of radiation-associated breast cancer atthe individual level.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31533 PMID: 29663366
