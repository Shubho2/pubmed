Flap complications, prolongedseroma, need for axillary drainage, wound infection, lymphedema, shoulderstiffness, and paresthesia are major causes for morbidity after axillarydissection. Different techniques have been implemented to tackle these problems. Few of these include reducing the axillary dead space, using various forms ofenergy devices.AIMS: We have prospectively compared two energy sources, namely, ultrasonicdissector (UD) against the electrocautery dissection in axillary dissection forbreast cancer with respect to outcomes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred female patients with breast cancer undergoing modified radical mastectomy were randomized to either of the two arms - axillary dissection using UD and axillary dissection using electrocautery. The parameters taken into consideration were operating time, operative blood loss, amount andduration of axillary drainage, flap complications, nodal yield, and postoperativepain scoring.RESULTS: There were no significant differences overall between the two groupswith respect to oncological safety and functional outcomes.DOI: 10.4103/ijc.IJC_289_17 PMID: 29798955
