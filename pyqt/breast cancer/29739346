Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR)were calculated for immigrants from each world region versus Canadian-bornresidents and stratified by neighborhood income quintile and length of stay.Binomial regression analysis was used to determine the association ofneighbourhood income, length of stay, and location of birth with colorectal andbreast cancer incidence.RESULTS: Canadian immigrants born in South Asia had the lowest colorectal andbreast cancer incidence (colorectal: women: ASIR = 0.14; men: ASIR = 0.18;breast: ASIR = 1.00) compared to long-term residents during the study period(colorectal: women: ASIR = .57; men: ASIR = .72; breast cancer ASIR = 1.61). Inmultivariate analyses, neighboorhood income did not consistently play asignificant role in colorectal cancer incidence; however higher neighbourhoodincome was a risk factor for breast cancer among immigrant women (adjustedrelative risk for highest neighboorhood income quintile versus lowest incomequintile =1.21, 95% CI = 1.18-1.24). Increased length of stay was associated withhigher risk of cancer. After adjusting for age, neighborhood income, and lengthof stay, those born in Europe and Central Asia had the highest risk of colorectalcancer compared to those born in East Asia and Pacific and those born in theMiddle East had the greatest additional risk of breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: After correcting for age, breast and colorectal cancer incidencerates among immigrants differ according to their region of birth and recentimmigrants to Ontario have lower colorectal and breast cancer incidence ratesthan their native-born peers. However, those advantages diminish over time. Thesefindings call for Ontario to generate tools and interventions to maintain thehealth of the immigrant population, particularly for those groups with a higherincidence of cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4444-0 PMCID: PMC5941319PMID: 29739346
