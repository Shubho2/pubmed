Unbiased proteomics of the mammary tumors fromcontrol- and WA-treated MMTV-neu mice revealed downregulation of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (Pin1) protein by WA administration. The present studyextends these findings to elucidate the role of Pin1 in cancer chemopreventivemechanisms of WA. The mammary tumor level of Pin1 protein was lower by about 55% in WA-treated rats exposed to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, compared to control.Exposure of MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cells to WA resulted indownregulation of Pin1 protein. Ectopic expression of Pin1 attenuated G2 and/ormitotic arrest resulting from WA treatment in both MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 cells.WA-induced apoptosis was increased by Pin1 overexpression in MCF-7 cells but not in the SK-BR-3 cell line. In addition, molecular docking followed by massspectrometry indicated covalent interaction of WA with cysteine 113 of Pin1.Overexpression of Pin1C113A mutant failed to attenuate WA-induced mitotic arrest or apoptosis in the MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, antibody array revealedupregulation of proapoptotic insulin-like growth factor binding proteins(IGFBPs), including IGFBP-3, IGFBP-4, IGFBP-5, and IGFBP-6, in Pin1overexpressing MCF-7 cells following WA treatment when compared to empty vectortransfected control cells. These data support a crucial role of the Pin1 formitotic arrest and apoptosis signaling by WA at least in the MCF-7 cells.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/mc.22814 PMCID: PMC5986602 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29603395
