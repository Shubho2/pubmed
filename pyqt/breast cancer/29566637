Virtual screening of heterocyclic compound library in conjugation with the agonist-competition assay, toxicity-carcinogenicityanalysis, and string-based structural searches enabled us to identify severaldrugs as potential anti-cancer agents targeting protein kinase C (PKC) as atarget. Molecular modeling study indicates that Cinnarizine fits well within the PKC C2 domain and exhibits extensive interaction with the protein residues.Molecular dynamics simulation of PKC-Cinnarizine complex at differenttemperatures (300, 325, 350, 375, and 400[Formula: see text]K) confirms thatCinnarizine fits nicely into the C2 domain and forms a stable complex. The drugCinnarizine was found to bind PKC with a dissociation constant Kd of [Formula:see text]M. The breast cancer cells stimulated with Cinnarizine causestranslocation of PKC-[Formula: see text] to the plasma membrane as revealed byimmunoblotting and immunofluorescence studies. Cinnarizine also dose dependently reduced the viability of MDAMB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells with anIC[Formula: see text] of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]g/mL,respectively. It is due to the disturbance of cell cycle of breast cancer cellswith reduction of S-phase and accumulation of cells in G1-phase. It disturbsmitochondrial membrane potentials to release cytochrome C into the cytosol andactivates caspase-3 to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. The cell death was dueto induction of apoptosis involving mitochondrial pathway. Hence, the currentstudy has assigned an additional role to Cinnarizine as an activator of PKC andpotentials of the approach to identify new molecules for anti-cancer therapy.Thus, in silico screening along with biochemical experimentation is a robustapproach to assign additional roles to the drugs present in the databank foranti-cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1142/S0219720018500026 PMID: 29566637
