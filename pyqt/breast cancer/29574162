Eighty percent of bone metastases come fromcarcinomas of the breast, lung, kidney, thyroid and prostate. The Katagiri scale enables an estimation of the survival of patients based on the presence orabsence of visceral metastases, multiple bone metastases and functional statusaccording to the ECOG scale.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive and observational studyconducted between March 1, 2013 and June 30, 2015. Thirty-two patients werestudied with a diagnosis of metastatic bone disease and who had undergone sometype of orthopaedic surgical treatment for pathological fracture or impendingfracture.RESULTS: 28 cases (87.5%) presented pathological fracture and 4 cases (12.5%)impending fracture according to the Mirels score. Fifteen cases (46.875%) weretreated by placing a central medullary nail + spacer in the long bone diaphysis, 15 cases (46.875%) with modular arthroplasties and 2 patients (6.25%) withforequarter amputation. Eleven patients (34.375%) died during the course of this study, all with a Katagiri greater than or equal to 4.DISCUSSION: The presence of a fracture in previously damaged territory is acatastrophic complication for most cancer patients. A clear understanding of the life expectancy of patients with bone metastases is of great help to preventerrors and failures in treatment.Copyright © 2018 SECOT. Publicado por Elsevier España, S.L.U.
