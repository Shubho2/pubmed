Epub 2012 May1.Resolving Post-Abortion Health Issues Using Available Statistical Data.Carroll PS(1).Author information: (1)PAPRI, the Pension and Population Research Institute, London.The myth of "safe" abortion continues despite a large and growing body ofresearch linking induced abortion to preterm birth, breast cancer, depressivedisorders, and other sequelae. After forty years of legally induced abortion,some comprehensive data sets exist in several countries. European data fromseveral countries including England, Wales, Scotland, and the Scandinaviannations is more comprehensive than that available in the United States. There is a full count of legal induced abortions along with age and other demographicdetails. To investigate effectively the medical and social impact of abortion on a population, the demographic pattern and profile of modern abortion providesuseful information in situations in which the methods of Bradford Hill aredifficult to apply. Demographic grouping of women with higher rates of abortion, such as black American women, who have a threefold higher abortion rate thanCaucasian American women, facilitates inferences from correlation analysis inecological studies. Consideration of the sequence of abortion in parity historyallows investigation of specific disorders such as breast cancer, which is linkedmost strongly to termination of nulliparous pregnancies. While a large amount of research has established the linkage between induced abortion and subsequentpreterm birth, potential exists for more precise delineation of the interactionbetween known risk factors.DOI: 10.1179/002436312803571348 PMCID: PMC6026969PMID: 30082970
