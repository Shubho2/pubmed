[Epub ahead of print]A copula model for joint modeling of longitudinal and time-invariant mixedoutcomes.Kürüm E(1), Jeske DR(1), Behrendt CE(2), Lee P(3).Author information: (1)Department of Statistics, University of California, Riverside, CA.(2)Division of Biostatistics, Department of Information Sciences, BeckmanResearch Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA.(3)Department of Immuno-Oncology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center,Duarte, CA.Motivated by a preclinical study in a mouse model of breast cancer, we suggest a joint modeling framework for outcomes of mixed type and measurement structures(longitudinal versus single time/time-invariant). We present an approach based onthe time-varying copula models, which is used to jointly model longitudinaloutcomes of mixed types via a time-varying copula, and extend the scope of these models to handle outcomes with mixed measurement structures. Our framework allowsthe parameters corresponding to the longitudinal outcome to be time varying andthereby enabling researchers to investigate how the response-predictorrelationships change with time. We investigate the finite sample performance ofthis new approach via a Monte Carlo simulation study and illustrate itsusefulness by an empirical analysis of the motivating preclinical study,comparing the effect of various treatments on tumor volume (longitudinalcontinuous response) and the number of days until tumor volume triples(time-invariant count response). Through the real-life application and thesimulation study, we demonstrate that, compared with marginal modeling, the jointmodeling framework offers more precision in the estimation of model parameters.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/sim.7855 PMID: 29961946
