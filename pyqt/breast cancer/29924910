[Epub ahead of print]Differentiating Antiproliferative and Chemopreventive Modes of Activity forElectron-Deficient Aryl Isothiocyanates against Human MCF-7 Cells.Anderson RH(1), Lensing CJ(1), Forred BJ(2), Amolins MW(1)(2), Aegerter CL(2),Vitiello PF(2), Mays JR(1).Author information: (1)Department of Chemistry, Augustana University, 2001 South Summit Avenue, SiouxFalls, SD, 57197, USA.(2)Environmental Influences on Health and Disease Group, Sanford Research, 2301East 60th Street North, Sioux Falls, SD, 57104, USA.The consumption of Brassica vegetables provides beneficial effects throughorganic isothiocyanates (ITCs), products of the enzymatic hydrolysis ofglucosinolate secondary metabolites. The ITC l-sulforaphane (l-SFN) is theprinciple agent in broccoli that demonstrates several modes of anticancer action.While the anticancer properties of ITCs like l-SFN have been extensively studied and l-SFN has been the subject of multiple human clinical trials, the scope ofthis work has largely been limited to those derivatives found in nature. Previousstudies have demonstrated that structural changes in an ITC can lead to markeddifferences in a compound's potency to 1) inhibit the growth of cancer cells, and2) alter cellular transcriptional profiles. This study describes the preparation of a library of non-natural aryl ITCs and the development of a bifurcatedscreening approach to evaluate the dose- and time-dependence on antiproliferativeand chemopreventive properties against human MCF-7 breast cancer cells.Antiproliferative effects were evaluated using a commercial MTS cell viabilityassay. Chemopreventive properties were evaluated using an antioxidant responseelement (ARE)-promoted luciferase reporter assay. The results of this study have led to the identification of 1) several key structure-activity relationships and 2) lead ITCs for continued development.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
