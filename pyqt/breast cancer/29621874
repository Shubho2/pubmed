The disease-free breastcancer survivors were defined as those who were ≥2 years from initial diagnosisof breast cancer who had completed treatment. Females without a history of cancerwere randomly selected at 1:4 ratio by 5-year age groups, education, andhousehold income as a comparison group. We analyzed results from the PsychosocialWell-being Index-Short Form (PWI-SF) as a psychosocial health measurement.Results: A total of 347 survivors of breast cancer and 1,388 matched controlswere included. Total scores on the PWI-SF were lower in breast cancer survivorsthan matched non-cancer controls (p=0.006), suggesting a lower level ofpsychosocial stress in breast cancer survivors. In comparison to the controlgroup, prevalence of drinking, smoking and obesity were lower, while exercisingfor ≥150 min/wk was higher in breast cancer survivors (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that breast cancer survivors have better health behaviors than theirnon-cancer controls. After adjusting for other sociodemographic variables, breastcancer survivors were 36% less likely to be included in the stress group (oddsratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.98).Conclusion: The disease-free breast cancer survivors resuming daily lifedemonstrated better psychosocial health status compared to matched non-cancercontrols.DOI: 10.4143/crt.2017.585 PMID: 29621874
