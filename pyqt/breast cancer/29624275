Acta Pol Pharm. 2017 Mar;74(2):688-698.ANTIOXIDANT AND CANCER CHEMOPREVENTIVE ACTIVITIES OF CISTUS AND POMEGRANATEPOLYPHENOLS.Moreira H, Slezak A, Szyjka A, Oszmianski J, Gasiorowski K.Polyphenol rich extracts obtained from cistus herb (Cistus incanus L.) andpomegranate peel (Punica granatum L.) exhibited significant antioxidant activity in V79 cell culture (Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts) -cistus extract reducedintracellular content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 30-40% and pomegranate extract by 29-36%. In human breast (MCF-7) and colon (LOVO) cancer cell linescistus and pomegranate extracts decreased cancer cell growth both indrug-sensitive cells by 15-30% and in drug resistant (doxorubicin-resistant; DX) sublines by 5-20%. However, the extracts did not influence on cell growth%fnormal hamster fibroblast cultures (V79). The extracts induced apoptosis in thetested cancer cell lines. Significantly higher proapoptotic impact of theextracts was observed in drug-sensitive than in drug-resistant sublines. Theresults suggest potential usefulness of the tested polyphenol rich extracts inpeople exposed to oxidative stress. Their potential use as adjuvant therapy ofhuman cancers needs further studies.PMID: 29624275  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
