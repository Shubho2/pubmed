The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assayestimates the risk of distant recurrence and chemotherapy benefit in early-stage,ER+/HER2- female breast cancer. We assessed the association between RS and typeof treatment in male breast cancer.METHODS: We identified male patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer and availableRS results treated at our institution in 2006-2016. We collected data onclinicopathologic features, treatment, and outcome. The Institutional ReviewBoard approved the study.RESULTS: The study cohort consists of 38 male breast cancer patients with amedian age of 70 years. Median tumor size was 1.6 cm, and 81.6% (31) werenode-negative. RS was low (≤ 17) in 26 (68.4%) cases, intermediate (18-30) in 9(23.7%) cases, and high (≥ 31) in 3 (7.9%) cases, comparable to that in femalepatients at our institution. All patients underwent total mastectomy, and onereceived radiotherapy. Thirty-four (89.5%) patients received adjuvant endocrinetherapy, mostly tamoxifen (81.6%; 31). Five (13.2%) patients with intermediate orhigh RS were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. No locoregional recurrence wasobserved, and one patient developed distant recurrence (median follow-up 34months).CONCLUSIONS: The RS distribution in male breast cancers was similar to that infemales treated at our institution. With limited follow-up, patients with low RS were spared chemotherapy and did not develop recurrence. Our results suggest thatthe RS may have a clinical utility in male breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6411-z PMCID: PMC5930124 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29520654
