In the present study, we show that a short time exposure (3 h) to Triptolide,which did not trigger apoptosis, could specifically increase breast cancer cells sensitivity to Doxorubicin rather than other chemotherapy drugs includingPaclitaxel, Fluorouracil, and Mitomycin C. Further studies revealed Triptolidedownregulated ATM expression and inhibited DNA damage response to DNA double-strand breaks. Moreover, the chemosensitization effect to Doxorubicin fromTriptolide was attenuated by overexpression of ATM in breast cancer cells. Ourfindings suggest that Triptolide specifically chemosensitizes breast cancer cellsto Doxorubicin prior to apoptosis initiation through downregulating ATMexpression and inhibiting DNA damage response.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/mc.22795 PMID: 29500880
