The discovery of different intrinsic subtypes ofbreast cancer has advanced the understanding of breast cancer, with gene-basedassays shedding further light on tumor behavior and response to treatment.DESIGN: This review focuses on the landscape of the luminal A subtype, itsdefinition based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene assays, the prognosticand predictive value of these assays, guideline recommendations, and treatmentimplications.RESULTS: Clinical studies of the prognostic value of gene-based and IHC-basedassays in patients with luminal A-subtype breast cancers suggest a betterprognosis for these patients compared with those with breast cancers of othersubtypes.CONCLUSION: In today's era of precision medicine, the best treatment regimen for patients with luminal A-subtype tumors is still undetermined, but available data raise the question whether chemotherapy can be omitted and endocrine therapyalone is sufficient for this patient population.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Immunohistochemical markers have traditionally guided treatment decisions in breast cancer. However, advances in gene-expressionprofiling and availability of gene-based assays have launched these newer testsinto everyday clinical practice. Luminal A-subtype tumors are a unique subsetthat may have favorable tumor biology. Properly defining this tumor subtype isimportant and may identify a subset of patients for whom endocrine therapy alone is sufficient.Â© AlphaMed Press 2018.DOI: 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0535 PMCID: PMC5947456 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29472313
