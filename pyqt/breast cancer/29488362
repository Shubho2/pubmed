We examined 53 tumors from 44 patients. Total hemoglobin concentration (tHb), SO2, and μs' were measured by time-resolved spectroscopy (TRS). Theskin-to-chest wall distance and the size and depth of tumors were measured byultrasonography. There was a positive correlation between tHb and tumorthickness, and a negative correlation between tHb and tumor depth. SO2 in breast tissue decreased when the skin-to-chest wall distance decreased, and SO2 intumors tended to be lower than in breast tissue. In breast tissue, there was anegative correlation between μs' and the skin-to-chest wall distance, and μs' in tumors was higher than in breast tissue. Measurement of tHb in breast cancer byTRS was influenced by tumor thickness and depth. Although SO2 seemed lower andμs' was higher in breast cancer than in breast tissue, the skin-to-chest walldistance may have affected the measurements.(2018) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).DOI: 10.1117/1.JBO.23.2.026010 PMID: 29488362
