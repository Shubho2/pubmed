The current study seeks toextend these findings to physical symptom burden, examining differences insymptom self-rating and perception of partner symptoms.METHODS: Couples were approached while waiting for an integrative oncologyservice. Fifty patients and their partners completed the Edmonton SymptomAssessment Scale (ESAS-FS; twelve symptoms, scores 0-10, 10 worst possible) and aGlobal Health measure (PROMIS10). Patient and partner each also completed theESAS-FS as it related to their perception of the other's symptoms. ESAS distress subscales analyzed included Global (GDS), Psychosocial (PSS), and Physical (PHS).Analyses included paired t tests to examine all measures.RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent of patients were female with most common cancerdiagnoses of breast (22%), gastrointestinal (16%), and thoracic/H&N (16%). ForESAS-FS self-ratings, patients had significantly higher physical distress thanpartners, with a no significant difference in psychosocial distress. For PROMIS10self-ratings, patients reported significantly lower global health and physicalhealth, (p's < 0.001); no differences were found for mental health betweenpatients and caregivers. Patient rating of partner physical distress (PHS,p = 0.01) was significantly higher than partner self-rating, with no significant difference observed in ratings for psychosocial distress. Partner rating ofpatient psychosocial distress (PSS, p < 0.001) and physical distress (PHS,p = 0.001) was significantly higher than that of patient self-rating.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that both patients and partners perceivephysical distress of the other higher than self; however, patients may be moresensitive to psychosocial distress in their partners.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4298-7 PMID: 29948392
