In aprevious study, we reported that TRAF3IP3 levels were substantially increased in the vasculature of breast cancer tissues, suggesting a proangiogenic role. Inthis study, we investigated TRAF3IP3 tumorigenic function. TRAF3IP3 protein waspresent in several cancer cell lines, with highest levels in melanoma. Inaddition, tumor microarray analysis on 23 primary melanoma and nine positivelymph nodes revealed that 70% of human primary melanoma and 66% of lymph nodemetastases were positive for TRAF3IP3. Importantly, TRAF3IP3 downregulationcorrelated with an 83% reduction of tumor growth in a subcutaneous xenograftmouse model (n=10, P=0.005). Immunohistochemistry analysis of the tumors revealedthat TRAF3IP3-shRNA tumors had increased apoptosis (n=4, P<0.01) and reducedmicrovascular density (n=4, P<0.002). In addition, TRAF3IP3 downregulation inmalignant endothelial cells reduced tube formation in a Matrigel tube formationassay. In melanoma cells, decreased levels of TRAF3IP3 were also associated with reduced viability (n=4, P=0.03) and proliferation (n=3, P=0.03), together withincreased sensitivity to ultraviolet-induced apoptosis (n=4, P=0.0004).Furthermore, TRAF3IP3 downregulation correlated with increased amounts ofinterferon-γ. Interferon-γ inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis, thussuggesting a new pathway for TRAF3IP3 in cancer. Collectively, the association ofTRAF3IP3 with malignant properties of melanoma suggest a clinical potential fortargeted therapy.DOI: 10.1097/CMR.0000000000000440 PMID: 29553967
