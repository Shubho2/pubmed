The population of TT consists of over 1.3 million people with diverse ancestral and sociocultural backgrounds, both of which may influence cancer incidence and mortality. The objective of thisstudy was to examine incidence and mortality patterns and trends in TT.METHODS: Cancer surveillance data on 29,512 incident cancer cases reported to theDr. Elizabeth Quamina Cancer Registry (population-based cancer registry of TT)between 1995 and 2009 were analyzed. Age-standardized rates, overall and by sex, ancestry, and geography, were reported.RESULTS: The highest incidence and mortality rates were observed for cancersrelated to reproductive organs in women, namely, breast, cervical, and uterinecancers, and prostate, lung and colorectal cancers among men. Average incidencerates were highest in areas covered by the Tobago Regional Health Authority(TRHA) (188 per 100,000), while average mortality rates were highest in areascovered by the North West Regional Health Authority (108 per 100,000). Nationals of African ancestry exhibited the highest rates of cancer incidence (243 per100,000) and mortality (156 per 100,000) compared to their counterparts who were of East Indian (incidence, 125 per 100,000; mortality, 66 per 100,000) or mixedancestry (incidence, 119 per 100,000; mortality, 66 per 100,000).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the need for national investment to improvethe understanding of the epidemiology of cancer in Trinidad and Tobago, and toultimately guide much needed cancer prevention and control initiatives in thenear future.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4625-x PMCID: PMC6032795PMID: 29973176
