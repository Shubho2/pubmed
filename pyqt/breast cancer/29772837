Between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015, 595 clinicalintermediate risk ER+ early stage breast cancer patients were enrolled. Hormonereceptor (HR) and HER2 receptor status were determined by conventional pathology using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).Ki67 was assessed in a subset of patients. The overall concordance between PS andMS for luminal type cancers (A and B together) was 98%. The concordance betweenPS and MS for luminal A and luminal B type cancers based on the Bloom Richardson histological grade (BR) (n = 586) or Ki67 (n = 185) was low: 64% (Kappa 0.20 [95%CI 0.11⁻0.28]) and 65% (Kappa 0.22 [95% CI 0.062⁻0.37]), respectively. In thisprospective study (NCT02209857) of a selection of ER+ and predominantly HER2-early-stage breast cancer patients, the additional ability of the 80-GS todistinguish between luminal, HER2-type and basal-like cancers was inherently verylimited. The distinction of luminal-type tumors into A and B according to Ki67status or BR grade versus the 70-GS revealed poor concordance.DOI: 10.3390/genes9050261 PMCID: PMC5977201PMID: 29772837
