Patient demographic and clinical characteristics at the timeof diagnosis, subsequent treatment patterns, and survival outcomes were analyzed.HRU and costs for the first 3 months after diagnosis, the last 3 months of life, and the time in between are summarized. All analyses were stratified by American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of disease.RESULTS: There were 1244 patients newly diagnosed with advanced TNBC; themajority were aged ≥75 years (61% with stage III disease and 57.4% with stage IV disease) and white (>70% of patients in both disease stage groups). The mostcommon treatment approaches were surgery combined with chemotherapy for patients for stage III disease (50.6%) and chemotherapy alone or with radiotherapy forpatients with stage IV disease (31.3%). Diverse chemotherapy regimens wereadministered for each line of therapy; nevertheless, the medications used wereconsistent with national guidelines. Patients with stage III and stage IV diseasewere found to have a similar mean number of hospitalizations and outpatientvisits, but mean monthly costs were greater for patients with stage IV disease atall 3 time points. The mean cost per patient-month (in 2013 US dollars) was $4810for patients with stage III disease and $9159 for patients with stage IV disease.CONCLUSIONS: Among older women with advanced TNBC, significant treatmentvariations and considerable HRU and costs exist. Further research is needed tofind effective treatments with which to reduce the clinical and economic burdenof this disease.
