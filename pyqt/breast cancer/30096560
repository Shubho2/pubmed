We have approached this problem by integrating antibacterial properties and X-ray contrast enhancement ina single probe specific to colonies of Streptococcus mutans as the mostpredominant and carious oral bacteria. We report the synthesis of an inherentlytherapeutic polymeric silane conjugated hafnium oxide nanoparticles (Hf PS NPs). Using a high-affinity pathogen-selective peptide, the concept of molecularlytargeted X-ray imaging of cariogenic pathogen S. mutans was demonstrated. Ex vivostudies using extracted human tooth demonstrated striking X-ray attenuation ofNPs vs. tooth. Additionally, Hf PS NPs exhibited significant bactericidalproperties against cariogenic pathogen. Electron microscopy revealed that theantibacterial activity occurred via a 'latch and kill' mechanism. Mechanisticstudies determined that these NPs fragmented bacterial DNA components to exerttheir antimicrobial effect. Importantly, Hf PS NPs effectively inhibited thegrowth of a mature biofilm on an ex vivo human tooth model. Finally, the NPs wereapplied to the rodent model of dental biofilm. Topical administration of the HfPS NPs for 8 days (1X daily) could effectively attenuate the S. mutans biofilmchallenge. This report is the first of its kind to demonstrate that HfO2-basedNPs can be used for simultaneous diagnosis and antibacterial treatment withoutrequiring an additional drug.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
