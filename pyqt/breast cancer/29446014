Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 BCS whoreturned to work following diagnosis and/or primary cancer treatment. AnInterpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to investigate responses.Results Three recurring themes emerged: (1) challenges at work related toresidual effects of diagnosis and/or primary treatment; (2) positive and negativeresponses from employers and/or supervisors; and (3) positive and negativeresponses from co-workers/colleagues. Although several participants experienced ahigh level of workplace support, there was a subgroup that did report challenges related to symptom burden, cognitive limitations, and both positive and negative responses by employers and co-workers were reported. Conclusions Findingsindicate similar challenges in BCS who RTW during and/or following cancertreatment in both rapidly developing and developed nations. Results suggest that regardless of the existence of workplace policies and practices related to RTWfor workers with a history of cancer, a subgroup of BCS experience similarchallenges when returning to work. These findings highlight the internationalnature of RTW challenges and suggest the need for more global efforts to develop and evaluate workplace interventions to assist with these similarities.DOI: 10.1007/s10926-018-9762-1 PMID: 29446014
