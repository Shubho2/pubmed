Here, weinvestigated and compared the association between systemic inflammatory markersand survival and developed a prognostic nomogram in breast cancer patients. Wereviewed the clinical and pathological records of 661 patients diagnosed withinvasive breast carcinoma between 1993 and 2011. The NLR, dNLR, PLR and LMR inthe immediate preoperative period were assessed. We analyzed the relationshipbetween these inflammatory markers and clinicopathologic variables,disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients. Anomogram was developed to predict 3- and 5-year DSS for breast cancer. In theunivariate analysis, high NLR, dNLR, PLR and low LMR were all significantlyassociated with poor DSS and DFS. In the multivariate analysis, only the PLR (HR 3.226, 95% CI 1.768-5.885 for DSS and HR 1.824, 95% CI 1.824-6.321 for DFS) wasstill identified as an independent predictor of outcomes. A subgroup analysisrevealed that the PLR was the sole independent marker predicting poor DSS inpatients with lymph node metastasis (HR 2.294, 95% CI 1.102-4.777) and withluminal subtype (HR 4.039, 95% CI 1.905-8.562). The proposed nomogram, whichincludes the PLR, shows good accuracy in predicting DSS with a concordance index of 0.82. PLR is an indicator of systemic inflammation as a part of the hostimmune response. As an independent prognostic factor, an elevated preoperativePLR is superior to the NLR, dNLR, and LMR in predicting clinical outcomes inpatients with breast cancer. Moreover, the nomogram incorporating the PLR couldaccurately predict individualized survival probability in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200936 PMCID: PMC6062056PMID: 30048474
