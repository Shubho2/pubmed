Electronic address: yihongwang@seu.edu.cn.Five thiosemicarbazone ligands were synthesized and characterized by condensationwith different aldehydes or ketones by 4-phenylthiosemicarbazone. Therepresentativedichlorido[2-(Di-2-pyridinylmethylene)-Nphenylhydrazinecarbothioamide-N,N,S]-gallium(III) (Ga4) was characterized by X-ray single crystal diffraction, which was1:1 ligand/Ga(III) complexes. The structure-activity relationship of theseligands and Ga (III) complexes have been investigated, and the resultsdemonstrate that the formation of Ga (III) complexes have significantantiproliferative activity over the corresponding ligands. The anticancermechanism of gallium (III) complexes has been studied in detail, which is typicalagents that effect on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The ability of gallium(III) complexes to inhibit the cell cycle does not enhanced with the increasingconcentrations, whereas the ability to promote apoptosis isconcentration-dependent.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
