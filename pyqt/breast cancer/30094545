In this study, it was postulated thatradiopharmaceuticals, added to bisphosphonates, could further decrease theincidence of SREs.METHODS: NRG Oncology RTOG 0517 randomized patients with breast, lung, andprostate cancer and blastic bone metastases to either zoledronic acid (ZA) alone or ZA plus radiopharmaceuticals (Sr-89 or Sm-153). The primary endpoint was time to development of SREs. Secondary objectives included quality of life (QOL), paincontrol, overall survival (OS), and toxicity.RESULTS: 261 patients (median age 68; 62% male; 55% prostate, 35% breast, 10%lung) were accrued between July 2006 and February 2011. The study closed earlydue to a lower than expected rate of SREs. 52 (42%) patients in the ZA arm and 49(40%) in the radiopharmaceutical arm experienced an SRE. Median time free of SREswas 29.9 and 27.4 months, respectively (p = 0.84). Median OS in the ZA arm andradiopharmaceutical arms was 32.1 and 26.9 months, respectively (p = 0.37). Coxproportional hazards regression model showed that primary disease site (lung) andnumber of bone metastases (> 2) had a negative impact on OS (p < 0.0001,p = 0.01, respectively). The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to ZA led to asignificant reduction in pain at 1 month based on BPI worst score (p = 0.02). No other group differences were noted for QOL or toxicity.CONCLUSION: The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to bisphosphonates did not altertime to SREs or OS for patients with breast, lung, prostate cancers and blasticbone metastases, although it was associated with significant pain reduction at1 month.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: This protocol (RTOG 0517) is registered withClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00365105), and may be viewed online athttp://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00365105?term=RTOG+0517&rank=1 .DOI: 10.1007/s12149-018-1278-4 PMID: 30094545
