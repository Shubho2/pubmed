Our objective was to examine the role of patient-providerinteractions to help explain the relationship between race/ethnicity andcancer-specific physical well-being (PWB) among women with breast cancer.METHODS: The Pathways Study is a prospective cohort study of 4505 women diagnosedwith breast cancer at Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2006 and2013. Our analysis included white, black, Hispanic, and Asian participants whocompleted baseline assessments of PWB, measured using the Functional Assessmentof Cancer Therapy for Breast Cancer, and patient-provider interactions, measured by the Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey (IPC) (N = 4002). Using step-wiselinear regression, we examined associations of race/ethnicity with PWB, andchanges in associations when IPC domains were added.RESULTS: We observed racial/ethnic differences in PWB, with minorities reporting lower scores than whites (beta, black: - 1.79; beta, Hispanic: - 1.92; beta,Asian: - 1.68; p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). With the addition of health anddemographic covariates to the model, associations between race/ethnicity and PWB score became attenuated for blacks and Asians (beta: - 0.63, p = 0.06; beta:- 0.68, p = 0.02, respectively) and, to a lesser extent, for Hispanic women(beta: - 1.06, p = 0.0003). Adjusting for IPC domains did not affectHispanic-white differences (beta: - 1.08, p = 0.0002), and slightly attenuatedblack-white differences (beta: - 0.51, p = 0.14). Asian-white differencesnarrowed substantially (beta: - 0.31, p = 0.28).CONCLUSIONS: IPC domains, including those capturing perceived discrimination,respect, and clarity of communication, appeared to partly explain PWB differencesfor black and Asian women. Results highlight opportunities to improve providers' interactions with minority patients, and communication with minority patientsabout their supportive care needs.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4776-0 PMID: 29623576
