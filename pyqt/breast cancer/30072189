A high TMB (TMB-H) tumor is defined as onewith high somatic mutational rates, which correlates with clinical responses tocertain treatments such as immunotherapies. We determined TMB in lungadenocarcinoma and clarified the characteristics of patients with TMB-H inrelation to common driver mutations and smoking history.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic aberrations and TMB were determined in Japanesepatients with lung adenocarcinoma (n = 100) using next-generation sequencing of415 known cancer genes. TMB-H was defined as > 20 mutations per megabase (Mb) of sequenced DNA.RESULTS: The median TMB was 13.5 (5-33) mutations/Mb. Ten of 100 (10%) patientsshowed TMB-H, and the others showed low TMB (TMB-L). Only two of 10 (20%)patients with TMB-H had one of the common driver mutations (ALK and ERBB2mutation), whereas 57 of 90 (63%) patients with TMB-L had one of the drivermutations, including ALK, EGFR, ERBB2, ROS, RET, and MET (P < 0.05). Notably, no EGFR mutation was observed in patients with TMB-H. Eight of 10 (80%) patientswith TMB-H had recent smoking history, whereas only 17 of 90 (19%) patients with TMB-L had recent smoking history (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: We found that TMB-H is associated with smoking history, whereasTMB-L is associated with the common driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma,which may impact treatment strategies for these patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
