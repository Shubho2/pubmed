[Epub ahead of print]Cancer/testis antigen-Plac1 promotes invasion and metastasis of breast cancerthrough Furin/NICD/PTEN signaling pathway.Li Y(1)(2), Chu J(1), Li J(1), Feng W(1), Yang F(1), Wang Y(1), Zhang Y(1), SunC(1), Yang M(1), Vasilatos SN(2), Huang Y(2), Fu Z(1)(3), Yin Y(1).Author information: (1)Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing MedicalUniversity, China.(2)Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center,University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA.(3)Nanjing Maternal and Child Health Medical Institute, Obstetrics and GynecologyHospital Affiliated of Nanjing Medical University, China.Placenta-specific protein 1 (Plac1) is a cancer/testis antigen that plays acritical role in promoting cancer initiation and progression. However, theclinical significance and mechanism of Plac1 in cancer progression remainelusive. Here, we report that Plac1 is an important oncogenic and prognosticfactor, which physically interacts with Furin to drive breast cancer invasion andmetastasis. We have shown that Plac1 expression positively correlates withclinical stage, lymph node metastasis, hormone receptor status, and overallpatient survival. Overexpression of Plac1 promoted invasion and metastasis ofbreast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation andimmunofluorescence cell staining assays revealed that interaction of Plac1 andFurin degraded Notch1 and generated Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) that couldinhibit PTEN activity. These findings are consistent with the results ofmicroarray study in MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing Plac1. A rescue study showed that inhibition of Furin and overexpression of PTEN in Plac1 overexpression cellsblocked Plac1-induced tumor cell progression. Taken together, our findingssuggest that functional interaction between Plac1 and Furin enhances breastcancer invasion and metastasis and the Furin/NICD/PTEN axis may act as animportant therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.© 2018 The Authors.
