Areas covered: This review gives an overview ofavailable preclinical and clinical data regarding olaparib, including itschemistry, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, andevidence supporting antitumor efficacy and safety profile in breast cancerpatients. Expert commentary: Olaparib improves progression-free survival ingermline BRCA mutated HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients as comparedto standard chemotherapy, with a manageable toxicity profile. Efficacy is ofclinical relevance especially in the context of triple negative breast cancer.However, several aspects, such as sequencing or combination of these agents with other anticancer agents and identification of appropriate biomarkers, still need to be clearly defined.DOI: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1458613 PMID: 29582690
