[Epub ahead of print]Complications in patients with unilateral breast cancer who undergo contralateralprophylactic mastectomy versus unilateral mastectomy.Huang J(1), Chagpar A(2).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,Connecticut.(2)Department of Surgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,Connecticut. Electronic address: anees.chagpar@yale.edu.BACKGROUND: The rate of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy has been increasingamong patients with unilateral breast cancer. There remains a paucity of dataregarding the impact of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy on duration of stayand complications requiring reoperation within 90 days of operation.METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of female unilateral breast cancerpatients who underwent a mastectomy at a large academic institution between July 2013 and July 2016 to determine the effect of contralateral prophylacticmastectomy on complications and hospital stay.RESULTS: A total of 471 patients were included in this cohort, 276 (58.6%) ofwhom had contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. The median patient age was 52years (range 22-90) and median tumor size was 1.1 cm (range 0-14.6 cm). Therewere 52 patients (11.0%) who had complications resulting in reoperation within 90days, including 18 instances of bleeding complications (3.8%), 9 infections(1.9%), 18 thrombosis/necrosis of flaps (3.8%), 17 skin breakdown/woundcomplications (3.6%), 2 seromas (0.4%), and 2 implant ruptures (0.4%). Thereoperation rate did not differ between patients undergoing contralateralprophylactic mastectomy and those who opted for unilateral mastectomy (11.2% vs10.8%, respectively; P = .99). Median duration of hospital stay for the overallcohort was 2 days. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy was associated with agreater hospital stay than unilateral mastectomy (median 3 vs 2 days; P < .001)and was a predictor of stays ≥2 days (odds ratio = 2.369; 95% confidenceinterval: 1.197-4.688; P = .013) independent of reconstruction and other factors associated with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.CONCLUSION: Compared to unilateral mastectomy, contralateral prophylacticmastectomy was associated with an increased hospital stays but not a greater90-day reoperation rate for complications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
