Email: uripharahap@usu.ac.idObjective: This study was carried out to investigate the antimigration activityof Zanthoxylum acanthopodium DC. in the 4T1 breast cancer cell line. Methods:Zanthoxylum acanthopodium DC. fruit powder was extracted by maceration methodwith n-hexane and ethylacetate solvents. Cytotoxicity and proliferation wereassessed using the MTT method and the cell cycle by flow cytometry. In addition, wound healing assays were conducted by a microscopic method, and expression ofCOX-2 and VEGFR-2 were determined using qRT-PCR. Results: The IC50 of theethylacetate fraction (EAF) was 48.1 ± 1.06 μg/mL. The EAE at a concentration 10 μg/mL with viable cells was 62.3 ± 0.28% after 72 h incubation, with accumulationin the G2-M phase, inhibition of cell migration in the wound healing assay, anddecrease in expression of COX-2 (0.62 ± 0.01) and VEGFR-2 (0.39 ± 0.003).Conclusion: The results reveal that an ethylacetate fraction of Zanthoxylumacanthopodium DC. fruits provides effective antimigration effects. Furtherstudies are now planned to assess the potential of the ethylacetate fraction toinhibit angiogenesis in breast cancer and determine underlying mechanisms.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.2.565 PMCID: PMC5980951PMID: 29481017
