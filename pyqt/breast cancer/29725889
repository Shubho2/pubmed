Currently, there are nobiomarkers that reliably define patients who will, or will not, benefit from the addition of a CDK 4/6 inhibitor to their endocrine therapy. Additional researchis needed to identify the optimal sequencing of CDK 4/6 inhibitors in relation toother therapies as well as the optimal duration of therapy; at present, evidence suggests that use in the upfront setting is better than waiting for a later line of therapy, or adding after endocrine therapy has started.CONCLUSIONS: Thus far, three CDK 4/6 inhibitors-palbociclib, ribociclib, and morerecently, abemaciclib-have been approved for use in the setting of HR+, HER2-,mBC.Â  The degrees to which these agents differ in terms of CDK4/6 affinity,side-effect profiles, dosing, degree of central nervous system (CNS) penetration,optimal use in combination with antiestrogen therapy, and across other subsets ofbreast cancer, remain an active area of investigation.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4783-1 PMID: 29725889
