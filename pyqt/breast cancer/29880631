Pharmacokinetics of substrate cocktail consisting ofpitavastatin (OATP1B substrate), rosuvastatin (OATP1B/BCRP/OAT3), sulfasalazine(BCRP), and talinolol (P-gp) were obtained in cynomolgus monkey-alone or incombination with transporter inhibitors. Single-dose rifampicin (30 mg/kg)significantly (P < 0.01) increased the plasma exposure of all four drugs, with a marked effect on pitavastatin and rosuvastatin [area under the plasmaconcentration-time curve (AUC) ratio ∼21-39]. Elacridar, BCRP/P-gp inhibitor,increased the AUC of sulfasalazine, talinolol, as well as rosuvastatin andpitavastatin. An OAT1/3 inhibitor (probenecid) significantly (P < 0.05) impacted the renal clearance of rosuvastatin (∼8-fold). In vitro, rifampicin (10 µM)inhibited uptake of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, and sulfasalazine by monkey andhuman primary hepatocytes. Transport studies using membrane vesicles suggestedthat all probe substrates, except talinolol, are transported by cynoBCRP, whereastalinolol is a cynoP-gp substrate. Elacridar and rifampicin inhibited bothcynoBCRP and cynoP-gp in vitro, indicating potential for in vivo intestinalefflux inhibition. In conclusion, a probe substrate cocktail was validated tosimultaneously evaluate perpetrator impact on multiple clinically relevanttransporters using the cynomolgus monkey. The results support the use of thecynomolgus monkey as a model that could enable drug-drug interaction riskassessment, before advancing a new molecular entity into clinical development, aswell as providing mechanistic insights on transporter-mediated interactions.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/dmd.118.081794 PMID: 29880631
