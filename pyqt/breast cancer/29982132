This study sought to compare these parameters between BRCA mutation carriers and non-carriers and to evaluate the potential implications of thefindings for short term follow-up.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging studies of known BRCA mutation carriers, were compared to age-matched non-carrier studies performed in the same center during the same period. The groups were compared for qualitativebackground parenchymal enhancement and amount of fibroglandular tissue using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).RESULTS: Breast parenchymal enhancement was high in up to one-third of thecohort: 22% of carriers and 33% of controls (p = 0.013). These results weresustained on separate analysis of menstrual-cycle-timed examinations. Amount offibroglandular tissue was high in most cases: 62% of carriers and 75% of controls(p = 0.004). A BI-RADS final assessment score of 3 was more common in patientswith high parenchymal enhancement, especially controls.CONCLUSION: BRCA mutation carriers demonstrated lower levels of breastparenchymal enhancement and amount of fibroglandular tissue than age-matchednon-carriers. These differences are probably influenced by hormonal status, aswell as highlight different risks in distinctive subgroups of breast cancer(hormone-enriched, mutation-associated defective DNA damage repair), affectingconsiderations of preventive medical treatment. Differences in the indicationsfor imaging between the carrier and non-carrier groups (screening for mutationsand breast cancer evaluation, respectively) probably accounted for the higherrate of BI-RADS 3 in the control group.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
