Primary outcome measures were the occurrence of neoplasmdiagnosis in exposed and non-exposed groups, reported to evaluate associationbetween cancer and periodontitis.RESULTS: Of the 490 initially retrieved papers 10 were included in thequalitative synthesis and eight in the quantitative synthesis; the eight paperscovered six studies. Considering hazard ratios, a statistically significantassociation was found for all cancers studied (1.14; CI 95%: 1.04, 1.24),digestive tract cancer (1.34; CI 95%: 1.05, 1.72), pancreatic cancer (1.74; CI95%: 1.21, 2.52), prostate cancer (1.25; CI 95%: 1.04, 1.51), breast cancer(1.11; CI 95%: 1.00, 1.23), corpus uteri cancer (2.20; CI 95%: 1.16, 4.18), lung cancer (1.24; CI 95%: 1.06, 1.45), hematological cancer (1.30; CI 95%: 1.11,1.53), esophagus / oropharyngeal cancer pooled together (2.25; CI 95%: 1.30,3.90) and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1.30; CI 95%: 1.11, 1.52).CONCLUSIONS: Despite the sparse scientific evidence and considering the lowstatistical power of the results, this systematic review revealed a substantiallack of studies with standardized and comparable methods to speculate about theassociation between periodontitis and cancer; more studies are need in order toexplore further the scientific evidence of such correlation.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195683 PMCID: PMC5903629PMID: 29664916  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
