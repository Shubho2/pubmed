From the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, The Johns Hopkins Hospital.BACKGROUND: Despite well-established correlation of postmastectomy radiotherapyand surgical complications in breast reconstruction, its impact on patientreported outcomes is less clear. We sought to determine the effect ofpostmastectomy radiotherapy on patient reported outcomes throughout the breastreconstruction process.METHODS: Patients undergoing prosthetic and autologous breast reconstruction fromNovember 2010 to June 2013 were prospectively followed with BREAST-Q surveys(preoperatively, after expander placement, and 6 and 12 months after finalreconstruction). Paired t test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and multiple linearregression were used to determine the effect of radiation on patient reportedoutcomes.RESULTS: Two hundred patients were included in the study, of which 51 (25.5percent) received postmastectomy radiotherapy. Prosthetic reconstruction wasperformed in 75 patients (37.5 percent), autologous reconstruction was performed in 118 (59 percent), and pure fat grafting was performed in seven (3.5 percent). At one-year follow-up, the nonirradiated group reported higher BREAST-Q scoreswhen compared with the irradiated group, in Satisfaction with Breasts (p =0.003), Psychosocial Well-being (p = 0.003), Sexual Well-being (p < 0.001),Physical Well-being of Chest (p = 0.024), and Satisfaction with Outcome (p =0.03). When accounting for baseline values, Satisfaction with Breasts andPhysical Well-being of Chest significantly worsened in irradiated patientsundergoing prosthetic reconstruction, an effect not seen with autologousreconstructions. All irradiated patients significantly worsened in PsychosocialWell-being and Sexual Well-being scores.CONCLUSIONS: Postmastectomy radiotherapy is associated with worse patientreported outcomes following breast reconstruction. Autologous reconstruction can mitigate patient dissatisfaction in some domains.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, II.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004105 PMID: 29481390  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
