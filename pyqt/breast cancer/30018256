The origins ofBCSCs remain controversial due to tumor heterogeneity and the presence of suchsmall side populations for study, but nonetheless, cell surface markers and theircorrelation with BCSC functionality continue to be identified. BCSCs are drivenby persistent activation of developmental pathways, such as Notch, Wnt, Hippo,and Hedgehog and new treatment strategies that are aimed at these pathways are inpreclinical and clinical development.DOI: 10.3390/biomedicines6030077 PMID: 30018256
