Eukaryotic acetyl-CoAcarboxylases are large, homodimeric multienzymes. Human acetyl-CoA carboxylaseoccurs in two isoforms: the metabolic, cytosolic ACC1, and ACC2, which isanchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane and controls fatty acidβ-oxidation1,3. ACC1 is regulated by a complex interplay of phosphorylation,binding of allosteric regulators and protein-protein interactions, which isfurther linked to filament formation1,4-8. These filaments were discovered invitro and in vivo 50 years ago7,9,10, but the structural basis of ACC1polymerization and regulation remains unknown. Here, we identify distinctactivated and inhibited ACC1 filament forms. We obtained cryo-electron microscopystructures of an activated filament that is allosterically induced by citrate(ACC-citrate), and an inactivated filament form that results from binding of the BRCT domains of the breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1). Whilenon-polymeric ACC1 is highly dynamic, filament formation locks ACC1 intodifferent catalytically competent or incompetent conformational states. Thisunique mechanism of enzyme regulation via large-scale conformational changesobserved in ACC1 has potential uses in engineering of switchablebiosynthetic systems. Dissecting the regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase opensnew paths towards counteracting upregulation of fatty acid biosynthesis indisease.DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0201-4 PMID: 29899443
