Previousliterature suggested that genetic variations in the MDM4 gene are associated withrisk of different cancers. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of 3 common genetic variants of MDM4, rs4245739 A>C, rs11801299 G>A, andrs1380576 C>G, on the risk of breast cancer (BC) in a southeast Iranianpopulation sample.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 265 BC patients and 221 healthy women wereincluded in this case-control study. We used polymerase chain reaction(PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism and tetra amplification refractorymutation system-PCR methods for detection of MDM4 polymorphisms.RESULTS: Our findings showed that rs1380576 C>G was associated with a reducedrisk of BC using co-dominant (GC vs. CC: odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% confidenceinterval [CI], 0.34-0.84; P = .006; and GG vs. CC: OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26-0.94;P = .044), dominant (CG+GG vs. CC: OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.82; P = .004), andallele models (G vs. C: OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.96; P = .025). However, ourstudy failed to show any relationship between rs4245739 A>C and rs11801299 G>Avariants and BC risk (P > .05). We also found no significant association between MDM4 variants and clinical characteristics of BC patients (P > .05).CONCLUSION: Our findings proposed that the MDM4 rs1380576 C>G polymorphism was a protective factor for BC risk in our population. Additional studies with largersample sizes and diverse ethnicities are required to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
