At first, the probe DNA covalently bindto the negatively charged gold nanoparticles (citrate-capped AuNPs). Then, thetarget miR-155 electrostatically adsorb onto the positively charged goldnanoparticles (polyethylenimine-capped AuNP) surface. Finally, by mixingcitrate-capped AuNP/probe and polyethylenimine-capped AuNP/miR-155, hybridizationoccurs and the optical signal of the mixture give a measure to quantify themiR-155 content. The proposed biosensor is able to specify 3-base-pair mismatchesand genomic DNA from target miR-155. The novelty of this biosensor is in itsability to trap the label-free target by its branched positively chargedpolyethylenimine. This method increases loading the target on thepolyethylenimine-capped AuNPs' surface. So, proposed sensor enables miR-155detection at very low concentrations with the detection limit of 100 aM and awide linear range from 100 aM to 100 fM.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-20229-z PMCID: PMC5811613PMID: 29440644
