Amplification and/orre-expression of Eyas occurs in many tumor types. In breast cancer, Eyas regulatetumor progression by acting as transcriptional cofactors and tyrosinephosphatases. Intriguingly, Eyas harbor a separate threonine (Thr) phosphataseactivity, which was previously implicated in innate immunity. Here we describewhat we believe to be a novel role for Eya3 in mediating triple-negative breastcancer-associated immune suppression. Eya3 loss decreases tumor growth inimmune-competent mice and is associated with increased numbers of infiltratedCD8+ T cells, which, when depleted, reverse the effects of Eya3 knockdown.Mechanistically, Eya3 utilizes its Thr phosphatase activity to dephosphorylateMyc at pT58, resulting in a stabilized form. We show that Myc is required forEya3-mediated increases in PD-L1, and that rescue of PD-L1 in Eya3-knockdowncells restores tumor progression. Finally, we demonstrate that Eya3 significantlycorrelates with PD-L1 in human breast tumors, and that tumors expressing highlevels of Eya3 have a decreased CD8+ T cell signature. Our data uncover a rolefor Eya3 in mediating tumor-associated immune suppression, and suggest that itsinhibition may enhance checkpoint therapies.DOI: 10.1172/JCI96784 PMCID: PMC5983346 [Available on 2018-09-01]PMID: 29757193
