Epub 2018 Feb 7.2',3'-Dideoxyuridine triphosphate conjugated to SiO2 nanoparticles: Synthesis andevaluation of antiproliferative activity.Vasilyeva SV(1), Grin IR(2), Chelobanov BP(2), Stetsenko DA(3).Author information: (1)Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Siberian Branch of theRussian Academy of Sciences, 8 Lavrentiev Avenue, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.Electronic address: svetlana2001@gmail.com.(2)Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Siberian Branch of theRussian Academy of Sciences, 8 Lavrentiev Avenue, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia;Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.(3)Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Siberian Branch of theRussian Academy of Sciences, 8 Lavrentiev Avenue, Novosibirsk 630090, Russia.A conjugate of triphosphorylated 2',3'-dideoxyuridine (ddU) with SiO2nanoparticles was obtained via the CuAAC click chemistry between a γ-alkynyl ddU triphosphate and azido-modified SiO2 nanoparticles. Assessment of cytotoxicity inhuman breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells demonstrated that ddU triphosphateconjugated to SiO2 nanoparticles exhibited a 50% decrease in cancer cell growthat a concentration of 183 ± 57 µg/mL, which corresponds to 22 ± 7 µM of theparent nucleotide, whereas the parent nucleoside, nucleotide and alkynyltriphosphate precursor do not show any cytotoxicity. The data provide an example of remarkable potential of novel conjugates of SiO2 nanoparticles withphosphorylated nucleoside analogues, even those, which have not been usedpreviously as therapeutics, for application as new anticancer agents.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
