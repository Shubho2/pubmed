[Epub ahead ofprint]Robust estimation in accelerated failure time models.Sinha SK(1).Author information: (1)School of Mathematics and Statistics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, K1S5B6, Canada. sinha@math.carleton.ca.The accelerated failure time model is widely used for analyzing censored survivaltimes often observed in clinical studies. It is well-known that the ordinarymaximum likelihood estimators of the parameters in the accelerated failure timemodel are generally sensitive to potential outliers or small deviations from the underlying distributional assumptions. In this paper, we propose and explore arobust method for fitting the accelerated failure time model to survival data by bounding the influence of outliers in both the outcome variable and associatedcovariates. We also develop a sandwich-type variance-covariance function forapproximating the variances of the proposed robust estimators. The finite-sample properties of the estimators are investigated based on empirical results from an extensive simulation study. An application is provided using actual data from aclinical study of primary breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1007/s10985-018-9421-z PMID: 29442279
