In thisstudy we characterized and compared the global gene expression profiles of TECsand control ECs isolated from human breast cancerous tissues and reductionmammoplasty tissues respectively by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Basedon the qualified scRNA-seq libraries that we made, we found that 1302 genes were differentially expressed between these two EC phenotypes. Both principalcomponent analysis (PCA) and heat map-based hierarchical clustering separated thecancerous versus control ECs as two distinctive clusters, and MetaCore diseasebiomarker analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes are highlycorrelated with breast neoplasm diseases. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis software(GSEA) enriched these genes to extracellular matrix (ECM) signal pathways andhighlighted 127 ECM-associated genes. External validation verified some of these ECM-associated genes are not only generally overexpressed in various cancertissues but also specifically overexpressed in colorectal cancer ECs and lymphomaECs. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that ECM-associated genes play pivotal roles in breast cancer EC biology and some of them could serve as potential TECbiomarkers for various cancers.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23760 PMCID: PMC5834272PMID: 29541388
