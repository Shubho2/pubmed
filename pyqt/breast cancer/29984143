We studied 8190 female and 13,440 male enrollees aged ≥40 years at survey completion (2015-2016),who had a medical visit during the preceding year, had no self-reported breast orprostate cancer, and did not have screening for non-routine purposes. We computedage-specific prevalence of mammography (among women) and PSA testing (among men),and compared to the general population using 2015 National Health InterviewSurvey data (NHIS). We also computed the adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) and 95%confidence interval (95% CI) to examine the relationship between 9/11 exposuresand screening uptakes using modified Poisson regression. Our enrollees had higherprevalences of mammogram and PSA testing than the US general population. 9/11exposure was not associated with mammography uptake. Proximity to the WTC at the time of the attacks was associated with PSA testing in the age 60-74 group(PR = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.00-1.12). Among rescue/recovery workers and volunteers(RRW), being a firefighter was associated with higher PSA testing than other RRW across all age groups (40-49: PR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.16-1.81; 50-59: PR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.22-1.44; 60-74: PR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.06-1.23). Screening activities should beconsidered when studying cancer incidence and mortality in 9/11 exposedpopulations.DOI: 10.1016/j.pmedr.2018.05.004 PMCID: PMC6030231PMID: 29984143
