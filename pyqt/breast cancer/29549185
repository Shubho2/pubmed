Theexpression of different OATP members has been reported in the kidney, liver,placenta, brain, and intestine. Because of their broad substrate spectra and widedistribution within the human body, these transporters have been proposed to playkey roles in the influx transport of many oral drugs. Inflammation is known toregulate the expression and functions of many drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters. As a proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) hasbeen shown to affect the expression of different drug transporters, includingOATP family members. In the present study, a putative nuclear factor-κB (NFκB)binding site ranging from -1845 to -1836 was identified at the proximal promoter region of OATP1A2 coding gene SLCO1A2 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays andchromatin immunoprecipitation showed that nuclear extracts from both breastcancer cell MCF7 and liver cancer cell HepG2 interacted with an oligonucleotideprobe containing the putative NFκB binding site and that the DNA-proteincomplexes contained both p65 and p50 subunits of NFκB. Further study revealedthat the binding site may be responsible in part for the suppression effect ofTNFα toward SLCO1A2 expression because the treatment of TNFα significantlyincreased. Treatment of TNFα significantly increased formation of the DNA-proteincomplexes and mutations at essential bases of the putative NFκB binding siteabolished responsiveness to the TNFα neutralizing antibody, suggesting that thebinding site may be responsible in part for the suppression effect of TNFα towarsSLCO1A2 expression.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/dmd.117.078832 PMID: 29549185
