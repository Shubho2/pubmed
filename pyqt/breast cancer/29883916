The complexes were designedwith a view to assess their potential anticancer, antioxidant and antibacterialactivity. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity(ADMET) properties of the chosen ligands were calculated by admetSAR software.Metabolic sites of different ligands likely to undergo metabolism were predicted using Metaprint 2D. The proposed complexes were also evaluated for theirdrug-like quality based on Lipinski's, Veber, Ghose and leadlikeness filters.Druglikeness and toxicity potential were predicted by OSIRIS property explorer.The pharmacokinetic properties and bioactivity scores were calculated byMolinspiration tool. Bioactivity scores of the complexes were predicted for drug targets including enzymes, nuclear receptors, kinase inhibitors, G-proteincoupled receptor ligands and ion channel modulators. Molecular docking ofselected Fe(II) mixed-ligand complexes was performed using AutoDock version 4.2.6and i-GEMDOCK version 2.1 with two target proteins namely Ribonucleotidereductase (RR) and Topoisomerase II (Topo II). The results were compared withthree standard reference drugs viz. Doxorubicin HCl, Letrozole (anticancer) andTetracycline (antibiotic). Multivariate data obtained were analyzed usingprincipal component analysis (PCA) for visualization and projection as scatterand 3D plots. Positive results obtained for hetero-ligands using admetSAR version1.0 indicated good absorption and transport kinetics of the hetero-ligandcomplexes through the human intestine and blood-brain barrier. The hetero-ligandswere predicted to have no associated mutagenic effect(s) also. However, none ofthe hetero-ligands was predicted to be Caco-2 (human colon cancer cell line)permeable. Most of the hetero-ligands and the parent ligand (2-butanonethiosemicarbazone) were predicted to undergo Phase-I metabolism prior toexcretion using MetaPrint2D software. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the proposed complexes revealed that all complexes displayed drug-like character and werepredicted to have no apparent toxic side-effects. All the proposed complexesshowed moderate to good biological activity scores (-5.0 to 0.0). Mixed complexeswith bpy, 2-picoline and 1,10-phenanthroline showed significant bioactivityscores (as enzyme inhibitors) in the range 0.02-0.13. Likewise, good dockingscores were obtained for Fe (II) complexes with the same ligands. [FeL(2-pic)2]displayed the lowest binding energy (-6.47 kcal/mol) with respect to Topo IIfollowed by [FeL(py)2] (-6.14 kcal/mol) as calculated by AutoDock version 4.2.6. With respect to binding with RR, [FeL(2--pic)2] again displayed the lowestbinding energy (-7.21 kcal/mol) followed by [FeL(py)2] (-5.96 kcal/mol). On thebasis of docking predictions and various other computational evaluations, fourmixed-ligand complexes of Fe in +2 oxidation state with py, bpy, 2--picoline and 1,10-phenanthroline were synthesized with 2-butanone thiosemicarbazone. All thesynthesized Fe complexes were characterized using various spectroscopictechniques and tested for their potential anticancer activity in vitro againsthuman breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB 231 and human lung carcinoma cell lineA549 cell line using MTT assay. [FeL(2-pic)2], [FeL(bpy)], and [FeL(py)2] werefound to exhibit significant antiproliferative activity with IC50 values in therange of 80-100 μM against breast and lung cancer cells. The synthesized Fecomplexes also displayed mild antioxidant activities. The synthesized and studiedFe complexes have the potential for development into future anticancer agents if analyzed and modified further for improvement of their ADMET, solubility andpermeability criteria set for potential drug-candidates.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
