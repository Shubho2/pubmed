The aim of the study was to evaluate the concentrations and activities of selectedhaemostatic parameters in the plasma of patients diagnosed with breast cancer(BrCa) and to make an attempt at finding associations with their levels andselected clinicopathological factors; clinical classification, histologicalgrading, and molecular subtype of BrCa. The study involved 145 Caucasianethnicity women. Eighty-five women aged 45-66 with primary BrCa without distantmetastases (M0). Inclusion criteria were as follows: histopathologicalexamination confirming the diagnosis of primary BrCa, without previousradiotherapy and chemotherapy. The control group consisted of 60, post-menopausalwomen, aged 45-68. Haemostatic profile expressed by concentrations and activitiesof tissue factor (TF) and its inhibitor (TFPI) as well as concentrations oftissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1(PAI-1) were measured applying immunoassay techniques. A significantly higherconcentration of PAI-1 was noted in patients with BrCa localized in the leftbreast. We observed significantly lower activity of TFPI and significantly higherconcentration of PAI-1 in the group of patients with invasive ductal carcinoma ascompared with invasive lobular carcinoma. A significantly higher concentration oft-PA in patients with pT2 BrCa in relation to pT1 cases was noted. Based oncomprehensive analysis of haemostatic profile depending on clinicopathologicalfeatures, we suggest that haemostatic parameters play crucial roles in invasionand metastases of malignant tumours.© 2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20171657 PMCID: PMC5874264PMID: 29475895
