Methods: Twenty-six consecutive female patientswith histologically proven breast cancer were analyzed (median age, 51 years;range, 34 - 83 years). Simulated dose-reduced PET images were generated byun-listing the list mode data on PET/MRI. The acquired 20 minutes PET frame wasreconstructed in 5 ways: a reconstruction of the first 2 minutes with 3iterations and 28 subsets for reference, and reconstructions simulating 100%,20%, 10%, 5% of the original dose. General image quality and artifacts (GIQ+A),image sharpness (IS), noise (N), and lesion detectability (LD) were analyzedusing a four-point scale. Qualitative parameters were compared by using thenon-parametric Friedman test for multiple samples and the Wilcoxon signed-ranktest for paired samples. Comparison of different groups of independent sampleswas performed using the Mann-Whitney-U-Test. Results: Overall, 355 lesions (71lesions with five different reconstructions each) were evaluted. The 20 minutesreconstruction with 100% injected dose showed the best results in all categories.In GIQ+A, IS and N the reconstructions with a simulated dose of 20% and 10% were significantly better than the 2 minutes reconstructions (p<=0.001). Furthermore, 20%, 10%, and 5% reconstructions did not yield different results compared to the 2 minutes reconstruction in LD of the primary lesion. Using 10% of the injecteddose a calculated mean dose of 22.6 +/- 5.5 MBq (range 17.9 - 36.9 MBq) wouldhave been applied, resulting in an estimated whole-body radiation burden of 0.5+/- 0.1 mSv (range 0.4 - 0.7 mSv). Conclusion: 10% of the standard dose of18F-FDG (reduction of up to 90%) results in clinically acceptable PET-imagequality in TOF PET/MRI. The calculated radiation exposure would be comparable to the effective dose of a single digital mammography. A reduction of radiationburden to this level might justify partial-body examinations with PET/MRI fordedicated indications.Copyright Â© 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.209007 PMID: 29880506
