The aim of the present study was to assess the utility of DWIusing a pooled analysis.Materials and Methods: Literature databases were searched prior to July 2017.Fifteen studies with a total of 1181 patients were included. The data wereextracted to perform pooled analysis, heterogeneity testing, threshold effecttesting, sensitivity analysis, publication bias analysis and subgroup analyses.Result: The methodological quality was moderate. Remarkable heterogeneity wasdetected, primarily due to a threshold effect. The pooled weighted values were a sensitivity of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 0.92), a specificity of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.86), a positive likelihood ratio of 4.1 (95% CI: 2.9, 5.9),a negative likelihood ratio of 0.16 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.24), and a diagnostic oddsratio of 26 (95% CI: 15, 46). The area under the receiver operator characteristiccurve was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.93). In the subgroup analysis, the pooledspecificity of change in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) subgroup washigher than that in the pre-treatment ADC subgroup (0.80 [95% CI: 0.71, 087] vs. 0.63 [95% CI: 0.52, 0.73], P = 0.027).Conclusions: DWI may be an accurate and nonradioactive imaging technique foridentifying pCRs to NAC in breast cancer. Nonetheless, there are a variety ofissues when assessing DWI techniques for estimating breast cancer responses toNAC, and large scale and well-designed clinical trials are needed to assess thetechnique's diagnostic value.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23195 PMCID: PMC5805538PMID: 29467952
