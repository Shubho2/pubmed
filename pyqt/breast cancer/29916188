Translational research in this topic has revealed targetsthat can be modulated in the clinical setting with new compounds and strategies. Like most of the tumors, breast cancer is considered a complex and heterogeneous disease in which host immune responses have been also recently demonstrated ofcritical relevance. T infiltrating lymphocyte measurement is suggested as apowerful new tool necessary to predict early breast cancer evolution, especially for the her2-positive and triple-negative subtypes. Other biomarkers in tissueand peripheral blood are under intense scrutiny to ascertain their eventual role as prognostic and/or predictive factors. This background has fueled the interest in developing clinical research strategies to test activity of modernimmunotherapy in breast cancer, which constitutes the main focus of this review.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1907-3 PMID: 29916188
