End user comfort is well addressed in literature for commercial products such as seats and hand tools but no data wasfound for medical devices. A commercial patient support device for breastradiotherapy was analysed and a relation was found between discomfort anduncompensated internal body forces. Derived from CT-images, simplified patientfree-body diagrams were analysed and pain and comfort evaluated. Subsequently, a new patient position was established and prototypes were developed. Patientcomfort- and prototype optimization was done through iterative prototyping. With this approach, we were able to compensate all internal body forces and establish a force neutral patient free-body diagram. This resulted in comfortable patientpositioning and favourable medical results.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.apergo.2018.05.002 PMID: 29885727
