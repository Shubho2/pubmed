Recently, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid mediatorgenerated by sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), has been shown to play an importantrole in lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in several types of cancer.However, the role of the lipid mediator in BTC has never been examined. Here wefound that S1P is elevated in BTC with the activation of ceramide-syntheticpathways, suggesting that BTC utilizes SPHK1 to promote lymphatic metastasis. We found that S1P, sphingosine and ceramide precursors such as monohexosyl-ceramide and sphingomyelin, but not ceramide, were significantly increased in BTC comparedto normal biliary tract tissue using LC-ESI-MS/MS. Utilizing The Cancer GenomeAtlas cohort, we demonstrated that S1P in BTC is generated via de novo pathwayand exported via ABCC1. Further, we found that SPHK1 expression positivelycorrelated with factors related to lymphatic metastasis in BTC. Finally,immunohistochemical examination revealed that gallbladder cancer with lymph node metastasis had significantly higher expression of phospho-SPHK1 than thatwithout. Taken together, our data suggest that S1P generated in BTC contributesto lymphatic metastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29144-9 PMCID: PMC6050292PMID: 30018456
