There is a limited amount ofresearch regarding the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on AR expression. Byexamining the expression of AR in patients with TNBC, the aim of the presentstudy is to explore the clinical significance of AR and provide evidence forAR-directed treatment in TNBC. A total of 188 patients with primary TNBC withcomplete medical records were included in this retrospective study. Tumorsections from 41 patients (21.8%) were positive for AR, which was more oftendetected in small tumors (P=0.042) and cases with no lymph node involvement(P=0.032). Among them, 102 were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Atotal of 17 patients (16.7%) exhibited pathological complete response. However,the patient response was irrelevant to AR expression. Matched pathologicaltissues before and after NAC were collected for 49 cases, suggesting anenrichment of AR-expressing tumors following chemotherapy (P=0.008). Furtheranalysis indicated that AR expression had no correlation with the disease-freeand overall survival of patients with general TNBC; rather, it predicted a poorsurvival of the patients with stage III TNBC in comparison with those at earlier stages (P=0.035). AR expression occurs more often in small TNBC tumors or incases with no lymph node metastasis. It is associated with a poor prognosis ofthe patients with advanced stages of tumors.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8548 PMCID: PMC5958876PMID: 29844843
