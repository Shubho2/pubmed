The codelivery of an antitumor drug and siRNA is an effective strategyrecently applied in overcoming P-gp-related MDR. In this study, a multifunctionaldrug delivery system with both pH-sensitive feature and active targetability was designed, in which MDR1-siRNA and DOX were successfully loaded. The resultingcarrier EphA10 antibody-conjugated pH-sensitive doxorubicin (DOX), MDR1-siRNAcoloading lipoplexes (shortened as DOX + siRNA/ePL) with high serum stability hadfavorable physicochemical properties. DOX + siRNA/ePL exhibited an incrementalcellular uptake, enhanced P-gp downregulation efficacy, as well as a better cell cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cell line/adriamycin drug-resistant(MCF-7/ADR) cells. The results of the intracellular colocalization studyindicated that DOX + siRNA/ePL possessed the ability for pH-responsive rapidendosomal escape in a time-dependent characteristic. Meanwhile, the in vivoantitumor activities suggested that DOX + siRNA/ePL could prolong the circulationtime as well as specifically accumulate in the tumor cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis after intravenous administration into the blood system. Thehistological study further demonstrated that DOX + siRNA/ePL could inhibit theproliferation, induce apoptosis effect, and downregulate the P-gp expression invivo. Altogether, DOX + siRNA/ePL was expected to be a suitable codelivery systemfor overcoming the MDR effect.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b01806 PMID: 29798663
