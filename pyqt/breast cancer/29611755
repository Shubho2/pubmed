Hormone therapy (HT)is generally the first option in the absence of compelling reasons forchemotherapy (e.g., rapidly progressive visceral disease). After failure offirst-choice HT, alternative HT options are usually attempted until hormoneresistance occurs and chemotherapy becomes the treatment of choice. The first twopatients presented herein experienced prolonged disease control with third-lineeribulin after two lines of HT. The third report involves a case of male breastcancer which typically presents as the HR+/HER2- phenotype. Eribulin in thesecond line provided prolonged clinical improvement and was well tolerated.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-0355 PMID: 29611755
