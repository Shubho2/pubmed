The subgroup analysis of mentioned polymorphism declared thesignificant correlation (p ≤ 0.05) of the positive abortion, regularmenstruation, positive human epidermal receptor-2 and positive estrogen receptor with BC susceptibility in CC genotype.CONCLUSION: The existence of a C-allele at miRNA 196a2(11614913) elevates women'sBC susceptibility in Azeri ethnicity in Iran.DOI: 10.2217/pme-2017-0088 PMID: 29965793
