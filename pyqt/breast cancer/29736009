A meta-analysis was undertaken on the proportion of cancers detected only by ultrasound, out of all screen-detected cancers, and the proportion ofwomen with negative mammography who were referred for assessment followingultrasound screening.RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies satisfied our inclusion criteria. The proportion of total cancers detected only by ultrasound was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.27-0.31),consistent with an approximately 40% increase in the detection of cancerscompared to mammography. In the studied populations, this translated into anadditional 3.8 (95% CI: 3.4-4.2) screen-detected cases per 1000mammography-negative women. About 13% (32/248) of cancers were in situ from 17studies with information on this subgroup. Ultrasound approximately doubled thereferral for assessment in three studies with these data.CONCLUSIONS: Studies have consistently shown an increased detection of breastcancer by supplementary ultrasound screening. An inclusion of supplementaryultrasound into routine screening will need to consider the availability ofultrasound and diagnostic assessment capacities.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0080-3 PMID: 29736009
