Methods BALB/c mice were immunized withpurified recombinant RecQ helicase from E.coli. Hybridoma technique was used togenerate the mAb against RecQ helicase. The chromosome karyotype analysis of the hybridoma cells was performed by colchicine blocking. The Ig subtype and titer ofmAb in ascitic fluid were determined by ELISA. The biological properties of mAbwere detected via Western blotting and fluorescence polarization.Immunofluorescence was used to detect the interactions of mAb with BLM, RecQ4 andRecQ5 helicases in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Immunohistochemistry wasapplied to detect the binding of mAb and RecQ helicase in K562 tumor cells andthe corresponding stem cells. Results One stable hybridoma cell line expressinganti-RecQ mAb was obtained and named 6H5. The number of chromosomes was from 94to 104, and Ig subtype was IgG1. The titer of 6H5 in ascitic fluid was 1Ã—10-7.The mAb could specifically recognize E. coli RecQ helicase and thus inhibit itsDNA binding activity. Besides, the mAb could also recognize BLM, RecQ4 and RecQ5 in MDA-MB-231 cells, and sensitively detect the expression of the RecQ helicasein K562 tumor cells and the corresponding stem cells. Conclusion The mAb against RecQ helicase was successfully prepared with a high titer and specificity.PMID: 29673459
