However, many Australian women areunaware of the significance of breast density as it is not routinely reported or discussed. In order to address this lack of knowledge, Australian breast cancerresearchers with expertise in mammographic density formed the InforMD alliance(INformation FORum on Mammographic Density) in 2016. The alliance is working toraise awareness of breast density with the goal of improving breast cancerdiagnosis and health outcomes for women. The InforMD website (www.InforMD.org.au)was launched in October 2016, coinciding with a major nationwide public awarenesscampaign by the alliance during breast cancer awareness month. The websitecontains unbiased, accurate, updated information on breast density. The websitealso provides summaries of major research articles in layperson language, recent news items related to breast density, links to relevant information for healthprofessionals, events, and feature articles. Members of the public and healthprofessionals can also subscribe for news updates. The interactive online Forumsection facilitates discussion between health professionals, scientists andmembers of the public. To increase online traffic to the website, Facebook(www.facebook.com/BeInforMD) and Twitter (https://twitter.com/BeInforMD_) pageswere launched in December 2016. Since its launch, InforMD has generatedconsiderable interest. The public awareness campaign reached over 7 millionAustralians through a combination of newspaper, TV, radio, and online news. Thewebsite has attracted 13,058 unique visitors and 30,353 page views (data as of19/12/2017). Breast cancer researchers have a significant role to play indisseminating information to the public on breast density. A combination ofmainstream and social media, together with a well-informed and updated website,has laid the groundwork for the InforMD alliance to reach a wide audience.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.807 PMCID: PMC5828674PMID: 29492101
