China.Liver metastasis from breast cancer has poor prognosis. We aimed at developing a reliable tool for making a distinction and prediction for liver metastasis inbreast cancer patients, thus helping clinical diagnosis and treatment. In thisstudy, totally 6238 patients from SEER database with known distant metastasisstatus and clinicopathologic variables were enrolled and divided randomly intotraining and validating groups. Logistic regression was used to screen variables and a nomogram was constructed. After multivariate logistic regression, sex,histology type, N stage, grade, age, ER, PR, HER2 status as significant variablesfor constructing the nomogram. The nomogram for distinguishing and predictingliver metastasis in breast cancer passed the calibration and validation steps andthe areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the training setand the validation set were 0.6602 and 0.6511 respectively. Our nomogram is areliable and robust tool for the distinction and prediction of liver metastasisin breast cancer patients, thus helping better choose medical examinations andoptimize therapeutic regimen under the cooperation among medical oncologists and surgeons.DOI: 10.7150/jca.24445 PMCID: PMC6010683PMID: 29937928
