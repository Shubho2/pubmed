Its function in cancer is context-dependent since PROX1 has beenshown to play both oncogenic and tumour suppressive roles. Here, we show thatPROX1 suppresses the transcription of MMP14, a metalloprotease involved inangiogenesis and cancer invasion, by binding and suppressing the activity ofMMP14 promoter. Prox1 deletion in murine dermal lymphatic vessels in vivo and in human LECs increased MMP14 expression. In a hepatocellular carcinoma cell lineexpressing high endogenous levels of PROX1, its silencing increased both MMP14expression and MMP14-dependent invasion in 3D. Moreover, PROX1 ectopic expressionreduced the MMP14-dependent 3D invasiveness of breast cancer cells and angiogenicsprouting of blood endothelial cells in conjunction with MMP14 suppression. Ourstudy uncovers a new transcriptional regulatory mechanism of cancer cell invasionand endothelial cell specification.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27739-w PMCID: PMC6015061PMID: 29934628
