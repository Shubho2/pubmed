In bladder cancer, FSIP1 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis ofbladder urothelial carcinoma. In this study, we investigated whether FSIP1 isessential in the progression of bladder cancer and the mechanism by which itmediates this effect.Methods: FSIP1 expression was knocked down in bladder cancer cells usinglentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA). FSIP1 expression was detectedusing Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and quantitative reversetranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The effects of FSIP1 knockdownon tumor cells were assessed using colony formation,3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and flowcytometry (FCM) apoptosis assays in vitro and BALB/c nude mouse xenograft modelin vivo.Results: The findings suggested that FSIP1 protein was highly expressed inbladder cancer cell lines. Knockdown of FSIP1 resulted in reduced tumor cellviability, cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and apoptosis of bladder cancer cell lines (P<0.05). Moreover, knockdown of FSIP1 expression suppressed the tumorformation and growth of bladder cancer xenografts (P<0.05). At the gene level,knockdown of FSIP1 expression downregulated the activity of the PI3K/AKTsignaling pathway.Conclusion: This study demonstrated that knockdown of FSIP1 suppressed bladdercancer cell malignant behaviors in vitro and in vivo through the inhibition ofthe PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting that targeting FSIP1 could be further evaluated as a potential therapeutic strategy in bladder cancer.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S158275 PMCID: PMC5896667PMID: 29670371
