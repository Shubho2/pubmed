Early (EMR) and late(LMR) morphological response were defined as %ΔDmax13 or %ΔDmax14, respectively. Responders were patients with %ΔDmax >30. Pathological complete response (pCR)patients achieved a residual cancer burden score of 0.STATISTICAL TESTS: T-test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves,multiple regression, logistic regression, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)analysis were used for the analysis.RESULTS: At TP1 there was a significant difference between response groups fortCho1 concerning EMR prediction (P = 0.05) and pCR (P < 0.05) and for Kep 1(P = 0.03) concerning LMR prediction. At TP2, no modification of tCho and otherparameters could predict response. At TP3, ΔtCho, ΔDmax, and ΔVol could predictLMR (P < 0.05 for all parameters), pCR (P < 0.05 for all parameters), and ΔKtranscould predict only pCR (P = 0.04). Logistic regression at baseline showed thehighest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9 for prediction of pCR. The triplenegative (TN) subgroup showed significantly higher tCho at baseline (P = 0.02)and higher ΔtCho levels at TP3 (P < 0.05).DATA CONCLUSION: Baseline measurements of tCho in combination withclinicopathological criteria could predict non-pCR with a high AUC. Furthermore, tCho quantification for prediction of pCR was more sensitive for TN tumors.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 4 J. Magn. Reson.
