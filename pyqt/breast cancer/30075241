In current study, four cyclopeptides along with one phenyl amide wereisolated from the ethyl acetate extract of Bacillus velezensis sp. RA5401. Their structures were determined and characterized as cycle (L-prolyl-L-leucyl)2 (1),cyclo (L-prolyl-l-valine)2 (2), cycle (L-phenylanalyl-L-propyl)2 (3), cyclo(D-pro-L-tyr-L-pro-L-tyr)2 (4) and N-(2-phenylethyl)acetamide (5) on the basis ofelectron spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques and comparison with the literature data. The five compounds havebeen isolated for the first time from this species. The effect of variousconcentrations of these compounds on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells was examined. It was found that 1 and 2 inducedconcentration-independent anti-proliferative effects, while 3, 4 and 5 inhibited cancer cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, todetermine the suitable binding targets of these compounds within cancer cellline, detailed target prediction and comparative molecular-docking studies wereperformed. The compounds 1 and 2 hit intracellular anti-cancer targets ofproteases family, while compounds 3, 4 and 5 interacted with different membranereceptors of G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). In conclusion, the Bacillusvelezensis RA5401 can be an ideal strain to produce anti-proliferativeconstituents at industrial scale.Copyright Â© 2018.
