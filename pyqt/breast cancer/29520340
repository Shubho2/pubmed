It is widely accepted that triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) is one of the most aggressive subtypes, often associated with poor patientoutcome due to the development of metastases in secondary organs, such as thelungs, brain, and bone. The molecular complexity of the metastatic process incombination with the lack of effective targeted therapies for TNBC metastasishave fostered significant research efforts during the past few years to identify molecular "drivers" of this lethal cascade. In this review, the most current and important findings on TNBC metastasis, as well as its closely associatedbasal-like subtype, including metastasis-promoting or suppressor genes andaberrantly regulated signaling pathways at specific stages of the metastaticcascade are being discussed. Finally, the most promising therapeutic approachesand novel strategies emerging from these molecular targets that could potentiallybe clinically applied in the near future are being highlighted.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00031 PMCID: PMC5827095PMID: 29520340
