The purpose of this study is to document our dual-institution upgrade rates of NAPsdiagnosed on core needle biopsy and review the upgrade rates reported in theliterature.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following IRB approval, CNB results from Duke University(7/1/2004-6/30/2014) and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill(1/1/04-6/30/2013) were reviewed to identify non-atypical papillomas. All caseswith surgical excision or 2 years of imaging follow up were included. Inaddition, a literature review identified 60 published studies on upgrades of NAPsdiagnosed at CNB. Cases in our cohort and the published literature were reviewed for confounding factors: [1] missing radiologic-pathologic concordance and/ordiscordance, [2] papillomas included with high-risk lesions, [3] high risklesions counted as upgrades, [4] review by a nonspecialized breast pathologist,and [5] cancer incidentally detected.RESULTS: Of the 388 CNBs in our dual-institution cohort, 136 (35%) patientsunderwent surgical excision and 252 (65%) patients had imaging follow up. Aftercontrolling for confounders, no cancers (0/388) were found at surgical excisionor during follow up imaging. The literature review upstaging rate was 4.0%(166/4157) but 1.8% (4/227) after excluding studies with confounders. Thecombined upstaging rate from the literature and this study was 0.6% (4/615).CONCLUSION: The upstaging rate for CNB diagnosed NAPs was 0% in our cohort and0.6% overall after adjusting for confounders. This low rate does not warrantreflexive surgical excision and diagnostic imaging follow up should bediscretionary.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
