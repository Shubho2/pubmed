In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that TGF-β-induced EMT is NF-κB-dependent in various cancer types. However, it islargely unclear if NF-κB mediates TGF-β-induced EMT in breast cancer, and if thismediation occurs, the regulatory mechanisms are unknown. In our study, we foundthat TGF-β activates the NF-κB pathway. Inhibition of NF-κB signaling markedlyabrogates TGF-β-induced EMT. By studying the regulatory mechanism ofTGF-β-induced NF-κB signaling, we found that lncRNA NKILA was upregulated byTGF-β and was essential for the negative feedback regulation of the NF-κBpathway. Accordingly, overexpression of NKILA significantly reduced TGF-β-inducedtumor metastasis in vivo. Consistent with the results from mice, the expressionof NKILA was negatively correlated with EMT phenotypes in clinical breast cancer samples. Collectively, our study indicated that the NKILA-mediated negativefeedback affects TGF-β-induced NF-κB activation and that NKILA may be atherapeutic molecule in breast cancer metastasis via inhibition of EMT.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31605 PMID: 29761481
