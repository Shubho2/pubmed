Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regressionmodels, and propensity score matching were utilized to comprehensively evaluatethe cohort.Results: Multivariate analysis after propensity score matching showed thatpatients with one to two micrometastases did not substantially benefit fromaxillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer-specific survival (p = 0.725).However, a subgroup analysis indicated that axillary dissection may benefitestrogen receptor-negative patients. Moreover, patients who carried threemicrometastases had a significantly lower crude hazard ratio in breastcancer-specific survival.Conclusion: Axillary lymph node dissection may have advantages in high-riskmicrometastatic patients. Patients with three micrometastases should be treatedwith caution.DOI: 10.4155/fsoa-2018-0008 PMCID: PMC5961405PMID: 29796305
