In a previous transcriptomic screen of male andfemale breast cancer we observed that Stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) was overexpressed inthe former. The aim of this study was to confirm the expression of STC2 in malebreast cancer, and to investigate whether this had an impact on patientprognosis. Following an earlier transcriptomic screen, STC2 gene expression wasconfirmed by RT-qPCR in matched male and female BC samples as well as intumour-associated fibroblasts derived from each gender. Subsequently, STC2protein expression was examined immunohistochemically in tissue microarrayscontaining 477 male breast cancer cases. Cumulative survival probabilities werecalculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate survival analysis wasperformed using the Cox hazard model. Gender-specific STC2 gene expression showeda 5.6-fold upregulation of STC2 transcripts in male breast cancer, also supportedby data deposited in OncomineTM . STC2 protein expression was a positiveprognostic factor for disease-free survival (Log rank; total p=0.035, HR=0.49;tumour cells p=0.017, HR=0.44; stroma p=0.030, HR=0.48), but had no significantimpact on overall survival (Log rank; total p=0.23, HR=0.71; tumour cellsp=0.069, HR=0.59; stroma p=0.650, HR=0.87). Importantly, multivariate analysisadjusted for patient age at diagnosis, node staging, tumour size, ER and PRstatus revealed that total STC2 expression as well as expression in tumour cells was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (Cox regression;p=0.018, HR=0.983; p=0.015, HR=0.984 respectively). In conclusion STC2 expressionis abundant in male breast cancer where it is an independent prognostic factorfor disease-free survival. This article is protected by copyright.
