However, the role and mechanisms of ER-α36 in cisplatin resistance of breast cancer cells remain unclear. This study investigates the expression and role of ER-α36 in cisplatin resistance of breast cancer cells and elucidates its underlying mechanisms.METHODS: The expression of ER-α36 and the proteins involved in nongenomicestrogen signaling was evaluated by western blot analysis. Cisplatin sensitivity was explored by CCK-8 assay, monolayer colony formation assay and apoptosisassays, respectively. ER-α36 siRNAs/shRNAs and overexpression vector weretransfected into cells to down-regulate or up-regulate ER-α36 expression.Loss-and gain-of function assays were performed to investigate the role of ER-α36in cisplatin sensitivity. The interaction between ER-α36 and EGFR/HER-2 weredetected using CoIP. A mouse xenograft model of breast cancer was established to verify the role of ER-α36 in vivo.RESULTS: ER-α36 is expressed at higher levels in cisplatin-resistant breastcancer cells compared to cisplatin sensitive cells. Cisplatin inducedup-regulation of ER-α36 in a dose-dependent manner in breast cancer cells.Overexpression of ER-α36 leaded to cell resistant to cisplatin and knockdown ofER-α36 in cisplatin-resistant breast cancer cells restored cisplatin sensitivity.The up-regulation of ER-α36 resulted in increased activation of nongenomicestrogen signaling, which was responsible for cisplatin resistance. Disruption ofER-α36-mediated nongenomic estrogen signaling with kinase inhibitorssignificantly inhibited cisplatin-induced expression of ER-α36 and increasedcisplatin sensitivity. The in vivo experiment also confirmed that up-regulationof ER-α36 attenuated cisplatin sensitivity in a mouse xenograft model of breastcancer.CONCLUSIONS: The results for the first time demonstrated that ER-α36 mediatescisplatin resistance in breast cancer cells through nongenomic estrogensignaling, suggesting that ER-α36 may serve as a novel target for cisplatinresistance and a potential indicator of cisplatin sensitivity in breast cancertreatment.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0798-z PMCID: PMC6019204PMID: 29940998
