Electronic address:prakash.pillai-zoo@msubaroda.ac.in.MethylCpG binding protein-2 (MeCP2) is an epigenetic regulator and essential for brain development. MeCP2 mutations are associated with a spectrum ofneuro-developmental disorders that vary depending on the patient gender, mostnotably Rett Syndrome. MeCP2 is essential for normal neuronal maturation, andglial cell function in the brain. Besides, its role in neurodevelopmentaldisorders, MeCP2 is involved in many cancers such as breast, colorectal, lung,liver, and prostate cancer. Glioma is the most lethal form of brain cancer.Studies have shown that dysfunctional epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in glioma progression. Further, previous studies have suggested a role for MeCP2 in glioma pathogenesis. In this study, we show that MeCP2 may play a criticalrole in the suppression of glioma progression. Stable overexpression of MeCP2inC6 glioma cells inhibits proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion.Moreover, MeCP2 overexpression inhibits pERKand BDNF expression while inducingGFAP expression in C6 glioma. These findings suggest that MeCP2 may play acrucial role in suppression of glioma progression.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.neulet.2018.03.020 PMID: 29540297
