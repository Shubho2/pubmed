Thus, theunderstanding of the mechanisms responsible for the expression of PD‑L1 in tumor cells may help to improve the response to PD‑L1 blockade therapies. In thisstudy, we investigated whether resveratrol, a grape-derived stilbenoid withimmunoregulatory activity, modulates the expression of PD‑L1 in breast andcolorectal cancer cells. The surface expression of PD‑L1 was determined by flowcytometry in cancer cells treated with resveratrol and/or piceatannol. Eachstilbenoid alone induced PD‑L1 and when used in combination, elicited asynergistic upregulation of PD‑L1 in some cell lines. The induction of PD‑L1 bythe combined use of stilbenoids was most pronounced in the Cal51 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and SW620 colon cancer cells. The observed induction ofPD‑L1 was transcriptionally mediated by nuclear factor (NF)-κB, as shown by NF‑κBreporter assays, the nuclear accumulation of the p65 subunit of NF‑κB, inhibitionby the IKK inhibitor, BMS‑345541, and histone the modification inhibitors,resminostat, entinostat or anacardic acid. Combined treatment with resveratroland piceatannol also decreased tumor cell survival as indicated by theupregulation of the DNA damaging marker, γH2AX, the cleavage of caspase 3, thedownregulation of the survival markers, p38-MAPK/c‑Myc, and G1-to-S cell cyclearrest.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4512 PMID: 30066852
