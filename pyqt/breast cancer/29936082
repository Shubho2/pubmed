Anultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for quantitation of tumor suppressor protein Carcinoma Antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) based on ternary signal amplificationstrategy was fabricated. In this work, the antibody (horseradish peroxidase(HRP)-Labeled anti CA 15-3) was immobilized onto a green and biocompatiblenanocomposite containing gold nano-shrub (Au NSs) electrochemically assembledonto thiolated graphene quantum dots (GQDs/CysA (Cysteamine)). Therefore, a novelmultilayer film based on GQDs, CysA, and Au NSs was exploited to develop a highlysensitive immunosensor for detection of CA 15.3. Fully electrochemicalmethodology was used to prepare a new transducer on a gold surface which provideda high surface area to immobilize a high amount of the anti-CA 15.3. Underoptimized condition the calibration curve for CA 15.3 concentration was linear inthe range of 0.3-1 U/mL and 2-250 U/mL with detection limit of 0.011 U/mL. Themethod was applied to the assay of CA 15.3 in malignant cell line lysates ofhuman breast adenocarcinoma cell line-MCF-7.Copyright © 2018.
