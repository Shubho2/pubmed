In a first-in-human phase 1 study,AZD9496 exhibited dose nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the mechanistic basis of whichwas investigated in this study. The metabolism kinetics of AZD9496 were studiedusing human liver microsomes (HLMs), recombinant cytochrome P450s (rP450s), andhepatocytes. In addition, modeling approaches were used to gain furthermechanistic insights. CYP2C8 was predominantly responsible for biotransformation of AZD9496 to its two main metabolites whose rate of formation with increasingAZD9496 concentrations exhibited complete substrate inhibition in HLM, rCYP2C8,and hepatocytes. Total inhibition by AZD9496 of amodiaquine N-deethylation, aspecific probe of CYP2C8 activity, confirmed the completeness of this inhibition.The commonly used substrate inhibition model analogous to uncompetitiveinhibition fit poorly to the data. However, using the same model but withoutconstraints on the number of molecules occupying the inhibitory binding site(i.e., nS1ES) provided a significantly better fit (F test, P< 0.005). With theimproved model, up to three AZD9496 molecules were predicted to bind theinhibitory site of CYP2C8. In contrast to previous studies showing substrateinhibition of P450s to be partial, our results demonstrate complete substrateinhibition of CYP2C8 via binding of more than one molecule of AZD9496 to theinhibitory site. As CYP2C8 appears to be the sole isoform catalyzing formation ofthe main metabolites, the substrate inhibition might explain the observed dosenonlinearity in the clinic at higher doses.Copyright Â© 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/dmd.118.081539 PMID: 29921707
