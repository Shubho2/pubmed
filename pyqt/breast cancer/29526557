The purpose of this study isto explore specific characteristics of patients with IPC, investigate itsclinicopathological features, prognosis in China and confirm its surgerymanagement.METHODS: We identified 111 patients with IPC from the registry of Tianjin MedicalUniversity Cancer Institute and Hospital between 2004 and 2017. Follow-up ofcases dating back to January 1, 2004 was obtained from retrospective chart reviewand patient questionnaires. Differences in clinical features and survival ofpatients were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: The median tumor size was 2.25 cm. Median age was 62 years. In the casesof axillary lymph node dissection(ALND), only 1.1% (1/85) of patients withaxillary lymph node metastasis were found. The diagnostic accuracy ofpreoperative Color Doppler ultrasound and Mammograms for IPC was 62.0% (62/100)and 63.5% (54/85) respectively. The median follow-up period was 52 (range2-149)months. The overall survival rate was 98.9%, 92.2%,and 85.6% at 2,5,and 10 years and the relapse-free rate was 99.1%,97.2%,and 92.0% at 2,5, and 10 years,respectively. The disease-specific survival rate was 100%.CONCLUSION: Overall, we report some unique features of IPC in the Chinesepopulation. The patients of IPC of the breast in China have more excellentprognosis than in Caucasian and other races. The diagnostic accuracy of imagingwas low, and was easily misinterpreted as a cyst or benign disease. Preoperative core needle biopsies are very difficult for accurate pathological diagnosis ofIPC. IPC is a localized disease with a low frequency of axillary lymph nodeinvolvement, rare distant metastases and excellent survival. The low incidence ofaxillary lymph node metastasis suggests that quadrectomy + sentinel lymph nodebiopsy (SLNB) and breast-conserving surgery is recommended for IPC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
