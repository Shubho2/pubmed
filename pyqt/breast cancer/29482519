We previously reported that cell-celladhesion proteins, such as E-cadherin, and desmosomal proteins are involved incell aggregation to form clusters independently of cell migration or matrixadhesion. Here, we investigated the involvement of gap junction intercellularcommunication (GJIC) during anchorage-independent clustering of MCF7 breastadenocarcinoma cells.METHODS: We used live cell image acquisition and analysis to monitor the kineticsof MCF7 cell clustering in the presence/absence of GJIC pharmacologicalinhibitors and to screen a LOPAC® bioactive compound library. We also used acalcein transfer assay and flow cytometry to evaluate GJIC involvement in cancer cell clustering.RESULTS: We first demonstrated that functional GJIC are established in the early phase of cancer cell aggregation. We then showed that pharmacological inhibition of GJIC using tonabersat and meclofenamate delayed MCF7 cell clustering andreduced calcein transfer. We also found that brefeldin A, an inhibitor ofvesicular trafficking, which we identified by screening a small compound library,and latrunculin A, an actin cytoskeleton-disrupting agent, both impaired MCF7cell clustering and calcein transfer.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that GJIC are involved from the earlieststages of anchorage-independent cancer cell aggregation. They also give insights into the regulatory mechanisms that could modulate the formation of clusters ofcirculating tumor cells.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4148-5 PMCID: PMC5828067PMID: 29482519
