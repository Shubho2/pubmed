The present study was to find out whether punarnavine, the quinolizidine alkaloid, with alreadyproven antimetastatic effect on spontaneous B16F10 pulmonary metastasis has gotany effect on a drastic organ-specific breast cancer spread. For the study, weselected a syngenic mouse 4T1 breast tumour model that mimics stage four of humanbreast cancer. The metastatic progression of 4T1 to lymph nodes, lungs, and liverwas reduced by punarnavine (40 mg/kg body weight) administration in BALB/c mice. This was evident from the histopathology of these organs as well as from thereduction in the metastatic cell density of cultured 6-thioguanine-resistant 4T1 cells in the punarnavine-treated group compared to the control group. There wasalso a significant (p < 0.0001) inhibition of the primary breast tumour growth inthe orthotopic site of induction with a simultaneous increase (p < 0.0001) in thelife span of treated animals. The assessment of biochemical parameters such ashydroxyproline, hexosamine, uronic acid, sialic acid and γ-glutamyl transferaseand the analysis of various cytokines VEGF, IL-1β, TNF-α and GM-CSF showed asimilar pattern of reduction in punarnavine (p < 0.0001) treated group comparedto the control group. The gene expression study revealed the inhibitory effect ofpunarnavine on the major genes MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and VEGF involved in the metastatic process. These findings undeniably proved the potential of thisquinolizidine alkaloid in combating breast tumour development and its progressionin the studied murine model.DOI: 10.1007/s10787-018-0490-0 PMID: 29770894
