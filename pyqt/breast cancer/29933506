In this study, we applied postmarketing real-world data on amechanistic model analysis for neutropenic profiles of eribulin in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Demographic and safety data were collectedusing an active surveillance method from eribulin-treated recurrent or metastaticbreast cancer patients. Changes in neutrophil counts over time were analyzedusing a mechanistic pharmacodynamic model. Pathophysiological factors that might affect the severity of neutropenia were investigated, and neutropenic patternswere simulated for different treatment schedules. Clinical and laboratory datawere collected from 401 patients (5199 neutrophil count measurements) who had notreceived granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and were eligible forpharmacodynamic analysis. The estimated mean parameters were as follows: meantransit time = 104.5 h, neutrophil proliferation rate constant = 0.0377 h-1 ,neutrophil elimination rate constant = 0.0295 h-1 , and linear coefficient ofdrug effect = 0.0413 mL/ng. Low serum albumin levels and low baseline neutrophil counts were associated with severe neutropenia. The probability of grade ≥3neutropenia was predicted to be 69%, 27%, and 27% for patients on standard,biweekly, and triweekly treatment scenarios, respectively, based on virtualsimulations using the developed pharmacodynamic model. In conclusion, this is thefirst application of postmarketing surveillance data to a model-based safetyanalysis. This analysis of safety data reflecting authentic clinical settingswill provide useful information on the safe use and potential risk factors oferibulin.© 2018 The Authors.
