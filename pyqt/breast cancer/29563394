Many malignanttumors show a washout pattern in time-intensity curves. Therefore, we designed a program that automatically detects the position with the strongest washout effectusing the technique, such as the subtraction technique, which extracts only thewashout area in the tumor, and by scanning data in 2×2 pixel region of interest(ROI). Operation of this independently developed program was verified using aphantom system that simulated tumors. In three cases of malignant tumors, thewashout pattern detection rate in images with manually set ROI was ≤6%, whereasthe detection rate with our novel method was 100%. In one case of a benign tumor,when the same method was used, we checked that there was no washout effect anddetected the persistent pattern. Thus, the distinction between benign andmalignant tumors using our method was completely consistent with the pathologicaldiagnoses made. Our novel method is therefore effective for differentiatingbetween benign and malignant mammary tumors in dynamic magnetic resonance images.DOI: 10.6009/jjrt.2018_JSRT_74.3.251 PMID: 29563394
