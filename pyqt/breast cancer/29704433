Consequently, clinical concerns have shifted from solelyfocusing on survival to quality of life, with fertility preservation as animportant consideration. Among fertility preservation strategies for femalepatients, ovarian tissue cryopreservation and subsequent reimplantation has been the only clinical option available to cancer survivors with cryopreserved tissue.However, follicle atresia after transplantation and risk of reintroducingmalignant cells have prevented this procedure from becoming widely adopted inclinics. Herein, we investigated the encapsulation of ovarian follicles inalginate hydrogels that isolate the graft from the host, yet allows formaturation after transplantation at a heterotopic (i.e., subcutaneous) site, aprocess we termed in vivo follicle maturation. Survival of multiple folliclepopulations was confirmed via histology, with the notable development of theantral follicles. Collected oocytes (63%) exhibited polar body extrusion and werefertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection and standard in vitrofertilization procedures. Successfully fertilized oocytes developed to thepronucleus (14%), two-cell (36%), and four-cell (7%) stages. Furthermore, ovarianfollicles cotransplanted with metastatic breast cancer cells within the hydrogelsallowed for retrieval of the follicles, and no mice developed tumors afterremoval of the implant, confirming that the hydrogel prevented seeding of diseasewithin the host. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a viable option forsafe use of potentially cancer-laden ovarian donor tissue for in vivo folliclematuration within a retrievable hydrogel and subsequent oocyte collection.Ultimately, this technology may provide novel options to preserve fertility foryoung female patients with cancer.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/bit.26721 PMCID: PMC6045426 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29704433
