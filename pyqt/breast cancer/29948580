[Epub ahead of print]Synthesis, docking and anticancer activity of azo-linked hybrids of1,3,4-thia-/oxadiazoles with cyclic imides.Bhatt P(1), Kumar M(2), Jha A(3).Author information: (1)Department of Chemistry, GIS, GITAM University, Rushikonda, Visakhapatnam,530045, India.(2)Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee,247667, India.(3)Department of Chemistry, GIS, GITAM University, Rushikonda, Visakhapatnam,530045, India. anjalimanishjha@yahoo.com.A series of novel analogues based on a diazole-imide pharmacophore weresynthesized by diazotizing substituted 1,3,4-thia-/oxadiazol-2-amines andsubsequently coupling the resulting diazonium salts with N-substituted cyclicimides. The resulting compounds C1 to C28 were characterized by various spectral methods, viz. IR, NMR and mass spectroscopy. All the synthesized compounds weretested against two human cancer cell lines: human breast adenocarcinoma cell lineMCF-7 and colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29. Among the synthesizedcompounds, C14(2-(4-chloro-3-((5-(4-nitrophenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)diazenyl)phenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione) emerged as a potential candidate against both MCF-7 and HT-29 with [Formula: see text] values of 0.09 ± 0.02 [Formula: seetext]M and 0.11 ± 0.03 [Formula: see text]M, respectively. Similarly, compoundC16 displayed highest anticancer activity against MCF-7 cell line with [Formula: see text] = 0.07 ± 0.02 [Formula: see text]M. Target fishing (inverse docking)using ChemMapper server identified EGFR tyrosine and CDK2 kinases as highpriority targets for this pharmacophore. Computational docking (AutoDock 4.2) wasused to analyse the interactions between the target proteins and activecompounds.DOI: 10.1007/s11030-018-9832-5 PMID: 29948580
