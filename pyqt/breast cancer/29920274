EMT is thought to be regulated primarily at thetranscriptional level through the repressive activity of EMT transcriptionfactors. However, these classical mechanisms have been parsed out almostexclusively in vitro, leaving questions about the programs driving EMT inphysiological contexts. Here, using a lineage-labeled mouse model of pancreaticductal adenocarcinoma to study EMT in vivo, we found that most tumors lose their epithelial phenotype through an alternative program involving proteininternalization rather than transcriptional repression, resulting in a "partialEMT" phenotype. Carcinoma cells utilizing this program migrate as clusters,contrasting with the single-cell migration pattern associated with traditionally defined EMT mechanisms. Moreover, many breast and colorectal cancer cell linesutilize this alternative program to undergo EMT. Collectively, these resultssuggest that carcinoma cells have different ways of losing their epithelialprogram, resulting in distinct modes of invasion and dissemination.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
