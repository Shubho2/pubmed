Until now,the presence of circulating ESR1 mutations at the end of adjuvant treatment by AIin early breast cancer had never been clearly established. In this context, theaim of the present study was to evaluate the circulating ESR1 mutation frequency at the end of adjuvant treatment and after relapse.METHODS: This monocentric retrospective study was based on available storedplasmas and included all early breast cancer patients who completed at least2 years of AI adjuvant treatment and experienced a documented relapse after theend of their treatment. Circulating ESR1 mutations (D538G, Y537S/N/C) wereassessed by droplet digital PCR in plasma samples taken at the end of adjuvanttreatment, at time of relapse and at time of progression under first linemetastatic treatment.RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included, with a median adjuvant AI exposureof 60 months (range 41-85). No circulating ESR1 mutation was detectable at theend of AI adjuvant therapy. At first relapse, 5.3% of the patients (2/38) had adetectable circulating ESR1 mutation. At time of progression on first-linemetastatic treatment, 33% of the patients (7/21) under AI had a detectablecirculating ESR1 mutation compared to none of the patients under chemotherapy(0/10). The two patients with a detectable ESR1 mutation at relapse were treated by AI and had an increase of their variant allele fraction at time of progressionon first-line metastatic treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Circulating ESR1 mutation detection at the end of AI-based adjuvant treatment is not clinically useful. Circulating ESR1 mutation could be assessedas soon as first relapse to guide interventional studies.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0968-0 PMCID: PMC5956618PMID: 29769099
