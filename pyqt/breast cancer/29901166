Ourprevious studies in breast and colorectal cancer indicate an association between RHBDD2 overexpression and advanced tumor stages. Two alternative transcriptional variants have been described for RHBDD2, which would be encoding for differentRHBDD2 protein isoforms. The expression of these RHBDD2 variants/isoforms and itsassociation with breast cancer was the focus of this study. First, expression of RHBDD2 splicing variants was evaluated in normal and breast tumor samples. RHBDD2variant 2 overexpression was detected in tumors in respect to normal breasttissues at the mRNA and protein levels (P<0.05). Moreover, RHBDD2 variant 2expression was associated with poor prognostic factors such as basal‑likeintrinsic subtype (P<0.05), high proliferation (P<0.01) and long‑termrisk‑of‑recurrence (P<0.01) scores. Second, the expression of both variants wasevaluated under nutritional‑deprived conditions in breast cancer cell lines.Results demonstrated that RHBDD2 splicing was switched from mRNA variant 1 tovariant 2 in association with a significant increment of protein isoform B inresponse to glucose starvation treatment. Therefore, we propose that the switchfrom the RHBDD2 variant 1, expressed in normal epithelial cells, to variant 2occurs as an adaptive phenotype to bypass the stressful tumor microenvironmentand promote tumor progression. Finally, the RHBDD2 subcellular localization wascorroborated at the Golgi apparatus and their associated v‑SNARE transportvesicles, suggesting a putative new role for RHBDD2 in the protein trafficking ofhuman breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6489 PMID: 29901166
