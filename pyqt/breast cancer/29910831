In selected patients, efficacy results tend to be similar to those observed after radical modified mastectomyand at the same time, subcutaneous mastectomies preserve the patient's bodyimage. Yet the oncologic safety of the two former surgical approaches is still a matter of debate, also in consideration of the almost complete absence ofclinical studies directed to prospective, controlled comparisons betweensubcutaneous and radical modified mastectomies. In addition, no clearstatement-and consequently no consensus-emerges from the rather rare reportsaddressing the issue of whether or not there exist robust algorithms for guiding decision-making in delivering postoperative radiotherapy after NSM or SSM. Theobjective of the present review article is to revisit the dataset recentlyprovided by the literature, which might help oncology teams optimise localtreatment in this patient population.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.834 PMCID: PMC5985754PMID: 29910831
