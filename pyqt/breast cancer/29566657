We wanted to evaluate mutationpatterns in 20 breast cancer susceptibility genes and correlate the mutationswith clinical characteristics to determine the effects of these germlinemutations on breast cancer prognosis.METHODS: The study cohort included 480 ethnic Chinese individuals in Taiwan with at least one of the six clinical risk factors for hereditary breast cancer:family history of breast or ovarian cancer, young age of onset for breast cancer,bilateral breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, both breast and ovariancancer, and male breast cancer. PCR-enriched amplicon-sequencing on a nextgeneration sequencing platform was used to determine the germline DNA sequencesof all exons and exon-flanking regions of the 20 genes. Protein-truncatingvariants were identified as pathogenic.RESULTS: We detected a 13.5% carrier rate of pathogenic germline mutations, with BRCA2 being the most prevalent and the non-BRCA genes accounting for 38.5% of themutation carriers. BRCA mutation carriers were more likely to be diagnosed ofbreast cancer with lymph node involvement (66.7% vs 42.6%; P = 0.011), and hadsignificantly worse breast cancer specific outcomes. The 5-year disease-freesurvival was 73.3% for BRCA mutation carriers and 91.1% for non-carriers (hazard ratio for recurrence or death 2.42, 95% CI 1.29-4.53; P = 0.013). After adjustingfor clinical prognostic factors, BRCA mutation remained an independent poorprognostic factor for cancer recurrence or death (adjusted hazard ratio 3.04, 95%CI 1.40-6.58; P = 0.005). Non-BRCA gene mutation carriers did not exhibit anysignificant difference in cancer characteristics or outcomes compared to thosewithout detected mutations. Among the risk factors for hereditary breast cancer, the odds of detecting a germline mutation increased significantly with havingbilateral breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio 3.27, 95% CI 1.64-6.51; P = 0.0008) or having more than one risk factor (odds ratio 2.07, 95% CI 1.22-3.51;P = 0.007).CONCLUSIONS: Without prior knowledge of the mutation status, BRCA mutationcarriers had more advanced breast cancer on initial diagnosis and worsecancer-related outcomes. Optimal approach to breast cancer treatment for BRCAmutation carriers warrants further investigation.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4229-5 PMCID: PMC5863855PMID: 29566657
