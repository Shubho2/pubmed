The aim of this study was to assess theimpact of a radiologist-led workshop on inter-observer variability in volumedelineation on MRI.METHODS: Data from three separate studies evaluating the impact of MRI in lung,breast and cervix were collated. At pre-workshop evaluation, observers involvedin each clinical site were instructed to delineate specified volumes.Radiologists specialising in each cancer site conducted an interactive workshopon interpretation of images and anatomy for each clinical site. At post-workshop evaluation, observers repeated delineation a minimum of 2 weeks after theworkshops. Inter-observer variability was evaluated using dice similaritycoefficient (DSC) and volume similarity (VOLSIM) index comparing reference andobserver volumes.RESULTS: Post-workshop primary gross tumour volumes (GTV) were smaller thanpre-workshop volumes for lung with a mean percentage reduction of 10.4%. Breastclinical target volumes (CTV) were similar but seroma volumes were smallerpost-workshop on both supine (65% reduction) and prone MRI (73% reduction). Basedon DSC scores, improvement in inter-observer variability was seen for the seroma cavity volume on prone MRI with a reduction in DSC score range from 0.4-0.8 to0.7-0.9. Breast CTV demonstrated good inter-observer variability scores (mean DSC0.9) for both pre- and post-workshop. Post-workshop observer delineated cervixGTV was smaller than pre-workshop by 26.9%.CONCLUSION: A radiologist-led workshop did not significantly reduceinter-observer variability in volume delineation for the three clinical sites.However, some improvement was noted in delineation of breast CTV, seroma volumes and cervix GTV.Â© 2018 The Authors.
