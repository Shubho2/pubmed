We compared vinflunine withphysician's choice of alkylating agent (AA) for patients with heavily pretreated MBC.Patients and methods: In this open-label phase III trial, patients with MBC were included if they had received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens for MBCand had received anthracycline, taxane, antimetabolite and vinca alkaloidtherapy. Patients were no longer candidates for these chemotherapies because ofresistance and/or intolerance. Patients were randomised to either vinflunine280 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks (q3w) or AA monotherapy q3w. Stratificationfactors were performance status, number of prior chemotherapy lines for MBC,disease measurability and study site. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).Results: A total of 594 patients were randomised (298 to vinflunine, 296 to AA). There was no difference between treatment arms in OS (hazard ratio 1.04,P = 0.67; median 9.1 months for vinflunine versus 9.3 months for AA),progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.94, P = 0.49; median 2.5 versus1.9 months, respectively) or overall response rate (6% versus 4%, respectively). However, the disease control rate was significantly higher with vinflunine thanAA (44% versus 35%, respectively; P = 0.04). The most common adverse events (any grade) were haematological and gastrointestinal disorders and asthenia in botharms. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (19% versus 11%with vinflunine versus AA, respectively) and asthenia (10% versus 4%).Conclusions: Vinflunine 280 mg/m2 q3w did not improve OS compared with thephysician's choice of AA as third- or later-line therapy for MBC. Vinfluninedemonstrated an acceptable safety profile, suggesting that vinflunine 320 mg/m2merits evaluation.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01091168.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy051 PMID: 29481630
