Zhihui.Wang@uth.tmc.edu.Nanoparticles have shown great promise in improving cancer treatment efficacywhile reducing toxicity and treatment side effects. Predicting the treatmentoutcome for nanoparticle systems by measuring nanoparticle biodistribution hasbeen challenging due to the commonly unmatched, heterogeneous distribution ofnanoparticles relative to free drug distribution. We here present aproof-of-concept study that uses mathematical modeling together withexperimentation to address this challenge. Individual mice with 4T1 breast cancerwere treated with either nanoparticle-delivered or free doxorubicin, with resultsdemonstrating improved cancer kill efficacy of doxorubicin loaded nanoparticlesin comparison to free doxorubicin. We then developed a mathematical theory torender model predictions from measured nanoparticle biodistribution, asdetermined using graphite furnace atomic absorption. Model analysis finds thattreatment efficacy increased exponentially with increased nanoparticleaccumulation within the tumor, emphasizing the significance of developing newways to optimize the delivery efficiency of nanoparticles to the tumormicroenvironment.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25878-8 PMCID: PMC5967303PMID: 29795392
