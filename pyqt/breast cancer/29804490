A causal association is reported between prolonged exposures to elevatedlevels of estrogen and breast cancer. Therefore inhibiting aromatase (CYP19A),which catalyses the conversion of androgens to estrogens, is an importantapproach in prevention and treatment of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breastcancer. 2. Melatonin, a natural indolic hormone, is reported to prevent freeradical induced carcinogenesis and block local estrogen synthesis in breasttissue via aromatase inhibition. However several features of melatonin limit its therapeutic use. 3. In the present study aromatase inhibiting potential of2-methyl indole hydrazones are investigated, and compared with melatonin, by two in vitro models; a cell-free assay using a fluorescence substrate and acell-based assay where cell proliferation was determined in ER+ human breastcancer cells (MCF-7 BUS) in the absence of estrogen and the presence oftestosterone. Aromatase inhibitory effect is also explored by molecular modellingstudies. 4. In biological activity assays monochloro substituted indolehydrazones were found to have stronger aromatase inhibitory activity among alltested derivatives and were more active than melatonin. This finding is furtherconfirmed by molecular modelling. 5. These results may be useful in the designand synthesis of novel melatonin analogues with higher inhibitory potency againstaromatase.DOI: 10.1080/00498254.2018.1482029 PMID: 29804490
