[Epub ahead of print]Novel Hybrid Conjugates with Dual Suppression of Estrogenic and InflammatoryActivities Display Significantly Improved Potency against Breast Cancer.Ning W, Hu Z, Tang C, Yang L, Zhang S, Dong C, Huang J, Zhou HB.In this work, we developed a small library of novel OBHS-RES hybrid compoundswith dual inhibition activities targeting both the estrogen receptor α (ERα) and NF-κB by incorporating resveratrol (RES), a known inhibitor of NF-κB, into aprivileged indirect antagonism structural motif (OBHS, oxabicycloheptenesulfonate) of estrogen receptor (ER). The OBHS-RES conjugates could bind well to ER and showed remarkable ERα antagonistic activity, and they also exhibitedexcellent NO inhibition in macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Compared with4-hydroxytamoxifen, some of them showed better anti-proliferative efficacy inMCF-7 cell lines with IC50 up to 3.7 µM. In vivo experiments in a MCF-7 breastcancer model in Balb/c nude mice indicated that compound 26a was more potent thantamoxifen. Exploration of the compliancy of the structure against ER specificity utilizing these types of isomeric three-dimensional ligands indicated that oneenantiomer had much better biological activity than the other.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00224 PMID: 30053783
