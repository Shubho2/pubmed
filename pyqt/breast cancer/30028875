Previously we have demonstrated thatmiRNA-10b acts as a master regulator of the viability of metastatic tumor cellsand represents a target for therapeutic intervention. We designed and synthesizedan inhibitor of miR-10b, termed MN-anti-miR10b. We showed that treatment withMN-anti-miR10b led to durable regression/elimination of established metastases inmurine models of metastatic breast cancer. Since miRNA-10b has been associatedwith various metastatic and non-metastatic cancers, in the present study, weinvestigated the effect of MN-anti-miR10b in a panel of over 600 cell linesderived from a variety of human malignancies. We observed an effect on theviability of multiple cell lines within each cancer type and a mostly dichotomousresponse with cell lines either strongly responsive to MN-anti-miR10b or not atall even at maximum dose tested, suggesting a very high specificity of theeffect. Genomic modeling of the drug response showed enrichment of genesassociated with the proto-oncogene, c-Jun.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201046 PMCID: PMC6054402PMID: 30028875
