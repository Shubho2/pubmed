This report describes a 67-year-old womanwith metastatic ACC to the breast, only the third reported case of its kind. The salivary gland ACC was first diagnosed 5 years prior. Routine mammogramidentified a Breast Imaging and Reporting Systems (BIRADS) 4 lesion. Core breast biopsy demonstrated findings consistent with metastatic ACC to the breast. Thepatient ultimately underwent local excision but suffered a recurrence of disease less than 2 months later despite chemotherapy. She passed away 15 months afterexcision due to complications associated with a small bowel obstruction anddecompensated respiratory status from pulmonary metastases. While metastaticsalivary ACC to the breast is rare, it is important to be able to distinguishmetastatic salivary ACC to the breast from primary ACC of the breast as thetreatment considerations for the two disease processes differ significantly.© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2018.
