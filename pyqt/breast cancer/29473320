However, its regulatory mechanism in breast cancer remains undefined. Here, we report that RNF144A promotercontains a putative CpG island and the methylation levels of RNF144A promoter arehigher in primary breast tumors than those in normal breast tissues.Consistently, RNF144A promoter methylation levels are associated with itstranscriptional silencing in breast cancer cells, and treatment with DNAmethylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (AZA) reactivates RNF144A expression in cells with RNF144A promoter hypermethylation. Furthermore, genetic knockdownor pharmacological inhibition of endogenous methyl-CpG-binding domain 4 (MBD4)results in increased RNF144A expression. These findings suggest that RNF144A isepigenetically silenced in breast cancer cells by promoter hypermethylation andMBD4.Â© 2018 The Authors.
