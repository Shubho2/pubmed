Numerous factors involved in multiple mechanisms promote the development of tumor chemo/radio-resistance. Cytokines/chemokines areimportant inflammatory factors and highly related to tumorigenesis, metastasisand tumors responses to treatment. A large number of studies have demonstratedthat the network of cytokines activates multiple cell signaling pathways topromote tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and migration. Particularlyin BCa, cytokines-enhanced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processplays a pivotal role in the progression of metastatic phenotypes and resistanceto the traditional chemo/radio-therapy. Virtually, therapeutic resistance is not entirely determined by tumor cell intrinsic characteristics but also dependentupon synchronized effects by numerous of local microenvironmental factors.Emerging evidence highlighted that exosomes secreted from various types of cells promote intercellular communication by transferring bioactive molecules includingmiRNAs and cytokines, suggesting that exosomes are essential for sustentation of tumor progression and therapeutic resistance within the tumor microenvironment.In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which cytokines promote therapeutic resistance of BCa and suggest a potential approach for improving BCa therapeuticsby inhibition of exosome function.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
