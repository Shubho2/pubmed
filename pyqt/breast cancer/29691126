Electronic address: k.n.gaarenstroom@lumc.nl.The optimal management of breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA)1/2 carrierswith isolated serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) found atrisk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is unclear. The prevalence of occultcarcinoma and STIC in a consecutive series of BRCA1/2 carriers undergoing RRSO isreported. The outcome of staging procedures in BRCA1/2 carriers with isolatedSTIC at RRSO as well as the relationship between staging, chemotherapy treatment and risk of recurrence was assessed via a systematic review of the literature.Our series included 235 BRCA1/2 carriers who underwent RRSO. Federation ofGynaecology and Obstetrics stage IA carcinoma or STIC was found at RRSO in three (1.3%) and two (0.9%) patients, respectively. A systematic review of theliterature included 82 BRCA1/2 carriers with isolated STIC found at RRSO. In13/82 (16%) cases with STIC, staging was reported. In none of these cases stagingrevealed more advanced disease. Recurrent disease was found in four of 36patients with reported follow-up. The estimated risk of recurrence in patientswith isolated STIC at RRSO was about 11% (95% confidence interval 3-26%) after a median follow-up of 42 months (range 7-138). No recurrences were reported inthose patients with STIC at RRSO who underwent staging or received chemotherapy. We found 1.3% occult carcinoma and 0.9% STIC at RRSO in our cohort of BRCA1/2carriers. A systematic review of the literature suggests that additionaltreatment after RRSO, i.e. staging and/or chemotherapy, is associated with alower risk of recurrence. However, data on staging and follow-up are limited.Copyright Â© 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clon.2018.03.036 PMID: 29691126
