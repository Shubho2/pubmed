Pascale", Naples, Italy.(2)Parthenope University of Naples, Naples, Italy.KiSS-1 was first described as a metastasis suppressor gene in malignant melanoma.KiSS-1 encodes a 145 amino-acid residue peptide that is further processed,producing the 54 amino acid metastin and shorter peptides collectively namedkisspeptins (KPs). KPs bind and activate KiSS-1R (GPR54). Although the KPs systemhas been extensively studied for its role in endocrinology of reproductive axisin mammals, its role in cancer is still controversial. Experimental evidencesshow that KP system exerts an anti-metastatic effect by the regulation ofcellular migration and invasion in several cancer types. However, the role ofKPs/KiSS-1R is very complex. Genomic studies suggest that KiSS-1/KiSS-1Rexpression might be different in the various stages of tumor development.Furthermore, overexpression of KiSS-1R has been reported to elicit drugresistance in triple negative breast cancer. In this review, we focused onmultiple functions exerted by the KPs/KiSS-1R system in regulating tumorprogression.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00192 PMCID: PMC5936968PMID: 29760678
