The goal ofthis investigation is to quantify racial disparities in the context of breastcancer care, examining the outcomes of recurrence and mortality in the city ofMemphis. Patients with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of breast cancer from January 1,2002, through December 31, 2012, were obtained from the tumor registry. Blackpatients were more likely to have advanced (II, III, or IV) clinical stage ofbreast cancer at diagnosis versus white patients. Black breast cancer patientshad a two times higher odds of recurrence (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 3.0)after adjusting for race and clinical stage. Black breast cancer patients were1.5 times more likely to die (95% confidence interval: 1.2, 1.8), after adjustingfor race; age at diagnosis; clinical stage; ER, PR, HER2 status; and recurrence. Black women with stages 0, I, II, and III breast cancer all had a statisticallysignificant longer median time from diagnosis to surgery than white women. Black patients were more likely to have advanced clinical stages of breast cancer atdiagnosis versus white patients on a citywide level in Memphis. Black breastcancer patients have higher odds of recurrence and mortality when compared withwhite breast cancer patients, after adjusting for appropriate demographic andclinical attributes. More work is needed to develop, evaluate, and disseminateinterventions to decrease inequities in timeliness of care for breast cancerpatients.PMID: 29966559  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
