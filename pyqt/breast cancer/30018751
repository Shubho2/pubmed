The characteristics with the Diagnostic Imaging using Ultrasonography, ADF(Advanced Dynamic Flow), and fine-needle-aspiration cytology (FNAC) arediscussed, comprising a very small micro-focus of radial shape, with markedlyhypoechoic echostructure, irregular margins, supplemented by peripheral vesselformation. It acquires an image which appears similar to a brisk visualization ofa dark ink stain in the normal thyroid weave. We call such a pattern "Black Ink" with ultrasonographic image and believe consistent with the infiltrating variant of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma if associated with malignant cytology afterFNA.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25621 PMCID: PMC6044379PMID: 30018751
