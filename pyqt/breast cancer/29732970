India.BACKGROUND: Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) represent an affordable, easilyscalable, stable and biocompatible drug delivery system with a high drug to lipidratio which also improves solubility of poorly soluble drugs.OBJECTIVE: SLNs were developed by using glyceryl monostearate as the single lipidin presence of surfactant Poloxamer 188 and evaluated the efficiency of the SLNs to load the therapeutic cargo, curcumin (CUR).METHOD: The nano-formulation was optimized by Quality by Design approach tounderstand the effect of various process parameters on various qualityattributes, including drug loadability, particle size and polydispersity. Thenanoparticles were characterized using Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),Fourier Transform Infra-red Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)analysis. These novel SLNs were evaluated for in-vitro anticancer activity using breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231).RESULTS: The optimized formulation had particle size of 226.802±3.92 nm with low polydispersity index of 0.244±0.018. The % encapsulation of CUR into SLNs wasfound to be 67.88±2.08 %. DSC, FT-IR and XRD confirmed that the CUR wasencapsulated stably into the lipid matrix, thereby improving the solubility ofthe drug. CUR-SLN showed sustained drug release in comparison to the free CURsolution. CUR-SLNs exhibited higher cellular uptake in human breastadenocarcinoma cells compared to free CUR at both 1 and 4 h time points. CUR-SLNsdemonstrated decreased cell viability (43.97±1.53%) compared to free CUR(59.33±0.95%) at a concentration of 50 μg/mL after 24 h treatment. Further,treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with CUR-SLNs for 24 h induced significantly higherapoptosis (37.28±5.3%) in cells compared to the free CUR (21.06±0.97%).CONCLUSION: The results provide strong rationale for further exploration of thenewly developed CUR-SLN to be utilized as a potent chemotherapeutic agent incancer therapy.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1567201815666180503120113 PMID: 29732970
