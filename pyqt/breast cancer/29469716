Solitarydermatofibromas may be incidental findings, whereas multiple dermatofibromas may be associated with systemic conditions or previous therapies. Two women and oneman with multiple dermatofibromas and an associated systemic condition,immunosuppression, or both, are described. Nine dermatofibromas developed in awoman with hypothyroidism, optic neuritis, and Arnold Chiari I malformation. Fivedermatofibromas developed in a woman with breast cancer who had received several systemic antineoplastic therapies. Eleven dermatofibromas developed in a man withHIV whose systemic therapies included acyclovir, darunavir/cobicistat,dolutegravir, etravirine, and ritonavir. Conditions associated with multipledermatofibromas include autoimmune diseases, cancer, chromosomal abnormalities,immunodeficiencies, metabolic disturbances, and altered physiologic states suchas pregnancy. Medications received by patients with multiple dermatofibromasincluded immunosuppressive agents, psoriasis therapies, and antineoplastic drugs.Multiple dermatofibromas can be observed in patients with associated medicalconditions, systemic therapies, or both. Therefore, in individuals presentingwith multiple dermatofibromas, not only evaluation for associated disorders, but also review of prior and current drug therapies, should be considered.PMID: 29469716  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
