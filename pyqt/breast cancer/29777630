Thus, finding effective prognostic markers for TNBCcould help clinicians in their ability to care for their patients. We used tissuemicroarrays (TMAs) to detect microRNA-493 (miR-493) expression in breast cancersamples. A miRCURY LNA detection probe specific for miR-493 was used in in situhybridization assays. Staining results were reviewed by two independentpathologists and classified as high or low expression of miR-493. Kaplan-Meiersurvival plots and multivariate Cox analysis were carried out to clarify therelationship between miR-493 and survival. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, patientswith high miR-493 expression had better disease-free survival than patients with low miR-493 expression. After adjusting for common clinicopathological factors inbreast cancer, the expression level of miR-493 was still a significant prognosticfactor in breast cancer. Further subtype analysis revealed that miR-493expression levels were only significantly prognostic in TNBC patients. Theseresults were validated in the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer InternationalConsortium database for overall survival. We proved the prognostic role ofmiR-493 in TNBC by using one of the largest breast cancer TMAs available andvalidated it in a large public RNA sequencing database.© 2018 The Authors.
