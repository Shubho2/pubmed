However, the anti-cancer effects and mechanism ofamentoflavone in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been elucidated. The aimof the present study was to verify the effect of amentoflavone on tumorprogression in HCC.MATERIALS AND METHODS: HCC SK-Hep1 cells were treated with differentconcentrations of amentoflavone or 10 μM PD98059 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) inhibitor) for 48 h, respectively, and then cell viability, NF-κBactivation, levels of tumor progression-associated proteins, and cell invasionwere evaluated with 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), NF-κB reporter gene assay, western blotting, and cell invasion assay.RESULTS: The results demonstrated that both amentoflavone and PD98059 not onlysignificantly reduced cell viability, NF-κB activation, and cell invasion, butalso inhibited the expression of tumor progression-associated proteins. Inaddition, we found that amentoflavone suppresses ERK phosphorylation.CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that amentoflavonedown-regulates ERK-modulated tumor progression in HCC.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11274 PMCID: PMC6000793PMID: 29695559
