Theinformation on the shape, size, and location of the tumor relative to the nipple was extracted and analyzed. We used a 3-D printing technique to produce a mold toguide BCS for breast cancer patients.RESULTS: We performed 3-D-printed mold-guided BCS in 8 breast cancer patients.All of the patients had negative surgical margins, confirmed by intraoperativeand postoperative pathologic examinations.CONCLUSION: The 3-D-printed mold-guided BCS approach is a feasible way to achievenegative surgical margins. A prospective designed cohort study, with morepatients included and a longer follow-up, is needed to further confirm itslong-term oncologic safety.Copyright © 2018.
