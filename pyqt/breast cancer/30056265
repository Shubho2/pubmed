A pvrl-4 encoded gene, NECTIN-4, haspotential roles in cancer cell growth and aggressiveness, and it is onlyexpressed in cancer cells. There is evidence that nectin-4 plays a role intumorigenesis, but the function of nectin-4 in tumor angiogenesis has lackedthorough evidence of mechanism. Using highly metastatic breast cancer cells andhuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we have developed an excellentangiogenesis model and systematically studied the contribution of nectin-4 toangiogenesis. We also provide in-depth in ovo, in vivo and in vivo evidence that nectin-4 causes angiogenesis. Following hypoxia, metastatic breast cancer stemcells (mBCSCs) driven ADAM-17 expression causes the shedding of the ecto-domainof nectin-4 into the microenvironment, which physically interacts withintegrin-β4 specifically on endothelial cells. This interaction promotesangiogenesis via the Src, PI3K, AKT, iNOS pathway and not by Phospho-Erk or NF-κβpathways. In vitro, in ovo and in vivo induction and abrogation of anangiogenesis cascade in the presence and absence of the nectin-4 ecto-domain,respectively, confirms its role in angiogenesis. Thus, disrupting the interactionbetween nectin-4 ecto-domain and integrin-β4 may provide a means of targetingmBCSC-induced angiogenesis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
