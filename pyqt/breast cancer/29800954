[Epub ahead of print]Association of Circulating Tumor Cell Status With Benefit of Radiotherapy andSurvival in Early-Stage Breast Cancer.Goodman CR(1), Seagle BL(2), Friedl TWP(3), Rack B(3), Lato K(3), Fink V(3),Cristofanilli M(4), Donnelly ED(1), Janni W(3), Shahabi S(2), Strauss JB(1).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School ofMedicine, Chicago, Illinois.(2)Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,Prentice Women's Hospital, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine,Chicago, Illinois.(3)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm,Germany.(4)Division of Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University FeinbergSchool of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.Importance: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) represent the liquid component ofsolid tumors and are a surrogate marker for residual cancer burden. Although CTC status is prognostic of recurrence and death in breast cancer, its role inguiding clinical management remains unknown.Objective: To determine whether CTC status is predictive of radiotherapeuticbenefit in early-stage breast cancer.Design, Setting, and Participants: The cohort studies in the present analysisincluded patients with stages pT1 to pT2 and pN0 to pN1 breast cancer and knownCTC status from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) and the multicenter phase 3SUCCESS clinical trial. Multivariable parametric accelerated failure time models were used to evaluate the association of CTC status and radiotherapy (RT) withsurvival outcomes. Data were collected from January 1, 2004, through December 31,2014, from the NCDB cohort. The SUCCESS trial collected data from September 1,2005, through September 30, 2013. The analyses were completed from November 1,2016, through December 17, 2017.Exposure: Adjuvant RT.Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival(LRFS), and disease-free survival (DFS).Results: A total of 1697 patients from the NCDB (16 men [0.9%] and 1681 women[99.1%]; median age, 63 years; interquartile range, 53-71 years) and 1516patients from the SUCCESS clinical trial (median age, 52 years; interquartilerange, 45-60 years) were identified. Circulating tumor cells were detected in 399patients (23.5%) in the NCDB cohort and 294 (19.4%) in the SUCCESS cohort. Theassociation of RT with survival was dependent on CTC status within the NCDBcohort (4-year OS, 94.9% for CTC-positive RT vs 88.0% for CTC-positive non-RT vs 93.9% for CTC-negative RT vs 93.4% for CTC-negative non-RT groups; P < .001) and 5-year DFS within the SUCCESS cohort (88.0% for CTC-positive RT vs 75.2% forCTC-positive non-RT vs 92.3% for CTC-negative RT vs 88.3% for CTC-negativenon-RT; P = .04). In the NCDB cohort, RT was associated with longer OS inpatients with CTCs (time ratio [TR], 2.04; 95% CI, 1.55-2.67; P < .001), but not in patients without CTCs (TR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.52-1.25; P = .33). In the SUCCESScohort, CTC-positive patients treated with RT exhibited longer LRFS (TR, 2.73;95% CI, 1.62-4.80; P < .001), DFS (TR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.22-4.13; P < .001), and OS(TR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.23-2.72; P = .003). Among patients from both cohorts whounderwent breast-conserving surgery, RT was associated with longer OS in patientswith CTCs (TR, 4.37; 95% CI, 2.71-7.05; P < .001) but not in patients withoutCTCs (TR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.47-1.62; P = .77). Radiotherapy was not associated withOS after mastectomy in CTC-positive or CTC-negative patients.Conclusions and Relevance: Treatment with RT was associated with longer LRFS,DFS, and OS in patients with early-stage breast cancer and detectable CTCs. Theseresults are hypothesis generating; a prospective trial evaluating CTC-basedmanagement for RT after breast-conserving surgery in women with early-stagebreast cancer is warranted.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.0163 PMID: 29800954
