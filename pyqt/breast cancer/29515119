However, the low specificity and toxicityof the existing HBP inhibitors prevented their use for cancer treatment. Here we report the preclinical evaluation of FR054, a novel inhibitor of the HBP enzymePGM3, with a remarkable anti-breast cancer effect. In fact, FR054 induces indifferent breast cancer cells a dramatic decrease in cell proliferation andsurvival. In particular, in a model of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)cells, MDA-MB-231, we show that these effects are correlated to FR054-dependentreduction of both N- and O-glycosylation level that cause also a strong reductionof cancer cell adhesion and migration. Moreover we show that impaired survival ofcancer cells upon FR054 treatment is associated with the activation of theUnfolded Protein Response (UPR) and accumulation of intracellular ROS. Finally,we show that FR054 suppresses cancer growth in MDA-MB-231 xenograft mice,supporting the advantage of targeting HBP for therapeutic purpose and encouragingfurther investigation about the use of this small molecule as a promisingcompound for breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0405-4 PMCID: PMC5841296PMID: 29515119
