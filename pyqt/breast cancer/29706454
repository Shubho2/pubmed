However, due to the complexity of post-transcriptionalregulation, the contribution of RNA editing to proteomic diversity in humancancers remains unclear. Here, we performed an integrated analysis of TCGAgenomic data and CPTAC proteomic data. Despite limited site diversity, wedemonstrate that A-to-I RNA editing contributes to proteomic diversity in breast cancer through changes in amino acid sequences. We validate the presence ofediting events at both RNA and protein levels. The edited COPA protein increases proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells in vitro. Our studysuggests an important contribution of A-to-I RNA editing to protein diversity in cancer and highlights its translational potential.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
