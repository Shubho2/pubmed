[Epub ahead of print]The role of tomosynthesis in intraoperative specimen evaluation.Polat YD(1), Taşkın F(1), Çildağ MB(1), Tanyeri A(1), Soyder A(2), Ergin F(3).Author information: (1)Department of Radiology, Adnan Menderes University, Aydın, Turkey.(2)Department of General Surgery, Adnan Menderes University, Aydın, Turkey.(3)Department of Public Health, Adnan Menderes University, Aydın, Turkey.To investigate the contribution of breast tomosynthesis to intraoperativespecimen evaluation in subjects with breast cancer. Approval was obtained fromthe hospital ethics committee. Specimen mammography, tomosynthesis, and, ifavailable, ultrasonography images were retrospectively assessed for 208 women whohad undergone conservative surgery at our hospital between January 2013 and April2016 after being diagnosed with breast cancer. The success of mammography,tomosynthesis, and ultrasonography in lesion detection and characterization wasevaluated. Of 208 lesions, 142 (68.3%) and 198 (95.2%) were detected bymammography and tomosynthesis, respectively. All lesions were detected in 150subjects undergoing ultrasonography (124 dense breasts, 26 fatty breasts). In 84 women who had fatty breasts, all lesions were detected both by mammography and bytomosynthesis. In 124 women with dense breasts, lesions were detected bymammography in 59 (48%) and in 114 (92%) by tomosynthesis. The success oftomosynthesis in lesion detection was found to be markedly higher thanmammography (P = .00). In conclusion, tomosynthesis contributed to mammography inspecimen evaluation in a total of 101 subjects. The success of tomosynthesis inlesion detection and characterization during intraoperative specimen evaluationis higher than mammography. In daily practice, ultrasonography is performed forlesions which cannot be evaluated by specimen mammography due to denseparenchymal pattern. Tomosynthesis may reduce the need for and the time andworkforce allocated to specimen ultrasonography in an important group ofsubjects.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13070 PMID: 29781228
