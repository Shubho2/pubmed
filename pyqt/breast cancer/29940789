Recent studies showedthat site-specific methylation of CpG sites is determined by the DNA sequencecontext surrounding the CpG site, which alludes to a possible mechanism forsite-specific aberrant DNA methylation in cancer through DNA-binding proteins. Inthis paper, DNA methylation data and RNA-Seq data of breast tumors and normaltissues in the database of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were integrated withinformation of DNA motifs in seven databases to find DNA-binding proteins andtheir binding motifs that were involved in aberrant DNA methylation in breastcancer. A total of 42,850 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that include77,298 CpG sites were detected in breast cancer. One hundred eight DNA motifswere found to be enriched in DMRs, and 109 genes encoding proteins binding tothese motifs were determined. Based on these motifs and genes, 63 methylationmodulator genes were identified to regulate differentially methylated CpG sitesin breast cancer. A network of these 63 modulator genes and 645 transcriptionfactors was constructed, and 20 network modules were determined. A number ofpathways and gene sets related to breast cancer were found to be enriched inthese network modules. The 63 methylation modulator genes identified may play an important role in aberrant methylation of CpG sites in breast cancer. They mayhelp to understand site-specific dysregulation of DNA methylation and provideepigenetic markers for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/15592294.2018.1469894 PMID: 29940789
