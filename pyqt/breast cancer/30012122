Australian guidelines for 'Cancer PainManagement in Adults' are available on the Cancer Council Australia CancerGuideline Wiki. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness andcost-effectiveness of a suite of guideline implementation strategies forimproving pain outcomes in adults with cancer in oncology and palliative careoutpatient settings.METHODS: The study will use a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled design,with oncology and palliative care outpatient services as the clusters. Patientswill be eligible if they are adults with cancer and pain presenting toparticipating services during the study period. During an initial control arm,services will routinely screen patients for average and worst pain over the past 24 h using a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) and have unfettered access toonline guidelines. During the intervention arm, staff at each service will beencouraged to use: 1) a patient education booklet and self-management resource;2) an online spaced learning cancer pain education module for clinicians fromdifferent disciplines; and 3) audit and feedback of service performance on keyindices of cancer pain screening, assessment and management. Service-basedclinical change champions will lead implementation of these strategies. Thetrial's primary outcome will be the probability that patients initially screened as having moderate-severe (≥5/10 NRS) worst pain experience a clinicallyimportant improvement one week later, defined as  ≥ 30% reduction. Secondaryoutcomes will include patient empowerment and quality of life, carer experience, and cost-effectiveness. For the main analysis, linear mixed models will be used, accounting for clustering and the longitudinal design. Eighty-two patients perservice at six services (N = 492) will provide > 90% power. A qualitativesub-study and analyses of structural and process factors will exploreopportunities for further refinement and tailoring of the intervention.DISCUSSION: This pragmatic trial will inform implementation of guidelines across a range of oncology and palliative care outpatient service contexts. If foundeffective, the implementation strategies will be made freely available on theWiki alongside the guidelines.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered 23/01/2015 on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN12615000064505 ).DOI: 10.1186/s12913-018-3318-0 PMCID: PMC6048744PMID: 30012122
