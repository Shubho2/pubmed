The treatment plans were created in a commercial treatment planningsystem (TPS), and all plans were evaluated based on PTV coverage, dosehomogeneity index (DHI), conformity index (CI), dose to organs at risk (OARs),normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and secondary cancer complication probability (SCCP). The standard VMAT alone planning technique was used as thereference for comparison.RESULTS: Both techniques produced clinically acceptable PMRT plans but with a fewsignificant differences: VMAT showed significantly better CI (0.70 vs 0.53, P <0.001) and DHI (0.12 vs 0.20, P < 0.001) over mixed beam therapy. For normaltissues, mixed beam therapy showed better OAR sparing and significantly reducedNTCP for cardiac mortality (0.23% vs 0.80%, P = 0.01) and SCCP for contralateral breast (1.7% vs 3.1% based on linear model, and 1.2% vs 1.9% based onlinear-exponential model, P < 0.001 in both cases), but showed significantlyhigher mean (50.8 Gy vs 49.3 Gy, P < 0.001) and maximum skin doses (59.7 Gy vs53.3 Gy, P < 0.001) compared with VMAT. Patients with more tissue (minimumdistance between the distal PTV surface and lung approximately > 0.5 cm andvolume of tissue between the distal PTV surface and heart or lung approximately >250 cm3 ) between distal PTV surface and lung may benefit the most from mixedbeam therapy.CONCLUSION: This work has demonstrated that mixed beam therapy (BECT + IMRT:VMAT = 4:1) produces clinically acceptable plans having reduced OAR doses and risks ofside effects compared with VMAT. Even though VMAT alone produces more homogenous and conformal dose distributions, mixed beam therapy remains as a viable optionfor treating postmastectomy patients, possibly leading to reduced normal tissuecomplications.Â© 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/mp.12958 PMCID: PMC6041175 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29749075
