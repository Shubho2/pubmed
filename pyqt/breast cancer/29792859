However, the detailed mechanism underlying ER-drivencarcinogenesis remains unclear despite extensive studies. Previously reportsindicated higher expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) myocardial infarctionassociated transcript (MIAT) in ER-positive breast cancer tissues than inER-negative tissues. However, the functional relevance of MIAT in ER-positivebreast cancer tumorigenesis was poorly understood. Here, we investigated the roleof lncRNA MIAT in ER-positive breast cancer cells. MIAT was over-expressed inER-positive breast cancer tissues and ER-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Activating estrogen signaling by diethylstilbestrol (DES) led to a dose- andtime-dependent up-regulation of MIAT in MCF-7 cells that was dependent on ERα, asevidenced by ERα silencing and pharmacological inhibition using ER antagonist ICI182780. Silencing MIAT decreased DES-induced MCF-7 cell proliferation whileoverexpressing MIAT increased MCF-7 cell proliferation. Further mechanistic studyidentified that MIAT was critical for G1 to S phase cell cycle transition. Taken together, these results suggest that lncRNA MIAT is an estrogen-inducible lncRNA and a key regulator in ER-positive breast cancer cell growth. MIAT could serve asa potential biomarker and promising therapeutic target for ER-positive breastcancer.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.05.146 PMID: 29792859
