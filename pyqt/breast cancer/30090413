Knowledge of the biosafety and biocompatibility properties of these materialswithin biological systems is very limited and needs to be evaluated before their potential bio-applications may be demonstrated. We report the in vitro and invivo bio-interactions of the Au-ZnTe nanoparticles, which were exposed to varioushuman cancer and healthy cells, an in vitro immune simulation using peripheralblood mononuclear cells, followed by the analysis of cytokine expression. Acutein vivo exposure studies using low (50 μg ml-1), intermediate (500 μg ml-1) andhigh (1500 μg ml-1) concentrations of the Au-ZnTe particles were used toinvestigate histopathological effects in rats. Normal human mammary epithelialand colon cells in addition to human breast, prostate and colon cancer cellsdisplayed cell viability between 86.4 ± 7.4% and 99.0 ± 3.6% when co-culturedwith core-shell nanoparticles for 48 hours. Acute exposure studies using ratmodels displayed no significant changes in full blood counts, liver and kidneyenzyme regulation and histopathology. These findings confirmed that Au-ZnTecore-shell nanoparticles display biosafety and biocompatibility features whichcan be exploited in future bio-applications.DOI: 10.1039/c6tx00054a PMCID: PMC6062337PMID: 30090413
