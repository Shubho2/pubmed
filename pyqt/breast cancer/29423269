The activity of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling is supported by theintracellular positioning of cellular compartments and vesicle trafficking,regulated by Rab GTPases. Here we showed that tuftelin 1 (TUFT1) was involved in the activation of mTORC1 through modulating the Rab GTPase-regulated process.TUFT1 promoted tumor growth and metastasis. Consistently, the expression of TUFT1correlated with poor prognosis in lung, breast and gastric cancers.Mechanistically, TUFT1 physically interacted with RABGAP1, thereby modulatingintracellular lysosomal positioning and vesicular trafficking, and promotedmTORC1 signaling. In addition, expression of TUFT1 predicted sensitivity toperifosine, an alkylphospholipid that alters the composition of lipid rafts.Perifosine treatment altered the positioning and trafficking of cellularcompartments to inhibit mTORC1. Our observations indicate that TUFT1 is a keyregulator of the mTORC1 pathway and suggest that it is a promising therapeutictarget or a biomarker for tumor progression.DOI: 10.1038/s41421-017-0001-2 PMCID: PMC5798889PMID: 29423269
