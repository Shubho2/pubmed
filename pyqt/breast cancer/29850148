A total of 152 patientswith the diagnosis of PDM were reviewed from March 2012 to December 2016. All of the patients underwent surgery. Data were collected regarding clinicalmanifestation, treatment, and outcomes.Results: The median age was 36 years. A subareolar breast mass was the mostfrequent symptom. The most common clinical manifestations were mass (98.0%),rubefaction (41.1%), nipple retraction (36.8%), abscess (36.8%), skin ulceration (25.7%), and mammary duct fistula (19.1%). Fourteen (9.2%) patients wererecurrent PDM at first hospitalization. Eight (5.3%) patients had prolactinoma.Five (3.3%) patients were taking antipsychotic medications. Only four (2.6%)patients were smokers. Eight patients were highly suspected to be breast cancerbefore surgery. A four-type classification system was first proposed according toclinical manifestations. The different surgeries in each category were evaluated.After 3 years median follow-up, 11 (7.2%) patients got recurrence including twoinitial recurrent PDM.Conclusions: Periductal mastitis is a distinct benign breast condition of unknownetiology. Mass, abscess and fistula are most common manifestations of thedisease. Wide surgical excision, fistulectomy and extended excision with transferof a random breast dermo-glandular flap (BDGF) are effective surgical modalities for different type of PDM.DOI: 10.21037/jtd.2018.04.22 PMCID: PMC5949503PMID: 29850148
