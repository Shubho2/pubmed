We studied post-chemotherapy ovarian recovery in women with andwithout a history of ovarian suppression during chemotherapy.METHODS: Reproductive age breast cancer patients who were seen prior tochemotherapy for fertility preservation consult were consented for follow-upovarian function assessment (every 3-6 months after chemotherapy) with antralfollicle count (AFC) in this prospective cohort study. We restricted our analysisto those with menses present after chemotherapy. Box plots were used todemonstrate the change in follow-up AFC versus time elapsed after chemotherapy. Amixed effects regression model was used to assess differences in AFC.RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients with a history of newly diagnosed breast cancerwere included. Forty-five patients (51%) had ovarian suppression with GnRHagonist (GnRHa) during chemotherapy. AFC recovery appeared to plateau at 1 yearafter completing chemotherapy at a median of 40% of pre-chemotherapy AFC. Afteradjustment for age, initial AFC, cyclophosphamide exposure, combined hormonalcontraceptive (CHC) use, and tamoxifen use, AFC recovered faster and to a greaterdegree for those women who underwent GnRHa therapy for ovarian protection during chemotherapy (P = 0.032).CONCLUSIONS: Women with menses after chemotherapy for breast cancer appear torecover their full potential AFC 1 year after their last chemotherapy dose.Treatment with GnRHa during chemotherapy is associated with a higher degree ofAFC recovery. The findings of this study can aid in counseling patients prior to chemotherapy about expectations for ovarian recovery and planning post-treatment fertility preservation care to maximize reproductive potential when pre-treatmentfertility preservation care is not possible or has limited oocyte yield.DOI: 10.1007/s10815-018-1203-8 PMID: 30066303
