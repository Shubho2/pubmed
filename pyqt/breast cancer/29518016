Weinvestigated the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet andbreast cancer risk by means of a hospital-based case-control study conducted inItaly and Switzerland. 3034 breast cancer cases and 3392 controls admitted to thesame network of hospitals for acute, non-neoplastic and non-gynaecologic diseaseswere studied. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was quantitatively measuredthrough a Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), summarizing the major characteristicsof the Mediterranean dietary pattern and ranging from 0 (lowest adherence) to 9(highest adherence). We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) of breast cancer for the MDS using multiple logistic regression models, adjusting for several covariates. Compared to a MDS of 0-3, the ORs for breast cancer were 0.86 (95% confidenceinterval, CI, 0.76-0.98) for a MDS of 4-5 and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.71-0.95) for a MDS of 6-9 (p for trend = 0.008). The exclusion of the ethanol component from the MDSdid not materially modify the ORs (e.g., OR = 0.81, 95% CI, 0.70-0.95, for MDS ≥ 6). Results were similar in pre- and post-menopausal women. Adherence to theMediterranean diet was associated with a reduced breast cancer risk.DOI: 10.3390/nu10030326 PMCID: PMC5872744PMID: 29518016
