Combination oftechnological developments such as nanomaterials, functional enzyme-mediatedreactions, and DNA nanotechnology holds great potential for high-performancedetection of miRNAs in molecular diagnostic systems. In this work, we havefabricated a cascade signal amplification platform through integratingduplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-assisted target recycling with catalytic hairpinassembly (CHA) reaction for the detection of microRNA-141 (miR-141). The targetrecycling process driven by DSN results in highly amplified translation of targetmiRNA to single-stranded connector DNA fragments. The CHA reaction is furtherinitiated by connector DNAs using hairpin-modified gold nanoparticles (HP-AuNPs) as the sensing unit, leading to the formation of AuNP network architecture on theelectrode for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical detection of miR-141 insignal-on and signal-off modes, respectively. The developed electrochemicalbiosensor exhibits a detection limit down to 25.1 aM miR-141 (60 copies in 4 Î¼Lsample) and excellent selectivity to discriminate a single base-mismatchedsequence and other miRNAs. This assay is also applied to the determination ofmiR-141 in total RNAs extracted from human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231),confirming the applicability of this method for absolute quantification ofspecific miRNAs in real-world samples. Furthermore, two-input AND and INHIBIT(INH) logic gates are constructed to detect miRNAs. In particular, the AND gateachieves cell-specific gate activation based on expression profiles of miR-141and microRNA-21 (miR-21). Therefore, our proposed cascade amplification platform has great potential applications in miRNA-related clinical diagnostics andbiochemical research.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04930 PMID: 29570270
