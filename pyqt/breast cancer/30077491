The aim ofthe study was to assess the validity of a new short self-administered 15-itemquestionnaire (QueMD) to measure adherence to the Mediterranean diet in Italy.METHODS AND RESULTS: Four-hundred and eighty three participants tocancer-screening programmes at the European Institute of Oncology, Milan (Italy) were invited to join this study. Those interested compiled the QueMD and avalidated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) reporting their usual foodconsumption during the previous six months. We derived the alternateMediterranean score (aMED) from both questionnaires with values ranging from 0(minimal adherence) to 9 (maximal adherence). Complete dietary data wereavailable for 343 individuals (participation rates 71.0%). Spearman correlationcoefficient between the responses to the 15 questions of the QueMD andcorresponding food intake derived from the FFQ ranged from 0.15 to 0.84. Amoderate correlation was found between the aMED scores calculated from the QueMD and the FFQ (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.50; 95% CI, 0.42-0.58), whileagreement between the two instruments was only poor to fair for 7 of the 9 singleitems composing the aMED score, with values ranging from 53.0% for wholegrainproducts to 79.5% for fruits.CONCLUSION: This new self-administered 15-item questionnaire could be a usefultool to assess adherence to the Mediterranean diet in the Italian population.Copyright © 2018 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and theDepartment of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.
