Since the malignant transformation involves both intra- andinter-cellular changes in the refractive index map, the tissue disordermeasurement can be used to extract important diagnosis information. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) provides a practical means of extracting this information as it maps the optical path-length difference (OPD) across a tissue sample withsub-wavelength sensitivity. In this work, we employ QPI to compare the tissuedisorder strength between benign and malignant breast tissue histology samples.Our results show that disease progression is marked by a significant increase in the disorder strength. Since our imaging system can be added as an upgradingmodule to an existing microscope, we anticipate that it can be integrated easily in the pathology work flow.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194320 PMCID: PMC5862460PMID: 29561905  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
