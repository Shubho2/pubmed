In the mammary gland, severalstudies have shown common molecular regulators between adult mammary stem cells(MaSCs) and breast cancer stem cells (bCSCs). Cell plasticity and self-renewalare essential abilities for MaSCs to maintain tissue homeostasis and regeneratethe gland after pregnancy. Intriguingly, these properties are similarly executed in breast cancer stem cells to drive tumor initiation, tumor heterogeneity andrecurrence after chemotherapy. In addition, both stem cell phenotypes arestrongly influenced by external signals from the microenvironment, immune cellsand supportive specific niches. This review focuses on the intrinsic andextrinsic connections of MaSC and bCSCs with clinical implications for breastcancer progression and their possible therapeutic applications.DOI: 10.3390/biomedicines6020050 PMCID: PMC6026898PMID: 29734696
