Acacetin, as one phytoestrogen, has been reported to exhibit estrogenicactivity. But the effect of acacetin on breast cancer cells proliferation and itsmechanism has not been explored.OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of acacetin on breast cancerMCF-7 cells proliferation and to explore its possible mechanism.METHODS: Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay was used to test the proliferation rate of MCF-7 cells. Flow cytometry was utilized to determine cell cycle. RT-qPCR andwestern blot were employed to evaluate the expressions of proliferation-relatedfactors in mRNA and protein levels.RESULTS: According to SRB assay and flow cytometric analysis, low dose ofacacetin from 10-3 to 1µM promoted the MCF-7 cells proliferation in adose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Moreover, the expressions of cellcycle-related molecules, ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT were increased after treatment with acacetin, while the increases were effectively reversed by ER antagonist ICI182,780. Further studies showed that acacetin notably induced increasing mRNA andproteins levels of ERα, which were strongly reversed by ERα antagonist MPP.CONCLUSION: Low dose of acacetin from 10-3 µM to µM promoted the proliferation ofMCF-7 cells through the ERK/PI3K/AKT pathway and its downstream cyclin signaling.And ERα is mainly responsible for acacetin promoting proliferation in MCF-7cells.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1574892813666180420154012 PMID: 29676234
