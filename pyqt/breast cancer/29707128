Pascale",Naples, Italy.(3)Surgical Pathology Unit, Istituto Nazionale Tumori-IRCCS-"Fondazione G.Pascale", Naples, Italy.Both the CC chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5/RANTES) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), releasedby mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as well as by neoplastic cells, promote breastcancer cell progression through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. In order toassess the effects of the simultaneous overexpression of RANTES and IL-6 on thetumor cell phenotype, we overexpressed both proteins in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231human breast cancer cell lines. MCF-7 cells co-expressing RANTES and IL-6 had agreater ability to form colonies in soft agar, compared to cells overexpressingRANTES or IL-6. In addition, both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 clones co-expressingRANTES and IL-6 showed a significantly higher ability to migrate and to invade.The analysis of phosphorylated ERK1/2, AKT and STAT3 signal transduction proteinsrevealed that several signaling pathways are simultaneously activated in cellsoverexpressing both factors. Finally, the overexpression of RANTES and IL-6 inMCF-7 cells significantly increased the in vivo tumor growth. Collectively, ourdata suggest that the simultaneous expression of IL-6 and RANTES produces a more aggressive phenotype in breast cancer cells and provide evidence that IL-6 andRANTES might represent potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies aimedto block the tumor-stroma interaction.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24784 PMCID: PMC5915136PMID: 29707128
