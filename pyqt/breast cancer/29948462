Post-mastectomy radiation therapy is indicated forpatients with a high risk of locoregional recurrence including locally advancedtumours (≥ 5 cm) or greater than or equal to four axillary nodes positive forbreast cancer and can be a relative contraindication to IBR. Administration ofradiation therapy pre-operatively, analogous to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mayreduce time to completion of treatment and facilitate better access to IBR.METHODS: This is a prospective pilot study in a tertiary referral breast cancerunit, comparing surgical, pathological response and oncological outcomes and timeto completion of therapy for a prospective group of patients who receivedneoadjuvant radiotherapy with a cohort of age- and stage-matched patientsrequiring post-mastectomy (± reconstruction) radiation between 2010 and 2016.RESULTS: Sixteen patients with locally advanced breast cancer underwentneoadjuvant radiation and were age- and stage-matched to 32 patients who receivedpost-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) between 2010 and 2016. Neoadjuvantradiotherapy resulted in shorter time between diagnosis and treatment completion (245.6 ± 44.2 days in the neoadjuvant group, 291.2 ± 36.7 days in the adjuvantgroup, p = 0.001). A higher proportion of patients undergoing neoadjuvantchemoradiation therapy underwent breast reconstruction (14/16 patients in theneoadjuvant group, 15/32 patients in the adjuvant group, p = 0.007) without anincrease in complication rate (p = 0.117). There was a trend towards improvedpathological complete response and survival in the neoadjuvant group.CONCLUSION: This pilot study confirms that neoadjuvant chemoradiation is afeasible way of delivering breast cancer treatment and may facilitate improvedaccess to IBR.DOI: 10.1007/s11845-018-1846-6 PMID: 29948462
