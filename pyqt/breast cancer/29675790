Data were prospectively collected. Primaryendpoint was the subtype-dependent pattern and time of recurrence. Loco-regional and distant site and time of recurrence were assessed.RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 80.8 months. For 12,053 (82.5%) of 14,595patients with primary non-metastatic invasive breast cancer a subtypeclassification was possible. The luminal A subtype had the highest 10-yearsurvival followed by luminal B and luminal/HER2. The worst survival demonstrated HER2 enriched and TNBC. HER2 and TNBC had the highest rate of recurrence in thefirst 5 years, whereas the rate of recurrence for luminal A and luminal B tumors was initially low, but remained continuously even after 10 years of follow-up.Luminal A tumors demonstrated the lowest rate of distant metastases predominantlyin bone. So did luminal B tumors. HER2 enriched subtype was characterized withincreased rate of loco-regional recurrence and distant metastases in bone, liver and brain. Luminal/HER2 had pattern of relapse similar to HER2 enriched tumors,with exception of loco-regional relapse and brain metastases. TNBC had higherrate of lung, bone and brain metastases as well as loco-regional relapse.CONCLUSION: Breast cancer subtypes are associated with different time and patternof recurrence and it should be considered during treatment decision.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2644-2 PMID: 29675790  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
