This paper systematically reviewsinterventions aiming to support patients facing the option of BR, and assessestheir effectiveness in improving a range of patient outcomes.METHODS: Ten databases were searched for articles published up to October 2017that evaluated interventions to support patient decision making about BR withincontrolled trials. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality.Descriptive analyses of patient outcomes within included studies were performed.RESULTS: The search yielded 3291 articles. Eight studies met the inclusioncriteria resulting in the evaluation of seven distinct interventions (n = 1212). Six studies were assessed to be of weak methodological quality, with one ofmoderate and one of strong quality. Three out of five interventions demonstrated a reduction in decisional conflict (ds = 0.26-0.69) and two out of threeinterventions resulted in reductions in decisional regret (ds = 0.27-3.69) atvarious time points. Treatment choice was altered in two of five studies. Therewere no changes in patient-reported anxiety levels, whilst the impact ondepression was mixed. In all studies which reported on it, improvements inpatient satisfaction and involvement in decision making were found.CONCLUSIONS: Few interventions are currently available. Whilst some findings are encouraging, improvements on patient outcomes are mixed. Further research should focus on the development and evaluation of effective interventions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.breast.2018.04.020 PMID: 29730304
