However, ourliterature search revealed no curative surgery cases for esophageal cancer inpatients with multiple primary cancers with distant metastasis.CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old woman visited our hospital with dysphagia. Shehad a history of breast cancer with multiple bone metastasis.Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a circumferential mass in the upperintrathoracic esophagus. Histopathological examination of the biopsy showedsquamous cell carcinoma. Other imaging findings revealed multiple nodules in the liver. The nodules were thought to have originated from the breast, butmetastasis of esophageal cancer was considered a possibility. Intraoperativefrozen sections of the liver and peritoneal nodules showed adenocarcinoma.Thoracoscopic esophagectomy was then performed. Following surgery, the patientreceived fulvestrant therapy, followed by capecitabine therapy, and the livertumors decreased in size. She is currently alive after 1.5 years of the surgerywithout local recurrence of esophageal cancer.DISCUSSION: Although the patient had metastatic breast cancer, her relapse-freeinterval of 20 years and good response to hormone therapy for 15 years werefavorable prognostic factors. Her life expectancy was estimated to be a few yearsand surgery was performed.CONCLUSION: Curative resection could be considered for patients with esophagealcancer who have an additional cancer with distant metastasis when the prognosisof the additional cancer is not poor.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).
