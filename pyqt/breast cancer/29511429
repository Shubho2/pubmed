Jin's formula was used to assess killingefficacy of different IRE+PDT dosing combinations in breast cancer MCF-7 cells.Flow cytometry, high-content imaging, and confocal laser scanning microscopy wereused to detect apoptosis. qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to evaluateexpression of apoptosis-related genes and proteins. IRE+PDT combination therapywas administered to BALB/C mice with breast cancer tumors in vivo; tumor size wasused to assess treatment efficacy. Killing mechanisms were examined usingtransmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. We found that IRE+PDT combination therapy produced significant synergistic killing effects in breastcancer cells (highest Jin q value of 1.32). Early apoptosis rates weresignificantly higher in the IRE+PDT group (16.0%) than in IRE-alone (7.6%) andPDT-alone (4.6%) groups (P<0.05). qRT-PCR showed higher Caspase-1, -3, -5, -6,-7, -8, and -9 and TNFRSF1A expression with IRE+PDT than with control. Westernblots showed increased cleaved Caspase-3, -7, and -9, and PARP levels in theIRE+PDT group. In vivo tumor suppression rate for IRE (1200 V)+PDT (10 mg/kg) was68.3%. Combination therapy produced the most obvious apoptosis effects. Compared with controls, the IRE+PDT group exhibited lower new blood vessel (VEGF, CD31),metastasis (TGF-β), and cell proliferation (Ki-67) indicators and higherinflammation indicator (TNF-α) 1 day post-treatment. Thus, combining IRE and PDT enhanced their anti-tumor effects in breast cancer, and apoptosis played a keyrole in this process.PMCID: PMC5835800PMID: 29511429
