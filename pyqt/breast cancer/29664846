Referral characteristics and testing outcomes were recorded for each year and compared using the Ï‡ or Fisher exact test.RESULTS: Because the implementation of this program, the number of new ovariancancer cases remained constant (109-112 cases/year) but patients referred forgenetic counseling increased annually from 37% to 43% to 96% (P < 0.05). Thepercentage of ovarian cancer patients who underwent genetic testing increasedannually from 24% to 27% to 53% (P < 0.05). The number of new breast cancerpatients was constant (1543-1638 cases/year). The percentage of patients withtriple negative breast cancer referred for genetic counseling rose from 69% in2013 to 91% in 2015; the percentage of patients who underwent testing increasedannually from 59% to 86% (P < 0.05). Of women with breast cancer diagnosed atless than 45 years of age, 78% to 85% were referred for genetic counseling acrossthis period; the percentage of patients who underwent testing increased annually from 66% to 82% (P < 0.05). Patient navigation was initiated and was available toall patients in the system during this period. Telemedicine consults wereperformed in 118 breast/ovarian patients (6%) during this period.CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive program may improve access to effective geneticcounseling services in patients with ovarian and breast cancer despite geographicbarriers.DOI: 10.1097/IGC.0000000000001256 PMID: 29664846
