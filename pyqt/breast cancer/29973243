This study evaluates theperformance of different distance metrics in predicting the need for breath-hold radiotherapy in left-sided breast cancer patients receiving adjuvantradiotherapy.METHODS: Fifty left-sided breast cancer patients treated with breast conservingsurgery and adjuvant radiotherapy to the breast from a single institution wereretrospectively studied. The left breast and organs at risk were contoured inaccordance to guidelines and a plan with tangents was obtained using thefree-breathing CT in supine position. Heart (mean heart dose (MHD), heart V25 Gy)and left anterior descending artery dosimetry were computed and compared against distance metrics under investigation (Contact Heart, 4th Arch and 5th Arch).Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to determine optimal cut-pointsfor distance metrics for dosimetric end points. Receiver operating characteristiccurves and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the associationbetween distance metrics and dosimetric endpoints. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors of dosimetric end points.RESULTS: The mean MHD and heart V25 Gy were 2.3 Gy and 10.4 cm3, respectively.With tangents, constraints for MHD (< 1.7 Gy and V25 Gy < 10 cm3) wereunattainable in 80% and 46% of patients, respectively. Optimal RPA thresholdsincluded: Contact Heart (73 mm), 4th Arch (7 mm) and 5th Arch (41 mm). Of these, the 4th Arch had the highest overall accuracy, sensitivity, concordance index andcorrelation coefficient. All metrics were statistically significant predictorsfor MHD ≥ 1.7 Gy based on univariable logistic regression. Fifth Arch did notreach significance for heart V25 Gy ≥ 10 cm3. Fourth Arch was the only predictor to remain statistically significant after multivariable analysis.CONCLUSIONS: We propose a novel "4th Arch" metric as an accurate and practicaltool to determine the need for breath-hold radiotherapy for left-sided breastcancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy with standard tangents. Further validation in an external cohort is necessary.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-1069-z PMCID: PMC6032565PMID: 29973243
