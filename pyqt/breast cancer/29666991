During the 1-year follow-up, clinical data were collected for all recalls. Screening outcome was determined for recalled womenwith or without evaluation of contralateral breast abnormalities.RESULTS: Of 3,995 recalls (recall rate 3.1%), 129 women (3.2%) underwentassessment of a contralateral, non-recalled breast abnormality. Most lesions weredetected at clinical mammography and/or breast tomosynthesis (101 women, 78.3%). The biopsy rate was similar for recalled lesions and contralateral, non-recalled lesions, but the positive predictive value of biopsy was higher for recalledlesions (p = 0.01). A comparable proportion of the recalled lesions andcontralateral, non-recalled lesions were malignant (p = 0.1). The proportion ofductal carcinoma in situ was similar for both groups, as well as invasive cancer characteristics and type of surgical treatment.CONCLUSIONS: About 3% of recalled women underwent evaluation of contralateral,non-recalled breast lesions. Evaluation of the contralateral breast after recall is important as we found that 15.5% of contralateral, non-recalled lesions weremalignant. Contralateral cancers and screen-detected cancers show similarcharacteristics, stage and surgical treatment.KEY POINTS: • 3% of recalled women underwent evaluation of contralateral,non-recalled lesions • One out of seven contralateral, non-recalled lesions wasmalignant • A contralateral cancer was diagnosed in 0.5% of recalls •Screen-detected cancers and non-recalled, contralateral cancers showed similarhistological characteristics • Tumour stage and surgical treatment were similarfor both groups.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5370-x PMID: 29666991
