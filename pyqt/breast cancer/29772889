The purpose of this study was to map theincidence of breast and cervix uteri cancer among Iranian women over a 6-yearperiod (2004-2009) searching for trend changes and risk factors. Cancer incidencedata were extracted from the annual reports of the National Cancer Registry inIran. Hierarchical Bayesian models, including random spatial and temporal effectswas utilized together with bivariate, spatio-temporal shared component modelling.The provinces Tehran, Isfahan, Mazandaran and Gilan were found to have thehighest relative risk (RR) of breast cancer, while the highest RR of cervix utericancer was observed in Tehran, Golestan, Khuzestan and Khorasan Razavi. Sharedrisk factors (smoking component) between the two cancers were seen to have thehighest influence in Tehran, Khorasan Razavi, Yazd, Isfahan, Golestan, Khuzestan,Fars and Mazandaran, while the least were observed in Kohgiluyeh Boyerahmad.Apparent differences and distinctions between high-risk and low-risk provincesreveal a pattern of obvious dispersion for these cancers in Iran that should beconsidered when allocating healthcare resources and services in different areas.DOI: 10.4081/gh.2018.645 PMID: 29772889
