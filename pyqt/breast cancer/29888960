Thegenomic response to conventional and non-conventional linear energy transferexposure is a poor investigated topic and became an issue of radiobiologicalinterest. The aim of this work was to analyze and compare molecular responses in term of gene expression profiles, induced by electron and proton irradiation inbreast cancer cell lines.METHODS: We studied the gene expression profiling differences by cDNA microarray activated in response to electron and proton irradiation with different linearenergy transfer values, among three breast cell lines (the tumorigenic MCF7 andMDA-MB-231 and the non-tumorigenic MCF10A), exposed to the same sublethal dose of9 Gy.RESULTS: Gene expression profiling pathway analyses showed the activation ofdifferent signaling and molecular networks in a cell line and radiationtype-dependent manner. MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were found to inducefactors and pathways involved in the immunological process control.CONCLUSION: Here, we describe in a detailed way the gene expression profiling andpathways activated after electron and proton irradiation in breast cancer cells. Summarizing, although specific pathways are activated in a radiationtype-dependent manner, each cell line activates overall similar molecularnetworks in response to both these two types of ionizing radiation. Advances inknowledge: In the era of personalized medicine and breast cancer target-directed intervention, we trust that this study could drive radiation therapy towardspersonalized treatments, evaluating possible combined treatments, based on themolecular characterization.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170934 PMID: 29888960
