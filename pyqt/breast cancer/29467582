It also allows for the short-term assessment ofchemotherapy response; a pathological complete responses correspond to improvedlong-term breast cancer outcomes. In sub-Saharan Africa, many patients arediagnosed with large nonresectable tumors. We examined NACT use in breast cancer patients who visited public hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa.Methods: We assessed demographic characteristics, tumor stage and grade, hormone receptor status, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status of female patientsdiagnosed with nonmetastatic invasive carcinoma of the breast at Chris HaniBaragwanath Academic Hospital between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2011. Thepatients received neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or no chemotherapy. Trastuzumab wasunavailable. We developed logistic regression models to analyze the factorsassociated with NACT receipt in these patients.Results: Of 554 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer, the median age atdiagnosis was 52 years (range: 28-88 years). Only 5.8% of patients were diagnosedwith stage I disease; 49.3% and 44.9% were diagnosed with stages II and III,respectively. Most patients had hormone-responsive tumors: luminal A, 38.1%;luminal B1 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative and highgrade), 12.5%, and luminal B2 (HER2-positive any grade), 11.6%; 11.6% had aHER2-enriched tumor and 20.6% a triple-negative tumor. Eighty (14.4%) patientswere HIV-positive. In total, 195 patients (35.2%) received NACT, 264 (47.7%)patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 95 patients (17.1%) received nochemotherapy, including 62 (11.2%) patients who received only hormonal therapy.Of patients receiving NACT, 125 (64.1%) were evaluable for clinical response.Eighty (64.0%) patients had a clinically significant response; 19 (15.2%)patients had a stable disease, and 26 (20.8%) patients had a progressive disease.Multivariate analysis showed age <40 years and disease stage to be independently associated with the receipt of NACT.Conclusion: Most women receiving NACT with available response data showed aclinical benefit. Stage III disease at diagnosis and age <40 years werepredictors of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy treatment.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S148317 PMCID: PMC5811175PMID: 29467582
