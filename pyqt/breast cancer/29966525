To verify these findings, we have repeated this experiment and the results are shown in a new Fig. 1c below. The repeated experimentalresults are consistent with the previously reported findings in the originalstudy [1] and the functional role for PRDX6 in malignant progression of humancancer including breast cancer has been widely documented and recognized innumerous other studies [2]. We apologize for the error. However, this correction does not affect the conclusions of the article.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0984-0 PMCID: PMC6027580PMID: 29966525
