[Epub ahead of print]Dichlorophenylacrylonitriles as AhR Ligands That Display Selective Breast Cancer Cytotoxicity in vitro.Baker JR(1), Gilbert J(2), Paula S(3), Zhu X(4), Sakoff JA(2), McCluskey A(1).Author information: (1)Chemistry, School of Environmental & Life Sciences, The University ofNewcastle, University Drive, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia.(2)Experimental Therapeutics Group, Department of Medical Oncology, Calvary MaterHospital, Edith Street, Waratah, NSW, 2298, Australia.(3)Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, 560 Oval Drive, West Lafayette,IN, USA.(4)Research Computing, Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP), PurdueUniversity, 155 South Grant Street, West Lafayette, IN, USA.Knoevenagel condensation of 3,4-dichloro- and 2,6-dichlorophenylacetonitrilesgave a library of dichlorophenylacrylonitriles. Our leads(Z)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)acrylonitrile (5) and(Z)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)acrylonitrile (6) displayed 0.56±0.03and 0.127±0.04 μm growth inhibition (GI50 ) and 260-fold selectivity for theMCF-7 breast cancer cell line. A 2,6-dichlorophenyl moiety saw a 10-fold decreasein potency; additional nitrogen moieties (-NO2 ) enhanced activity(Z)-2-(2,6-dichloro-3-nitrophenyl)-3-(2-nitrophenyl)acrylonitrile (26) and(Z)-2-(2,6-dichloro-3-nitrophenyl)-3-(3-nitrophenyl)acrylonitrile (27), with the corresponding -NH2 analogues(Z)-2-(3-amino-2,6-dichlorophenyl)-3-(2-aminophenyl)acrylonitrile (29) and(Z)-2-(3-amino-2,6-dichlorophenyl)-3-(3-aminophenyl)acrylonitrile (30) being morepotent. Despite this, both 29 (2.8±0.03 μm) and 30 (2.8±0.03 μm) were found to be10-fold less cytotoxic than 6. A bromine moiety effected a 3-fold enhancement in solubility with(Z)-3-(5-bromo-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acrylonitrile 18 relative to5 at 211 μg mL-1 . Modeling-guided synthesis saw the introduction of4-aminophenyl substituents(Z)-3-(4-aminophenyl)-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acrylonitrile (35) and(Z)-N-(4-(2-cyano-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)vinyl)phenyl)acetamide (38), withrespective GI50 values of 0.030±0.014 and 0.034±0.01 μm. Other analogues such as 35 and 36 were found to have sub-micromolar potency against our panel of cancercell lines (HT29, colon; U87 and SJ-G2, glioblastoma; A2780, ovarian; H460, lung;A431, skin; Du145, prostate; BE2-C, neuroblastoma; MIA, pancreas; and SMA, murineglioblastoma), except compound 38 against the U87 cell line. A more extensiveevaluation of 38 ((Z)-N-(4-(2-cyano-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)vinyl)phenyl)acetamide)in a panel of drug-resistant breast carcinoma cell lines showed 10-206 nm potencyagainst MDAMB468, T47D, ZR-75-1, SKBR3, and BT474. Molecular OperatingEnvironment docking scores showed a good correlation between predicted bindingefficiencies and observed MCF-7 cytotoxicity. This supports the use of this modelin the development of breast-cancer-specific drugs.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.DOI: 10.1002/cmdc.201800256 PMID: 29771007
