Some CP variants are also acutely toxic to aquatic organisms, especially small crustaceans. In thisstudy, thirteen CPs, including twelve new variants, were detected in thecyanobacterium Nostoc edaphicum CCNP1411 isolated from the Gulf of Gdańsk(southern Baltic Sea). Structural elucidation was performed by tandem massspectrometry with verification by NMR for CP962 and CP985. Trypsin andchymotrypsin inhibition assays confirmed the significance of the residue adjacentto 3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone (Ahp) for the activity of the peptides.Arginine-containing CPs (CPs-Arg²) inhibited trypsin at low IC50 values(0.24⁻0.26 &micro;M) and showed mild activity against chymotrypsin (IC50 3.1⁻3.8 &micro;M), while tyrosine-containing CPs (CPs-Tyr²) were selectively and potentlyactive against chymotrypsin (IC50 0.26 &micro;M). No degradation of the peptides was observed during the enzyme assays. Neither of the CPs were active againstthrombin, elastase or protein phosphatase 1. Two CPs (CP962 and CP985) had nocytotoxic effects on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Strong and selective activity of the new cyanopeptolin variants makes them potential candidates for thedevelopment of drugs against metabolic disorders and other diseases.DOI: 10.3390/md16070220 PMCID: PMC6070996PMID: 29949853
