AClassification and Regression Tree (CART) model was applied to 13 individualindicators of neoadjuvant and adjuvant breast cancer treatment, tumorcharacteristics, and patient sociodemographic variables to identify patterns withthe greatest discriminant value in predicting 5-year survival. We subsequentlyexamined the extent to which these patterns varied by the patient's SES.RESULTS: Survival probabilities associated with the 18 unique CART-identifiedpatterns ranged from 22 to 87%. The number of positive axillary nodes was thebest single discriminator between high and lower survival outcomes. The mostcommon discriminant factor among patterns with poor (< 25%) survival was theabsence of radiation treatment, followed by the presence of comorbidities, tumor size > 2 cm, and no breast surgery. Relative to high SES women, poor women werenearly four times (12.3% vs. 3.2%, p < 0.001) as likely to be classified in thepattern associated with worse survival, and less likely (31.7% vs. 52.9%,p = 0.04) to receive the pattern associated with the greatest survival.CONCLUSIONS: Greater adoption of effective patterns of care could improvesurvival of elderly women with incident breast cancer overall, and reduce SESdisparities therein.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4837-4 PMID: 29869776
