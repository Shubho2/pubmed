Email: zarghami@tbzmed.ac.irObjective: To explore the possibility of a novel chemopreventive strategy forimproving breast cancer treatment, the anticancer effects of a combination twonatural compounds, Chrysin and Metformin, against T47D breast cancer cells wereinvestigated. Materials and Methods: After treatment of T47D cells withMetformin, Chrysin and the two drugs in combination, toxicity to cancer cells wasevaluated by MTT assay. Real time PCR was then used to determine the expressionlevels of hTERT and cyclin D1 genes. Results: The MTT test findings showed thatthe combination of metformin and chrysin had high synergistic effects in killing cancer cells. In addition PCR demonstrated a significant decrease in cyclin D1and hTERT gene expression in the T47D breast cancer cell line. Conclusion: Theconmbination of metformin and chrysin suppressing hTERT and cyclin D1 geneexpression might offer an appropriate approach for breast cancer therapy.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.977 PMCID: PMC6031784PMID: 29693804
