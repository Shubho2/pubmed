Using the gain-of functionand loss-of-function strategies, we dissected the molecular mechanism responsiblefor SALL1 tumor suppressor functions.RESULTS: We demonstrated that SALL1 functions as a tumor suppressor in breastcancer, which is significantly down-regulated in the basal like breast cancer andin estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 (HER2) triple negative breast cancer patients. SALL1 expression inhuman and murine breast cancer cells inhibited cancer cell growth andproliferation, metastasis, and promoted cell cycle arrest. Knockdown of SALL1 in breast cancer cells promoted cancer cell growth, proliferation, and colonyformation. Our studies revealed that tumor suppression was mediated byrecruitment of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex by SALL1,which promoted cancer cell senescence. We further demonstrated that the mechanismof inhibition of breast cancer cell growth and invasion by SALL1-NuRD depends on the p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and mTOR signaling pathways.CONCLUSION: Our studies indicate that the developmental control gene SALL1 plays a critical role in tumor suppression by recruiting the NuRD complex and therebyinducing cell senescence in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0824-y PMCID: PMC5889587PMID: 29625565
