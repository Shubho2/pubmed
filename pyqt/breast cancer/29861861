Here, we present Aberration Hub Analysis for Cancer (AbHAC) as a novelintegrative approach to pinpoint aberration hubs, i.e. individual proteins thatinteract extensively with genes that show aberrant mutation or expression. Ouranalysis of the breast cancer data of the TCGA and the renal cancer data from theICGC shows that aberration hubs are involved in relevant cancer pathways,including factors promoting cell cycle and DNA replication in basal-like breasttumors, and Src kinase and VEGF signaling in renal carcinoma. Moreover, ouranalysis uncovers novel functionally relevant and actionable targets, among whichwe have experimentally validated abnormal splicing of spleen tyrosine kinase as akey factor for cell proliferation in renal cancer. Thus, AbHAC provides aneffective strategy to uncover novel disease factors that are only identifiable byexamining mutational and expression data in the context of biological networks.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25382 PMCID: PMC5982744PMID: 29861861
