Type1 EDR cells exhibited the best-studied mechanism of aromatase inhibitor (AI)resistance, in which estrogen receptor (ER) expression remained positive and PI3Ksignaling was upregulated. Type 2 EDR cells showed reduced ER activity andupregulated JNK-related signaling. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus reduced growthin cells similar to Type 1 EDR cells. The present study generatedeverolimus-resistant (EvR) cells from Types 1 and 2 EDR cells following long-termexposure to everolimus in vitro. These EvR cells modeled resistance to AI andeverolimus combination therapies following first-line AI treatment failure. InType 1 EvR cells, everolimus resistance was dependent on MAPK signaling; singleagents were not effective, but hormonal therapy combined with a kinase inhibitor effectively reduced cell growth. In Type 2 EvR cells, ER expression remainednegative and a JNK inhibitor was ineffective, but a Src inhibitor reduced cellgrowth. The mechanism of acquired everolimus resistance appears to vary dependingon the mechanism of AI resistance. Strategies targeting resistant tumors shouldbe tailored based on the resistance mechanisms, as these mechanisms impacttherapeutic efficacy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25133 PMCID: PMC5940386PMID: 29765553
