In this study, we sought to delineate thefunctional role of miR-92a and its regulatory pathway in gastric cancer. MiR-92a expression were underexpressed in tissues of gastric cancer patients with thearea under curve (AUC) of 0.78. Low expression in plasma was due to the increasedpromoter DNA methylation of miR-92a. Overexpression of miR-92a inhibited cellproliferation and invasion, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-92a reducedtumor growth in xenograft model. EP4 and Notch 1 were identified to be negativelyregulated by miR-92a, and involved in cell growth. Moreover, NF-κB expression wasinversely correlated with miR-92a in gastric cancer tissues and suppressed theexpression of miR-92. This study unravels the tumor suppressive role of miR-92ainvolving EP4/Notch 1 signaling regulated by NF-κB in gastric cancer. Furtherstudies on miR-92a and EP4/Notch1 may provide a new treatment strategy forgastric cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24819 PMCID: PMC5966267PMID: 29849934
