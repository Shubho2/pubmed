While PTEN itself is notconsidered a druggable target, PTEN synthetic-sick or synthetic-lethal (PTEN-SSL)genes are potential drug targets in PTEN-deficient breast cancers. Therefore,with the aim of identifying potential targets for precision breast cancertherapy, we sought to discover PTEN-SSL genes present in a broad spectrum ofbreast cancers.METHODS: To discover broad-spectrum PTEN-SSL genes in breast cancer, we used amulti-step approach that started with (1) a genome-wide short interfering RNA(siRNA) screen of ~â€‰21,000 genes in a pair of isogenic human mammary epithelialcell lines, followed by (2) a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen of ~ 1200 genesfocused on hits from the first screen in a panel of 11 breast cancer cell lines; we then determined reproducibility of hits by (3) identification of overlapsbetween our results and reanalyzed data from 3 independent gene-essentialityscreens, and finally, for selected candidate PTEN-SSL genes we (4) confirmedPTEN-SSL activity using either drug sensitivity experiments in a panel of 19 celllines or mutual exclusivity analysis of publicly available pan-cancer somaticmutation data.RESULTS: The screens (steps 1 and 2) and the reproducibility analysis (step 3)identified six candidate broad-spectrum PTEN-SSL genes (PIK3CB, ADAMTS20, AP1M2, HMMR, STK11, and NUAK1). PIK3CB was previously identified as PTEN-SSL, while the other five genes represent novel PTEN-SSL candidates. Confirmation studies (step 4) provided additional evidence that NUAK1 and STK11 have PTEN-SSL patterns ofactivity. Consistent with PTEN-SSL status, inhibition of the NUAK1 protein kinaseby the small molecule drug HTH-01-015 selectively impaired viability in multiple PTEN-deficient breast cancer cell lines, while mutations affecting STK11 and PTENwere largely mutually exclusive across large pan-cancer data sets.CONCLUSIONS: Six genes showed PTEN-SSL patterns of activity in a large proportionof PTEN-deficient breast cancer cell lines and are potential specificvulnerabilities in PTEN-deficient breast cancer. Furthermore, the NUAK1 PTEN-SSL vulnerability identified by RNA interference techniques can be recapitulated and exploited using the small molecule kinase inhibitor HTH-01-015. Thus, NUAK1inhibition may be an effective strategy for precision treatment of PTEN-deficientbreast tumors.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0949-3 PMCID: PMC5863852PMID: 29566768
