We are reporting here a young adult female,suffering from Alport syndrome with significant family history and on maintenancetwice-weekly hemodialysis (HD), had been diagnosed with triple negativeearlystage right-sided breast cancer. The patient was managed successfully withsurgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with 3 cycles of 5-flurouracil, doxorubicin,and cyclophosphamide and 3 cycles of docetaxel. In this case, our clinicalchallenge was dose reduction of chemotherapeutic agents according to creatinineclearance and timing of HD in each cycle of chemotherapy. We confronted this bydose reduction of cyclophosphamide and timing of chemotherapy was at least 12 hafter HD for each and every cycle. Patient is in regular follow-up in ourdepartment since 20 months without any recurrence of the disease.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.180680 PMID: 29516942
