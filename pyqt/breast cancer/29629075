Here weshow that novel ferrociphenols bearing a hydroxypropyl chain exhibit strongantiproliferative effects, in most cases much better than those of cisplatin,tamoxifen, or of previously described ferrociphenols devoid of this terminal OH. This is illustrated, in the case of one of these compounds, by its IC50 values of110 nM for MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cells and of 300 nM forcisplatin-resistant A2780cisR human ovarian cancer cells, and by its GI50 values lower than 100 nM towards a series of melanoma and renal cancer cell lines of theNCI-60 panel. Interestingly, oxidative metabolism of thesehydroxypropyl-ferrociphenols yields two kinds of quinone methides (QMs) thatreadily react with various nucleophiles, such as glutathione, to give 1,6- and1,8-adducts. Protonation of these quinone methides generates numerous reactivemetabolites leading eventually to many rearrangement and cleavage products. This unprecedented and fully characterized metabolic profile involving a wide range ofelectrophilic metabolites that should react with cell macromolecules may belinked to the remarkable profile of antiproliferative activities of this newseries. Indeed, the great diversity of unexpected reactive metabolites found uponoxidation will allow them to adapt to various situations present in the cancercell. These data initiate a novel strategy for the rational design of anticancer molecules, thus opening the way to new organometallic potent anticancer drugcandidates for the treatment of chemoresistant cancers.DOI: 10.1039/c7sc04213b PMCID: PMC5870192PMID: 29629075
