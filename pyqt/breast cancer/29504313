However, little is knownabout phenolics and their bioactivity in Zhangping Narcissue tea cake which isconsidered the most special kind of oolong tea. To unveil its bioactivity, three phenolic-enriched extracts were obtained from Zhangping Narcissue tea cake using ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water. Their main chemical compositions and invitro bioactivity were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Theethyl acetate fraction (ZEF) consisted of higher content of phenolics,flavonoids, procyanidins, and catechin monomers (including epigallocatechingallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and gallocatechin gallate (GCG)) than n-butanol fraction (ZBF) and water fraction (ZWF). ZEF exhibited the strongestantioxidant capacity in vitro due to its abundant bioactive compounds. This wasvalidated by Pearson correlation and hierarchical clustering analyses. ZEF alsoshowed a remarkable inhibition on the growth, migration, and invasion of 4T1murine breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1631/jzus.B1700162 PMCID: PMC5854635PMID: 29504313
