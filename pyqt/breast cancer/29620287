The role of the ER-α subtype andits co-regulator in the initiation of breast cancer and the occurrence oftamoxifen resistance remains to be further elucidated. In our previous studies,protein arginine N-methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2), a co-regulator of estrogenreceptor-α (ER-α), was confirmed to interact with ER-α66 and has the ability toinhibit cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. In the present study, we foundthat tamoxifen treatment induced a decrease in PRMT2 and an increase in ER-α36 aswell as ER-α36-mediated non-genomic effect in MDA-MB-231 cells, which wererelatively resistant to tamoxifen by contrast to MCF-7 cells. Moreover, PRMT2 wasable to interact with ER-α36 directly, suppress ER-α36 and downstream PI3K/Aktand MAPK/ERK signaling, reversing the tamoxifen resistance of breast cancercells. The present study may be meaningful for understanding the role of PRMT2 inbreast cancer progression and for developing a new endocrine therapeutic strategyfor breast cancer patients with tamoxifen resistance.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6350 PMCID: PMC5983932PMID: 29620287
