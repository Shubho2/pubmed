China.Human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 or 2 (HER1/2), and fibroblast growthfactor receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling serve critical roles in the progression ofbreast cancer; however, cross-talk between HER1/2 and FGFR1 signaling has notbeen extensively studied. In the present study, the copy number variation status of FGFR1 and HER1/2, and the clinical implications and prognostic relevance ofthis, were evaluated in invasive ductal breast cancer (IDC) tissue samples.Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridizationwere used to assess gene copy number variation in IDC samples, and the clinicalcharacteristics and survival curves of patients with IDC were analyzed. Theamplification of FGFR1 was identified in 16.0% of the samples (12 of 75), of HER1in 26.7% (20 of 75), of HER2 in 37.3% (28 of 75), and of FGFR1 and HER1/2simultaneously in 8.0% (6 of 75). FGFR1 and HER1/2 co-amplification weresignificantly correlated with distant metastasis (P=0.035), recurrence (P=0.026) and decreased disease-free survival time (P=0.042). This was the case forpatients undergoing endocrine therapy (P=0.002) and chemotherapy (P=0.044). Takentogether, the results indicate that patients with FGFR1 and HER1/2co-amplification may exhibit a less favorable prognosis compared with patientswith either FGFR1, HER1/2 amplification or without amplification.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8423 PMCID: PMC5950032PMID: 29805554
