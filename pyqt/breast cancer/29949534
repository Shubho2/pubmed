To examine the differences in total homocysteine (tHcy) plasma levels, wecompared healthy women to BC patients from a Mexican population.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tHcy plasma levels were measured usinghigh-performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector in 89 female controls and 261 BC patients.RESULTS: The observed plasma tHcy levels were significantly higher among the BCpatients (11.1019 ± 5.9161 µmol/l) compared to the controls(9.1046 ± 1.3213 µmol/l) (p = 0.002), and these differences were evident whenstratified by age (≥ 50 years old), menopause status, overweight and obesity,miscarriages, node metastases, progression, subtype classification (luminal,Her2 and triple negative) and nonresponse to chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: The tHcy plasma levels could be a good marker for the progressionand chemosensitivity of BC in the analyzed sample from a Mexican population.PMID: 29949534
