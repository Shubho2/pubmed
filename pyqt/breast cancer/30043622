Different types of elastography can be usedas new tools for measuring lesion size. Purpose To provide evidence regarding theaccuracy of tumor size measurement of strain elastography (SE), two-dimensional(2D) and three-dimensional (3D) shear wave elastography (SWE), and conventionalB-image ultrasound. Material and Methods In this prospective study, the diameter of 105 malignant breast lesions was measured by SE, 2D and 3D SWE, and B-modeultrasound. The histopathological lesion size was compared to all imaging-basedmeasuring methods. Results The mean lesion size of all breast carcinomas was1.54 cm. B-mode ultrasound underestimates breast cancer size in 65.7 % of allcases in this study ( P < 0.0001). Mean lesion size was more accuratelydetermined by SE, 2D and 3D SWE compared to B-mode ultrasound. Absolutedifferences between measured and actual lesion are smaller for B-mode ultrasound (0.26 cm) than for SE (0.41 cm) and 2D and 3D SWE (0.41 cm and 0.44 cm,respectively). Conclusion B-mode ultrasound allows more accurate lesion sizemeasurement than SE and 2D or 3D SWE but has a significantly higher risk ofunderestimating tumor size which could lead to incomplete margins during surgery.3D SWE was not superior to 2D SWE or SE but by trend more precise in predictingthe size of invasive lobular carcinoma.DOI: 10.1177/0284185118787354 PMID: 30043622
