Email: vildansimsir@yahoo.comBackground: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a sub-group of breast cancerswith a particularly poor prognosis. The results of studies investigating the roleof platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) in metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) have beenconflicting. In this meta-analysis, our aim was to assess the effectiveness ofPBCs for mTNBCs. Methods: The PubMed, Cochrane Controlled Trials RegisterDatabases, and EBSCOhost databases were accessed. The English language was usedas the search language and only human studies were included. The Newcastleâ€“OttawaQuality Assessment Scale and the Jadad scoring system were used to evaluate thequality of the included randomized controlled studies. Results: Seven studies and1,571 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS), evaluated on the basis of six studies, showed the use of PBC regimes to be related to OS in mTNBCs (HR 0.620; 95% CI 0.513-0.749;p:<0.001). Four studies containing HR and abstract statistics used for HRcalculation were included in the meta-analysis for progression-free survival(PFS). The pooled HR again indicated a significant relation (HR, 0.628; 95% CI,0.501-0.786; p:<0.001). Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we confirmed that PBCregimes provide OS and PFS advantages compared to non-PBC regimes. The use of PBCregimes could be a good choice in mTNBC patients for better quality of life andsurvival.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.5.1169 PMCID: PMC6031818PMID: 29801396
