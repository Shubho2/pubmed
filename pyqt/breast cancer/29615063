The programmed cell death (PD)-1/programmed celldeath-ligand (PD-L) 1 pathway is an important immunosuppression mechanism thatallows cancer cells to escape host immunity. The present study investigated howthe expressions of these immune checkpoint proteins affected responses toneo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer.METHODS: A total of 177 patients with resectable early-stage breast cancer weretreated with NAC. Estrogen receptor, progesteron receptor, human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2, Ki67, PD-L1, PDL-2 and PD-1 status were assessed byimmunohistochemistry.RESULTS: There were 37 (20.9%) patients with high PD-1 expression, 42 (23.7%)patients had high PD-L1 expression, and 52 (29.4%) patients had high PD-L2expression. The patients with high PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions had a significantlyhigher rate of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (p = 0.041) (p < 0.001). InTNBC, patients with high PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions had significantly higherrates of non-pCR (p = 0.003) (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis showed that PD-1and PD-L1 expressions also significantly shortened disease free survival in TNBC (p = 0.048, HR = 3.318) (p = 0.007, HR = 8.375). However, multivariate analysisfound that only PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.041,HR = 9.479).CONCLUSIONS: PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions may be useful as biomarkers to predicttreatment responses to NAC in breast cancer. Above all, PD-L1 expression may alsobe useful as biomarkers for more effective chemotherapy in TNBC.DOI: 10.1186/s12967-018-1458-y PMCID: PMC5883348PMID: 29615063
