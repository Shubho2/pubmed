Anderson Cancer Center.BACKGROUND: Obesity has been viewed as a relative contraindication againstautologous free flap breast reconstruction because of increased risks ofcomplications, including flap loss.METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective analysis of obese patientsundergoing autologous breast reconstruction.RESULTS: Overall, 72 patients (average age, 48.5 years; average body mass index, 35.7 kg/m) underwent abdominal free flap breast reconstruction. There were 43bilateral reconstructions and the remainder were unilateral (n = 115 flaps).There were 67 muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flaps (58.3 percent), 44 deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps (38.2percent), two free bipedicle DIEP flaps, one superficial inferior epigastricperforator flap, and one free TRAM flap. Forty-two patients (58.3 percent) hadprior radiation, and 51 (70.8 percent) had prior chemotherapy. Forty-threepatients (59.7 percent) underwent delayed reconstruction and 21 (29.2 percent)underwent immediate reconstruction. Eight patients (11.1 percent) had bilateralreconstruction, with one breast reconstructed in an immediate and the other in a delayed fashion. Half of the patients (n = 36) had mesh placed in an underlayfashion to reinforce the donor site. Regarding breast complications, there were11 wound dehiscences, one hematoma, one infection, and two patients withmastectomy skin flap necrosis. Twelve patients had donor-site wound healingcomplications, there were four infections, and three patients developed abulge/hernia. There were no flap losses. Comparison to historic controlsdemonstrated no significant differences in overall flap loss rates (p = 0.061) ordonor-site bulge/hernia (p = 0.86).CONCLUSION: Autologous abdominal free flaps can be performed safely in obesepatients without increased risks for donor-site bulge/hernia or flap losscompared to nonobese patients; however, patients should be counseled carefullyregarding the potential risks of complications.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004550 PMID: 29794640
