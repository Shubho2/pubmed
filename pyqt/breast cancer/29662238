Mutations that constitutively activate ERα without the need for hormone binding are frequently found in endocrine-therapy-resistantbreast cancer metastases and are associated with poor patient outcomes. Thelocation of these mutations in the ER ligand-binding domain and their impact onreceptor conformation suggest that they subvert distinct mechanisms that normallymaintain the low basal state of wild-type ERα in the absence of hormone. Suchmutations provide opportunities to probe fundamental issues underlyingligand-mediated control of ERα activity. Instructive contrasts between these ERα mutations and those that arise in the androgen receptor (AR) during anti-androgentreatment of prostate cancer highlight differences in how activation functions inERs and AR control receptor activity, how hormonal pressures (deprivation versus antagonism) drive the selection of phenotypically different mutants, how altered protein conformations can reduce antagonist potency and how alteredligand-receptor contacts can invert the response that a receptor has to anagonist ligand versus an antagonist ligand. A deeper understanding of how ligand regulation of receptor conformation is linked to receptor function offers aconceptual framework for developing new anti-oestrogens that might be moreeffective in preventing and treating breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41568-018-0001-z PMID: 29662238
