The aim of the present study was to investigate whether PTSSs is correlated with PTG among breast cancer patients in China and explore the role ofmindfulness in this relationship. A sample of 202 Chinese breast cancer patients voluntarily participated in the study by completing a set of questionnaires. The results revealed that PTSSs were significantly positively correlated with PTG.Structural equation modeling showed that mindfulness did not moderate butmediated the relation between PTSSs and PTG. These findings indicate that breast cancer patients with higher mindfulness may recover from PTSSs through adifferent process. Posttraumatic growth may not be the only positive indicator ofposttraumatic individuals.DOI: 10.1097/NMD.0000000000000854 PMID: 30020207
