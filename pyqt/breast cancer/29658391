Cancerstem cells are essential for the initiation and propagation of tumor metastasis. The objective of our current study was to define the role of cancer stem cells intransforming growth factor β1-mediated breast cancer hepatic metastases.METHOD: Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to assess the formation of breastcancer liver metastases and local invasion. Cancer stem cells surface markers(CD44, CD24, and Epithelial cell adhesion molecule [EpCAM]), luminal/mesenchymal markers (keratin8 and alpha smooth muscle actin), and proliferation markers(Ki-67 and cyclinD1) were detected by immunohistochemistry assays. Flow cytometrywas used to evaluate the effect of transforming growth factor β1 on theCD44+/CD24- cancer stem cell population. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to assess the gene expression of the stem cell self-renewalmarkers nanog, pou5f1 (coding for Oct4), and sox2.RESULTS: Transforming growth factor β1 increased the formation of livermetastases by the MDA-MB231 (MDA) breast cancer cell line but did not affect the liver metastasis of CD44+/CD24+ noncancer stem cells. Transforming growth factor β1 treatment did not significantly affect tumor proliferation in vitro or invivo. Transforming growth factor β1 promoted mammary tumor local invasion.Furthermore, the CD44high/CD24- cancer stem cell population was alsosignificantly increased by transforming growth factor β1 treatment. Besides, the gene expression of the stem cell self-renewal markers (nanog, pou5f1, and sox2)and another stem cell surface marker (EpCAM) was increased by transforming growthfactor β1 treatment. Finally, clusters of CD44-positive breast cancer cells were observed in the livers of mice from the control and transforming growth factor β1pretreatment groups.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that transforming growth factor β1 increases thelocal invasive capacity and liver metastasis of breast cancer cells by inducingthe CD44high/CD24- cancer stem cell population.DOI: 10.1177/1533033818764497 PMCID: PMC5909851PMID: 29658391
