It has beenshown that LOH in some genes could be a good prognostic marker.AIM: To performgenome-wide study on LOH in association with metastasis-free survival in breastcancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 68 patients with breast cancer. LOHstatus was detected by microarray analysis, using a high density DNA-chipCytoScanTM HD Array (Affymetrix, USA). The Chromosome Analysis Suite 3.1(Affymetrix, USA) software was used for result processing.RESULTS: 13,815 genes were examined, in order to detect LOH. The frequency of LOHvaried from 0% to 63%. The association analysis identified four genes: EDA2R,PGK1, TAF9B and CYSLTR1 that demonstrated the presence of LOH associated withmetastasis-free survival (log-rank test, p < 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: The presence of LOH in EDA2R, TAF9B, and CYSLTR1 genes is associatedwith metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients, indicating theirpotential value as prognostic markers.PMID: 29483489
