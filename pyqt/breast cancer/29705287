Therefore, we carried out a population-basedaudit of OBC practice and outcomes in Scotland.METHODS: A predefined database of patients treated with OBC was completedretrospectively in all breast units practicing OBC in Scotland.RESULTS: 589 patients were included from 11 units. Patients were diagnosedbetween September 2005 and March 2017. High volume units performed a mean of 19.3OBCs per year vs. low volume units who did 11.1 (p = 0.012). 23 differentsurgical techniques were used. High volume units offered a wider range oftechniques (8-14) than low volume units (3-6) (p = 0.004). OBC was carried out asa joint operation involving a breast and a plastic surgeon in 389 patients.Immediate contralateral symmetrisation rate was significantly higher when OBC wasperformed as a joint operation (70.7% vs. not joint operations: 29.8%;p < 0.001). The incomplete excision rate was 10.4% and was significantly higherafter surgery for invasive lobular carcinoma (18.9%; p = 0.0292), but wassignificantly lower after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (3%; p = 0.031). 9.2% ofpatients developed major complications requiring hospital admission. Overall the complication rate was significantly lower after neoadjuvant chemotherapy(p = 0.035). The 5 year local recurrence rate was 2.7%, which was higher afterOBC for DCIS (8.3%) than invasive ductal cancer (1.6%; p = 0.026). 5-yeardisease-free survival was 91.7%, overall survival was 93.8%, and cancer-specific survival was 96.1%.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that measured outcomes of OBC in apopulation-based multi-centre setting can be comparable to the outcomes of large volume single centre series.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
