The purpose of this study was to better understand this choicethrough a qualitative exploration of surgical decision-making in young survivors,including how issues particular to younger women affected their decision and the post-surgical experience.METHODS: Women age ≤ 40 years with stage 0 to III breast cancer, 1 to 3 yearsfrom diagnosis who had undergone breast cancer surgery were recruited toparticipate. Four focus groups were conducted: 2 with women who had bilateralmastectomy and 2 with women who kept their contralateral breast. Focus groupswere recorded and transcribed with identifiers removed. Emergent themes wereidentified by thematic content analysis using NVivo 11.RESULTS: Of the 20 participants, median age at diagnosis was 37 years. Emergentthemes were categorized into the following domains: (1) emotions/feelingssurrounding surgery/decision about surgery; (2) factors affecting the decision;(3) communication and interaction with the healthcare team; (4) impact onpost-surgical life and recovery; and (5) support needs. Young women who chose CPMoften were concerned about a future breast event, despite this low risk,suggesting some gain peace of mind by choosing CPM. Young survivors also had manyphysical and emotional concerns after surgery for which they did not always feel prepared.CONCLUSIONS: Informational resources and decision aids may enhance patient-doctorcommunication and help young survivors better understand risk and manageexpectations surrounding short and longer-term physical and emotional effectsafter surgery.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4683 PMID: 29476578
