Associationswith volumetric MD phenotypes (percent dense volume, absolute dense volume, andabsolute nondense volume) were estimated using linear regression adjusting forage, body mass index, menopausal status, and six principal components. We alsoestimated the proportion of MD variance explained by additive contributions from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP-based heritability [h2SNP]) in 4948participants of the cohort.RESULTS: In total, three novel MD loci were identified (at P < 5 × 10- 8): onefor percent dense volume (HABP2) and two for the absolute dense volume (INHBB,LINC01483). INHBB is an established locus for ER-negative breast cancer, andHABP2 and LINC01483 represent putative new breast cancer susceptibility loci,because both loci were associated with breast cancer in availablemeta-analysis data including 122,977 breast cancer cases and 105,974control subjects (P < 0.05). h2SNP (SE) estimates for percent dense, absolutedense, and nondense volume were 0.29 (0.07), 0.31 (0.07), and 0.25 (0.07),respectively. Corresponding ratios of h2SNP to previously observed narrow-senseh2 estimates in the same cohort were 0.46, 0.72, and 0.41, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide new insights into the genetic basis of MD andbiological mechanisms linking MD to breast cancer risk. Apart from identifyingthree novel loci, we demonstrate that at least 25% of the MD variance isexplained by common genetic variation with h2SNP/h2 ratios varying between dense and nondense MD components.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0954-6 PMCID: PMC5904990PMID: 29665850
