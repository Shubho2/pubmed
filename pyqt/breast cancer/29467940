ZB716 was previously reported as an orallybioavailable SERD structurally analogous to fulvestrant. In this study, weexamined the binding details of ZB716 to the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) bycomputer modeling to reveal its interactions with the ligand binding domain as a steroidal molecule. We also found that ZB716 modulates ERα-coregulatorinteractions in nearly identical manner to fulvestrant. The ability of ZB716 toinhibit cell growth and downregulate ER expression in endocrine resistant, ERαmutant breast cancer cells was demonstrated. Moreover, in both the MCF-7xenograft and a patient derived xenograft model, orally administered ZB716 showedsuperior efficacy in blocking tumor growth when compared to fulvestrant.Importantly, such enhanced efficacy of ZB716 was shown to be attributable to its markedly higher bioavailability, as evidenced in the final plasma and tumortissue concentrations of ZB716 in mice where drug concentrations were foundsignificantly higher than in the fulvestrant treatment group.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24023 PMCID: PMC5805526PMID: 29467940
