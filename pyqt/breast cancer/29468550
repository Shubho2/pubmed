Lis andDavid Gilmour in 1984, has been useful to detect DNA sequences where protein(s)of interest bind. ChIP is comprised of several steps: (1) cross-linking ofproteins to target DNA sequences, (2) breaking genomic DNA into 300-1000Â bppieces by sonication or nuclease digestion, (3) immunoprecipitation of proteinbound to target DNA with an antibody, (4) reverse cross-linking between targetDNA and the bound protein to liberate the DNA fragments, and (5) amplification oftarget DNA fragment by PCR. Since then, the technology has evolved significantly to allow not only amplifying target sequences by PCR, but also sequencing all DNAfragment bound to a target protein, using a variant of the approach called theChIP-seq technique (1). Another variation, the ChIP-on-ChIP, allows the detectionof protein complexes bound to specific DNA sequences (2).DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7565-5_13 PMCID: PMC6070307PMID: 29468550
