We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacyof the LS-SJ in axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in comparison to theconventional method.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-two patients with breast cancer who underwent total mastectomy and ALND were included in this study. The patients were divided intothe LS-SJ group (n=43) and the conventional-ALND (c-ALND) group (n=49).RESULTS: Patients with high body mass index values had a greater drainage volume and longer time to drain removal. The drainage volume was in the LS-SJ group was significantly lower than that in the c-ALND group. The time to drain removal and the hospitalization period were also significantly shorter in the LS-SJ group.The LS-SJ was more effective for ALND in obese patients.CONCLUSION: The results suggest the clinical usefulness of LS-SJ in ALND inpatients with breast cancer, especially in obese patients.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12483 PMID: 29599361  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
