Cabazitaxel is a taxoidthat is effective against taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and hasdistinguished itself by its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The presentphase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01934894) evaluated thecombination of these agents to treat HER2+ MBC patients with CNS metastases.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with HER2+ MBC and ≥ 1 untreated or progressive, measurable CNS metastasis were eligible. Using a 3+3 dose escalation design,patients were treated with escalating doses of intravenous cabazitaxel every 21days and oral lapatinib daily in 21-day treatment cycles. Intracranial diseaserestaging was performed every 2 cycles for the first 8 cycles and then every 3cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity.RESULTS: Eleven patients were treated at 2 dose levels. Six patients were treatedat dose level 1 (intravenous cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 plus oral lapatinib 1000 mgdaily), and five were treated at dose level 2 (intravenous cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2plus oral lapatinib 1000 mg daily). The most common treatment-related adverseevents were myelosuppression, diarrhea, fatigue, and skin toxicity. A total of 5 dose-limiting toxicity events occurred. No intra- or extracranial objectiveresponses were observed.CONCLUSION: The combination of cabazitaxel plus lapatinib was not feasiblebecause of toxicity and because no objective CNS activity was seen in the 5evaluable patients. The role of cabazitaxel to treat breast cancer patients with CNS metastases remains undefined.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.03.004 PMID: 29678476
