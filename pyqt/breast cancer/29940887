In normal breast human tissue, PRA and PRB are expressedin equimolar ratios, but isoform ratio is altered during malignant progression,usually leading to high PRA:PRB ratios. We took advantage of a transgenic mousemodel where PRA isoform is predominant (PRA transgenics) and identified the keytranscriptional events and associated pathways underlying the preneoplasticphenotype in mammary glands of PRA transgenics as compared with normal wild-type littermates.METHODS: The transcriptomic profiles of PRA transgenics and wild-type mammaryglands were generated using microarray technology. We identified differentiallyexpressed genes and analyzed clustering, gene ontology (GO), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and pathway profiles. We also performed comparisons withpublicly available gene expression data sets of human breast cancer.RESULTS: We identified a large number of differentially expressed genes whichwere mainly associated with metabolic pathways for the PRA transgenics phenotype while inflammation- related pathways were negatively correlated. Further, wedetermined a significant overlap of the pathways characterizing PRA transgenicsand those in breast cancer subtypes Luminal A and Luminal B and identified novel putative biomarkers, such as PDHB and LAMB3.CONCLUSION: The transcriptional targets identified in this study shouldfacilitate the formulation or refinement of useful molecular descriptors fordiagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4550-z PMCID: PMC6019805PMID: 29940887
