The BrighTNesstrial was designed to assess the addition of the PARP inhibitor veliparib pluscarboplatin or carboplatin alone to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy intriple-negative breast cancer.METHODS: We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial(BrighTNess) across 145 sites in 15 countries. Patients aged 18 years and olderwith previously untreated histologically or cytologically confirmed clinicalstage II-III triple-negative breast cancer, who were candidates for potentiallycurative surgery and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance statusof 0 or 1, were randomly assigned (2:1:1) by an interactive response technologysystem via permuted blocks (block size of four) within strata to receive one ofthree segment 1 regimens: paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for 12 doses)plus carboplatin (area under the curve 6 mg/mL per min, intravenously every 3weeks, for four cycles) plus veliparib (50 mg orally, twice a day); paclitaxelplus carboplatin plus veliparib placebo (twice a day); or paclitaxel pluscarboplatin placebo (every 3 weeks for four cycles) plus veliparib placebo.Following segment 1, all patients were assigned to segment 2 in which theyreceived doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide every 2-3 weeks for four cycles.Randomisation for segment 1 was stratified by germline BRCA mutation status,nodal stage, and planned schedule of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamideadministration. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response in breastand lymph nodes as determined by site pathologists following completion ofneoadjuvant therapy. Efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat and safetyanalyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.These are the first results of an ongoing clinical trial; the data cutoff for theanalyses presented was Dec 8, 2016. This study is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02032277.FINDINGS: Between April 4, 2014, and March 18, 2016, 634 patients were randomlyassigned: 316 to paclitaxel plus carboplatin plus veliparib, 160 to paclitaxelplus carboplatin, and 158 to paclitaxel alone. The proportion of patients whoachieved a pathological complete response was higher in the paclitaxel,carboplatin, and veliparib group than in patients receiving paclitaxel alone (168[53%] of 316 patients vs 49 [31%] of 158, p<0·0001), but not compared withpatients receiving paclitaxel plus carboplatin (92 [58%] of 160 patients,p=0·36). Grade 3 or 4 toxicities, and serious adverse events were more common in patients receiving carboplatin, whereas veliparib did not substantially increase toxicity. The most common grade 3 or 4 events overall were neutropenia (352 [56%]of 628 patients), anaemia (180 [29%]), and thrombocytopenia (75 [12%]) throughcomplete treatment, and febrile neutropenia (88 [15%] of 601 patients) duringsegment 2. The most common serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (80[13%] of 628 patients) and anaemia (20 [3%]).INTERPRETATION: Although the addition of veliparib and carboplatin to paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide improved the proportion of patients with triple-negative breast cancer who achieved a pathological complete response,the addition of veliparib to carboplatin and paclitaxel did not. Increasedtoxicities with the addition of carboplatin (with or without veliparib) topaclitaxel were manageable and did not substantially affect treatment delivery ofpaclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Given the consistentresults with previous studies, the addition of carboplatin appears to have afavourable risk to benefit profile and might be considered as a potentialcomponent of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with high-risk,triple-negative breast cancer.FUNDING: AbbVie.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
