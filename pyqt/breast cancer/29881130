Epub 2017 Sep 26.Multiple Testing of Submatrices of a Precision Matrix with Applications toIdentification of Between Pathway Interactions.Xia Y(1), Cai T(2), Cai TT(3).Author information: (1)Department of Statistics, Fudan University and Department of Statistics &Operations Research, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.(2)Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, HarvardUniversity.(3)Department of Statistics, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.Making accurate inference for gene regulatory networks, including inferring aboutpathway by pathway interactions, is an important and difficult task. Motivated bysuch genomic applications, we consider multiple testing for conditionaldependence between subgroups of variables. Under a Gaussian graphical modelframework, the problem is translated into simultaneous testing for a collectionof submatrices of a high-dimensional precision matrix with each submatrixsummarizing the dependence structure between two subgroups of variables. A novel multiple testing procedure is proposed and both theoretical and numericalproperties of the procedure are investigated. Asymptotic null distribution of thetest statistic for an individual hypothesis is established and the proposedmultiple testing procedure is shown to asymptotically control the false discoveryrate (FDR) and false discovery proportion (FDP) at the pre-specified level under regularity conditions. Simulations show that the procedure works well incontrolling the FDR and has good power in detecting the true interactions. Theprocedure is applied to a breast cancer gene expression study to identify betweenpathway interactions.DOI: 10.1080/01621459.2016.1251930 PMCID: PMC5988269PMID: 29881130
