In the present study, weinvestigated the molecular mechanisms of corosolic acid in cancer cell death.Corosolic acid induces a decrease of cell viability and an increase of cellcytotoxicity in human renal carcinoma Caki cells. Corosolic acid-induced celldeath is not inhibited by apoptosis inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspaseinhibitor), necroptosis inhibitor (necrostatin-1), or ferroptosis inhibitors(ferrostatin-1 and deferoxamine (DFO)). Furthermore, corosolic acid significantlyinduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, but antioxidants(N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and trolox) do not inhibit corosolic acid-induced celldeath. Interestingly, corosolic acid induces lipid oxidation, and&alpha;-tocopherol markedly prevents corosolic acid-induced lipid peroxidationand cell death. Anti-chemotherapeutic effects of &alpha;-tocopherol are dependenton inhibition of lipid oxidation rather than inhibition of ROS production. Inaddition, corosolic acid induces non-apoptotic cell death in other renal cancer(ACHN and A498), breast cancer (MDA-MB231), and hepatocellular carcinoma (SK-Hep1and Huh7) cells, and &alpha;-tocopherol markedly inhibits corosolic acid-induced cell death. Therefore, our results suggest that corosolic acid inducesnon-apoptotic cell death in cancer cells through the increase of lipidperoxidation.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19051309 PMCID: PMC5983573PMID: 29702597
