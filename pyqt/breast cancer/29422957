Flavopiridol exerts strong antitumoractivity via several mechanisms, including the induction of cell cycle arrest andapoptosis, and the modulation of transcriptional regulation. The aim of thepresent study was to determine the effect of flavopiridol on a subpopulation ofcluster of differentiation (CD)44+/CD24- human breast cancer MCF7 stem cells. TheCD44+/CD24- cells were isolated from the MCF7 cell line by fluorescence-activatedcell sorting and treated with 100, 300, 500, 750 and 1,000 nM flavopiridol for24, 48 and 72 h. Cell viability and proliferation assays were performed todetermine the inhibitory effect of flavopiridol. Gene expression profiling wasanalyzed using Illumina Human HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip microarray. According to the results, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value offlavopiridol was 500 nM in monolayer cells. Flavopiridol induced growthinhibition and cytotoxicity in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) at the IC50 dose.The present study revealed several differentially regulated genes betweenflavopiridol-treated and untreated cells. The result of the pathway analysisrevealed that flavopiridol serves an important role in translation, the ribosome biogenesis pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, the electron transport chainpathway, carbon metabolism and cell cycle. A notable result from the presentstudy is that ribosome-associated gene expression is significantly affected byflavopiridol treatment. The data of the present study indicate that flavopiridol exhibits antitumor activity against CD44+/CD24- MCF7 BCSCs through differentmechanisms, mainly by inhibiting translation and the ribosome biogenesis pathway,and could be an effective chemotherapeutic molecule to target and kill BCSCs.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7029 PMCID: PMC5770605PMID: 29422957
