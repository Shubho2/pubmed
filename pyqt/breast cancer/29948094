Recently, it has also been investigated asan alternative for immediate reconstruction in patients submitted tobreast-conserving surgery (BCS). Although good aesthetic results have beenreported, the oncologic safety of the procedure remains under investigation. Thisarticle aims to assess oncologic outcomes of patients submitted to BCS withimmediate AFG reconstruction.METHODS: This study consisted of 65 patients undergoing BCS with AFG betweenJanuary 2010 and January 2017. They were closely followed after surgery for amedian period of 40.8 months. Locoregional and systemic recurrences were theprimary endpoints of this study.RESULTS: Ten patients developed cancer recurrence (15.4%). The median time forrecurrence was 58.9 months. Only two patients presented locoregional recurrence(LRR) (3.07%). Five patients had systemic recurrence (7.69%), and three had both systemic and LRR (4.61%). Median disease-free survival (DFS) was 42.2 months, andoverall survival (OV) was 44.3 months. Recurrences were significantly associated with the number of metastatic axillary lymph nodes detected.CONCLUSION: Oncologic outcomes of immediate AFG are similar to the resultspreviously reported in BCS without AFG. Locoregional and systemic recurrences areassociated with the presence of axillary metastases.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level ofevidence to each article.
