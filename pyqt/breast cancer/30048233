By using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for2000 through 2015, we examined trends in prevalence of cancer screening thatadhered to US Preventive Services Task Force screening recommendations in orderto monitor screening progress among traditionally underserved populationsubgroups.METHODS: We analyzed NHIS data from surveys from 2000 through 2015 to estimateprevalence and trends in use of recommended screening tests for breast, cervical,colorectal, and prostate cancers. We used logistic regression and reportpredictive margins for population subgroups adjusted for various socioeconomicand demographic variables.RESULTS: Colorectal cancer screening was the only test that increased during the study period. We found disparities in prevalence of test use among subgroups for all tests examined. Factors that reduced the use of screening tests included nocontact with a doctor in the past year, no usual source of health care, and noinsurance coverage.CONCLUSION: Understanding use of cancer screening tests among differentpopulation subgroups is vital for planning public health interventions withpotential to increase screening uptake and reduce disparities in cancer morbidityand mortality. Overarching goals of Healthy People 2020 are to "achieve healthequity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups." Adjustedfindings for 2015, compared with previous years, show persistent screeningdisparities, particularly among the uninsured, and progress for colorectal cancerscreening only.DOI: 10.5888/pcd15.170465 PMID: 30048233
