Mammography is considered an effective procedure to detect early breast cancer recommended by World Health Organization.This study was aimed to evaluate breast cancer screening determinants in womenreferred to health centers of Urmia for mammography in 2017. Materials andMethods: In this descriptive-analytic cross-sectional study, 348 women referredto health centers of Urmia were selected using multistage sampling. Data werecollected using a standard questionnaire for mammography screening determinants, with a checklist including demographic characteristics, family, social andeconomic factors and midwifery background. Analysis was with SPSS softwareversion 20for descriptive and inferential statistic tests, P<0.05 beingconsidered significant. Results: The proportion performing mammography was 12%.Significant relationships were noted with income, menopause status, a history of breast cancer in close relatives, beliefs, inaccessibility, knowledge, cues toaction, emotions, self-care, and life priorities (P<0.05). There were nosignificant links with age at marriage, first age of delivery, number ofchildren, duration of breastfeeding, status of residency, education, maritalstatus, occupation, history of breastfeeding, and previous breast problems(P>0.05). Conclusions: The findings of this study showed that the status ofbreast cancer screening in participating women was not satisfactory. Therefore,promotion of screening methods by health policy makers in Iran is necessary andgiven that reliance solely on education is not sufficient, it is essential to payattention to barriers and eliminate them.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.997 PMCID: PMC6031808PMID: 29693968
