China.zhimingshao@yahoo.com.To evaluate the clinical outcomes and relationship between tumor size, lymph nodestatus, and prognosis in a large cohort of patients with triple-negative breastcancer (TNBC).849 Patients were categorized by tumor size and nodal status. TheKaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determinethe association of nodal status and tumor size with survival outcomes. A Sidakadjustment was used for pairwise group comparisons. We conducted six pairwisecomparisons between different node status. In univariate and multivariateanalyses, it was indicated that N0 patients had similar prognoses as N1 patients (P = 0.072), and the OS of both of these groups was significantly better thanthat of N2/N3 patients (N0 vs N2, P < 0.001; N0 vs N3, P < 0.001; N1 vs N2,P = 0.014; N1 vs N3, P = 0.005). In summary, we report that in Chinese patientswith triple-negative breast cancer, a greater difference in survival was observedbetween N1 and N2 than between N0 and N1, warranting the possible need of moreintensive chemotherapy for N2-3 patients. We also found that tumor size made animpact on survival when lymph nodes were extensively involved, a finding thatneeds longer follow-up and further validation.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-23999-8 PMCID: PMC5998075PMID: 29899402
