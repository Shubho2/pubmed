In situ hybridization was used to detect the expression of miR-10b in193 patients diagnosed with early invasive ductal carcinoma. Immunohistochemistrywas performed to evaluate the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)-α,progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her-2). The positive expression rate of miR-10b in patients with early invasive ductalcarcinoma with ER-α (+) or PR (+) was decreased compared with ER-α (-) or PR (-) patients (P<0.05). Furthermore, the positive expression rate of miR-10b inpatients with Her-2 (-) was significantly increased compared with patients thatwere Her-2 (+) (P=0.031). The positive expression rate of miR-10b in the luminal B subtype was significantly decreased compared with that in the luminal A, Her-2 and basal-like subtypes (P=0.037). In patients that were identified as miR-10b(+), the median disease-free survival time was significantly increased inpatients that were ER-α (+)/PR (+)/Her-2 (-) compared with patients that wereER-α (-)/PR (-)/Her-2 (+) (P<0.05). In addition, the median disease-free survivaltime was significantly decreased in Her-2 overexpression and basal-like subtypes when compared with luminal A and B subtypes (P<0.05). The molecular subtype wasan independent prognostic factor for early invasive ductal carcinoma (odds ratiosfor luminal B, Basal-like, and Her-2 overexpression were 2.900, 5.232 and 4.214, respectively; all P<0.05). Positive expression of miR-10b may also be aprognostic risk factor (odds ratio >1), though this was not statisticallysignificant (P>0.05). The present findings indicated that miR-10b-positiveexpression was correlated with the expression of ER-α, Her-2 and the molecularsubtypes of early invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2018.5797 PMCID: PMC5867397PMID: 29599829
