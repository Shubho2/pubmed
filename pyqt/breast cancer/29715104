Considering thatmeningioma shows greater tumor growth during pregnancy, can express estrogenreceptors and proliferate in response to estrogenic stimulation, the hypothesisthat this type of tumor may share molecular mechanisms that involve exposure toestrogen should be investigated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was toinvestigate the BRCA1 gene methylation profile in meningioma.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assaywas performed on 50 meningioma samples from male and female patients. Statisticalanalysis was carried out using Fisher's exact test.RESULTS: The most important finding of this study was that 100% of the malepatients over 55 years with meningioma showed BRCA1 methylated in their tumorcells.CONCLUSION: The silencing of BRCA1 through hypermethylation seems to play animportant role in meningioma.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12526 PMID: 29715104  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
