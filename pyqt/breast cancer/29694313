In any cases, a Paget'sdisease could hide an invasive ductal breast cancer.CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 77-years old man affected byAlzheimer's disease, who presented to our attention because of an ulceratedpalpable mass in the right nipple. A biopsy of the lesion showed "intra-epidermicproliferation of epitelioid cells, associated with linfo-plasmacellularinfiltration of superficial dermis, compatible with Paget's disease (pTis)". Wediscussed the case in the multidisciplinary meeting and decided to subject thepatient to surgery, so a right mastectomy plus sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) were performed. Histo-pathological examination revealed "invasive ductalcarcinoma of the breast, associated with a small component of in situ ductalcarcinoma and Paget's disease of the nipple with superficial ulceration".Resection margins were free. Sentinel lymph node was negative. Biologicalfeatures were as follows: ER 95%, PR 60%, Her-2/neu 1+, Ki-67 35%. The patientwas discharged in the third post-operative day in good conditions. In thefollowing weeks the patient's healing process was good and free of complications.CONCLUSIONS: Clinical recognition of Paget's disease is very important also inman, because it can be the alarm bell for an underlying invasive ductal breastcancer, often more aggressive than in woman.PMID: 29694313
