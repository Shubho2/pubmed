This study was designed toevaluate the binding interaction of neratinib with bovine serum albumin (BSA).Neratinib blocks HER2 signaling and is effective in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer treatment. Spectrofluorometric, UV spectrophotometric, and fouriertransform infrared (FT-IR) and molecular docking experiments were performed tostudy this interaction. The fluorescence of BSA is attributed to the presence of tryptophan (Trp) residues. The fluorescence of BSA in presence of neratinib wasstudied using the excitation wavelength of 280 nm and the emission was measuredat 300-500 nm at three different temperatures. Neratinib quenched the BSAintrinsic fluorescence by static mechanism. A complex formation occurred due tothe interaction leading to BSA absorption shift. The fluorescence, UV-absorption, three dimensional fluorescence and FT-IR data showed conformationalchanges occurred in BSA after interaction with neratinib. The binding constantvalues decreased as the temperature increased suggesting an instable complexformation at high temperature. Site I (sub-domain IIA) was observed as theprincipal binding site for neratinib. Hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals forceswere suggested to be involved in the BSA-neratinib interaction due to thenegative values of entropy and enthalpy changes.DOI: 10.3389/fchem.2018.00047 PMCID: PMC5845959PMID: 29564326
