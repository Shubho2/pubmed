Electronic address:othman.ghribi@med.und.edu.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer in the western world, affecting 1 out of approximately 22 people in their lifetime. Severalepidemiological studies suggest a positive association between high plasmacholesterol levels and colorectal cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms bywhich cholesterol may alter the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) are ill-definedas the cholesterol lowering drugs statins do not appear to decrease a patient'srisk of developing colorectal cancer. Cholesterol is metabolized to activederivatives including cholesterol oxidization products (COP), known asoxysterols, which have been shown to alter cellular proliferation. Thesemetabolites and not cholesterol per se, may therefore affect the risk ofdeveloping colorectal cancer. The cholesterol metabolite or the oxysterol27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is the most abundant oxysterol in the plasma andhas been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of several cancers includingbreast and prostate cancer. However, the role of 27-OHC in colorectal cancer has not been investigated. We treated Caco2 and SW620, two well characterized coloncancer cells with low, physiological and high concentrations of 27-OHC, and foundthat 27-OHC reduces cellular proliferation in these cells. We also found that theeffects of 27-OHC on cell proliferation are not due to cellular cytotoxicity orapoptotic cellular death. Additionally, 27-OHC-induced reduction in cellproliferation is independent of actions on its target nuclear receptors,liver-X-receptors (LXR) and estrogen receptors (ER) activation. Instead, ourstudy demonstrates that 27-OHC significantly decreases AKT activation, a majorprotein kinase involved in the pathogenesis of cancer as it regulates cell cycle progression, protein synthesis, and cellular survival. Our data shows thattreatment with 27-OHC substantially decreases the activation of AKT by reducinglevels of its active form, p-AKT, in Caco2 cells but not SW620 cells.All-together, our results show for the first time that the cholesterol metabolite27-OHC reduces cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et BiologieMoléculaire (SFBBM).
