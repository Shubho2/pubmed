Genetic deletion of CypA resulted in delayed mammary gland morphogenesis and differentiation with correspondingdecrease in Jak2/Stat5 activation; mammary gland cross-transplantation confirmed this defect was epithelial in nature. Analysis of mammary stem and progenitorpopulations revealed significant disruption of epithelial maturation. Loss ofCypA in the erbB2 transgenic mouse model revealed a marked increase in mammarytumor latency that correlated with decreased Stat5 activation, associated geneexpression, and reduced epithelial cell proliferation. These results demonstrate an important role for CypA in the regulation of Jak2/Stat5-mediated biology inmammary epithelium, identifying this isomerase as a novel target for therapeutic intervention.Significance: These findings reveal cyclophilin A functions innormal mammary epithelial development and ErbB2-driven mammary tumorigenesis and suggest therapies targeting cyclophilin A may be efficacious for breast cancertreatment.Graphical Abstract:http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/14/3877/F1.large.jpg CancerRes; 78(14); 3877-87. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-2892 PMCID: PMC6050080 [Available on 2019-07-15]PMID: 29959151
