China.RATIONALE: Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is rare subtype of breast carcinomaand is regarded as ductal carcinoma that undergoes metaplasia into a glandulargrowth pattern. Spindle cell carcinoma (SPC) is a subtype of MBC with apredominant spindle cell component.PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was a 52-year-old female with invasive ductalbreast carcinoma who underwent a modified radical mastectomy and an axillary nodedissection. A new lump was observed underneath the surgical site between thepectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles 45 days after the patient underwentsequential postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy.DIAGNOSES: It was speculated that the new lesion had developed duringpostoperative adjuvant therapy. And the new lesion was regarded as a recurrence.INTERVENTIONS: We performed a wide dissection of the tumor with negative margins.The pathology of the tumor indicated SPC. Then, the patient received chemotherapyand demonstrated a poor response.OUTCOMES: Local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis developed shortly afterwards,and the patient succumbed to the disease within 5 months.LESSONS: Local recurrence with metaplastic SPC transformed from invasive ductalbreast carcinoma during postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is rare. The failure of subsequent chemotherapy and the progression of disease indicate theaggressive nature of SPC and its decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy andradiotherapy. Further studies must be performed to improve the prognosis of thesepatients.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010739 PMCID: PMC5959442PMID: 29742739  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
