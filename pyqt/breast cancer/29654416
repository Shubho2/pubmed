Our aim was to conduct a systematic review andmeta-analysis to assess the effects of physical exercise on these outcomes inwomen who went through curative treatment of early-stage breast cancer.METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library were searched for randomized clinicaltrial comparing physical exercise (counseling or structured programs withsupervised/individualized exercise sessions) with usual care in women that wentthrough for breast cancer treatment. Primary outcomes were overall survival anddisease-free survival, while secondary outcomes were weight loss, body massindex, waist-hip ratio, percentage of body fat, and quality of life.RESULTS: We found 60 randomized clinical trials, only one of them showedmortality data; the HR for mortality was 0.45 (95% CI 0.21-0.97) for theintervention group when compared to the control group. Physical exercise wasassociated with weight reduction (- 1.36 kg, 95% CI - 2.51 to - 0.21, p = 0.02), lower body mass index (- 0.89 kg/m2, 95% CI - 1.50 to - 0.28, p < 0.01), andlower percentage of body fat (- 1.60 percentage points, 95% CI - 2.31 to - 0.88, p < 0.01). There was an increase in the quality of life (standardized meandifference of 0.45, 95% CI 0.20-0.69, p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: The articles found had heterogeneous types of intervention, but theyshowed significant effects on anthropometric measures and quality of life. Among them, only one study had mortality as outcome and it showed physical exercise as a protective intervention. Despite these findings, publication bias and poormethodological quality were presented. Physical exercise should be advised forbreast cancer survivors since it has no adverse effects and can improveanthropometrics measures and quality of life.
