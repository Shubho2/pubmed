Traditionally,myiasis was thought to affect individuals living in tropical regions, however,several cases in temperate zones have been reported. We encountered two patients with histories of malignancies that presented with complaints of myiasis, inChicago, in the spring and summer of 2016. The first patient, a 54-year-oldfemale with a history of breast cancer, presented with complaints of maggotsinfesting her postsurgical chest wounds. She was diagnosed with sepsis,cellulitis, and wound myiasis. The second patient, a 63-year-old female with ahistory of recurrent ovarian cancer, presented with complaints of passing maggotsvaginally and seeing worms mixed with her stools. She was diagnosed with internalurogenital myiasis. The first lesson that we learned from these cases is thatmyiasis can occur in individuals living in any part of the world. Second of all, for patients with accidental myiasis, a sample of the larvae should be sent foranalysis to help guide the treatment. Third of all, myiasis has been associatedwith new or recurrent malignancies, and therefore a biopsy of the affected tissueshould be sent for analysis. Finally, we learned that myiasis can serve as a formof tissue debridement; this coinciding benefit should not prevent the treatmentof accidental myiasis.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2049 PMCID: PMC5846802PMID: 29541570
