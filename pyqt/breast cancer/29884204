Moreover, CTC clusters are suggested to add prognostic information toCTC enumeration alone but their significance is unknown in patients with newlydiagnosed MBC. We aimed to evaluate whether longitudinal enumeration ofcirculating tumor cells (CTCs) and CTC clusters could improve prognostication andmonitoring of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) starting first-linetherapy.METHODS: This prospective study included 156 women with newly diagnosed MBC. CTCsand CTC clusters were detected using CellSearch technology at baseline (BL) andafter 1, 3, and 6 months of systemic therapy. The primary end point wasprogression-free survival (PFS) and the secondary end point overall survival(OS). Median follow-up time was 25 (7-69) months.RESULTS: There were 79 (52%) and 30 (20%) patients with ≥ 5 CTCs and ≥ 1 CTCcluster at baseline, respectively; both factors were significantly associatedwith impaired survival. Landmark analyses based on follow-up measurementsrevealed increasing prognostic hazard ratios for ≥ 5 CTCs and CTC clusters duringtreatment, predicting worse PFS and OS. Both factors added value to a prognostic model based on clinicopathological variables at all time points and ≥ 5 CTCs and presence of CTC clusters enhanced the model's C-index to > 0.80 at 1, 3, and6 months. Importantly, changes in CTCs during treatment were significantlycorrelated with survival and patients with a decline from ≥ 5 CTCs at BL to < 5CTCs at 1 month had a similar odds ratio for progression to patients with < 5CTCs at BL and 1 month. Stratification of patients based on CTC count and CTCclusters into four groups (0 CTCs, 1-4 CTCs, ≥ 5 CTCs, and ≥ 1 CTC + CTCclusters) demonstrated that patients with CTC clusters had significantly worsesurvival compared to patients without clusters.CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal evaluation of CTC and CTC clusters improvesprognostication and monitoring in patients with MBC starting first-line systemic therapy. The prognostic value increases over time, suggesting that changes in CTCcount are clinically relevant. The presence of CTC clusters adds significantprognostic value to CTC enumeration alone.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01322893 .
