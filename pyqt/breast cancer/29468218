Asingle intravitreal injection of bevacizumab resulted in prolonged resolution of iris neovascularization, reduction of intraocular pressure and ocular painrelief. Iris tumor regression was later noted following the reinstatement ofsystemic chemotherapy.Conclusions & importance: A single intravitreal bevacizumab injection may besufficient to achieve palliative control of neovascular glaucoma secondary toiris breast cancer metastasis. To our knowledge, this is the first case report inwhich a single intravitreal bevacizumab injection was used for the effectivemanagement of this condition.DOI: 10.1016/j.ajoc.2018.01.007 PMCID: PMC5786869PMID: 29468218
