From searching the databases PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE using MeSHterms, CINAHL terms, and Emtree, as well as free text, 19 articles were selected for further investigation.RESULTS: The scoping review illustrates how findings in weight and bodycomposition changes fluctuate over time as illustrated in 4 measure points: shortterm, 1 year, 18 months/2 years, and long term. The studies displayed differencesregarding study designs, sample sizes, treatment regimens, measure points andtechniques, and cutoff values for assessing weight changes, which make itdifficult to synthesize findings and provide strong evidence for use in clinical practice.CONCLUSION: Synthesizing findings over time illustrates the need for attention onyounger premenopausal women given chemotherapy. Weight need to be monitored forat least 2 years as short-term changes may be caused by increased body water,whereas long-term changes seem to be related with increased fat mass essentialfor risking recurrence and early death.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The diversity in methods discloses the need for theresearch community to reach consensus regarding study designs for future researchin this area.DOI: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000590 PMID: 29649080
