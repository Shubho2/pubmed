Thesignificance of PTEN mutations resulting in variable PTEN expression and theirimpact on prognosis of breast cancer is not well established. The objective ofour study was to correlate the immunohistochemical expression of PTEN in the fourmajor subtypes of breast carcinoma (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 positive, andTriple Negative) in a population of 202 African-American (AA) females with other clinicopathological factors.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed from FFPE tumorblocks from primary ductal breast carcinomas in 202 African-American females.Five micrometer sections were stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody againstPTEN. The sections were evaluated for the intensity of cytoplasmic and nuclearreactivity. Bivariate analysis was done via χ2 analysis and survivability datawas calculated via the generation of Kaplan-Meier curves (SPSS v19).RESULTS: Loss of PTEN expression was associated with ER negative (p = 0.021), PR negative (p = 0.024) and triple negative (p = 0.0024) breast ductal cancers. Itwas marginally associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.074). There was noassociation between PTEN loss and recurrence-free survival or overall survival.CONCLUSION: In our study, a statistically significant association between PTENloss and the triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) was found in AA women. PTENinhibits PI3 K resulting in decreased activation of downstream effector,mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Loss of PTEN results in cell proliferation through activation of mTOR. Targeted therapy with mTOR inhibitors might be usefulin the treatment of TNBC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
