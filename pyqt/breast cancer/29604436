More than half of breast cancer patients willdevelop metastases to the bone, liver, lung, or brain. Breast cancer brainmetastases (BCBM) confers a poor prognosis, as current therapeutic options ofsurgery, radiation, and chemotherapy rarely significantly extend life and areconsidered palliative. Within the realm of chemotherapy, the last decade has seenan explosion of novel chemotherapeutics involving targeting agents and uniquedosage forms. We provide a historical overview of BCBM chemotherapy, review themechanisms of new agents such as poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors,cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors, phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinaseinhibitors,estrogen pathway antagonists for hormone-receptor positive BCBM; tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antibodies, and conjugates for HER2+ BCBM; repurposed cytotoxicchemotherapy for triple negative BCBM; and the utilization of these new agentsand formulations in ongoing clinical trials. The mechanisms of novel dosageformulations such as nanoparticles, liposomes, pegylation, the concepts ofenhanced permeation and retention, and drugs utilizing these concepts involved inclinical trials are also discussed. These new treatments provide a promisingoutlook in the treatment of BCBM.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
