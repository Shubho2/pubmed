In Korea, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) begancovering breast reconstruction in April 2015. This study aimed to investigatetrends in mastectomy and breast reconstruction over the past 10 years and toevaluate the impact of NHIS coverage on breast reconstruction.METHODS: Nationwide data regarding mastectomy and breast reconstruction werecollected from the Korean Breast Cancer Society registry database. Multiplevariables were analyzed in the records of patients who underwent breastreconstruction from January 2005 to March 2017 at a single institution.RESULTS: At Seoul National University Hospital, the total number ofreconstruction cases increased 13-fold from 2005 to 2016. The proportion ofimmediate breast reconstruction (IBR) cases out of all cases of total mastectomy increased from 4% in 2005 to 52.0% in 2016. The proportion of delayed breastreconstruction (DBR) cases out of all cases of breast reconstruction and theoverall number of DBR cases increased from 8.8% (20 cases) in 2012 to 18.3% (76cases) in 2016. After NHIS coverage was initiated, the proportions of IBR and DBRshowed statistically significant increases (P<0.05). Among the IBR cases, thepercentage of prosthesis-based reconstructions increased significantly (P<0.05), but this trend was not found with DBR. Total mastectomy became significantly morecommon after the expansion of NHIS coverage (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Over the last decade, there has been an increase in mastectomy andbreast reconstruction, and the pace of increase accelerated after the expansionof NHIS coverage. It is expected that breast reconstruction will be a routineoption for patients with breast cancer under the NHIS.DOI: 10.5999/aps.2017.01417 PMCID: PMC5968321PMID: 29788687
