Their aberrant expressions regulated by DNAmethylation have been frequently found in various types of cancer. In the presentstudy, the DNA promoter methylation profiles of the MIR34 gene family wereanalyzed using the methylation specific polymerase chain reaction in order toclarify their association with breast and lung cancer, non‑cancerous or normaladjacent tissues. The methylation frequency of MIR34a was significantly higher inbreast cancer (49.37%) compared with normal adjacent tissues (30.38%). Themethylation frequency of MIR34b/c was 59.49 and 62.03% in breast cancer andnormal adjacent tissues, respectively. MIR34a methylation showed a significantconcordance with that of MIR34b/c only in breast cancer tissue. MIR34amethylation was significantly associated with cancer and the invasive ductalcarcinoma type of breast cancer (P=0.015 and P=0.02, respectively). Methylationfrequency of MIR34a and MIR34b/c was 48.42 and 56.84% in lung cancer, and 47.22and 51.39% in pulmonary diseases, respectively. No significant association wasobserved between the methylation status of MIR34a and MIR34b/c, and theclinicopathological features of lung cancer or with those of non‑cancerouspulmonary diseases. Promoter methylation of MIR34a and MIR34b/c occurs frequentlyand concomitantly in breast and lung cancer, as well as in pulmonary diseasestissues, but not in breast normal tissues adjacent to tumor. These results of thepresent study emphasize the involvement of MIR34 methylation in human diseases,including cancer. Furthermore, MIR34a methylation may be a promising marker for asubtype of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9182 PMID: 29916548
