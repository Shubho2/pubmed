Collagen type I alpha 1(COL1A1) is reportedly associated with the development of several human diseases.However, the functions and mechanisms of cellular expression of COL1A1 in breast cancer remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the cellularexpression of COL1A1 in breast cancer cells and patients, and its role in thedevelopment and metastasis of breast cancer.METHODS: The immunofluorescence staining was used to identify the cellularlocation of COL1A1 in breast cancer cell lines. Real-time PCR was applied tomeasuring the mRNA levels of COL1A1 and genes of interest. Wound healing andtranswell assay were performed to evaluate the effect of COL1A1 on metastasis of breast cancer cells. 97 patients with breast cancer were recruited in this study for evaluating the correlation of COL1A1 with survival and clinicopathologicalparameters.RESULTS: COL1A1 was expressed in all examined breast cancer cells. Knockdown ofCOL1A1 inhibited metastasis of breast cancer cells, with a low-level of CXCR4,independent of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. In patientswith breast cancer, cellular expression of COL1A1 was associated with ER/PRexpression and metastasis status. The increased COL1A1 level was associated with poor survival, especially in patients with ER+ breast cancer. Patients with ahigh-level of COL1A1 showed better cisplatin-based chemotherapy response.CONCLUSION: Cellular expression of COL1A1 could promote breast cancer metastasis.COL1A1 is a new prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target forbreast cancer, especially in ER+ patients.PMID: 29906404
