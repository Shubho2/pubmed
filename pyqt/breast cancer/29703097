[Epubahead of print]The sex life of women surviving breast cancer.Ghizzani A(1), Bruni S(1), Luisi S(1).Author information: (1)a Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Department of Molecular andDevelopmental Medicine , University of Siena , Siena , Italy.The diagnosis of breast cancer elicits diverse emotional responses in patientsand partners. Surviving cancer has raised new needs and caretakers mustunderstand the medical and psychological latent effects of oncology therapy.Improving patients' well-being is crucial as 19 million survivors are expected inthe next decade in the United States alone. In general, sexuality contributes to one's well-being but when it is disrupted by the occurrence of cancer, womenwithdraw emotionally, no longer feel desirable due to esthetic damage, and becomeoverwhelmed by the thought of sex. Alopecia and mastectomy elicit feelings ofunattractiveness affecting even some women with nipple sparing mastectomy.Couples who share the psychological distress of experiencing cancer should belogically included in survivorship interventions. Hence, any support offered tothe couple improves their ability to cope significantly. Treatments causingpremature ovarian failure as well as adjuvant endocrine treatments deepen theeffects of hypo-estrogenism on the genital modifications of arousal. Sexualrehabilitation with vaginal dilators and sensate focus exercises help to lessenpain, and reduce the couple's anxiety toward sex. In conclusion, caregivers must realize that surviving women are often reluctant to voice their needs, thus,efficient interventions must be available to everyone.DOI: 10.1080/09513590.2018.1467401 PMID: 29703097
