Electronic address:eufranio@ufmg.br.Morita-Baylis-Hillman acetates and α-bromonitroalkenes have been employed incascade reactions with lawsone and 2-aminonaphthoquinone for the one-potsynthesis of heterocycle fused quinonoid compounds. The reactions reported hereutilized the 1,3-binucleophilic potential of hydroxy- and aminonaphthoquinonesand the 1,2/1,3-bielectrophilic potential of bromonitroalkenes andMorita-Baylis-Hillman acetates for the synthesis of pyrrole and furan fusednaphthoquinones. The synthesized compounds were evaluated against HCT-116 (human colon carcinoma cells), PC3 (human prostate cancer cells), HL-60 (humanpromyelocytic leukemia cells), SF295 (human glioblastoma cells) and NCI-H460(human lung cancer cells) and exhibited antitumor activity with IC50 values aslow as < 2 μM. Selected compounds were also evaluated against OVCAR-8 (ovary),MX-1 (breast) and JURKAT (leukemia) cell lines. The cytotoxic potential of thequinones evaluated was also assayed using non-tumor cells, exemplified byperipheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) and L929 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
