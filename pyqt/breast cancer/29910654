To help oncologists and physicians provide optimal patient recommendations, theliterature was reviewed to find the latest guidelines for screening mammography, including benefits and perceived harms of overdiagnosis, false positives, falsenegatives, and technologic advances. For women 40-74 years of age who actuallyparticipate in screening every 1-2 years, breast cancer mortality is reduced by40%. With appropriate corrections, overdiagnosis accounts for 10% or fewer breastcancers. False positives occur in about 10% of screened women, 80% of which areresolved with additional imaging, and 10%, with breast biopsy. An importantlimitation of screening is the false negatives (15%-20%). The technologicadvances of digital breast tomosynthesis, breast ultrasonography, and magneticresonance imaging counter the false negatives of screening mammography,particularly in women with dense breast tissue.DOI: 10.3747/co.25.3770 PMCID: PMC6001765PMID: 29910654
