Sviluppo Terapie Innovative, OspedalePoliclinico San Martino, Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Specialties (DIMI), University of Genova, Genova, Italy.Single-agent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have beenapproved as the first targeted therapy available for patients with BRCA-mutatedHER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. This meta-analysis aimed to betterevaluate activity, efficacy and safety of single-agent PARPi in this population. A systematic search of Medline, Embase and conference proceedings up to 31January 2018 was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs)investigating single-agent PARPi versus monochemotherapy in patients withBRCA-mutated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Using the random-effectmodel, we calculated summary risk estimates (pooled HR and OR with 95% CI) forprogression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate(ORR), any grade and grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs), treatment discontinuationrate and time to deterioration in quality of life (QoL). Two RCTs (n=733) wereincluded. As compared with monochemotherapy, single-agent PARPi significantlyimproved PFS (HR 0.56(95% CI 0.45 to 0.70)) and ORR (OR 4.15 (95% CI 2.82 to6.10)), with no difference in OS (HR 0.82 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.05)). Single-agentPARPi significantly increased risk of anaemia and any grade headache, but reducedrisk of neutropenia and any grade palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome ascompared with monochemotherapy. No significant differences in other AEs andtreatment discontinuation rate were observed. Patients treated with PARPiexperienced a significant delayed time to QoL deterioration (HR 0.40 (95% CI 0.29to 0.54)). Single-agent PARPi showed to be an effective, well tolerated anduseful treatment in maintaining QoL of patients with BRCA-mutated HER2-negativemetastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.1136/esmoopen-2018-000361 PMCID: PMC6012556PMID: 29942664
