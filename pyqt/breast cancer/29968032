Fat necrosis (FN), a benigncomplication of AFG, can raise suspicion of malignancy and require furtherevaluation.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of FN in patientswho have undergone AFG following mastectomy and reconstruction, and to identifyfactors contributing to FN.METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients who received AFG following mastectomy and reconstruction at our institution between 2011 and2016, with a minimum 6-month follow-up period. Patient information, operativedetails, receipt of radiation, complications, and incidence of cancer recurrence were collected.RESULTS: A total of 171 patients were included in this study. AFG was performedby seven surgeons. Patients received an average of 1.18 treatments, with average follow-up of 26 months. Eighteen patients (10.5%) developed FN an average of3.4 months following AFG. Patients with a larger volume injected at initialsession (p = 0.044) and longer length of follow-up (p = 0.026) had significantincreases in risk of developing FN. Core needle biopsy was performed in sevenpatients and two patients required excision. The rate of cancer recurrence was1.7% for all patients and 0% in the AFG cohort.CONCLUSIONS: Increased risk of FN following AFG is associated with greater volumeinjected at the initial session and higher incidence over time. Although AFG isoncologically safe, patients should be counseled on the 10.5% incidence of FNpresenting as a palpable abnormality, and the approximately 5% chance ofrequiring biopsy or excision.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6597-0 PMID: 29968032
