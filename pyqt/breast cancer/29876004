Here we tested theefficacy of NEDD9's domains in stimulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)secretion and invadopodia formation in cells stably expressing various NEDD9mutants. Replacement of the 13 YxxP motif substrate domain (SD) tyrosines and theC-terminal Y629 with phenylalanines (F14NEDD9) eliminated tyrosinephosphorylation, MMP9 secretion and loss of invadopodia formation. Mutation ofthe N-terminal SH3 domain Y12 to glutamic acid (Y12ENEDD9) or phenylalanine(Y12FNEDD9) reduced MMP9 secretion and inhibited invadopodia formation. SH3domain deletion (∆SH3NEDD9) resulted in the loss of MMP9 secretion and a lack of invadopodia formation. The SH3-SD domain (SSNEDD9) construct exhibited tyrosinephosphorylation and stimulated MMP9 secretion, as did ∆CTNEDD9 which lacked theC-terminus (∆C-terminal; ∆CT). E13NEDD9 expression blocked MMP9 secretion andinvadopodia formation. MICAL1 (molecule interacting with Cas-L1) silencing with ashort hairpin RNA reduced MMP9 secretion, vimentin and E-cadherin levels whileincreasing N-cadherin and Rab6 levels, consistent with reduced invasive behavior.These findings indicate that NEDD9 SD phosphorylation and SH3 domain interactionsare necessary for increasing MMP9 secretion and invadopodia formation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25347 PMCID: PMC5986644PMID: 29876004
