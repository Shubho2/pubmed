Electronic address: jsc@uma.pt.The worldwide high cancer incidence and mortality demands for more effective and specific diagnostic strategies. In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of an innovative methodology, Needle Trap Microextraction (NTME), combined with gaschromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), for the establishment of the urinaryvolatomic biosignature from breast (BC), and colon (CC) cancer patients as wellas healthy individuals (CTL). To achieve this, 40 mL of the headspace ofacidified urine (4 mL, 20% NaCl, pH = 2), equilibrated at 50 °C during 40 min,were loaded through the DVB/Car1000/CarX sorbent inside the NTD, and subjected toa GC-MS analysis. This allowed the identification of 130 VOMs from differentchemical families that were further processed using discriminant analysis throughthe partial least squares method (PLS-DA). Several pathways are over activated incancer patients, being phenylalanine pathway in BC and limonene and pinenedegradation pathway in CC the most relevant. Butanoate metabolism is also highly activated in both cancers, as well as tyrosine metabolism in a lesser extension. In BC the xenobiotics metabolism by cytochrome P450 and fatty acid biosynthesisare also differentially activated. Different clusters corresponding to the groupsrecruited allowed to define sets of volatile organic metabolites (VOMsfingerprints) that exhibit high classification rates, sensitivity and specificityin the discrimination of the selected cancers. As far as we are aware, this isthe first time that NTME is used for isolation urinary volatile metabolites,being the obtained results very promising.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
