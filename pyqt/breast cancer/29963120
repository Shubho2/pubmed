Although EPC bydefinition lacks a peripheral myoepithelial layer, all previously publishedapocrine EPC cases were clinically indolent and lacked a conventional invasivecomponent. Herein, we report the 11th case of apocrine EPC, which had aconventional invasive carcinoma component and provides evidence of the malignant potential of this entity. We postulate that apocrine EPC is most likely amorphological variant of conventional EPC, with the same unpredictable malignant potential as non-apocrine cases.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.227 PMCID: PMC6015972PMID: 29963120
