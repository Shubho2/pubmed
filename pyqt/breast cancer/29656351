Colorectal cancer is the fourth leading cause of death in men(7.6%) and the third in women (8.6%). A multidisciplinary approach has radically changed the way we deal with this disease among all specialist fields.PURPOSE: In this study, we propose comparing the multidisciplinary experiencegroup (started in 2012) of S. Anna Hospital (University of Ferrara) with theprevious approach to rectal cancer before the advent of the multidisciplinaryprogram.RESULTS: We find that more study depth of neoplastic disease as well as of eachindividual patient leads to more accurate staging and to a weighted therapy basedon the needs of the individual. All the studies were performed in accordance withthe guidelines established by the European and Italian associations.DOI: 10.1007/s12029-018-0100-9 PMID: 29656351
