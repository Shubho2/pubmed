Ease of access and processing paired with therapeutic promise make SVFcells an attractive option for autologous applications in regenerative medicine. However, inherent variability in SVF cell therapeutic potential from one patient to another hinders prognosis determination for any one person. This studyinvestigated the regenerative properties and inflammation responses of thirteen, medically diverse human donors. Using non-expanded primary lipoaspirate samples, SVF cells were assessed for robustness of several parameters integral to tissueregeneration, including yield, viability, self-renewal capacity, proliferation,differentiation potential, and immunomodulatory cytokine secretion. Eachparameter was selected either for its role in regenerative potential, definedhere as the ability to heal tissues through stem cell repopulation and subsequentmultipotent differentiation, or for its potential role in wound healing throughtrophic immunomodulatory activity. These data were then analyzed for consistentand predictable patterns between and across measurements, while alsoinvestigating the influence of the donors' relevant medical histories,particularly if the donor was in remission following breast cancer treatment.Analyses identified positive correlations among the expression of threecytokines: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein(MCP)-1. The expression of these cytokines also positively related toself-renewal capacity. These results are potentially relevant for establishingexpectations in both preclinical experiments and targeted clinical treatmentstrategies that use stem cells from patients with diverse medical histories.DOI: 10.1007/s12015-018-9813-1 PMCID: PMC6014910 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29663271
