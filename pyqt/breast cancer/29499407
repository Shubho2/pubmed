Electronicaddress: ligenl@umac.mo.Physalin B (PB), one of the major active steroidal constituents of Capegooseberry (Physalis alkekengi L.), possesses a wide spectrum of biologicalactivities. Although the anticancer activity of PB was reported in previousstudies, the underlying mechanisms are still not well stated. In this study, the anticancer effect and the underlying mechanisms of PB were investigated in breastcancer cells. PB significantly reduced the viability of three human breast cancercell lines, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and T-47D, in a concentration- and time-dependentmanner. PB induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and promoted cleavage of PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase), caspases 3, caspase 7 and caspase 9 to stimulate cell apoptosis. Further studies showed that PB induced breast cancer cellsapoptosis in a p53-dependent manner in MCF-7 cells. PB also suppressed thephosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B) and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase),and increased the phosphorylation of GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β). Taken together, our results indicated that PB might serve as a potential therapeuticagent for breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
