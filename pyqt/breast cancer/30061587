Large-scale international RT clinical trials have been fundamentalin driving evidence-based change and have served to improve cancer management andto reduce side effects. Radiation therapy trials have also improved practice byincreasing quality assurance and consistency in treatment protocols acrossmultiple centres. This review summarises some of the key RT practice-changingclinical trials over the last two decades, in four common cancer sites for which RT is a crucial component of curative treatment: breast, lung, urological andlower gastro-intestinal cancer. We highlight the global inequality in access toRT, and the work of international organisations, such as the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA), the European SocieTy for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO),and the United Kingdom National Cancer Research Institute Clinical andTranslational Radiotherapy Research Working Group (CTRad), that aim to improveaccess to RT and facilitate radiation research. We discuss some emerging RTtechnologies including proton beam therapy and magnetic resonance linearaccelerators and predict likely future directions in clinical RT research.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0201-z PMID: 30061587
