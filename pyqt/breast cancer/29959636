Furthermore, counting numerouscells can be laborious for pathologists. Digital image analysis forimmunohistochemical analysis was recently developed; however, the clinicalefficacy of the Ki-67 index obtained using image analysis is unknown.METHODS: We retrospectively identified female patients with breast cancer withimmunohistochemical Ki-67 and survival data using the pathology database at theTokai University, Japan. Ki-67 expression was scored by three pathologists.Slides were scanned and converted to virtual slides; Ki-67-positive cells werecounted using image analysis. Ki-67 indices obtained by the pathologist's scoringand image analysis were evaluated by 2 × 2 analysis. Relationships between Ki-67 index and survival outcomes were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method andcompared using the log-rank test.RESULTS: Based on the 2 × 2 analysis, Ki-67 index obtained using image analysiswas moderately correlated with the pathologist's scoring for all patients (κ0.41; sensitivity, 0.573; specificity, 0.878). Poorer relapse-free survival wasassociated with high Ki-67 index than with low Ki-67 index for estrogenreceptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, and stage Ior II patients scored by pathologists (p < 0.001) and obtained using imageanalysis (p = 0.031).CONCLUSIONS: The Ki-67 indices obtained using image analysis were moderatelycorrelated with those scored by pathologists. Digital image analysis can beeffective for measuring Ki-67 values, because they are associated withrelapse-free survival in estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2-negative, and patients at stage I or II.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0885-1 PMID: 29959636
