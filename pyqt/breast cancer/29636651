It is most commonly performed by transferringcombined deep inferior epigastric artery perforator and superficial inguinallymph node flaps for postmastectomy breast reconstruction. For patients who donot require or are unable to undergo free abdominal breast reconstruction or havelymphedema affecting the lower extremity, several other VLNT options areavailable. These include flaps harvested from within the axillary, inguinal, orcervical lymph node basins, and lymph node flaps from within the abdominalcavity. This article reviews the lymph node flap options and techniques availablefor VLNT for lymphedema.DOI: 10.1055/s-0038-1632401 PMCID: PMC5891655 [Available on 2019-02-01]PMID: 29636651
