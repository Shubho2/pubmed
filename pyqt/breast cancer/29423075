However, the associations among polymorphisms on HOTAIR, breast cancer(BC) susceptibility and clinical outcomes have remained obscure. In thiscase-control study, we assessed the interaction between three lncRNA HOTAIRsingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1899663, rs4759314 and rs7958904) onthe risk and clinical outcome of breast cancer in a Chinese Han population. Intotal, 969 breast cancer cases and 970 healthy controls were enrolled in thisstudy. Associations among genotypes, BC risk and survival were evaluated byunivariate and multivariate logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The disease-free survival(DFS) and overall survival (OS) was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Wefound that the T allele of rs1899663 and C allele of rs7958904 both achievedsignificant differences between cases and controls in the single locus analyses(P = 0.017 and 0.010, respectively). Multivariate analyses also revealed thers1899663 TT genotype and rs7958904 CC genotype were both at higher risk ofbreast cancer compared with the GG homozygotes (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.20-3.60 andOR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.01-2.08, respectively). In survival analysis, we observedthat the T allele of rs1899663 presented significant differences for both DFS (HR= 1.64, 95% CI = 1.12-2.40) and OS (HR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.29-3.42) in youngersubjects (age â‰¤ 40). Our findings may provide new insights into the associations among the genetic susceptibility, the fine classifications and the prognosis ofbreast cancer. Further studies with larger sample size and functional researchshould also be conducted to validate our findings and better elucidate theunderlying biological mechanisms.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23343 PMCID: PMC5790492PMID: 29423075
