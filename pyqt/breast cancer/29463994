However, howSIX3 contributes to tumorigenesis and metastasis is poorly understood.METHODS: Weemployed affinity purification and mass spectrometry (MS) to identify theproteins physically associated with SIX3. Genome-wide analysis of theSIX3/LSD1/NuRD(MTA3) complex using a chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chipapproach identified a cohort of target genes including WNT1 and FOXC2, which are critically involved in cell proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition. Also, we used flow cytometry, growth curve analysis, EdUincorporation assay, colony formation assays, trans-well invasion assays,immunohistochemical staining and in vivo bioluminescence assay to investigate thefunction of SIX3 in tumorigenesis.RESULTS: We demonstrate that the SIX3/LSD1/NuRD(MTA3) complex inhibitscarcinogenesis in breast cancer cells and suppresses metastasis in breast cancer.SIX3 expression is downregulated in various human cancers and high SIX3 iscorrelated with improved prognosis.CONCLUSION: Our study revealed an important mechanistic link between the loss of function of SIX3 and tumor progression, identified a molecular basis for theopposing actions of MTA1 and MTA3, and may provide new potential prognosticindicators and targets for cancer therapy.DOI: 10.7150/thno.22328 PMCID: PMC5817105PMID: 29463994
