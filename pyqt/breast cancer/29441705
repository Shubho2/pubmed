Here,covalent and ionic crosslinking of cryogels are combined with the hypothesis thatthis will result in a tough MA-alginate cryogel with improved injectability. All tough cryogels can be injected through a smaller, 18G needle without sustainingany damage, while covalently crosslinked-only cryogels break after injection.Cytosine-phosphodiester-guanine (CpG)-delivering tough cryogels effectivelyactivate dendritic cells (DCs). Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor releasing tough cryogels recruit four times more DCs than blank gels by day 7 in vivo. The tough cryogel vaccine induces strong antigen-specific cytotoxicT-lymphocyte and humoral responses. These vaccines prevent tumor formation in 80%of mice inoculated with HER2/neu-overexpressing DD breast cancer cells. TheMA-alginate tough cryogels provide a promising minimally invasive deliveryplatform for cancer vaccinations.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
