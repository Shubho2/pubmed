The purpose was to evaluate the correlationof tumor tissue OCT4 and SOX2 expressions with clinicopathological features andoverall survival (OS) in surgical TNBC patients.METHODS: 127 surgical patients with TNBC were enrolled in this cohort study.Tumor tissue samples were obtained during the operation. OCT4 and SOX2expressions were assessed by immunofluorescent staining.RESULTS: 32 (25%) TNBC patients with OCT4 positive expression (OCT4+), 21 (17%)patients with SOX2 positive expression (SOX2+), and 11 (9%) patients with bothOCT4+ and SOX2+ were observed. OCT4 expression was positively associated withhistologic grade (P < 0.001), pathological tumor size (P = 0.014), N stage(P < 0.001) and TNM stage (P < 0.001), while SOX2 expression was positivelycorrelated with histologic grade (P < 0.001), pathological tumor size (P = 0.033)and Ki-67 expression (P = 0.016). Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves suggested OCT4+ wascorrelated with shorter OS compared with OCT4- (P < 0.001), while no correlation between SOX2+ with OS in all patients (P = 0.128) was observed. Multivariate Cox model indicated that OCT4+ (P < 0.001) were independent factors for worse OS.CONCLUSIONS: Tumor tissue OCT4 but not SOX2 expression was positively correlated with histologic grade, pathological tumor size, N stage and TNM stage, and itcould be served as an independent biomarker to predict worse prognosis insurgical patients with TNBC.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0844-x PMID: 29536377
