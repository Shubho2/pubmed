Here, we profiled long noncoding RNAs in brain metastatic tumors frompatients with breast cancer and found that the X-inactive-specific transcript(XIST) was significantly downregulated in these tissues. XIST expression levelsinversely correlated with brain metastasis, but not with bone metastasis inpatients. Silencing of XIST preferentially promoted brain metastatic growth ofXISThigh cells in our xenograft models. Moreover, knockout of XIST in micemammary glands accelerated primary tumor growth as well as metastases in thebrain. Decreased expression of XIST stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and activated c-Met via MSN-mediated protein stabilization, which resulted in thepromotion of stemness in the tumor cells. Loss of XIST also augmented secretionof exosomal miRNA-503, which triggered M1-M2 polarization of microglia. ThisM1-M2 conversion upregulated immune suppressive cytokines in microglia thatsuppressed T-cell proliferation. Furthermore, we screened an FDA-approved druglibrary and identified fludarabine as a synthetic lethal drug for XISTlow breast tumor cells and found that fludarabine blocked brain metastasis in our animalmodel. Our results indicate that XIST plays a critical role in brain metastasisin breast cancer by affecting both tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment andthat the XIST-mediated pathway may serve as an effective target for treatingbrain metastasis.Significance: These findings describe mechanisms of how loss of the lncRNA XIST promotes brain metastasis in breast cancer and identifyfludarabine as a potential therapeutic agent that specifically eliminates XISTlowtumor cells in the brain.
