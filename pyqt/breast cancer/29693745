Recent studies have shown thatA3B is predominantly elevated in multiple cancer tissues and cell lines such asthe bladder, cervix, lung, head and neck, and breast. Upregulation and activationof A3B in developing tumors can cause an unexpected cluster of mutations whichpromote cancer development and progression. The cellular proteins whichfacilitate A3B function through direct or indirect interactions remain largelyunknown. In this study, we performed LC-MS-based proteomics to identify cellular proteins which coimmunoprecipitated with A3B. Our results indicated a specificinteraction of A3B with hnRNP A3 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein). This interaction was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and was found to beRNA-dependent. Furthermore, A3B and hnRNP A3 colocalized as evident fromimmunofluorescence analysis.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcb.26855 PMID: 29693745
