Epub2018 Mar 27.Progesterone, progestins and the endometrium in perimenopause and in menopausalhormone therapy.Gompel A(1).Author information: (1)a Unité de Gynécologie Endocrinienne , Université Paris Descartes, HôpitauxUniversitaires Port Royal-Cochin , Paris , France.It is well established that unopposed estrogen for hormone therapy inpostmenopausal women (MHT) induces a dose-related stimulation of the endometrium associated with an increased risk of hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.Progesterone acts physiologically to counteract the proliferative effects ofestradiol during the menstrual cycle. In MHT, progestogens protect theendometrium against the proliferative effects of estrogens in women with auterus. Recent data suggest that, whereas micronized progesterone is apparentlysafer for the breast, it could be less efficient than synthetic progestin on the endometrium. An update on progestogen and endometrial safety in MHT is thesubject of this review.DOI: 10.1080/13697137.2018.1446932 PMID: 29583028
