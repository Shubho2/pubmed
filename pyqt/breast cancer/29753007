Epub 2018May 9.Evaluating agreement, histological features, and relevance of separatingpleomorphic and florid lobular carcinoma in situ subtypes.Singh K(1), Paquette C(2), Kalife ET(2), Wang Y(3), Mangray S(3), Quddus MR(2),Steinhoff MM(2).Author information: (1)Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island, Department of Pathology,Providence, RI, United States. Electronic address: KSingh@wihri.org.(2)Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island, Department of Pathology,Providence, RI, United States.(3)Rhode Island Hospital, Department of Pathology, Providence, RI, United States.Morphological variants of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) include classical(CLCIS), pleomorphic (PLCIS) and florid type (FLCIS). Treatment guidelinessuggest managing PLCIS and FLCIS like ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); therefore accurate identification of LCIS subtypes is critical. However, the significanceof separating PLCIS from FLCIS is not clear. Also, interobserver agreement inidentifying LCIS subtypes, using contemporary criteria, is not known. We aimed toevaluate interobserver agreement amongst breast pathologists in diagnosing LCISsubtypes and use the agreement data to justify LCIS classification for managementpurposes. Six breast pathologists independently reviewed 50 hematoxylin andeosin-stained slides comprised of a mix of LCIS subtypes. After reviewingpublished criteria, participants diagnosed PLCIS, CLCIS and apocrine change in a marked region of interest and FLCIS based on entire section. PLCIS was identifiedin 8 to 37 slides with overall moderate agreement (Fleiss' κ = 0.565) andpairwise κ (Cohen's) ranging from -.008 to 0.492. FLCIS was diagnosed in 15-26slides with overall substantial agreement (Fleiss' κ = 0.687) and pairwise κranging from -.068 to 0.706. Both FLCIS and PLCIS coexisted in 45% of slides withconsensus on non-classical LCIS. Comedo-type necrosis (odds ratio = 5.5) andapoptosis (odds ratio = 1.8) predicted FLCIS. We found moderate and substantialagreement in diagnosing PLCIS and FLCIS respectively. Objective histologicalfeatures linked with aggressive behavior were more frequent with FLCIS. PLCIS andFLCIS patterns frequently coexist, contain similar molecular aberrations, and aremanaged similarly (like DCIS); therefore, combining FLCIS and PLCIS into onecategory (non-classical LCIS) should be considered.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.humpath.2018.04.026 PMID: 29753007
