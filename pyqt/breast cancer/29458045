Electronic address: kvramana@utmb.edu.Despite doxorubicin (Dox) being one of the most widely used chemotherapy agentsfor breast, blood and lung cancers, its use in colon cancer is limited due toincreased drug resistance and severe cardiotoxic side effects that increasemortality associated with its use at high doses. Therefore, better adjuvanttherapies are warranted to improve the chemotherapeutic efficacy and to decrease cardiotoxicity. We have recently shown that aldose reductase inhibitor,fidarestat, increases the Dox-induced colon cancer cell death and reducescardiomyopathy. However, the efficacy of fidarestat in the prevention ofDox-induced endothelial dysfunction, a pathological event critical tocardiovascular complications, is not known. Here, we have examined the effect of fidarestat on Dox-induced endothelial cell toxicity and dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. Incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with Doxsignificantly increased the endothelial cell death, and pre-treatment offidarestat prevented it. Further, fidarestat prevented the Dox-induced oxidative stress, formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of Caspase-3 inHUVECs. Fidarestat also prevented Dox-induced monocyte adhesion to HUVECs andexpression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Fidarestat pre-treatment to HUVECs restored the Dox-induced decrease in the Nitric Oxide (NO)-levels and eNOS expression.Treatment of HUVECs with Dox caused a significant increase in the activation ofNF-κB and expression of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which were prevented by fidarestat pre-treatment. Most importantly, fidarestat prevented theDox-induced mouse cardiac cell hypertrophy and expression of eNOS, iNOS, and3-Nitrotyrosine in the aorta tissues. Further, fidarestat blunted the Dox-inducedexpression of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in vivo. Thus, ourresults suggest that by preventing Dox-induced endothelial cytotoxicity anddysfunction, AR inhibitors could avert cardiotoxicity associated withanthracycline chemotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
