A plethora of research has emerged using EMRs to investigate clinicalresearch questions and assess variations in both treatments and outcomes.However, whether because of genuine complexities of modeling disease physiologyor because of practical problems regarding data capture, data accuracy, and data completeness, the state of current EMR research is challenging and gives rise to concerns regarding study accuracy and reproducibility. This work exploreschallenges in how different experimental design decisions can influence resultsusing a specific example of breast cancer patients undergoing excision andreconstruction surgeries from EMRs in an academic hospital and the VeteransHealth Administration (VHA) We discuss emerging strategies that will mitigatethese limitations, including data sharing, application of natural languageprocessing, and improved EMR user design.DOI: 10.1088/2057-1739/aaa905 PMCID: PMC5933881 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29732166
