Electronic address: v.torchilin@neu.edu.Interest in theranostic agents has continued to grow because of their promise forsimultaneous cancer detection and therapy. A platform-based nanosized combinationagent suitable for the enhanced diagnosis and treatment of cancer was preparedusing polymeric polyethylene glycol-phosphatidylethanolamine-based micellesloaded with both, poorly soluble chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel andhydrophobic superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION), a MagneticResonance Imaging contrast agent. The co-loaded paclitaxel and SPION did notaffect each other's functional properties in vitro. In vivo, the resultingpaclitaxel-SPION-co-loaded PEG-PE micelles retained their Magnetic Resonancecontrast properties and apoptotic activity in breast and melanoma tumor mousemodels. Such theranostic systems are likely to play a significant role in thecombined diagnosis and therapy that leads to a more personalized and effectiveform of treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
