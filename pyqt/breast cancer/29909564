Screening may be less effective at detecting more aggressive cancers atan earlier stage. This study was conducted to determine the relative efficacy of screening mammography to detect cancers at an earlier stage by molecularphenotype.METHODS: We identified 2882 women with primary invasive breast cancer diagnosedbetween January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2012 and who had a mammogram through theOntario Breast Screening Program in the 28 months before diagnosis. Five tumorphenotypes were defined by expression of estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR)receptors and HER2/neu oncogene. We conducted univariable and multivariableanalyses to describe the predictors of detection as an interval cancer.Additional analyses identified predictors of detection at stages II, III, or IVcompared with stage I, by phenotype. Analyses were adjusted for the effects ofage, grade, and breast density.RESULTS: ER negative and HER2 positive tumors were over-represented amonginterval cancers, and triple negative cancers were more likely than ER +/HER2 -cancers to be detected as interval cancers OR 2.5 (95% CI 2.0-3.2, p < 0.0001).Method of detection (interval vs. screen) and molecular phenotype wereindependently associated with stage at diagnosis (p < 0.0001), but there was nointeraction between method of detection and phenotype (p = 0.44).CONCLUSION: In a screened population, triple negative and HER2 + breast cancersare diagnosed at a higher stage but this appears to be due to higher growth ratesof these tumors rather than a relative inability of screening to detect them.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2687-4 PMID: 29909564
