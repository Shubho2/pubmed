In human and canine mammary cancer, the most aggressivetumors show loss of ERα expression, which in human breast cancer has beenattributed to methylation of the cytosine followed by guanine (CpG) island withinthe estrogen receptor α gene ( ESR1) promoter. This study aimed to investigatethe role of ESR1 CpG island (CGI) methylation in ERα expression in canine mammarytumors. Twenty-one canine mammary samples were sorted into three groups:malignant tumor (n = 9), benign tumor (n = 8), and normal gland (n = 4).Immunohistochemical analysis and reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCRwere performed to assess ERα expression and ESR1 mRNA levels. The methylationstatus was determined using sodium-bisulfite-treated DNA sequencing. All normalmammary glands and benign tumors showed high ERα expression (score range, 5-8).Six of the nine malignant tumors did not show ERα expression (score 0), two hadscore 2, and one had score 4. Lower ERα ( P < .005) and ESR1 mRNA levels ( P <.005) were found in malignant mammary tumors than in the other two groups. CanineESR1 has an intragenic and non-promoter-associated CGI, different from humans. Nosignificant variation in methylation percentage was observed among the groups,suggesting that ESR1 is not regulated by DNA methylation, unlike that in humans. This difference should be considered in further research using ERα as a biomarkerfor mammary tumors in canine studies on ERα-targeting therapy.DOI: 10.1177/0300985818763711 PMID: 29566609
