[Epubahead of print]Biological properties and structural study of new aminoalkyl derivatives ofbenzimidazole and benzotriazole, dual inhibitors of CK2 and PIM1 kinases.Chojnacki K(1), Wińska P(1), Wielechowska M(1), Łukowska-Chojnacka E(1), TölzerC(2), Niefind K(2), Bretner M(3).Author information: (1)Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University of Technology, Noakowskiego 3, 00-664 Warsaw, Poland.(2)Department für Chemie, Institut für Biochemie, Universtät zu Köln, ZülpicherStraße 47, D-50674 Köln, Germany.(3)Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University of Technology, Noakowskiego 3, 00-664 Warsaw, Poland. Electronic address: mbretner@ch.pw.edu.pl.The new aminoalkyl-substituted derivatives of known CK2 inhibitors4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (TBBi) and4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole (TBBt) were synthesized, and their influence on the activity of recombinant human CK2 α, CK2 holoenzyme and PIM1 kinases wasevaluated. All derivatives inhibited the activity of studied kinases and the mostefficient were aminopropyl-derivatives 8b and 14b. These compounds also exertedinhibition of cancer cell lines - CCRF-CEM (acute lymphoblastoid leukemia), MCF-7(human breast cancer), and PC-3 (prostate cancer) proliferation and their EC50 iscomparable with the value for clinically studied CK2 inhibitor CX-4945.Preliminary structure activity relationship analysis indicated that the spacerlength affected antitumor potency, and two to three methylene units were morefavorable. The complex of CK2 α1-335/8b was crystallized, both under high-saltconditions and under low-salt conditions giving crystals which diffracted X-rays to about 2.4 Å resolution, what enabled the determination of the corresponding3D-structures.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
