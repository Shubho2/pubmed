TheOncomine database was used to compare the expression of RPS15A in human breastcancer tissues and normal tissues. RPS15A in breast cancer cell line ZR-75-30 andBT474 was specifically knocked down using lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). RPS15A knockdown efficiency was validated by quantitative polymerasechain reaction and western blot analysis. Subsequently, the functional effects ofRPS15A on proliferation of breast cancer cells were investigated by MTT, colonyformation and flow cytometry assays. Functional analysis indicated that RPS15Aknockdown could inhibit cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest andapoptosis. Mechanism analysis revealed RPS15A mediated apoptosis via activatingof caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, upregulating of Bad and BAX and downregulating ofBcl-2. Our preliminary study highlighted the importance of RPS15A in breastcancer growth. The inhibition of RPS15A may be a promising therapeutic target forbreast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s10616-018-0221-9 PMID: 29802490
