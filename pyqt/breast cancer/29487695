In Hong Kong and China, genetictesting and counseling are not as common as in the West. To reduce the barrier oftesting, a multiplex SNaPshot genotyping panel that targeted 25 Chinese BRCA1/2mutation hotspots was developed, and its feasibility was evaluated in a localcohort of 441 breast and 155 ovarian cancer patients. For those who testednegative, they were then subjected to full-gene testing with next-generationsequencing (NGS). BRCA mutation prevalence in this cohort was 8.05% and the yieldof the recurrent panel was 3.52%, identifying over 40% of the mutation carriers. Moreover, from 79 Chinese breast cancer cases recruited overseas, 2 recurrentmutations and one novel BRCA2 mutation were detected by the panel and NGSrespectively. The developed genotyping panel showed to be an easy-to-perform and more affordable testing tool that can provide important contributions to improve the healthcare of Chinese women with cancer as well as family members that harborhigh risk mutations for HBOC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23471 PMCID: PMC5814262PMID: 29487695
