Cancer cells frequently exploit ahighly conserved developmental program, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), to gain migratory and invasive properties promoting their metastaticspread. Cytoplasmic localization of the oncogenic transcription and translationfactor Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) is a powerful inducer of EMT in breastcarcinoma cells. Interestingly, EMT-like processes have also been observed incutaneous melanoma despite its neural crest origin. Here, increased expression ofYB-1 negatively affects patient survival in malignant melanoma and promotesmelanoma cell tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo Intriguingly, this effect seems to be mainly mediated by cytoplasmic YB-1 that does not exhibitphosphorylation at serine-102 (S102). Moreover, S102 unphosphorylated YB-1enhances the migratory and invasive potential of human melanoma cells intwo-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) culture systems and facilitatesacquisition of a mesenchymal-like invasive phenotype in the chick embryo model.Collectively, these data demonstrate that the cytoplasmic activity of YB-1stimulates tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of melanoma cells by promotingEMT-like properties.Implications: This study reveals for the first time that YB-1efficiently drives tumorigenicity and invasiveness of melanoma cells in its S102 unphosphorylated cytoplasmic state and that YB-1 expression represents a negativeprognostic factor in primary melanoma patients.
