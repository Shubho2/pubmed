Here we report that upregulation of the lncRNA LINC00538 (YIYA) promotes glycolysis, cellproliferation and tumor growth in in breast cancer. YIYA associated with thecytosolic cyclin-dependent kinase CDK6 and regulated CDK6-dependentphosphorylation of the fructose bisphosphatase PFK2 (PFKFB3) in a cellcycle-independent manner. In breast cancer cells, these events promoted catalysisof glucose 6-phosphate to fructose-2,6-bisphosphate/fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of YIYA or CDK6 silencing impaired glycolysis andtumor growth in vivo. In clinical specimens of breast cancer, YIYA was expressed in ~40% of cases where it correlated with CDK6 expression and unfavorablesurvival outcomes. Our results define a functional role for lncRNA in metabolicreprogramming in cancer, with potential clinical implications for its therapeutictargeting.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0385 PMID: 29967256
