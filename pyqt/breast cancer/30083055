The aim of this study was is to explore the expression of several biomarkers described during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)and the achievement of pCR in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Weidentified archived pathology tissue from patients with breast cancer whoreceived NAC during the year 2014. We performed immunohistochemical analysis ofvimentin, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),E-cadherin, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and Her2neu andstudied the association between the expression of these markers and pCR. A Fisherexact test for categorical cofactors, an unpaired t test and a nonparametricWilcoxon test for continuous cofactors were used. The results showed asignificant expression of vimentin in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC;P = .023). An inverse correlation between vimentin and the ER expression(P = .032) was observed. No significant association was noted for vimentin,NF-κB, EGFR, and E-cadherin was associated with pCR. This study suggests that theevaluated EMT related biomarkers are not associated with pCR after NACchemotherapy in an unselected breast cancer population. Vimentin and NF-κBexpressions were associated with TNBC and could be further explored as potential therapeutic targets in this subgroup. A prevalence of vimentin and NF-κB amongHispanic patients with breast cancer warrants further investigation as a possiblycontributing to the prevalence of TNBC and adverse prognosis in this population.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418788074 PMCID: PMC6071152PMID: 30083055
