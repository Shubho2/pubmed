Electronic address: altamirano@itesm.mx.Patients with breast cancer (BC) overexpressing HER2 (HER2+) are selected forTrastuzumab treatment, which blocks HER2 and improves cancer prognosis. However, HER2+ diagnosis, by the gold standard, immunohistochemistry, could lead toerrors, associated to: a) variability in sample manipulation (thin 2D sections), b) use of subjective algorithms, and c) heterogeneity of HER2 expression withinthe tissue. Therefore, we explored HER2 3D detection by multiplexed imaging ofAffibody-Quantum Dots conjugates (Aff-QD), ratiometric analysis (RMAFI) andthresholding, using BC multicellular tumor spheroids (BC-MTS) (~120 μm ofdiameter) as 3D model of BC. HER2+, HER2- and hybrid HER2+/- BC-MTS (mimickingheterogeneous tissue) were incubated simultaneously with two Aff-QD probes(anti-HER2 and negative control (NC), respectively, (1:1)). Confocal XY sections were recorded along the Z distance, and processed by automatized RMAFI (anti-HER2Aff-QD/ NC). Quantifying the NC fluorescence allowed to predict the fraction ofnon-specific accumulation of the anti-HER2 probe within the thick sample, andresolve the specific HER2 level. HER2 was detected up to 30μm within intactBC-MTS, however, permeabilization improved detection up to 70μm. Specific HER2signal was objectively quantified, and HER2 3D-density of 9.2, 48.3 and 30.8%were obtained in HER2-, HER2+ and hybrid HER2+/- permeabilized BC-MTS,respectively. Therefore, by combining the multiplexing capacity of Aff-QD probes and RMAFI, we overcame the challenge of non-specific probe accumulation in 3Dsamples with minimal processing, yielding a fast, specific spatial HER2 detectionand objective quantification.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
