Previous concordance studies of BC grade have reported moderatelevels of agreement; a typical finding in morphological assessment of biological variables. This study aims at investigating the impact of discordance on theprognostic value of grade and identifying the best reporting approach inborderline cases.METHODS: A large (n=1675) well-characterised annotated cohort of BC originallygraded in routine practice using glass slides was re-graded twice, by an expertbreast pathologist using virtual microscopy with a three months washout period.Outcome was assessed using breast cancer specific and distant metastasis freesurvival (median follow-up =135 months).RESULTS: 58% of the cases showed absolute agreement in the three separate gradingsessions whereas grade 1/2 and grade 2/3 discordance were observed in 21% and 21%respectively. Absolute intra-observer agreement using virtual microscopy wasobserved in 77% of the cases whereas 13% and 10% showed grade 1/2 and grade 2/3discordance respectively. Despite the concordance, outcome analysis revealedsignificant associations between tumour grade and patients' outcome in the three grading sessions. Grade 1/2 and grade 2/3 discordant cases showed intermediatesurvival between grade 1 and grade 2 tumours and grade 2 and grade 3 tumours,respectively. Grade 1/2 discordant cases showed a worse outcome when comparedwith grade 1 tumours (p=0.008) but no statistical difference was identified when compared with grade 2 tumours. Similarly, grade 2/3 discordant cases showed asignificant difference from grade 2 tumours (p<0.001) but no statisticaldifference was identified when compared with grade 3 tumours.CONCLUSIONS: BC grade discordance is likely a reflection of biologically, andhence morphologically, borderline tumours. Cases with borderline features forgrade are more likely to behave similar to the higher grade category. Repeatinghistological grade of borderline cases or double reporting may improvecorrelation with outcome. This article is protected by copyright.
