This study analyzed themicroarray gene expression data of 288 samples from 170 women in the NormalBreast Study (NBS), wherein multiple histologically normal breast samples werecollected from different block regions and different sections at a given region. Intra-individual differences in global gene expression and selected geneexpression signatures were quantified and evaluated in association with otherpatient-level factors. We found that intra-individual reliability was relatively high in global gene expression, but differed by signatures, withcomposition-related signatures (i.e., stroma) having higher intra-individualvariability and tumorigenesis-related signatures (i.e., proliferation) havinglower intra-individual variability. Histological stroma composition was the only factor significantly associated with heterogeneous breast tissue (definedas > median intra-individual variation; high nuclear density, odds ratio[OR] = 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-10.15; low area, OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.10-0.86). Other factors suggestively influencing the variability included age, BMI, and adipose nuclear density. Our results underscore the importance ofconsidering intra-individual variability in tissue-based biomarker development,and have important implications for normal breast research.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27505-y PMCID: PMC6002361PMID: 29904148
