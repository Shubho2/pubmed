More than half of patients with breast cancer will develop hepatic metastases; this portends a poorer prognosis. In the appropriately selected patient, there does appear to be a role for curative(surgery, ablation) or palliative (intra-arterial treatments) locoregionaltherapy. Gynecologic malignancies are less common and metastases to the liver aremost often seen in the setting of disseminated disease. The role of locoregional therapies in these patients is not well reported. The purpose of this article is to review the outcomes data of locoregional therapies in the treatment of hepaticmetastases from breast and gynecologic malignancies.DOI: 10.1055/s-0038-1636518 PMCID: PMC5886768 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29628613
