Our objective was toevaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a screener in community-basedoncology clinics.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were from two rural, underservedcommunity-based cancer clinics; within 12 months of a cancer diagnosis (breast,lung, colorectal, pancreas, esophageal); aged ≥60 years; and not exclusivelypursuing palliative care. We used a previously validated tool that was embeddedin the electronic health record (EHR). Patient-reported responses identifiedmemory impairment, depressive symptoms, deficits in activities of daily living,poor nutrition, and polypharmacy. At the discretion of the oncologist, responses prompted service referrals. From the EHR, we extracted information aboutreferrals and completion of planned therapy. We present descriptive statistics.RESULTS: Enrolled patients (n = 44) had a mean age of 71.5 years (SD = 6.9). Mostwere non-white (61%), women (66%), with government-sponsored health insurance(80%). The most commonly identified geriatric syndromes: polypharmacy (89%),reduced quality of life (39%), and poor nutrition (39%). The screener triggered areferral in 98% of patients. Generated referrals were for depressive symptoms(52% needed, 39% received), nutrition (43% needed, 37% received), andpolypharmacy (89% needed, 26% received). Patients were referred to social work(56%), nutrition (44%), and pharmacy (25%). Many patients completed plannedradiation therapy (100%), surgery (70%), and chemotherapy (60%).CONCLUSIONS: Use of an EHR-embedded brief geriatric oncology assessment in rural oncology clinics identified geriatric syndromes that would benefit from provisionof services in nearly all enrolled patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02906592.Published by Elsevier Ltd.DOI: 10.1016/j.jgo.2018.06.004 PMID: 29958815
