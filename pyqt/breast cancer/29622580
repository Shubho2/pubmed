IFN-I acts directly on tumor cells to inhibit cell growth and indirectly by activating immune cellsto mount antitumor responses. To understand the role of endogenous IFN-I inspontaneous, oncogene-driven carcinogenesis, we characterized tumors arising inHER2/neu transgenic (neuT) mice carrying a nonfunctional mutation in the IFNIreceptor (IFNAR1). Such mice are unresponsive to this family of cytokines.Compared with parental neu+/- mice (neuT mice), IFNAR1-/- neu+/- mice (IFNAR-neuTmice) showed earlier onset and increased tumor multiplicity with markedvascularization. IFNAR-neuT tumors exhibited deregulation of genes having adverseprognostic value in breast cancer patients, including the breast cancer stem cell(BCSC) marker aldehyde dehydrogenase-1A1 (ALDH1A1). An increased number of BCSCs were observed in IFNAR-neuT tumors, as assessed by ALDH1A1 enzymatic activity,clonogenic assay, and tumorigenic capacity. In vitro exposure of neuT+mammospheres and cell lines to antibodies to IFN-I resulted in increasedfrequency of ALDH+ cells, suggesting that IFN-I controls stemness in tumor cells.Altogether, these results reveal a role of IFN-I in neuT-driven spontaneouscarcinogenesis through intrinsic control of BCSCs.
