Despite the availability of diagnostics, delays intreatment are still quite common. The aim of this work is to analyze the reasons for delayed diagnostics and treatment, in patients with neurological deficits in the course of metastatic spine disease.METHODS: In our study patients medical data was analyzed from 2013 to 2015. Theanalysis covered the following aspects: symptoms of metastases, time ofneurological deficits occurrence, where and when initial diagnostics wereperformed, time from diagnosis to proper surgical treatment in an oncologicalcentre. In total, 411 patients were consulted and 287 were operated on. Of 112patients with neurological deficits, 64 underwent surgeries. Women representedthe majority of the patients. The most common primary neoplasms were breastcancer and myeloma.RESULTS: In 75% of the patients neurological symptoms occurred prior to admissionto a hospital. The average time between the onset of neurological symptoms andmedical consultation was 4 days. The patients were diagnosed mainly atneurologic, orthopedic and emergency departments. The mean time betweenundergoing radiological examinations and receiving the examinations results was2.4 days for CT and 2.8 days for MRI. The average time between a patients'admission from the department where they were initially diagnosed, to theorthopedic oncology ward was 4.5 days.CONCLUSIONS: The most common cause of the delayed treatment of patients withneurological deficits, in the course of metastatic spine disease, is acombination of the lack of knowledge among patients and healthcare personnelregarding the necessity of early diagnosis.DOI: 10.1186/s12904-018-0295-3 PMCID: PMC5842651PMID: 29514666
