The number of cancer survivors is increasing worldwideand little is known about long-term diet changes in people who had cancer. Westudied 53,981 women from the prospective E3N-EPIC cohort study with availabledietary data in 1993 and 2005, among whom 4,619 had a cancer diagnosis inbetween (including n = 2,699 breast cancers). We evaluated the potential impact of acancer diagnosis (comparing women with cancer to women with no cancer) on changesin FV consumption using multivariable linear regression models considering cancersite, stage at diagnosis and socioeconomic factors. Compared to women with nocancer, a statistically significant increase in FV consumption (β=+2.65%,[1.22-4.09]) was observed in women who had cancer, and this association appeared to be driven by breast cancer exclusively. The increase in FV consumption waslarger in women who had an advanced stage of breast cancer (stages II-IV)(β=+7.23%, [3.92-10.5]) than in women with stages 0-I (β=+2.03%, [-0.20 to4.26]). Women with no partner and no children were those having the highestincrease in FV consumption (β=+18.71%, [6.51-30.91]). These changes were onlyobserved in specific SE groups. When considering adherence to guidelines, theproportion of women who consumed less than 7.5 portions a day in 1993 and more in2005 was greater in women with advanced breast cancer. More research is nowneeded to understand how the inequities we observed impact the long-term healthafter cancer.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31572 PMID: 29717489
