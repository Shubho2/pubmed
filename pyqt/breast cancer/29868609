Recent efforts have focused on preventing cancer cell proliferation associated with glutamine addiction by targeting glutaminase using the inhibitor BPTES (bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethylsulfide). In the current study, an investigation of the BPTES induced changes in metabolism was made in two human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 (an estrogenreceptor dependent cell line) and MDA-MB231 (a triple negative cell line),relative to the non-cancerous cell line, MCF10A. NMR spectroscopy combined with arecently established smart-isotope tagging approach enabled quantitative analysisof 41 unique metabolites representing numerous metabolite classes includingcarbohydrates, amino acids, carboxylic acids and nucleotides. BPTES inducedmetabolism changes in the cancer cell lines were especially pronounced underhypoxic conditions with up to 1/3 of the metabolites altered significantly (p <0.05) relative to untreated cells. The BPTES induced changes were more pronouncedfor MCF7 cells, with 14 metabolites altered significantly (p < 0.05) compared to seven for MDA-MB231. Analyses of the results indicate that BPTES affectednumerous metabolic pathways including glycolysis, TCA cycle, nucleotide and aminoacid metabolism in cancer. The distinct metabolic responses to BPTES treatmentdetermined in the two breast cancer cell lines offer valuable metabolicinformation for the exploration of the therapeutic responses to breast cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fmolb.2018.00049 PMCID: PMC5962734PMID: 29868609
