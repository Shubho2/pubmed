The aim of this study is totranslate and culturally adapt a Turkish version and investigate the validity andreliability of the CFS in Turkish patients with fatigue symptoms. Materials andmethods: Eighty participants completed the Turkish version of the CFS for breast cancer and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Qualityof Life Core Questionnaire ″Core 30″ (EORTC QLQ-C30). Test-retest reliability wasevaluated by repeating the CFS with a 7-day interval. Results: The CFSdemonstrated high test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.95) and good internalconsistency (Cronbach′s alpha = 0.74) for all domains. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkinmeasure of sampling adequacy was found to be 0.819, which is considered to besatisfactory (>0.5). Correlations between domains of CFS physical and EORTCphysical (r: 0.77), CFS cognitive and EORTC cognitive (r: 0.70), and CFS physicaland EORTC fatigue (r: 0.80) were found to be significant. Conclusion: The Turkishversion of the CFS is a reliable and valid instrument to assess physical,effective, and cognitive dimensions of fatigue. The CFS may be used to evaluatethe severity of fatigue in Turkish-speaking breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.3906/sag-1707-125 PMID: 29479970
