Insilico tools are reliable when assessing variants located in consensus splicesites, but we may identify variants in complex genomic contexts for whichbioinformatics is not precise enough. In this study, we characterize BRCA2c.7976 + 5G > T variant located in intron 17 which has an atypical donor site(GC). This variant was identified in three unrelated Spanish families and we havedetected exon 17 skipping as the predominant transcript occurring in carriers. Wehave also detected several isoforms (Δ16-18, Δ17,18, Δ18, and ▼17q224 ) atdifferent expression levels among carriers and controls. This study remarks thechallenge of interpreting genetic variants when multiple alternative isoforms arepresent, and that caution must be taken when using in silico tools to identifypotential spliceogenic variants located in GC-AG introns.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/humu.23583 PMID: 29969168
