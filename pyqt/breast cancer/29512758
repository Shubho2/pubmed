China.Breast cancer suppressor candidate-1 (BCSC-1; also termed von Willebrand factor Adomain containing 5A and LOH11CR2A) is a newly identified candidate tumorsuppressor gene that has been implicated in several types of cancer in previousstudies. However, there have been few reports about the association betweenBCSC-1 and human breast cancer in recent years. In the present study, theexpression of BCSC-1 in breast cancer was determined byimmunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tissue microarrays and clinical tissuespecimens. Subsequently, BCSC-1 gene expression was evaluated in different breastcancer cell lines by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the MDA-MB-231cell line was selected for further use in subsequent experiments, due to its low BCSC-1 expression. An MDA-MB-231 cell line with stable overexpression of BCSC-1was established through transfection with plasmid containing the BCSC-1 gene, andthen screening for G418 resistance. Wound-healing, migration and invasion assays were conducted to detect the effect of BCSC-1 on MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore,changes in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), osteopontin (OPN) and the nuclearfactor-κB (NF-κB) pathway were detected in the current study. Additionally,stable silencing of BCSC-1 expression in MCF-7 cells was performed using alentivirus. The results of IHC indicated that BCSC-1 is expressed at low levelsin breast cancer tissues compared with in normal breast tissue. Results of thewound healing, migration and invasion assays demonstrated that BCSC-1overexpression reduced the metastasis ability of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro.Further research confirmed that the BCSC-1 overexpression reduced the expression levels of MMP7, MMP9 and OPN, and the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65. Furthermore, inhibition of BCSC-1 via lentivirus-mediated RNA interference revealed that thedownregulation of BCSC-1 increased the invasive ability of MCF-7 cells. Insummary, the results demonstrated that BCSC-1 is expressed at low levels inbreast cancer tissues, and that it can suppress human breast cancer cellmigration and invasion, potentially altering the expression of MMP7, MMP9, OPN,and the activity of the NF-κB pathway. Therefore, BCSC-1 may be useful as abiomarker for the treatment of breast cancer in the future.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4309 PMID: 29512758
