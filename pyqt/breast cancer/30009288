Such pH-responsive nanoparticles are non-toxic against a panelof human breast cancer cell lines, but demonstrated comparable toxicities to freedoxorubicin when loaded with doxorubicin. Significantly, comparable efficacy tofree doxorubicin was observed even against triple negative breast cancer cells,highlighting the potential of the materials generated as drug delivery vehiclesfor cancer treatment. Facile block copolymer deprotection resulted in a polymerthat presents an altered self-assembly/disassembly profile; forming nanoparticleswhen stored in either acidic or alkaline solution, but undergoingself-disassembly when added to aqueous solution of pH 7.4. This second polymerhighlights the considerable versatility that poly(α-hydroxy acids) inherentlypossess.DOI: 10.1039/c8nr03897j PMID: 30009288
