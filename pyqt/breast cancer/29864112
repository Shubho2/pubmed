Handgripstrength in kilogram (kg) was defined as the maximum value achieved using either hand. Two cognitive function tests were conducted among adults 60 years andolder. The Animal Fluency Test (AFT) examines categorical verbal fluency (acomponent of executive function), and the Digital Symbol Substitution test (DSST)assesses processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory. Surveyanalysis procedures were used to account for the complex sampling design of theNHANES. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate associations ofhandgrip strength with cognitive test scores, adjusting for confounders (age,gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking status, depressivesymptoms and leisure time physical activity).RESULTS: Among 383 cancer survivors (58.5% women, mean age = 70.9 years, mean BMI= 29.3 kg/m2), prevalent cancer types were breast (22.9%), prostate (16.4%),colon (6.9%) and cervix (6.2%). In women, each increase in kg of handgripstrength was associated with 0.20 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.33) higher score on AFT and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.30 to 1.35) higher score on DSST. In men, we observed an invertedU-shape association where cognitive function peaked at handgrip strength of 40-42kg.CONCLUSIONS: Handgrip strength, a modifiable factor, appears to be associatedwith aspects of cognitive functions in cancer survivors. Prospective studies are needed to address their causal relationship.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197909 PMCID: PMC5986134PMID: 29864112
