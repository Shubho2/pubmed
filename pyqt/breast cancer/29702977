ER-α PvuII gene polymorphism is in close association with the occurrence risk of breast cancer, but no consensus has been achieved currently.METHODS: PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database,Wanfang database, and VIP database were retrieved to collect the case-controlstudies on association between ERα gene Pvu II polymorphism and breast cancerrisk published before September 1, 2017. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used toassess the quality of the literatures, Stata 14.0 software was applied formeta-analysis, and the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated. The subgroup analysis was performed to assess theconfounding factors, followed by assessment of publication bias and sensitivityanalysis.RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were enrolled in the analysis based on inclusioncriteria, which included 15,360 patients and 26,423 controls. The resultsdemonstrated that ERα gene Pvu II polymorphism was in significant associationwith the decrease of breast cancer risk in 3 genetic models (C vs T, OR = 0.962, 95% CI = 0.933-0.992, P = .012; CC vs TT, OR = 0.911, 95% CI = 0.856-0.969,P = .003; CC vs TT/CT, OR = 0.923, 95% CI = 0.874-0.975, P = .004). Subgroupanalysis was conducted on the basis of ethnicity and source of controls, whoseresults illustrated that ERα gene Pvu II polymorphism was in significantassociation with the decrease of breast cancer risk in Asians rather than inCaucasians (CC vs TT, OR = 0.862, 95% CI = 0.750-0.922, P = .038; CC vs TT/CT,OR = 0.851, 95% CI = 0.755-0.959, P = .008). In population-based subgroup rather than in hospital-based subgroup, ERα gene Pvu II polymorphism was in significant association with the decrease of breast cancer risk in the allele model,homozygous model, dominant model, and recessive model (C vs T, OR = 0.943, 95%CI = 0.911-0.977, P = .001; CC vs TT, OR = 0.878, 95% CI = 0.817-0.944, P = .000;CC/CT vs TT, OR = 0.936, 95% CI = 0.881-0.994, P = .031; CC vs TT/CT, OR = 0.902,95% CI = 0.847-0.960, P = .001).CONCLUSION: ERα gene Pvu II polymorphism exerts an important function in theprogression of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010317 PMCID: PMC5944501PMID: 29702977  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
