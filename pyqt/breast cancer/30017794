Electronic address:ben.calhoun@unc.edu.BACKGROUND: The long-term risk for patients with benign intraductal papillomas(IDPs) on core needle biopsy (CNB) who are not upgraded on excision is notwell-defined. The goal of this study was to determine the cumulative breastcancer (BC) incidence for patients with benign IDP on CNB.MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were 152 benign IDPs diagnosed on CNB between 2003and 2008. Radiology and pathology data were reviewed by breast radiologists andpathologists. Clinical follow-up was obtained from the electronic medical record (Epic).RESULTS: Excision results were: 96 (63%) not upgraded, 9 (6%) with BC on excision(6 ductal carcinoma in situ, 3 invasive carcinoma), and 5 (3%) lacked correlationwith the CNB site. Excision reports were unavailable for 42 (28%). Excludingcases with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 5 or discordantimaging, there were 6 (4%) true upgrades (all ductal carcinoma in situ). Afterthe exclusion of patients with other major risk factors, follow-up was available for 55 of 58 patients with benign IDPs, and 8 (14%) developed BC after a medianof 112 months (range, 11-159 months). None of the benign IDP patients without an excision report developed BC after a median of 97 months (range, 5-164 months).CONCLUSIONS: The upgrade rate for benign IDP diagnosed on CNB was 4%, similar to recent studies. The cumulative BC incidence for those who were not upgraded andwho had no history of BC was 14% at a median of 9 years. When combined withpatients without an excision pathology report, the overall BC incidence was 9%.The findings support continued breast cancer surveillance in this patientpopulation.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
