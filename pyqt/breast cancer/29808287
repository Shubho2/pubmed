We examined the rates of BRCA testing and RRBM from1997 to 2016, and quantified trends before and after the Jolie op-ed.METHODS: This observational study of insurance claims data representative of the commercially-insured US population (Truven MarketScan® database) measured BRCAtesting and RRBM rates among females ≥ 18 years. Censoring events were breastcancer or ovarian cancer diagnosis, last follow-up date (September 2016), ordeath. Interrupted time series analyses were used to quantify trends before andafter the op-ed.RESULTS: Angelina Jolie's NYT op-ed led to a statistically significant increasein the uptake of genetic testing and in RRBM among women without previousdiagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer in the US population, and in women who did not undergo testing for BRCA (P < 0.0001 for both). The rate (slope) of RRBMamong women who were previously tested for BRCA (P = 0.70) was unchanged. Afterexcluding women with in-situ tumors, the editorial's effect became lesspronounced, suggesting that high-risk women with in-situ breast cancers were mostinfluenced by Jolie's announcement.CONCLUSION: The Angelina Effect-a term coined by Time magazine to describe therise in internet searches related to breast cancer genetics andcounseling-represents a long-lasting impact of celebrity on public healthawareness as significant increases in genetic testing and mastectomy rates wereobserved and sustained in subsequent years.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4824-9 PMID: 29808287
