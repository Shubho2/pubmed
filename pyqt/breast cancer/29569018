We investigatedwhether lack of guideline-recommended therapy contributed to survival differencesoverall and among Hispanics relative to non-Hispanic white (NHW) women in acase-cohort study.METHODS: The study included a 15% random sample of female invasive breast cancer patients diagnosed from 1997 to 2009 in 6 New Mexico counties and all deaths due to breast cancer-related causes. Information was obtained from comprehensivemedical chart reviews. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN®)guideline-recommended treatment was assessed among white women aged < 70 who werefree of contraindications for recommended therapy, had stage I-III tumors, andsurvived ≥ 12 months. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for breast cancer death were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: Included women represented 4635 patients and 449 breast cancer deaths.Women who did not receive radiotherapy (HR 2.3; 95% CI 1.2-4.4) or endocrinetherapy (HR 2.0; 95% CI 1.0-4.0) as recommended by guidelines had an increasedrisk of breast cancer death, relative to those treated appropriately. Receipt of guideline-recommended therapy did not differ between Hispanic and NHW women forchemotherapy (84.2% vs. 81.3%, respectively), radiotherapy (89.2% vs. 91.1%), or endocrine therapy (89.2% vs. 85.8%), thus did not influence Hispanic survivaldisparities.CONCLUSIONS: Lack of guideline-recommended radiotherapy or endocrine therapycontributed to survival as strongly as other established prognostic indicators.Hispanic survival disparities in this population do not appear to be attributableto treatment differences.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4761-7 PMCID: PMC6002943 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29569018
