Longnon-coding RNA (lncRNA) breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance 4 (BCAR4) has beenproved to promote proliferation and metastasis in multiple tumors. However, thefunction and significance of BCAR4 in cervical cancer are still unclear.METHODS: In this study, we concentrated on the biological function and clinicalsignificance of BCAR4 in cervical cancer. More specifically, BCAR4 expression wasevaluated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines by qRT-PCR. Moreover, theprognostic factors were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportionalhazards models. Additionally, functional assays were conducted and the potential mechanism was explored.RESULTS: Our study showed that BCAR4 expression was significantly up-regulated incervical cancer tissue and cell lines. Moreover, patients with high BCAR4expression showed worse survival outcomes and overexpression of BCAR4 might be anindependent prognostic factor in cervical cancer. Furthermore, overexpression of BCAR4 remarkably promoted the proliferation, motility of cervical cancer cellsand silencing BCAR4 significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration andinvasion of cervical cancer cells. Additionally, overexpression of BCAR4 promotedepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and silencing BCAR4 suppressedEMT process in cervical cancer cells.CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that BCAR4 might play a crucial role incervical cancer progression and act as an underlying biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of cervical cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
