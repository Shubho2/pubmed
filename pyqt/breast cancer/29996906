However, blockage of estrogen production oraction prevents development of and suppresses progression of ER-negative breastcancers. How estrogen promotes ER-negative breast cancer development andprogression is poorly understood. We previously discovered that deletion of cell cycle inhibitors p16Ink4a (p16) or p18Ink4c (p18) is required for development of Brca1-deficient basal-like mammary tumors, and that mice lacking p18 developluminal-type mammary tumors.METHODS: A genetic model system with three mouse strains, one that developsER-positive mammary tumors (p18 single deletion) and the others that developER-negative tumors (p16;Brca1 and p18;Brca1 compound deletion), human BRCA1mutant breast cancer patient-derived xenografts, and human BRCA1-deficient andBRCA1-proficient breast cancer cells were used to determine the role of estrogen in activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stimulating cellproliferation, and promoting ER-negative mammary tumor initiation and metastasis.RESULTS: Estrogen stimulated the proliferation and tumor-initiating potential of both ER-positive Brca1-proficient and ER-negative Brca1-deficient tumor cells.Estrogen activated EMT in a subset of Brca1-deficient mammary tumor cells thatmaintained epithelial features, and enhanced the number of cancer stem cells,promoting tumor progression and metastasis. Estrogen activated EMT independent ofER in Brca1-deficient, but not Brca1-proficient, tumor cells. Estrogen activated the AKT pathway in BRCA1-deficient tumor cells independent of ER, andpharmaceutical inhibition of AKT activity suppressed EMT and cell proliferationpreventing BRCA1 deficient tumor progression.CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals for the first time that estrogen promotesBRCA1-deficient tumor initiation and progression by stimulation of cellproliferation and activation of EMT, which are dependent on AKT activation andindependent of ER.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0996-9 PMCID: PMC6042319PMID: 29996906
