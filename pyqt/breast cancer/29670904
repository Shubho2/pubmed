Here, to further explore the complex dialog between MSCs and tumor cells, umbilical cord-derivedmesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) were employed to be cocultured with eitherbreast or ovarian cancer cells. Though having no obvious influence onproliferation or apoptosis, UC-MSCs exerted intense stem cell-like propertiespromoting effects on both cancer models. Cocultured cancer cells showed enriched side population, enhanced sphere formation ability, and upregulatedpluripotency-associated stem cell markers. Human cytokine array and real-time PCRrevealed a panel of MSC-derived prostemness cytokines CCL2, CXCL1, IL-8, and IL-6which were induced upon coculturing. We further revealed IL-1β, awell-characterized proinflammatory cytokine, to be the inducer of theseprostemness cytokines, which was generated from inflammatory UC-MSCs in anautocrine manner. Additionally, with introduction of IL-1RA (an IL-1 receptorantagonist) into the coculturing system, the stem cell-like characteristicspromoting effects of inflammatory UC-MSCs were partially blocked. Taken together,these findings suggest that transduced inflammatory MSCs work as a major sourceof IL-1β in tumor microenvironment and initiate the formation of prostemnessniche via regulating their secretome in an IL-1β-dependent manner.DOI: 10.1155/2018/7096707 PMCID: PMC5835289PMID: 29670904
