Moreover, different tracer methods havevarious advantages and disadvantages. In recent years, carbon nanoparticlesuspensions (CNSs) have been used as lymph node tracers during surgeries forthyroid cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer. The study retrospectively analyzed the feasibility and accuracy of CNS for sentinel lymph node (SLN)mapping in patients with early breast cancer.METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study included breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017, in the Department of Breast Cancer, Guangdong General Hospital. All patients received standard SLNBsurgery using a CNS tracer.RESULTS: A total of 332 cases were included in this study. The SLN identificationrate was 99.1% (329/332), and the mean number of SLNs was 2.6 (range, 1-6). SLNmetastasis was found in 62 (18.8%) cases, of which 90.3% were found to bemacrometastases. The sensitivity of SLNB was 95.9% (47/49), with a specificity of100% (42/42), a positive predictive value of 100% (47/47), a negative predictive value of 95.5% (42/44), and a false-negative rate of 4.1% (2/49).CONCLUSION: The identification and predictive values of a CNS tracer for SLNBwere satisfactory.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1414-6 PMCID: PMC6006710PMID: 29914538
