China.The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased the past few decades, the mostfrequent type has been identified to be the papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).Following thyroidectomy, radioiodine ablation treatment on PTC is routinelyperformed. However, many patients do not benefit from radioiodine therapy.Therefore, novel targeted therapies to suppress tumor growth and improveradioiodine uptake are required. La ribonucleoprotein domain family member(LARP)7 is a member of the LARP family and functions as a potential suppressor ofthe progression of carcinoma. In the present study, the expression status ofLARP7 in PTC tissues and cell lines was investigated, and the cell viability,proliferation and apoptotic rate, radioiodine uptake ability of PTC cells withoverexpression of LARP7 in vitro was determined. Expression levels of LARP7 were significantly downregulated in PTC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression ofLARP7 inhibited the proliferation and increased the radioiodine uptake ability ofPTC cells in vitro and inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, LARP7overexpression inhibited the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway and increasedsodium/iodide symporter (NIS) expression. However, treatment with recombinanthuman SHH partially reduced radioiodine uptake ability and NIS expression inducedby LARP7. In conclusion, LARP7 may act as a tumor suppressor in PTC by inhibitingthe SHH signaling pathway and may be a promising therapeutic target in patientswith PTC.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8856 PMCID: PMC5983951PMID: 29620212
