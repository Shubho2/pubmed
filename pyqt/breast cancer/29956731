China.Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality among women with cancer worldwide. Quercetin‑3‑methyl ether, a natural compound occurring in various plants, hasbeen indicated to have potent anticancer activity. Breast cancer cell growth and survival were examined by CCK‑8 and colony formation assay, whilst cell cycle andapoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. Cell invasion and migration wereassessed by wound‑healing assay and Transwell assay. Cancer stem cell formationwas analyzed by mammosphere formation assay and related signaling pathways weredetected by western blotting. In the present study, it was observed thattreatment with quercetin‑3‑methyl ether significantly inhibited cell growth,induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G2‑M phase, and suppressedinvasion and migration in human breast cancer cells, including the triplenegative MDAMB‑231 cell line, and the estrogen receptor‑positive/progesteronereceptor‑positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2‑negative MCF‑7 andT47D cell lines. This compound also markedly suppressed theepithelial‑mesenchymal transition process as evidenced by the upregulatedexpression of E‑cadherin, and the concomitant downregulated expression ofvimentin and MMP‑2. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that quercetin‑3‑methylether treatment inhibited mammosphere formation and the expression of thestemness‑related genes, SRY‑box 2 and Nanog. Mechanistically, this compounddecreased the expression of Notch1, and induced the phosphorylation ofphosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K) and Akt. It also attenuated the human insulingrowth factor 1‑induced phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt and glycogen synthasekinase β. Additionally, the combination of quercetin‑3‑methyl ether and asecretase inhibitor (DAPT) exhibited additive suppression of the expression ofNotch1, PI3K, Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin and a more marked inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and colony formation compared with either drugalone. Treatment with quercetin‑3‑methyl ether alone markedly suppressed thelevels of tri‑methyl histone H3 (Lys27), but had no effect on the expression ofenhancer of zeste homolog 2. Overall, these findings indicated thatquercein‑3‑methyl ether may be a potential therapeutic compound for the treatmentof triple negative and hormone‑sensitive breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3741 PMID: 29956731
