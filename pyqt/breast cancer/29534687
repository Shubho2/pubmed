In addition to patient and tumorcharacteristics, data on immobilization, image guidance and motion management as well as dose prescription and fractionation has been gathered. Besides doseresponse and survival statistics, time trends of the aforementioned variableshave been investigated.RESULTS: In total, 474 patients with 623 liver oligometastases (median 1lesion/patient; range 1–4) have been collected from 1997 until 2015. Predominant histologies were colorectal cancer (n = 213 pts.; 300 lesions) and breast cancer (n = 57; 81 lesions). All centers employed an SBRT specific setup. Initially,stereotactic coordinates and CT simulation were used for treatment set-up (55%), but eventually were replaced by CBCT guidance (28%) or more recently robotictracking (17%). High variance in fraction (fx) number (median 1 fx; range 1–13)and dose per fraction (median: 18.5 Gy; range 3–37.5 Gy) was observed, althoughmedian BED remained consistently high after an initial learning curve. Medianfollow-up time was 15 months; median overall survival after SBRT was 24 months.One- and 2-year treated metastases control rate of treated lesions was 77% and64%; if maximum isocenter biological equivalent dose (BED) was greater than 150Gy EQD2Gy, it increased to 83% and 70%, respectively. Besides radiation dosecolorectal and breast histology and motion management methods were associatedwith improved treated metastases control.CONCLUSION: After an initial learning curve with regards to total cumulativedoses, consistently high biologically effective doses have been employedtranslating into high local tumor control at 1 and 2 years. The true impact ofhistology and motion management method on treated metastases control deservedeeper analysis. Overall survival is mainly influenced by histology andmetastatic tumor burden.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4191-2 PMCID: PMC5851117PMID: 29534687
