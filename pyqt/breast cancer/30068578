Breast imagingrevealed a large suspicious mass associated with cystic components. Core biopsyhowever was non-diagnostic and only revealed necrotic papillary tissue. Thepatient then underwent excision of the lesion that revealed a large area ofintracystic papillary ductal carcinoma in situ with a focus of micropapillaryvariant of mucinous cancer. This case describes how this rare subtype couldpresent as necrotic papillary tissue on core biopsy, resulting in a diagnosticdilemma, which had not been previously reported. A literature review of this raresubtype was performed too.Â© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2018. No commercial re-use. See rights andpermissions.
