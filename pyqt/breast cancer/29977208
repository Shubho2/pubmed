Trimebutine is one of the prokinetic agents and it has been mainly used for treatment of disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract such asirritable bowel syndrome. However, its effects on glioma cells remain unknown.Here, we used various concentrations of trimebutine to treat SHG44, U251, andU-87 MG human glioma/glioblastoma cells. And combined experiments of MTT, colony formation assay, and wound healing assay, as well as western blot andimmunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate the effects of trimebutine onglioma cells. The results demonstrated that trimebutine significantly inhibitedcell viability and colony formation. A significant inhibition of glioma cellmigration was also indicated by wound healing assay. In addition, trimebutinepromoted cell apoptosis and induced Bcl-2 downregulation, accompanied with Baxupregulation. Both immunofluorescence staining and western blot results showedthat trimebutine increased the level of active Caspase-3. Moreover, trimebutinereduced the activation of both AKT and ERK signaling pathways. In subcutaneousU-87 MG cell xenograft tumors in nude mice, trimebutine significantly inhibitedtumor growth. More TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in tumor sections were observedin trimebutine-treated mice when compared to the vehicle control. Reduced Bcl-2and upregulated Bax, as well as perturbed p-AKT and p-ERK signaling pathways werealso observed in trimebutine-treated xenograft tissues. Our combined dataindicated that trimebutine may be potentially applied for the clinical managementof glioma/glioblastoma.DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00664 PMCID: PMC6021541PMID: 29977208
