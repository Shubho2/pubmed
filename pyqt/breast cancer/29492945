Oncology (Williston Park). 2018 Feb 15;32(2):58-63.Management of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer in Older Patients: How Is ItDifferent?Shachar SS, Jolly TA, Jones E, Muss HB.Triple-negative breast cancer, which affects about 10% of older women with breastcancer, represents a major treatment challenge in this population. Treatmentdecisions for these patients can best be made based on geriatric assessment,estimated life expectancy, whether the treatment goal is prolonged survival orpalliation, the potential benefits and toxicities of a specific treatment, andthe patient's personal goals for treatment. Treatment outcomes for healthy older and younger women are similar, but great challenges exist in managing thevulnerable and frail patient. The cornerstone of therapy for early-stagetriple-negative breast cancer is local therapy (surgery and radiation) and, formost patients, adjuvant chemotherapy. In the management of metastatictriple-negative breast cancer, all therapy is palliative and chemotherapy is the treatment of choice. Since all treatment modalities in older patients-especially chemotherapy-can affect physical and mental function, a geriatric assessment iskey in selecting the most appropriate treatment strategy. Many older patients(older than 70 years) are poor candidates for state-of-the-art therapy, and some who have substantial comorbidities not related to breast cancer may opt forpalliative and hospice care. In this review, we will discuss the role ofgeriatric assessment, alternative treatment modalities for older women withtriple-negative breast cancer, and other special considerations for this patient population.PMID: 29492945  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
