Theprimary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end pointsconsisted of the response rate, overall survival (OS), and safety.Result: In total, 34 patients were registered between July 2009 and June 2012.The median follow-up time was 23.7 months (2-24 months). The 1- and 2-year PFSrates were 46.9% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 29.2%-62.9%) and 29.8% (95%CI: 15.0%-46.3%), respectively (median 10.6 months). The median PFS time forpatients receiving TZM combined with CTx was 13.9 months. The 1-and 2-year ORrates were 93.9 (95% CI: 77.9%-98.4%) and 84.8% (95% CI: 67.4%-93.4%).Trastuzumab-induced grade 3/4 adverse events were not observed.Conclusions: This study suggests that the PFS and OS in Japanese patients whorelapsed after perioperative TZM therapy improved or were similar to those inprevious reports. Differences in patient backgrounds and treatments must beconsidered when interpreting the results. Trastuzumab should be used combination with CTx and/or HTx for retreatment. Retreatment with TZM is safe.Trialregistration: UMIN000002738.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418786243 PMCID: PMC6043925PMID: 30013356
