Studies have reported that thecompliance of the treatment with breast cancer clinical practice guidelines(CPGs) is accompanied with a significant improvement of recurrence-free survival and overall survival rates. However, compliance of multidisciplinary tumour boarddecisions with CPGs remains non-satisfactory. The European project DESIREE aimsat building a software package to support the guideline-based management ofbreast cancer patients. The aim is to select multiple relevant contemporary CPGs published on the management of breast cancer and to concurrently apply them tobenefit of the complementarity of the recommendations issued, and leverage theguideline-based decision support. We used a clinical case to compare NCCN andESMO CPGs in terms of concordance, complementarity, and conflicts. Out of the 757decision rules extracted from both CPGs, 64 rules were triggered (32 from NCCN,and 32 from ESMO) by the clinical case. Ten rules were concordant, 52complementary, and two conflicting. Complementarity relies on the differentlevels of granularity of the IF-parts of the rules that lead to differentspecific THEN-parts. Another type of complementarity comes from the provision of specific care apart from the breast cancer therapeutic management. The few inter-and intra-CPGs conflicts show the limits of CPGs in particular situations stilldebated by medical research.PMID: 29678062  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
