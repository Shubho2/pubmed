A test-set involving 60 mammographic cases(20 cancer and 40 non-cancer) were read by 11 radiologists from a non-screening(NS) country during a workshop in July 2016. 52 radiologists from a screeningcountry read the same test-set at the Royal Australian and New Zealand College ofRadiologists' meetings in July 2015. The screening radiologists were classifiedinto two groups: those with less than or equal to 5 years of experience; thosewith more than 5 years of experience, and each group was compared to the group ofNS radiologists. A Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post-hoc multiple comparisons test were used to compare measures of diagnostic accuracy among the readergroups.  Results: The diagnostic accuracy of the NS radiologists wassignificantly lower in terms of sensitivity [mean = 54.0; 95% confidence interval(CI) (40.0-67.0)], location sensitivity [mean = 26.0; 95% CI (16.0-37.0)],receive roperating characteristic area under curve [mean = 73.0; 95% CI(66.5-81.0)] and Jackknifefree-response receiver operating characteristicsfigure-of-merit [mean = 45.0; 95% CI (40.0-50.0)] when compared with the less andmore experienced screening radiologists, whilst no difference in specificity[mean = 75.0; 95% CI (70.0- 81.0)] was found. No significant differences in allmeasured diagnostic accuracy were found between the two groups of screeningradiologists.CONCLUSION: The mammographic performance of a group of radiologists from acountry without screening program was suboptimal compared with radiologists from Australia.  Advances in knowledge: Identifying mammographic performance indeveloping countries is required to optimize breast cancer diagnosis.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20180071 PMID: 29987982
