Fructus mume (F. mume) hasbeen proved to be effective to treat chronic diarrhea with few side effects. The compounds from F. mume were extracted by using an ethanol method. Extracts of F. mume (EFM) were analyzed by HPLC. We investigated the protective effects of EFMon the diarrhea caused by lapatinib and capecitabine. From March 1st, 2016 toJune 1st, 2017, 208 breast cancer patients with diarrhea caused by lapatinib and capecitabine were recruited. The patients were evenly assigned into two groups:EG group (the patients took 100 mg EFM daily) and CG group (the patients tookplacebo daily). The effects of EFM on diarrhea and gastrointestinal symptoms weremeasured by a semiquantitative method seven-point Likert scale. Overall qualityof life was measured by SF-36 questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and DepressionScale (HADS). The HPLC analysis showed that there were three components in EFM,including citric acid, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), and chlorogenic acid.Breast cancer types were observed by using Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. Thebreast cancer can be divided into leaflet, gland and fibroblast types. Patientage, skin metastases, treatment, and grade 1 diarrhea were significant riskfactors associated with for grade 2 diarrhea. EFM reduced diarrhea andgastrointestinal symptoms by reducing the average scores of the diarrhea symptom and seven-point Likert scale, and improved life quality of patients significantlyby improving SF-36 scores and reducing HADS scores when compared to that in theCG group after 6-week therapy and further 4-week follow-up (P < 0.05). EFM may bea potential choice for the diarrhea therapy in breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00516 PMCID: PMC5974171PMID: 29875660
