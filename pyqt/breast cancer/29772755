Oncolyticvirotherapy may be a promising approach to treat TNBC. However, oncolyticadenovirus (OAd)-based mono-therapeutic clinical trials have resulted in modestoutcomes. The OAd potency could be increased by chemotherapy-induced autophagy,an intracellular degradation system that delivers cytoplasmic constituents to thelysosome. In this study, the ability of alkylating agent temozolomide(TMZ)-induced autophagy to increase OAd replication and oncolysis in TNBC cellswas evaluated. Human TNBC MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 cells and mouse 4T1 cells wereinfected with an OAd expressing the red fluorescent protein mCherry on the virus capsid (OAdmCherry) alone or in combination with TMZ. TNBC cells treated withOAdmCherry/TMZ displayed greater mCherry and adenovirus (Ad) early region 1A(E1A) expression and enhanced cancer-cell killing compared to OAdmCherry or TMZalone. The combined therapy-mediated cell death was associated with virusreplication and accumulation of the autophagy marker light chain 3 (LC3)-II.Overall, this study provides experimental evidence of TMZ's ability to increaseoncolytic virotherapy in both human and murine TNBC cells.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10050144 PMCID: PMC5977117PMID: 29772755
