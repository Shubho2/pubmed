Electronic address: kdh17_yy@sina.com.Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers, with high recurrence rateand poor prognosis of recurrent metastatic disease. In our study, we analyzed themarkers and development of markers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)for BC progression and occurrence. MDSCs is one of the major orchestrators of theimmunosuppressive network, are associated with immune suppression and considered a prime target for cancer immunotherapy. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a signaturecytokine of Th17 cells. Previous research has indicated that IL-17 plays aproinflammatory role. It was found to increase frequencies at certain tumors and involved in angiogenesis. This study aims to elucidate the biological role ofIL-17 on MDSC in BC cells. Expression of MDSC in peripheral blood of 80 BCEpatients and 20 healthy volunteers was compared. Our results indicate that MDSCnumbers in patients with BC were higher than healthy donors. Moreover, theclinical grade and prognosis were correlate with the number of MDSC. In thisstudy, we investigated the effect of IL-17 on MDSCs. CCK-8 assay and flowcytometry were used to assess the proliferation and apoptosis of cells. Theexpression of key MDSC-related molecules was detected by western blotting. Weidentified administration with IL-17 in vitro significantly induced MDSCdifferentiation, inhibited their proliferation and triggered apoptosis. Inaddition, Low IL-17 inhibited the activation of STAT3, leading to increaseformation of MDSCs in BC. Our results from experiments suggest that the effectsof IL-17 mediate activation of STAT3 signaling in BC cells. Taken together, ourstudy shows that MDSCs can be a new type prognostic marker in BC patient.Targeting IL-17/Stat3 signaling may be a promising strategy for BC treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
