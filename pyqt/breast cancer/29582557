Epub 2018 Mar 26.Five-year results of a phase II trial of preoperative 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin,cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel with capecitabine (wTX) (with trastuzumab in HER2-positive patients) for patients with stage II or III breast cancer.Holmes FA(1)(2), Hellerstedt BA(1)(3), Pippen JE Jr(1)(4), Vukelja SJ(1)(5),Collea RP(1)(6), Kocs DM(1)(7), Blum JL(1)(4), McIntyre KJ(1)(8), Barve MA(1)(8),Brooks BD(1)(9), Osborne CR(1)(4), Wang Y(1), Asmar L(1), O'Shaughnessy J(1)(4).Author information: (1)US Oncology Research, McKesson Specialty Health, The Woodlands, Texas.(2)Texas Oncology-Houston Memorial City, Houston, Texas.(3)Texas Oncology-Austin Central, Austin, Texas.(4)Texas Oncology-Baylor Sammons Cancer Center, Dallas, Texas.(5)Texas Oncology, Tyler, Texas.(6)New York Oncology Hematology, Albany, New York.(7)Texas Oncology, Round Rock, Texas.(8)Texas Oncology, Dallas Presbyterian Hospital, Dallas, Texas.(9)Texas Oncology, Medical City Dallas, Dallas, Texas.We aimed to increase pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with invasivebreast cancer by adding preoperative capecitabine to docetaxel following5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide (FEC) (with trastuzumab for patientswith HER2-positive disease) and to evaluate 5-year disease-free survival (DFS)associated with this preoperative regimen. Chemotherapy included four cycles ofFEC100 (5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 , epirubicin 100 mg/m2 , cyclophosphamide500 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 every 21 days) followed by 4 21-day cycles of docetaxel(35 mg/m2  days 1 and 8) concurrently with capecitabine (825 mg/m2 orally twicedaily for 14 days followed by 7 days off) (wTX). For HER2-positive patients,treatment was modified by decreasing epirubicin to 75 mg/m2 and addingtrastuzumab (H) in standard doses (FEC75-H →wTX-H). The study objective was toachieve a pCR rate in the breast and axillary lymph nodes of 37% in patients withHER2-negative breast cancer and of 67% in patients with HER2-positive breastcancer treated with preoperative trastuzumab. A total of 186 patients wereenrolled on study. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the pCR rate was 31% (37/118, 95% CI: 24-40%) in the HER2-negative patients, 24% (15/62, 95% CI: 14-37%) inER-positive/HER2-negative patients, 39% (22/56, 95% CI: 27-53%) in theER-negative/HER2-negative patients, and 46% (29/63, 95% CI: 34-48%) in theHER2-positive patients. The pCR rate in the 40 trastuzumab-treated patients was53% (21/40, 95% CI: 38-67%). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events included neutropenia,leukopenia, diarrhea, and hand-foot skin reactions. One trastuzumab-treatedpatient developed grade 3 cardiotoxicity, and 4 others experienced grade 1-2decrements in left ventricular function; all five patients' cardiac functionreturned to their baseline upon completion of trastuzumab. At 5 years,disease-free survival was 70% in the HER2-negative population (78% inER-positive/HER2-negative and 62% in the ER-negative/HER2-negative patients) and 80% in the HER2-positive patients (87% in the trastuzumab-treated HER2-positivepatients). At 5 years, overall survival was 80% in the HER2-negative population(88% in ER-positive/HER2-negative and 71% in the ER-negative/HER2-negativepatients) and 86% in the HER2-positive patients (94.5% in the trastuzumab-treatedHER2-positive patients). FEC100 (FEC75 with trastuzumab) followed by weeklydocetaxel plus capecitabine, with or without trastuzumab is a safe, effectivepreoperative cytotoxic regimen. However, the addition of capecitabine todocetaxel following FEC, with or without trastuzumab, did not increase pCR rates nor 5-year DFS over the rates that have been reported with standard preoperative doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by paclitaxel, with or withouttrastuzumab. Therefore, the use of capecitabine as part of preoperativechemotherapy is not recommended.© 2018 The Authors.
