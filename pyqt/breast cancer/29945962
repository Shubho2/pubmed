Here we show that frequentdeletion of the MIR135A1 locus is associated with poor prognosis in primarybreast cancer. Forced expression of miR-135a decreased breast cancer progression,whilst inhibition of miR-135a with a specific miRNA sponge elicited opposingeffects, suggestive of a tumor suppressive role of miR-135a in breast cancer.Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) bound the promoter of MIR135A1 for itstranscriptional activation, whereas tamoxifen treatment inhibited expression ofmiR-135a in ERα+ breast cancer cells. miR-135a directly targeted ESR1, ESRRA, andNCOA1, forming a negative feedback loop to inhibit ERα signaling. This regulatoryfeedback between miR-135a and ERα demonstrated that miR-135a regulated theresponse to tamoxifen. The tamoxifen-mediated decrease in miR-135a expressionincreased the expression of miR-135a targets to reduce tamoxifen sensitivity.Consistently, miR-135a expression was downregulated in ERα+ breast cancer cellswith acquired tamoxifen resistance, while forced expression of miR-135a partiallyre-sensitized these cells to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen resistance mediated by the lossof miR-135a was shown to be partially dependent on the activation of ERK1/2 andAKT pathways by miR-135a-targeted genes. Taken together, these results indicatethat deletion of the MIR135A1 locus and decreased miR-135a expression promotesERα+ breast cancer progression and tamoxifen resistance.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-0069 PMID: 29945962
