[Epub ahead ofprint]Genetic Variations, Exposure to Persistent Organic Pollutants and Breast CancerRisk - A Greenlandic Case-Control Study.Wielsøe M(1), Eiberg H(2), Ghisari M(1), Kern P(3), Lind O(3), Bonefeld-JørgensenEC(1)(4).Author information: (1)Centre for Arctic Health & Molecular Epidemiology, Aarhus University, AarhusC, Denmark.(2)Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Copenhagen,Copenhagen, Denmark.(3)Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Dronning Ingrid's Hospital, Nuuk,Greenland.(4)Institute for Nursing and Health Science, Greenland's Center of HealthResearch, University of Greenland, Nuuk, Greenland.This study investigated the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in xenobiotic and steroid hormone-metabolizing genes in relation to breast cancerrisk and explored possible effect modifications on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and breast cancer associations. The study also assessed effects ofGreenlandic BRCA1 founder mutations. Greenlandic Inuit women (77 cases and 84controls) were included. We determined two founder mutations in BRCA1: Cys39Gly(rs80357164) and 4684delCC, and five SNPs in xenobiotic andoestrogen-metabolizing genes: CYP17A1 -34T>C (rs743572), CYP19A1 *19C>T(rs10046), CYP1A1 Ile462Val (rs1048943), CYP1B Leu432Val (rs1056836) and COMTVal158Met (rs4680). We used chi-square test for comparison of categoricalvariables between groups. Odds ratio (OR) estimates with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were obtained using logistic regression models. The variant allele ofBRCA1 Cys39Gly increased breast cancer risk (Gly/Cys versus Cys/Cys, OR: 12.2,95%CI: 1.53; 98.1), and carriers of the variant allele of CYP17A1 -34T>C hadreduced risk (CT+CC versus TT, OR: 0.44, 95%CI: 0.21; 0.93). CYP17A1 -34T>C wasan effect modifier on the association between perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) andbreast cancer risk (∑PFAA, ratio of OR: 0.18, 95%CI: 0.03; 0.97). Non-significantmodifying tendencies were seen for the other SNPs on the effect ofpolychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides and PFAAs. In summary, theBRCA1 Cys39Gly and CYP17A1 -34T>C genetic variations were associated with breast cancer risk. Our results indicate that the evaluated genetic variants modify the effects of POP exposure on breast cancer risk; however, further studies areneeded to document the data from the relatively small sample size.© 2018 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former NordicPharmacological Society).DOI: 10.1111/bcpt.13002 PMID: 29510000
