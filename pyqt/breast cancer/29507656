The benefits of A) continuedanti-estrogen therapy for anti-estrogen-resistant disease in the context ofmTORC1 inhibition, and B) adjuvant everolimus in combination with anti-estrogentherapy for early-stage disease are being tested clinically, but molecularrationale remains unclear. We hypothesized that mTORC1 inhibition activates theIGF-1R/InsR/IRS-1/2 axis in an ER-dependent manner to drive PI3K/AKT and promote cancer cell survival, implicating ER in survival signaling induced by mTORC1inhibition. Anti-estrogen treatment synergized with RAD001 to inhibit ER+ breast cancer cell growth. Inhibition of ER, IGF-1R/InsR, or IRS-1/2 suppressed AKTactivation induced by mTORC1 inhibition. RAD001 primed IGF-1R/InsR foractivation, which was enhanced by ER signaling. Post-menopausal patients withearly-stage ER+ breast cancer were treated presurgically +/- the AI letrozole.Viable tumor fragments from surgical specimens were treated with RAD001 and/orOSI-906 ex vivo; RAD001 increased AKT activation, which was abrogated bypresurgical letrozole. Letrozole decreased IGF-1R and IRS-1/2 tumor levels. Thesedata suggest that ER drives PI3K/AKT activation in response to mTORC1 inhibition,providing molecular rationale for therapeutic combinations of anti-estrogens and mTORC1 inhibitors in endocrine-sensitive disease.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24256 PMCID: PMC5823630PMID: 29507656
