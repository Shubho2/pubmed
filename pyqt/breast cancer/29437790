Gabriela.Kramer-Marek@icr.ac.uk.Purpose: Recent studies have highlighted a role of HER3 in HER2-driven cancers(e.g., breast cancer), implicating the upregulation of the receptor in resistanceto HER-targeted therapies and Hsp90 inhibitors (e.g., AUY922). Therefore, we havedeveloped an affibody-based PET radioconjugate that quantitatively assesses HER3 changes induced by Hsp90 inhibition in vivoExperimental Design: ZHER3:8698affibody molecules were conjugated via the C-terminus cysteine to DFO-maleimidefor 89Zr radiolabeling. The probe was characterized in vitro and in vivo in apanel of human breast cell lines and xenograft models with varying HER3 receptor levels. In addition, the radioconjugate was investigated as a tool to monitor theoutcome of AUY922, an Hsp90 inhibitor, in an MCF-7 xenograft model.Results: Wedemonstrated that 89Zr-DFO-ZHER3:8698 can track changes in receptor expression inHER3-positive xenograft models and monitor the outcome of AUY922 treatment. Ourin vitro findings showed that MCF-7 cells, which are phenotypically differentfrom BT474, develop resistance to treatment with AUY922 throughHER3/IGF-1Rβ-mediated signaling. Of note, the lack of response in vitro due toHER3 recovery was confirmed in vivo using 89Zr-DFO-ZHER3:8698-based imaging. UponAUY922 treatment, higher radioconjugate uptake was detected in treated MCF-7xenografts, correlating with an AUY922-induced HER3 upregulation concomitant withan increase in IGF-1Rβ expression.Conclusions: These data underline the potentialof HER3-based PET imaging to noninvasively provide information about HER3expression and to identify patients not responding to targeted therapies due toHER3 recovery.
