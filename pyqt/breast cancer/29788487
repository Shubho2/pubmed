The 2 × 2 factorial design allows a single randomizedtrial to investigate the effect of two factors and interactions between them.Outcomes were changes in fasting insulin, glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP),estradiol, testosterone, and sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The trial waspowered for a main effects analysis of metformin vs placebo and weight loss vscontrol. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.Results: A total of 313 women (94.0%) completed the six-month trial. Highprescription adherence (ie, ≥80% of pills taken) ranged from 65.9% ofparticipants in the metformin group to 81.3% of those in the placebo group (P <.002). Mean percent weight loss was statistically significantly higher in theweight loss group (-5.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -6.3% to -4.8%) comparedwith the control group (-2.7%, 95% CI = -3.5% to -1.9%). Statisticallysignificant group differences (ie, percent change in metformin group minusplacebo group) were -7.9% (95% CI = -15.0% to -0.8%) for insulin, -10.0% (95% CI = -18.5% to -1.5%) for estradiol, -9.5% (95% CI = -15.2% to -3.8%) fortestosterone, and 7.5% (95% CI = 2.4% to 12.6%) for SHBG. Statisticallysignificant group differences (ie, percent change in weight loss group minusplacebo group) were -12.5% (95% CI = -19.6% to -5.3%) for insulin and 5.3% (95%CI = 0.2% to 10.4%) for SHBG.Conclusions: As adjuvant therapy, weight loss and metformin were found to be asafe combination strategy that modestly lowered estrogen levels andadvantageously affected other biomarkers thought to be on the pathway forreducing breast cancer recurrence and mortality.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy040 PMID: 29788487
