In contrast to breast cancer, high-level evidence is not available to guide treatment.Management is therefore largely based on individual physicianexperience/training. The American board of internal medicine (ABIM) initiated itsChoosing Wisely® campaign to promote conversations between patients andphysicians about challenging the use of tests or procedures which may not benecessary. The American society of breast surgeons (ASBrS) Patient safety andquality committee (PSQC) chose to participate in this campaign in regard to themanagement of benign breast disease.METHODS: The PSQC solicited initial candidate measures. PSQC surgeons represent awide variety of practices. The resulting measures were ranked by modified Delphi appropriateness methodology in two rounds. The final list was approved by ASBrSand endorsed by the ABIM.RESULTS: The final five measures are as follows. (1) Don't routinely excise areasof pseuodoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) of the breast in patients whoare not having symptoms from it. (2) Don't routinely surgically excisebiopsy-proven fibroadenomas that are < 2 cm. (3) Don't routinely operate for abreast abscess without an initial attempt to percutaneously aspirate. (4) Don'tperform screening mammography in asymptomatic patients with normal exams who haveless than a 5-years life expectancy. (5) Don't routinely drain nonpainful,fluid-filled cysts.CONCLUSIONS: The ASBrS Choosing Wisely® measures that address benign breastdisease management are easily accessible to patients via the internet. Consensus was reached by PSQC regarding these recommendations. These measures provideguidance for shared decision-making.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6584-5 PMID: 29968026
