This study explored the impact of acomplementary and integrative medicine (CIM) program on taxane-induced peripheralneuropathy (TIPN).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Taxane-treated female patients with breast andgynecological cancer reporting TIPN-related symptoms were referred to anintegrative physician, followed by patient-tailored CIM treatments (acupuncturewith/without other modalities). Assessment of study outcomes at 6 to 12 weeks wasconducted using the Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing, which documentedfree-text narratives about patients' experience during the CIM treatment process.Content was analyzed using ATLAS.Ti software.RESULTS: Of the 125 patients treated with taxanes, 69 had been referred for CIMtreatment of TIPN-associated symptoms. Multidisciplinary narrative analysisidentified 2 groups of CIM-treated patients: those with an apparently moderateimprovement in symptoms (n = 35) and those with either only an apparent mild orno improvement at all. For 10 patients, assessment of their response to treatmentwas unclear. The 2 identified groups had similar demographic, cancer-related, andquality of life-related parameters at baseline. Content analysis of patients withan apparent moderate improvement suggested a short-term (24-48 hours) effect withacupuncture treatment, either alone or combined with manual, mind-body, andanthroposophic music therapies. Symptoms showing improvement included paresthesiaand numbness.CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture and other CIM therapies may result in a short-term andtransitory reduction in TIPN-related symptoms.DOI: 10.1097/IGC.0000000000001246 PMID: 29561303
