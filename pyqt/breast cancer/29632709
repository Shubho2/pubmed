Previously, weshowed that the combination of IFNγ and anti-HER2/neu antibody synergisticallyreduces tumor growth in an in vivo implanted mammary tumor model. Here, we reporta recombinant approach to produce an anti-HER2/neu scFv and IFNγ fusion proteinusing an engineered effector domain (EED) scaffold. The new molecule induces invitro apoptosis in an IFNγ receptor-dependent manner. At a very low dose in thein vivo xenografted tumor models, the new EED-IFNγ fusion protein demonstratessuperior activity over the anti-HER2/neu antibody and is even active on tumorsthat are resistant to anti-HER2/neu antibody therapy. Examination of tumorinfiltrated macrophages and lymphocytes reveals that the fusion protein caninduce changes in tumor microenvironment to support immune reactivity againsttumors. Our studies have defined a targeted immunotherapy approach for thetreatment of cancers.DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1300739 PMCID: PMC5889208 [Available on 2019-02-08]PMID: 29632709
