This study examined whether having an abnormal mammogram,considered a proxy for elevated risk perception, was associated with greaterfuture health service use (outpatient visits and referrals).STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data,spanning 2008 to 2012, from Boston Medical Center, a safety-net hospital.METHODS: We grouped 3920 women aged 40 to 75 years receiving primary care and whohad a mammogram between 2010 and 2011 into 3 categories: false-positive mammogramat index date; previous false positive, but normal index mammogram; and nohistory of false-positive mammograms. We contrasted the longitudinal changes inoutpatient visits and provider referrals, before versus after the indexmammogram, between women with false-positive mammogram and those without usingPoisson regression models with a difference-in-differences specification.Clinical, visit, and demographic data were obtained from the institutionalclinical data warehouse.RESULTS: Adjusting for baseline differences in sociodemographic characteristicsacross risk groups and for secular changes between pre- and postindex periods, a current false-positive mammogram was associated with an 18% increase in overalloutpatient visits (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.51), but nocorresponding increase in provider referrals (IRR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.99â€‘1.34),relative to never having a false positive. A previous false-positive mammogramhad no associated change in outpatient utilization (IRR, 0.99; 95% CI,0.91-1.07).CONCLUSIONS: Providers should discuss the implications of mammography findings atthe time of screening to help mitigate potential detrimental effects and promote appropriate engagement in health services.PMID: 29553275
