Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase complexes 4and 6 (CDK4/6) combined with ET has shown significant activity in HR+ HER2- ABC, with impressive results in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) when comparedwith ET alone. This review summarizes the seminal findings pertaining to CDK4/6inhibition in this population, specifically focusing on abemaciclib, contrastedwith palbociclib and ribociclib. Potential directions for future studies arediscussed, as a way of addressing outstanding issues such as establishing optimaltreatment sequencing and agent combinations, appropriate patient selection toderive maximal benefits, predictive biomarkers and the employment of CDK4/6inhibition beyond the ABC setting.DOI: 10.1177/1758835918776925 PMCID: PMC5985604PMID: 29899762
