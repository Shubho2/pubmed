In women and men, respectively, hazardratios per 5 kg lower grip strength were higher (all at P<0.05) for all causemortality (1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.23, and 1.16, 1.15 to 1.17)and cause specific mortality from cardiovascular disease (1.19, 1.13 to 1.25, and1.22, 1.18 to 1.26), all respiratory disease (1.31, 1.22 to 1.40, and 1.24, 1.20 to 1.28), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.24, 1.05 to 1.47, and 1.19,1.09 to 1.30), all cancer (1.17, 1.13 to 1.21, 1.10, 1.07 to 1.13), colorectalcancer (1.17, 1.04 to 1.32, and 1.18, 1.09 to 1.27), lung cancer (1.17, 1.07 to1.27, and 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), and breast cancer (1.24, 1.10 to 1.39) but notprostate cancer (1.05, 0.96 to 1.15). Several of these relations had higherhazard ratios in the younger age group. Muscle weakness (defined as grip strength<26 kg for men and <16 kg for women) was associated with a higher hazard for all health outcomes, except colon cancer in women and prostate cancer and lung cancerin both men and women. The addition of handgrip strength improved the prediction ability, based on C index change, of an office based risk score (age, sex,diabetes diagnosed, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and smoking) forall cause (0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (0.012) and incidence ofcardiovascular disease (0.009).CONCLUSION: Higher grip strength was associated with a range of health outcomesand improved prediction of an office based risk score. Further work on the use ofgrip strength in risk scores or risk screening is needed to establish itspotential clinical utility.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.
