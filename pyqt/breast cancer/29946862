We sought to determine whether estrogen-receptor (ER) status influenced CBC risk.METHODS: We identified women aged 40-79 with DCIS diagnosed between 1990 and 2002using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. We usedmultivariable competing risk regression to examine predictors of time from index DCIS to CBC (invasive or in situ).RESULTS: Multivariable competing risk regression found ER status to be a highlysignificant predictor of CBC. The 10-year cumulative incidence was estimated tobe 5.3% (95% CI 4.8-5.8%) among ER positive (ER+) cases and 3.3% (95% CI2.6-4.0%) among ER negative (ER-).CONCLUSIONS: This finding suggests that ER+â€‰DCIS may represent a field effectthat confers increased propensity for developing cancer across breast tissue,regardless of laterality. In contrast, ER- DCIS may represent an isolated localevent. Given that the majority of DCIS is ER+, and only a minority of DCISpatients receive hormonal therapy, consideration of ER status may influencetreatment and surveillance approaches.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4860-5 PMID: 29946862
