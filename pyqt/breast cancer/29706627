However, the role of Rnd1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)progression remains unclear. In this study, our results demonstrated that Rnd1was downregulated in HCC cells and in human HCC tissues. Low expression of Rnd1was associated with aggressive clinic-pathologic characteristics, such asvascular invasion, and poor prognosis in patients who underwent curative surgery for HCC. Overexpression of Rnd1-suppressed cell growth, migration, invasion, and EMT processes in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Rnd1 blocked HCC progression by restricting EMT process through inhibition of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, and thiswas correlated with a reduction in RhoA activity. Combination of Rnd1overexpression with sorafenib, a Raf signaling pathway inhibitor, showed a morepotent inhibition on HCC metastasis. Moreover, epigenetic inhibitors (5-Aza andSAHA) increased the expression of Rnd1, and potentiated sorafenib-inducedtoxicity in HCC cells. In a conclusion, Rnd1-suppressed EMT-mediated metastasisof HCC by reducing the activity of the RhoA/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway,functioning as a favorable anti-metastasis target for HCC patients. Rnd1overexpression in combination with sorafenib may result in enhancedanti-metastasis efficacy in HCC.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0517-x PMCID: PMC5924761PMID: 29706627
