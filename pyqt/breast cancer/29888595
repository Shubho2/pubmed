In comparison to theirSchiff base counterparts 2a and 2b, we demonstrate that amine complexes 5a and 5bdisplay (i) a higher in vitro antiproliferative activity on different humancancer cell lines, (ii) a lower rate of hydrolysis, and (iii) an improved initialcatalytic rate for the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. In contrast to their imineanalogues 2a and 2b, we also show that amine complexes 5a and 5b induce thegeneration of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Our results highlight the impact that a simple ligand modification such asthe reduction of an imine moiety can have on both the catalytic and biologicalactivities of metal complexes. Moreover, the ruthenium complexes reported heredisplay some antiproliferative activity against T47D breast cancer cells, knownfor their cis-platin resistance.DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00346 PMID: 29888595
