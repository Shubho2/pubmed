[Epubahead of print]Histone demethylase KDM2B promotes triple negative breast cancer proliferation bysuppressing p15INK4B, p16INK4A, and p57KIP2 transcription.Zheng Q(1)(2), Fan H(1)(2), Meng Z(3), Yuan L(2), Liu C(2)(4), Peng Y(2), ZhaoW(2), Wang L(2), Li J(2)(5), Feng J(1)(2)(4).Author information: (1)The Third School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China.(2)Department of Laboratory Medicine & Central Laboratory, Southern MedicalUniversity Affiliated Fengxian Hospital, Shanghai, China.(3)Department of Laboratory Medicine & Central Laboratory, Jinzhou MedicalUniversity Affiliated Fengxian Hospital, Shanghai, China.(4)Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences, Affiliated Sixth People'sHospital South Campus, Shanghai, China.(5)Joint Research Center for Precision Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University & Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital South Campus, Shanghai, China.H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 histone demethylase KDM2B is an epigenetic regulatory factorinvolved in cell proliferation in numerous cells including breast cancer cells,however, the regulatory mechanism of KDM2B in cell proliferation of breast cancercells, specifically in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), remains largelyunknown. In this study, we showed that higher expression level of KDM2B wasassociated with poor prognosis in TNBC. Using cell proliferation assay, we found that KDM2B promoted TNBC cell proliferation by suppressing the transcription ofthe cell cycle inhibitors p15INK4B, p16INK4A, and p57KIP2. Chromatinimmunoprecipitation assay results showed that KDM2B bound to the promoters ofthese genes and thereby reduced the H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 levels, leading to thesuppression of gene transcription in a histone demethylation activity-dependentmanner. Silencing of p15INK4B, p16INK4A, and p57KIP2 in TNBC cells was shown torestore the promoting effect of KDM2B on TNBC cell proliferation. The presentstudy reveals a novel cell regulatory mechanism through which KDM2B promotes TNBCcell proliferation by binding to the promoters of p15INK4B, p16INK4A, andp57KIP2, which reduces H3K4me3 and H3K36me2 levels to suppress genetranscription.DOI: 10.1093/abbs/gmy084 PMID: 30060056
