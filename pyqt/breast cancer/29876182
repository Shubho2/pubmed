Two hundred thirty-nine BC patients who underwent treatment > 5 years wereexcluded due to potential recall bias and changes in BC treatment paradigms. All subjects who did not complete the adaptive conjoint-based survey were alsoexcluded due to inability to calculate preferences. The final sample consisted of522 healthy women and 71 previous BC patients.Interventions or Exposures: Study of patient preference and decision drivers,without, interventions or exposures.Main Outcomes and Measures: Shares of preferences for various surgical treatment options were calculated using the highest-ranked factors, by the importance that drove patient decision-making.Results: Survey response rate was 69.5%. Among healthy women, the most important of the 9 factors in making a surgical choice were doctor's recommendation at21.4% (SD, 13.6%) and overall survival (OS) at 20.5% (SD, 9.8%) while amongprevious BC patients, the most important factor was OS at 19% (SD, 9%) anddoctor's recommendation at 17.2% (SD, 10.3%).Conclusion and Relevance: While OS accounted for the largest single driver ofpatient choice at ~20 %, it is notable that 80% of patient decision-making wasdriven by factors unrelated to survival such as cost, intensity and recoverytime, and breast image. By understanding what drives choice, we can providebetter patient-centric education and treatments.DOI: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000001746 PMCID: PMC5977949PMID: 29876182
