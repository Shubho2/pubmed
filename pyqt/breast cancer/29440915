ER, PR, HER2 andKi67 statuses were compared between pretreatment and posttreatment residualsamples. A control group of paired core and excision tumors from 123 patients whodid not receive NAC within the same study period was also assessed. Data onpatients' clinicopathologic features were collected to identify associatedinfluencing factors.Results: Ki67 value significantly increased in excision tumors compared withpaired core samples in controls without presurgery treatment (P<0.01), which was associated with the pathologic lymph node status and the interaction of PR andHER2 status (P=0.008 and 0.028, respectively). In 143 patients who underwent NAC,a significant decrease was observed in the expression of PR and Ki67 after NAC(P=0.003 and P<0.01, respectively). Further subgroup analysis showed that PRdecrease was more obvious in premenopausal patients and Luminal A patients(P=0.006 and 0.002, respectively).Conclusion: Core samples could provide more reliable information on determinationof molecular subtype than surgical excisions. Decreases in PR and Ki67 expressionfollowing NAC could be used as positive prognostic factors. We recommend repeattesting of these biologic markers following NAC for the sake of better diseasemanagement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study toanalyze the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on molecular alteration and itsassociated influencing factors after reporting a CNB-associated Ki67 increase in the same study.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S145715 PMCID: PMC5798570PMID: 29440915
