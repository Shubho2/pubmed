Multi-gene signatures forbreast cancer stratification have been extensively studied in the past decadesand more than 30 different signatures have been reported. A major concern is the minimal overlap of genes among the reported signatures. We investigated thebreast cancer signature genes to address our hypothesis that the genes ofdifferent signature may share common functions, as well as to use thesepreviously reported signature genes to build better prognostic models.METHODS: A total of 33 signatures and the corresponding gene lists wereinvestigated. We first examined the gene frequency and the gene overlap in these signatures. Then the gene functions of each signature gene list were analysed andcompared by the KEGG pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms. A classifier builtusing the common genes was tested using the METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy ofBreast Cancer International Consortium) data. The common genes were also testedfor building the Yin Yang gene mean expression ratio (YMR) signature using publicdatasets (GSE1456 and GSE2034).RESULTS: Among a total of 2239 genes collected from the 33 breast cancersignatures, only 238 genes overlapped in at least two signatures; while from atotal of 1979 function terms enriched in the 33 signature gene lists, 429 termswere common in at least two signatures. Most of the common function terms wereinvolved in cell cycle processes. While there is almost no common overlappinggenes between signatures developed for ER-positive (e.g. 21-gene signature) andthose developed for ER-negative (e.g. basal signatures) tumours, they have commonfunction terms such as cell death, regulation of cell proliferation. We used the 62 genes that were common in at least three signatures as a classifier andsubtyped 1141 METABRIC cases including 144 normal samples into nine subgroups.These subgroups showed different clinical outcome. Among the 238 common genes, weselected those genes that are more highly expressed in normal breast tissue than in tumours as Yang genes and those more highly expressed in tumours than innormal as Yin genes and built a YMR model signature. This YMR showed significancein risk stratification in two datasets (GSE1456 and GSE2034).CONCLUSIONS: The lack of significant numbers of overlapping genes among mostbreast cancer signatures can be partially explained by our discovery that thesesignature genes represent groups with similar functions. The genes collected fromthese previously reported signatures are valuable resources for new modeldevelopment. The subtype classifier and YMR signature built from the common genesshowed promising results.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4388-4 PMCID: PMC5921990PMID: 29699511
