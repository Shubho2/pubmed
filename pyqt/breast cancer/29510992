Using an extensive and well-annotated breast cancer tissue collection, we identifiedthe loss of nuclear but not cytoplasmic CHIP to predict more aggressivetumorigenesis and shorter patient survival, with loss of CHIP in two thirds ofErbB2+ and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) and in one third of ER+ breastcancers. Reduced CHIP expression was seen in breast cancer patient-derivedxenograft tumors and in ErbB2+ and TNBC cell lines. Ectopic CHIP expression inErbB2+ lines suppressed in vitro oncogenic traits and in vivo xenograft tumorgrowth. An unbiased screen for CHIP-regulated nuclear transcription factorsidentified many candidates whose DNA-binding activity was up- or downregulated byCHIP. We characterized myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) as a CHIP target, given itsrecently identified role as a positive regulator of cathepsin B/L(CTSB/L)-mediated tumor cell invasion downstream of ErbB2. We show that CHIPnegatively regulates CTSB/L expression in ErbB2+ and other breast cancer celllines. CTSB inhibition abrogates invasion and matrix degradation in vitro andhalts ErbB2+ breast cancer cell line xenograft growth. We conclude that loss ofCHIP remodels the cellular transcriptome to unleash critical pro-oncogenicpathways, such as the matrix-degrading enzymes of the cathepsin family, whosecomponents can provide new therapeutic opportunities in breast and other cancers with loss of CHIP expression.Significance: These findings reveal a noveltargetable pathway of breast oncogenesis unleashed by the loss of tumorsuppressor ubiquitin ligase CHIP/STUB1.
