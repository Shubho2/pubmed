The objective of this study was to compare the current practices of a French radiotherapydepartment for the treatment of uncomplicated bone metastases with data from the literature in order to improve and optimize the management of patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective monocentric study of patients who underwentpalliative irradiation of uncomplicated bone metastases was performed.RESULTS: Ninety-one patients had 116 treatments of uncomplicated bone metastases between January 2014 and December 2015, including 44 men (48%) and 47 women (52%)with an average age of 63years (25-88years). Primary tumours most commonly found were breast cancer (35%), lung cancer (16%) and prostate cancer (12%). Theregimens used were in 29% of cases 30Gy in ten fractions (group 30Gy), in 21% of cases 20Gy in five fractions (group 20Gy), in 22% of cases 8Gy in one fraction(group 8Gy) and in 28% of cases 23.31Gy in three fractions of stereotactic bodyirradiation (stereotactic group). The general condition of the patient (P<0.001),pain score and analgesic (P<0.001), oligometastatic profile (P=0.003) andpractitioner experience (P<0.001) were factors influencing the choice of theregimen irradiation. Age (P=0.46), sex (P=0.14), anticancer treatments (P=0.56), concomitant hospitalization (P=0.14) and the distance between the radiotherapycentre and home (P=0.87) did not influence the decision significantly. A total ofthree cases of spinal compression and one case of post-therapeutic fracture were observed, occurring between one and 128days and 577days after irradiation,respectively. Eight percent of all irradiated metastases were reirradiated with adelay ranging between 13 and 434days after the first irradiation. There-irradiation rate was significantly higher after 8Gy (P=0.02). The rate ofdeath was significantly lower in the stereotactic arm (P<0.001) and overallsurvival was significantly greater in the stereotactic arm (P<0.001).CONCLUSION: This study showed that patients' analysed was comparable to thepopulation of different studies. Predictive factors for the choice of thetreatment regimen were identified. Non-fractionnated therapy was underutilisedwhile stereotactic treatment was increasingly prescribed, showing an evolution inthe management of patients.Copyright © 2018.
