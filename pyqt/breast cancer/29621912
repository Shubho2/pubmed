Providing severaladvantages over conventional antibodies, variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain antibodies (VHH) is now major tools in diagnostic and therapeuticapplications. Active targeting of liposomal drugs is a promising strategy,resulting in enhanced binding and improved cytotoxicity of tumour cells. In thepresent study, we produced four anti-HER2 recombinant VHHs and purified them via native and refolding method. ELISA and flow cytometry analysis confirmed almostidentical function of VHHs in refolded and native states. Using a mixture of fourpurified VHHs, PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin was targeted againstHER2-overexpressing cells. The drug release was analyzed at pH 7.4, 6.4 and 5.5and dynamic light-scattering detector and TEM micrograph was applied tocharacterize the produced nanoparticles. The binding efficiency of thesenanoparticles to BT474 and SKBR3 as HER2-positive and MCF10A as HER2-negativecell line was examined by flow cytometry. Our results indicated effectiveencapsulation of about 94% of the total drug in immunoliposomes. Flow cytometryresults verified receptor-specific binding of targeted liposomes to SKBR3 andBT474 cell lines and more efficient binding was observed for liposomes conjugatedwith oligoclonal VHHs mixture compared with monoclonal VHH-targeted liposomes.Oligoclonal nanoparticles also showed more cytotoxicity compared withnon-targeted liposomes against HER2-positive tumour cells. Oligoclonal targeting of liposomes was represented as a promising strategy for the treatment ofHER2-overexpressing breast cancers.DOI: 10.1080/08982104.2018.1430829 PMID: 29621912
