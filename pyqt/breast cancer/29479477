With the expiration and overturning of the BRCA patents, limitations on which laboratories couldoffer commercial testing were lifted. These legal changes occurred approximately the same time as the widespread adoption of massively parallel sequencing (MPS)technologies. Little is known about how these changes impacted laboratorypractices for detecting genetic alterations in hereditary breast and ovariancancer genes. Therefore, we sought to examine current laboratory genetic testing practices for BRCA1/BRCA2. We employed an online survey of 65 questions covering four areas: laboratory characteristics, details on technological methods, variantclassification, and client-support information. Eight United States (US)laboratories and 78 non-US laboratories completed the survey. Most laboratories(93%; 80/86) used MPS platforms to identify variants. Laboratories differedwidely on: (1) technologies used for large rearrangement detection; (2) criteria for minimum read depths; (3) non-coding regions sequenced; (4) variantclassification criteria and approaches; (5) testing volume ranging from 2 to2.5 × 105 tests annually; and (6) deposition of variants into public databases.These data may be useful for national and international agencies to setrecommendations for quality standards for BRCA1/BRCA2 clinical testing. Thesestandards could also be applied to testing of other disease genes.DOI: 10.1038/s41525-018-0046-7 PMCID: PMC5814433PMID: 29479477
