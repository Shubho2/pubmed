Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier breast cancerspecific survival was computed. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling was used tocompute the adjusted risk of breast cancer specific mortality for women who were single, separated, divorced, and widowed when compared with women who weremarried. Models were adjusted for age, stage, tumor grade, SES, and treatmentwith surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and radiation therapy. Hazard ratios(HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported.RESULTS: Separated (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.14-2.01) and widowed (HR: 1.39; 95%CI:1.23-1.57) white women had a higher risk of mortality than white married womenwhereas single and divorced white women had the same risk of mortality. ForAsian/Pacific Islanders (API), only single (HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.17-2.06) anddivorced (HR:1.81; 95% CI:1.26-2.60) women had a higher risk of mortality thanmarried women. Marital status had no influence on risk of mortality for eitherblack or Hispanic women.CONCLUSIONS: The risk of mortality associated with marital status is dependent onrace/ethnicity. Only white and API women with TNBC have a marital advantage.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196134 PMCID: PMC5919436PMID: 29698415  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
