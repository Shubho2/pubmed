It will focus on how different anesthetic agents and perioperative interventions might affect both breast cancer behavior and/or tumor recurrence aswell as postoperative recovery. The main objective of this study will be todescribe the evidence and critically analyze preclinical and clinical studies on the use of intravenous versus inhaled anesthetic agents, opioids, regionalanesthetics, and anesthetic adjuncts in patients undergoing breast cancerresection. We will look both at the evidence regarding cancer-related outcomesand postoperative recovery. A search of PubMed, from inception to May 2017 wasperformed using Mesh terms Breast Neoplasms [Mesh] OR cancer AND breast ANDAnesthesia [Mesh]; "Anesthetics"[Mesh] AND "Breast Neoplasms/surgery"[Mesh].Although no optimal anesthetic combination has been identified for patientsundergoing breast cancer resection, it should be noted that based on theavailable evidence, an ideal anesthetic in this patient population would involve a combination of TIVA (propofol), regional anesthesia (paravertebral block)), nonopioid sedatives (clonidine or dexmedetomidine), and COX-2 inhibition(ketorolac). Based on the current evidence, this combination of anesthetic andanalgesic agents has the best chance of improving cancer-related outcomes andpostoperative recovery.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
