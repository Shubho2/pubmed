Despite the influx of funding in the research community for patient-centered research, research on how to effectively engage patients and stakeholders in the research process is still relativelynascent. Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) inSeattle, WA, was an early recipient of PCORI research funding and, as of December2017, has received 8 PCORI research awards totaling nearly $15 million.Anticipating the pivotal importance of PCORI's patient-focused approach, KPWHRIdeveloped a set of 8 principles to guide how research teams should work withpatients and other stakeholders to simultaneously achieve research aims andembrace this new paradigm in how research teams collaborate. With a goal ofassisting other research teams, this article describes the genesis of the KPWHRI principles, their relevance to patient- and stakeholder-engaged research, and howthese principles were brought to life in the context of a specific PCORI-fundedproject on surveillance imaging in women after a breast cancer diagnosis.DOI: 10.7812/TPP/17-232 PMCID: PMC6004970PMID: 29911967
