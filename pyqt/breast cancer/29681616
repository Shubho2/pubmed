Epub 2018Apr 23.Progress in preventive therapy for cancer: a reminiscence and personal viewpoint.Cuzick J(1).Author information: (1)Centre for Cancer Prevention, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6BQ, UK.j.cuzick@qmul.ac.uk.Prophylactic drug treatment with aspirin, statins and anti-hypertensive agentshas had a major impact on the incidence of cardiovascular disease and is now wellestablished. Progress in therapeutic cancer prevention has been much slower; onlyrecently have effective agents been clearly established. Breast cancer has ledthe way and endocrine agents used to treat it-notably tamoxifen and the aromataseinhibitors-have now been shown to have a substantial preventive effect as well.However, these agents carry some toxicity and thus identifying high-risk womenwho are likely to benefit most is a key priority. In contrast, the ability oflow-dose aspirin to prevent about one-third of colorectal, gastric, andoesophageal cancers, combined with its much lower toxicity profile, make itattractive for a much larger proportion of the general population. Vaccinationagainst the human papilloma virus is also a preventive intervention with largebenefits for the whole population. Here I recall my involvement in theseinitiatives and offer a personal viewpoint on what has been achieved and whatremains to be done.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0039-4 PMID: 29681616
