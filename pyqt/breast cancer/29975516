[Epub ahead ofprint]Identification of a Water-Coordinating HER2 Inhibitor by Virtual Screening Using Similarity-Based Scoring.Guo J, Collins S, Miller WT, Rizzo RC.Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a validated breast cancer drugtarget for small molecule inhibitors that target the ATP-binding pocket of thekinase domain. In this work, a large-scale virtual screen was performed to anovel homology model of HER2, in a hypothesized "fully active" state, thatconsidered water-mediated interactions during the prioritization of compounds forexperimental testing. This screen led to the identification of a new inhibitorwith micro molar affinity and potency ( Kd = 7.0 μM, IC50 = 4.6 μM). Accompanyingmolecular dynamics simulations showed that inhibitor binding likely involveswater coordination through an important water-mediated network previouslyidentified in our laboratory. The predicted binding geometry also showed aremarkable overlap with the crystallographic poses for two previously reportedinhibitors of the related Chk1 kinase. Concurrent with the HER2 studies, wedeveloped formalized computational protocols that leverage solvated footprints(per-residue interaction maps that include bridging waters) to identify ligandsthat can "coordinate" or "displace" key binding site waters. Proof-of-conceptscreens targeting HIVPR and PARP1 demonstrate that molecules with high footprint overlap can be effectively identified in terms of their coordination ordisplacement patterns relative to a known reference. Overall, the proceduresdeveloped as a result of this study should be useful for researchers targetingHER2 and, more generally, for any protein in which the identification ofcompounds that exploit binding site waters is desirable.DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00524 PMID: 29975516
