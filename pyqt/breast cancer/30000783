163. Radiotherapy.Drugs and Lactation Database (LactMed) [Internet]. Bethesda (MD): NationalLibrary of Medicine (US); 2006-.Some expert opinion recommends not breastfeeding during radiotherapy treatment ofbreast cancer because the suckling effect from the infant might augment skintoxicity from radiotherapy in the treated breast(s).[1] High-dose breastradiation for the therapy of breast cancer can decrease or eliminate subsequentmilk production in the treated breast, but not the untreated breast. Medicalprofessionals sometimes advise mothers who have received breast cancer surgeryand radiation not to breastfeed; however, it appears that these concerns areunfounded. Lower radiation doses to the breast in the treatment of Hodgkinlymphoma appear to have only a minor effect on subsequent lactation success, but cranial irradiation for Hodgkin's lymphoma can reduce subsequent breastmilkproduction. Women who were treated as children for leukemia with cranialradiation often have difficulty in nursing their infants.
