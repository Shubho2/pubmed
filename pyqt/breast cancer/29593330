Here, we show that in non-small-cell lungcancer (NSCLC), casein kinase 1 alpha 1 (CK1α) suppresses tumour growth byfunctioning as an autophagy inducer to activate an autophagy-regulating,tumour-suppressive PTEN/AKT/FOXO3a/Atg7 axis. Specifically, CK1α bound theC-terminal tail of PTEN and enhanced both PTEN stability and activity bycompetitively antagonizing NEDD4-1-induced PTEN polyubiquitination and abrogatingPTEN phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting AKT activity and activatingFOXO3a-induced transcription of Atg7. Notably, blocking CK1α-inducedAtg7-dependent autophagy cooperates with oncogenic HRasV12 to initiatetumorigenesis of lung epithelial cells. An association of a CK1α-modulatedautophagic program with the anti-neoplastic activities of theCK1α/PTEN/FOXO3a/Atg7 axis was demonstrated in xenografted tumour models andhuman NSCLC specimens. This provides insights into the biological and potentiallyclinical significance of autophagy in NSCLC.DOI: 10.1038/s41556-018-0065-8 PMID: 29593330
