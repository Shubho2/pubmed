Electronic address:ramkumar.km@res.srmuniv.ac.in.Cadherin-23 is an atypical member of the cadherin superfamily, with a distinctly long extracellular domain. It has been known to be a part of the tip links of theinner ear mechanosensory hair cells. Several studies have been carried out tounderstand the role of Cadherin-23 in the hearing mechanism and defects in theCDH23 have been associated with hearing impairment resulting from defective orabsence of tip links. Recent studies have highlighted the role of Cadherin-23 in several pathological conditions, including cancer, suggesting the presence ofseveral unknown functions. Initially, it was proposed that Cadherin-23 representsa yet unspecified subtype of Cadherins; however, no other proteins with similarcharacteristics have been identified, till date. It has a unique cytoplasmicdomain that does not bear a β-catenin binding region, but has been demonstratedto mediate cell-cell adhesions. Several protein interacting partners have beenidentified for Cadherin-23 and the roles of their interactions in variouscellular mechanisms are yet to be explored. This review summarizes thecharacteristics of Cadherin-23 and its roles in several pathologies includingcancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
