Patients withbreast or ovarian cancer, who were disease-free after standard of care therapy,were enrolled and randomized to one of three arms. Arm EE received six E39inoculations; arm EE' received three E39 inoculations followed by three E39'; andarm E'E received three E39' inoculations, followed by three E39. Within each arm,the first five patients received 500 μg of peptide and the remainder received1000 μg. Patients were followed for toxicity, and immune responses were measured.This initial analysis after completion of the primary vaccination series hasconfirmed the safety of both vaccines. Immune analyses suggest incorporating the attenuated version of the peptide improves immune responses and that sequencingof E39 followed by E39' might produce the optimal immune response.TRIALREGISTRATION: NCT02019524.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
