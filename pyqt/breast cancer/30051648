[Epub ahead of print]Downregulation of MCT4 for lactate exchange promotes the cytotoxicity of NK cellsin breast carcinoma.Long Y(1), Gao Z(1), Hu X(1), Xiang F(1), Wu Z(1), Zhang J(1), Han X(1), YinL(2), Qin J(1), Lan L(3), Yin F(2), Wang Y(1)(4).Author information: (1)School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.(2)First Hospital of Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, China.(3)Tianjin Cancer Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.(4)State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, NanKai University,Tianjin, China.Monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4), a monocarboxylic acid transporter,demonstrates significantly increased expression in the majority of malignancies. We performed an experiment using BALB/C mice, and our results showed that ShMCT4 transfection or the pharmaceutic inhibition of MCT4 with 7acc1 strengthens theactivity of NK cells. The results of a calcein assay revealed that thecytotoxicity of NK cells was strengthened via inhibition of MCT4. In addition,ELISA testing showed that the content of perforin and CD107a was increased, andPCR amplification and immunoblotting revealed that the expression of NKG2D andH60 was upregulated after the inhibition of MCT4. Further, we observed anelevated pH value, decreased extracellular lactate flow, and attenuated tumorgrowth. Therefore, we concluded that the inhibition of MCT4 enhanced thecytotoxicity of NK cells by blocking lactate flux and reversing the acidifiedtumor microenvironment. In addition to these findings, we also discovered thatMCT4 depletion may have a pronounced impact on autophagy, which was surmised byobserving that the inhibition of autophagy (3MA) pulled the enhanced cytotoxicityof NK cells downwards. Together, these data suggest that the key effect of MCT4depletion on NK cells probably utilizes inductive autophagy as a compensatorymetabolic mechanism to minimize the acidic extracellular microenvironmentassociated with lactate export in tumors.© 2018 The Authors.
