Among Canadian Cancer Trials Group MA.27 participants, anastrozole and exemestane hadcomparable 5-year event-free survival. This companion study examined differences in patient-reported treatment-related symptoms (TRS) and health-related qualityof life (HRQL) among postmenopausal women randomized to anastrozole orexemestane.METHODS: MA.27 participants (N = 686, of 7576) randomized to 5 years ofanastrozole (1 mg/day, n = 371, Arm A) or exemestane (25 mg/day, n = 315, Arm E) completed the 56-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) questionnaire to assess TRS and HRQL. The FACT-ES was completed atbaseline, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.RESULTS: No significant differences in FACT-ES median scores measuring TRS andHRQL were observed between treatment arms at any time point. Change in TRS frombaseline was statistically significant at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. HRQL wasstable over time in both arms. Greater TRS burden was associated with poorer HRQL(coefficient = 0.57, p < 0.001). Twenty percent of patients discontinued AItherapy by month 24 and 32% discontinued AIs at 4 years. In both arms, patientsreporting more side effect bother prior to initiating study treatment had ahigher risk of discontinuing treatment before completing protocol therapy (hazardratio [HR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.08-1.55, p = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: TRS and HRQL were comparable between anastrozole and exemestane. TRSnegatively affect HRQL. Women who report being bothered by treatment side effectsprior to initiating an AI are at increased risk for early treatmentdiscontinuation.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4713-2 PMID: 29455298
