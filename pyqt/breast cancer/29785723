After 2 weeks,adherent 1 g-control and adherent RPM cells (AD) as well as multicellularspheroids (MCS) were harvested. AD and MCS had been exposed to the RPM in thesame culture flask. In a subsequent proteome analysis, the majority of theproteins detected showed similar label-free quantification (LFQ) scores in eachof the respective subpopulations, but in both AD or MCS cultures, proteins werealso found whose LFQs deviated at least twofold from their counterparts in the 1 g-control cells. They included the cell junction protein E-cadherin, which wasdiminished in MCS cells, where proteins of the E-cadherin autodegradation pathwaywere enhanced and c-Src (proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase c-Src) wasdetected. Spheroid formation was prevented by inhibition of c-Src but promoted byantibodies blocking E-cadherin activity. An interaction analysis of the detected proteins that are involved in forming and regulating junctions or adhesioncomplexes and in E-cadherin autodegradation indicated connections between the twoprotein groups. This suggests that the balance of proteins that up- ordownregulate E-cadherin mediates the tendency of MCF7 cells to form MCS duringRPM exposure.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
