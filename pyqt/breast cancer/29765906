Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and humanpapillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common oncoviruses worldwide. Currently, it is well established that onco-proteins of EBV (LMP1, LMP2A, and EBNA1) andhigh-risk HPVs (E5 and E6/E7) play an important role in the initiation and/orprogression of several human carcinomas, including cervical, oral, and breast.More significantly, it has been recently pointed out that viral onco-proteins of EBV and high-risk HPVs can be co-present and consequently cooperate to initiateand/or amplify epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is the hallmark of cancer progression and metastasis. This could occur by Î²-catenin, JAK/STAT/SRC,PI3k/Akt/mTOR, and/or RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathways, which onco-proteins of EBV and HPVs share. This review presents the most recent advances related to EBV and high-risk HPVs onco-proteins interactions and their roles in the progression ofhuman carcinomas especially oral and breast via the initiation of EMT.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00111 PMCID: PMC5938391PMID: 29765906
