The text information extraction system (TIES) is an end-to-endapplication leveraging natural language processing technologies and focused onthe processing of pathology and/or radiology reports.Methods: We deployed the TIES system and integrated SPRs into the TIES system on a daily basis at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. The breast cancer casesdiagnosed in December 2013 from the Cancer Registry (CANREG) were used tovalidate the performance of the TIES system. The National Cancer InstituteMetathesaurus (NCIM) concept terms and codes to describe breast cancer wereidentified through the Unified Medical Language System Terminology Service (UTS) application. The identified NCIM codes were used to search for the coded SPRs in the back-end datastore directly. The identified cases were then compared with thebreast cancer patients pulled from CANREG.Results: A total of 437 breast cancer concept terms and 14 combinations of"breast"and "cancer" terms were identified from the UTS application. A total of249 breast cancer cases diagnosed in December 2013 was pulled from CANREG. Out ofthese 249 cases, 241 were successfully identified by the TIES system from a totalof 457 reports. The TIES system also identified an additional 277 cases that werenot part of the validation sample. Out of the 277 cases, 11% were determined ashighly likely to be cases after manual examinations, and 86% were in CANREG butwere diagnosed in months other than December of 2013.Conclusions: The study demonstrated that the TIES system can effectively identifypotential breast cancer cases in our care setting. Identified potential cases canbe easily confirmed by reviewing the corresponding annotated reports through the front-end visualization interface. The TIES system is a great tool foridentifying potential various cancer cases in a timely manner and on a regularbasis in support of clinical research studies.DOI: 10.4103/jpi.jpi_55_17 PMCID: PMC5760847PMID: 29416911
