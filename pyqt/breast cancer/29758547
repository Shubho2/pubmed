Electronicaddress: shuminwang2014@163.com.To improve the non-invasive therapeutic efficacy for ER positive breast cancer(ER+ BC), we fabricated a multifunctional FOXA1 loaded porphyrin microbubble tocombine photodynamic therapy (PDT) and gene therapy of FOXA1 knockdown (KD) with ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) technology under the guidance of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Cationic porphyrin microbubbles (CpMBs)were firstly fabricated from a porphyrin grafted lipid with two cationic aminogroups (PGL-NH2) and fluorocarbon inert gas of C3F8. Porphyrin group in the CpMBsmonolayer could be used as a photosensitizer for PDT, while amino groups couldadsorb siRNA through electrostatic interaction for FOXA1 KD, which could inhibit the proliferation of estrogen-dependent ER+ BC. This system showed highphotosensitizer and gene loading content. Moreover, CpMBs/siRNA can be converted into nanoparticles with low-frequency pulsed ultrasound (LFUS) exposure, whichincrease the transfection efficiency of siRNA (∼4 fold) and the porphyrin uptake (∼8 fold) in MCF-7 (a human breast cancer cell line, ER+) by sonoporation effect.In vivo, UTMD was performed under the guidance of CEUS, and the fluorescenceintensity of CpMBs/siRNA at the tumour site reached a peak value at 6 h afterinjection and it was retained in the following 24 h. Furthermore, there was notumour recurrence during the observation period (21 days) in the group of PDTcombined with FXOA1 KD. Compared to the PDT or FOXA1 KD alone group, thecombination of these two methods was much more efficient in inhibiting ER+ breastcancer, showing a good synergistic effect. CpMBs/siRNA combined with UTMDdramatically increased the local accumulation of porphyrin and siRNA throughultrasound-induced sonoporation effect under the guidance of CEUS, showingexcellent therapeutic effect for estrogen-dependent ER+ breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
