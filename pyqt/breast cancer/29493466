Brazil.Over the last decade, the inhibition of PLK1 has proven potent antiproliferative activity in vitro. However, the effectiveness of most synthetic targeted drugshas not translated into clinics. Herein, we investigated the in vitro effects of two second-generation PLK1 inhibitors BI 6727 and GSK461364 in breast cancer celllines as monotherapy or in combination with other drugs or ionizingradiation.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cell survival was analyzed through XTT®,clonogenicity and caspase-3 activation assays were also studied, and druginteractions analyzed through a nonlinear regression of a sigmoid dose responsemodel. Sensibilization to radiation was assessed through enhancement ratiocalculation.RESULTS: Mild effects on the viability of both cell lines tested (MCF-7 andHs578T) were observed irrespective of the PLK1 inhibitor used. Alternatively,abrogation of PLK1 significantly reduced clonogenicity while effectivelysensitized cells to ionizing radiation. Drug interactions showed dissimilarresults with antagonistic effects with any drug combination in MCF-7 and clearsynergic interactions between both PLK1 inhibitors and cisplatin, temozolomide ordoxorubicin in Hs578T, which is TP53 mutated.CONCLUSION: Targeting kinases involved in mitotic checkpoints are expected toprevent mitotic exit and enhance chemosensitization. Nonetheless, despiteoverexpressing PLK1, in our model, expressive results after its inhibition wereonly seen through clonogenic assays or when BI 6727 and GSK461364 were combinedwith ionizing radiation. Disparate responses of cell lines to drug combinations, might denote a partial reflection of the substantial differences in the vastspectrum of genetic, biological and epigenetic burden observed in breast cancer. In the near future, individual genomic/proteomic profiling will allow its furtherclassification and will consent the initiation of novel strategies for therapy.Even though the future impact of PLK1-tailored treatment still needs validation, much more pre-clinical and clinical research for this kinase is warranted.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180228155435 PMID: 29493466
