This study evaluates the impact of adding lobaplatin (L)to the TE regimen. Here, we show data from 125 patients (63 TE and 62 TELpatients). Four patients did not complete all the cycles. Two-sided P values showthat the addition of L (38.7% vs. 12.7%, P = 0.001) significantly increases therate of pCR in the breast and the axilla (TpCR) and the overall response rate(ORR; 93.5% vs. 73.0%, P = 0.003). The occurrence of grade 3-4 anemia andthrombocytopenia is higher in the TEL group (52.5% vs. 10.0% and 34.4% vs. 1.7%respectively). These results demonstrate that the addition of L to the TE regimenas neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves the TpCR and the ORR rates of TNBC but with increased side effects.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03210-2 PMCID: PMC5827032PMID: 29483583
