It is unclear whether the incisionalapproach contributes to these complications; therefore, the purpose of this studywas to compare the impact of incision type on outcomes in patients undergoingnipple-sparing mastectomy.METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing nipple-sparingmastectomy with prosthetic breast reconstruction through an inframammary foldversus a lateral radial incision. Skin and nipple perfusion as represented byfluorescence intensity, mammometric parameters, patient-reported outcomes, andclinical outcomes were analyzed and compared for the two cohorts, andmultivariable logistic regression models were performed to evaluate the effectsof covariates on outcomes.RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were studied: 55 in the inframammary fold cohortand 24 in the lateral radial cohort. The inframammary fold group hadsignificantly less fluorescence intensity to the inferior (21.9 percent versus36.9 percent; p = 0.001) and lateral portions of breast skin (23.1 percent versus40.7 percent; p = 0.003) after reconstruction. Decreased fluorescence intensitywas associated with smoking, decreased mean arterial pressure, and greaterspecimen weight. Postreconstruction breast volumes were increased overpreoperative volumes in the inframammary fold group (38.3 percent) versus thelateral radial (31.2 percent) group; however, patients with a lateral radialincision had a greater increase in satisfaction with their breasts andpsychosocial well-being.CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in patient-reported outcomes andfinal breast volumes based on the incisional approach to nipple-sparingmastectomy. These data can be used to guide providers and counsel patientsconsidering nipple-sparing mastectomy with prosthetic reconstruction.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, II.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004498 PMCID: PMC6023732 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29878989
