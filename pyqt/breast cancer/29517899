Therefore, the development of PADinhibitors has drawn significant research interest in recent years. Herein, wedescribe the development of the first photoswitchable PAD inhibitors. Thesecompounds possess an azobenzene photoswitch to optically control PAD activity.Screening of a series of inhibitors structurally similar to BB-Cl-amidineafforded compounds 1 and 2 as the most promising candidates for thelight-controlled inhibition of PAD2; the cis isomer of 1 is 10-fold more potentthan its trans isomer, whereas the trans isomer of 2 is 45-fold more potent than the corresponding cis isomer. The altered inhibitory potency uponphotoisomerization has been confirmed in a competitive activity-based proteinprofiling (ABPP) assay. Further investigations indicate that the trans isomer of 2 is an irreversible inhibitor, whereas the cis isomer acts as a competitiveinhibitor. In cells, the trans isomer of compound 1 is completely inactive,whereas the cis isomer inhibits histone H3-citrullination in a dose-dependentmanner. Taken together, 1 serves as the foundation for developingphotopharmaceuticals that can be activated at the desired tissue, using light, totreat diseases where PAD activity is dysregulated.DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00053 PMCID: PMC5910237 [Available on 2019-04-20]PMID: 29517899
