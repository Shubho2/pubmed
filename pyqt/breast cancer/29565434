CSPG4 plays an important role in tumor cell growth and survival and promotes chemo- and radiotherapy resistance, suggesting that CSPG4 is anattractive target in cancer therapy. In the present work, we applied the drugdelivery technology photochemical internalization (PCI) in combination with thenovel CSPG4-targeting immunotoxin 225.28-saporin as an efficient and specificstrategy to kill aggressive TNBC and amelanotic melanoma cells. Light-activation of the clinically relevant photosensitizer TPCS2a (fimaporfin) and 225.28-saporinwas found to act in a synergistic manner, and was superior to both PCI of saporinand PCI-no-drug (TPCS2a + light only) in three TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231,MDA-MB-435 and SUM149) and two BRAFV600E mutated malignant melanoma cell lines(Melmet 1 and Melmet 5). The cytotoxic effect was highly dependent on the lightdose and expression of CSPG4 since no enhanced cytotoxicity of PCI of225.28-saporin compared to PCI of saporin was observed in the CSPG4-negativeMCF-7 cells. The PCI of a smaller, and clinically relevant CSPG4-targeting toxin (scFvMEL-rGel) validated the CSPG4-targeting concept in vitro and induced astrong inhibition of tumor growth in the amelanotic melanoma xenograft A-375model. In conclusion, the combination of the drug delivery technology PCI andCSPG4-targeting immunotoxins is an efficient, specific and light-controlledstrategy for the elimination of aggressive cells of TNBC and malignant melanomaorigin. This study lays the foundation for further preclinical evaluation of PCI in combination with CSPG4-targeting.DOI: 10.1039/C7PP00358G PMID: 29565434  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
