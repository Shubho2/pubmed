Cancer historians have questioned why Halsted, a meticulous surgicalinvestigator, became more aggressive in his approach to breast cancer surgerywhen his own data failed to show prolonged patient survival. Joseph ColtBloodgood, one of Halsted's early surgical residents, Hopkins's head of surgical pathology, and Halsted's primary outcome data analyst, played previouslyunrecognized roles. Bloodgood was an aggressive surgeon with a "lynch law"approach to breast lesions. As a surgical pathologist, Bloodgood was irrationallyopposed to intraoperative frozen section diagnosis. Bloodgood's and Halsted'sunwavering trust in each other created an environment where shared beliefstrumped surgical reality. However, after Halsted's death, Bloodgood recognizedthat they had been wrong and spent the rest of his life trying to reverse theprogression while simultaneously "rewriting" details of his own involvement.DOI: 10.1353/bhm.2018.0006 PMID: 29681553
