Emerging evidence suggests that hypoxia can potentiallymaintain or enhance the stem cell phenotype of both normal stem cells and cancer cells. However, it remains to be determined whether cell fate is regulated invivo by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME).METHODS: We established a hypoxia-sensing xenograft model to identify hypoxictumor cell in vivo primarily using human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF7. Hypoxic tumor cells were identified in situ by fluorescence of greenfluorescence protein. They were further isolated from xenografts, purified andsorted by flow cytometry for detailed analysis of their stem cellcharacteristics.RESULTS: We have found that hypoxic tumor cells freshly isolated from xenografts contain increased subpopulations of tumor cells with cancer stem cell (CSC)-like characteristics. The CSC characteristics of the hypoxic tumor cells are furtherenhanced upon re-implantation in vivo, whereas secondary xenografts derived from the non-hypoxic tumor cells remain similar to the primary xenografts.Interestingly, the phenotypes exhibited by the hypoxic tumor cells are stable andremain distinctively different from those of the non-hypoxic tumor cells isolatedfrom the same tumor mass even when they are maintained under the same ambientculture conditions. Mechanistically, the PI3K/AKT pathway is strongly potentiatedin the hypoxic tumor cells and is required to maintain the CSC-like phenotype.Importantly, the differential cell fates between hypoxic and non-hypoxic tumorcells are only found in tumor cells isolated from the hypoxic TME in vivo and arenot seen in tumor cells treated by hypoxia in vitro alone.CONCLUSIONS: These previously unknown observations suggest that the hypoxic TMEmay promote malignant progression and therapy resistance by coordinatinginduction, selection and/or preferential maintenance of the CSC-like phenotype intumor cells.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0944-8 PMCID: PMC5840770PMID: 29510720
