Kelly.Phillips@petermac.org.BACKGROUND: Management advice for women with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is hampered by the lack of accurate personalised risk estimates for subsequentinvasive breast cancer (BC). Prospective validation of the only tool thatestimates individual BC risk for a woman with LCIS, the International BreastCancer Intervention Study Risk Evaluation Tool (IBIS-RET), is lacking.METHODS: Using population-based cancer registry data for 732 women with LCIS, thecalibration and discrimination accuracy of IBIS-RET Version 7.2 were assessed.RESULTS: The mean observed 10-year risk of invasive BC was 14.1% (95%CI:11.3%-17.5%). IBIS-RET overestimated invasive BC risk (p = 0.0003) anddemonstrated poor discriminatory accuracy (AUC 0.54, 95% CI: 0.48 - 0.62).CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should understand that IBIS-RET Version 7.2 mayoverestimate 10-year invasive BC risk for Australian women with LCIS. The newerIBIS-RET Version 8.0, released September 2017, includes mammographic density and may perform better, but validation is needed.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0120-z PMID: 29925933
