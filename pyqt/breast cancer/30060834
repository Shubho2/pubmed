Electronic address: Rebecca.cook@vanderbilt.edu.Chemotherapy is the most commonly prescribed treatment for patients withaggressive and lethal triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which often developchemoresistance. A recent study combined single nucleus sequencing, single cellRNA sequencing, and evolutionary biology to understand how tumor cells usegenetic and phenotypic diversity to evade the selective pressures of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
