Molecular information can help in classifying cancer subtypes and in providing clinicians with novel targetedtherapeutic opportunities. In this regard, classification of breast cancer intointrinsic subtypes based on molecular profiling represents a valuable prototype. The High Mobility Group A (HMGA) chromatin architectural factors (HMGA1a, HMGA1b,and HMGA2) have a relevant and causal role in breast cancer onset anddevelopment, by influencing virtually all cancer hallmarks. The regulation ofHMGA expression is under the control of major pathways involved in cellproliferation and survival, as well as in other cancer-related processes, therebysuggesting, for the HMGA members, a high degree of homology and overlappingactivities. Despite of this evidence, HMGA proteins display also specificfunctions. In this review, we provide an overview of (i) the pathways involved inHMGA transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, (ii) the utilization ofHMGA as molecular markers, and (iii) the biological role of HMGA in the contextof breast cancer. We focus on the potential significance of HMGA in governing theonset and development of this tumour, as well as on the potential of thesefactors as novel specific targets for preventing and treating strategies. Theemerging picture is a highly interconnected triad of proteins that could mutuallyinfluence each other, either in a competitive or cooperative manner, and that, inour opinion, should be considered as a unified and integrated protein system.Copyright Â© 2018.
