Epub 2018 Jan 8.BRCA1 mutation spectrum, functions, and therapeutic strategies: The story so far.Sharma B(1), Preet Kaur R(1), Raut S(1), Munshi A(2).Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Central University ofPunjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India.(2)Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Central University ofPunjab, Bathinda, Punjab, India. Electronic address: anjanadurani@yahoo.co.in.BRCA1 gene mutations account for about 25-28% of hereditary Breast Cancer asBRCA1 is included in the category of high penetrance genes. Except for fewcommonmutations, there is a heterogenous spectrum of BRCA1 mutations in variousethnic groups. 185AGdel and 5382ins Care the most common BRCA1 alterations(founder mutations) which have been identified in most of the population. Thisreview has been compiled with an aim to consolidate the information on geneticvariants reported in BRCA1 found in various ethnic groups, their functionalimplications if known; involvement of BRCA1 in various cellularpathways/processes and potential BRCA1 targeted therapies. The pathologicalvariations of BRCA1 vary among different ethical groups. A systematic search inPubMed and Google scholar for the literature on BRCA1 gene was carried out tofigure out structure and function of BRCA1 gene. BRCA1 is a large protein having 1863 amino acids with multiple functional domains and interacts with multipleproteins to carry out various crucial cellular processes. BRCA1 plays a majorrole in maintaining genome integrity, transcription regulation, chromatinremodeling, cell cycle checkpoint control, DNA damage repair, chromosomalsegregation, and apoptosis. Studies investigating the phenotypic response ofmutant BRCA1 protein and comparing it to wildtype BRCA1 protein are clinicallyimportant as they are involved in homologous recombination and other repairmechanisms. These studies may help in developing more targetted therapies,detecting novel interacting partners, identification of new signaling pathwaysthat BRCA1 is a part of or downstream target genes that BRCA1 affects.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
