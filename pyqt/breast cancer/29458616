The SLN were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry(DSC), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Small Angle X-ray Diffraction (SAXS), in vitrorelease, transmission electron microscopy, and polarized light microscopy.Evaluation of cell viability was performed in two cell cultures: MCF-7 (humanbreast cancer) and 4T1 (murine breast cancer). The SLN showed a size in the rangeof 128 nm, negative zeta potential, DOX encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 99%, anddrug loading (DL) of 66 mg/g. Characterization of the formulation by DSC, XRD,and SAXS revealed the presence of DOX inside the nanoparticles of SLN andsuggested increased expulsion/release of this drug when associated with SC. Therelease profiles revealed that the SLN-DOX-SC showed controlled release of DOX atpH 7.4 with enhanced drug release at low pH, useful for cancer treatment. TheSLN-DOX-SC demonstrated to be more effective than the free DOX against 4T1 cells.So, the developed SLN efficiently encapsulate DOX and SC and show good potential as an alternative for cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1166/jnn.2018.15418 PMID: 29458616  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
