Demographic, clinical and reproductiveinformation were collected. Fertility and parenthood attitudes and decisions wereassessed through a self-report questionnaire devised specifically for the study.RESULTS: Fertility issues became very important after the diagnosis for most ofthe women (51%). Few differences existed between USA and Portuguese participants.USA participants were more likely to undergo FP (23% USA vs Portugal 5%,p = 0.01). Portuguese women were more dissatisfied with their physician'sexplanations about fertility (Portugal: 23% vs USA: 3%; p = 0.01). Overall, womenrelied on their oncologist for fertility information (70%); only Portuguese womendiscussed fertility with their family medicine physician (11%). Overall, womenshowed positive attitudes towards motherhood. Portuguese women were more likelyto report their partners placed more value on the family after their illness(Portuguese agree: 55% vs USA agree: 14%; p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Fertility and childbearing after breast cancer are important issues regardless of culture, background or country's heath care system. Overall, fewdifferences across the USA and Portuguese samples were found on fertility andchildbearing attitudes and decisions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
