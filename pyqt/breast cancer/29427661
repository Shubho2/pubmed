However, the role of miR-199a-5p in the progression of PTC andthe underlying mechanism remain to be further addressed.METHODS: miR-199a-5p and snail family zinc finger 1 (SNAI1) mRNA expressions inPTC tissues and cells were detected by qRT-PCR. The effects of miR-199a-5p andSNAI1 on cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)were evaluated by cell migration and invasion assays, and western blot,respectively. The relationship between miR-199a-5p and SNAI1 was investigated by luciferase reporter assay and western blot. Xenograft tumor assay was performedto verify the role of miR-199a-5p and molecular mechanism in PTC.RESULTS: miR-199a-5p expression was significantly downregulated and SNAI1 wasmarkedly upregulated in PTC tissues and cells. miR-199a-5p overexpression andSNAI1 knockdown suppressed the progression of PTC cells in vitro, as evidenced bythe reduced cell migration, invasion and EMT. Of note, SNAI1 was identified as a target of miR-199a-5p and miR-199a-5p suppressed SNAI1 expression in PTC cells.Xenograft tumor assay proved that miR-199a-5p overexpression suppressed tumorgrowth in PTC in vivo by downregulating SNAI1.CONCLUSION: miR-199a-5p inhibited the progression of PTC by downregulating SNAI1,offering new insight into the molecular mechanism underlying PTC progression.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
