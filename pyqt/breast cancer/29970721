However, the studies on this topic are limited. Becausemultiple agent chemotherapy is not a common treatment option, it is hard toestablish controlled study groups (as before chemotherapy and afterchemotherapy); further, cancer, itself, may cause cardiac side effects anduncertainty of the symptoms may be associated with previous clinical situationbefore chemotherapy. For all that, we may get information to a certain degreeabout the side effects of these agents by analyzing case reports. These sideeffects have a broad spectrum from asymptomatic rhythm alterations to acutecardiac death. In this case report, we aim to discuss asymptomatic ventricularbigeminal rhythm, which is proved by electrocardiography, of our patient duringtreated by trastuzumab.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.183557 PMID: 29970721
