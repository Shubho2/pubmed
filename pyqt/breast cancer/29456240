Thus, targeting STAT3 promises to be an attractivestrategy for the treatment of advanced metastatic tumors. Bisindolylmaleimidealkaloid (BMA) has been shown to have anti-cancer activities and was thought tosuppress tumor cell growth by inhibiting protein kinase C. In this study, we showthat a newly synthesized BMA analog, BMA097, is effective in suppressing tumorcell and xenograft growth and in inducing spontaneous apoptosis. We also provide evidence that BMA097 binds directly to the SH2 domain of STAT3 and inhibits STAT3phosphorylation and activation, leading to reduced expression of STAT3 downstreamtarget genes. Structure activity relationship analysis revealed that thehydroxymethyl group in the 2,5-dihydropyrrole-2,5-dione prohibits STAT3inhibitory activity of BMA analogs. Altogether, we conclude that the syntheticBMA analogs may be developed as anti-cancer drugs by targeting and binding to theSH2 domain of STAT3 and inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-017-0076-0 PMCID: PMC5934316 [Available on 2018-08-19]PMID: 29456240
