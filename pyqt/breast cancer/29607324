We evaluated how MBD relates to breast cancercharacteristics in Kenyan women undergoing diagnostic mammography.Methods: This cross-sectional study included women with pathologically confirmed breast cancers (n = 123). Pretreatment mammograms of the unaffected breast wereassessed to estimate absolute dense area (cm2), nondense area (cm2), and percent density (PD). Relationships between density measurements and clinicalcharacteristics were evaluated using analysis of covariance.Results: Median PD and dense area were 24.9% and 85.3 cm2. Higher PD and densearea were observed in younger women (P < 0.01). Higher dense and nondense areaswere observed in obese women (P-trend < 0.01). Estrogen receptor (ER) positivepatients (73%) had higher PD and dense area than ER-negative patients (P ≤ 0.02).Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients (17%) had lower PD and dense area(P ≤ 0.01) compared with non-TNBCs. No associations were observed between MBD andtumor size and grade.Conclusions: Our findings show discordant relationships between MBD and moleculartumor subtypes to those previously observed in Western populations. Therelatively low breast density observed at diagnosis may have importantimplications for cancer prevention initiatives in Kenya. Subsequent largerstudies are needed to confirm these findings.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6026315 PMCID: PMC5828539PMID: 29607324
