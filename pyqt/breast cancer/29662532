Self-perception of cosmesis, changes in the treated breast, pain andfractionation used (hypofractionation (HF) 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions orconventional fractionation (CF) 50 Gy in 25 fractions) were evaluated.Results: Three hundred and fifty-two questionnaires were obtained. The median agewas 58 years. 45% of patients reported 'excellent' cosmesis, 53% 'good', and 2%'poor' cosmesis. Cosmesis was considered 'excellent/good' by 98% of patients. No statistically significant difference was found in overall cosmesis according tofractionation received (p = 0.6).The most frequent alteration was 'differencebetween both breasts' (77%), and 48% reported change in normal breastcolour.Fifteen percent of patients who are younger than 58 years reported achange of normal breast colour affecting cosmesis compared to 9% of patientsolder than 58 years (p = 0.04).Complications affecting breast cosmesis werereported by 9% of patients with stages I-II compared with 2% with cancer in situ (DCIS) (p = 0.04); 14% in stages I-II referred colour change affecting cosmesiscompared to 6% of those with DCIS (p = 0.03).Ninety-four percent of patientsstated that they would accept treatment again.Conclusions: No difference in cosmetic results was found between HF and CF in ourpatients. Great satisfaction regarding cosmetic outcome of cancer treatment wasreported, given by 98% of excellent/good cosmesis, and 94% of patients who would receive treatment again.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.819 PMCID: PMC5880232PMID: 29662532
