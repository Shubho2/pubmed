However, many such studies arehampered by poor response rates in completion of study questionnaires, thuslimiting the generalizability of any findings. The objectives of this analysiswere to identify independent variables associated with nonresponse to surveysfollowing breast reconstruction to improve future patient-reported outcomesresearch.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium is aprospective cohort study involving 11 leading medical centers from the UnitedStates and Canada. Nonresponse rates for surveys assessing satisfaction withbreast, satisfaction with care (BREAST-Q), depression (Patient HealthQuestionnaire-9), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) were measured at1 y and 2 y postoperatively. Clinical complication rates were compared betweenresponders and nonresponders, and multivariable models were used to assesspredictors of nonresponse.RESULTS: Among 2856 women in the analytic cohort, 1882 (65.9%) underwentimplant-based, 817 (28.6%) received autologous, and 157 (5.5%) underwentlatissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap breast reconstructions. Nonresponse rates tosurveys at 1 y and 2 y were 27.8% and 34.4%, respectively. Race, ethnicity, andannual household income were associated with nonresponse to surveys. Women whounderwent implant-based procedures were less likely to complete long-termsurveys.CONCLUSIONS: As survey-based research plays an increasingly prominent role inevaluating the outcomes of breast reconstruction, we found socioeconomic andprocedure-related differences in survey response rates. Investigators mustconsider systematic differences in response rates among particular groups ofwomen on the generalizability and validity of findings and perform rigorousnonresponse bias analyses.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
