Localised vibration tagging(LOVIT) retrieves OA signal from images that are acquired with and without apreceding ultrasonic pushing beam: Radiation force leads to a phase shift ofsignals coming from the focal area resulting in their visibility in a difference image, whereas clutter from outside the pushing beam is eliminated. Disadvantagesof a single-focus approach are residual clutter from inside the pushing beamabove the focus, and time-intensive scanning of the focus to retrieve a largefield-of-view. To speed up acquisition, we propose to create multiple foci inparallel, forming comb-shaped ARF patterns. By subtracting OA images obtainedwith interleaved combs, this technique moreover results in greatly improvedclutter reduction in phantoms mimicking optical, acoustic and elastic properties of breast tissue.DOI: 10.1016/j.pacs.2018.02.001 PMCID: PMC5945922PMID: 29755937
