A total of 28 breast cancer patients who underwent breast-conservingsurgery were enrolled in this study. All the patients had received 50.4 Gy ofconventional whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and underwent re-sim CT scans fortumor bed boost. For evaluation of dosimetric shifts between initial and re-simCT scans, electron boost plans in the same field size with the same monitor unit with source-to-skin distance of 100 cm were conducted. Dosimetric parameters(V105%, V103%, V100%, V98%, V95%, V90%: Vx% indicates volumes which receive X% ofprescribed doses) between initial and re-sim CT scans were compared. The CTnumber data (CTmean, CTmax, CTmin) of the original and irradiated CT (re-sim CT) scans from each representative structure (lung, rib bone, soft tissue, muscle,etc.) were examined and recruited. CT numbers showed highly variable changes.Soft tissue CTmean and muscle CTmax/CTmin showed statistically and significantly increased values in the CT (re-sim CT) compared to the original CT scans. Ribbone CTmean/CTmin showed statistically and significantly decreased values in the re-sim CT compared to the original CT scans. Other CT number values showed nostatistically significant changes. Among the dosimetric parameters, only V105%(p = 0.015, mean = 3.07 cc versus 1.63 cc) and V103% (p = 0.017, mean = 13.8 ccversus 11.9 cc) exhibited statistically increased values in the re-sim CTcompared to the original CT scans. CT number changes after conventional WBI were different according to tissue component. For electron boost plans, theimplementation of a re-sim CT might be helpfully considered because significantdosimetric factor changes were observed especially in the high-dose areas (hotspots: V105% and V103%).DOI: 10.1177/1010428318791882 PMID: 30091675
