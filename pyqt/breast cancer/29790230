[Epub ahead of print]Visualizing the quantile survival time difference curve.Heinzl H(1), Mittlboeck M.Author information: (1)Section for Clinical Biometrics, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics,and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.The difference between the pth quantiles of 2 survival functions can be used tocompare patients' survival between 2 therapies. Setting p = 0.5 yields the mediansurvival time difference. Varying p between 0 and 1 defines the quantile survivaltime difference curve which can be straightforwardly estimated by the horizontal differences between 2 Kaplan-Meier curves. The estimate's variability can bevisualized by adding either a bundle of resampled bootstrap step functions or,alternatively, approximate bootstrap confidence bands. The user-friendly SASsoftware macro %kmdiff enables the straightforward application of thisexploratory graphical approach. The macro is described, and its application isexemplified with breast cancer data. The advantages and limitations of theapproach are discussed.© 2018 The Authors Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice Published by JohnWiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/jep.12948 PMID: 29790230
