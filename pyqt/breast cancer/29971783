However, some dietary behaviors are not currently recommended forpatients without medical supervision. This study aimed at evaluating weight-loss restrictive diets and fasting practices among cancer survivors of theNutriNet-Santé cohort, as well as related sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.In October 2016, 2,741 cancer survivors had completed a specific questionnaireabout their practices. Fasting and non-fasting patients (respectively dieting andnon-dieting) were compared using logistic regression models. Analyses wereweighted according to the age, sex, and cancer location distribution of Frenchcancer cases. 13.8% had already practiced weight-loss restrictive diet sincetheir diagnosis. They were more likely to be women, professionally active,overweight/obese, to use dietary supplements and to have breast cancer (allp<0.05). 6.0% had already fasted, 3.5% since their diagnosis. They were morelikely to be younger, with higher educational level, higher incomes,professionally active, to have a healthy weight, and to use dietary supplements(all p<0.05). Fasting was associated with the opinion that such practice couldimprove cancer prognosis (p<0.0001). Patients who received nutritionalinformation from health care professionals were less likely to practice fastingor weight-loss restrictive diet (0.42[0.27-0.66], p<0.0001 and 0.49[0.38-0.64],p<0.0001 respectively). This study provided original results suggesting thatweight-loss restrictive diets are widely practiced by cancer survivors. Fastingwas less common in this study though non negligible. Sources of nutritionalinformation received since cancer diagnosis seemed to be a key determinant ofthese practices. This article is protected by copyright.
