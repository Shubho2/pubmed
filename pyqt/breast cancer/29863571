Accurate andtimely diagnosis may be challenging because myeloid sarcoma is known to mimicsolid tumors, including hepatobiliary, nasopharyngeal, and breast carcinomas. We report a case of myeloid sarcoma that developed in the primary tumor lymphaticdrainage field of a previously treated intermediate-thickness cutaneous melanoma,clinically and radiographically mimicking an in-transit metastasis, in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome. The diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma was achievedafter surgical excision of the mass and pathological examination that includedextensive immunohistochemical studies. Awareness of such an unusual clinicalpresentation can help reduce diagnostic delay and ensure that adequate tissue is obtained for pathological examination and ancillary studies that are critical foraccurate diagnosis and appropriate patient management.DOI: 10.1097/DAD.0000000000001150 PMID: 29863571
