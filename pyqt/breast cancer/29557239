Methods Thestudy enrolled patients with clinical breast masses who were examined using MRIat eight different echo times. The differences in T2 relaxation time of benignand malignant breast lesions were analysed. Results A total of 67 patients (67breast lesions: 46 malignant, 21 benign) were examined. The mean ± SD T2relaxation time was significantly lower in the 46 malignant lesions compared withthe 21 benign lesions (82.69 ± 15.37 ms versus 95.48 ± 26.51 ms, respectively).The area under the curve was 0.731. Using 79.52 ms as the cut-off between benign and malignant breast lesions, a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 58.7%were obtained. Conclusions There was a significant difference in T2 relaxationtime between benign and malignant breast lesions. The specificity of using T2relaxation time alone for the differentiation of benign from malignant lesionswas not high, but it could constitute a new adjunct in the MRI diagnosis ofbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1177/0300060517721071 PMCID: PMC5991255PMID: 29557239
