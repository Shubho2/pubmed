However, the potential effect of prostratin on cancer is yet to be defined. As CXCR4 iswell known to induce cancer migration, it was hypothesized that prostratininduces an anti-cancer effect through inhibition of CXCR4 expression. The authorspreviously demonstrated that high stimulating conditions (sub-minimal IL-17, 0.1 ng/ml, synergized with high salt, Δ0.05 M NaCl) promote breast cancer cellproliferation and CXCR4 expression through upregulation of salt-inducible kinase (SIK)-3. The present study demonstrated that prostratin selectively exertedincreased cytotoxicity (IC50 of 7 µM) when breast cancer cells were cultured inhigh stimulating conditions, compared with regular basal culture conditions (IC50of 35 µM). Furthermore, the cytotoxic potential of prostratin was increasedseven-fold in the four breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, BT-20 andAU-565) compared with the non-malignant MCF10A breast epithelial cell line. This suggested that prostratin specifically targets cancer cells over normal cells.Mechanistic studies revealed that prostratin inhibited CXCR4 expression in breastcancer cells through downregulation of SIK3 expression. Overall, the data suggestthat prostratin is a novel drug target for the pro-oncogenic factor SIK3. Thesestudies could form a basis for further research to evaluate the anticancer effectof prostratin in a combinatorial chemotherapeutic regimen.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7674 PMCID: PMC5778866PMID: 29435066
