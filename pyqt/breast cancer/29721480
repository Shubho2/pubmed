Traditionally,axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been used for determining the status ofthe axillary lymph nodes. More recently the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)procedure has gained wider acceptance as the standard of care, having theadvantage of being less invasivewhile providing good accuracy. This expert group used data from published literature, practical experience and opinion of a large group of academic oncologists to arrive at these practical consensusrecommendations in regards with the use of the two different procedures and otherissues in patients with early breast cancer for the benefit of communityoncologists.DOI: 10.4103/sajc.sajc_120_18 PMCID: PMC5909291PMID: 29721480
