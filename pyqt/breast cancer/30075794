However,mammography is currently added from the age of 30 without proven benefits. Thepurpose of this study is to investigate the added cancer detection of mammographywhen breast MRI is available, focusing on the value in women with and withoutBRCA mutation, and in the age groups above and below 50 years.METHODS: This retrospective single-center study evaluated 6553 screening roundsin 2026 women at increased risk of breast cancer (1 January 2003 to 1 January2014). Risk category (BRCA mutation versus others at increased risk of breastcancer), age at examination, recall, biopsy, and histopathological diagnosis wererecorded. Cancer yield, false positive recall rate (FPR), and false positivebiopsy rate (FPB) were calculated using generalized estimating equations forseparate age categories (< 40, 40-50, 50-60, ≥ 60 years). Numbers of screensneeded to detect an additional breast cancer with mammography (NSN) werecalculated for the subgroups.RESULTS: Of a total of 125 screen-detected breast cancers, 112 were detected byMRI and 66 by mammography: 13 cancers were solely detected by mammography,including 8 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ. In BRCA mutation carriers, 3 of 61cancers were detected only on mammography, while in other women 10 of 64 caseswere detected with mammography alone. While 77% of mammography-detected-onlycancers were detected in women ≥ 50 years of age, mammography also added more to the FPR in these women. Below 50 years the number of mammographic examinationsneeded to find an MRI-occult cancer was 1427.CONCLUSIONS: Mammography is of limited added value in terms of cancer detectionwhen breast MRI is available for women of all ages who are at increased risk.While the benefit appears slightly larger in women over 50 years of age withoutBRCA mutation, there is also a substantial increase in false positive findings inthese women.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1019-6 PMID: 30075794
