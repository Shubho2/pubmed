However, in cancer MASTL is most commonly amplified andoverexpressed. This correlates with increased chromosome instability in breastcancer and poor patient survival in breast, ovarian and lung cancer. Globalphosphoproteomic analysis of immortalised breast MCF10A cells engineered tooverexpressed MASTL revealed disruption to desmosomes, actin cytoskeleton,PI3K/AKT/mTOR and p38 stress kinase signalling pathways. Notably, these pathways were also disrupted in patient samples that overexpress MASTL. In MCF10A cells,these alterations corresponded with a loss of contact inhibition and partialepithelial-mesenchymal transition, which disrupted migration and allowed cells toproliferate uncontrollably in 3D culture. Furthermore, MASTL overexpressionincreased aberrant mitotic divisions resulting in increased micronucleiformation. Mathematical modelling indicated that this delay was due to continued inhibition of PP2A-B55, which delayed timely mitotic exit. This corresponded withan increase in DNA damage and delayed transit through interphase. There were nosignificant alterations to replication kinetics upon MASTL overexpression,however, inhibition of p38 kinase rescued the interphase delay, suggesting thedelay was a G2 DNA damage checkpoint response. Importantly, knockdown of MASTL,reduced cell proliferation, prevented invasion and metastasis of MDA-MB-231breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, indicating the potential of futuretherapies that target MASTL. Taken together, these results suggest that MASTLoverexpression contributes to chromosome instability and metastasis, therebydecreasing breast cancer patient survival.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0295-z PMID: 29743597
