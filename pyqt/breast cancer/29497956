Visual analysis was used to assessprimary breast lesion, axillary lymph node, and distant metastasis. Thetumor-blood (T/B) ratios from [99mTc]3PRGD2 imaging and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) from [18F]FDG imaging were analyzed for breast lesions.Integrin αvβ3 was analyzed through immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: Forty-five breast lesions were found (malignant, n = 38; benign, n = 7).The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of [99mTc]3PRGD2 and [18F]FDG imaging in visual analysis for the breast lesion were 97.4, 87.5, and 95.6 % and 97.4,71.4, and 93.3 %, respectively (P > 0.05). For semi-quantitative analysis, nosignificant difference of the area under the curves (AUC) was found in theimaging using the two radiopharmaceuticals (0.880 and 0.955; Z = 0.88, P > 0.05).The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for axillary lymph node metastasiswith [99mTc]3PRGD2 and [18F]FDG were 78.05, 99.36, and 94.92 % and 85.37, 98.72, and 95.64 %, respectively (P > 0.05). Nine patients with distant metastases were all detected with the two radiopharmaceuticals. The expression of integrin αvβ3was correlated with [99mTc]3PRGD2 uptake (r = 0.582, P = 0.001), which weresignificantly higher in the HER2-positive and stage III-IV patients (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The prospective study demonstrated that [99mTc]3PRGD2 imaging seems to be valuable for diagnosis of breast cancer and its staging. It may be lesssensitive for detecting small lymph node metastatic lesions when compared with[18F]FDG imaging. Integrin αvβ3 in tumor microvessels was associated with thebreast cancer subtype and its staging.DOI: 10.1007/s11307-018-1178-y PMID: 29497956
