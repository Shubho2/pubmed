Molecular subtypes of breast cancer, histological grade and lymph nodemetastases are strong prognostic and predictive factors. In Indonesia, only alimited number of studies have investigated the correlation between molecularsubtypes with histological grade and lymph node metastases. Methods: We analyzed 247 invasive breast carcinoma cases from the Anatomic Pathology Installation ofDr. Sardjito General Hospital Yogyakarta between 2012-2015. The slides werestained for estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), HER2, Ki-67 andCK5/6 for classification into breast cancer subtypes (BCS). Histological gradeusing the Nottingham system and lymph node status were obtained from anatomicpathology records. The association between histological grade and lymph nodestatus with BCS was examined with Chi-square tests. Results: Theimmunohistochemical features of 247 cases of women with invasive breast carcinomawere examined. There were 102 (41.3%) patients with Luminal A, 34 (13.8%)patients with Luminal B, 48 (19.4%) patients with HER2-positive, and 63 (25.5%)patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). There were 148 (59.9%)patients with negative lymph node status and 99 (40.1%) with positive status.Among 63 TNBC cases, 37 (58.7%) patients were positive for CK5/6 staining(basal-like). Statistically, there were significant differences betweenhistological grade and subtypes (p=0.013). However, no significant differenceswere found for lymph node metastases (p=0.540). Conclusion: Among subtypes,Luminal A has the highest frequency, followed by TNBC, HER2-positive and Luminal B. Histological grade was associated with molecular subtypes of breast carcinoma in Yogyakarta. Grade I was associated with Luminal A, while Grade III wasassociated with Luminal B, HER2 and TNBC subtypes.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.5.1263 PMCID: PMC6031822PMID: 29801411
