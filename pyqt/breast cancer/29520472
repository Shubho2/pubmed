As mammographic breast density (MD) is one of the strongest risk factors for developing breast cancer, the present study investigated whether there is an association between residential exposure to traffic noise and MD in a Danishcohort.METHODS: We included women with reproductive and lifestyle information available from the Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort, who also participated in the CopenhagenMammography Screening Programme (n = 5,260). Present and historical addressesfrom 1987 to 2011 were found in national registries, and traffic noise wasmodeled 5 years before mammogram. Analyses between residential traffic noise and MD were performed using logistic regression.RESULTS: We found no association between residential road and railway noiseexposure 5 years before mammogram, and having a mixed/dense versus a fattymammogram, and no interaction with menopausal status, BMI, HRT use, and railwaynoise exposure, for analyses on road traffic noise.CONCLUSION: The present study does not suggest an association between residentialtraffic noise exposure and subsequent MD in a cohort of middle-aged Danish women.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1021-4 PMID: 29520472
