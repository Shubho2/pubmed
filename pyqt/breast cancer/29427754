Electronic address:r.pandey@cimap.res.in.The conserved EGFR pathway is linked with multiple cancers in humans includingbreast, ovarian, and lung carcinoma. Withanolide A, one of the major withanolidalactive compounds isolated from the Withania somnifera, extends lifespan andameliorates stress resistance in wild-type C. elegans by targeting theInsulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. Up-regulation of IGF1 can transactivate EGFRwhich inturn reduces longevity and promotes tumor development in an organism. We examined the effects of Withanolide A on the lifespan of a human EGFR-driven C.elegans transgenic model exhibiting the multivulva (Muv) phenotype. The resultsshowed that WA extends the lifespan of both wild human EGFR-driven C. elegansmodel (human wild-type tyrosine kinase) as well as models bearing single (L858R),and double mutations (T790M-L858R). The lifespan extension observed in thesetransgenic strains was 20.35, 24.21 and 21.27%, respectively. Moreover, thereduced fat levels were noticed in both wild-type N2 worms and transgenicstrains. These observations support the heathspan promoting effect of WA aslipid-rich diet has been reported to promote tumor development. In view of thefact that most of the well known FDA approved drugs such as gefitinib fail toinhibit the EGFR-associated cancers because of these mutations, the presentfindings show the potential of Withanolide A as a foreseen future nutraceuticalto improve the average survival of cancer patients.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
