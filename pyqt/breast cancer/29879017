On one hand several studies suggest a negative connection in colorectal cancerpatients with pre-operative thrombocytosis, on the other hand other studiescontradicts this. However, it remains unknown whether elevated platelet countsare associated with survival in colorectal cancer patients. We thereforeconducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic role of platelet countsin colorectal cancer.METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched fromtheir inception to October 15, 2016 to identify relevant studies that haveexplored the prognostic role of platelet counts in colorectal cancer. Studiesthat examined the association between platelet counts and prognoses in colorectalcancer and that provided a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) foroverall survival (OS) and/or disease-free survival (DFS) were included.RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 9 retrospective cohort studies involving3413 patients with colorectal cancer. OS was shorter in patients with elevatedplatelet counts than in patients with normal counts (HR 2.11, 95% CI: 1.68-2.65).For DFS, an elevated platelet count was also a poor predictor (HR 2.51, 95% CI:1.84-3.43).CONCLUSION: In this meta-analysis, we suggest that an elevated platelet count is a negative predictor of survival in both primary colorectal cancer and resectablecolorectal liver metastases.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010831 PMCID: PMC5999498PMID: 29879017  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
