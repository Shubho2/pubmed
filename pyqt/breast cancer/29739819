VCJordan@mdanderson.org.Estrogen therapy was used to treat advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal womenfor decades until the introduction of tamoxifen. Resistance to long-term estrogendeprivation (LTED) with tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors used as a treatment ofbreast cancer inevitably occurs, but unexpectedly low-dose estrogen can causeregression of breast cancer and increase disease-free survival in some patients. This therapeutic effect is attributed to estrogen-induced apoptosis in LTEDbreast cancer. Here, we describe modulation of the estrogen receptor (ER)liganded with antiestrogens (endoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen) and an estrogenic triphenylethylene (TPE), ethoxytriphenylethylene (EtOXTPE), on estrogen-inducedapoptosis in LTED breast cancer cells. Our results show that the angular TPEestrogen (EtOXTPE) is able to induce the ER-mediated apoptosis only at a latertime compared with planar estradiol in these cells. Using real-time polymerasechain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation, western blotting, molecularmodeling, and X-ray crystallography techniques, we report novel conformations of the ER complex with an angular estrogen EtOXTPE and endoxifen. We propose thatalteration of the conformation of the ER complexes, with changes in coactivatorbinding, governs estrogen-induced apoptosis through the protein kinase regulated by RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase sensor system to trigger an unfoldedprotein response.Copyright Â© 2018 by The Author(s).DOI: 10.1124/mol.117.111385 PMCID: PMC6022805PMID: 29739819
