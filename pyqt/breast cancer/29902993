However, whether breastcancer heterogeneity may explain the contradictory influence of triglycerides andcholesterol observed on breast cancer prognosis remains unclear.METHODS: A population-based survival study among 464 breast cancer casesidentified within the Tromsø study was conducted. Pre-diagnostic triglycerides,total-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were measured, and detailed clinical andhistopathological data were obtained. Using tissue microarray, all breast cancer cases were reclassified into the following subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B,HER2-enriched, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Multivariable Coxproportional hazards regression models were used to study the associationsbetween pre-diagnostic lipids and breast cancer recurrence, mortality, andsurvival.RESULTS: A total of 464 breast cancer patients, with mean age at diagnosis of57.9 years, were followed for a mean 8.4 years. TNBC patients in the highesttertile of triglycerides (≥ 1.23 mmol/l) had 3 times higher overall mortalitycompared to TNBC patients in the lowest tertile (≤ 0.82 mmol/l) (HR 2.99, 95% CI 1.17-7.63), and the 5-year overall survival was 19% lower for TNBC patients inthe highest vs. lowest tertile of triglycerides (65% vs. 84%). TNBC patients inthe highest tertile of the HDL-cholesterol/total-cholesterol ratio (≥0.35),compared to those in the lowest tertile (≤0.27), had a 67% reduced overallmortality risk (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.89). No associations were observed betweenlipids and prognostic outcome among breast cancer patients overall, or amongpatients with luminal A and luminal B subtypes. Among HER2-enriched patients,pre-diagnostic triglyceride level was inversely associated with overallmortality.CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that pre-diagnostic triglycerides and theHDL-cholesterol/total-cholesterol ratio may independently provide uniqueinformation regarding prognostic outcome among triple negative breast cancerpatients. However, a small sample size underlines the need for additionalstudies.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4568-2 PMCID: PMC6003110PMID: 29902993
