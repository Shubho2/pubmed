China.Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are key regulators in the development and progression ofhuman cancers; however their roles in breast tumorigenesis are not yet wellunderstood. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the expression profiles and potential modulatory effects of circRNAs on breast carcinogenesis. A humancircRNA microarray analysis was performed to screen for abnormally expressedcircRNAs in breast cancer tissue and circRNA-000911 was identified as a circRNAwhich was significantly downregulated in breast cancer cells. Mechanisticinvestigations suggested that the enhanced expression of circRNA-000911suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted the apoptosisof breast cancer cells. By using a biotin-labeled circRNA-000911 probe to performRNA precipitation in breast cancer cells, we identified miR‑449a as thecircRNA‑000911-associated microRNA. Gain- and loss-of-function assays indicatedthat miR‑449a antagonized circRNA-000911 to regulate breast cancer progression.Subsequently, Notch1 was identified as the functional target of miR‑449a, and theoverexpression of circRNA-000911 in breast cancer elevated Notch1 expression.Furthermore, Cignal Signal Transduction Reporter Array and western blot analysis identified nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling as a functional target of thecircRNA-000911/miR‑449a pathway. On the whole, our findings indicate thatcircRNA-000911 plays an anti-oncogenic role in breast cancer and may thus serveas a promising therapeutic target for patients with breast cancer. Therefore, theoverexpression of circRNA-000911 may provide a future direction which may aid in the development of a novel treatment strategy for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4265 PMCID: PMC5807038PMID: 29431182
