Additionally, it has been identified as one of the majorphysiological barriers to the effective delivery of drugs to solid tumors and itstargeting with the use of pharmaceutical agents has shown to decompress tumorblood vessels, and thus improve tumor perfusion and efficacy of cytotoxic drugs. In this study, we investigated the contribution of hyaluronan to the accumulationof mechanical forces in tumors. Using experimental data from two orthotopicbreast tumor models and treating tumors with two clinically approvedanti-fibrotic drugs (tranilast and pirfenidone), we found that accumulation ofgrowth-induced, residual forces in tumors are associated with hyaluronan content.Furthermore, mechanical characterization of the tumors revealed a goodcorrelation of the accumulated forces with the elastic modulus of the tissue. Ourresults provide important insights on the mechano-pathology of solid tumors andcan be used for the design of therapeutic strategies that target hyaluronan.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193801 PMCID: PMC5862434PMID: 29561855  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
