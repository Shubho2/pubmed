Diagnostic performance of US-FNA for ALN recurrence were evaluated.RESULTS: Of the 231 US-FNA examinations, 172 (74.5%) obtained negative and 59(25.5%) obtained positive cytological results. All US-FNA-negative axillarylesions were considered imaging-cytology concordant and underwent follow-up, withone false-negative result (false negative rate, 1.6% [1/60]). The overallsensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of US-FNA for diagnosing ALNrecurrence/metastasis per examination were 98.3% (59/60), 100% (171/171), 100%(59/59) and 99.4% (171/172). When excluding nine patients with newly developedcontralateral breast cancer, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of US-FNA for diagnosing ALN recurrence was 98.1% (51/52),100% (170/170),100% (51/51) and99.4% (170/171).CONCLUSIONS: US-FNA is a reliable method for diagnosing axillary recurrence inpatients with a history of breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
