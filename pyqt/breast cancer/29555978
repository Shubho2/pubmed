Surprisingly, upon knock-down of Sema4C or its receptor PlexinB2in diverse mammary carcinoma cells (but not their normal counterparts), weobserved dramatic growth inhibition associated with impairment of G2/M phasetransition, cytokinesis defects and the onset of cell senescence.Mechanistically, we demonstrated a Sema4C/PlexinB2/LARG-dependent signalingcascade that is required to maintain critical RhoA-GTP levels in cancer cells.Interestingly, we also found that Sema4C upregulation in luminal-type breastcancer cells drives a dramatic phenotypic change, with disassembly of polaritycomplexes, mitotic spindle misorientation, cell-cell dissociation and increasedmigration and invasiveness. We found that this signaling cascade is dependent on the PlexinB2 effectors ErbB2 and RhoA-dependent kinases. Moreover,Sema4C-overexpressing luminal breast cancer cells upregulated the transcriptionfactors Snail, Slug and SOX-2, and formed estrogen-independent metastatic tumors in mice. In sum, our data indicate that Sema4C/PlexinB2 signaling is essentialfor the growth of breast carcinoma cells, featuring a novel potential therapeutictarget. In addition, elevated Sema4C expression enables indolent luminal-typetumors to become resistant to estrogen deprivation, invasive and metastatic invivo, which could account for its association with a subset of human breastcancers with poor prognosis.DOI: 10.1038/s41418-018-0097-4 PMCID: PMC6030176 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29555978
