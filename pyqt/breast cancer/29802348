Changes in Zn2+ accumulation anddistribution are associated with tamoxifen-resistance and breast cancerprogression. The Zn2+-sensing G-protein coupled receptor, ZnR/GPR39, triggerssignaling leading to cell growth, but a role for this receptor in breast cancerin unknown. Using fluorescence imaging, we found Zn2+-dependent Ca2+ release,mediated by ZnR/GPR39 activity, in TAMR tamoxifen-resistant cells derived fromMCF-7 cells, but not in ER-expressing MCF-7 or T47D cells. Furthermore, ZnR/GPR39signaling was monitored in ER negative BT20, MDA-MB-453 and JIMT-1 cells.Expression of ZnR/GPR39 was increased in grade 3 human breast cancer biopsiescompared to grade 2. Consistently, analysis of two breast cancer patient cohorts,GDS4057 and TCGA, indicated that in ER-negative tumors higher ZnR/GPR39 mRNAlevels are associated with more aggressive tumors. Activation of ZnR/GPR39 inTAMR cells triggered MAPK, mTOR and PI3K signaling. Importantly, enhanced cellgrowth and invasiveness was observed in the ER negative breast cancer cells,TAMR, MDA-MB-453 and BT20 cells but not in the ER expressing MCF-7 cells. Thus,we suggest ZnR/GPR39 as a potential therapeutic target for combination treatment in breast cancer, particularly relevant in ER negative tumors.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-26459-5 PMCID: PMC5970167PMID: 29802348
