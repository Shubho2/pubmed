The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) (88-question Adult Edition)and another self-assessment questionnaire that contained open questions to obtainmore specific character traits were used to complete this survey. The results of the E scale showed that 121 women (46.18%) in the case group and 94 women(35.88%) in the control group were extroverted. The results of the N scale showedthat 150 women (57.25%) in the case group and 86 women (32.82%) in the controlgroup had unstable personality. Adjusting for other confounding factors,extroversion and unstable personality were risk factors for breast cancer (Escale: OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.28-2.15; N scale: OR = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.77-4.91).Personality instability was a higher risk factor than extroversion was. Peoplewith unstable personalities were 3.18 times more likely to have breast cancerthan were those who had stable personalities. The results of the self-assessment questionnaire suggested that the more frequent character traits mentioned werebeing concerned over everything, irritable, and perfectionistic, seeking toprevail over others, and being manipulative and oversensitive.DOI: 10.1080/13548506.2018.1467022 PMID: 29699414
