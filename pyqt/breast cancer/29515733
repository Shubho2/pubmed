We report the case of a 46-year old female patient whohad been followed up since she was 30 years old for bilateral adenofibromatosisthat required 4 surgical procedures. Patient's medical data were collected in theDepartment of Respiratory Diseases at the Ibn Rochd University Hospital Center,Casablanca. Basing on preoperative assessment before bilateral mastectomy, thepatient underwent chest X-ray that showed opaque right hemithorax exertingcompression on the mediastinum. Clinical examination showed effusion syndrome in the right hemithorax and left supraclavicular cervical adenopathy. Pleuralpuncture biopsy confirmed the presence of poorly differentiated invasivecarcinoma in the pleura, supporting breast origin. Bronchoscopy after pleuralpuncture objectified infiltration of the whole bronchial tree; biopsies confirmedthe anatomopathological results. The recommended treatment strategy was based on multidrug chemotherapy. Patient's evolution was marked by the occurrence ofhepatic metastases. This study shows that adenofibromas require regularmonitoring given the risk of trasformation to breast cancer, which is a frequent cause of pleuropulmonary metastases.DOI: 10.11604/pamj.2017.28.115.13599 PMCID: PMC5837175PMID: 29515733  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
