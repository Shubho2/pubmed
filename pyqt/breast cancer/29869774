In triple-negativebreast cancer and HER2-positive breast cancer, a high density oftumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is an important predictor of NAC response. Thus far, it remains unclear whether the TIL scores in core needle biopsies(CNBs) are closely representative of those in the whole tumor section in resectedspecimens. This study aimed to evaluate the concordance between the TIL scores ofCNBs and resected specimens of breast cancer.METHODS: A total of 220 matched pairs of CNBs and resected specimens of breastcancer were included. Stromal TILs were scored on slides stained with hematoxylinand eosin. Clinicopathologic parameters and the agreement of the TIL scoresbetween CNBs and resected specimens were statistically analyzed.RESULTS: The average TIL score was approximately 4.4% higher for the resectedspecimens than for the CNBs. When the tumors were divided into two groupsaccording to a 60% TIL score cut-off (low and intermediate TIL vs. high TIL),8.2% showed discordance between the CNB and resected specimen. The overallintraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value of the TIL score was 0.895 (95%confidence interval, 0.864-0.920, P < 0.001), and all molecular subtypes showedICC values over 0.8 (P < 0.001). The ICC values were > 0.9 when ≥ 5 cores wereincluded in the CNBs. Tumors with discordant TILs were characterized byhistologic grade III, ER negativity, high proliferative index, and HER2 andtriple-negative subtypes. A high proliferative index was an independent riskfactor for TIL discordance.CONCLUSIONS: The TIL score in CNB specimens is a reliable value that reflects theTIL status of the entire tumor in resected specimens of breast cancer. More than five CNB cores may accurately predict the TIL score of the entire tumor.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4842-7 PMID: 29869774
