However, gadolinium (Gd) based contrast agents can be retained in thebody, inflicting specific cell line cytotoxicity. We investigate the effect ofGadopentatic acid (Gd-DTPA) on human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells. Thesecells exhibit a toggle switch response: exposure to 0.1 and 1 mM concentrationsof Gd-DTPA enhances proliferation, which is hindered at a higher 10 mMconcentration. Proliferation is enhanced when cells transition to 3D morphologiesin post confluent conditions. The proliferation dependence on the concentrationof CA is absent for Hs 578T and MDA-MB-231 triple negative cell lines. MCF-7cells reveal a double toggle switch related to the expression of VEGF, which goesthrough high-low-high downregulation when cells are exposed to 0.1, 1, and 10 mM Gd-DTPA, respectively. Finally, doxorubicin drug response is assessed, which alsoreveals a double toggle switch behavior, where drug cytotoxicity exhibits anonlinear dependence on the CA concentration. A toggle switch in cellcharacteristics that are exposed to 1 mM of Gd-DTPA amplifies the importance ofthis threshold, affecting several cell behaviors if surpassed. This workemphasizes the important effects that CAs can have on cells, specifically Gd-DTPAon MCF-7 cells, and the implications for cell growth and drug response duringclinical and synthetic biology procedures.DOI: 10.1007/s10534-018-0109-3 PMID: 29728885
