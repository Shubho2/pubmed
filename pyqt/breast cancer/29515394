To our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of afatinib for pleomorphic carcinoma followed by the surgicalresection. The patient was a 59-year-old woman, who visited our hospital because chest computed tomography showed a 28 Ã— 28-mm nodule in the left upper lobe.Bronchoscopy was performed and the histological findings of transbronchial biopsyrevealed adenosquamous carcinoma positive for G719X mutation in exon 18 of theEGFR. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computedtomography revealed a positive accumulation in the bilateral hilar andmediastinal lymph nodes, the disease was diagnosed as cT1bN3M0, stage IIIB. After3 months of afatinib therapy, FDG accumulation in primary tumor was almost gone. However, FDG accumulation in lymph nodes remained unchanged. Video-assistedthoracic surgery was planned for further diagnostic information and left upperlobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed. The resectedtumor included adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and spindle cellcomponents, without lymph node metastasis. Thus, the disease was diagnosed aspleomorphic carcinoma (pT2aN0M0, stage IB). All components in the resectedspecimen had the same G719X mutation in exon 18 of the EGFR. The patient hasshown no signs of recurrence at 1 year after the operation. The present caseindicates the possibility of minor EGFR mutations in pleomorphic carcinoma andsuccessful outcome by the use of afatinib and surgical resection.DOI: 10.1159/000480120 PMCID: PMC5836259PMID: 29515394
