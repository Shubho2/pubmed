The standard duration of adjuvant endocrinetreatment has been 5 years for a long time. Nevertheless, the high number ofrecurrences occurring after 5 years suggested that extended endocrine therapycould further improve outcome, which led to the start of several randomizedclinical trials investigating the effects of extended use of endocrine therapy.The extended duration of tamoxifen has been shown to improve disease-freesurvival and overall survival in the ATLAS and aTTom trials. However, inpostmenopausal women, AIs have been shown to be more effective when compared withtamoxifen. Based hereon, it is recommended that adjuvant endocrine therapy inpostmenopausal women with early breast cancer should include an AI. Recently, theDATA, IDEAL, and NSABP B42 trials showed that extended adjuvant endocrine therapywith AIs beyond 5 years in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer didreduce the occurrence of secondary breast tumors, but had no or only a smallimpact on distant metastasis free survival. Furthermore, toxicity of adjuvant AIsled to gradually decreasing compliance rates and long-term toxicities tonon-breast cancer-related deaths. Therefore, we suggest considering extendedadjuvant treatment only in women with high-risk early breast cancer who tolerate treatment well.DOI: 10.1007/s11864-018-0541-1 PMCID: PMC5937869PMID: 29704066
