We aimed to explore why these analyses may haveyielded different conclusions. Methods We conducted a systematic literaturereview of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of ODX. We examined the extent towhich the structure of CEA modeling, the assumptions of the models, and theselection of input parameters influenced cost-effectiveness estimates. We alsoexplored the prevalence of industry funding and whether industry funding wasassociated with study designs favoring ODX. Results We identified 27 analyses, 15of which received industry funding. In 18 studies, the clinical characteristics(eg, tumor size and grade) commonly used to make chemotherapy decisions were not incorporated into simulation modeling; thus, these studies would favor ODX being cost effective and might not reflect clinical practice. Most studies ignored the heterogeneous effect of ODX on chemotherapy use; only five studies assumed thatODX would increase chemotherapy use for clinically low-risk patients but decreasechemotherapy use for clinically high-risk patients. No study usedpopulation-based joint distributions of ODX recurrence score and tumorcharacteristics, and 12 studies inappropriately assumed that chemotherapy wouldincrease distant recurrence for the low recurrence score group; both approachesoverestimated the benefits of ODX. Industry-funded studies tended to favor ODX;all five studies that reported ODX as being cost saving were industry funded. In contrast, two studies that reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio >$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year were not funded by industry. ConclusionAlthough a majority of published analyses indicated that ODX is cost effective,they incorporated study designs that can increase the risk of bias.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.76.5941 PMCID: PMC5978470 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29659329
