The purpose of this systematic review is to understand therelationship between urban neighborhood and residential factors and breast cancerincidence and prognosis in African American women. Using PubMed and Web ofScience, the existing literature was reviewed. Observational, cross-sectional,cohort, and prospective studies until February 2017 were examined. Studiesincluding populations of African American women, setting in "urban" areas, and a measure of a neighborhood or residential factor were reviewed. Four parametersrelated to neighborhood or residential factors were extracted including:neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), residential segregation, spatial accessto mammography, and residential pollution. Our analysis showed that AfricanAmerican women living in low nSES have greater odds of late stage diagnosis andmortality. Furthermore, African American women living in segregated areas (higherpercentage of Blacks) have higher odds of late stage diagnosis and mortalitycompared to White and Hispanic women living in less segregated areas (lowerpercentage of Blacks). Late stage diagnosis was also shown to be significantlyhigher in areas with poor mammography access and areas with higher Blackresidential segregation. Lastly, residential pollution did not affect breastcancer risk in African American women. Overall, this systematic review provides aqualitative synthesis of major neighborhood and residential factors on breastcancer outcomes in African American women.DOI: 10.1007/s12672-018-0325-x PMID: 29417390
