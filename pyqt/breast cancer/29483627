Quantitative VTIQ images of each lesion measuring therespective maximum Shear Wave Velocity (SWV) were obtained. Paired and unpaired, non-parametric statistics were applied for comparisons as appropriate. ROC-curve analysis was used to analyse the diagnostic performance of VTIQ and to specify"rule-in" and "rule-out" thresholds for the probability of malignancy. Thestandard of reference was either histopathology or follow-up stability for >24months. 84 lesions were malignant and 112 benign. Median SWV of benign lesionswas significantly lower than that of malignant lesions (p < 0.001). Theapplication of a "rule-out" threshold of 1.9 m/s lead to a sensitivity of >98%with a concomitant significant (p = 0.032) reduction in false positive cases ofalmost 15%, whereas a "rule-in" threshold of 6.5 m/s suggested a probability ofmalignancy of >95%. In conclusion, VTIQ elastography accurately differentiatesmalignant from benign breast lesions. The application of quantitative "rule-in"and "rule-out" thresholds is feasible and allows reduction of unnecessary benign breast biopsies by almost 15%.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22065-7 PMCID: PMC5827686PMID: 29483627
