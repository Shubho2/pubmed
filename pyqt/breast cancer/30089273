However, knowledge of developmental kinetics and mechanisms of lineage specification is lacking. We address this significant knowledge gap by generating a single-cell transcriptome atlas encompassing embryonic, postnatal, and adult mouse mammary development.From these data, we map the chronology of transcriptionally and epigeneticallydistinct cell states and distinguish fetal mammary stem cells (fMaSCs) from theirprecursors and progeny. fMaSCs show balanced co-expression of factors associated with discrete adult lineages and a metabolic gene signature that subsides during maturation but reemerges in some human breast cancers and metastases. These data provide a useful resource for illuminating mammary cell heterogeneity, thekinetics of differentiation, and developmental correlates of tumorigenesis.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).
