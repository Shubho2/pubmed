Electronicaddress: zwcai@hkbu.edu.hk.Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widely used additive in the plastic industry and has been reported to have genotoxicity. A hypothesis that BPA may enhance breast cancerrisk through the formation of its metabolic intermediate or DNA adduct has beenproposed. In this study, breast cancer cell MCF-7 was cultured and the cellularDNA was extracted from the cells. The adducts of bisphenol A 3,4-quinone (BPAQ)with 2'-deoxyguanosine (dG), calf thymus DNA and MCF-7 cell DNA wereinvestigated. DNA adducts were characterized by using electrospray ionizationOrbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry. TheBPA-DNA adducts of BPAQ with dG, calf thymus and MCF-7 cell DNA were identifiedas 3-hydroxy-bisphenol A-N7-guanine (3-OH-BPA-N7Gua). The MS/MS fragmentationpathway of 3-OH-BPA-N7Gua was proposed based on obtained accurate mass data. BPA quinone metabolites can react with MCF-7 cell DNA in vitro. The findings provide evidence that BPA might covalently bind to DNA in MCF-7 cells mediated by quinonemetabolites, which may increase our understanding of health risk associated with BPA exposure.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
