Inhibition of FASN with the anti-obesity drug orlistat has been shown to have significantanti-tumourigenic effects in many cancers, notably breast and prostate. In ourstudy, we investigated whether FASN inhibition using orlistat is an effectiveadjunctive treatment for ovarian cancers that have become platinum resistantusing a cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumour xenograft model in mice. Mice weretreated with orlistat or cisplatin or a combination and metabolite analysis andhistopathology were performed on the tumours ex vivo. Orlistat decreased tumourfatty acid metabolism by inhibiting FASN, cisplatin reduced fatty acidβ-oxidation, and combination treatment delayed tumour growth and inducedapoptotic and necrotic cell death in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cellsover and above that with either treatment alone. Combination treatment alsodecreased glutamine metabolism, nucleotide and glutathione biosynthesis and fattyacid β-oxidation. Our data suggest that orlistat chemosensitisedplatinum-resistant ovarian cancer to treatment with platinum and resulted inenhanced efficacy.© 2018 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley & SonsLtd on behalf of UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31392 PMCID: PMC6055739PMID: 29569717
