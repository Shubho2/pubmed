Here metabolomics, aglobal study of metabolites, has been applied to explore the metabolicalterations that characterize breast cancer progression. We profiled a total of693 metabolites across 87 serum samples related to breast cancer (46 clinicallylocalized and 41 metastatic breast cancer) and 49 normal samples. These unbiased metabolomic profiles were able to distinguish normal individuals, clinicallylocalized and metastatic breast cancer patients. 9-cis-Retinoic acid, an isomerof all-trans retinoic acid, was identified as a differential metabolite thatsignificantly decreased during breast cancer progression to metastasis, and itslevels were also reduced in urine samples from biopsy-positive breast cancerpatients relative to biopsy-negative individuals and in invasive breast cancercells relative to benign MCF-10A cells. The addition of exogenous 9-cis-retinoic acid to MDA-MB-231 cells and knockdown of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1, a regulatory enzyme for 9-cis-retinoic acid, remarkably impaired cellinvasion and migration, presumably through preventing the key regulator cofilinfrom activation and inhibiting MMP2 and MMP9 expression. Taken together, ourstudy showed the potential inhibitory role for 9-cis-retinoic acid in breastcancer progression by attenuating cell invasion and migration.Â© 2018 The Authors.
