The Tromsø Study.Lundblad MW(1), Jacobsen BK(1).Author information: (1)Department of Community Medicine, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø,Norway.Purpose: Early age at menarche (AAM) has been associated with increased mortalityand morbidity, including premature death from all causes, breast cancer andcardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to examine the associationbetween AAM and all-cause mortality.Subjects and methods: A total of 12,409 women aged 25-94 years who took part inthe fourth Tromsø Study in Norway during 1994-1995 were included in thisprospective population-based study with a mean 18.7 years of follow-up.Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to investigate theassociation between AAM and all-cause mortality with adjustment for knownconfounders (age, body mass index, physical activity, level of education andsmoking history).Results: During the 18.7 years of follow-up, a total of 2,203 women died. Therewas no association between AAM and all-cause mortality before or after adjusting for possible confounding factors.Conclusion: This prospective study of 12,409 women did not find any associationbetween AAM and all-cause mortality.DOI: 10.2147/IJWH.S158706 PMCID: PMC5935086PMID: 29750056
