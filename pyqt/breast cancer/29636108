However, the function of GDF15 in cervical cancer has notyet been reported.METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect GDF15 expression in normalcervix and in different cervical cancer lesions. Cell growth curves, MTT, tumorformation assays and flow cytometry were utilized to observe the effects ofectopic GDF15 expression on the proliferation and cell cycle of cervical cancercells. Real-time PCR, western blotting and immunoprecipitation assays wereconducted to measure the expression of genes related to the cell cycle and thePI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assaywas performed to confirm whether C-myc bound to a specific region of the GDF15promoter. Inhibitor treatment and immunoprecipitation assays were employed toidentify the association between GDF15 and ErbB2.RESULTS: GDF15 expression gradually increased during the progression of cervical carcinogenesis. GDF15 promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation via exogenousrhGDF15 treatment or the use of gene editing technology in vitro and in vivo and significantly accelerated the cell cycle transition from G0/G1 to S phase. Theexpression of p-ErbB2, p-AKT1, p-Erk1/2, CyclinD1 and CyclinE1 was up-regulatedand the expression of p21 was down-regulated in GDF15-overexpressing andrhGDF15-treated cervical cancer cells. C-myc trans-activated GDF15 expression by binding to the E-box motifs in the promoter of GDF15 and contributed to thepositive feedback of GDF15/C-myc/GDF15. Furthermore, GDF15 bound to ErbB2 in aprotein complex in cervical cancer cells.CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that GDF15 promoted the proliferation ofcervical cancer cells via the up-regulation of CyclinD1 and CyclinE1 and thedown-regulation of p21 through both the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways in a complex with ErbB2.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0744-0 PMCID: PMC5894198PMID: 29636108
