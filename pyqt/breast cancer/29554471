A necessary step in theinterpretation of collaborative cancer screening model results is to understandhow model structure and model assumptions influence cancer incidence andmortality predictions. In this study, we examined the relative contributions ofthe pre-clinical duration of breast cancer, the sensitivity of screening, and theimprovement in prognosis associated with treatment of screen-detected cases tothe breast cancer incidence and mortality predictions of 5 Cancer Interventionand Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models.METHODS: To tease out the impact of model structure and assumptions on modelpredictions, the Maximum Clinical Incidence Reduction (MCLIR) method compareschanges in the number of breast cancers diagnosed due to clinical symptoms andcancer mortality between 4 simplified scenarios: 1) no-screening; 2) one-timeperfect screening exam, which detects all existing cancers and perfect treatment (i.e., cure) of all screen-detected cancers; 3) one-time digital mammogram andperfect treatment of all screen-detected cancers; and 4) one-time digitalmammogram and current guideline-concordant treatment of all screen-detectedcancers.RESULTS: The 5 models predicted a large range in maximum clinical incidence (19% to 71%) and in breast cancer mortality reduction (33% to 67%) from a one-timeperfect screening test and perfect treatment. In this perfect scenario, themodels with assumptions of tumor inception before it is first detectable bymammography predicted substantially higher incidence and mortality reductionsthan models with assumptions of tumor onset at the start of a cancer'sscreen-detectable phase. The range across models in breast cancer clinicalincidence (11% to 24%) and mortality reduction (8% to 18%) from a one-timedigital mammogram at age 62 y with observed sensitivity and currentguideline-concordant treatment was considerably smaller than achievable underperfect conditions.CONCLUSIONS: The timing of tumor inception and its effect on the length of thepre-clinical phase of breast cancer had a substantial impact on the grouping ofmodels based on their predictions for clinical incidence and breast cancermortality reduction. This key finding about the timing of tumor inception will beincluded in future CISNET breast analyses to enhance model transparency. TheMCLIR approach should aid in the interpretation of variations in model resultsand could be adopted in other disease screening settings to enhance modeltransparency.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X17743244 PMCID: PMC5862068 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29554471
