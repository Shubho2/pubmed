Currently availabledrug treatments for relief of breast cancer-induced bone pain (BCIBP) includenon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and strong opioid analgesics along withinhibitors of osteoclast activity such as bisphosphonates and monoclonalantibodies such as denosumab. However, these medications often lack efficacyand/or they may produce serious dose-limiting side effects. In the present study,we show that J-2156, a somatostatin receptor type 4 (SST4 receptor) selectiveagonist, reverses pain-like behaviors in a rat model of BCIBP induced byunilateral intra-tibial injection of Walker 256 breast cancer cells. Followingintraperitoneal administration, the ED50 of J-2156 for the relief of mechanicalallodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia in the ipsilateral hindpaws was 3.7 and 8.0mg/kg, respectively. Importantly, the vast majority of somatosensory neurons inthe dorsal root ganglia including small diameter C-fibers and medium-largediameter fibers, that play a crucial role in cancer pain hypersensitivities,expressed the SST4 receptor. J-2156 mediated pain relief in BCIBP-rats wasconfirmed by observations of a reduction in the levels of phosphorylatedextracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), a protein essential for centralsensitization and persistent pain, in the spinal dorsal horn. Our resultsdemonstrate the potential of the SST4 receptor as a pharmacological target forrelief of BCIBP and we anticipate the present work to be a starting point forfurther mechanism-based studies.DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00495 PMCID: PMC5962878PMID: 29867498
