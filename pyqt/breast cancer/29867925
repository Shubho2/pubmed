It is wellestablished that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) take up tumor-derivedexosomes. However, the functional impact of these exosomes on macrophagephenotypes is controversial and not well studied. Here, we show that breastcancer-derived exosomes alter the phenotype of macrophages through theinterleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor beta (glycoprotein 130, gp130)-STAT3 signalingpathway. Addition of breast cancer-derived exosomes to macrophages results in theactivation of the IL-6 response pathway, including phosphorylation of the keydownstream transcription factor STAT3. Exosomal gp130, which is highly enrichedin cancer exosomes, triggers the secretion of IL-6 from BMDMs. Moreover, theexposure of BMDMs to cancer-derived exosomes triggers changes from a conventionaltoward a polarized phenotype often observed in tumor-associated macrophages. All of these effects can be inhibited through the addition of a gp130 inhibitor tocancer-derived exosomes or by blocking BMDMs exosome uptake. Collectively, thiswork demonstrates that breast cancer-derived exosomes are capable of inducingIL-6 secretion and a pro-survival phenotype in macrophages, partially viagp130/STAT3 signaling.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00871 PMCID: PMC5951966PMID: 29867925
