It is not clear if it is also a risk factor for the development ofcontralateral breast cancer.METHODS: The data were obtained from Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium andincluded women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ between ages 18 and 88 and years 1995 and 2009. Each case of contralateral breastcancer was matched with three controls based on year of first breast cancerdiagnosis, race, and length of follow-up. A total of 847 cases and 2541 controls were included. The risk factors included in the study were mammographic breastdensity, age of first breast cancer diagnosis, family history of breast cancer,anti-estrogen treatment, hormone replacement therapy, menopausal status, andestrogen receptor status, all from the time of first breast cancer diagnosis.Both univariate analysis and multivariate conditional logistic regressionanalysis were performed.RESULTS: In the final multivariate model, breast density, family history ofbreast cancer, and anti-estrogen treatment remained significant with p valuesless than 0.01. Increasing breast density had a dose-dependent effect on the riskof contralateral breast cancer. Relative to 'almost entirely fat' category ofbreast density, the adjusted odds ratios (and p values) in the multivariateanalysis for 'scattered density,' 'heterogeneously dense,' and 'extremely dense' categories were 1.65 (0.036), 2.10 (0.002), and 2.32 (0.001), respectively.CONCLUSION: Breast density is an independent and significant risk factor fordevelopment of contralateral breast cancer. This risk factor should contribute toclinical decision making.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4736-8 PMID: 29511964
