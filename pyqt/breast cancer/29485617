However, the complexity ofmutation profiles of cancer patients hinders the further understanding tomechanisms of oncogenesis. One basic question is how to find mutations withfunctional impacts. In this work, we introduce a computational method to predict functional somatic mutations of each patient by integrating mutation recurrencewith expression profile similarity. With this method, the functional mutationsare determined by checking the mutation enrichment among a group of patients withsimilar expression profiles. We applied this method to three cancer types andidentified the functional mutations. Comparison of the predictions for threecancer types suggested that most of the functional mutations werecancer-type-specific with one exception to p53. By checking predicted results, wefound that our method effectively filtered non-functional mutations resultingfrom large protein sizes. In addition, this method can also perform functionalannotation to each patient to describe their association with signalling pathwaysor biological processes. In breast cancer, we predicted "cell adhesion" and otherterms to be significantly associated with oncogenesis.DOI: 10.3390/ht7010006 PMCID: PMC5876532PMID: 29485617
