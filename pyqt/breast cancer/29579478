New evidence of the additional value of surgery in these patients isscarce while prognoses without surgery remains poor.PATIENTS AND METHODS: For this case matched analysis, all nationally registeredpatients with BCLM confined to the liver in the Netherlands (systemic group;N = 523) were selected and compared with patients who received systemic treatmentand underwent hepatectomy (resection group; N = 139) at a hepatobiliary centre inFrance. Matching was based on age, decade when diagnosed, interval to metastases,maximum metastases size, single or multiple tumours, chemotherapy, hormonal ortargeted therapy after diagnosis. Based on published guidelines, palliativesystemic treatment strategies are similar in both European countries.RESULTS: Between 1983 and 2013, 3894 patients were screened for inclusion.Overall median follow-up was 80 months (95% CI 70-90 months). The median, 3- and 5-year overall survival of the whole population was 19 months, 29% and 19%,respectively. The resection and systemic group had median survival of 73 vs. 13months (P < 0.001), respectively. Three and 5-year survival was 18% and 10% forthe systemic group and 75% and 54% for the resection group, respectively. Aftermatching, the resection group had a median overall survival of 82 months with a3- and 5-year overall survival of 81% and 69%, respectively, compared with amedian overall survival of 31 months in the systemic group with a 3- and 5-yearoverall survival of 32% and 24%, respectively (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.52;P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: For patients with BCLM, liver resection combined with systemictreatment results in improved overall survival compared to systemic treatmentalone. Liver resection should be considered in selected cases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejca.2018.02.024 PMID: 29579478
