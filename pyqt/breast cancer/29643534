This study was todesign and construct a radiolabeled probe targeting miR-155 for in vivo imagingin breast cancer.METHODS: Anti-miR-155 oligonucleotide (AMO-155) was chemically synthesized with2' OMe modification. Its 5' end was linked with acetyl amine group. Afterchelated with a bifunctional chelator NHS-MAG3, AMO-155 was radiolabeled with99mTc using stannous chloride. The serum stability was evaluated at cellularlevel. In vivo imaging was performed in MCF-7 tumor bearing mice after theadministration of 99mTc radiolabeled AMO-155 and scramble control probes,respectively. Furthermore, the blocked imaging of tumor bearing mice was obtainedafter the injection of unlabeled AMO-155 2 hours ahead. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231tumor bearing mice with different expression level of miR-155 were imaged,respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to identify theexpression level of miR-155 in the bearing tumors.RESULTS: 99mTc-AMO-155 was prepared with high radiolabeled efficiency (97%),radiochemical purity (greater than 98%), and radioactive specific activity (3.75 GBq/Î¼g). 99mTc-AMO-155 was stable in fresh human serum for 12 hours. After theadministration via tail vein, 99mTc-AMO-155 displayed significant accumulation inMCF-7 bearing tumors with high expression level of miR-155, whereas 99mTc-controlshowed little accumulation. After blocked with unlabeled AMO-155, the tumor couldnot be visualized clearly after the administration of 99mTc-AMO-155. Furthermore,99mTc-AMO-155 could show the differential expression of miR-155 in vivo. MCF-7tumor was shown with significantly higher radioactive accumulation thanMDA-MB-231, based on its higher expression level of miR-155, which was verifiedby qRT-PCR.CONCLUSION: 99mTc-labeled AMO-155 with chemical modification showed good serumstability and in vivo tumor targeting ability. This study provides a potentialprobe for in vivo imaging of breast cancer.PMID: 29643534
