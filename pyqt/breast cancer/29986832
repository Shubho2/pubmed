Moreover, the therapeutic effect of the drugs is often reduced by thestrengthening of chemoresistance, which occurs via a variety of mechanisms.Different strategies have been developed to reduce multidrug resistance(MDR)-associated gene expressions including the use of surfactants and polymers. In this study superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) functionalized with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) reduced the number and viability of cells in comparison with both untreated cells or cells treated with SPIONs alone. Thiscytostatic effect correlated with the increase of peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptors γ (PPARγ). The necrotic cell death induced, as aconsequence, an inflammatory process, as evidenced by the decrease of theanti-inflammatory PPARα and increase of pro-inflammatory TNFα and IL-1β. PPARswere examined because CLA is one of their natural ligands. The antitumor effectobserved was accompanied by a down-regulation of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which wasthe first important discovered efflux transporter belonging to MDR, and ofALDH3A1, an enzyme able to metabolize some drugs, reducing their effects. Thedown-regulation of P-gp correlated with the increase of cytokines. The ALDH3A1decrease correlated with the increase of PPARγ. Based on these results, PPARs aremolecular mediators of anti-cancer effect of SPIONs functionalized with CLA,being changes in these nuclear receptors correlated with induction ofcytotoxicity and inflammation, and decreased ability of cancer cells in blocking anti-cancer drug effect.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
