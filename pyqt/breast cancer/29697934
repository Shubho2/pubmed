Allfour studies were conducted in a quality assessment according to the NewcastleOttawa Scale system. The strength of association between 5ARIs and the prevalenceof MBC was evaluated by using summarized unadjusted pooled RR with a 95%confidence interval [CI]. Four studies involving 595.776 participants, mean agerange from 60 to 73.2 years old, were included in a meta-analysis, which produceda summary unadjusted RR of the risk of MBC for the treatment of 5ARIs of 1.16(95% CI 0.85-1.58, P=0.36) and the multivariable-adjusted RR is 1.03, (95% CI0.75-1.41, p=0.86). There was no heterogeneity among included studies (I2=0%,P=0.49). Estimates of total effects were generally consistent with thesensitivity.CONCLUSION: We did not observe a positive association between the use of 5ARIsand MBC. The small number of breast cancer cases exposed to 5ARIs and the lack ofna association in our study suggest that the development of breast cancer should not influence the prescribing of 5ARIs therapy.Copyright® by the International Brazilian Journal of Urology.DOI: 10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2017.0531 PMID: 29697934
