Electronic address: nsayhan@istanbul.edu.tr.Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women worldwide. Breasttumors mostly exhibit aberrant gene expression and DNA hypermethylation patterns that predispose the disease. Understanding the genetic and epigenetic factorsthat contribute to breast cancer development is important to identify noveldiagnostic and prognostic markers. SCARA5: Scavenger receptor class A, member 5; is a member of the scavenger receptor family located on chromosome 8p21 which is a frequently deleted region in human cancers. SCARA5 has been identified as acandidate tumor suppressor gene in various kinds of cancer. However, its role in breast cancer remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study SCARA5 expression levels in breast tumors and matched noncancerous tissue samples from 77 patients were analyzed by qRT-PCR and the expression levels were correlated with themethylation level of SCARA5 gene promoter. We found that SCARA5 expression wassignificantly decreased in tumors (92.2%) compared to non-cancerous tissuesamples and this down-regulation was associated with hypermethylation of thepromoter (p < 0.001). A significant correlation was also detected between SCARA5 expression and the histological grade of the breast tumors (p = 0.017). Takentogether, our results indicate that SCARA5 may play an important role intumorigenesis of breast cancer via promoter methylation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
