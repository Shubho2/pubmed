Merr. (Myrtaceae) is used in Costa Rican traditionalmedicine for women's health. Our previous work showed that P. dioica extractswere oestrogenic.OBJECTIVES: This work identifies phytochemicals from P. dioica that areresponsible for the plant's oestrogen-like activities.MATERIALS AND METHODS: P. dioica leaves were collected in Costa Rica in 2005.Fractions resulting from chromatographic separation of a methanol extract weretested at 50 μg/mL in a competitive oestrogen receptor-binding assay. Activecompounds were isolated by HPLC and identified by NMR and MS. Pure compounds weretested at 1 μM in the oestrogen-responsive SEAP reporter gene assay. The effects on cell viability, cytotoxicity and apoptosis were investigated in breast cancer (MCF-7 and SK-BR3) and gastric cancer (AGS and NCI-N87) cell lines using theApoTox-Glo and Caspase-Glo assays and qPCR.RESULTS: Quercitrin and three new chromones, including a 2-phenoxychromone,6,8-di-C-methylcapillarisin (1) were isolated and identified. Compound 1 caused a6.2-fold increase in SEAP expression at 1 μM (p < 0.05). This activity wasblocked by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780. Compound 2 caused a 6.0-fold increasein SEAP, inhibited the growth of MCF-7, AGS and NCI-N87 cells (IC50 54.27, 38.13 and 51.22 μg/mL, respectively), and induced apoptosis via caspase 8 and increasedthe Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio in MCF-7 cells. Compound 3 was anti-oestrogenic in MCF-7cells.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Compounds from P. dioica have oestrogenic,anti-oestrogenic and cytotoxic effects that may explain the ethnomedical use ofthis plant.DOI: 10.1080/13880209.2018.1448873 PMID: 29564971
