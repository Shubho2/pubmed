The CSC theory proposes a hierarchical organization in tumors where at its apex lies a subpopulation of cancer cellsendowed with self-renewal and differentiation capacity.Recent Findings: In breast cancer (BC), CSCs have been suggested to play a keyrole in tumor maintenance, disease progression, and the formation of metastases. In preclinical models of BC, only a few CSCs are required sustain tumorre-growth, especially after conventional anti-endocrine treatments. CSCs include therapy-resistant clones that survive standard of care treatments likechemotherapy, irradiation, and hormonal therapy.Summary: The relevance of hormones for both normal mammary gland and BCdevelopment is well described, but it was only recently that the activities ofhormones on CSCs have been investigated, opening new directions for future BCtreatments and CSCs.DOI: 10.1007/s40778-018-0114-z PMCID: PMC5866269PMID: 29600163
