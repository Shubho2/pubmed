Previously, we reported that elevated β1-integrin isassociated with enhanced breast cancer cell survival postirradiation, but howβ1-integrin conferred radioresistance was unclear. Ionizing radiation (IR)induced cell killing correlates with the efficiency of DNA double-strand break(DSB) repair, and we found that nonmalignant breast epithelial (S1) cells withlow β1-integrin expression have a higher frequency of S-phase-specific IR-inducedchromosomal aberrations than the derivative malignant breast (T4-2) cells withhigh β1-integrin expression. In addition, there was an increased frequency ofIR-induced homologous recombination (HR) repairosome focus formation in T4-2cells compared with that of S1 cells. Cellular levels of Rad51 in T4-2 cells, acritical factor in HR-mediated DSB repair, were significantly higher. Blocking ordepleting β1-integrin activity in T4-2 cells reduced Rad51 levels, while ectopic expression of β1-integrin in S1 cells correspondingly increased Rad51 levels,suggesting that Rad51 is regulated by β1-integrin. The low level of Rad51 proteinin S1 cells was found to be due to rapid degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP). Furthermore, the E3 ubiquitin ligase RING1 was highly upregulated in S1 cells compared to T4-2 cells. Ectopic β1-integrin expression in S1 cellsreduced RING1 levels and increased Rad51 accumulation. In contrast, β1-integrindepletion in T4-2 cells significantly increased RING1 protein levels andpotentiated Rad51 ubiquitination. These data suggest for the first time thatelevated levels of the extracellular matrix receptor β1-integrin can increasetumor cell radioresistance by decreasing Rad51 degradation through aRING1-mediated proteasomal pathway.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.DOI: 10.1128/MCB.00672-17 PMCID: PMC5902589 [Available on 2018-10-16]PMID: 29463647
