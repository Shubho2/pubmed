Epub 2018 May 10.CA 15-3 predicting breast cancer relapse: beware of vitamin B12 deficiency.Rassy EE(1), Ghor MA(1), Kattan J(1).Author information: (1)Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hotel-Dieu de FranceUniversity Hospital, Saint Joseph University,Â  Beirut, Lebanon.A sustained increase of cancer antigen 15-3 serum levels was found in a54-year-old woman treated 2 years ago for early stage breast cancer, without any evidence of cancer recurrence. The patient thereafter developed severemegaloblastic anemia secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency. Supplementation withB12 to reverse the anemia led to the normalization of the cancer antigen 15-3serum levels. As such, with the limited understanding of molecular biology, theintegrative approach of clinical history, physical examination, and diagnosticimaging remain pivotal in the management of cancer patients.DOI: 10.2217/pme-2017-0067 PMID: 29745746
