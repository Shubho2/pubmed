MATERIAL AND METHODS Weevaluated 353 breast cancer patients initially treated with surgery. AS and PPSwere performed by evaluating the pathological data of the patients according tothe AJCC 8th Edition breast cancer updated version. Stages and survival ratesbetween the 2 staging systems were evaluated and compared. Disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were calculated according to bothstaging systems using Kaplan-Meier test. After the PPS change was made in each ASgroup, 10-year DFS and 10-year DSS of the changed groups were compared using the chi-square test. RESULTS The median follow-up was 114 months and the median agewas 48 years. In 192 (54.4%) patients the stage change. The most significantchange was 1-level downstaging in 70 (22.4%) patients, and 2-levels downstagingin 78 (22.1%) patients. Five-year DFS, 10-year DFS, 5-year DSS rate, and 10-year DSS were 86.3%, 80.3%, 93.8%, and 84.1%, respectively. The PPS system was foundto provide better prognostic information when the patients with AS IIB and IIIAgroups were compared according to the PPS. CONCLUSIONS According to the updatedversion of the AJCC 8th Edition, half of our patients had stage change when they were evaluated according to AS and PPS system. PPS gives better information aboutprognosis than does AS.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.911022 PMCID: PMC6007150PMID: 29849016
