Accordingly, our medical institution designed an animal experiment to investigate the effects ofirradiation on capsular contracture. A total of 40 mice (C57BL6) were dividedinto four groups according to whether or not they received irradiation and thetime from implantation to irradiation. After each mouse received aspecially-fabricated, 1.5 cm semi-spherical silicone implant inserted into thearea below the panniculus carnosus, half of the mice were irradiated using singe administration of a 10 Gy dose of radiation (6 MeV). Subsequently, data fromgross inspection, histological analysis and immunohistochemical analysis wereobtained at one and three months postoperatively and analyzed. Changes thatoccurred near the capsule led to the phenomenon of contracture subsequent toencapsulation. Our findings suggest that the inflammation reaction occurring nearthe implant becomes aggravated by 'radiation toxicity' and creates an environmentconducive to capsular contracture. The present study demonstrated the process by which the complication of capsular contracture may occur during the treatment of human breast cancer via radiotherapy. These findings may serve as the basis forresearch and development of future treatments of capsular contracture.DOI: 10.1080/2000656X.2018.1444617 PMID: 29523044
