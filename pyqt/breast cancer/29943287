In this work, modifications of the lysine in SP by homocysteine and an acetyl group as well as the conformational dynamics of the native andmodified SP peptides and their complexes with the NK1 receptor were studied viaMD simulation. It was found that modifying SP stabilizes the peptide structure,but the modified SP peptides are less likely to bind to the NK1 receptor, so the resulting complexes are less stable. The RMSD of native SP (~0.33 nm) is abouttwice as large as that of the modified SP peptides (~0.18 nm), while the RMSD forthe receptor complexed with native SP is ~0.3 nm, and that for the receptorcomplexed with either of the modified peptides is ~0.35 nm, which demonstratesthe high stability of the modified SP peptides as well as the receptor complexed with native SP. Such behavior was also observed in other structural analyses. Thebinding free energies of the native and modified SP peptides with the NK1receptor were also compared. The ΔGbind values for the binding ofhomocysteinylated SP to the NK1 receptor and the binding of the acetylated SP andnative SP to the NK1 receptor were -38.89, -64.46, and - 264.52 kJ mol-1,respectively. Modification of the lysine of SP decreases the binding affinity of the peptide to the NK1 receptor. In other words, homocysteinylation oracetylation of SP leads to weaker interactions of the peptide with the NK1receptor compared to those between native SP and NK1. We propose that thisphenomenon leads to increased levels of homocysteinylated SP in plasma in manydiseases such as breast cancer. Graphical abstract Substance P (SP) is aneuropeptide which binds to the NK1 receptor. SP is of great pharmacologicalinterest, as agonists and antagonists of SP can potentially be used to treat manychronic diseases. Therefore, in this work, the lysine (LYS) in SP wastheoretically modified with a homocysteine or acetyl group to explore the effectsof such a modification on the binding affinity of this peptide with the NK1receptor and the structural dynamics of the resulting complex.DOI: 10.1007/s00894-018-3695-7 PMID: 29943287
