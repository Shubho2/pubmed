Nevertheless, it elicits a lot ofinterest both for the peculiar morphology and the characteristic geneticfeatures. Currently, there is no consensus on optimal treatment strategy.Therefore, it is useful to report every case in order to establish treatmentalgorithms.METHODS: We describe the case of a 6-year-old boy diagnosed with a SBC, withpeculiar genomic and immunohistochemical features. Moreover, we carried out areview of the literature in order to analyze the present state of knowledge aboutthis rare entity.RESULTS: To the best of our knowledge, there are only 120 cases published inliterature, only 32 in males and only 2 younger than 6Â years. Furthermore, thisone had peculiar genomic and immunohistochemical features. Indeed, even if SBCexpresses basal-cell markers, our patient had a triple-negative tumor expressing both basal and luminal cell markers. Furthermore, the boy's genomic profilerevealed not only positivity for the typical SBC's translocation t(12;15), butalso for a 3q28 duplication, found in his father (healthy) and paternalgrandfather (with a previous BC). None were positive for BRCA mutation. Thislocus includes only one gene encoding for a growth factor recently linked toEarly Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy-47 and Idiopathic ventriculartachycardia. Even if the literature does not provide evidence of a pathogenicrole it is not possible to exclude a cancer-predisposing activity.CONCLUSIONS: SBC is a rare type of BC, characterized by triple-negative features with an unexpectedly good prognosis. More data are needed to fully understand thebehavior of this cancer and genomic profiling could be helpful in improving itsdiagnosis and management.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4772-4 PMID: 29616377
