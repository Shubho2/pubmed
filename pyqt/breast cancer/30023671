It requires the recognition and quantification of low amounts of specific molecularbiomarkers, either free or transported inside nanovesicles, through thedevelopment of novel sensitive diagnostic technologies. In this context, we have developed a nanoarray platform for the noninvasive quantification of cancerbiomarkers circulating in the bloodstream. The assay is based on molecularmanipulation to create functional spots of surface-immobilized binders anddifferential topography measurements. It is label-free and requires just a singlebinder per antigen, and when it is implemented with fluorescencelabeling/readout, it can be used for epitope mapping. As a benchmark, we focused on the plasma release of Her2 extracellular domain (ECD), a proposed biomarkerfor the progression of Her2-positive tumors and response to anticancer therapies.By employing robust, easily engineered camelid nanobodies as binders, we measuredECD-Her2 concentrations in the range of the actual clinical cutoff value forHer2-positive breast cancer. The specificity for Her2 detection was preservedwhen it was measured in parallel with other potential biomarkers, demonstrating aforthcoming implementation of this approach for multiplexing analysis.Prospectively, this nanorarray platform may be customized to allow for thedetection of promising new classes of circulating biomarkers, such as exosomesand microvesicles.DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00284 PMCID: PMC6044866PMID: 30023671
