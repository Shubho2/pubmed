Latent class profile analysis ofNEO-FFI scores was used to identify patient subgroups.Results: Three latent classes were identified. The "Distressed" class (14.3%)scored highest on neuroticism and lowest on extraversion, agreeableness, andconscientiousness. The "Resilient" class (31.9%) scored lowest on neuroticism andhighest on extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The "Normative"class (53.8%) was intermediate on all dimensions except openness. Compared to theResilient class, patients in the Distressed class were younger, less educated,more likely to care for another adult, had more comorbidities, and exercisedless. The three classes differed by performance status, marital and employmentstatus, and income, but not by gender, time since diagnosis, or type of priorcancer treatment. The classes differed (Distressed > Normative > Resilient) indepression, anxiety, and cancer symptoms.Conclusions: Personality is associated with psychological and physical symptomsin cancer patients.DOI: 10.1016/j.paid.2017.05.039 PMCID: PMC5822738 [Available on 2018-10-15]PMID: 29479128
