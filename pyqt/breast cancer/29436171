Hospital coding databases,oncology databases and medical records were reviewed for baselinecharacteristics, treatment details and outcomes. The primary outcome was cardiac toxicity (including myocardial infarction, admission for cardiac chest pain,coronary angiogram positivity and ischaemic cardiac death). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to derive ischaemic cardiac event free and overall survival. Predefinedunivariate and multivariate analysis was performed to investigate interactionwith radiation fraction size, cardiac risk factors, age and side of cancer.Standardised mortality ratios were constructed.RESULTS: Five hundred and one patients were identified, 220 treated with CFRT and281 with HFRT. The median age was 56 and median follow-up 10.33 years. The10-year breast cancer specific survival was 81.8% (95% CI %.78.1-85.0). The10-year freedom from cardiac death was 98.6% (95% CI 96.9-99.4). There were 27post radiation cardiac events including 5 cardiac deaths and 19 cases of acutemyocardial infarction. 265 (53%) had at least one cardiac risk factor. Twentyfive of the 27 patients with a cardiac event had cardiac risk factors. Onunivariate and multivariate analysis, fractionation schedule was notsignificantly associated with a post radiation ischaemic event, however, therewas a significant relationship with age and the presence of a cardiac riskfactor. The standardised mortality ratio was 0.89 (95% CI: 0-3.13).CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown a low rate of ischaemic cardiac disease for bothCFRT and HFRT in women treated for breast cancer with no evidence of an effectwith fractionation schedule. Coexisting cardiac risk factors are common in thepopulation.Â© 2018 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.DOI: 10.1111/1754-9485.12712 PMID: 29436171
