Esophageal squamous cellcarcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common and most aggressively malignantcancers with dismal prognosis. However, the state of IKBKE expression in ESCC is still unknown and its potential value remains unexplored.Patients and methods: IKBKE protein expression was evaluated byimmunohistochemistry in 118 paraffin specimens of ESCC treated by curativesurgery. All patients were regularly followed up by telephone over 3 years after surgery. The chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazardregression model were used to analyze the relationship of IKBKE expression,clinicopathological characteristics, and prognostic value for ESCC.Results: IKBKE expression was 61.9% (73/118) in paraffin-embedded archived ESCC. Its expression was significantly associated with tumor differentiation grade(p=0.045) and advanced TNM (pathologic tumor node metastasis) stages (p=0.023).In univariate analysis, IKBKE expression was closely associated with decreased3-year disease-free survival (HR 1.804, 95% CI 1.076-3.027; p=0.023) and overall survival (HR 2.118, 95% CI 1.189-3.773; p=0.009). Meanwhile, in multivariateanalysis it was identified as an independent prognostic factor for 3-yeardisease-free survival (HR 1.777, 95% CI 1.034-3.054; p=0.037) and overallsurvival (HR 2.078, 95% CI 1.138-3.796; p=0.017).Conclusion: Our data indicated for the first time that IKKε expression is ahighly recurrent event in ESCC and could play a pivotal role in the evaluation ofprognosis. IKBKE upregulation is negatively associated with disease-free survivaland overall survival. Therefore, IKBKE could serve as a prognostic variable andpotential therapeutic target for this malignancy.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S156818 PMCID: PMC5846766PMID: 29563809
