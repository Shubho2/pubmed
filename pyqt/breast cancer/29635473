However, the association between type 1 diabetesand the risk of cancer has not been well addressed. This study aimed toinvestigate the association between type 1 diabetes and the risk of cancer byusing a meta-analysis of observational studies.Methods: We searched PubMed and EMBASE for observational studies that examinedthe association between type 1 diabetes and cancer in April 2017. We calculatedthe pooled odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) with confidence intervals(CIs) from individual studies based on a random-effects model meta-analysis.Results: We included a total of 15 observational studies with two case-controlstudies and 13 cohort studies involving 31 893 cancer patients among a total of 1915 179 participants in the final analysis. In the random-effects meta-analysisof all studies, patients with type 1 diabetes had an increased risk of cancer (ORor RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09-1.52; n = 15; I2 = 95.2%). In the subgroupmeta-analysis by type of cancer, type 1 diabetes significantly increased the riskof cancers of stomach, lung, pancreas, liver, ovary and kidney, whereas itsignificantly decreased the risk of breast cancer (OR or RR, 0.91; 95% CI,0.86-0.95; n = 9; I2 = 0%).Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that type 1 diabetes is associated withthe increased risk of several types of cancer and the decreased risk of breastcancer. However, the plausible mechanisms for the decreased risk of breast cancerremain unclear. Further prospective studies with proper adjustment for possibleconfounding factors are warranted.DOI: 10.1093/jjco/hyy047 PMID: 29635473  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
