Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networksare effective tools in studying the functional roles of proteins in thedevelopment of various diseases. However, they are insufficient without thesupport of additional biological knowledge for proteins such as their molecularfunctions and biological processes. To enhance PPI networks, we utilizebiological properties of individual proteins as well. More specifically, weintegrate keywords from UniProt database describing protein properties into thePPI network and construct a novel heterogeneous PPI-Keyword (PPIK) networkconsisting of both proteins and keywords. As proteins with similar functionalduties or involving in the same metabolic pathway tend to have similartopological characteristics, we propose to represent them with metagraphs.Compared to the traditional network motif or subgraph, a metagraph can capturethe topological arrangements through not only the protein-protein interactionsbut also protein-keyword associations. We feed those novel metagraphrepresentations into classifiers for disease protein prediction and conduct ourexperiments on three different PPI databases. They show that the proposed method consistently increases disease protein prediction performance across variousclassifiers, by 15.3% in AUC on average. It outperforms the diffusion-based(e.g., RWR) and the module-based baselines by 13.8-32.9% in overall diseaseprotein prediction. Breast cancer protein prediction outperforms RWR, PRINCE, andthe module-based baselines by 6.6-14.2%. Finally, our predictions also exhibitbetter correlations with literature findings from PubMed database.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-8561-6_16 PMID: 30030814
