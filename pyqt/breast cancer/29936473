Echocardiogrammonitoring was used to evaluate the decrease in left ventricular ejectionfraction (LVEF).RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 5 years, cardiotoxicity was as follows: amongthe 15 patients treated with 46 Gy: grade (G) 2 in two (13%), G1 in three (20%), and G0 in 10 (67%);in those treated with 39 Gy (16 patients): G1 in five (31%),and G0 in 11 (69%);among the 21 patients treated with 35 Gy: G2 in one (5%), G1in five (24%), and G0 in 15 (71%).CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab was shown to be a safe adjuvant treatment whenadministered with concomitant HRT since it did not increase cardiotoxicity inthose with left-sided breast cancer. No differences in LVEF were observed betweenthe HRT schemes.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11322 PMID: 29936473
