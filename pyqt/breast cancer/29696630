To examine this putative association, we performed asystematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of cohort studies reporting bodymass index (BMI) and the risk of 23 cancer types. PubMed, Embase, and Web ofScience were searched for cohort studies, yielding 325 articles with 1,525,052cases. Strong positive associations were observed between BMI and endometrialcancer (RR: 1.48), esophageal adenocarcinoma (RR: 1.45), and kidney cancer (RR:1.20); weaker associations (RR < 1.20) were also found for several other cancertypes. Interestingly, we found significant inverse associations between BMI andoral cavity (RR: 0.93), lung (RR: 0.91), premenopausal breast (RR: 0.95), andlocalized prostate (RR: 0.97) cancers. A male-specific association was found for colorectal cancer (p = 0.023), and a female-specific association was found forcancer in brain (p = 0.025) or kidney (p = 0.035). With respect to geography, thestrongest positive association was found for total cancer in North America(p = 0.038). This comprehensive meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidencesupporting the association between BMI and cancer risk. These findings can beused to drive public policies and to help guide personalized medicine in order tobetter manage body weight, thereby reducing the risk of developingobesity-related cancer.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31553 PMID: 29696630
