[Epub ahead of print]Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma Manifesting as Pleural Effusion in a Patient with Long-Standing Eosinophilia.Belludi CK(1), Qian ET(2), Tolle JJ(3), Brown RM(3), Ann Thompson M(1),Juskevicius R(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt UniversityMedical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.(2)Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville,Tennessee.(3)Department of Allergy/Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, VanderbiltUniversity Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a lymphoma of T-cell origin,characterized by the presence of large lymphoid cells with abundant cytoplasm andpleomorphic, often horseshoe-shaped nuclei (hallmark cells), as well as strongand uniform expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)30. Two distinctclinicopathologic categories of ALCL include primary cutaneous ALCL and systemic ALCL. Systemic ALCL is further classified into anaplastic lymphoma kinase(ALK)-positive, ALK-negative, and breast implant-associated ALCL. Most ALCLsoccurring in adults are ALK negative and present in lymph nodes rather thanextranodal sites.Primary diagnosis of ALCL in the pleural fluid is extremelyrare, with no convincing recent reports available that are based in currentunderstanding of this entity. Herein, we describe a well-characterized case ofALK-negative ALCL with no rearrangement but amplification of DUSP22/IRF4,diagnosed by cytologic examination of the pleural effusion in a 68-year-old whiteman with a 3-year history of unexplained eosinophilia and pulmonary infiltrates. Also, we present a review of the literature and discuss the current understandingof ALCL based on the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO)classification of lymphoid neoplasms.DOI: 10.1093/labmed/lmy035 PMID: 30016448
