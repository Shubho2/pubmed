While breast lymphatic drainage involves both axillary andinternal mammary (IM) lymph node (LN) basins, IM LN sampling is not routinelyadvocated. The current study analyzes the incidence of IM LN metastases sampledduring free flap breast reconstruction and subsequent changes in adjuvanttreatment.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with positive IM LN biopsies duringfree flap breast reconstruction was performed. Pre-reconstruction surgical andadjuvant therapies as well as staging and prognostic data were recorded. Changein adjuvant therapies based solely on IM LN positivity was determined.RESULTS: IM LN metastases were found on 28 (1.3%) out of 2057 patients andcomprised the study population. Mean age was 49 years with pre-reconstructionchemotherapy or radiation administered in 50 or 54% of cases, respectively. Five (18%) patients had previously undergone lumpectomy with axillary sampling. Meantumor size was 3.1 cm with tumor location evenly distributed among all fourquadrants. Ten (36%) patients had isolated IM LN metastases Patients with bothaxillary and IM disease had larger lesions, increased prevalence ofpre-reconstruction chemotherapy and radiation. Based exclusively on positive IMLN disease, 17 (63%) patients had a change in adjuvant therapy.CONCLUSION: Despite the low incidence of IM LN metastases, IM LN biopsy duringfree flap breast reconstruction is recommended. In 36% of cases, nodal metastaseswere isolated to the IM nodes. Identification of IM metastases influencedadjuvant therapies in a majority of cases.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6352-6 PMID: 29497911
