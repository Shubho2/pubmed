Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and EndResults (SEER), the early breast cancer patients (T1-2N0-2M0) were extracted from1998-2007. This study included 1,111 and 2,151 patients with early MBC and FBC,respectively, whose clinicopathological characteristics were well balanced. At a mean follow-up time of 97 months, 10-year OS rate was 58.3% in the MBC group and 68.7% in the FBC (log-rank test, P < 0.001; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.45, 95%confidence interval (CI) = 1.29 to 1.64). Adjusted HR for OS between MBC and FBC were revealed from propensity score matched-multivariable Cox proportionalhazards models (HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.35 to 1.73). Similar adjusted SMRs between MBC and FBC ((SMR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.83,2.14) for FBC and (SMR = 2.07, 95%CI = 1.88-2.28) for MBC) were observed. The nomogram was constructed for FBC, andpredicted probabilities were generally good (C-index = 0.71), whose area undercurve is higher than TNM stage classification (0.74 vs 0.62). OS wassignificantly decreased among early MBC patients compared with FBC, but similarSMRs and its trends by age groups were observed between MBC and FBC except foryoung patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-26199-6 PMCID: PMC5995882PMID: 29891971
