[Epub ahead of print]Thymidine kinase 1 as a tumor biomarker: technical advances offer new potentialto an old biomarker.Jagarlamudi KK(1)(2), Shaw M(2).Author information: (1)Department of Anatomy, Physiology & Biochemistry, Swedish University ofAgricultural Sciences, VHC, PO Box 7011, SE 75007 Uppsala, Sweden.(2)AroCell AB, Virdings All√© 32B, SE-754 50 Uppsala, Sweden.Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) is a key enzyme in DNA precursor synthesis. It isupregulated during the S phase of the cell cycle and its presence in cells is an indicator of active cell proliferation. In studies since the 1980s, TK1 has been shown as a clinically valuable biomarker for the management of hematologicalmalignancies. However, TK1 activity assays may underestimate serum TK1 insubjects with solid tumors limiting its sensitivity. The development of TK1immunoassays has made the assay of TK1 more widely available and increased itsapplicability to solid tumor diseases. This paper will review TK1 as a tumorbiomarker with emphasis on recent studies and technologies plus highlight itspotential in drug discovery and as a therapeutic target.DOI: 10.2217/bmm-2018-0157 PMID: 30039979
