This study aimed to analyze the clinical, endoscopic, and pathologicfeatures of secondary tumors that had been diagnosed endoscopically.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective database analysis of 217 patients withsecondary tumors of the GI tract. Endoscopic findings and histologic diagnoseswere systematically re-evaluated.RESULTS: Malignant melanoma (n = 33, 15%), breast cancer (n = 32, 15%), andpancreatic cancer (n = 27, 12%) were the most common corresponding primaries.About one-third of secondary tumors were detected in the stomach (n = 76, 35%),followed by small intestine (n = 54, 25%) and rectum (n = 53, 24%). The mediantime between the diagnoses of primary and secondary tumors was 19 months (mean,31; range, 0-251), and this time was particularly long for renal cell carcinomaand breast cancer (median, 38 and 45 months, respectively). Direct invasion from extra-GI malignancies was more common (56%) than vascular cancer spread (44%) anddepended on both sites of tumor involvement and corresponding primary. Thelesions presented with various endoscopic patterns. In patients for whom adefinitive diagnosis of cancer was known before the examination (n = 168), asecondary tumor was included in the differential diagnosis in only 48% oflesions. It is of note that the remaining cases were diagnosed endoscopically as primary tumors and rarely also as nonneoplastic change.CONCLUSIONS: Secondary tumors may affect all parts of the GI tract. Malignantmelanoma and breast and pancreatic cancer represent the most common primaries.Diagnosis based on examination of biopsy specimens is crucial to avoidmisclassification.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.
