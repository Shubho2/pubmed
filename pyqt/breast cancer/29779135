In this study,QOL-Questionnaire for Cancer Patients Treated with Anti-Cancer Drugs-the Breast(QOL-ACD-B) was modified to be suitable for preoperative chemotherapy (POC) andwas named the QOL-ACD-BP.METHODS: A total of 300 patients were treated with POC after being diagnosed withbreast cancer between February 2007 and December 2016 at our institute. Weevaluated novel evaluation scale for QOL (QOL-ACD-BP) before and after POC in aretrospective manner.RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis with overall survival, the high QOL before [p = 0.048, hazard ratio (HR) 0.441] or after POC (p = 0.030, HR 0.273) was anindependent factor.CONCLUSION: Our study shows that QOL after POC may also affect prognosis andsupported the importance of maintaining QOL in cancer treatment. In patients withbreast cancer treated with POC, QOL-ACD-BP, which is a new QOL evaluation index, was found to be a useful tool for predicting the patients' prognosis.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2670-0 PMCID: PMC6061048PMID: 29779135  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
