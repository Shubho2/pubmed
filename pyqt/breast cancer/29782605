In this article, we review the mostpertinent historical developments, emerging clinical applications of novelradiotracers and imaging technologies, and potential implications for trainingand practice. This includes an overview of novel tracers for prostate, breast,and neuroendocrine tumors, assessment of tumor heterogeneity, the concept ofimage-guided 'biologically relevant dosing', and theranostic applications. Recenttechnological advancements, including time-of-flight PET, PET/MRI, and'one-minute whole-body PET', are also covered. Finally, we discuss how theserapidly evolving applications might affect current training curricula and howimaging-derived big data could be harnessed to the benefit of our patients.DOI: 10.1186/s41824-017-0019-6 PMCID: PMC5954767PMID: 29782605
