The compound iscurrently administered to patients intravenously (i.v.) at low pH (3.5) due tosolubility challenges. Reliance of low pH to enhance solubility of CX-5461 canadversely impact pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and therapeutic potential. We have addressed this solubility issue through a formulation method that relies on the interactions between CX-5461 and copper. Copper binds CX-5461 through thenitrogens of the pyrazine ring. Here, we describe synthesizing thiscopper-complexed CX-5461 (Cu(CX-5461)) within liposomes. CX-5461 was added tocopper-containing liposomes and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min. Thepharmacokinetics of CX-5461 was assessed in mice following a single i.v.injection at 30 mg/kg. Efficacy studies were completed in multiple subcutaneousmouse xenografts as well as in a bone marrow engraftment model of acute myeloidleukemia (AML). The novel Cu(CX-5461) formulation was stable at pH 7.4 andexhibited increased plasma circulation longevity, increasing the total exposureto CX5461 by an order of magnitude. Cu(CX-5461) was more active than CX-5461 inAML models in vivo. In HCT116-B46 and Capan-1 solid tumour models that areBRCA-deficient, the Cu(CX-5461) formulation engendered activity that wascomparable to that of the low pH CX-5461 formulation. We have generated the firstCu(CX-5461) formulation suitable for i.v. administration that is more efficaciousthan the existing low-pH formulation in pre-clinical models of AML. TheCu(CX-5461) formulation may serve as an alternative formulation for CX-5461 inBRCA-deficient cancers.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
