A comprehensive analysis isessential for producing reasonable conclusions in patient-reported outcomeresearch particularly for topics of a sensitive nature. This often makes long (â‰¥7pages) questionnaires necessary but these have been shown to reduce responserates in mail surveys. Our work adapted the "Total Design Method," initiallyproduced for commercial markets, to raise response rates in a long (total: 11pages, 116 questions), non-incentivized, very personal postal survey sent toalmost 350 women.Patients and methods: A total of 346 women who had undergone mastectomy andimmediate breast reconstruction from 2008-2014 (inclusive) at Addenbrooke'sUniversity Hospital were sent our study pack (Breast-Q satisfaction questionnaireand support documents) using our modified "Total Design Method." Participantswere sent packs and reminders according to our designed schedule.Results: Of the 346 participants, we received 258 responses, an overall response rate of 74.5% with a useable response rate of 72.3%. One hundred and sixresponses were received before the week 1 reminder (30.6%), 120 before week 3(34.6%), 225 before the week 7 reminder (64.6%) and the remainder within 3 weeks of the final pack being sent. The median age of patients that the survey was sentto, and the median age of the respondents, was 54 years.Conclusion: In this study, we have demonstrated the successful implementation of a novel approach to postal surveys. Despite the length of the questionnaire (ninepages, 116 questions) and limitations of expenses to mail a survey to ~350 women,we were able to attain a response rate of 74.6%.DOI: 10.2147/PROM.S156109 PMCID: PMC5995290PMID: 29922103
