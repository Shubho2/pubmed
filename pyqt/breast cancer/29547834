The SBG2000-1 is the first randomised trial designed to compare individually dosedchemotherapy without G-CSF support based on grade of toxicity to standard-dosedchemotherapy based on body surface area (BSA).METHODS: Patients with early breast cancer were included and received the firstcycle of standard FEC (fluorouracil 600 mg/m2, epirubicin 60 mg/m2,cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2). Patients with nadir leukopenia grade 0-2 after firstcycle were randomised between either 6 additional courses of tailored FEC withincreased doses (E 75-90 mg/m2, C 900-1200 mg/m2) or fixed treatment with 6standard FEC. Patients with grade 3-4 leukopenia were registered and treated with6 standard FEC. Primary end-point was distant disease-free survival (DDFS).RESULTS: The study enrolled 1535 patients, of which 1052 patients were randomisedto tailored FEC (N = 524) or standard FEC (N = 528), whereas 401 patients withleukopenia grade 3-4 continued standard FEC and formed the registered cohort.Dose escalation did not statistically significantly improve 10-year DDFS (79% and77%, HR 0.87, CI 0.67-1.14, P = 0.32) or OS (82% and 78%, respectively, HR 0.89, CI 0.57-1.16, P = 0.38). Corresponding estimates for the registered group ofpatients were DDFS 79% and OS 82%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The SBG 2000-1 study failed to show a statistically significantimprovement of escalated and tailored-dosed chemotherapy compared with standardBSA-based chemotherapy in patients with low haematological toxicity, although allefficacy parameters showed a numerical advantage for tailored treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
