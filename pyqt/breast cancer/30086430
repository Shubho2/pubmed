So, we aimed to analyze the association ofneurological symptoms with CNSm.PATIENTS & METHODS: Patients with BC referred for a neuro-oncological evaluation at a cancer referral center from June 2012 to December 2017 were included.Demographic, oncological history, comorbidities, clinical symptoms and signs, andtheir correlation with CNSm were prospectively acquired during consultation in a computerized database. Analyses included descriptive observations, bivariate, andlogistic linear regression tests that compared associations.RESULTS: A total of 857 patients with BC were referred for assessment. The mostfrequently occurring symptoms included headache, focal motor weakness,focal-sensitive complaints, and visual complaints. Of the 1029 neuro-oncologydiagnoses made, the most common were CNSm, primary headache, andchemotherapy-induced neuropathy. The risk factors associated with CNSm inpatients with neurological symptoms were HER2+, younger age at cancer diagnosis, presence of extracranial metastases, and >1 neurological symptom (mainlyheadache: hazard ratio (HR), 2.1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-2.7]; visual complaints: HR, 2.3 (95%CI, 1.2-4.2); and ataxia: HR, 2.1 (95%CI,1.04-4.3).CONCLUSIONS: Clinical symptoms and cancer characteristics were correlated withthe development of CNSm. Specific risk and protective factors were identified.Among BC patients with neurological symptoms, CNSm should always be considered,especially in patients with certain oncological and clinical features.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
