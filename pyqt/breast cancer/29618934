Continuous health plan coverage without breastdiagnostic procedures was required for â‰¥13 months before the first found breastdiagnostic procedure (index event), with a 13-month post-index follow-up period. Key outcomes included diagnostic procedure volumes, sequences, and payments.Results reported descriptively were projected to provide US national patient and procedure volumes.Results: The final sample of 875,526 patients was nationally projected to12,394,432 patients annually receiving 8,732,909 diagnostic mammograms (53.3% of patients), 6,987,399 breast ultrasounds (42.4% of patients), and 1,585,856biopsies (10.3% of patients). Following initial diagnostic procedures, 49.4% had second procedures, 20.1% followed with third procedures, and 10.0% had a fourthprocedure. Mean (SD) costs for diagnostic mammograms of US$349 ($493),ultrasounds US$132 ($134), and biopsies US$1,938 ($2,343) contributed US$3.05billion, US$0.92 billion, and US$3.07 billion, respectively, to annual diagnosticbreast expenditures estimated at US$7.91 billion.Conclusion: The volume and expense of additional breast diagnostic testing,estimated at US$7.91 billion annually, underscores the need for technologicalimprovements in the breast diagnostic landscape.DOI: 10.2147/CEOR.S150260 PMCID: PMC5875586PMID: 29618934
