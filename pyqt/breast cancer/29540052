Therefore, we investigated the distribution of somaticPIK3CA/AKT1 mutations in Chinese breast cancer patients and explored their roles in tumor phenotypes and disease prognosis.Materials and Methods: Tumors from five hundred and seven breast cancer patients were prospectively collected from the West China Hospital between 2008 and 2013. Whole exons of AKT1 and PIK3CA were detected in fresh-frozen tumors usingnext-generation sequencing, and correlations between PIK3CA/AKT1 mutations andclinicopathological features were analyzed.Results: The AKT1 mutation was found in 3.6% (18/507) of patients. Tumors frompatients that carried the AKT1 mutation were estrogen receptor (ER)+/progesteronereceptor (PR)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)‒ and were morelikely to have high expression levels of Ki67. The prevalence of the PIK3CAmutation was 46.5% (236/507), and 35 patients carried two or three variants ofthe PIK3CA gene. PIK3CA mutations were associated with ER+/PR+/HER2‒ status. The prognosis of patients with one mutation in PIK3CA (or PIK3CA/AKT1) was notsignificantly different than that of patients with wild-type PIK3CA (orPIK3CA/AKT1), while patients with two or three variants in PIK3CA (orPIK3CA/AKT1) exhibited poorer outcomes in the entire group and in all threesubgroups (ER+, HER2‒, Ki67 high), particularly with respect to overall survival.Conclusion: A high frequency of somatic PIK3CA mutations was detected in Chinese breast cancer patients. In addition to the mutation frequency, the tumormutational burden of the PIK3CA and AKT1 genes should also be of concern, as theymay be associated with poor prognosis.DOI: 10.4143/crt.2017.598 PMID: 29540052
