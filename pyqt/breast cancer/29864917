Combined therapies where both agents have toxicity results in dose-limiting effects. α- tocopherol succinate (TS) is an analogue of vitamin E that exhibits antitumor properties in the absence of toxicity. Hence,its combination with a frontline chemotherapy, doxorubicin (DOX) is analternative to increase antitumor efficacy. Therefore, the aim of this work wasto evaluate the antitumor activity of nanostructed lipid carriers (NLC) loadedwith TS and DOX. The NLC-TS-DOX were prepared, characterized and radiolabeledwith technetium-99m. Cytotoxicity studies were performed in vitro, using twobreast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1. Biodistribution and antitumoractivity were evaluated in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. The results showed thatNLC-TS-DOX had a small diameter (85 nm) and a long blood clearance(T1/2β = 1107.71 min) that consequently resulted in a higher tumor uptakecompared to contralateral muscle for up to 48 h. Drug combination studies inMDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells showed a combination index below 0.8 at ED50-90 for bothcell lines. Interestingly, a high synergism was found at ED90. Antitumor activityshowed a better control of tumor growth for animals treated with NLC-ST-DOX. The small particle size, along with the EPR effect and the controlled release of DOX from the particle, associated with the synergic combination between TS and DOXled to an increase of the antitumor efficacy. Therefore, NLC-TS-DOX can beconsidered a plausible alternative to improve antitumor efficacy in DOXtherapeutic regimens.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
