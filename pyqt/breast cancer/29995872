We show here that Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1(NRF1) is a spheroid promoter by in silico identification of this transcriptionfactor as highly connected to top shRNA-hits deduced from re-iterative selectionsfor shRNAs enriched in MCF10A spheroids. NRF1-promoted spheroid survival islinked to its stimulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS, cell migration, invasion, and mesenchymal transition. Conversely, NRF1 knockdown in breast cancer MDA-MB-231cells reduced spheroids, migration, invasion, and mesenchymal marker expression. NRF1 knockdown also reduced tumor burden in mammary fat pads and lungs oforthotopic- or tail vein-transplanted mice. With the Luminal A subtype of breast cancer, higher NRF1 expression is associated with lower survival. These resultsshow that NRF1, an activator of mitochondrial metabolism, supports mammaryspheroid survival and tumor development.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0349-2 PMID: 29995872
