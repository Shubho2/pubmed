Future opportunities for personalized medicine are highlighted by the measurement of proteinexpression levels via immunohistochemistry, protein arrays, and other approaches;however, sample type, sample quantity, batch effects, and "time to result" arelimiting factors for clinical application. Here, we present a developmentpipeline for a novel multiplexed DNA-labeled antibody platform which digitallyquantifies protein expression from lysate samples. We implemented a rigorousvalidation process for each antibody and show that the platform is amenable tomultiple protocols covering nitrocellulose and plate-based methods. Results arehighly reproducible across technical and biological replicates, and there are no observed "batch effects" which are common for most multiplex molecular assays.Tests from basal and perturbed cancer cell lines indicate that this platform iscomparable to orthogonal proteomic assays such as Reverse-Phase Protein Array,and applicable to measuring the pharmacodynamic effects of clinically-relevantcancer therapeutics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential clinical utilityof the platform with protein profiling from breast cancer patient samples toidentify molecular subtypes. Together, these findings highlight the potential of this platform for enhancing our understanding of cancer biology in a clinicaltranslation setting.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.DOI: 10.1074/mcp.RA117.000291 PMCID: PMC5986246 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29531020
