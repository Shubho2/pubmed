Vitamin D affects genetranscription and may influence DNA methylation.METHODS: We studied the relationships between serum vitamin D, DNA methylation,and breast cancer using a case-cohort sample (1070 cases, 1277 in subcohort) ofnon-Hispanic white women. For our primary analysis, we used robust linearregression to examine the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)and methylation within a random sample of the cohort ("subcohort"). We focused on198 CpGs in or near seven vitamin D-related genes. For these 198 candidate CpGloci, we also examined how multiplicative interactions between methylation and25(OH)D were associated with breast cancer risk. This was done using Coxproportional hazards models and the full case-cohort sample. We additionallyconducted an exploratory epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of theassociation between 25(OH)D and DNA methylation in the subcohort.RESULTS: Of the CpGs in vitamin D-related genes, cg21201924 (RXRA) had the lowestp value for association with 25(OH)D (p = 0.0004). Twenty-two other candidateCpGs were associated with 25(OH)D (p < 0.05; RXRA, NADSYN1/DHCR7, GC, orCYP27B1). We observed an interaction between 25(OH)D and methylation atcg21201924 in relation to breast cancer risk (ratio of hazard ratios = 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.34; p = 7 × 10-5), indicating a largermethylation-breast cancer hazard ratio in those with high serum 25(OH)Dconcentrations. We also observed statistically significant (p < 0.05)interactions for six other RXRA CpGs and CpGs in CYP24A1, CYP27B1, NADSYN1/DHCR7,and VDR. In the EWAS of the subcohort, 25(OH)D was associated (q < 0.05) withmethylation at cg24350360 (EPHX1; p = 3.4 × 10-8), cg06177555 (SPN;p = 9.8 × 10-8), and cg13243168 (SMARCD2; p = 2.9 × 10-7).CONCLUSIONS: 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with DNA methylation of CpGs in several vitamin D-related genes, with potential links to immunefunction-related genes. Methylation of CpGs in vitamin D-related genes mayinteract with 25(OH)D to affect the risk of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0994-y PMCID: PMC6042268PMID: 29996894
