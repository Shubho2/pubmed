The objective ofthis study is to characterise the male population counselled through amultidisciplinary breast/ovarian program.Methods: Descriptive analysis of male patients counselled from January 2000 toDecember 2015. Data in this analysis include new cancer diagnoses duringprospective follow up.Results: From 4,320 families registered, 362 male patients were identified: 236(65.2%) from hereditary cancer families (HCF) and 126 (34.8%) from non-HCF. InHCF, 121 patients (51.3%) were mutation carriers (MC): BRCA2 - 102 (84.3%), BRCA1- 16 (13.2%), CHEK2 - 1 (0.8%) and TP53 - 2 (1.7%). Non-HCF included 126patients: 85 (67.5%) belonged to families without pathogenic mutations or withvariants of unknown clinical significance; 22 (17.5%) refused testing aftercounselling and 19 (15.0%) did not meet criteria for testing. Both HCF andnon-HCF included patients with previous cancer diagnoses: HCF- Breast Cancer (BC)- 18; prostate cancer (PC) - 13; melanoma - 1; others - 7) and non-HCF (BC - 77; PC - 20; gastric cancer (GC) - 1; melanoma - 8; bladder cancer - 1; others - 22).From the 121 MC identified (including the TP53 and CHEK2 carriers), 97 patients(80.2%) adhered to prospective surveillance. With a median follow-up of 36.9months, 17 cancers were diagnosed in 14 patients, PC being the most frequentlydiagnosed neoplasia (5 cases). Eleven patients (78.6%) are alive and threepatients died of advanced cancer (2 with GC, 1 with disseminated adenocarcinoma).Conclusion: We observed a high adherence to counselling, genetic testing andactive surveillance by men belonging to hereditary BC families. Male carriers of pathogenic DNA variants are at risk for several cancers and should be included inprospective follow-up studies.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.804 PMCID: PMC5813915PMID: 29456621
