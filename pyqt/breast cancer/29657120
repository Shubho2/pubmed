Breast cancersfollowing Hodgkin lymphoma have been relatively well studied. Breast cancersafter radiotherapy covering or nearby breasts or nipples are usually carcinomasor secondary sarcomas. Among the big cohort of patients treated for breastcarcinomas, breast lymphomas developed in the same area are not usual.Nevertheless, published studies described a significant increased risk ofnon-Hodgkin lymphoma after initial radiotherapy for a solid cancer. Here, wereport a case of a secondary breast lymphoma observed in a 53-year-old womantreated 13 years before for a ductal carcinoma and analyse such second tumorswith a review of the literature. This case report emphasizes the importance ofthe biopsy in case of recurrence in breast cancer to give the appropriatetreatment.Copyright © 2018 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO).
