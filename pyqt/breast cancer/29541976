Eachcomponent was subjected to whole exome sequencing and compared for gene identity to determine clonal origin.RESULTS: Using prior bioinformatic tools, we demonstrated that both the ERpositive and negative components shared many variants, including passenger anddriver alterations. Copy number variations also supported the two components werederived from a single common clone.CONCLUSIONS: These analyses strongly suggest that the two ER components of thispatient's breast cancer were derived from the same clonal origin. Our resultshave implications for the evolution of breast cancers with mixed histologies, andhow they might be best managed for optimal therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4742-x PMCID: PMC6002904 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29541976
