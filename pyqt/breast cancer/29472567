The premature burst release and poor degradation kineticsindicative of polymer-based nanomedicines remain the major obstacles for clinicaltranslation. Herein we prepare theranostic shell-crosslinked nanoparticles(SCNPs) using a β-cyclodextrin-based polyrotaxane (PDI-PCL-b-PEG-RGD⊃β-CD-NH2) toavoid premature drug leakage and achieve precisely controllable release,enhancing the maximum tolerated dose of the supramolecular nanomedicines. cRGDfK and perylene diimide are chosen as the stoppers of PDI-PCL-b-PEG-RGD⊃β-CD-NH2,endowing the resultant SCNPs with excellent integrin targeting ability,photothermal effect, and photoacoustic capability. In vivo anti-tumour studiesdemonstrate that drug-loaded SCNPs completely eliminate the subcutaneous tumours without recurrence after a single-dose injection combining chemotherapy andphotothermal therapy. These supramolecular nanomedicines also exhibit excellentanti-tumour performance against orthotopic breast cancer and prevent lungmetastasis with negligible systemic toxicity.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03119-w PMCID: PMC5823937PMID: 29472567  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
