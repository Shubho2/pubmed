The goal of this study was to assess contemporarypatterns of breast imaging after breast cancer treatment. Methods: Administrativeclaims data were used to identify privately insured and Medicare Advantagebeneficiaries with nonmetastatic breast cancer who had residual breast tissue(not bilateral mastectomy) after breast surgery between January 2005 and May2015. We calculated the proportion of patients who had a mammogram, MRI, both, orneither during each of 5 subsequent 13-month periods. Multinomial logisticregression was used to assess associations between patient characteristics,healthcare use, and breast imaging in the first and fifth years after surgery.Results: A total of 27,212 patients were followed for a median of 2.9 years(interquartile range, 1.8-4.6) after definitive breast cancer surgery. In year 1,78% were screened using mammography alone, 1% using MRI alone, and 8% using both tests; 13% did not undergo either. By year 5, the proportion of the remainingcohort (n=4,790) who had no breast imaging was 19%. Older age was associated withan increased likelihood of mammography and a decreased likelihood of MRI duringthe first and fifth years. Black race, mastectomy, chemotherapy, and no MRI atbaseline were all associated with a decreased likelihood of both types ofimaging. Conclusions: Even in an insured cohort, a substantial proportion ofbreast cancer survivors do not undergo annual surveillance breast imaging,particularly as time passes. Understanding factors associated with imaging incancer survivors may help improve adherence to survivorship care guidelines.Copyright Â© 2018 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.DOI: 10.6004/jnccn.2018.7001 PMID: 29752327
