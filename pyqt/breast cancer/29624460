Selected compounds in this series demonstrated better cytotoxicity and comparable hypoxia selectivity than tirapazamine. In contrast to Dox, quinoxaline-1,4-dioxidesshowed potent cytotoxicity against different MDR cells. Compound 2g inhibits ofcancer cell growth through p53-independent mechanisms. Our results showed thatcompound 2g sensitized MCF-7 cells to metformin in hypoxia. Treatment with 2gresults in the increase of ROS accumulation in cancer cells. Compound 2g can beconsidered as the lead compound for further anticancer drug design, evaluation,and development of new potent antitumor agents.DOI: 10.1080/07357907.2018.1453072 PMID: 29624460  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
