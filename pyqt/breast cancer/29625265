Electronicaddress: lihehe@hust.edu.cn.Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has been increasing across the world withincomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. We aimed to investigate genealterations and biomarkers contributing to PTC development. A total of fiveeligible microarray datasets including 94 PTC and 81 normal thyroid samples were included to identify gene expression signatures. Using integrative meta-analysis of expression data (INMEX) program, we identified a total of 2699 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (1333 overexpressed and 1366 underexpressed genes) in PTC relative to normal thyroid samples. The top 100 upregualted and downregulatedDEGs identified in the meta-analysis were further validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset for PTC with high consistency. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genesand Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed pathways in cancer, proteoglycans incancer, focal adhesion, axon guidance, and ECM-receptor interaction among the top5 most enriched pathways. Network-based meta-analysis identified FN1 and TRAF6 tobe the most highly ranked hub genes among the overexpressed and underexpressedgenes, respectively, both of which are involved in pathways in cancer. The mostenriched terms for Gene Ontology (GO) of biological processes, cellularcomponent, and molecular function were signal transduction, cytoplasm, andprotein binding, respectively. Our meta-analysis comprehensively investigatedDEGs, hub genes, enriched pathways and GO terms for PTC, which might provideadditional approaches to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying thepathophysiology of PTC, and identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets towardPTC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
