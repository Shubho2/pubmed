The use of non-toxic natural or natural-derived products has beenone of the current strategies for cancer therapy, owing to the reduced risks ofinduced-chemoresistance development and the absence of secondary effects. In thisperspective, lactoferrin (Lf), a natural protein derived from milk, emerges as a promising anticancer agent due to its well-recognized cytotoxicity andanti-metastatic activity. Here, we aimed to ascertain the potential activity ofbovine Lf (bLf) against highly metastatic cancer cells. The bLf effect onprostate PC-3 and osteosarcoma MG-63 cell lines, both displaying plasmalemmalV-ATPase, was studied and compared with the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and thenon-tumorigenic BJ-5ta cell lines. Cell proliferation, cell death, intracellular pH, lysosomal acidification, and extracellular acidification rate were evaluated.Results show that bLf inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis, intracellularacidification, and perturbs lysosomal acidification only in highly metastaticcancer cell lines. By contrast, BJ-5ta cells are insensitive to bLf. Overall, ourresults establish a common mechanism of action of bLf against highly metastaticcancer cells exhibiting plasmalemmal V-ATPase. This study opens promisingperspectives for further research on the anticancer role of Lf, which ultimately will contribute to its safer and more rational application in the human therapyof these life-threatening cancers.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00200 PMCID: PMC5994723PMID: 29915723
