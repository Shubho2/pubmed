[Epub ahead of print]microRNA-30d mediated breast cancer invasion, migration, and EMT by targetingKLF11 and activating STAT3 pathway.Han M(1)(2), Wang Y(3), Guo G(1), Li L(1), Dou D(1)(2), Ge X(1), Lv P(1), WangF(1), Gu Y(1).Author information: (1)Department of Breast Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of ZhengzhouUniversity, Zhengzhou, China.(2)The Key Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University,Zhengzhou, China.(3)Department of Geriatric Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital ofZhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.miR-30d has been shown to play pivotal roles in cancer development, and has thepotential to act as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target in breastcancer. However, the specific function and molecular mechanism of miR-30d inbreast cancer cell growth and metastasis is still unknown. The present studyseeks to shed light on the potential contribution of the MiR-30d-KLF-11-STAT3pathway in breast cancer. The results revealed that miR-30d levels were markedly increased in the breast cancer cell lines BT474, MDA-MB-231, HCC197, andMDA-MB-468 compared with the non-tumor mammary gland MCF10A cell line.Furthermore, the miR-30d mimic increased BT474 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell survival, inhibited apoptosis and increased Bcl-2 expression, whilst inhibitedBax protein levels. miR-30d mimics promote BT474 and MDA-MB-231 cell migration,invasion, and mediate the EMT phenotype. However, miR-30d inhibitors reverse all of the effects of miR-30d mimics on breast cancer cell biology. Also, we observedthat KLF-11 is a direct target of miR-30d and KLF-11 and pSTAT3 expression aredetermined by miR-30d. Finally, the results suggest that miR-30d plays essential roles in breast cancer cells in a manner that is dependent on the levels of KLF-1and pSTAT3. In summary, miR-30d appears to be a novel diagnostic biomarker andtreatment target in breast cancer.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcb.26767 PMID: 29923255
