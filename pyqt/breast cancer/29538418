At the same time, there are often core symptomsthat act as common drivers for other symptoms, such as fatigue leading todepression and cognitive dysfunction. These symptoms are termed bridge symptomsand when combined with heterogeneity in symptom presentation, are difficult todetect using traditional unsupervised clustering techniques. This articledevelops a method for identifying patient communities based on bridge symptomstermed concordance network clustering. An empirical study of breast cancersymptomatology is presented, and demonstrates the applicability of this methodfor identifying bridge symptoms.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0191981 PMCID: PMC5851541PMID: 29538418  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
