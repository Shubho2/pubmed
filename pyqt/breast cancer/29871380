The following factors were analyzedby bivariable and multivariable analysis: 1) treatment-related variables (type ofsurgery, levels of lymph node dissected, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonetherapy, and trastuzumab); 2) patient's related variables (age and body massindex); 3) pain-related variables (pain intensity, pain quality, primaryhyperalgesia, and index of widespread pain); and 4) psychosocial variables (thedegree of pain catastrophizing and vigilance and awareness to pain). Thedependent variable was degree of central sensitization measured with the CSI.Additionally, a stepwise regression was performed.RESULTS: Fifty-five (38%) patients reported signs of central sensitizationmeasured with the CSI (i.e., > 40/100). From multivariable analysis, it appearsthat more severe pain quality and higher levels of pain catastrophizingcontribute to a higher degree of central sensitization. The stepwise regressionrevealed that up to 24% of variance of the CSI can be explained by these factors.LIMITATIONS: A selection bias may be present since patients were all recruitedfrom a larger cohort participating in clinical trials on the effectiveness ofphysical therapy after breast cancer treatment.CONCLUSION: Signs of central sensitization cannot be neglected in breast cancersurvivors at long term. More severe pain quality and pain catastrophizingcontribute to higher levels of central sensitization in this population.KEY WORDS: Breast neoplasm, pain, central sensitization mechanisms, centralsensitization inventory.PMID: 29871380
