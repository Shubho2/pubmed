Ourprevious study suggests that miR-153 suppresses breast tumor angiogenesispartially through targeting hypoxia-induced factor (HIF1Î±). In this study, wedemonstrated that miR-153 also suppresses the migration and the tube formation ofendothelial cells through directly targeting angiopoietin 1 (ANG1) in breastcancer cells. There was a negative correlation between miR-153 and ANG1 levels inbreast cancer. miR-153 blocked the expression and secretion of ANG1 in breastcancer cells through binding to ANG1 mRNA. Conditioned medium from the breastcancer cell, MCF7, treated with miR-153 had no effect on the proliferation ofHUVECs, but significantly inhibited the migration and tube formation of HUVECs,which could be rescued by overexpression of ANG1. In addition, miR-153 alsodirectly inhibited the proliferation and migration of MCF7 through downregulationof ANG1. These findings suggest that miR-153 suppresses the activity of tumorcells and the migration and tube formation of endothelial cells by silencingANG1.DOI: 10.1007/s10456-018-9630-9 PMID: 29959560
