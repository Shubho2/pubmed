Due to scarcity, few large pediatric phyllodes tumor series exist. Current guidelines do not differentiate treatmentrecommendations between children and adults. We examined national guidelineadherence for children and adults.METHODS: We queried the NCDB (2004-2014) for female patients with phyllodes tumorhistology, excluding patients with missing age or survival data. Patients werestratified by age (pediatric <21, adult ≥21), and compared based on patientcharacteristics, treatment patterns, and survival.RESULTS: We identified 2787 cases of phyllodes tumor (2725 adult, 62 pediatric). Median age was 17years in children and 52years in adults. Margin positivity ratesand median tumor size were similar between adults and children. Treatment wasdiscordant with NCCN guidelines in 28.6% of adults and 14.5% of children through use of axillary staging, chemotherapy, adjuvant endocrine therapy, andradiotherapy. Five-year and ten-year survival were comparable between bothgroups.CONCLUSION: Children and adults present with similarly sized phyllodes tumors.Trends reveal high margin positivity rates, and overtreatment with regionalaxillary staging and systemic adjuvant therapies. Particularly in children,treatment decisions must consider risks of adjuvant therapy includingradiation-related second primary cancers, given uncertain benefit.TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective Comparative Study.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
