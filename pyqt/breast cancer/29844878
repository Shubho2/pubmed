DNA amplification of the 8p11-p12 genomic region has clinical andbiological implications in multiple malignancies, including breast carcinomawhere the amplicon has been associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis.However, oncogenes driving increased cancer-related death and recurrent geneticfeatures associated with the 8p11-p12 amplicon remain to be identified. In thisstudy, DNA copy number and transcriptome profiling data for 229 primary invasive breast carcinomas (corresponding to 185 patients) were evaluated in conjunctionwith clinicopathological features to identify putative oncogenes in 8p11-p12amplified samples. Illumina paired-end whole transcriptome sequencing andwhole-genome SNP genotyping were subsequently performed on 23 samples showinghigh-level regional 8p11-p12 amplification to characterize recurrent geneticvariants (SNPs and indels), expressed gene fusions, gene expression profiles and allelic imbalances. We now show previously undescribed chromothripsis-likepatterns spanning the 8p11-p12 genomic region and allele-specific DNAamplification events. In addition, recurrent amplification-specific geneticfeatures were identified, including genetic variants in the HIST1H1E and UQCRHLgenes and fusion transcripts containing MALAT1 non-coding RNA, which is known to be a prognostic indicator for breast cancer and stimulated by estrogen. Insummary, these findings highlight novel candidate targets for improved treatment of 8p11-p12 amplified breast carcinomas.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25329 PMCID: PMC5963621PMID: 29844878
