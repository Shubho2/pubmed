Design/methodology/approach In this methodological study, 1,000 Iranianwomen completed a demographic questionnaire and the 14-item Persian ABCSPS. Thescale's construct validity was evaluated using exploratory and confirmatoryfactor analysis. Internal consistency and reliability were assessed usingCronbach's α and McDonald's coefficient ω. Findings The exploratory factoranalysis revealed a two-factor solution accounting for 55.1 percent of thevariance. The two-factor measurement model had a good fit with all factorloadings greater than 0.5, which were statistically significant. The resultsshowed good reliability and internally consistency ( α=0.767 and 0.872; ω =0.979 and 0.997). Moreover, model structure was invariant across different incomegroups. Originality/value The Persian ABCSPS translation demonstrated goodvalidity and reliability among Iranian women. The results also showed that thescale had a multidimensional structure. Regarding proper psychometric properties,the validated scale can be used in future studies as a reliable and relevantbreast cancer screening attitude measure.DOI: 10.1108/IJHCQA-02-2017-0026 PMID: 29865960
