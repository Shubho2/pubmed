We review our experienceof performing SSMs and assess whether preservation of the nipple-areola complex(NAC) could have been an option for some patients who underwent SSM.METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective study were women who underwent SSMthat utilized four incision types; namely, the so-called tennis racket incision, a periareolar and midaxillary incision, an areola-sparing and midaxillaryincision, and a small transverse elliptical incision. We assessed whetherpreservation of the NAC would have been an option in SSM, based on histologicexamination of three serial cut surfaces of the specimen around the nipple,ruling out the option when evidence of the malignant lesion/s was found in atleast one of the following locations: in the nipple, within a 1-cm radius fromthe base of the nipple, or within 1Â cm from the surface of the NAC.RESULTS: We performed 193 SSMs. The cumulative 10-year local disease-freesurvival rate was 98%, with 89% of patients reporting levels of satisfaction withthe reconstructed breast, of excellent, very good, or good. We evaluated that 70 of the 193 procedures could have been performed as nipple-sparing mastectomy(NSM).CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of SSM in this series were excellent and NSM might havebeen an option for about one-third of the patients.DOI: 10.1007/s00595-018-1633-z PMID: 29468434  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
