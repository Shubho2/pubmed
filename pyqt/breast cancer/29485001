In our previous study, lycogarubin C wassynthesized and showed cytotoxicity against MDAMB- 231, A549, PC3 and HeLa celllines and topoisomerase II inhibitory activities.OBJECTIVE: We present the design, synthesis and antitumor studies of3,4-diarylprrole derivatives. Their antitumor activities and inhibitoryactivities against Topo I and Topo IIα of these compounds were assayed.METHODS: A series of 3,4-diarylpyrrole analogues have been designed andsynthesized. Their antiproliferation activities were evaluated by sulforhodamine B assay on human breast cancer MDAMB- 231, MDA-MB-435 and human cervical cancerHeLa cells.RESULTS: Four compounds showed modest inhibitory activities against the growth ofthe three cell lines with IC50 below 50 μM. DNA relaxation assay revealed thatcompound 19o showed potent inhibitory activity against Topo IIα in vitro. 19oalso induced DNA breaks in MDA-MB-435 cells evidenced by comet tails and theaccumulation of γ-H2AX foci. The ability of 19o in inducing DNA breaks mediatedby Topo IIα resulted in G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis.CONCLUSION: This work indicates that 3,4-diarylpyrrole derivatives represent anovel type of Topo IIα inhibitory scaffold for developing new antitumorchemotherapeutic agents.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1573406414666180226164049 PMID: 29485001
