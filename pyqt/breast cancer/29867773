Human MCF7 breast cancer cells "home" to the bones of immune deficient mice following intracardiacinoculation, but do not grow well and stain negatively for Ki67, thus serving as a model of breast cancer dormancy in vivo. We have previously shown that PTHrPoverexpression in MCF7 cells overcomes this dormant phenotype, causing them togrow as osteolytic deposits, and that PTHrP-overexpressing MCF7 cells showedsignificantly lower expression of genes associated with dormancy compared tovector controls. Since early work showed a lack of cyclic AMP (cAMP) response to parathyroid hormone (PTH) in MCF7 cells, and cAMP is activated by PTH/PTHrPreceptor (PTHR1) signaling, we hypothesized that the effects of PTHrP on dormancyin MCF7 cells occur through non-canonical (i.e., PTHR1/cAMP-independent)signaling. The data presented here demonstrate the lack of cAMP response in MCF7 cells to full length PTHrP(1-141) and PTH(1-34) in a wide range of doses, whilemaintaining a response to three known activators of adenylyl cyclase: calcitonin,prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and forskolin. PTHR1 mRNA was detectable in MCF7 cellsand was found in eight other human breast and murine mammary carcinoma celllines. Although PTHrP overexpression in MCF7 cells changed expression levels ofmany genes, RNAseq analysis revealed that PTHR1 was unaltered, and only 2/32previous PTHR1/cAMP responsive genes were significantly upregulated. Instead,PTHrP overexpression in MCF7 cells resulted in significant enrichment of thecalcium signaling pathway. We conclude that PTHR1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells is not functionally linked to activation of the cAMP pathway. Gene expressionresponses to PTHrP overexpression must, therefore, result from autocrine orintracrine actions of PTHrP independent of PTHR1, through signals emanating from other domains within the PTHrP molecule.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00241 PMCID: PMC5964132PMID: 29867773
