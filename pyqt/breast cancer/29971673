We aimed to assess whether opening thenew RT centers influenced mastectomy rates for breast cancer.METHOD: Breast cancer patients who underwent surgery from 2004 through 2015 were identified from the Alberta Cancer Registry. Mastectomy rates for 64 predefinedhealth status areas (HSAs) were calculated after adjusting for patient and systemfactors. Variations in mastectomy rates among the HSAs were quantified usingweighted coefficient of variation (CV). Multivariable logistic regressions wereperformed to determine associations between driving time and mastectomy use inthe entire cohort and in subgroups.RESULTS: Of the 21,872 patients, the proportion of patients who lived a ≤ 60 min drive from the nearest RT center significantly increased from 68.8% (95% CI67.7-69.9%) to 80.7% (95% CI 79.5-81.9%) during the study period. Concurrently,the crude provincial mastectomy rate decreased from 56.2% (95% CI 55.3-57.1%) to 45.3% (95% CI 44.1-46.5%). However, variation in adjusted mastectomy rates(weighted CV) across the 64 HSAs increased from 9.5 to 14.6. Factors associatedwith mastectomy included age, larger tumor size, lymph node involvement, highertumor grade, molecular subtype, lobular histology type, more comorbidities,academic institution, region, earlier period of diagnosis, and longer drivingtime to the nearest RT center.CONCLUSIONS: Opening new RT centers in previously underserved regions reduceddriving times to the nearest center, and was associated with a reduction inmastectomy rates; however, these reductions among regions across the provincewere not uniform.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6619-y PMID: 29971673
