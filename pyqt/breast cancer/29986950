To explore these parameters in patients, inMali, we measured plasma antiretroviral levels in HIV infected mothers and their breastfed infants over 6 months. We analyzed specifically, plasma's efavirenz andlopinavir concentrations in mothers living with HIV and their breastfed infants. Blood samples were collected at delivery and at month 1, 3 and 6 postpartum.Efavirenz and lopinavir concentrations were measured by LC/MS/MS. HIV-1 RNA load was measured by Abbott M2000RT at delivery and 6-months post-partum for mothersand at 3 and 6 months post-birth for infants. The median duration of ART atinclusion was 57 (0-168) months. The median EFV ratio of infant plasma/maternalplasma was 0.057 at month 1; 0.072 at month 3 and 0.048 at month 6. During thestudy period, the median breast milk/maternal plasma ratio (BM:MP) of efavirenzwas 1.16 (0.96-20.62), which corresponds to a relative infant dose of 2.46% ofthe recommended weight-adjusted pediatric efavirenz dose at month 6. The CL/Finfant EFV was 0.146 L/h/kg at months 6. All LPV infants' plasma concentrationswere undetectable. No drug-related adverse reaction or toxicity was observed inany of the infants. The two women who presented a viral load >50 copies/mL atmonth-6 had undetectable plasma drug concentrations at the same period. Thisstudy showed that breastfed infants got a low level of efavirenz but notlopinavir from their treated mothers.The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/jpet.118.249938 PMID: 29986950
