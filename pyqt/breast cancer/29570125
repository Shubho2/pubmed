A benefit ofperforming imaging as part of this procedure is that it allows sites to audittheir technique. An audit of breast cancer patients at the Glasgow RoyalInfirmary (GRI) hospital showed nodes to be visualized in only 81% of patients.Current guidelines state that nodes should be seen in more than 95% of patients. A period of investigation and review led to changes being made to the injectionand imaging technique employed at the GRI site. Following these changes are-audit was performed that showed that the node visualization rate hassuccessfully been increased to 97%, thereby meeting the standards set in theguidelines. This technical note details the results of the initial audit andre-audit, and explains the investigation and changes made to clinical procedures at the GRI site to improve the node visualization rate. The challenges that canoccur when performing breast sentinel node procedures are also discussed.DOI: 10.1097/MNM.0000000000000824 PMID: 29570125
