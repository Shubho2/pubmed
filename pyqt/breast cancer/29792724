Epub 2018 May 24.A systematic understanding of signaling by ErbB2 in cancer usingphosphoproteomics.Sidhanth C(1)(1), Manasa P(1)(1), Krishnapriya S(1)(1), Sneha S(1)(1), BindhyaS(1)(1), Nagare RP(1)(1), Garg M(1)(1), Ganesan TS(1)(1).Author information: (1)Laboratory for Cancer Biology, Departments of Medical Oncology and ClinicalResearch, Cancer Institute (WIA), 38 Sardar Patel Road Guindy, Chennai-600036,India.ErbB2 is an important receptor tyrosine kinase and a member of the ErbB family.Although it does not have a specific ligand, it transmits signals downstream byheterodimerization with other receptors in the family. It plays a major role in avariety of cellular responses like proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion. ErbB2 is amplified at the DNA level in breast cancer (20%-30%) and gastric cancer(10%-20%), and trastuzumab is effective as a therapeutic antibody. This review isa critical analysis of the currently published data on the signaling pathways of ErbB2 and the interacting proteins. It also focuses on the techniques that arecurrently available to evaluate the entire phosphoproteome following activationof ErbB2. Identification of new and relevant phosphoproteins can not only serveas new therapeutic targets but also as a surrogate marker in patients to assessthe activity of compounds that inhibit ErbB2. Overall, such analysis will improveunderstanding of signaling by ErbB2.DOI: 10.1139/bcb-2017-0020 PMID: 29792724
