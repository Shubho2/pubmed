However, subtypes ofeach of these three common, lethal solid tumors lack identified moleculardrivers, and are thus not amenable to targeted therapies. Here we show thatpleckstrin homology domain-interacting protein (PHIP) promotes the progression ofthese "driver-negative" tumors. Suppression of PHIP expression significantlyinhibited both tumor cell proliferation and invasion, coordinately suppressingphosphorylated AKT, cyclin D1, and talin1 expression in all three tumor types.Furthermore, PHIP's targetable bromodomain is functional, as it specificallybinds the histone modification H4K91ac. Analysis of TCGA profiling effortsrevealed PHIP overexpression in triple-negative and basal-like breast cancer, as well as in the bronchioid subtype of nonsmall cell lung cancer. These resultsidentify a role for PHIP in the progression of melanoma and breast and lungcancer subtypes lacking identified targeted therapies. The use of selective,anti-PHIP bromodomain inhibitors may thus yield a broad-based, molecularlytargeted therapy against currently nontargetable tumors.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1804779115 PMCID: PMC6016792 [Available on 2018-12-19]PMID: 29866840
