Some common variants inFGFR1 might be associated with its expression, and further affect breast cancerrisk. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of single-nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) in FGFR1 on breast cancer susceptibility and FGFR1 proteinexpression.METHODS: SNPs rs17182023, rs17175624 and rs10958704 in FGFR1 were genotyped in747 breast cancer cases and 716 healthy controls by SNaPshot method. Theassociations between SNPs and breast cancer were examined by logistic regression.Immunohistochemistry(IHC) was used to detect FGFR1 protein expression, and theassociation of FGFR1 polymorphisms with its protein expression was analyzed byPearson's chi-square test. Additionally, Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysiswas used to evaluate the association between FGFR1 protein expression and breast cancer prognosis.RESULTS: The minor allele of rs17182023 in FGFR1 was significantly associatedwith reduced breast cancer risk, with an odds ratio of 0.800 (95%CI =0.684-0.935). No significant associations were detected between other SNPs andbreast cancer. Moreover, rs17182023 was correlated to FGFR1 protein expression (P= 0.006), and patients with high FGFR1 protein expression tended to have pooroutcomes.CONCLUSIONS: SNP rs17182023 was correlated to reduced breast cancer risk, and wasassociated with FGFR1 protein expression. High FGFR1 protein expression was anindependent risk factor of breast cancer, and resulted in poor prognosis.Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.
