The workflow was systematically characterized and benchmarkedacross three independent laboratories using two distinct breast cancer subtypesfrom patient-derived xenograft models to enable assessment of proteome andphosphoproteome depth and quantitative reproducibility. Each plex consisted often samples, each being 300 μg of peptide derived from <50 mg of wet-weighttissue. Of the 10,000 proteins quantified per sample, we could distinguish 7,700 human proteins derived from tumor cells and 3100 mouse proteins derived from the surrounding stroma and blood. The maximum deviation across replicates andlaboratories was <7%, and the inter-laboratory correlation for TMT ratio-basedcomparison of the two breast cancer subtypes was r > 0.88. The maximum deviation for the phosphoproteome coverage was <24% across laboratories, with an average of>37,000 quantified phosphosites per sample and differential quantificationcorrelations of r > 0.72. The full procedure, including sample processing anddata generation, can be completed within 10 d for ten tissue samples, and 100samples can be analyzed in ~4 months using a single LC-MS/MS instrument. The highquality, depth, and reproducibility of the data obtained both within and acrosslaboratories should enable new biological insights to be obtained from massspectrometry-based proteomics analyses of cells and tissues together withproteogenomic data integration.DOI: 10.1038/s41596-018-0006-9 PMID: 29988108
