The present study aimed toinvestigate the effects of FOXM1 on radiotherapy resistance in human lung cancer and to explore the related molecular mechanisms. The results revealed that FOXM1 expression was upregulated in A549 and H1299 cells after IR (Ionizing radiation).FOXM1 inhibition impeded survival fractions, impeded proliferation, and triggeredapoptosis after IR. Moreover, the silencing of FOXM1 dampened cell migration,invasion, and EMT (epithelial-mesenchyman transition) in A549 and H1299 cellstreated by IR. In addition, KIF20A was also highly expressed in IR-treated A549cells and downregulated by FOXM1 inhibition. Knockdown of KIF20A inhibited thesurvival fraction. Reintroduction of KIF20A partly reversed the effects of FOXM1 on the proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis of A549 cells. Taken together,these results indicated that FOXM1 might enhance radioresistance partly throughthe induction of KIF20A expression.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
