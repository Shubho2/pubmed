Perturbations of these lineages underpin breast cancer risk, yet ourunderstanding of normal mammary cell composition is incomplete. Here, we build a multimodal resource for the adult gland through comprehensive profiling ofprimary cell epigenomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes. We define systems-levelrelationships between chromatin-DNA-RNA-protein states, identify lineage-specificDNA methylation of transcription factor binding sites, and pinpoint proteinsunderlying progesterone responsiveness. Comparative proteomics of estrogen andprogesterone receptor-positive and -negative cell populations, extensive targetvalidation, and drug testing lead to discovery of stem and progenitor cellvulnerabilities. Top epigenetic drugs exert cytostatic effects; prevent adultmammary cell expansion, clonogenicity, and mammopoiesis; and deplete stem cellfrequency. Select drugs also abrogate human breast progenitor cell activity innormal and high-risk patient samples. This integrative computational andfunctional study provides fundamental insight into mammary lineage and stem cell biology.Â© 2018 Casey et al.DOI: 10.1083/jcb.201804042 PMCID: PMC6080920PMID: 29921600
