The objective ofthis study was to investigate tumoral PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA-expression in a cohort of ovarian cancer (OC) patients in relation to tumor mutations. We analyzed mRNA expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and IFNG by quantitative real-time PCR in tissue of 170patients with low grade-serous (LGSOC), high-grade serous (HGSOC), endometrioidand clear cell OC compared to 28 non-diseased tissues (ovaries and fallopiantubes) in relation to tumor protein 53 (TP53) and breast cancer gene 1/2(BRCA1/2) mutation status. TP53-mutated OC strongly expressed PD-L1 compared toTP53 wild-type OC (p = 0.028) and BRCA1/2-mutated OC increasingly expressed PD-1 (p = 0.024) and PD-L1 (p = 0.012) compared to BRCA1/2 wild-type OC. For the firsttime in human, we noted a strong correlation between tumoral IFNG and PD-1 orPD-L1 mRNA-expression, respectively (p < 0.001). OC tissue increasingly expressedPD-1 compared to healthy controls (vs. ovaries: p < 0.001; vs. tubes: p = 0.018).PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA-expression increased with higher tumor grade (p = 0.008 and p= 0.027, respectively) and younger age (< median age, p = 0.001). Finally, in themajor subgroup of our cohort, FIGO stage III/IV HGSOC, high PD-1 and PD-L1mRNA-expression was associated with reduced progression-free (p = 0.024) andoverall survival (p = 0.049) but only in the univariate analysis. Our studysuggests that in OC PD-1/PD-L1 mRNA-expression is controlled by IFNγ and affectedby TP53 and BRCA1/2 mutations. We suggest that these mutations might serve aspotential predictive factors that guide anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24770 PMCID: PMC5915132PMID: 29707124
