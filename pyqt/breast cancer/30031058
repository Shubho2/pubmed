Therefore, it is significant to reveal the principle of breaking the subtlehomeostasis of cell cycle and sustaining chronic proliferation of cancer cells.MAIN METHODS: The expression of TNNT1 was examined by qPCR and western blotting. The effect of TNNT1 on cell proliferation was detected by MTT, colony formationand anchorage-independent growth assay. The percent of cells in different cellphase was analyzed by Flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression of genesinvolved in G1/S transition was assayed using qPCR and western blotting,respectively.KEY FINDINGS: The results showed that TNNT1 expression is significantly increasedin breast cancer tissues and closely correlated with clinical stage, T and Nclassification. Further experiments demonstrate that TNNT1 contributes toproliferation of breast cells by promoting G1/S transition.SIGNIFICANCE: Our results extend the mechanisms of controlling cell cycle and mayprovide a novel therapeutic target to therapy breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018.
