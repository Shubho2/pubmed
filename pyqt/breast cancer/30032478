There have been significant advances in therapeutictechniques for breast cancer over the past 20 years. This has been accompanied bythe concentration of services in designated cancer centres. The aim of this studywas to examine the changing cost of breast cancer management over an 18-yearperiod and identify factors underlying this.METHODS: We use breast cancer services data from Galway University Hospital in1995-1996, 2005-2006 and 2011-2012 to examine the changing pattern of care costs and survival.RESULTS: The number of patients treated for breast cancer rose from 200 in1995-1996, to 411 in 2005-2006 and 563 in 2011-2012. Two-year survival rose inline with national figures from 84 to 89.78 and 92.07%, in the three-time periodsrespectively. Adjusting for inflation, the average cost per patient rose from€14,710 (95% C.I., €13,398 to €16,022) in 1995-1996 to €30,405 (95% C.I., €38,620to €32,189) in 2005-2006, before falling to €14,458 (C.I., €13,343 to €15,572) in2011-2012. We found significant changes in the pattern of costs, with some risingin relative and absolute terms while others fell as new therapies becameavailable and/or moved off patent.CONCLUSION: Within an evolving context where services are centralised, newtherapies emerge and subsequently come off patent, our understanding of the valueof cancer therapies continues to evolve. This has important implications for the evaluation of new therapies and broader policy initiatives in this area.DOI: 10.1007/s11845-018-1872-4 PMID: 30032478
