Generally, the treatment of this peculiar type of tumor requires thecoverage of large skin areas. In these cases, electrochemotherapy treatment bymeans of standard small size needle electrodes (an array of 0.73 cm spacedneedles, which covers an area of 1.5 cm2) is time-consuming and can allow aninhomogeneous coverage of the target area. We have previously designed griddevices suitable for treating an area ranging from 12 to 200 cm2. In this study, we propose different approaches to study advantages and drawbacks of a griddevice with needles positioned 2 cm apart. The described approach includes anumerical evaluation to estimate electric field intensity, followed by anexperimental quantification of electroporation on a cell culture. The electricfield generated in a conductive medium has been studied by means of 3-dimensionalnumerical models with varying needle pair distance from 1 to 2 cm. In particular,the electric field evaluation shows that the electric field intensity withvarying needle distance is comparable in the area in the middle of the 2electrodes. Differently, near needles, the electric field intensity increaseswith the increasing electrode distance and supply voltage. The computationalresults have been correlated with experimental ones obtained in vitro on cellculture. In particular, electroporation effect has been assessed on human breast cancer cell line MCF7, cultured in monolayer. The use of 2-cm distant needles,supplied by 2000 V, produced an electroporation effect in the whole areacomprised between the electrodes. Areas of cell culture where reversible andirreversible electroporation occurred were identified under microscope by usingfluorescent dyes. The coupling of computation and experimental results could behelpful to evaluate the effect of the needle distance on the electric fieldintensity in cell cultures in terms of reversible or irreversibleelectroporation.DOI: 10.1177/1533033818764498 PMCID: PMC5863864PMID: 29558871
