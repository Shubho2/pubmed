What Biomarkers?Fabian CJ(1), Kimler BF(2).Author information: (1)Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, KansasCity, Kansas. cfabian@kumc.edu.(2)Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.Marine omega-3 fatty acids promote resolution of inflammation and have potential to reduce risk of obesity-related breast cancer. For prevention trials in obesewomen, inflammatory cytokines, aromatase, and measures of breast immune cellinfiltration are logical, as are biomarkers of growth factor, adipokine, andestrogen signaling. Where best to look for marker change: in the circulation(easiest), in benign breast tissue (most relevant), or in visceral adipose(inflammation often most marked)? A null biomarker modulation trial may reflectlimitations in design, source and dose of fatty acids, or biomarkers and shouldnot lead to premature abandonment of marine omega-3 fatty acids for cancerprevention.
