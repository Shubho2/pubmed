This is the first study to reportbiospecimen donors' views on compensation and can potentially improve informedconsent and recruitment practices.METHODS: Researchers asked patients undergoing surgical removal of tissue todonate biological materials to a biobank; the request was made at theirpresurgical appointment or in the preoperative clinic of the Emory UniversityHospital. We interviewed 126 biospecimen donors within 30Â days post surgeryregarding their perspective on compensation for biospecimen donation.RESULTS: In response to the question "Should you be paid for your participationin the tissue bank?," 95 (95/126, 75%) participants answered "No." Of these, 55(55/95, 58%) indicated that donating biological materials should be aboutaltruism, not gaining a monetary reward. Only 11 (11/126, 9%) participantsunequivocally believed they should receive compensation, while 14 (14/126, 11%)felt entitled to compensation only under specific circumstances. Eleven (11/14)"Depends" participants indicated that donors should only be compensated whenresearchers perform for-profit research. Responses varied by race and incomelevel, with whites more likely to not feel entitled to compensation and higherincome participants more likely to respond "Depends."CONCLUSIONS: The majority of biospecimen donors stated they should not be paidfor tissue bank participation. However, a minority believe they should be paidfor donating tissue if the tissue is used in revenue-generating projects. Theseresults provide some support for the current biobanking practice of not providingcompensation.DOI: 10.1080/23294515.2018.1460633 PMID: 29611768
