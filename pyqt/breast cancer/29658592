For this purpose, cell index (CI) values obtained from xCELLigence Real‑Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) DP instrument,mitotic index (MI), labelling index (LI) and apoptotic index (AI) analysis among cell kinetic parameters were used. As a result of PARP inhibitor application,there was a significant decrease in CI, MI and LI and a significant increase inAI for all the experimental groups. After application of PARP inhibitor incombination with nab‑paclitaxel, the CI values were decreased for both celllines, and the differences between the control and all the experimental groupswere statistically significant (P<0.01) for all applications. PARP inhibitor,alone or in combination with nab‑paclitaxel offers a promising treatment modalityin different breast cancer subtypes.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6364 PMID: 29658592
