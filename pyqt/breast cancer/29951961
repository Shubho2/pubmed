Byengineering exosome-producing cells, ligands can be expressed fusing withexosomal surface proteins for targeting cancer cell receptors. In the presentstudy, HER2-positive breast cancer cells were targeted with a modified exosomeproducing engineered HEK293T cell. For this purpose, the HEK293T cells weretransduced by a lentiviral vector bearing-LAMP2b-DARPin G3 chimeric gene. Stable cells expressing the fusion protein were selected, and the exosomes produced bythese cells were isolated from the culture medium, characterized, and then loadedwith siRNA for subsequent delivery to the SKBR3 cells. Our results showed thatstable HEK293T cells produced DARPin G3 on the surface of exosomes. Theseexosomes can bind specifically to HER2/Neu and are capable of delivering siRNAmolecules against TPD52 gene into SKBR3 cell line down-regulating the geneexpression up to 70%. Present approach is envisaged to facilitate genes and drugstransfer to HER2 cancer cells providing additional option for gene therapy anddrug delivery.DOI: 10.1007/s12010-018-2813-4 PMID: 29951961
