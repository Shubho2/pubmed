This study examined theassociation between geographic access to radiation therapy facilities and receiptof breast cancer treatments among early-stage breast cancer patients in SouthDakota. Based on 4,209 early-stage breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2012 in South Dakota, the study measured geographic proximity to radiationtherapy facilities using the shortest travel time for patients to the closestradiation therapy facility. Two-level logistic regression models were used toestimate for early stage cases i) the odds of mastectomy versus breast conservingsurgery (BCS); ii) the odds of not receiving radiation therapy after BCS versusreceiving follow-up radiation therapy. Covariates included race/ethnicity, age atdiagnosis, tumour grade, tumour sequence, year of diagnosis, census tract-levelpoverty rate and urban/rural residence. The spatial scan statistic method wasused to identify geographic areas with significantly higher likelihood ofexperiencing mastectomy. The study found that geographic accessibility toradiation therapy facilities was negatively associated with the likelihood ofreceiving mastectomy after adjustment for other covariates, but not associatedwith radiation therapy use among patients receiving BCS. Compared with patientstravelling less than 30 minutes to a radiation therapy facility, patientstravelling more than 90 minutes were about 1.5 times more likely to receivemastectomy (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.11) and patientstravelling more than 120 minutes were 1.7 times more likely to receive mastectomy(odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.42). The study also identifieda statistically significant cluster of patients receiving mastectomy who werelocated in south-eastern South Dakota, after adjustment for other factors.Because geographic proximity to treatment facilities plays an important role onthe treatment for early-stage breast cancer patients, this study has importantimplications for developing targeted intervention to reduce disparities in breastcancer treatment in South Dakota.DOI: 10.4081/gh.2018.622 PMID: 29772881
