Selective estrogenreceptor modulators (SERMs) make a good therapeutic effect in clinic. Because of the drug resistance and side effects of current SERMs, the discovery of new SERMsis given more and more attention. Virtual screening is a validated method to higheffectively to identify novel bioactive small molecules. Ligand-based machinelearning methods and structure-based molecular docking were first performed foridentification of ERα antagonist from in-house natural product library. NaiveBayesian and recursive partitioning models with two kinds of descriptors werebuilt and validated based on training set, test set, and external test set andthen were utilized for distinction of active and inactive compounds. Totally, 162compounds were predicted as ER antagonists and were further evaluated bymolecular docking. According to docking score, we selected 8 representativecompounds for both ERα competitor assay and luciferase reporter gene assay.Genistein, daidzein, phloretin, ellagic acid, ursolic acid,(-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, kaempferol, and naringenin exhibited differentlevels for antagonistic activity against ERα. These studies validated thefeasibility of machine learning methods for predicting bioactivities of ligandsand provided better insight into the natural products acting as estrogen receptormodulator, which are important lead compounds for future new drug design.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6040149 PMCID: PMC5971309PMID: 29861831
