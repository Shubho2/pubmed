This study,utilizing computer aided volume estimates, developed a new method using thedigital mapping of breast area and compares results to existing techniques ofbreast volume measurement and actual breast volume.METHODS: 50 consecutive breast cancer patients had breast volume calculated from mammograms [craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique views]; using breastheight, width, radius, area and compression thickness. Area was recorded usingcursor measurement tool for AGFA® Impax™6 software. The new volumetric estimationis based on the basic formula for the volume of a solid. The technique wascompared with three known breast volume estimation techniques. Subsequently, 15patients undergoing mastectomy had pre-op breast volume calculated using this newmethod and 3 existing techniques; values were compared to fresh mastectomyweights/volumes.RESULTS: 50 patients, mean age 63.2 ± 14.4 (range 38-88) had breast volumeestimation. The CC view appears to provide the best correlation with existingtechniques. Scatterplots show a significant correlation of all the methods withthe digital breast volume estimation method. Mastectomy volume compared withfour breast volume techniques in n = 15, confined to the CC, shows goodcorrelation between the digital technique and real volume. Scatterplots showsignificant correlation between digital breast volume estimation and mastectomyweight.CONCLUSION: This study provided a novel simple tool to estimate breast volume in patients. Advances in knowledge: This may aid in planning cosmetic outcome andoncoplastic approaches in breast cancer and breast reduction surgery.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20180406 PMID: 30028189
