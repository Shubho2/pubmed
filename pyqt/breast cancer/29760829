A study was designed to addressthis issue by investigating the germline mutation rate in African-American women in Arkansas with a personal and/or family history of breast cancer. Women weretested for these mutations using a large panel of breast cancer susceptibilitygenes. In this analysis, we discuss the challenges encountered in recruitingAfrican-American women from an existing biorepository to participate in thisstudy.Methods: We attempted to contact 965 African-American women with a personaland/or family history of breast cancer who participated in Spit for the Cure(SFTC) between 2007 and 2013 and provided consent to be recontacted. The SFTCparticipants were invited by telephone and email to participate in the geneticstudy. Enrollment required completion of a phone interview to obtain a family andmedical history and return of a signed consent form.Results: Among eligible SFTC participants, 39.6% (382/965) were able to becontacted with the phone numbers and email addresses they provided. Of these, 174(45.5%) completed a phone interview and returned a signed consent form. Otherswere not able to be contacted (n = 583), declined to participate (n = 57), didnot keep phone interview appointments (n = 82), completed the phone interview butnever returned a signed consent (n = 54), were deceased (n = 13), or were tooconfused to consent to participate (n = 2).Conclusions: Recruiting African-American women into our breast cancer geneticsstudy proved challenging primarily due to difficulty establishing contact withpotential participants. Given their prior participation in breast cancerresearch, we anticipated that this would be a highly motivated population.Indeed, when we were able to contact SFTC participants, only 14.9% declined toparticipate in our study. Innovative communication, retention, and recruitmentstrategies are needed in future studies to address the recruitment challenges we faced.DOI: 10.1186/s13053-018-0091-3 PMCID: PMC5937804PMID: 29760829
