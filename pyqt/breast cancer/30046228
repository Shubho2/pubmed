In this study, we investigated the associations of CTCs withclinicopathological features and metabolic-related variables, such as obesity andhyperglycemia.Methods: In this retrospective study, we recruited 264 patients withpostoperative stage I-III breast cancer at Guangdong General Hospital fromJanuary 2009 to December 2015. The prevalence and number of CTCs were assessedusing the CellSearch System at a median time of 19.0 months [interquartile range (IQR), 7.8-33.0] after surgery. The CTC assay results were correlated with theclinicopathological features and metabolic-related variables. A multivariatelogistic regression analysis was performed to further determine the independentpredictors of CTCs.Results: CTCs were detected in 10.6% of all patients. The positive rate of CTCsin patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma was lower than that in patientswith other pathological types (9.0% vs. 28.6%, P=0.020). More importantly, thepresence of CTCs was correlated with blood glucose level (P=0.015) andhigh-density lipoprotein level (P=0.030). The multivariate logistic regressionanalysis showed that the pathological type [odds ratio (OR): 1.757, 95% CI:1.021-3.023; P=0.042] and blood glucose level (OR: 1.218, 95% CI: 1.014-1.465;P=0.035) were independent predictors of the presence of CTCs.Conclusions: This study revealed potential associations between CTCs andmetabolic-related factors in Chinese patients with non-MBC and supports thehypothesis that metabolic dysfunction in breast cancer patients might influencethe biological activity of metastatic breast cancer, leading to a higherprevalence of CTCs.DOI: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.03.06 PMCID: PMC6037583PMID: 30046228
