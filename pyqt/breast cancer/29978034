We examined trends in sleep quality andduration up to 15 years before and 20 years after a diagnosis of breast cancer,over time among postmenopausal women participating in the Women's HealthInitiative (WHI). We included 12,098 participants who developed invasive breastcancer after study enrollment. A linear mixed-effects model was used to determinewhether the time trend in sleep quality, as measured by the WHI Insomnia RatingScale (WHIIRS), a measure of perceived insomnia symptoms from the past 4 weeks,changed following a cancer diagnosis. To examine sleep duration, we fit alogistic regression model with random effects for both short (<6 h) and long(≥9 h) sleep. In addition, we studied the association between depressive symptomsand changes in WHIIRS and sleep duration. There was a significantly slowerincrease in the trend of WHIIRS after diagnosis (β = 0.06; p = 0.03), but therewere non-significant increases in the trend of the probability of short or longsleep after diagnosis. The probability of depressive symptoms significantlydecreased, though the decrease was more pronounced after diagnosis (p < 0.01).Trends in WHIIRS worsened at a relatively slower rate following diagnosis andlower depression rates may explain the slower worsening in WHIIRS. Our findingssuggest that over a long period of time, breast cancer diagnosis does notadversely affect sleep quality and duration in postmenopausal women compared tosleep pre-diagnosis, yet both sleep quality and duration continue to worsen over time.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0065-7 PMCID: PMC6026122PMID: 29978034
