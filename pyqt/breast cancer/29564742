We present a singlecommunity-based institution's experience in further evaluating these cases.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2014 and 2016, 4255 samples were submitted for HER2amplification testing by alternative probes, TP53, RAI1, and RARA. Of thepatients tested by FISH, 505/3908 (12.9%) also had IHC data.RESULTS: Most (73.9%) FISH equivocal cases remained equivocal after IHC testing. However, 50.5% of equivocal cases were classified as HER2 amplified byalternative probes. Most cases were positive by more than one probe: 78% ofpositive cases by RAI1 and 73.9% by TP53. There was a significant differencebetween IHC and FISH alternative testing (p < 0.0001) among the equivocal casesby conventional FISH testing, 44% of IHC negative cases became positive while 36%of the positive IHC cases became negative by alternative FISH testing. Available data showed that 41% of patients were treated with palbociclib and were positive by alternative FISH.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of double HER2 equivocal cases and the discrepancybetween IHC and alternative FISH testing suggest that FISH alternative testingusing both RAI1 and TP53 probes is necessary for conclusive classification.Because almost half of FISH equivocal cases converted to HER2 amplified uponalternative testing, clinical studies to determine the benefit of anti-HER2therapy in these patients are urgently needed.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4755-5 PMCID: PMC5999182PMID: 29564742
