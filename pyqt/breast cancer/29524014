The Cancer Survivor Profile-BreastCancer (CSPro-BC) application (app) was developed to help address these needs,using breast cancer survivors (BCS) as a pilot group. This paper describes theapp development, BCS and nurse perceptions of the app, and changes made based on this feedback.METHODS: The CSPro-BC app was developed for use on an iPad and includes (1)administration of a 15-20-min survey assessing 18 needs, (2) generation of aprofile of needs, relative to a reference group of BCS (median 2 yearspost-treatment), and (3) provision of problem-specific online resources.Perceptions of the app were evaluated using both quantitative and qualitativeapproaches. Feedback was elicited from nurse navigators and BCS. BCS wererecruited until the point of saturation.RESULTS: BCS (N = 11) were middle-aged and a median of 2.4 months post activetreatment. Structured questionnaires indicated the following: survey coveredmeaningful problem areas, profile display was clear, and nurse's involvement was helpful. Follow-up interviews (2 weeks later) revealed that BCS shared theirprofile with others, but most BCS did not use the resources and those who didthought there were too many. Nurses (N = 3) said the app increased appointmenttime, but prompted them to discuss areas often not covered in typical BCSfollow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Feedback by end users directly informed revision of the app.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The CSPro-BC app has been optimized based onBCS feedback.DOI: 10.1007/s11764-017-0668-2 PMID: 29524014
