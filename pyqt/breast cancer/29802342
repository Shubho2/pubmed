Here, we develop an experimental and computational pipeline thatincludes 1) a Bayesian network model (AccessTF) that accurately predictsprotein-bound DNA sequence motifs based on chromatin accessibility, and 2) ascoring system (TFScore) that rank-orders transcription factors as candidates forbeing important for a biological process. Genetic experiments validate TFScoreand suggest that more than 40 transcription factors contribute to the oncogenicstate in this model. Interestingly, individual depletion of several of thesefactors results in similar transcriptional profiles, indicating that a complexand interconnected transcriptional network promotes a stable oncogenic state. Thecombined experimental and computational pipeline represents a general approach tocomprehensively identify transcriptional regulators important for a biologicalprocess.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04406-2 PMCID: PMC5970197PMID: 29802342
