As miRNAs regulate amultitude of targets, the analysis of differentially expressed proteins upon agenomic knock-out (KO) is of interest. In this study, we generated a TALENs KO ofmiR-200c in MCF7 breast cancer cells, excluded its compensation by family-membersand evaluated the impact on the proteome by analyzing three individual KO-clones.We identified 26 key proteins and a variety of enrichments in metabolic andcytoskeletal pathways. In six of these targets (AGR2, FLNA/B, ALDH7A1, SCIN,GSTM3) the differential expression was additionally detected at mRNA level.Together, these alterations in protein abundance accounted for the observedbiological phenotypes, i.e. increased migration and chemoresistance and alteredmetabolism, found in the miR-200c-KO clones. These findings provide novelinsights into miR-200c and pave the way for further studies.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25240-y PMID: 29720730
