The approval of this approach in Japan led to thewidespread adoption of DDCT, despite limited efficacy and safety data amongJapanese patients. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant DDCT forJapanese patients with breast cancer.METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, phase II study evaluated 52 women withoperable human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer andaxillary lymph node metastasis. Neoadjuvant DDCT (adriamycin pluscyclophosphamide or epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel) was administrated every 2 weeks with G-CSF support. The study endpoints were therates of pathological complete response (pCR), febrile neutropenia, treatmentcompletion, toxicities, and the relative dose intensity (RDI).RESULTS: The pCR rate was 21.9% (9/41) and the triple-negative (TN) subtype wassignificantly associated with a high pCR rate (triple-negative: 53.3% vs. luminalA: 7.7% and luminal B: 0%; p = 0.003). The treatment completion rate was 80.8%(42/52) and the average RDI was 98.9%. Most adverse events were manageable andtolerable. Six patients (11.5%) developed febrile neutropenia. Grade 3-4 adverse events were slightly more common among older patients (57%) with a low protocolcompletion rate (≥ 65 years: 42.9% vs. <65 years: 86.7%, p = 0.0062).CONCLUSION: The pCR rate for DDCT was similar to that of standard chemotherapy,although it was remarkably effective for the TN subtype. DDCT may be feasible forJapanese patients with breast cancer although caution is needed for olderpatients.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0877-1 PMID: 29948957
