The perceived utility of adjunct DBT wasscored using a rating of 0-2. A score of 0 indicating that DM plus DBT wascomparable to DM alone, 1 indicating that DM plus DBT was slightly better, and 2 indicating that DM plus DBT was definitely better.Statistical Analysis: McNemar Chi-squares test, Fisher's exact test.Results: On DM, 149 lesions were characterized mass with or withoutcalcifications, 18 asymmetries with or without calcifications, 2 as architecturaldistortion, and 1 as microcalcification alone. Adjunct DBT helped in bettermorphological characterization of 17 lesions, with revelation of underlyingmasses in 16 asymmetries and one architectural distortion. Adjunct DBT wasperceived to be slightly better than DM alone in 44.7% lesions, and definitelybetter in 22.9% lesions. Lesions showing score 1 or 2 improvement weresignificantly higher in heterogeneously and extremely dense breasts (P < 0.001).Conclusions: Adjunct DBT improves morphological characterization of lesions inpatients with breast cancer. It highlights more suspicious features of lesionsthat indicate the presence of cancer, particularly in dense breasts.DOI: 10.4103/ijabmr.IJABMR_372_16 PMCID: PMC5846217PMID: 29552533
