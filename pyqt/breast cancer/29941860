The expression analysis related toITGB2-AS1 in clinical samples was conducted on online websites. Theoverexpression plasmid or siRNA fragment was transfected into breast cancer cellsto alter its gene expression. The MTT assay and flow cytometry were used tomeasure cell viability and cell cycle. Additionally, cell migration and invasion were detected by wound healing and transwell assay. The results of biologicalfunction experiments showed that ITGB2-AS1 could promote the migration andinvasion of breast cancer. Furthermore, ITGB2-AS1 increased the mRNA and protein expression of ITGB2. Consistent with ITGB2-AS1, ITGB2 exerted the promotioneffect on the migration and invasion of breast cancer and activatedintegrin-related FAK signaling. The OL plasmid expressing the truncation ofITGB2-AS1, which was complementary to ITGB2, was essential for activation of FAK signaling. In conclusion, LncRNA ITGB2-AS1 could promote the migration andinvasion of breast cancer cells by up-regulating ITGB2.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19071866 PMID: 29941860
