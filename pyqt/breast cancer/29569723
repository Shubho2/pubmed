[Epub ahead of print]Cytochrome P450 3A Induction Predicts P-glycoprotein Induction; Part 1:Establishing Induction Relationships Using Ascending Dose Rifampin.Lutz JD(1), Kirby BJ(1), Wang L(2), Song Q(2), Ling J(1), Massetto B(3), WorthA(4), Kearney BP(1), Mathias A(1).Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City,California, USA.(2)Department of Biometrics, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City, California, USA.(3)Department of Clinical Operations, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City,California, USA.(4)Department of Clinical Research, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Foster City,California, USA.Drug transporter and cytochrome P450 expression is regulated by shared nuclearreceptors and, hence, an inducer should induce both, although the magnitude maydiffer. The objective of this study was to establish relative inductionrelationships between CYP3A and drug transporters (P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organicanion transporting polypeptide (OATP), and breast cancer resistance protein(BCRP)) or other P450s (CYP2C9 and CYP1A2) using ascending doses of theprototypical pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR) agonist, rifampin, to elicitweak, moderate, and strong PXR agonism. Healthy subjects received dabigatranetexilate, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and a midazolam/tolbutamide/caffeinecocktail before and after rifampin 2, 10, 75, or 600 mg q.d. Unlike CYP3A, onlymoderate induction of P-gp, OATP, and CYP2C9 was observed and dose-dependentinduction of P-gp, OATP, and CYP2C9 was always one drug-drug interaction categorylower than observed for CYP3A, even when correcting for probe drug sensitivity.Data from this study establish proof-of-concept that P450 induction data can beleveraged to inform on the effect on transporters.© 2018 The Authors.
