We assessed national trends and patterns of utilization of hypofractionated PMRT.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women 18 years of age or older with breast cancer treatedwith mastectomy and PMRT to the chest wall with or without regional lymph nodesfrom 2004 to 2014 were identified from the National Cancer Database. A standardfractionation cohort was defined as patients receiving 180 to 200 cGy perfraction to a total dose of 4500 to 7000 cGy over 5 to 7 weeks, and ahypofractionation cohort was defined as those receiving 250 to 400 cGy perfraction to a total dose of 3000 to 6000 cGy over 2 to 5 weeks. Multivariablelogistic regression was used to determine factors associated withhypofractionated PMRT use.RESULTS: We identified 113,981 patients who met study criteria. Overall,hypofractionated PMRT use was low (1.1%) although utilization increased over time(P ≤ .001). Older age, greater comorbidity, further distance from treatmentfacility, treatment at academic facilities, less extensive disease, and recenttreatment year were statistically significant predictors of hypofractionation usecompared with standard fractionation. Conversely, breast reconstruction andreceipt of chemotherapy were negative predictors.CONCLUSION: Because of the absence of high-level evidence to support its use,hypofractionated PMRT was uncommonly utilized in the United States from 2004 to2014, although a small increase in use was noted over time. Findings from thisstudy might be useful in designing future studies, and might serve as a baseline for evaluation of future changes in practice patterns.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
