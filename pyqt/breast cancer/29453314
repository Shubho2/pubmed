Here, RNAsequencing was performed of circulating tumor cells (CTC) isolated from bloodsamples of women with metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer, comparingcases with progression in bone versus visceral organs. Among the activatedcellular pathways in CTCs from bone-predominant breast cancer is androgenreceptor (AR) signaling. AR gene expression is evident, as is its constitutively active splice variant AR-v7. AR expression within CTCs is correlated with theduration of treatment with aromatase inhibitors, suggesting that it contributesto acquired resistance to endocrine therapy. In an established breast cancerxenograft model, a bone-tropic derivative displays increased AR expression, whosegenetic or pharmacologic suppression reduces metastases to bone but not to lungs.Together, these observations identify AR signaling in CTCs from women withbone-predominant ER+ breast cancer, and provide a rationale for testing androgen inhibitors in this subset of patients.Implications: This study highlights a role for the AR in breast cancer bone metastasis, and suggests that therapeutictargeting of the AR may benefit patients with metastatic breast cancer.
