[Epub ahead of print]Changes in Overall Diet Quality in Relation to Survival in Postmenopausal Womenwith Breast Cancer: Results from the Women's Health Initiative.Sun Y, Bao W, Liu B, Caan BJ, Lane DS, Millen AE, Simon MS, Thomson CA, TinkerLF, Van Horn LV, Vitolins MZ, Snetselaar LG.BACKGROUND: Lifestyle factors are important for cancer survival. However,empirical evidence regarding the effects of dietary changes on mortality inbreast cancer survivors is sparse.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the associations of changes in overalldiet quality, indicated by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 score, withmortality in breast cancer survivors.DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study from September 1993 through September30, 2015.PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: This study included 2,295 postmenopausal women who werediagnosed with invasive breast cancer and completed a food frequencyquestionnaire both before and after the diagnosis of breast cancer in the Women'sHealth Initiative.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The HEI-2010 score (maximum score of 100) was calculatedbased on consumption of 12 dietary components. The outcomes were mortality fromall causes, breast cancer, and causes other than breast cancer.STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modelswere used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of mortality from all causes, breastcancer, and other causes.RESULTS: Over 12 years of follow-up, 763 deaths occurred. Compared with womenwith relatively stable diet quality (±14.9% change in HEI-2010 score), women who decreased diet quality (≥15% decrease in HEI-2010 score) had a higher risk ofdeath from breast cancer (adjusted hazard ratio 1.66, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.52).Increased diet quality (≥15% increase in HEI-2010 score) was not significantlyassociated with lower risk of death. These associations persisted afteradditional adjustment for change in body mass index.CONCLUSIONS: Among women with breast cancer, decreased diet quality after breast cancer diagnosis was associated with higher risk of death from breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
