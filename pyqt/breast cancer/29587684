In this study, we explored the biological activities ofdelphinidin, the most common of the anthocyanidin monomers, that were related to autophagy in HER-2 positive breast cancer MDA-MB-453 and BT474 cells.METHODS: The effects of various doses of delphinidin on the proliferation andapoptosis of MDA-MB-453 and BT474 cells were analysed. Autophagy was identifiedas a critical factor that influenced chemotherapy, and the autophagic mechanismin delphinidin-treated cells was investigated. The autophagy inhibitors, 3-MA andBA1, were used to analyse the effects of autophagy inhibition.RESULTS: Delphinidin inhibited proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and inducedautophagy in MDA-MB-453 and BT474 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Theinhibition of autophagy enhanced the delphinidin-induced apoptosis andantiproliferative effect in both HER-2 positive breast cancer cells. In addition,delphinidin induced autophagy via suppression of the mTOR signalling pathway and activation of the AMPK signalling pathway in HER-2 positive breast cancer cells.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the results showed that delphinidin induced apoptosis and autophagy in HER-2 positive breast cancer cells and that autophagy wasinduced via the mTOR and AMPK signalling pathways. The suppression of autophagypromoted the anticancer effects of delphinidin.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4231-y PMCID: PMC5870693PMID: 29587684
