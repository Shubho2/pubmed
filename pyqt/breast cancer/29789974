We conducted a prospectivesingle-arm study to confirm the applicability of the Z0011 criteria to Japanesepatients with breast cancer.METHODS: Patients meeting the Z0011 inclusion criteria and providing consent toreceive no additional ALND were prospectively enrolled at the Osaka InternationalCancer Institute from April 2012 to December 2016. Cumulative incidence ofloco-regional recurrence was estimated and compared to that of the Z0011 study.RESULTS: Among a total of 881 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery,189 fulfilling the Z0011 criteria were enrolled and eligible for the subsequentanalysis. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 113 (59.8%) patients, adjuvanthormone therapy to 170 (89.9%), and whole breast irradiation to 183 (96.8%). The frequency of tumors with positive lymphovascular invasion (p < 0.0001) andmacrometastases in SLNs (p < 0.0001) were significantly higher in our study than in the Z0011 study. At the median follow-up of 36 months (range 10-64 months),only 2 of 189 patients (1.1%) experienced loco-regional recurrence. The 5-yearcumulative rate of loco-regional recurrences was 1.3% (95% CI 0-3.1%), and the3-year distant DFS rate was 96.8% (95% CI 94.0-99.6%).CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective study showed that it is feasible to apply the Z0011 strategy to Japanese patients with clinically node-negative breast cancerundergoing breast-conserving surgery with planned whole breast irradiation.DOI: 10.1007/s10147-018-1297-0 PMID: 29789974
