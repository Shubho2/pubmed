The action of MAO-A has been typicallydescribed in neuro-pharmacological domains. Here, we have established aco-relation between IL-6/IL-6R and MAO-A and their regulation in hypoxia induced invasion/angiogenesis.METHODS: We employed various in-vitro and in-vivo techniques and clinicalsamples.RESULTS: We studied a co-relation among MAO-A and IL-6/IL-6R and tumourangiogenesis/invasion in hypoxic environment in breast cancer model. Activationof IL-6/IL-6R and its downstream was found in hypoxic cancer cells. Thiselevation of IL-6/IL-6R caused sustained inhibition of MAO-A in hypoxicenvironment. Inhibition of IL-6R signalling or IL-6R siRNA increased MAO-Aactivity and inhibited tumour angiogenesis and invasion significantly indifferent models. Further, elevation of MAO-A with 5-azacytidine (5-Aza)modulated IL-6 mediated angiogenesis and invasive signatures including VEGF, MMPsand EMT in hypoxic breast cancer. High grade invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)clinical specimen displayed elevated level of IL-6R and depleted MAO-Aexpression. Expression of VEGF and HIF-1Î± was unregulated and loss of E-Cadherin was observed in high grade IDC tissue specimen.CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of MAO-A by IL-6/IL-6R activation promotes tumourangiogenesis and invasion in hypoxic breast cancer environment.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0078-x PMID: 29695771
