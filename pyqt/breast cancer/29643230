Thecause of early metastatic relapse in breast cancer has long been debated, withmany ascribing these relapses to the natural progression of the disease. Othershave proposed that some aspect of surgical tumor resection triggers the outgrowthof otherwise-dormant metastases, leading to the synchronous pattern of relapse.Clinical data cannot distinguish between these hypotheses, and previousexperimental approaches have not provided clear answers. Such uncertainty hindersthe development and application of therapeutic approaches that could potentially reduce early metastatic relapse. We describe an experimental model system thatdefinitively links surgery and the subsequent wound-healing response to theoutgrowth of tumor cells at distant anatomical sites. Specifically, we find that the systemic inflammatory response induced after surgery promotes the emergenceof tumors whose growth was otherwise restricted by a tumor-specific T cellresponse. Furthermore, we demonstrate that perioperative anti-inflammatorytreatment markedly reduces tumor outgrowth in this model, suggesting that similarapproaches might substantially reduce early metastatic recurrence in breastcancer patients.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science.
