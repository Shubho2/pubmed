[Epub ahead of print]Most patients are eligible for an alternative to conventional whole breastirradiation for early-stage breast cancer: A National Cancer Database Analysis.Balagamwala EH(1), Manyam BV(1), Leyrer CM(1), Karthik N(1), Smile T(1),Tendulkar RD(1), Cherian S(1), Radford D(2), Al-Hilli Z(2), Vicini F(3), ShahC(1).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.(2)Department of General Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.(3)Michigan Healthcare Professionals, Farmington Hills, MI, USA.We evaluated the proportion of patients eligible for alternatives to standardwhole breast irradiation (WBI) following breast-conserving surgery using theNational Cancer Database (NCDB). Using the 2016 dataset, Stage I-III patientswere identified. Eligibility for hypofractionated WBI (HFRT), accelerated partialbreast irradiation (APBI) and endocrine therapy (ET-alone) was defined usingeligibility from large clinical trials as well as consensus guidelines. Forpatients with pN0 breast cancer, 20.6% and 37.0% were eligible for ET-alone basedon the CALGB 9343/PRIME-II trials, respectively. In terms of HFRT, 72.5% and50.4% were eligible based on IMPORT LOW/ASTRO HFRT guidelines, respectively.Based on IMPORT LOW/GEC-ESTRO trial/ASTRO guidelines/ABS guidelines/GEC-ESTROguidelines, 72.5%, 86.1%, 39.0%, 72.5%, 45.7%, respectively, were eligible forAPBI. Of those who qualify for HFRT per ASTRO guidelines, approximately 90% were eligible for APBI and 50% for ET-alone. This analysis shows that a largeproportion of patients with node-negative breast cancer are eligible for HFRT,APBI and/or ET-alone after breast-conserving surgery.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13051 PMID: 29781235
