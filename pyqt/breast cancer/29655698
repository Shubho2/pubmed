There is increasing evidencerepresenting long non-coding RNAs play important roles in biological processes.In this study, we focused on the roles of GAS5 in the anti-cancer effects of DNC on breast cancer.METHODS: We used several methods including MTT assay, apoptosis assay, cell cycleanalysis, transwell migration assay and RT-PCR.RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in the expression of Tusc7, and GAS5 genes with DNC treatment of MCF7, MDA-MB231, and SKBR3 cells. Also, thecombination of GAS5 down-regulation and DNC treatment showed lower percentages ofapoptotic cells and a higher level of penetration through the membrane comparedwith DNC treatment alone. Furthermore, DNC induced a significant increase in the number of cells in sub G1/G1 phase and a decrease in the G2/M phase of the cellcycle. But, after GAS5 down-regulation alone opposite results was observedcompared to DNC.CONCLUSION: We observed that GAS5 down-regulation can suppress many aspects ofDNC anti-cancer effects in breast cancer cells, it seems that co-treatment withDNC and GAS5 over-expression may provide a clinically useful tool fordrug-resistance breast cancer cells.Copyright Â© 2018.
