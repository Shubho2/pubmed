Spironolactone mayrepresent an effective and safe alternative to oral antibiotics for women withmoderate to severe acne, however comparative studies are lacking.METHODS: Using the OptumInsight™ Clinformatics™ DataMart, we conducted aretrospective analysis of the frequency of switching to a different systemicagent within the first year of therapy among women with acne who were started on either spironolactone or an oral tetracycline-class antibiotic between 2010-2016,after controlling for age, topical retinoid, and oral contraceptive use.RESULTS: Among women with acne who were started on spironolactone, 14.4% wereprescribed a different systemic agent within one year, compared with 13.4%started on an oral tetracycline-class antibiotic. After adjusting for age,topical retinoid, and oral contraceptive use, the odds ratio for being prescribeda different systemic agent within one year was 1.07 (95% CI 0.99-1.16) for those prescribed spironolactone when compared with oral tetracycline-class antibiotics and the risk difference was 0.007 (95% CI -0.002-0.017).CONCLUSIONS: Based on the observation of similar switching between the twogroups, spironolactone may have similar clinical effectiveness to that of oraltetracycline-class antibiotics. While ultimately large clinical trials are neededto determine the optimal management strategy for women with moderate to severeacne, these results provide additional support that spironolactone represents an effective treatment for women with acne.
