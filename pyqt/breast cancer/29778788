Increasing evidence has suggested that patientsaged ≥ 65 years can maintain the optimal RDI for standard chemotherapy regimens. The present study investigated the RDI of newer adjuvant chemotherapy regimens inthis demographic.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 281 patientsaged ≥ 65 years with a diagnosis of ESBC who had received adjuvant chemotherapyacross 3 sites in Queensland, Australia from 2010 to 2015. The primary endpointwas the proportion of patients who had received an RDI of ≥ 85%.RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 68 years (range, 65-85 years), with36.3% aged > 70 years. The patient characteristics included tumor stage T3 or T4 in 17% and node-positive disease in 60%. The common chemotherapy regimensincluded docetaxel/cyclophosphamide (23%),5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide plus docetaxel or paclitaxel (17%);Adriamycin/cyclophosphamide/weekly paclitaxel (38%); anddocetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab (11%). Primary (15%) and secondary (54%)granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was used. An RDI of ≥ 85% wasachieved in 63% of the patients. Significant associations were noted between areduced RDI and age ≥ 70 years (P < .001), Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 1 (P =.043), initial dose reductions (P = .01), secondary G-CSF use (P = .45), hospitaladmission (P < .001), and febrile neutropenia (P = .007). Treatment-relatedtoxicities were the most common reason for noncompletion, with high rates ofhospital admissions (46%) and febrile neutropenia (22%).CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that patients aged ≥ 65 years with ESBC canmaintain an optimal RDI with modern chemotherapy regimens. Appropriate geriatric assessment and the use of supportive measures such as G-CSF could better assistselect groups to maintain an optimal dose intensity.Crown Copyright © 2018.
