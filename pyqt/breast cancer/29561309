However, the side effects of docetaxel are numerous (cytopenia, peripheraledema, myalgia, arthralgia, alopecia, and sensitive neuropathy) and recentconcerns have been raised about neutropenic enterocolitis in France. Here, wereport the case of a 57-year-old patient with metastatic prostatic cancer, whodeveloped a severe myositis and fasciitis grade IV 1 week after his seconddocetaxel infusion. We reviewed the five cases of docetaxel-related myositisdescribed in the literature, and found that most of them occurred in patientswith diabetes (n=5/5) or hypertension (n=4/5). A vascular toxicity may explainthis severe complication, and patients with diabetes or hypertension should bemonitored closely in the context of a docetaxel chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000620 PMID: 29561309
