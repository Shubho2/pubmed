It represents about 3-19% of primitive gastric adenocarcinomas,but it can also be the manifestation of a metastatic disease. Breast cancer isthe most frequent malignancy in women, and the metastatic spread to the stomachoccurs in less than 10% of the cases. We present an unusual case of gastriclinitis plastica and peritoneal carcinomatosis as manifestations of an occultbreast cancer in a 53-year-old woman. Imaging and endoscopic evaluation were not able to discriminate a primary from a secondary gastric lesion. The histological evaluation excluded the diagnosis of a primary gastric neoplasia. The IHC profilewas consistent with the diagnosis of metastases from the breast cancer. Due tothe hormonal receptors' positivity, we started therapy with fulvestrant (500â€‰mg, day 0, 14, and 28 and every 28 days thereafter by intramuscular injection). After20 months, the same therapy is still ongoing and well tolerated, while thepatient is in good condition with improvement of the dysphagia. Almost 2 yearsafter the diagnosis of linitis plastica, the primitive breast lesion is stilloccult.DOI: 10.1155/2018/4714708 PMCID: PMC6057327PMID: 30073103
