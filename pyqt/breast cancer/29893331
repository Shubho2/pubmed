Dose values to out-of-field points were calculated by TiGRT TPS. A RANDO phantom was then irradiated, and dosevalues at set points were measured using thermoluminescent detectors-100(TLDs-100) which were located within the phantom. Finally, the TLD-measured dose was compared to the TPS-calculated dose and the accuracy of TPS calculations atdifferent distances from the field edge was quantified.Results: The measurements showed that TiGRT TPS generally underestimated the doseof out-of-field points and this underestimation worsened for regions relativelyclose to the treatment field edge. The mean underestimation of out-of-field doseswas 39%. Nevertheless, the accuracy of dose calculation by this TPS for mostin-field regions was within tolerance.Conclusion: This study highlights the limitations of TiGRT TPSs in calculating ofthe out-of-field dose. It should be noted that out-of-field data for this TPSshould only be applied with a certain understanding of the accuracy of calculateddose outside the treatment field. Therefore, using the TPS-calculated dose could lead to an underestimation of secondary cancer risk as well as a weak clinicaldecision for patients with implantable cardiac pacemakers or pregnant patients.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.176423 PMID: 29893331
