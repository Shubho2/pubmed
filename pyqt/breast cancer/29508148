We investigated knowledge of breast cancer riskfactors not only among laywomen but also among female physicians.METHODS: The EDIFICE 4 nationwide observational survey was conducted by phoneinterviews of a representative female population (737 laywomen and 105 femalephysicians) aged 40-75 years, using the quota method. This analysis focuses onspontaneous replies to the question "In your opinion, what are the five main riskfactors that increase the risk of breast cancer?".RESULTS: Heredity/Family history of breast cancer was the most widely recognized risk factor in both study populations (98.1% physicians vs. 54.2% laywomen;P ≤ 0.01). Smoking (19.0 and 17.5%) and alcohol consumption (3.8 and 5.5%) wereamong the lifestyle risk factors that were cited by similar proportions ofphysicians and laywomen, respectively. Other established risk factors werehowever very rarely cited by either physicians or laywomen, e.g., Exposure tomedical radiation (4.8 vs. 0.4%, respectively; P ≤ 0.05) or not cited at all,i.e., Benign mastopathy and Personal history of breast cancer.CONCLUSION: This survey highlights a number of misconceptions relating tobehavioral risk factors for breast cancer, including the relative impact ofalcohol and tobacco consumption and the importance of menopausal status. Thelimited awareness of the risk related to Exposure to medical radiation, Benignmastopathy, or Personal history raises concern regarding compliance with nationalscreening recommendations.DOI: 10.1007/s11912-017-0647-9 PMID: 29508148
