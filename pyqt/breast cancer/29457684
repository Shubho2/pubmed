Epub 2018 Feb 19.Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast with Merkel cellfeatures.Albright EL(1), Keeney ME(2), Bashir A(2), Weigel RJ(1).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.(2)Department of Pathology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast is a rare tumor subtype comprising lessthan 1% of breast cancers in the United States. Merkel cell features within this rare subtype are even rarer. We report a neuroendocrine breast carcinoma withMerkel cell features. The patient underwent breast conservation therapy and asentinel lymph node biopsy. Unfortunately, the tumor was extremely aggressive andat 5 weeks postoperatively she presented with widely metastatic disease. Due tothe aggressive nature of this tumor, we reviewed the literature and treatmentoptions for this rare variant of a rare subtype.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.12969 PMID: 29457684
