Its overexpression correlates with worsesurvival, and antibodies to GARP appear to play a protective role in a mousemodel. No large-scale studies of immunity to GARP in humans have yet beenundertaken. In this investigation, using a large multiethnic cohort (1738subjects), we aimed to determine whether the magnitude of anti-GARP antibodyresponsiveness was significantly different in patients with breast cancer fromthat in matched healthy controls. We also investigated whether the allelicvariation at the immunoglobulin GM (γ marker), KM (κ marker), and Fcγ receptor(FcγR) loci contributed to the interindividual variability in anti-GARP IgGantibody levels. A combined analysis of all subjects showed that levels ofanti-GARP antibodies were significantly higher in patients with breast cancerthan in healthy controls (mean ± SD: 7.4 ± 3.5 vs. 6.9 ± 3.5 absorbance units permL (AU/μL), p < 0.0001). In the two populations with the largest sample size, theprobability of breast cancer generally increases as anti-GARP antibody levelsincrease. Several significant individual and epistatic effects of GM, KM, andFcγR genotypes on anti-GARP antibody responsiveness were noted in both patientsand controls. These results, if confirmed by independent investigations, will aidin devising personalized GARP-based immunotherapeutic strategies against breastcancer and other GARP-overexpressing malignancies.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.Published by Elsevier Inc.
