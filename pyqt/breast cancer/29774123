Although human endogenous retrovirus-H longterminal repeat-associating protein 2 (HHLA2) is a novel molecule of the B7/CD28 family, the clinical impact of its expression remains uncertain in gastriccancer. Consequently, we examined HHLA2 expression in blood specimens frompatients with gastric cancer, and investigated the relationship between itsexpression and clinicopathological factors to assess its potential power as aprognostic blood predictor. Untreated peripheral blood specimens were obtainedfrom 111 patients with gastric cancer and 20 healthy volunteers. HHLA2 mRNAexpression levels were determined using quantitative RT-PCR assay. Bloodspecimens obtained from patients with gastric cancer had significantly lowercopies of HHLA2 mRNA than those obtained from healthy volunteers (P < 0.0001).Furthermore, HHLA2 expression was significantly correlated with the depth oftumor invasion (P = 0.0331), distant metastasis (P < 0.0001), and stage ofdisease (P = 0.0032). The 5-year survival rate was significantly higher inpatients with high HHLA2 expression compared with the patients with lowexpression (P = 0.0001). These findings demonstrate that assessment of HHLA2expression levels in the blood could be utilized to predict tumor aggressiveness in patients with gastric cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25179 PMCID: PMC5955131PMID: 29774123
