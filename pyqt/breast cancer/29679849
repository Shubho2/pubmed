This manuscript provides an overview on the status of mBC inseveral regions of the world, highlighting the gaps in care, resources, andsupport available for patients with mBC. Primary research was conducted in 2015and 2016, comprising four global qualitative and quantitative surveys ofapproximately 15,000 individuals in 34 countries. Secondary research wasconducted using literature reviews of peer-reviewed publications, patient survey reports, and media or online articles. There have been modest improvements in mBCoutcomes over the past decade. Patients are not provided with adequateinformation about mBC. There is a need for open discussion with patients andcaregivers about realistic goals; however, physicians are not trained incommunicating with patients about their disease. Maintaining patients' quality oflife is a crucial goal; however, this has not improved, and in some cases, mayhave declined in the past decade. Public awareness and understanding of mBC islimited, with damaging consequences for patients and caregivers. Issues affectingemployment remain relevant to patients with mBC and their caregivers. Globally,mBC is associated with a substantial economic burden. Relationships withcaregivers are crucial to patients with mBC, and caregiver support needs areoften overlooked. A strong and united global effort among healthcareprofessionals, including clinicians, oncologists, pharmaceutical manufacturers,payers, and policy makers, and with advocates, families, and patients, isnecessary to improve the outcome and quality of life for patients with mBC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
