Since accumulating evidence indicates thatoveractivation of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an importantrole in the development of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertrophy andremodelling, we aimed to investigate whether letrozole alters the transcriptionlevel of RAS related genes in the cardiac tissue.METHODS: Twenty four rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6 pergroup): two groups were letrozole treated (1 and 2 mg/kg/day orally), one groupwas vehicle treated (DMSO) and one group was the control group without anytreatment. 12 weeks after beginning treatment with letrozole, we examined therate of transcription of renin, angiotensinogen, AngII type 1a and 1b (AT1a andAT1b) and type 2 receptors (AT2) in the rat heart using real-time polymerasechain reaction.RESULTS: The cardiac mRNA levels of several components of the RAS in the ratstreated with letrozole were significantly increased including AT1a receptor(80%), renin (51%), and angiotensinogen (33%). Though not significant, AT2receptor levels were observed to decrease with increasing doses of letrozole.CONCLUSIONS: Letrozole can induce significant changes in some RAS related genes. These alterations are important to understand the pathways and consequencesbeyond cardiac events induced by breast cancer treatments.DOI: 10.1080/00015385.2018.1472840 PMID: 29909753
