However, the rarity of CTCs remains a challenge. To overcome this issue, our group developed anovel technology for the isolation of CTCs on the basis of cell size difference. The present study isolated CTCs from patients with breast cancer using thismethod, and then used these cells for cancer gene panel analysis. Blood samplesfrom eight patients with breast cancer were collected, and CTCs were enrichedusing size-based filtration. Enriched CTCs were counted using immunofluorescentstaining with an epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and CD45 antibodies.CTC genomic DNA was extracted, amplified, and screened for mutations in 400 genesusing the Ion AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel. White blood cells (WBCs) from the same patient served as a negative control, and mutations in CTCs and WBCswere compared. EpCAM+ cells were detected in seven out of eight patients, and theaverage number of EpCAM+ cells was 8.6. The average amount of amplified DNA was32.7 Âµg, and the percentage of reads mapped to any targeted region relative toall reads mapped to the reference was 98.6%. The detection rate of CTC-specificmutations was 62.5%. The CTC-specific mutations were enhancer of zeste polycombrepressive complex 2 subunit, notch 1, AT-rich interaction domain 1A,serine/threonine kinase 11, fms related tyrosine kinase 3, MYCN proto-oncogene,bHLH transcription factor, APC, WNT signaling pathway regulator, and phosphatase and tensin homolog. The technique used by the present study was demonstrated tobe effective at isolating CTCs at a sufficiently high purity for genomicanalysis, and supported the use of comprehensive cancer panel analysis as apotential application for precision medicine.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8646 PMCID: PMC6006302PMID: 29928447
