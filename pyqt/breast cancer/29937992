Activating mutations in PIK3CA genepredict worse response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-positive patients,while their role is less clearly defined for HER2-negative tumors.Methods: We conducted a phase I/II study of neoadjuvant, sequential, dose-denseanthracycline/taxane chemotherapy, plus trastuzumab in HER2-positive patients andinvestigated the correlation of pre-treatment PIK3CA mutation status withpathologic complete response (pCR) and long-term outcome in a real-life setting.Results: we established a dose-dense docetaxel recommended dose of 60 mg/m2 and65 mg/m2, with or without trastuzumab, respectively, according to HER2-status,following dose-dense epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (90/600 mg/m2), every 2 weeks.The overall pCR rate was 21.4%; median disease-free survival (DFS) was 52 months and median overall survival (OS) was not yet reached. PIK3CA mutation status was not significantly associated with the pCR rate: 18% for both mutated andwild-type patients. The pCR rate was: 25% in the mutated and 24% in the wild-type(p 0.560) cohort of the HER2-positive subgroup; 33% both in the mutant andwild-type cohort of the triple-negative subgroup; no pCR neither in the mutantnor in the wild-type cohort of the HR-positive/HER2-negative subgroup. Among the HER2-positive population, a trend toward worse DFS was observed in case ofmutation, as opposed to the triple negative population.Conclusions: This study proposes an effective and safe neoadjuvant dose-denseanthracycline/taxane schedule and suggests that PIK3CA mutation analysis can beusefully performed in real-life clinical practice.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25270 PMCID: PMC6007957PMID: 29937992
