Anecdotal reportssuggest that, beyond economic and health system barriers, sociocultural factorsmay influence a woman's care-seeking behavior and resultant early stagediagnoses. To understand these barriers, we conducted 63 interviews (43 womenwith breast cancer symptoms and 20 men) in Khulna, Bangladesh. We identifiedsocio-cultural barriers like neglect and indifference toward women, women's lack of power to use resources, and reduced support from family due to stigma.Interventions must address these barriers and improve the status of women inBangladesh.DOI: 10.1080/07399332.2018.1446958 PMID: 29505392
