However, the effectiveness ofPTX is limited by resistance mechanisms mediated in part by upregulation of theanti-apoptotic BCL-2 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Present investigation wasdesigned to study the synergistic potential of NuBCP-9 and PTX loaded polymericnanoparticles to minimize the dose and improve the efficacy and safety. PTX andNuBCP-9 loaded polylactic acid-polyethylene glycol-polypropyleneglycol-polyethylene glycol [PLA-(PEG-PPG-PEG)] nanoparticles were prepared bydouble emulsion solvent evaporation method. PTX and NuBCP-9 loaded NPs displayed an average size of 90 nm with spherical morphology. PTX and NuBCP-9 dual loadedNPs reducedIC50 by ~40-fold and acted synergistically. Treatment of the syngeneicEAT mice with PTX-NuBCP-9/NPs resulted in improved efficacy than that alonetreated mice. Overall, the concomitant delivery PTX and NuBCP-9 loaded NPs showedsuperior activity than that of PTX and NuBCP-9 alone treated mice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
