It isimplicated in several processes such as proliferation and migration. Alterations in SOCE could initiate or support the development of hallmarks of cancer. In thisproject, we showed that disruption of the EGFR/ErbB2-dependent signalling bylapatinib and CP-724714, two inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),dramatically reduced the amplitude of the SOCE in breast cancer cells. LY294002and MK2206, two inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt pathway, mimicked the effect of theinhibition of EGFR/ErbB2. In contrast, inhibitors of the MAPK pathway had noeffect on SOCE. The involvement of EGFR/ErbB2 receptors and the PI3K/Akt pathway in the regulation of SOCE was confirmed in other cell lines derived from various cancer types. All these results showed that SOCE is positively regulated by thePI3K/Akt pathway and that this effect may be suppressed by the inhibition of the upstream RTKs. Inhibition of SOCE might therefore contribute to the anticancereffects of RTK inhibitors.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24685 PMCID: PMC5882317PMID: 29662626
