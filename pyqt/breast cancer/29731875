China.(2)Department of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, P.R.China.The circadian rhythm regulates numerous physiological activities, including sleepand wakefulness, behavior, immunity and metabolism. Previous studies havedemonstrated that circadian rhythm disorder is associated with the occurrence of tumors. Responsible for regulating a number of functions, the Circadian locomotoroutput cycles kaput (Clock) gene is one of the core regulatory genes of circadianrhythm. The Clock gene has also been implicated in the occurrence and developmentof tumors in previously studies. The present study evaluated the role of theClock gene in the proliferation and migration of mouse breast cancer 4T1 cells,and investigated its possible regulatory pathways and mechanisms. It was reportedthat downregulation of Clock facilitated the proliferation and migration ofbreast cancer cells. Further investigation revealed the involvement of IQ motifcontaining GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) protein expression in the Clockregulatory pathway, further influencing the expression of E-cadherin, a knownproprietor of tumor cell migration and invasion. To the best of our knowledge,the present study is the first to report that Clock, acting through theregulation of the scaffolding protein IQGAP1, regulates the downstream expressionof E-cadherin, thereby affecting tumor cell structure and motility. These resultsconfirmed the role of Clock in breast cancer tumor etiology and provide insightregarding the molecular avenues of its regulatory nature, which may translatebeyond breast cancer into other known functions of the gene.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8226 PMCID: PMC5920822PMID: 29731875
