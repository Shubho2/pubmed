The outcomes of 20 prospective data sets were comparedwith 100 retrospectively collected matched data sets derived from hospitalrecords. The preventive CSNF gel (2.5%) was administered 1 to 2 hours before eachsession on the irradiated fields. The care CSNF lotion (0.4%) was administered as7-day pretreatment after each RT session, twice daily between RT sessions, and 4 to 8 weeks thereafter. The control group was treated according to the hospitalcare guidelines. The primary endpoint was time to ARSR ≥ Grade 2 (CTCAE v4.03);secondary endpoints were frequencies of ARSR grades 1, 2, 3, and 4, recovery ofARSR, frequencies of interruption and RT stop, complications and required rescue interventions, and tolerability of CSNF.Results: Time to ARSR ≥ G2 (censoring) was significantly longer (p = 0.014) inthe CSNF group. The hazard ratio was 2.33 (95% CI: 1.15-4.72), demonstrating a50% decrease in the risk of developing ARSR ≥ G2. There was a trend to fasterrecovery from ARSR G2 in the CSNF group (100% versus 47%; p = 0.078). Theproportion of patients requiring rescue treatment during RT and follow-up wasmarkedly higher in the control compared to the CSNF group (1% to 51% versus 0% to15%). CSNF gel and lotion were well tolerated both during and after RT.Conclusions: This pilot study provides the first evidence on the potentialpharmacological effectiveness of CSNF extract in prevention of RT-induced ARSRand recovery of skin irritation in patients undergoing postoperative whole breastRT and may reflect a novel concept for prevention of RT-induced ARSR and care of irritated skin.DOI: 10.1155/2018/2479274 PMCID: PMC6051114PMID: 30057821
