Here, we aimed to explore the clinicopathologic and prognostic roles of ZICfamily members in invasive breast cancer patients using immunohistochemicalanalysis, western blotting analysis, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).Methods: A total of 241 female invasive breast cancer patients who underwentradical mastectomy between 2009 and 2011 were enrolled. ZIC proteins in 241 pairsof breast tumors and corresponding normal tissues were investigated usingimmunohistochemistry and the clinicopathologic roles of proteins were analyzedusing Pearson's chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis were also used to analyze the prognostic value of the ZIC proteins. In addition, 12 pairs of fresh-frozen breast tumors and matched normal tissues were used inthe western blotting analysis and RT-qPCR.Results: Only ZIC1 expression in normal tissues was obviously higher than that intumors (p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, ZIC1 expression (in overall survival analysis: hazard ratio [HR], 0.405, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.233-0.702,p=0.001; in disease-free survival analysis: HR, 0.395, 95% CI, 0.234-0.669,p=0.001) was identified as a prognostic indicator of invasive breast cancer.Conclusion: ZIC1, but not the other proteins, was obviously decreased in breasttumors and associated with clinicopathologic factors. Thus, ZIC1 might be a novelindicator to predict the overall and disease-free survival of invasive breastcancer patients.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.1.51 PMCID: PMC5880966PMID: 29628984
