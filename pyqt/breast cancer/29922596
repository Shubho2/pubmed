Radiotherapy modality was chosen according to anindividualized decision based on tumor features, stage, technical feasibility,age, and acceptance to be enrolled in the IORT-E group.Results: After a median follow-up of 6 years, we observed 8 (3.4%) and 1 (0.42%) LR in the IORT-E and in the HYPOFX group (p = 0.02), respectively. The two groupsdiffered in the prevalence of clinical characteristics (p < 0.05): age, tumorsize, surgical margins, receptors, ki67, and histology. 4 and 1 woman in theIORT-E and HYPOFX group died of BC, respectively (p = 0.167). OS and DFS hazardratio [HR] were 2.14 (95% IC, 1.10-4.15) and 2.09 (95% IC, 1.17-3.73),respectively.Conclusion: Our comparison showed that IORT-E and HYPOFX are two effectiveradiotherapy modalities after conservative surgery in early BC. However, at6 years a significant higher rate of LR occurred in patients submitted to IORT-E with respect to HYPOFX. This finding may be correlated to some subsets ofpatients who, depending on the biological characteristics of the BC, may be less suitable to IORT-E.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00207 PMCID: PMC5996045PMID: 29922596
