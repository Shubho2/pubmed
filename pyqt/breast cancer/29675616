Each breast cancer subscale item was reassigned to oneof the other subscales. Longitudinal changes in FACT-B responses and covariateeffects were investigated.RESULTS: The IRT model could describe both item-level and subscale-level FACT-Bdata. Non-Asian patients showed better baseline social/family and functionalwell-being than Asian patients. Moreover, patients with Eastern CooperativeOncology Group performance status of 0 had better baseline physical andfunctional well-being. Well-being was described as initially increasing ordecreasing before reaching a steady-state, which varied substantially betweenpatients and subscales. T-DM1 exposure was not related to any of the latentvariables. Physical well-being worsening was identified incapecitabine-plus-lapatinib-treated patients, whereas T-DM1-treated patientstypically stayed stable.CONCLUSION: The developed framework provides a thorough description of FACT-Blongitudinal data. It acknowledges the multi-dimensional nature of thequestionnaire and allows covariate and exposure effects to be evaluated onresponses.DOI: 10.1007/s11095-018-2403-8 PMCID: PMC5908825PMID: 29675616
