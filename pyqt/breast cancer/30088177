'PABC' is defined as breast cancer diagnosed duringpregnancy or within 1Â year after delivery. Other patients were defined as'non-PABC' patients.RESULTS: In non-PABC patients, luminal A subtype was the most common (50.2%). In PABC patients, TNBC was the most common (40.4%) subtype, while luminal Acomprised 21.2% and HER2 subtype comprised 17.3%. There was a significantdifference in overall survival (OS). In non-PABC patients, TNBC had the highestHR (HR 2.3, 95% CI 2.1-2.6). In PABC patients, the luminal B subtype (HR+HER2-high Ki67) had the highest HR at 7.0 (95% CI 1.7-29.1). In multivariateanalysis of OS by subtypes, PABC patients had significantly higher HR thannon-PABC patients in the HER2 subtype (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.7) and luminal Bsubtype (HR+ HER2-high Ki67) (HR 4.4, 95% CI 1.6-12.3).CONCLUSION: PABC showed different biologic features than non-PABC. PABC had aparticularly poor prognosis in the luminal B (HR+ HER2-highKi67) and HER2subtypes. To improve the prognosis of PABC, treatment should be consideredaccording to subtype. Development of drugs that can be used during pregnancy isneeded.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4908-6 PMID: 30088177
