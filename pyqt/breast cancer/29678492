HMGA1 protein binds to DNA, but recentstudies have shown it exerts novel functions through RNA-binding. Our previousstudies have shown that sequence-specific RNA-binding of HMGA1a inducesexon-skipping of Presenilin-2 exon 5 in sporadic Alzheimer disease. Here we show that HMGA1a induced exon-skipping of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) gene andincreased ERα46 mRNA expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. An RNA-decoy ofHMGA1a efficiently blocked this event and reduced ERα46 protein expression.Blockage of HMGA1a RNA-binding property consequently induced cell growth through reduced ERα46 expression in MCF-7 cells and increased sensitivity to tamoxifen inthe tamoxifen-resistant cell line, MCF-7/TAMR1. Stable expression of an HMGA1aRNA-decoy in MCF-7 cells exhibited decreased ERα46 protein expression andincreased estrogen-dependent tumor growth when these cells were implanted in nudemice. These results show HMGA1a is involved in alternative splicing of the ERαgene and related to estrogen-related growth as well as tamoxifen sensitivity inMCF-7 breast cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
