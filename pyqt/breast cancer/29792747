These studies were from a large cohort ofABUS-screened patients interpreted as BI-RADS density C or D. Each readerinterpreted each case twice in a counterbalanced study, once without the CADsystem and once with it, separated by 4 weeks. For each case, each readeridentified abnormal findings and reported BI-RADS assessment category and levelof suspicion for breast cancer. Interpretation time was recorded. Level ofsuspicion data were compared to evaluate diagnostic accuracy by means of theDorfman-Berbaum-Metz method of jackknife with ANOVA ROC analysis. Interpretation times were compared by ANOVA.RESULTS: The ROC AUC was 0.848 with the CAD system, compared with 0.828 withoutit, for a difference of 0.020 (95% CI, -0.011 to 0.051) and was statisticallynoninferior to the AUC without the CAD system with respect to a margin of -0.05(p = 0.000086). The mean interpretation time was 3 minutes 33 seconds per casewithout the CAD system and 2 minutes 24 seconds with it, for a difference of 1minute 9 seconds saved (95% CI, 44-93 seconds; p = 0.000014), or a reduction ininterpretation time to 67% of the time without the CAD system.CONCLUSION: Use of the concurrent-read CAD system for interpretation of screeningABUS studies of women with dense breast tissue who do not have symptoms isexpected to make interpretation significantly faster and produce noninferiordiagnostic accuracy compared with interpretation without the CAD system.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.18.19516 PMID: 29792747
