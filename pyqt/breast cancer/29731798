The Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for non-operabletumors. The Ki67 is a proliferation marker that can be used to predict thetherapeutic response to chemotherapy and the patients' prognosis.Methods: This retrospective study was carried out on 55 consecutive patients withbreast cancer referred to a Training Tertiary Healthcare Center in Kerman, Iransince 2009 to 2014. After diagnostic approval, the tissue samples of patientswere examined for estrogen and progesterone receptors, ki67 and HER2-neu markers by using immunohistochemical staining. Then the patients were treated with 6cycles of Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens by Doxorubicin and Taxans or 4chemotherapy cycles, containing Anthracycline and Cyclophosphamide and 4 cyclesof Paclitaxel. After mastectomy, their samples were reexamined for ki67 again andclassified into three groups (low: ki67<15%), medium (Ki67 = 16-30%) and high(Ki67> 30%).Results: Before chemotherapy, 54.5% of the patients had high expression of Ki67. But after chemotherapy, 52.7 of the patients had complete therapeutic responseshowing that the Ki67 level was reduced significantly (P=0.003).Conclusion: Before and after Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Ki67 measurements may beused as a predictive marker of therapeutic response.PMCID: PMC5929391PMID: 29731798
