Traditionally, reconstruction is not offered due to concerns abouttreatment delay, margin positivity, recurrence, and poor long-term survival.There is a paucity of literature, however, evaluating whether immediate breastreconstruction (IBR) is associated with greater mortality in patients with IBC. Apopulation-based study was conducted via the SEER-Medicare-linked database(1991-2009). Female patients greater than 65 years were reviewed who hadmastectomy and reconstruction claims for nonmetastatic IBC. Competing risk andCox regression were used to assess whether IBR was associated with higher breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) or overall mortality (OM). Among 552 936patients, 1472 (median age 74 years) were diagnosed with IBC and had amastectomy. Forty-four patients (3%) underwent IBR. Younger age, a lower Charlsoncomorbidity score, and a greater median income were predictors of IBR use. Tumor grade, hormone receptor status, and lymph node status were independent predictorsof adjusted OM and BCSM. There was no difference by IBR status in BCSM orcovariate-adjusted BCSM (sHR 1.04; CI 0.71-1.54; P = .83 and sHR 1.13; CI0.84-1.93; P = .58, respectively). Cumulative incidence of OM was lower among IR patients (P = .013), and IR did not influence the cumulative incidence of BCSM(P = .91). IBR was not associated with increased overall and BCSM mortality.Although further study of IBR in the IBC setting may be of value, these datasuggest that IBC should not be considered an absolute contraindication to IBR.© 2018 The Authors.
