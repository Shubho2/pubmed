Changes in its expression are associated with theexcessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus contributing tomitochondrial dysfunction and age-related pathologies. Hyperoxic treatment (i.e. generator of ROS) was shown to support some tumourigenic properties, but finally suppresses growth of certain mammary carcinoma cells. Due to strikingly reducedSirt3 level in many breast cancer cell lines, we aimed to clarify the effect ofde novo Sirt3 expression upon hyperoxic treatment in the human MCF-7 breastcancer cells. De novo expression of Sirt3 decreased metabolic activity andcellular growth of MCF-7 cells, reduced expression of proangiogenic andepithelial mesenchymal transition genes, induced metabolic switch from glycolysisto oxidative phosphorylation, and decreased abundance of senescent cells. Theseeffects were enhanced upon hyperoxic treatment: induction of DNA damage andupregulation of p53, with an increase of ROS levels followed by mitochondrial andantioxidant dysfunction, resulted in additional reduction of metabolic activityand inhibition of cellular growth and survival. The mitigation of tumorigenicproperties and enhancement of the susceptibility of the MCF-7 breast cancer cellsto the hyperoxic treatment upon de novo Sirt3 expression indicates that thesefactors, individually and in combination, should be further explored in vitro andparticularly in vivo, as an adjuvant tumour therapy in breast cancermalignancies.DOI: 10.1080/10715762.2018.1462495 PMID: 29683756
