[Epub ahead of print]Synthetic MUC1 Antitumor Vaccine with Incorporated 2,3-Sialyl-T CarbohydrateAntigen Inducing Strong Immune Responses with Isotype Specificity.Straßburger D(1), Glaffig M(1), Stergiou N(2), Bialas S(1), Besenius P(1),Schmitt E(2), Kunz H(1).Author information: (1)Institut für Organische Chemie, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,Duesbergweg 10-14, 55128, Mainz, Germany.(2)Institut für Immunologie, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, ObereZahlbacher Strasse 67, 55101, Mainz, Germany.The endothelial glycoprotein MUC1 is known to underlie alterations in cancer bymeans of aberrant glycosylation accompanied by changes in morphology. The heavilyshortened glycans induce a collapse of the peptide backbone and enableaccessibility of the latter to immune cells, rendering it a tumor-associatedantigen. Synthetic vaccines based on MUC1 tandem repeat motifs, comprisingtumor-associated 2,3-sialyl-T antigen, conjugated to the immunostimulatingtetanus toxoid, are reported herein. Immunization with these vaccines in a simplewater/oil emulsion produced a strong immune response in mice to which stimulationwith complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was not superior. In both cases, highlevels of IgG1 and IgG2a/b were induced in C57BL/6 mice. Additional glycosylationin the immunodominant PDTRP domain led to improved binding of the inducedantisera to MCF-7 breast tumor cells, compared with that of the monoglycosylated peptide vaccine.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
