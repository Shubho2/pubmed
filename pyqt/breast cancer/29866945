[Epub ahead of print]The Importance of Distinguishing Sporadic Cancers from Those Related to CancerPredisposing Germline Mutations.Sorscher S(1).Author information: (1)Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USAssorsche@wakehealth.edu.Choosing the optimal therapy for a patient's cancer has long been based onwhether the cancer demonstrates a predictive marker of efficacy. The U.S. Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) has now approved use of a targeted therapy basedsolely on tumor molecular markers (pembrolizumab for tumors with deficientmismatch repair [MMR] and high microsatellite instability [MSI]) and approvedanother therapy based solely on a germline mutation as the predictive marker ofbenefit (olaparib for BRCA carriers with ovarian or breast cancer) [New Engl JMed 2017;377:1409-1412, N Engl J Med 2012;366:1382-1392, N Eng J Med2017;377:523-533].Here, a patient is presented with a molecular diagnosis ofLynch syndrome and with breast cancer. Yet the breast cancer showed proficientexpression of the same MMR gene found to be mutated in her germline testing. The case underscores the importance of tumor testing for MMR and MSI and of notassuming that the tumor is related to the Lynch syndrome rather than beingsporadic. This is particularly true in patients with cancers (e.g., breastcancer) whose association with Lynch syndrome is not well established.The casepresented also underscores the importance of considering next-generationsequencing of the tumor when the therapies approved are based on a germlinemutation being the predictive marker. For example, the FDA-approved use of thePARP inhibitor olaparib is for ovarian or breast cancers in patients harboring a BRCA germline mutation [N Engl J Med 2012;366:1382-1392, N Eng J Med2017;377:523-533]. Yet patients with tumors lacking BRCA loss of heterozygosity(LOH) or lacking other evidence of probable loss of normal BRCA gene productexpression might be less likely to benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy, becausethe efficacy of PARP inhibitor therapy in patients with germline BRCA mutationswould likely be predicated upon BRCA LOH in their tumors.KEY POINTS: Cancers inpatients with germline mutations may be sporadic and unrelated to the germlinemutation.Lynch syndrome is due to a germline mutated mismatch repair (MMR) gene. Cancers resulting from the germline MMR gene mutation as the predisposing eventwould be expected to be MMR deficient (dMMR) and microsatellite instability high (MSI-H). Sporadic cancers in patients with Lynch syndrome would be expected to beMMR proficient or microsatellite stable.Pembrolizumab is only approved for solid tumors demonstrating dMMR/MSI-H. Thus, whether the cancer tissue of origin isclearly associated with Lynch syndrome or not yet clearly established as a Lynch syndrome-related cancer (e.g., breast cancer), establishing the tumor to bedMMR/MSI-H is necessary to predict possible benefit and endorse the use ofpembrolizumab.Ovarian cancers that develop in BRCA germline mutation carriers areso often related to the inherited mutated BRCA as the predisposing factor thattesting the tumor for the footprint of BRCA-related ovarian cancer (BRCA loss of heterozygosity) is not necessary for use of the PARP inhibitor therapy olaparib. Future studies that include tumor evaluation for normal BRCA expression orsurrogates of normal BRCA gene product expression might help determine whichpatients harboring a germline BRCA mutation are most likely to benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy.Â© AlphaMed Press 2018.DOI: 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0681 PMID: 29866945
