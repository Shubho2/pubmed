Most BRONJ occurs in multiple myeloma ormetastatic breast cancer patients treated with bisphosphonate/chemotherapeuticcombination therapies. Cyclophosphamide (CY), an alkylating chemotherapeuticdrug, is used to treat multiple myeloma, although its use has been recentlyreduced. The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of CY dose on toothextraction socket healing when CY is used with or without bisphosphonate in mice.Low-dose CY (50 mg/kg; CY-L), moderate-dose CY (100 mg/kg; CY-M), high-dose CY(150 mg/kg; CY-H), and bisphosphonate [Zometa (ZA): 0.05 mg/kg] were administeredfor 7 weeks. Each dose of CY and ZA in combination was also administered for7 weeks. Both maxillary first molars were extracted at 3 weeks after theinitiation of drug administration. Euthanasia was performed at 4 weekspost-extraction. Gross wound healing, microcomputed tomography analysis,histomorphometry, and immunohistochemistry were used to quantitatively evaluateosseous and soft tissue wound healing of tooth extraction sockets. ZA monotherapyinduced no BRONJ-like lesions in mice. CY monotherapy rarely induced open wounds,though delayed osseous wound healing occurred in a CY dose-dependent manner. Incontrast, CY/ZA combination therapy prevalently induced BRONJ-like lesions withcompromised osseous and soft tissue healing in a CY dose-dependent manner.Interestingly, anti-angiogenesis was noted regardless of CY dose and ZAadministration, even though only CY-M/ZA and CY-H/ZA combination therapiesinduced BRONJ-like lesions. Our findings suggest that high-dose CY may beassociated with the development of BRONJ following tooth extraction only when CY is used together with ZA. In addition to anti-angiogenesis, other factors maycontribute to the pathoetiology of BRONJ.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bone.2018.05.001 PMID: 29729428
