The aim of this study was to analyze if the introduction ofmammographic screening programs reduced BC mortality in the Veneto region, Italy,despite already widespread spontaneous access to mammography.METHODS: In Veneto, screening was introduced in different years between 1999 and 2009 across 21 local health units (LHUs), inviting asymptomatic women aged 50-69 years to undergo mammography biennially. We compared BC mortality for the1995-2014 period of women aged 40-49 and 50-74 years who were resident in LHUswhere screening programs started in 2003 (early LHUs) with women resident in LHUswhere screening was introduced later (late LHUs). Poisson regression models were applied to incidence-based mortality (IBM), including only deaths from BC arisingwithin the screening period.RESULTS: In the prescreening period and until 2010, BC mortality rates in earlyand late LHUs were similar in both age groups. In the last study period(2010-2014), we observed a 10% decrease in overall BC mortality in early comparedto late LHU, limited to women aged 50-74 years. IBM was reduced by 8% (95% CI1%-16%) in the overall study period and by 16% (6%-25%) in 2010-2014.CONCLUSIONS: In the Veneto region, screening programs were associated with asignificant impact on BC-specific mortality; such effect appeared at least 8years after screening implementation.DOI: 10.1177/0300891618792439 PMID: 30079815
