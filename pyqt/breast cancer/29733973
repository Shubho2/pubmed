Recently, in vitro antitumor effect of a new A10 analog [3-(4-methoxybenzoylamino)-2,6-piperidinedione] (MPD) has been verified. However,poor aqueous solubility represents an obstacle towards intravenous formulation ofMPD and impedes successful in vivo antitumor activity. To surmount suchlimitation, MPD microemulsion (MPDME) was developed. A 3122 full factorial designusing Design-Expert® software was adopted to study the influence of differentparameters and select the optimum formulation (MPDME1). Transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) displayed spherical droplets of MPDME1. The cytotoxicity ofMPDME1 in Michigan Cancer Foundation 7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cell line exceededthat of MPD solution (MPDS) and tamoxifen. Compatibility with injectablediluents, in vitro hemolytic studies and in vivo histopathological examinationconfirmed the safety of parenteral application of MPDME1. Molecular dockingresults showed almost same binding affinity of A10, MPD and 125I-MPD with histonedeacetylase 8 (HDAC8) receptor. Accordingly, radioiodination of MPDME1 and MPDSwas done via direct electrophilic substitution reaction. Biodistribution of125I-MPDME1 and 125I-MPDS in normal and tumor (ascites and solid) bearing miceshowed high accumulation of 125I-MPDME1 in tumor tissues. Overall, the resultsproved that MPDME represents promising parenteral delivery system capable ofimproving antineoplastic activity of MPD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
