There are distinct benefits of tomosynthesis over mammography with radiologists having fewer false positives andmore accurate detections; yet there is a significant and meaningful disadvantage with tomosynthesis in that it takes longer to evaluate each patient. This addedtime can dramatically impact workflow and have negative attentional and cognitiveimpacts on interpretation of medical images. To better understand the nature ofsegmented-3D visual search and the implications for radiology, the current study looked to establish a new testing platform that could reliably examinedifferences between 2D and segmented-3D search.Results: In Experiment 1, both professionals (radiology residents and certifiedradiologists) and non-professionals (undergraduate students) were found to havefewer false positives and were more accurate in segmented-3D displays, but at thecost of taking significantly longer in search. Experiment 2 tested a second groupof non-professional participants, using a background that more closely resembled a mammogram, and replicated the results of Experiment 1-search was more accurate and there were fewer false alarms in segmented 3D displays but took more time.Conclusion: The results of Experiments 1 and 2 matched the performance patternsfound in previous radiology studies and in the clinic, suggesting this novelexperimental paradigm potentially provides a flexible and cost-effective toolthat can be utilized with non-professional populations to inform relevant visual search performance. From an academic perspective, this paradigm holds promise forexamining the nature of segmented-3D visual search.DOI: 10.1186/s41235-018-0103-x PMCID: PMC5999688PMID: 29963605
