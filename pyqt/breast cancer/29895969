[Epub ahead of print]Inhibition of maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase with OTSSP167 displayspotent anti-leukemic effects in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Zhang Y(1), Zhou X(1), Li Y(1), Xu Y(1), Lu K(1), Li P(1), Wang X(2)(3).Author information: (1)Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, China.(2)Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250021, China. xinw@sdu.edu.cn.(3)School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China.xinw@sdu.edu.cn.TP53 pathway defects contributed to therapy resistance and adverse clinicaloutcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which represents an unmet clinicalneed with few therapeutic options. Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase(MELK) is a novel oncogene, which plays crucial roles in mitotic progression and stem cell maintenance. OTSSP167, an orally administrated inhibitor targetingMELK, is currently in a phase I/II clinical trial in patients with advancedbreast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. Yet, no investigation has beenelucidated to date regarding the oncogenic role of MELK and effects of OTSSP167in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Previous studies confirmed MELK inhibitionabrogated cancer cell survival via p53 signaling pathway. Thus, we aimed todetermine the biological function of MELK and therapeutic potential of OTSSP167in CLL. Herein, MELK over-expression was observed in CLL cells, and correlatedwith higher WBC count, advanced stage, elevated LDH, increased Î²2-MG level,unmutated IGHV, positive ZAP-70, deletion of 17p13 and inferior prognosis of CLL patients. In accordance with functional enrichment analyses in gene expressionprofiling, CLL cells with depletion or inhibition of MELK exhibited impaired cellproliferation, enhanced fast-onset apoptosis, induced G2/M arrest, attenuatedcell chemotaxis and promoted sensitivity to fludarabine and ibrutinib. However,gain-of-function assay showed increased cell proliferation and cell chemotaxis.In addition, OTSSP167 treatment reduced phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2. Itdecreased FoxM1 phosphorylation, expression of FoxM1, cyclin B1 and CDK1, whileup-regulating p53 and p21 expression. Taken together, MELK served as a candidate of therapeutic target in CLL. OTSSP167 exhibits potent anti-tumor activities inCLL cells, highlighting a novel molecule-based strategy for leukemicinterventions.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0333-x PMID: 29895969
