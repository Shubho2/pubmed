This study aimed to test the linear and potential nonlineardose-response associations of the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), as beingrepresentative of inflammatory features of the diet, and site-specific cancerrisk. A systematic search was conducted with the use of PubMed and Scopus from2014 to November 2017. Prospective cohort or case-control studies reporting therisk estimates of any cancer type for ≥3 categories of the DII were selected.Studies that reported the association between continuous DII score and cancerrisk were also included. Pooled RRs were calculated by using a random-effectsmodel. Eleven prospective cohort studies (total n = 1,187,474) with 28,614incident cases and 29 case-control studies with 19,718 cases and 33,229 controls were identified. The pooled RRs for a 1-unit increment in the DII were asfollows: colorectal cancer, 1.06 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.08; I2 = 72.5%; n = 9); breast cancer, 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.07; I2 = 84.0%; n = 7); prostate cancer, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.15; I2 = 56.2%; n = 6); pancreatic cancer, 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.28; I2 = 61.6%; n = 2); ovarian cancer, 1.08 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.13; I2 = 0%; n = 2);esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 1.24 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.38; I2 = 64.3%; n = 2);renal cell carcinoma, 1.08 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.13; I2 = 0%; n = 2); and esophagealadenocarcinoma, 1.26 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.39; I2 = 0%; n = 2). A nonlineardose-response meta-analysis showed that, after a somewhat unchanged risk withininitial scores of the DII, the risk of colorectal cancer increased linearly with increasing DII score. In the analyses of breast and prostate cancers, the riskincreased with a very slight trend with increasing DII score. In conclusion, the results showed that dietary habits with high inflammatory features might increasethe risk of site-specific cancers.DOI: 10.1093/advances/nmy015 PMCID: PMC6054175 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 30032224
