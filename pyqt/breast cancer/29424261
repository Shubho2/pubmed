Areas covered: This review focuses on the evolving concept of themicroenvironment as the critical participant in each step of the multi-stageprocess of malignant progression. Currently, only a small number of moleculesform part of routine molecular diagnostics in breast caner, butmicroenvironment-derived biomarkers are potential additions to existingpredictive and prognostic marker panels. The authors discuss the dependency ofthe breast tumor cells on different components of the microenvironment for their survival, dissemination, dormancy and establishment in secondary sites to formovert metastasis, as well as the potential as a therapeutic target to improvebreast cancer outcome. Expert commentary: Despite the importance in thedevelopment of breast cancer, the contribution of the microenvironment is notconsidered in routine diagnostic testing or informing therapeutic decisions.However, introduction of immunotherapy will increasingly require patientselection based on the stromal composition of the primary breast tumor. Betterunderstanding of the role of specific microenvironment-derived molecules islikely to inform personalized therapy, leading to improved patient outcome.DOI: 10.1080/14737159.2018.1439382 PMID: 29424261
