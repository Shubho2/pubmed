Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) may serve a function in the pathogenesis and development ofbreast cancer. However, the detection rate of HPV16 in breast carcinoma may vary by region. In the present study, the expression of HPV16 E7 in paraffin-embedded tissues from patients with breast cancer from North China was detected.Additionally, the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of HPV16 E7 in theproliferation of breast cancer cells were examined. The results demonstrated thatthe DNA of HPV16 E7 was detected in 30.5% of the samples, and that HPV16 E7promoted the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.Additionally, HPV16 E7-mediated proliferation of breast cancer cells wassuppressed in response to treatment with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-specific small interfering RNA and celecoxib. The results of the present study revealed thatHPV16 E7 may promote the proliferation of breast cancer cells by upregulatingCOX-2, suggesting that COX-2 may be a potential therapeutic target for HPV16E7-mediated progression of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8624 PMCID: PMC6006466PMID: 29928417
