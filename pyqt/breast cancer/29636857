Previous researchshowed that abnormal expression of miRNAs was closely related to the occurrence, metastasis, and angiogenesis of breast cancer. And in this study, the abnormalexpression of miR-22 was detected by RT-PCR in the paired breast cancer tissuesand adjacent non-tumor tissues. CCK-8 and wound healing assays were performed to evaluate the effects of the proto-oncogene ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) on the growthand metastasis of breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The results showed that miR-22inhibited the growth and metastasis of MCF-7 cells by down-regulating theexpression of ACLY. In conclusion, this study elucidated the roles of miR-22 inregulation of breast cancer differentiation and migration, which provides atarget for early diagnose and therapy of breast cancer.PMCID: PMC5883108PMID: 29636857
