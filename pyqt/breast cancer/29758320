Given that approximately half of all IMTcases have anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, the ALK inhibitorcrizotinib is suggested as a promising treatment for unresectable cases. Noreports on neoadjuvant crizotinib therapy for locally advanced IMT of the bladderare available.PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a 17-year-old Japanese boy referred to our institution for painful urination and increased urinary frequency. He wasdiagnosed with ALK-positive IMT via transurethral resection of the bladder tumor.Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5-cm mass and extramural invasion at thebladder dome. The diagnosis was locally advanced IMT of the bladder. We decidedthat partial cystectomy can be performed if neoadjuvant crizotinib therapyreduced the tumor size. After 2 months of administration, CT showed that thelongest tumor diameter was reduced by 48%. Thus, we performed partial cystectomy,and the surgical margin was negative. No recurrence developed for over 1 year.DISCUSSION: IMT has intermediate malignant potential because its clinical course is relatively indolent with low risk of distant metastasis. As this patient isyoung and IMT of the bladder has good prognosis after surgical resection,bladder-preserving surgery is the most preferred approach.CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant crizotinib therapy may be effective for large, locallyadvanced, and difficult to resect tumors.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
