They areusually detected incidentally, and the leading causes are tumors, thrombi, orinfective vegetations. However, normal structures and artifacts ("pseudomasses") should also be considered in differential diagnosis, especially after cardiacand/or aortic surgery. We present a case of an unusual left atrial image observedon transthoracic echocardiography in an 83-year-old woman after an interventionof open-chest ascending aorta replacement and myocardial revascularization.DOI: 10.4103/jcecho.jcecho_61_17 PMCID: PMC5875137PMID: 29629261
