Thisopen-label, multicenter phase II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eribulin as a first- or second-line treatment for patients withmetastatic breast cancer.METHODS: The primary objective was to determine the overall response rate.Secondary objectives were to evaluate progression-free survival and the safetyprofile. Patients were scheduled to receive eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m2intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Patients received the studytreatment unless disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a request todiscontinue from the patient and/or investigator eventuated.RESULTS: Between December 2012 and September 2015, 32 patients with metastaticbreast cancer were enrolled at 10 participating clinical institutions in Japan,and toxicity and response rates were evaluated. The overall response rate was43.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26.5-61.0). The clinical benefit and tumorcontrol rates were 56.3% (95% CI 39.0-73.5) and 78.1% (95% CI 63.8-92.5),respectively. Median progression-free survival was 8.3 months (95% CI 7.1-9.4). Asubgroup analysis did not identify any factors affecting the efficacy oferibulin. The most common adverse events were neutropenia (71.9%), alopecia(68.7%), and peripheral neuropathy (46.9%). As a first- or second-line therapy,eribulin showed sufficient efficacy for metastatic breast cancer compared withtaxane and capecitabine treatment in previous clinical trials. The safety profileof eribulin was acceptable.CONCLUSIONS: Eribulin may be another option for first-line chemotherapeuticregimens for metastatic breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATIONS: This trial was retrospectively registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trial Registry (ID number:UMIN000010334 ).
