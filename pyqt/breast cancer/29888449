Following a hit-to-lead optimization exploiting 2D and 3D cultures of MCF-7 human breast, 4T1 mammarygland, and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cancer cell lines, a 67-memberedlibrary was constructed and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) wasdetermined. Seven synthesized analogues exhibited sub-micromolar activities, fromwhich compound 63 exerted the most significant potency with a remarkable HL-60sensitivity (IC50  = 0.183 μM).© 2018 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft.DOI: 10.1002/ardp.201800062 PMID: 29888449
