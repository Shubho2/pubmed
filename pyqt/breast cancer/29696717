However, a great understanding offeatures of TNBC particularly associated with BRCA mutations has led to thedevelopment of different therapeutic approaches. Besides, identification of TNBC subtypes contribute to investigation of the underlying molecular differences and development of new strategies for the treatment of TNBC patients. In this review,we discussed the definition and characteristic properties of TNBC. We summarized an up-to-date description of the reported clinical trials of novel targetedstrategies especially PARP inhibitors (PARPi) due to novel and highly potent for the treatment of TNBC. Additionally, we reviewed published studies whichinvestigated the prevalence and types of BRCA1/2 mutation in breast cancerpatients to assess and draw attention of association of BRCA status with TNBC.Consequently, the definition subtype of TNBC has important predictive value forthe development of new therapeutic agents in the treatment of TNBC. Additionally,the incidence and types of mutations in BRCA-related pathways may be affected by ethnic origin and contribute to the risk of developing TNBC.Â© 2018 APMIS.
