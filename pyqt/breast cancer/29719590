Estrogen, epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (ERBB2, HER2), and oxidative stress represent criticalmechanistic nodes associated with BC. RLIP76 is a major mercapturic acid pathway transporter whose expression is increased in BC. In the quest of a novel moleculewith chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential, we evaluated the effects of 2'-Hydroxyflavanone (2HF) in BC. 2HF enhanced the inhibitory effects of RLIP76depletion and also inhibited RLIP76-mediated doxorubicin transport in BC cells.RNA-sequencing revealed that 2HF induces strong reversal of the gene expressionpattern in ER+MCF7, HER2+ SKBR3 and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 BC cells withminimal effects on MCF10A normal breast epithelial cells. 2HF down regulated ERα and enhanced inhibitory effects of imatinib mesylate/Gleevec in MCF7 cells. 2HFalso down regulated ERα and HER2 gene networks in MCF7 and SKBR3 cells,respectively. 2HF activated TP53 and inhibited TGFβ1 canonical pathway in MCF7and MDA-MB-231 BC cells. 2HF also regulated the expression of a number ofcritical prognostic genes of MammaPrint panel and their upstream targetsincluding TP53, CDKN2A and MYC. The collective findings from this study provide acomprehensive, direct and integrated evidence for the benefits of 2HF intargeting major and clinically relevant mechanistic regulators of BC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24720 PMCID: PMC5915057PMID: 29719590
