Methods The association between clinicopathological features and non-SLNmetastasis was retrospectively analyzed in 472 patients who underwent axillarylymph node dissection (ALND) following SLN biopsy. Another 251 patients whounderwent only SLN biopsy without ALND were analyzed and followed up for 2 years.Results A large tumor size, positive SLN, and HER-2 positivity were independentpredictors of non-SLN metastasis. There were significant differences in non-SLNmetastasis between patients with one negative SLN and patients with an absence ofnegative SLNs. There was no significant difference in non-SLN metastasis between patients with one negative SLN and two or more negative SLNs. The recurrence-freesurvival rate for patients who did not undergo ALND was 99.6% (245/246).Conclusion Surgeons should ensure that the number of SLNs obtained isappropriate. The presence of one negative SLN is enough in SLN biopsy.Considering the invasiveness of the surgery, two or more negative SLNs may beunnecessary.DOI: 10.1177/0300060517729589 PMCID: PMC5971514PMID: 29441833
