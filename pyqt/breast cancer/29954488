The cisplatin release ofG5-GA-cisplatin was evaluated at pH 5.5 and pH 7.4. The cytotoxicity ofG5-GA-cisplatin and free cisplatin was compared in cisplatin-resistant breastcancer cell line MCF-7R. The intracellular platinum content of MCF-7R wasdetermined using ICP-MS. The expression of Ctr1 and ATP7B of MCF-7R cells wasalso evaluated.RESULTS: An average of 75 amino groups present in the G5 PAMAM surface wereconverted into glutaric acid (G5-GA75) and platinum loading was 350±21 μg per 1mg of G5-GA75. G5-Ac75-cisplatin complex exhibited controlled release ofcisplatin at different pH over a period of 96 h. After 96 h incubation withG5-Ac75-cisplatin, cell viability was 27.47±2.53%, 12.18±0.65% and 11.62±0.84%using platinum concentration of 1 μg/ml, 3 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml, respectively.Meanwhile, 46.33±5.06% cells survived even in the high platinum concentration of 5 μg/ml after 96 h incubation with free cisplatin. G5-GA75 led to 3-6 timeshigher cisplatin accumulation than free cisplatin in MCF-7R cells, because MCF-7Rcells exhibited lower Ctr1 expression and higher ATP7B expression than MCF-7cells.CONCLUSION: The G5-GA75-cisplatin complex displayed greater anticancer activitythan free cisplatin in the cisplatin-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF-7R.The low levels of Ctr1 and high levels of ATP7B in MCF-7R caused G5-GA75 to allowthe accumulation of cisplatin, which in turn increased the cytotoxicity. Results indicated that glutaryl G5 PAMAM may be a potential carrier for cisplatintargeting in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1166/jnn.2018.15502 PMID: 29954488
