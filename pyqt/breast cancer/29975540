[Epub ahead ofprint]Endocytic Selective Toxicity of Rhodamine 6G nanoGUMBOS in Breast Cancer Cells.Bhattarai N(1), Mathis JM(2), Chen M(1), PÃ©rez RL(1), Siraj N(1), Magut PKS(1),McDonough K(3), Sahasrabudhe G(1), Warner IM(1).Author information: (1)Department of Chemistry , Louisiana State University , Baton Rouge , Louisiana70803 , United States.(2)Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine ,Louisiana State University , Baton Rouge , Louisiana 70803 , United States.(3)AgCenter Biotechnology Laboratories , Louisiana State University , Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803 , United States.Herein, we report on the role of endocytosis in the selective chemotherpeutictoxicity of rhodamine 6G (R6G) based nanomaterials, i.e., nanoGUMBOS, that arederived from a group of uniform materials based on organic salts (GUMBOS).Evaluation of cellular uptake in the presence and absence of endocytosisinhibitors suggests nanoGUMBOS internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in cancer cells and reveals lack of endocytic internalization in normal cells.Results from characterization of these nanomaterials suggest that endocyticinternalization in cancer cells leads to nanoGUMBOS dissociation within theendosomal environment. This ultimately results in selective cytotoxicity of thenanoGUMBOS for cancer cells with no toxicity toward normal cells under examinedconditions. Following examination of the selectivity mechanism, in vivoinvestigations were performed to examine potential therapeutic properties ofthese nanoparticles. Remarkably, nanoGUMBOS treatment using a mouse xenograftmodel reduced the tumor volume by 50% suggesting retention of in vitrotherapeutic properties in vivo. These results corroborate the selective behavior of nanoGUMBOS and demonstrate their in vivo therapeutic effects, providingfurther insight into the possible use of these nanomaterials as potentialchemotherapeutic agents.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00339 PMID: 29975540
