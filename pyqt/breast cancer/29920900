A cross-sectionalsurvey was conducted with a convenience sample of 494 Chinese women who completedthe modified Breast Cancer Screening Beliefs Questionnaire (BCSBQ). Two-samplet-tests and multivariable logistic regression were employed to analyze the data. The results indicated that participation in screening practices ranged from 27.5%for breast self-examination (BSE), 36.4% for clinical breast examination, 23.5%for mammography, and 40% for ultrasonography. Women who had previously engaged inone of the four screening practices had significantly higher scores on the three subscales of the modified BCSBQ. Being older and having a friend who had beendiagnosed with breast cancer were shown to be predictors for BSE andparticipation in either mammography or ultrasonography, respectively. Educationlevels were also shown to be positively associated with the four screeningmeasures. We suggest that cultural beliefs about breast cancer and screeningpractices play a significant role in Chinese women's screening behavior.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/nhs.12533 PMID: 29920900
