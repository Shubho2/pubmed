Materials and Methods In this retrospective, single-institution study between October 2003 and September2015, 548 consecutive women, consisting of 468 down-staged and 80 preplanned BCS patients (mean age, 45.7 years; range, 22-75 years), underwent preoperative MRIand BCS following NAC. The rate and site of LRR, preoperative MRI featuresincluding Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon, andclinical-pathologic features (age, stage, tumor subtype, histologic grade,lymphovascular invasion, adjuvant chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy) wereanalyzed with the Cox proportional hazards model to identify independent factors associated with LRR-free survival (LRFS). Results Of the 548 women, 23 (4.2%) hadLRR at a median follow-up of 23.1 months. In Cox regression analysis, younger age(ie, ≤ 40 years) (hazard ratio = 2.932; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.233,6.969; P = .015) or the presence of nonmass enhancement on preoperative MR images(hazard ratio = 3.220; 95% CI: 1.274, 8.140; P = .014) was associated with worse LRFS. LRR was more frequently observed in the same quadrant as the original tumorin the down-staged BCS group than in the preplanned BCS group (80.0% [16 of 20]vs 33.3% [one of three]; P = .021). Conclusion Age of 40 years or younger or the presence of nonmass enhancement on preoperative MR images tends to be associated with worse local-regional recurrence-free survival, and local-regional recurrencefrequently occurs in the same quadrant as the original tumor in breast cancerpatients who undergo breast-conserving surgery following neoadjuvantchemotherapy.© RSNA, 2018.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018172888 PMID: 30040058
