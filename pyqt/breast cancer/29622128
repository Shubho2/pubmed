Electronic address:lumarie.santiago@mdanderson.org.(2)Department of Radiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 1350, Houston, TX 77030, USA.MR imaging is now routinely performed for breast cancer screening and staging.For suspicious MR imaging-detected lesions that are mammographically andsonographically occult, MR imaging-guided breast interventions, including biopsy,clip placement, and preoperative needle localization, have been developed topermit accurate tissue diagnosis and aid in surgical planning. These proceduresare safe, accurate, and effective when performed according to key principles,including proper patient selection, use of appropriate technique, adequatepreprocedure preparation and postprocedure patient care, and postprocedureimaging-pathology correlation. Imaging-pathology correlation after MRimaging-guided biopsy is essential to confirm accurate sampling and guidedevelopment of a comprehensive management plan.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.
