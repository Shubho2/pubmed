According tothe global data provided by the WHO, there were more than 1.7 million new casesof breast cancer in 2012, accounting for 25% of all reported cancer cases and 15%of all reported deaths among females. To most young patients, especially thoseyounger than 40 years of age, chemotherapy should be taken into consideration as a treatment modality, even if the tumor size is small or without lymphaticmetastasis. A significant portion of the patients will suffer from the sideeffects that result from long-term chemotherapy regimens, such asmyelosuppression, heart failure, and development of a second primary malignancy. Ovarian suppression and premature ovarian failure (POF) are the most common side effects reported as they have notable clinical symptoms; the incidence rates havebeen reported to be in a range of 10-90%. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists(GnRH-a), also termed luteinizing hormone release hormone agonists (LHRH-a), may very well offer a solution to treating these side effects. This article aims tosummarize advanced studies concerning protective effects of GnRH-a on ovarianfunctions in the setting of breast cancer under chemotherapy.PMID: 29466689
