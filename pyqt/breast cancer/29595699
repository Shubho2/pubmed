Therefore, saphenous veingrafts were performed to the left anterior descending, distal left circumflex,obtuse marginal and distal right coronary arteries. The patient made asatisfactory in-hospital recovery, and was subsequently discharged back to herlocal hospital for rehabilitation.LESSONS: Patients successfully treated with mediastinal radiotherapy requirecareful long-term follow-up for the assessment of radiation-induced coronaryartery disease. Importantly, mediastinal irradiation may preclude internalmammary artery utilization, and thus alter the strategy for surgical myocardialrevascularization.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000009867 PMCID: PMC5895407PMID: 29595699  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
