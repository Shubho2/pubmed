We present a 44-year-old woman withmetastatic breast cancer presenting with a new 2-cm pericardial effusion onultrasound. In light of the patient's palliative condition and the urgent needfor chemotherapy, careful consideration was made for her surgical drainage of thepericardial effusion. Because of the patient's medical comorbidities, a generalanesthetic was deemed not to be in the patient's best interest. Furthermore, the invasive subxiphoid or thoracotomy approach for a pericardial window would haverisked delaying her much needed chemotherapy. A single-port thoracoscopicpericardial window was performed under light sedation, ventilating spontaneously on supplementary oxygen through nasal cannula only. The patient was positioned ina supine position, and a single 8-mm port was inserted into the left hemithoraxat the 5th intercostal space, midaxillary line under local anesthetic, and apericardial window made. This minimally invasive approach, without the need forintubation or ventilation, allowed for rapid relief of symptoms and discharge forthe patient to begin her chemotherapy in a timely manner. By undergoing theprocedure awake and through a single port, the patient was discharged after ashort inpatient stay. This novel approach can be advocated for patients where ageneral anesthetic or invasive surgical procedure is not suitable in thetreatment of their pericardial effusion.DOI: 10.1097/IMI.0000000000000456 PMID: 29432361
