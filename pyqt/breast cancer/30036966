Among OCPs, particular attention was focused on theeffects of β-hexaclorocyclohexane (β-HCH), a widely common pollutant. A detailed epidemiological study carried out on exposed population in the "Valle del Sacco" found correlations between the incidence of a wide range of diseases and theoccurrence of β-HCH contamination. Taking into account the pleiotropic role ofthe protein signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), itsfunction as a hub protein in cellular signaling pathways triggered by β-HCH wasinvestigated in different cell lines corresponding to tissues that are especiallyvulnerable to damage by environmental pollutants.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human prostate cancer (LNCaP), human breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDA-MB 468), and human hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines were treated with 10 μMβ-HCH in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors for different receptors. All samples were subjected to analysis by immunoblotting and RT-qPCR.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results allow us to hypothesize theinvolvement of STAT3, through both its canonical and non-canonical pathways, inresponse to β-HCH. Moreover, we ascertained the role of STAT3 as a masterregulator of energy metabolism via the altered expression and localization ofHIF-1α and PKM2, respectively, resulting in a Warburg-like effect.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19072108 PMID: 30036966
