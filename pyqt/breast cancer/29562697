Also, new fusedpyrimido[4″,5″:5',6'][1,2,4]triazino-[3',4':3,4][1,2,4]triazino[5,6-b]indolederivative 6 was prepared and used to obtain polycyclic heterocyclic systems.Confirmation of the synthesized compounds' structures was carried out usingelemental analyses and spectral data (IR, ¹H-NMR and 13C-NMR and mass spectra).The anticancer activity of some of the synthesized compounds was tested againstHepG2, HCT-116 and MCF-7 cell lines. The anticancer screening results showed thatsome derivatives display good activity which was more potent than that of thereference drug used. Molecular docking was used to predict the binding betweensome of the synthesized compounds and the prostate cancer 2q7k hormone and breast‎cancer 3hb5 receptors.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23030693 PMID: 29562697
