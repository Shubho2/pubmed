Thestained slides were independently evaluated by 8 pathologists. Dual in situhybridization assay was performed in cases of discordant results for HER2protein. Based on the results, we propose a method for receptor scoring in the CBmethod.RESULTS: Of 61 specimens, 57 contained tumor cells. Two or more pathologistsdisagreed on the results for the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, andHER2 protein in 3 (5.3%), 13 (22.8%), and 19 (33.3%) cases, respectively. Thediscrepant results for the HRs were attributed to the presence of a few positive cells or faintly stained cells. The high interobserver discordance rate for HER2 protein was explained by interobserver differences in the scoring criteria.CONCLUSION: The use of categorical scoring into positive and negative isrecommended for evaluating the HR expressions. Use of strict criteria for HER2protein 2+ and 3+ cases is recommended, as HER2-positive cases should not bemissed.Â© 2018 The Author(s) Published by S.
