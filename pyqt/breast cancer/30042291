To promote breast cancer screeningbehavior in Korean American immigrant women, a mobile phone multimedia messaging intervention (mMammogram) was developed.OBJECTIVE: The current study explores the impact of mMammogram on changes tostudy participants' screening behavior and proposes suggestions for how theintervention can be improved for wide dissemination and implementation in theKorean American community.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected through qualitative research methods.Three focus groups were conducted with 14 Korean immigrant women who completedthe mMammogram.FINDINGS: Three themes emerged: (1) better understanding of breast cancer andscreening through mMammogram (e.g., increased knowledge on breast cancer andscreening methods, increased understanding of the importance of regularmammography, and reduced anxiety about mammography); (2) health navigators as atrigger to promote mammography (e.g., providing resources for free or low-costmammograms and scheduling mammogram appointments); and (3) suggestions formMammogram (e.g., technical issues and program period).CONCLUSIONS: Mobile app intervention that is culturally tailored, along withhealth navigation services, can be a feasible, effective, and acceptable tool to promote breast cancer screening behaviors in underserved immigrant women. Amobile app can cover a broad range of breast cancer health topics and the health navigator can further help women overcome barriers to screening. A healthnavigation service is critical in overcoming language, transportation, and healthaccessibility barriers and triggering a positive change in their health screeningbehavior, especially for newly arrived immigrant populations.DOI: 10.3390/jcm7080181 PMID: 30042291
