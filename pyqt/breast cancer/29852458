Electronic address: jjacks8@tulane.edu.p53 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of genes involved in cellcycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. TP53 harbors mutations that inactivateits transcriptional activity in roughly 30% of breast cancers, and these tumorsare much more likely to undergo a pathological complete response to chemotherapy.Thus, the gene expression program activated by wild-type p53 contributes to apoor response. We used an in vivo genetic model system to comprehensively define the p53- and p21-dependent genes and pathways modulated in tumors followingdoxorubicin treatment. We identified genes differentially expressed inspontaneous mammary tumors harvested from treated MMTV-Wnt1 mice that respondpoorly (Trp53+/+) or favorably (Trp53-null) and those that lack the criticalsenescence/arrest p53 target gene Cdkn1a. Trp53 wild-type tumors differentiallyexpressed nearly 10-fold more genes than Trp53-null tumors after treatment.Pathway analyses showed that genes involved in cell cycle, senescence, andinflammation were enriched in treated Trp53 wild-type tumors; however, nogenes/pathways were identified that adequately explain the superior celldeath/tumor regression observed in Trp53-null tumors. Cdkn1a-null tumors thatretained arrest capacity (responded poorly) and those that proliferated(responded well) after treatment had remarkably different gene regulation. Forinstance, Cdkn1a-null tumors that arrested upregulated Cdkn2a (p16), suggestingan alternative, p21-independent route to arrest. Live animal imaging oflongitudinal gene expression of a senescence/inflammation gene reporter inTrp53+/+ tumors showed induction during and after chemotherapy treatment, whiletumors were arrested, but expression rapidly diminished immediately upon relapse.Copyright Â© 2018 BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE.
