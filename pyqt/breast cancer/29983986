Useof dual-drug therapies, including drug conjugates, may help overcome some ofthese roadblocks by more selective targeting of the cancer cell and by acting at multiple drug targets rather than one. Drug-conjugate approaches include linking drugs to antibodies (antibody-drug conjugates), radionuclides(radioimmunoconjugates), nanoparticles (nanoparticle-drug conjugates), or toother drugs (drug-drug conjugates). Although all of these conjugates might bedesigned as effective treatments against breast cancer, the focus of this review will be on drug-drug conjugates because of the increase in versatility of thesetypes of drugs with respect to mode of action at the level of the cancer celleither by creating a novel pharmacophore or by increasing the potency and/orefficacy of the drugs' effects at their respective molecular targets. Thedevelopment, synthesis, and pharmacological characteristics of drug-drugconjugates will be discussed in the context of breast cancer with the hope ofenhancing drug efficacy and reducing toxicities to improve patient quality oflife.DOI: 10.1002/prp2.417 PMCID: PMC6032357PMID: 29983986
