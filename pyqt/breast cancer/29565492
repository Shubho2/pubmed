Several microRNAs have been proved to participate inthe resistant process; however, the role of miR-574 in doxorubicin (Dox)resistant breast cancer is still unclear.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative Real-time poly chain reaction (qRT-PCR) wasemployed to detect the expression level of miR-574 in breast cancer Dox-resistantMCF-7/Adr cell line and parental MCF-7 cell line. Using miR-574 mimics andinhibitors, miR-574 level was up- or down- regulated.3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay washandled to detect the IC50, and flow cytometric analysis was employed to measure the apoptosis and cell circle. Dual-luciferase and Western-blot experiments were applied to verify the direct target gene of miR-574.RESULTS: miR-574 expression level was significantly higher in MCF-7/Adr cellscompared to normal MCF-7 cells. Up-regulation of miR-574 level in MCF-7 cellspromoted the cell growth and G0/G1-to-S phase transition but inhibited cellapoptosis. However, knockdown of miR-574 in MCF-7/Adr cells decreased the IC50and cell growth. Using luciferase assay, SMAD4 was confirmed to be a potentialtarget of miR-574, and the expression of SMAD4 protein was regulated by miR-574. In blood samples of patients, the miR-574 level before chemotherapy was higherthan that after chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: We revealed miR-574 could promote doxorubicin resistance of breastcancer MCF-7 cells via down-regulating SMAD4, thus providing a novel target foradvancing breast cancer chemotherapy.PMID: 29565492
