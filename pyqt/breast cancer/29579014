Spain.Epidemiologic studies suggest that patients with breast cancer who gain weightafter diagnosis have a higher risk of recurrence and death. Regular physicalexercise can help minimize post-diagnosis weight gain. The objective of the studywas to assess the effectiveness of a physical test for individualizing theworkloads used during a fitness program.To continuously individualize theintensity of the training, a test was designed and integrated into the sessions. The test consisted in monitoring heart rate and workload during two bouts ofcycling at moderate intensity. The workload parameters recorded during the tests were later used as reference values to plan the intensity of the next inpersontraining sessions.The five tests carried out during the twelve weeks of theintervention showed significant differences in intensity (F=3.034, p=0.047).Compared to the first evaluation, the intensities measured during the third,fourth and fifth tests presented increases of 9.9% (p=0.02), 13.2% (p=0.019) and 17.5% (p=0.002) respectively. A significant increase in workload with respect to body weight was observed in the physical assessment performed after the program(t= 13.2, p=0.0001). The peak oxygen consumption with respect to body weight(peak VO2) achieved by the participants during the assessment at the end of theprogram had also increased (t= 9.72, P= 0.0001).The intensity test, introduced inthe training sessions along with the physical exercise program, was aneasy-to-use, practical tool for monitoring intensity. It allows an adjustment of the workload over the program period that respects the individual progression of each patient.DOI: 10.1519/JSC.0000000000002337 PMID: 29579014
