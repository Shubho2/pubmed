[Epub aheadof print]Intracellular sequestration of HER2 via targeted subcellular peptide delivery.Walls ZF(1)(2), Schwengels M(3), Palau V(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gatton College of Pharmacy , EastTennessee State University , Johnson City , TN , USA.(2)c Center of Excellence for Inflammation, Infectious Disease and Immunity, EastTennessee State University , Johnson City , TN , USA.(3)b Phoebe Putney Health System , Albany , GA , USA.The use of peptides in drug development has been hampered by their poorpharmaceutical properties, most notably their inability to reliably permeatebiological membranes and lack of targeting. To overcome these disadvantages, the AMino acid Intracellular Delivery SysTem (AMIDST) was developed. This modularpeptide-based delivery system confers cellular permeability andorganelle-specific targeting for therapeutic peptides. As demonstrated in thisstudy, the delivery of a HER2-binding peptide to the secretory organelles ofbreast cancer cells resulted in intracellular sequestration, a reduction indownstream signalling, and reduced viability compared to the delivery of acontrol peptide. Given its modular design and ease of production, AMIDST has the potential to enhance the use of peptides as therapeutic agents.DOI: 10.1080/1061186X.2018.1450411 PMID: 29521129
