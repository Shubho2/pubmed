Indications forneodjuvant therapy administration have been expanded over the years, and nowadaysthis kind of treatment represents an inevitable option in early breast cancertreatment. The NeoPULSE project, which gathered a group of experts in the fieldof breast cancer from five Serbian university centres, was formed with the aim todefine optimal breast cancer diagnosis, indications for neoadjuvant therapy,therapeutic combinations in relation to molecular/biological parameters of breastcancer, as well as the treatment after neoadjuvant therapy. During two separateexpert meetings involving surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, apathologist, and a "Blueprint" workshop, the project participants answeredquestions over the indications for neoadjuvant therapy. The first part coveredlocal practice and referred to the existence and work of a multidisciplinaryteam, as well as commonly applied therapeutic regimens in the neoadjuvantsetting. Experts analysed personal views regarding indications for theadministration and benefits of neoadjuvant therapy, their perception on thecorrelation between achieving a pathological complete response (pCR) and theoutcome of treatment, as well as the attitude towards controversies about thistype of treatment, primarily regarding a possible change in the receptor statusafter therapy and therapeutic options after a suboptimal response. The analysisof the answers pointed to problems and deviations from recommendations ineveryday clinical practice, based on which appropriate solutions were proposed.The establishment of such a panel and consensus is an attempt to modernizemultidisciplinary teams in Serbia, achieve reaching uniform decisions of allsubjects dealing with breast cancer, and therefore, at least in one segment,improve breast cancer treatment in Serbia.PMID: 29745102
