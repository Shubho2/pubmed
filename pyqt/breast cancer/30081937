Given the same disease burden, some patients master the situation well, while others experience a great deal of stress, depression and lowered quality of life. Patients with highpsychological resilience are likely to experience fewer stress reactions andbetter adapt to and manage the life threat and the demanding treatment thatfollows the diagnosis. If this phenomenon of mastering difficult situations isreflected also in biomolecular processes is not much studied, nor has itscapacity for impacting the cancer prognosis been addressed. This projectspecifically aims, for the first time, to investigate how a breast cancerpatient's psychological resilience is coupled to biomolecular parameters usingadvanced "omics" and, as a secondary aim, whether it relates to prognosis andquality of life one year after diagnosis.METHOD: The study population consists of newly diagnosed breast cancer patientsenrolled in the Sweden Cancerome Analysis Network - Breast (SCAN-B) at fourhospitals in Sweden. At the time of cancer diagnosis, the patient fills out thestandardized method to measure psychological resilience, the "Connor-DavidsonResilience scale" (CD-RISC), the quality of life measure SF-36, as well asproviding social and socioeconomic variables. In addition, one blood sample iscollected. At the one-year follow-up, the patient will be subjected to the sameassessments, and we also collect information regarding smoking, exercise habits, and BMI, as well as patients' trust in the treatment and their satisfaction with the care and treatment.DISCUSSION: This explorative hypothesis-generating project will pave the way for larger validation studies, potentially leading to a standardized method ofmeasuring psychological resilience as an important parameter in cancer care.Revealing the body-mind interaction, in terms of psychological resilience andquality of life, will herald the development of truly personalized psychosocialcare and cancer intervention treatment strategies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This is a retrospectively registered trial atClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03430492 on February 6, 2018.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4669-y PMID: 30081937
