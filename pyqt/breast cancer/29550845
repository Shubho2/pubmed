Wecalculated the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at 85min (SUV1), SUVmaxat 125min (SUV2) and the retention index [RI]. Spearman's rank correlation test, the Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis wereperformed to assess the association between 18F-FDG uptake and theclinicopathological and immunohistochemical factors: glucose transporter-1(Glut-1), estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), ERβ, progesterone receptor (PR), humanepidermal growth factor 2 (Her2), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), andP70S6kinase (P70S6).RESULTS: The SUV1 and SUV2 values were correlated with Glut-1, pathological tumorsize, ERα negativity, and pathological stage (all P values were <0.05), but notwith mTOR, P70S6, ERβ, PR, Her2 or other factors. The SUV1 and SUV2 in the triplenegative subtype were significantly higher than those of the hormonereceptor-positive subtype (P<0.05). The RI was associated with pathological tumorsize alone. In the ROC analysis of Glut-1, the areas under the curve for SUV1 andSUV2 were significantly larger than that for RI (SUV1, P=0.032, SUV2, P=0.022).CONCLUSION: Glucose transporter-1, estrogen receptor alpha negativity and nucleargrade might affect the high 18F-FDG uptake in breast cancer. The SUVmax might be more useful than the RI for predicting the Glut-1 expression and theaggressiveness of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1967/s002449910705 PMID: 29550845  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
