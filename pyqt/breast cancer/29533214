Despite thevaluable findings of curcumin against different cancer cells, the clinical use ofcurcumin in cancer treatment is limited due to its extremely low aqueoussolubility and instability, which lead to poor in vivo bioavailability andlimited therapeutic effects. We therefore focused in the present study toevaluate the anti-tumor potential of curcumin analogues on the human breastcarcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, as well as their effects onnon-tumorigenic normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10). The IC50 values ofcurcumin analogue J1 in these cancer cell lines were determined to be 5 ng/ml and10 ng/ml, in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells respectively. Interestingly, at theseconcentrations, the J1 did not affect the viability of non-tumorigenic normalbreast epithelial cells MCF-10. Furthermore, we found that J1 strongly inducedgrowth arrest of these cancer cells by modulating the mitochondrial membranepotentials without significant effect on normal MCF-10 cells using JC-1 staining and flow cytometry analysis. Using annexin-V/PI double staining assay followed byflow cytometry analysis, we found that J1 robustly enhanced the induction ofapoptosis by increasing the activity of caspases in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cancercells. In addition, treatment of breast cancer cells with J1 revealed that, incontrast to the expression of cyclin B1, this curcumin analogue vigorouslydecreased the expression of cyclin A, CDK2 and cyclin E and subsequentlysensitized tumor cells to cell cycle arrest. Most importantly, thephosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and PKC-theta in J1-treated cancer cells wasmarkedly decreased and hence affecting the survival of these cancer cells. Mostinterestingly, J1-treated cancer cells exhibited a significant inhibition in the activation of RhoA followed by reduction in actin polymerization and cytoskeletalrearrangement in response to CXCL12. Our data reveal the therapeutic potential ofthe curcumin analogue J1 and the underlying mechanisms to fight breast cancercells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
