Email: hashemim@zaums.ac.irIt has been shown that a 4-bp insertion/deletion (ins/del) polymorphism of EGLN2 influences the risk of several cancers. However, to date, no study has inspected the impact of the 4-bp ins/del polymorphism on breast cancer (BC) risk. Acase-control study, including 134 breast cancer patients and 154 healthy women,was here conducted to examine the possible association between EGLN2 4-bp ins/delpolymorphism and BC risk in a southeast Iranian population. A mismatchedpolymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) wasdesigned for genotyping of the variant. Our findings did not support anyassociation between the 4-bp ins/del polymorphism and the risk of BC in thecodominant, dominant, recessive and allele inheritance models tested. When links between the EGLN2 4-bp ins/del polymorphism and clinicopathologicalcharacteristics of the patients were evaluate the variant was only associatedwith HER2 status. More studies with larger sample sizes and diverse ethnicitiesare warranted to verify our finding.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.923 PMCID: PMC6031807PMID: 29693343
