Epub 2018Mar 21.Prediction of Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Korea, 2018.Jung KW(1)(2), Won YJ(1)(2)(3), Kong HJ(1)(2), Lee ES(1)(4).Author information: (1)The Korea Central Cancer Registry, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.(2)National Cancer Control Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.(3)Department of Cancer Control and Population Health, National Cancer CenterGraduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, Goyang,Korea.(4)National Cancer Center Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.PURPOSE: This study aimed to report on cancer incidence and mortality for theyear 2018 to estimate Korea's current cancer burden.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer incidence data from 1999 to 2015 were obtained fromthe Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, and cancer mortality data from 1993to 2016 were acquired from Statistics Korea. Cancer incidence and mortality were projected by fitting a linear regression model to observed age-specific cancerrates against observed years, then multiplying the projected age-specific ratesby the age-specific population. The Joinpoint regression model was used todetermine at which year the linear trend changed significantly, we only used the data of the latest trend.RESULTS: A total of 204,909 new cancer cases and 82,155 cancer deaths areexpected to occur in Korea in 2018. The most common cancer sites were lung,followed by stomach, colorectal, breast and liver. These five cancers representhalf of the overall burden of cancer in Korea. For mortality, the most commonsites were lung cancer, followed by liver, colorectal, stomach and pancreas.CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of all cancer in Korea are estimated to decreasegradually, mainly due to decrease of thyroid cancer. These up-to-date estimatesof the cancer burden in Korea could be an important resource for planning andevaluation of cancer-control programs.DOI: 10.4143/crt.2018.142 PMCID: PMC5912149PMID: 29566480
