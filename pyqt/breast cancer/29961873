We utilized genome-wide molecular profiling to identify therapeutic targets acquired in metastatic disease.Methods: Gene expression profiling of 21 patient-matched primary breast tumorsand their associated brain metastases was performed by TrueSeq RNA-sequencing to determine clinically actionable BrM target genes. Identified targets werefunctionally validated using small molecule inhibitors in a cohort of resectedBrM ex vivo explants (n = 4) and in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model ofBrM. All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: Considerable shifts in breast cancer cell-specific gene expressionprofiles were observed (1314 genes upregulated in BrM; 1702 genes downregulatedin BrM; DESeq; fold change > 1.5, Padj < .05). Subsequent bioinformatic analysis for readily druggable targets revealed recurrent gains in RET expression andhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) signaling. Small moleculeinhibition of RET and HER2 in ex vivo patient BrM models (n = 4) resulted instatistically significantly reduced proliferation (P < .001 in four of fourmodels). Furthermore, RET and HER2 inhibition in a PDX model of BrM led to astatistically significant antitumor response vs control (n = 4, % tumor growthinhibition [mean difference; SD], anti-RET = 86.3% [1176; 258.3], P < .001;anti-HER2 = 91.2% [1114; 257.9], P < .01).Conclusions: RNA-seq profiling of longitudinally collected specimens uncoveredrecurrent gene expression acquisitions in metastatic tumors, distinct frommatched primary tumors. Critically, we identify aberrations in key oncogenicpathways and provide functional evidence for their suitability as therapeutictargets. Altogether, this study establishes recurrent, acquired vulnerabilitiesin BrM that warrant immediate clinical investigation and suggests paired specimenexpression profiling as a compelling and underutilized strategy to identifytargetable dependencies in advanced cancers.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy110 PMID: 29961873
