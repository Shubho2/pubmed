For sensitive and selectivedetection, the anodic pole of the bipolar electrode was modified with the AS1411 aptamer, a specific aptamer for the nucleolin, and treated by the secondaryaptamer modified gold nanoparticles. The electrochemiluminescence of luminol was followed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide on the anode pole of bipolarelectrode (BPE) as an analytical signal. Moreover, 3D printed microchannels were used for the fabrication of BPE systems to minimize the required amounts ofsample. The present aptasensor offers low cost, sensitive and selective cancercell detection with two acceptable linear ranges. The first linear sectionappears within 10-100 cells and the latter is found to be within 100-700 cells.The limit of detection was about 10 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
