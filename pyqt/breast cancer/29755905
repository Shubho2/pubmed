The medical recordreview was relevant for mastectomy and adjuvant therapy for breast cancercomplicated by pontocerebellar angle metastasis. Eye patching and application of antibiotic and vitamin ointments were prescribed at first, without a significant improvement. Thus, treatment with autologous serum was started. In about twoweeks, the cornea recovered and visual acuity improved with a residual cornealscarring. Finally, we should mention that, in our case, the main cause of theneurotrophic corneal ulcer could be identified in the previous trigeminal damage at the pontocerebellar angle and trigeminal ganglion. Sensory nerves play animportant regulatory role via neuro-mediators on corneal wound healing, asdenervation may interfere with cellular metabolism and inhibit mitosis, leadingto an epithelial defect even with no direct damage.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2309 PMCID: PMC5947927PMID: 29755905
