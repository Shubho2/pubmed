China.Testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) is normally expressed in the testes and isoverexpressed in various types of human cancers, including breast cancer,colorectal carcinoma and laryngocarcinoma. However, little has been reported onthe association between TSP50 and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The presentstudy aimed to detect TSP50 expression in 198 strict follow-up cases of pairedNSCLC and 15 cases of normal lung parenchymal specimens using immunohistochemicalstaining. The expression levels of TSP50 were then correlated with theclinicopathological factors of NSCLC to assess its potential diagnostic andprognostic value. The relationship between TSP50 expression and theclinicopathological parameters of NSCLC was evaluated using Ï‡2 and Fisher's exacttests. Survival rates for the overall population (n=198) were calculated usingthe Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox's proportional hazards regression model. P<0.05 was considered toindicate a statistically significant difference. The expression of TSP50 wassignificantly increased in NSCLC tissue compared with in adjacent non-tumor ornormal lung parenchymal tissue (P<0.001). A significant association was revealed between high expression levels of TSP50 and clinicopathological characteristicsincluding tumor differentiation (P=0.012), late tumor status (P=0.004) and latetumor node metastasis stage (P=0.026), as well as a reduced disease free survival(P=0.009) and overall survival rate (P=0.002) in all patients with NSCLC.Multivariate analyses demonstrated that high TSP50 expression in tumor tissueswas significantly associated with a shorter disease-free survival rate [hazardratio (HR) =1.590, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.035-2.441], and with a shorteroverall survival rate (HR=1.814; 95% CI: 1.156-2.846). In conclusion, the presentdata demonstrated that increased TSP50 protein expression may be a potentialpredictor of early recurrence and poor prognosis in NSCLC, and that TSP50expression levels possess the potential to be used as a biomarker and therapeutictarget for the treatment of patients with NSCLC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8387 PMCID: PMC5950601PMID: 29805619
