A betterunderstanding of the mechanisms underlying these interactions would aid indeveloping new therapeutic approaches to inhibit this progression. Here, wedescribe the fabrication of a simple microfluidic bioreactor capable ofrecapitulating the three-dimensional breast tumor microenvironment. Cancer cellspheroids, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells co-cultured in this device create arobust microenvironment suitable for studying in real time the migration ofcancer cells along matrix structures laid down by fibroblasts within the 3D tumormicroenvironment. This system allows for ready evaluation of response to targetedtherapy.DOI: 10.1063/1.5016433 PMCID: PMC5938175 [Available on 2019-05-07]PMID: 29774083
