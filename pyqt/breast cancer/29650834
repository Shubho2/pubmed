Thepatient was a 49-year-old woman presenting with a bloody nipple discharge fromthe right breast. We suspected intraductal papilloma and performed amicrodochectomy. A pathological analysis of the resected specimen confirmed thediagnosis as neuroendocrine carcinoma. The tumor was positive for estrogenreceptor, progesterone receptor, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin, but negative for the HER2/neu marker. The Ki-67 labeling-index was 40%. As the tumor marginwas positive, breast-conserving surgery plus level II axillary lymph nodedissection was performed. After surgery, radiotherapy(total dose of 50 Gy)wasadministered for treating residual breast involvement. Adjuvant hormonal therapy was performed for 5 years. Ten years after surgery, ultrasonography revealed a12mm irregular hypoechoic mass in the left breast. The mass was diagnosed as asolid tubular carcinoma based on core needle biopsy findings. Subsequently, weperformed breast-conserving surgery. The pathological diagnosis was aneuroendocrine carcinoma, and the tumor was positive for estrogen receptor,progesterone receptor, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and CD56, but negative for the HER2/neu marker. The Ki-67 labeling-index was 50%. We report our experiences with a rare case of asynchronous bilateral neuroendocrine breast carcinoma. Inthis case, ultrasonography was a useful modality for detecting both the lesions.PMID: 29650834  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
