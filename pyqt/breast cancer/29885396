Electronicaddress: phamtrungsan@nitra.vast.vn.In the present study, three sulfated polysaccharides, two fractions offucosylated chondroitin sulfates, and one sulfated fucan were isolated from thebody wall of the Vietnamese sea cucumber Stichopus variegatus. The structure ofthe sulfated fucan fraction SvF3 from S. variegatus was investigated for thefirst time. According to NMR spectroscopy data, the sulfated fucan SvF3 contained1,2- and 1,3-linked α-l-fucopyranose residues. Sulfate groups were found at the 2and/or 4 positions. The structural analysis of fucoidan was assisted by tandemmass spectrometry; the recently-developed technique of autohydrolysis inheavy‑oxygen water for the obtaining of selectively labeled fucoidan fragmentswas applied. The labeling (+2 Da mass shift at the reducing end) allowed us toassign MS/MS data unambiguously, and thus to confirm the NMR data and revealedminor sulfation at position 3. It was shown that the sulfated fucan SvF3 was not cytotoxic to human breast cancer T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, and itinhibited colony formation of those cells in vitro. SvF3 also possessed slightactivity against migration of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.06.017 PMID: 29885396
