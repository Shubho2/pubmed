However, it is completely unclear whether other forms of cancer are also affected by AP and if residential green spaces could lower cancer incidence ratesin general. Therefore, the objective was to estimate whether AP and green spaceare associated with several cancer types.METHODS: The analysis was based on routine health care data from around 1.9million people from Saxony who were free of cancer in 2008 and 2009. Incidentcancer cases (2010-2014) of mouth and throat, skin (non-melanoma skin cancer -NMSC), prostate, breast, and colorectum were defined as: (1) one inpatientdiagnosis, or (2) two outpatient diagnoses in two different quarters within oneyear and a specific treatment or death within two quarters after the diagnosis.Exposures, derived from freely available 3rd party data, included particulatematter with aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 μm (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide(N02) as well as green space (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI).Associations between air pollutants, green space, and cancer incidence wereassessed by multilevel Poisson models. Age, sex, physician contacts, short- andlong-term unemployment, population density, and having an alcohol-relateddisorder were considered as potential confounders.RESULTS: Three thousand one hundred seven people developed mouth and throatcancer, 33,178 NMSC, 9611 prostate cancer, 9577 breast cancer, and 11,975colorectal cancer during the follow-up period (2010-2014). An increase in PM10 of10 μg/m3 was associated with a 53% increase in relative risk (RR) of mouth andthroat cancer and a 52% increase in RR of NMSC. Prostate and breast cancer weremodestly associated with PM10 with an increase in RR of 23 and 19%, respectively.The associations with N02 were in the same direction as PM10 but the effectestimates were much lower (7-24%). A 10% increase in NDVI was most protective of mouth and throat cancer (- 11% RR) and of NMSC (- 16% RR). Colorectal cancer was not affected by any of the exposures.CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the studies carried out so far, this study was ableto provide evidence that higher ambient AP levels increase the risk of mouth and throat cancer as well as of NMSC and that a higher residential green space level might have a protective effect for NMSC in areas with low to moderate UVintensity. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out residual confounding by socioeconomicor smoking status.DOI: 10.1186/s12889-018-5615-2 PMCID: PMC5994126PMID: 29884153
