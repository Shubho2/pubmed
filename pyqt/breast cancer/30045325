Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is associated with adversesurvival of BC patients. The aim of this study is to identify risk effect betweenNLR and BC in Chinese population with or without obesity and MetS. BC andage-matched breast benign disease (BBD) patients were retrospectively analyzedfrom Comprehensive Breast Health Center, Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. MetS wasdefined using AHA/NHLBI criteria. Individuals were classified into very low(0-1.30), low (1.31-1.67), intermediate (1.68-2.20), and high (>2.20) NLR subsetsby each NLR quartile. In all, 1540 BC and 1540 BBD patients were included.Univariate and multivariate analysis found that NLR (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.16-1.39,P < .001) and obesity (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.00-1.42, P = .046) but not MetS(P = .060) were significantly associated with increased BC risk. Intermediate or high NLR substantially increased BC risk compared to very low NLR group (OR:1.57, 95% CI: 1.29-1.92, P < .001; OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.50-2.25, P < .001;respectively) in whole population. Subgroup analysis found that the impact ofhigher NLR on BC risk was more obvious in patients without obesity (intermediate NLR, OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.37-2.16, P < .001; high NLR, OR: 1.92, 95% CI:1.53-2.41, P < .001) or without MetS (intermediate NLR, OR: 1.70, 95% CI:1.35-2.14, P < .001; high NLR, OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.57-2.51, P < .001). Higherpreoperative NLR was found in BC patients compared with BBD patients.Intermediate to high NLR level substantially increased BC risk, which was morerelevant for those without obesity or MetS.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011692 PMID: 30045325  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
