Tissue sections werecollected and stained using the immunohistochemical method. The samples weregrouped into human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, (HER2) overexpression,Triple negative, Luminal A and Luminal B groups. Age, tumor size, breast cancermolecular subtype, clinical stage, miR-10b positive expression, positiveexpression of Ki-67 and survival rate of patients diagnosed with BIDC wereanalyzed. The expression of miR-10b was down-regulated in the breast carcinomatissues. Age and clinical stage were distinctly different among patients withdifferent molecular subtypes of BIDC (p less than 0.05). Tumor size was notremarkably different (p less than 0.05) among different subtypes. The positiveexpression rate of miR-10b was lowest in patients with Luminal B BIDC; thepositive expression of Ki-67 was in different correlation with the expression of different receptors, and there was a remarkable difference (p less than 0.05);moreover, the survival rate of patients with Luminal A and B BIDC wassignificantly higher compared to patients with other molecular subtypes (p lessthan 0.05). Clinical characteristics and prognosis of BIDC vary among differentmolecular subtypes. This study provides valuable input on BIDC therapy.PMID: 29921380
