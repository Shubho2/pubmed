In former study, an RGD reverse sequence dGR was used todevelop active-targeting liposome R8dGR-Lip, which showed well penetratingability and treatment efficiency on glioma model. However, recurrence after tumorresection caused by post-operative residual cancer cells was a huge obstacle intumor treatment. In consideration of the effective anti-cancer effect ofPTX-R8dGR-Lip when treating glioma in former study, we decide to evaluate itspharmacodynamics on tumor resection models, which were more invasive andresistant.METHOD: In vitro, the effectiveness of PTX-R8dGR-Lip in reducing tumor initiatingcell (TIC) was investigated using mammosphere formation. In vivo, the inhibition efficiency of PTX-R8dGR-Lip on C6 glioma recurrence and 4 T1 breast cancerrecurrence model were evaluated, including tumor bioluminescence imaging,survival rate and immumohistochemical staining, etc..RESULTS: C6 mammosphere formation rate of PTX-R8dGR-Lip group was 48.06 ± 2.72%, and 4 T1 mammosphere formation rate of PTX-R8dGR-Lip group was 39.51 ± 4.02% whenPBS group was set as 100%. C6 and 4 T1 bioluminescent tumor resected model wereestablished, then effectiveness of different PTX-loaded preparations wereevaluated on these two models. PTX-R8dGR-Lip could obviously inhibit tumorrecurrence, prolong survival rate and reduce tumor tissue invasion.CONCLUSION: PTX-R8dGR-Lip could reduce post-operative recurrence rate, prolongsurvival time, and decrease the proliferation of residual cancer cells throughregulating the expression of recurrence-related cytokines.DOI: 10.1007/s11095-018-2399-0 PMID: 29700620
