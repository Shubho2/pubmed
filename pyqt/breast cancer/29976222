This study aimed to describe thelevel of patient acceptance toward various long-term treatments in real lifeusing an online patient community.METHODS: This was an observational, cross-sectional study conducted through theFrench Carenity platform. All Carenity patient members were invited to completean online questionnaire including the 25-item ACCEptance by the Patients of theirTreatment (ACCEPT©) questionnaire. ACCEPT© measures patient acceptance towardtheir medication and includes one general acceptance dimension(Acceptance/General) and six treatment-attribute specific dimensions (scores0-100; lowest to highest acceptance): Acceptance/Medication Inconvenience,Acceptance/Long-term Treatment, Acceptance/Regimen Constraints, Acceptance/Sideeffects, Acceptance/Effectiveness, and Acceptance/Numerous Medications. Patients included in the analysis were treated adults experiencing any chronic diseasesand who responded to at least one ACCEPT© item.RESULTS: Among the 4193 patients included in the analysis, more than 270 chronic diseases were represented, amidst which 19 included more than 30 patients. MeanACCEPT© Acceptance/General score for those 19 diseases were 61.2 (SD = 31.9) for type 1 diabetes, 59.8 (SD = 32.3) for asthma, 56.3 (SD = 34.3) for hypertension, 52.0 (SD = 32.2) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 51.7 (SD = 27.0) for epilepsy, 50.1 (SD = 33.1) for bipolar disorder, 49.9 (SD = 33.1) for type 2diabetes, 48.6 (SD = 31.6) for multiple sclerosis, 46.1 (SD = 34.5) for Crohn'sdisease/ulcerative colitis, 44.3 (SD = 31.5) for depression, 42.8 (SD = 31.5) forlupus, 42.3 (SD = 33.0) for arthrosis, 41.8 (SD = 32.6) for Parkinson's disease, 40.5 (SD = 32.2) for rheumatoid arthritis, 38.6 (SD = 31.7) for breast cancer,36.4 (SD = 36.4) for myocardial infarction, 35.8 (SD = 32.0) for ankylosingspondylitis, 34.1 (SD = 32.3) for psoriasis, and 33.7 (SD = 31.7) forfibromyalgia.CONCLUSIONS: This first of its kind study enabled ACCEPT© data to be collected inreal life for a variety of chronic diseases. These data may help in evaluatingand interpreting levels of acceptance in future studies and provide valuableinsights about patient priorities and current unmet needs.DOI: 10.1186/s12955-018-0962-3 PMCID: PMC6034222PMID: 29976222
