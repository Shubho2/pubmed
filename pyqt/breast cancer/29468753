Epub 2018 Feb 22.F1012-2 inhibits the growth of triple negative breast cancer through induction ofcell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy.Tian S(1), Chen Y(1), Yang B(1), Lou C(1), Zhu R(1), Zhao Y(1), Zhao H(1).Author information: (1)Institute of Pharmacology, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, ZhejiangChinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 311402, China.Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) are plant-derived constituents that have been provedto have potential antitumour activity. However, the intracellular moleculartargets of SLs and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been wellelucidated. Here, we report that F1012-2, a novel SL active fraction, isolatedfrom Eupatorium lindleyanum DC., can significantly inhibit the growth oftriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) but has noobvious inhibitory effect on the growth of human mammary epithelial cells(MCF-10A). The related mechanisms on cell growth inhibition of F1012-2 weredemonstrated by inducing apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner through theintrinsic pathway and extrinsic pathway. F1012-2 could also activate autophagy inTNBC cells. Simultaneously, we found that F1012-2-induced apoptosis was enhanced by inhibition of autophagy. Furthermore, F1012-2 could induce cell cycle arrestat G2/M phase with decreasing expression of cyclin B1, cdc2, and upregulatingp21, p-cdc2. Also, F1012-2 activated Akt and p38 signalling pathways. In vivo,F1012-2 exhibited a potential antitumour effect in MDA-MB-231 xenografts without apparent toxicity. Taken together, our results identified that F1012-2 inhibited cell growth via multiple signalling pathways in vitro and in vivo. These datasuggest that F1012-2 may be a potential natural active fraction for the treatmentof TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6030 PMID: 29468753  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
