During the staging period, renal cellcarcinoma on the left kidney and mucinous adenocarcinoma in the proximal colonwere found. Since the breast tumour demonstrated favourable biology, aromataseinhibitor therapy had been started and simultaneous right colectomy and leftnephrectomy was performed. Six months after the first diagnosis, left sectorexcision and axillary block dissection were performed. Adjuvant FEC chemotherapy was administered, followed by radiotherapy. During the 16-month follow-up period disease recurrence was not detected.DOI: 10.1093/jscr/rjy041 PMCID: PMC5890479PMID: 29657704
