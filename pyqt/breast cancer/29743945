In addition to value frameworks, such as the American Society ofClinical Oncology Value Framework and the European Society of MedicalOncology-Magnitude of Clinical benefit Scale, this also requires a transparentoverview of actual drug prices. While list prices are available, evidence ontreatment cost is not. This paper aims to synthesise evidence on thereimbursement and costs of high-cost breast cancer drugs in The Netherlands (NL).Methods: A literature review was performed to identify currently reimbursedbreast cancer drugs in the NL. Treatment costs were determined by multiplyinglist prices with the average length of treatment and dosing schedule.Results: Comparing list prices to the estimated treatment cost resulted insubstantial differences in the ranking of costliness of the drugs. The averagemean treatment length was unknown for 11/31 breast cancer drugs (26.2%). Thedifferences in the 15 highest-cost drugs were largest for Bevacizumab, Lapatinib and everolimus, with list prices of €541, €158, €1,168 and estimated treatmentcost of €174,400, €18,682 and €31,207, respectively. The lowest-cost (patented)targeted drug is €1,818 more expensive than the highest-cost (off-patent) genericdrug according to the estimated drug treatment cost.Conclusions: A lack of evidence on the reimbursement and cost of high-cost breastcancer drugs complicates rapid and transparent evidence synthesis, necessary tofocus strategies aiming to limit the increasing healthcare costs. Interestingly, the findings show that off-patent generics (such as paclitaxel or doxorubicin),although substantially cheaper than patented drugs, are still relatively costly. Extending standardisation and increasing European and national regulations onpresenting information on costs per cancer drug is highly recommended.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.825 PMCID: PMC5931813PMID: 29743945
