Epub2017 Dec 30.Current status of brachytherapy in cancer treatment - short overview.Skowronek J(1)(2).Author information: (1)Brachytherapy Department, Greater Poland Cancer Center.(2)Electroradiology Department, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan,Poland.Cancer incidence and mortality depend on a number of factors, including age,socio-economic status and geographical location, and its prevalence is growingaround the world. Most of cancer treatments include external beam radiotherapy orbrachytherapy. Brachytherapy, a type of radiotherapy with energy fromradionuclides inserted directly into the tumor, is increasingly used in cancertreatment. For cervical and skin cancers, it has become a standard therapy formore than 100 years as well as an important part of the treatment guidelines for other malignancies, including head and neck, skin, breast, and prostate cancers. Compared to external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy has the potential todeliver an ablative radiation dose over a short period of time directly to thealtered tissue area with the advantage of a rapid fall-off in dose, andconsequently, sparing of adjacent organs. As a result, the patient is able tocomplete the treatment earlier, and the risks of occurrence of another cancer arelower than in conventional radiotherapy treatment. Brachytherapy has increasedits use as a radical or palliative treatment, and become more advanced with thespread of pulsed-dose-rate and high-dose-rate afterloading machines; the use ofnew 3D/4D planning systems has additionally improved the quality of thetreatment. The aim of the present study was to present short summaries of currentstudies on brachytherapy for the most frequently diagnosed tumors. Data presentedin this manuscript should help especially young physicians or physicists toexplore and introduce brachytherapy in cancer treatments.DOI: 10.5114/jcb.2017.72607 PMCID: PMC5808003PMID: 29441104
