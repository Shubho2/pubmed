Electronic address: mwsabaa@sci.cu.edu.eg.In our study, we aimed to synthesize novel grafted hyaluronic acid with cationic biodegradable polymer, poly (N-vinyl imidazole) (PVI), through free radicalpolymerization using potassium persulfate as initiator. The effect of variousgrafting factors including initiator and monomer concentrations, reaction timeand temperature was studied on the percentage of grafting parameters such as;graft yield (% GY), grafting efficiency (% GE) and amount of homopolymerformation (% H). Maximum grafted HA was% GY = 235% and%GE = 83% obtained onoptimum conditions at [In] = 17.5 mmol L-1, [M] = 1.25 mol L-1, Temp. = 50 °C,time = 1.5 h and [HA] = 0.025 mol L-1. The structure of grafted HA (HA-g-PVI) waselucidated via various analysis tools such as; elemental analyses, FTIR, 1H NMR, XRD, TGA and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Hepatic andbreast cancers are two common cancer types threatening people worldwide, so, the antitumor activity of two grafted HA samples (% GY = 155% and 235%) was studiedagainst hepatic cancer (HepG-2) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) compared to unmodified HA and PVI. The results showed that antitumor activity of graftedsamples was more than unmodified HA and increased with increasing the graftingpercentage of PVI onto HA chains, also, the antitumor activity of tested samples against HepG-2 cell lines was higher than MCF-7 cell lines.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
