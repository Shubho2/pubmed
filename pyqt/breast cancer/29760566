Integrin subunit alpha 7 (ITGA7) is a functioning protein. It has been detectedin many malignancies. But the function of ITGA7 in breast cancer is not clear.Our aim is to explore ITGA7 expression and its role in breast cancer.Methods: Real-time PCR was performed to determine ITGA7 expression in BC tissues and normal adjacent tissues. The specific functions of ITGA7 in breast cancercell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549) transfected with small interfering RNA weredetermined through migration, invasion assays. Western blot assays were performedto determine the expression of c-met and vimentin.Results: ITGA7 was down-regulated in breast cancer tissues compared to theadjacent normal tissues (T:N =7.68±27.38: 41.01± 31.47, P<0.001) and thisobservation was consistent with the TCGA cohort (T:N =4.51±0.45:5.40±0.61,P<0.0001). In vitro experiments showed that knocking down ITGA7 significantlyinhibited the migration and invasion of the breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549). Meanwhile, knockdown of ITGA7 promoted c-met and vimentinexpression, which may induce invasion and migration.Conclusion: ITGA7 plays an important tumorigenic function and acts as a suppress gene in breast cancer. Our findings indicate that ITGA7 was the gene associatedwith breast cancer.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S160379 PMCID: PMC5937492PMID: 29760566
