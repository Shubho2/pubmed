Several factors including genetic and environmental have been linked withsusceptibility to development of BC. Her2 is a transmembrane protein withtyrosine kinase activity, overexpressed in several cancers including BC. Various studies in different populations have shown association of Her2 variants withsusceptibility to BC, however these results were inconsistent, inconclusive andcontroversial. To obtain a common conclusive finding, we performed meta-analysis of 35 case-control studies reported earlier including 19, 220 cases and 22, 306controls. We observed significant association of Her2 Ile655Val polymorphism withsusceptibility to development of breast cancer (Overall allele Val vs Ile:OR = 1.130, 95% CI = 1.051-1.216, p = 0.001; Ile-Val vs Ile-Ile: OR = 1.100, 95% CI = 1.016-1.192, p = 0.019; Val-Val+Ile-Val vs Ile-Ile: OR = 1.127, 95%CI = 1.038-1.223, p = 0.004). Subgroup analysis indicated a significantassociation with susceptibility to breast cancer in African and Asianpopulations. However, such association was not observed in other ethnic groups.Our findings suggested that Her2 Ile655Val polymorphism is associated with breastcancer risk in overall, Asian and African populations, and can be used asdiagnostic marker for BC.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25769-y PMCID: PMC5943262PMID: 29743533
