However, conflicting survival benefits of pure dose-densechemotherapy have been reported in different randomized controlled trials (RCTs).This meta-analysis aimed to further assess the efficacy and safety of puredose-dense chemotherapy in breast cancer.METHODS: A literature search of electronic databases and websites was performedto identify phase III RCTs reporting the efficacy and toxicity of pure dose-densechemotherapy. The endpoints of interest were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicities. The hazard ratios (HRs) of death and recurrenceand the odds ratios (ORs) of adverse events were estimated and pooled.RESULTS: Seven studies (five trials) were eligible, encompassing a total of 9851 patients. Patients treated with dose-dense chemotherapy obtained better DFS(HR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.75-0.91; p = 0.0001) than those treated with theconventional schedule, while OS benefit of dose-dense chemotherapy was lessimpressive (HR = 0.86; 95% CI 0.73-1.02; p = 0.08). However, significant OSbenefit was observed in node-positive patients (HR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.66-0.90;p = 0.001). The incidence of anemia, pain, and transaminase elevation was higher in the dose-dense chemotherapy arm.CONCLUSIONS: Dose-dense chemotherapy leads to better prognosis; these findingssuggest that it may be a potentially preferred treatment for breast cancerpatients, particularly for women with lymph node involvement. However, more RCTs are warranted to better define the best candidates for dose-dense chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1424-4 PMCID: PMC6046095PMID: 30007402
