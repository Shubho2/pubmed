Clinical trialshave demonstrated that the use of PST is equally to adjuvant treatments in terms of overall survival, and has the advantage of increasing rates of breastconservative surgery and rates of pathologic complete response, a surrogateendpoint for the effectiveness of systemic therapy. Initial studies havesuggested higher rates of locoregional recurrence with this approach. However,the optimization of systemic and targeted therapy and the multidisciplinary care is key to achieving optimal outcomes in this setting.Copyright © 2018.
