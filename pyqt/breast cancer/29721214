The Laurénclassification of GC was most widely used in clinical practice since it reflects GC morphology, epidemiology, tumor biology, clinical management and outcome.Despite the initial promise of individualizing antitumor treatment, themanagement of GC still remains relatively broad and general. Apart from clinical staging, molecular profiling enables targeting of the identified underlyingalterations, rather than histology. In contrast to breast carcinoma, molecularclassification of GC does not yet imply treatment modality. Molecularclassifications of GC and their therapeutic implications are thereforeextensively studied. The current proposed molecular divisions of GC come fromthree different parts of the world where different standard treatment modalities for advanced GC are recommended. Wider use of GC molecular subtyping may solveproblems, such as susceptibility to novel systemic therapy regimens or selection of patients for aggressive surgery and targeted adjuvant/conversion therapy. Inany case, the rapid entry of novel molecular targeted therapies into routineoncology practice clearly underscores the urgent need for clinicians to be aware of these new possibilities.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24827 PMCID: PMC5922408PMID: 29721214
