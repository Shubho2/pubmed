This burden could affect their decisionsduring treatment. We developed a method to use census tracts and zip codes todetermine commuting burden for patients with breast cancer with online mappingservices, while protecting patient addresses from third parties. We found thatpatients who lived farther from Vanderbilt had fewer unique appointment days and more appointments scheduled per day. Total burden decreased over time afterdiagnosis, but advanced stage patients had sustained high levels of commute time until ten months after diagnosis. Additionally, we found that patients who lived far from Vanderbilt were less likely to receive radiotherapy from Vanderbilt.With the amount of work patients put into traveling for care, understandingcommuting burden could help healthcare organizations form strategies to improveaccess to care and compliance with care plans.PMCID: PMC5977705PMID: 29854120
