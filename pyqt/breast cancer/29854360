A double short distance slot coaxial antenna as a newly optimized applicator for minimally invasive treatment of breast cancer isproposed. To validate and to analyze the feasibility of using this method inclinical treatment, a computational model, phantom, and breast swine in vivoexperimentation were carried out, by using four microwave powers (50 W, 30 W,20 W, and 10 W). The finite element method (FEM) was used to develop thecomputational model. Phantom experimentation was carried out in breast phantom.The in vivo experimentation was carried out in a 90 kg swine sow. Tissue damagewas estimated by comparing control and treated micrographs of the porcine mammarygland samples. The coaxial slot antenna was inserted in swine breast glands byusing image-guided ultrasound. In all cases, modeling, in vivo and phantomexperimentation, and ablation temperatures (above 60°C) were reached. The in vivoexperiments suggest that this new MWA applicator could be successfully used toeliminate precise and small areas of tissue (around 20-30 mm2). By modulating thepower and time applied, it may be possible to increase/decrease the ablationarea.DOI: 10.1155/2018/5806753 PMCID: PMC5964617PMID: 29854360
