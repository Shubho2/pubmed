Sections of formalin-fixedparaffin-embedded tissue blocks were immunostained for gross cystic disease fluidprotein-15 (GCDFP-15) and androgen receptor (AR), to prove apocrinedifferentiation and correlate it with areas of GHRH-R expression. All but one of 19 tumours with apocrine epithelium and all five benign apocrine glands stainedwith both anti-GHRH-R antibodies used, each labelling a different domain of thereceptor. Non-apocrine areas of the tumours and four eccrine tumours withoutoxyphilic features did not stain, but most sebaceous glands and some eccrineglands were labelled. Our data suggest that anti-GHRH-R antibodies highlightapocrine differentiation at extramammary sites also. Although GHRH-R seems tohave a sensitivity comparable to classic apocrine markers such as AR andGCDFP-15, it seems to be inferior in specificity. The GHRH-R labelling ofapocrine glands and neoplastic epithelium might also interfere with the emerging anti-GHRH targeted treatment of some malignancies acting on these receptors.DOI: 10.5114/pjp.2018.75336 PMID: 29895126  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
