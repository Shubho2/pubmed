Lisheng.Wang@uottawa.ca.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most refractory subtype of breastcancer. It causes the majority of breast cancer-related deaths, which has beenlargely associated with the plasticity of tumor cells and persistence of cancerstem cells (CSCs). Conventional chemotherapeutics enrich CSCs and lead to drugresistance and disease relapse. Development of a strategy capable of inhibitingboth bulk and CSC populations is an unmet medical need. Inhibitors againstestrogen receptor 1, HDACs, or mTOR have been studied in the treatment of TNBC;however, the results are inconsistent. In this work, we found that patient TNBCsamples expressed high levels of mTORC1 and HDAC genes in comparison to luminalbreast cancer samples. Furthermore, co-inhibition of mTORC1 and HDAC withrapamycin and valproic acid, but neither alone, reproducibly promoted ESR1expression in TNBC cells. In combination with tamoxifen (inhibiting ESR1), bothS6RP phosphorylation and rapamycin-induced 4E-BP1 upregulation in TNBC bulk cellswas inhibited. We further showed that fractionated CSCs expressed higher levelsof mTORC1 and HDAC than non-CSCs. As a result, co-inhibition of mTORC1, HDAC, andESR1 was capable of reducing both bulk and CSC subpopulations as well as theconversion of fractionated non-CSC to CSCs in TNBC cells. These observations werepartially recapitulated with the cultured tumor fragments from TNBC patients.Furthermore, co-administration of rapamycin, valproic acid, and tamoxifenretarded tumor growth and reduced CD44high/+/CD24low/- CSCs in a human TNBCxenograft model and hampered tumorigenesis after secondary transplantation. Sincethe drugs tested are commonly used in clinic, this study provides a newtherapeutic strategy and a strong rationale for clinical evaluation of thesecombinations for the treatment of patients with TNBC.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0811-7 PMCID: PMC6062597PMID: 30050079
