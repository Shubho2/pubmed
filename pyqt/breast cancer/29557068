In the present study, theeffects of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) on breast cancer aggressiveness and bonemetastases were investigated.METHODS: MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) cells were treated in the presence or absence ofanti-human IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) monoclonal antibody and examined with respect tocell survival. The expressions of signal transducer and activator oftranscription 3 (Stat3), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. MDA-231cells were injected into the left ventricle of mice, and then anti-human IL-6Rmonoclonal antibody or saline was administered intraperitoneally for 28 days.After 28 days, the incidence of bone metastases was evaluated in the hind limbsby radiography and histology.RESULTS: Anti-human IL-6R monoclonal antibody reduced bone metastases in ananimal model injected with MDA-231 cells on radiological and histomorphometricanalyses. The mechanism of bone metastasis inhibition involved inhibited cellproliferation and decreased expressions of phospho-Stat3, VEGF, and RANK inMDA-231 cells.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest that inhibition of IL-6signaling may become a preventive therapeutic option for breast cancer and bonemetastases.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0853-9 PMID: 29557068
