While many studies have explored the role of the microenvironmenton cell behavior, the influence of 3D matrix mechanics on intracellular activity is not completely understood. To characterize the relationship between themechanical components of the microenvironment and intracellular behavior, we use particle-tracking microrheology of metastatic breast cancer cells embedded in 3D collagen gels to quantify the intracellular activity from which the molecularmotor activity and stiffness can be determined. Our results show that increasing collagen concentration of the 3D environments leads to an increase inintracellular stiffness and motor activity. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that intracellular fluctuations depend on collagen concentration, even in thepresence of a number of frontline chemotherapeutic and anti-MMP drugs, indicatingthat ECM concentration is an important and indispensable parameter to consider indrug screening.DOI: 10.1039/c8ib00044a PMCID: PMC5916796 [Available on 2019-04-23]PMID: 29620778
