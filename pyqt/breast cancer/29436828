Here, we report thesynthesis, characterization, and biological activity of a novel heterodinuclearPt(IV)-Ru(II) anticancer prodrug. The Pt(IV)-Ru(II) complex exhibits goodstability in both water and PBS solution. Biological evaluation revealed thatthis bifunctional Pt(IV)-Ru(II) complex utilizes the advantages of two metalcenters to have both cytotoxicity and antimetastatic property as designed.Although the complex has comparable cytotoxicities to cisplatin in tested cancer cell lines, this prodrug selectively kills cancer but not normal cells, and theIC50 values of the Pt(IV)-Ru(II) complex are 7-10 times higher than those ofcisplatin toward normal cells. The cancer cell selectivity is furtherdemonstrated by a cancer-normal cell coculture system. In addition, theantimetastatic properties of the heterodinuclear complex are assessed by usinghighly metastatic human breast cancer cells, and the results show that themigration and invasion of cancer cells are effectively restrained after thetreatment. Moreover, the Pt(IV)-Ru(II) complex displays lower toxicity thancisplatin in developing zebrafish embryos. We, therefore, report an example ofheterodinuclear Pt(IV)-Ru(II) complex not only to defeat both drug resistance andcancer metastasis but also having significantly improved cancer cell selectivity and reduced in vivo toxicity than cisplatin.DOI: 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00053 PMID: 29436828  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
