Streptomyces aegyptia strain NEAE-102 exhibited high level ofextracellular cholesterol oxidase production using a minimum medium containingcholesterol as the sole source of carbon. Fifteen variables were screened usingPlackett-Burman design for the enhanced cholesterol oxidase production. The most significant variables affecting enzyme production were further optimized by usingthe face-centered central composite design. The statistical optimization resultedin an overall 4.97-fold increase (15.631 UmL-1) in cholesterol oxidase productionin the optimized medium as compared with the unoptimized medium before applyingPlackett Burman design (3.1 UmL-1). The purified cholesterol oxidase wasevaluated for its in vitro anticancer activities against five human cancer celllines. The selectivity index values on rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer celllines were 3.26 and 2.56; respectively. The in vivo anticancer activity ofcholesterol oxidase was evaluated against Ehrlich solid tumor model. Comparedwith control mice, tumors growth was significantly inhibited in the mice injectedwith cholesterol oxidase alone, doxorubicin alone and cholesteroloxidase/doxorubicin combination by 60.97%, 72.99% and 97.04%; respectively. Theseresults demonstrated that cholesterol oxidase can be used as a promising natural anticancer drug.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-20786-3 PMCID: PMC5807524PMID: 29426900
