We set out to test how human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs)modulate ER signaling and downstream cellular responses. We exposed anorganotypic mammary model consisting of a collagen-embedded duct structure lined with MCF7 cells to 17-β estradiol (E2), with and without HMFs in the surrounding matrix. MCF7 cells grown as ductal structures were polarized and proliferated at rates comparable to in vivo breast tissue. In both culture platforms, exposure toE2 increased ER transactivation, increased proliferation, and induced ductalhyperplasia. When the surrounding matrix contained HMFs, the onset and severityof E2-induced ductal hyperplasia was increased due to decreased apoptosis. Thereduced apoptosis may be due to fibroblasts modulating ER signaling in MCF7cells, as suggested by the increased ER transactivation and reduced ER protein inMCF7 cells grown in co-culture. These findings demonstrate the utility oforganotypic platforms when studying stromal:epithelial interactions, and add toexisting literature that implicate the mammary microenvironment in ER + breastcancer progression.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25461-1 PMCID: PMC5940820PMID: 29740030
