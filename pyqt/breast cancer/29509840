MSR1-regulated genes were found to have specific molecular roles, such as serine-proteaseactivity (P = 4.80 × 10-7) and ion channel activity (P = 2.7 × 10-4). Thekallikrein locus was found to contain a large number of MSR1 clusters, and atleast six of these showed CNV. An MSR1 cluster was identified within KLK14, with 9 and 11 copies being normal variants. A significant association with the 9-copy allele and non-familial breast cancer was found in two independent populations(P = 0.004; P = 0.03). In the white British population, the minor alleleconferred an increased risk of 1.21-3.51 times for all non-familial disease, or1.7-5.3 times in early-onset disease. The 9-copy allele was also found to beassociated with increased risk of prostate cancer in an independent population(odds ratio = 1.27-1.56; P =0.009).Conclusions: MSR1 repeats act as molecular switches that modulate geneexpression. It is likely that CNV of MSR1 will affect risk of development ofvarious forms of cancer, including that of breast and prostate. The MSR1 cluster at KLK14 represents the strongest risk factor identified to date in non-familial breast cancer and a significant risk factor for prostate cancer. Analysis of MSR1genotype will allow development of precise stratification of disease risk andprovide a novel target for therapeutic agents.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy082 PMID: 29509840
