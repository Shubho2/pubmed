Although metastases are infrequent in Tmic carcinoma patients, surgical treatmenttypically includes lymph node sampling. The objective of this study was todetermine the rate and predictors of lymph node metastases, recurrence, andsurvival in a large series of Tmic breast carcinomas. Consecutive cases of Tmicwere identified within our health care system from 2001 to 2015. We reviewedresults of lymph node sampling and other pathologic factors including hormonereceptor/HER2 status, associated in situ tumor size/grade, margin status, number of invasive foci, surgical/adjuvant therapies, and recurrence/survival outcomes. In this cohort, 294 Tmic cases were identified with mean follow-up of 4.6 years. Of 260 patients who underwent axillary staging, lymph node metastases wereidentified in 1.5% (all of which were ductal type). All Tmic cases with positive lymph node metastases had associated DCIS with size > 5 cm (5.3-8.5 cm) compared to a median DCIS tumor size of 2.5 cm (0.2-19.0 cm) for the entire cohort. Nolymph node metastases were seen with microinvasive lobular carcinoma. During the follow-up period, there were no regional/distant recurrences or breastcancer-associated deaths in a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years. Two patientsdeveloped subsequent ipsilateral breast cancer (DCIS) in a different quadrantthan the original Tmic. Clinical behavior of microinvasive breast cancer in this series is similar to DCIS. Lymph node metastases are uncommon and were only seen with ductal type microinvasive carcinoma. Our data suggest limited benefit forroutine node sampling and support management of Tmic similar to DCIS,particularly for patients with DCIS < 5 cm in size.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13001 PMID: 29476574
