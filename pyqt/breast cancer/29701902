[Epubahead of print]Low doses of Paclitaxel repress breast cancer invasion through DJ-1/KLF17signalling pathway.Ismail IA(1)(2), El-Sokkary GH(3), Saber SH(2).Author information: (1)Faculty of Science, Department of Biology, Taibah University, Saudi, Arabia.(2)Faculty of Science, Department of Zoology, Laboratory of Molecular CellBiology, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.(3)Faculty of Science, Department of Zoology, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.Paclitaxel (taxol) is an important agent against many tumours, including breastcancer. Ample data documents that paclitaxel inhibits breast cancer metastasiswhile others prove that paclitaxel enhances breast cancer metastasis. Themechanisms by which paclitaxel exerts its action are not well established. Thisstudy focuses on the effect of paclitaxel, particularly the low doses on breastcancer metastasis and the mechanisms that regulate it. Current results show that,paclitaxel exerts significant cytotoxicity even at low doses in both MCF-7 andMDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, paclitaxel significantly inhibits cell invasion and migration, decreases Snail and increases E-cadherin mRNA expression levels atthe indicated low doses. Furthermore, paclitaxel-inhibiting breast cancermetastasis is associated with down-regulation of DJ-1 and ID-1 mRNA expressionlevel with a concurrent increase in KLF17 expression. Under the same experimentalconditions, paclitaxel induces KLF17 and concurrently represses ID-1 proteinlevels. Our results show for the first time that paclitaxel inhibits breastcancer metastasis through regulating DJ-1/KLF17/ID-1 signalling pathway;repressed DJ-1 and ID-1 and enhanced KLF17 expression.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/1440-1681.12960 PMID: 29701902
