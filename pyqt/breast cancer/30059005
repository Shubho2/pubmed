In a genome-scale expression screen for inducers of theepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we found a striking enrichment ofRNA-binding proteins. We validated that QKI and RBFOX1 were necessary andsufficient to induce an intermediate mesenchymal cell state and increasedtumorigenicity. Using RNA-seq and eCLIP analysis, we found that QKI and RBFOX1coordinately regulated the splicing and function of the actin-binding proteinFLNB, which plays a causal role in the regulation of EMT. Specifically, theskipping of FLNB exon 30 induced EMT by releasing the FOXC1 transcription factor.Moreover, skipping of FLNB exon 30 is strongly associated with EMT genesignatures in basal-like breast cancer patient samples. These observationsidentify a specific dysregulation of splicing, which regulates tumor cellplasticity and is frequently observed in human cancer.Â© 2018, Li et al.DOI: 10.7554/eLife.37184 PMID: 30059005
