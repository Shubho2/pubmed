The pseudokinaseHER3, heterodimerisation partner of HER2, is widely implicated in the resistance to HER2-mediated therapy. Here, we show that lapatinib, an ATP-competitiveinhibitor of HER2, is able to induce proliferation cooperatively with the HER3ligand neuregulin. This counterintuitive synergy between inhibitor and growthfactor depends on their ability to promote atypical HER2-HER3 heterodimerisation.By stabilising a particular HER2 conformer, lapatinib drives HER2-HER3 kinasedomain heterocomplex formation. This dimer exists in a head-to-head orientationdistinct from the canonical asymmetric active dimer. The associated clusteringobserved for these dimers predisposes to neuregulin responses, affording aproliferative outcome. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into theliabilities involved in targeting kinases with ATP-competitive inhibitors andhighlight the complex role of protein conformation in acquired resistance.Â© 2018, Claus et al.DOI: 10.7554/eLife.32271 PMCID: PMC5929906PMID: 29712619
