We use the unique characteristics of small molecules to probe andselectively modulate cell motility. By coupling efficient chemical synthesisroutes to multiple upfront in parallel phenotypic screens, we identify thatKBU2046 inhibits cell motility and cell invasion in vitro. Across three differentmurine models of human prostate and breast cancer, KBU2046 inhibits metastasis,decreases bone destruction, and prolongs survival at nanomolar bloodconcentrations after oral administration. Comprehensive molecular, cellular andsystemic-level assaysÂ all support a high level of selectivity. KBU2046 bindschaperone heterocomplexes, selectively alters binding of client proteins thatregulate motility, and lacks all the hallmarks of classical chaperone inhibitors,including toxicity. We identify a unique cell motility regulatory mechanism andsynthesize a targeted therapeutic, providing a platform to pursue studies inhumans.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04465-5 PMCID: PMC6014988PMID: 29934502
