Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a typical inflammation-relatedcancer. However, little is known about the relationship between HCC and HMGB1 andits receptor RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products). This studyanalyzes the clinicopathological relevance of HMGB1 expression level and theeffect of HMGB1 expression on the characteristics of HCC.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from 75 HCC patients including 13 with positivehepatitis B surface antigen and 36 with hepatitis C antibody were studied. Theexpression of HMGB1 in paired cancer and non-cancerous tissues from patients withHCC was assessed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)and western blotting. Quantitative RT-PCR data were analyzed in association with the clinicopathological factors of patients with HCC.RESULTS: The expression of HMGB1 mRNA in HCC was high in well-differentiatedtumors, but declined as tumors dedifferentiated to moderately and poorlydifferentiated HCC. The levels of HMGB1 mRNA showed a negative correlation withthe presence of portal invasion (p=0.005) and the rise of serum PIVKA-II(p=0.034). There was no clear correlation between HMGB1 expression andproliferation activity of HCC using Ki-67 staining.CONCLUSION: In HCC, HMGB1 expression level correlated inversely with tumordifferentiation. The RAGE-HMGB1 interaction may play a greater role in the early stages of HCC tumorigenesis than during cancer development.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12609 PMID: 29848691  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
