In a prospective studyof 483,241 Norwegian women aged 50-69 years at baseline, 7656 women developedbreast cancer during follow-up (2006-2013). We combined baseline information onrecalled body mass in childhood/adolescence and current (baseline) body massindex (BMI) to construct mutually exclusive life-course body mass patterns. Weassessed associations of current HT use with breast cancer risk according tobaseline BMI and life-course patterns of body mass, and estimated relative excessrisk due to interaction (RERI). Within all levels of baseline BMI, HT use wasassociated with increased risk. Considering life-course body mass patterns as asingle exposure, we used women who "remained at normal weight" through life asthe reference, and found that being "overweight as young" was associated withlower risk (hazard ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-0.94),whereas women who "gained weight" had higher risk (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12-1.28).Compared to never users of HT who were "overweight as young", HT users who either"remained at normal weight" or "gained weight" in adulthood were at higher riskthan expected when adding the separate risks (RERI 0.52, 95% CI 0.09-0.95, andRERI 0.37, 95% CI - 0.07-0.80), suggesting effect modification. Thus, we foundthat women who remain at normal weight or gain weight in adulthood may be moresusceptible to the risk increasing effect of HT compared to women who wereoverweight as young.DOI: 10.1007/s10654-018-0431-7 PMID: 30083811
