Worryingly, a recentcohort study found breast cancer patients who used CCBs had higher death rates,but interpreting these results was difficult as they were based on all-causemortality and medication use before cancer diagnosis. We used UK population-baseddata to more robustly investigate the association between CCB use andcancer-specific mortality.METHODS: We selected a cohort of patients with breast cancer diagnosed between1998 and 2012 from English cancer registries. We linked to prescription andclinical records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, and to deathrecords from the Office for National Statistics. We used adjusted, time-dependentCox regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) comparing breastcancer-specific and all-cause mortality between postdiagnostic CCB users andnonusers.RESULTS: Our cohort included 23,669 breast cancer patients, of whom 5,141 usedCCBs and 3,053 died due to their breast cancer during follow-up. Afteradjustment, CCB users had similar breast cancer-specific mortality to nonusers(HR = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88, 1.08). There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship. We found similar associations for specific CCBs,and for all-cause mortality.CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based breast cancer cohort, we did not findany evidence that CCB use is associated with increased mortality.DOI: 10.1097/EDE.0000000000000814 PMID: 29608546
