Usingnonparametric statistics, we assessed the content, readability, and culturalappropriateness of 235 webpages.Results: Eighty-two percent of webpages referred to research studies in theircontent. For the majority of sites, readability was at a high-school readinggrade level. Webpages were not explicitly intended for specific racial/ethnicgroups.Discussion: Technical language and non-culturally specific messages may hinderusers' attention to and comprehension of online breast cancer information.Additional research is needed to examine in-depth the accuracy of this onlinecontent.Translation to Health Education Practice: Findings suggest that collaborationsbetween scientists, health educators, website designers/media professionals, and the community will be critical to the delivery of accurate, up-to-date,plain-language, and culturally sensitive information about breast cancer and the environment.DOI: 10.1080/19325037.2018.1473182 PMCID: PMC6075842PMID: 30079123
