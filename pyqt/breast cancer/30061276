QOL (EORTC QLQ-BM22), fatigue (EORTC QLQ FA13), andemotional distress (QSC-R10) at the end of radiotherapy, along with 3- and6-month follow-up were assessed.RESULTS: At all recorded time points, there were no significant QOL differencesbetween cohorts, including painful sites, pain characteristics, functionalimpairment, or psychosocial aspects (p>0.05 for all). There were also nodifferences in all dimensions of fatigue between groups at each recorded timepoint (p>0.05 for all). Emotional distress was also similar at three (p=0.248)and six months (p=0.603).CONCLUSION: Although these results demonstrate that SBRT does not cause worse QOLdeteriorations compared to 3DCRT, larger randomized investigations arerecommended to corroborate these findings.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12814 PMID: 30061276  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
