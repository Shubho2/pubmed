Less is known,whether the tumour characteristics of breast cancer have changed over time intomore favourable in general and whether the changes have been similar in all ages.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to explore the change of breastcancer characteristics in parallel to the implementation of modern diagnosticmethods in three age groups over four 5-year time periods between 1992 and 2011. The data from 942 primary breast cancers in one university hospital district inFinland were combined with data from the Finnish Cancer Registry and the MassScreening Registry. The association of favourable tumour characteristics withtime period, age group and diagnostic methods was explored.RESULTS: The most discernible secular change was the increase in oestrogen(ER)-positive cancers in every consecutive time period. The risk for ERpositivity in the second, third and fourth period was 2- to 2.71-fold compared tothe first period. An increase in small tumours and node-negative tumours wasdetected during the most recent years of data collection. The secular changeswere observed in all age groups; however, overall ER positivity was most frequentamong women beyond screening age and small tumours among screening-aged women.The increase in small and node-negative tumours could partly be explained by the implementation of new radiological methods.CONCLUSIONS: This study detected a secular change of tumour characteristics into more favourable irrespective of age group. If the trend continues, it seems that we are going to have a breast cancer population of mainly small ER-positivebreast cancers in the future forcing to rethink the therapeutic approach.DOI: 10.1080/0284186X.2018.1479073 PMID: 29882462
