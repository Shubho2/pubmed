Molecular docking was performed to simulate the interactions. Their activities on GPER pathways were investigated by detecting calciummobilization and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in SKBR3cells. The effects on SKBR3 cell migration were investigated using Boyden chamberand wound-healing assays.RESULTS: Our results showed that 11 of the OH-PBDEs but none of the PBDEs boundto GPER directly. Relative binding affinities ranged from 1.3% to 20.0% compared to 17β-estradiol. Docking results suggested that the hydroxyl group played anessential role in the binding of OH-PBDEs to GPER by forming hydrogen bondinteractions. Most of the OH-PBDEs activated subsequent GPER signaling pathways. Among them, 4'-OH-BDE-049, 5'-OH-BDE-099, and 3'-OH-BDE-154 displayed the highestactivity with lowest effective concentrations (LOECs) of 10-100 nM. These threeOH-PBDEs also promoted SKBR3 cell migration via GPER pathways with LOECs of 0.1-1μM.CONCLUSION: OH-PBDEs could bind to GPER, activate the subsequent signalingpathways, and promote SKBR3 cell migration via GPER pathways. OH-PBDEs mightexert estrogenic effects by a novel nongenomic mechanism involving the activationof GPER at nanomolar concentrations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2387.DOI: 10.1289/EHP2387 PMCID: PMC6071991PMID: 29790728
