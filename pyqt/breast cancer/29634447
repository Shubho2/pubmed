This study examined whether insomniaincreases the aforementioned risk and explored the effects of hypnotic use onthis relationship.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using dataretrieved from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Research Database 2010. Intotal, 11,021 patients with insomnia, who were categorized by hypnotic use andnonuse, were identified; 22,042 age-matched participants without insomnia werethen randomly selected. Cox proportional hazards regression was used for theanalyses.RESULTS: The insomnia cohort had a higher risk of breast cancer than did thecontrol cohort (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.43; 95% confidence interval[CI] = 1.10-1.84). The aHR was 1.09 for insomniac with hypnotics use, 1.41 forinsomniac without hypnotics use, and 0.71 for hypnotics users without insomnia(95% CIs = 0.71-1.68, 1.07-1.85, and 0.40-1.27) compared with those individualswithout insomnia who did not use hypnotics.CONCLUSION: This nationwide population-based cohort study reveals that insomniabut not hypnotic use is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1089/jwh.2017.6626 PMID: 29634447
