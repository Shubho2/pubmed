The bismuth selenide nanoparticle(Bi2 Se3 NP) is synthesized and sandwiched between the gold electrode and anotherAu-deposited thin layer (Bi2 Se3 @Au). Then, eight-silver-ion mediateddouble-stranded DNA (mDNA) is immobilized onto the substrate (Bi2 Se3 @Au-mDNA)for the further detection of hydrogen peroxide. The Bi2 Se3 NP acts as theelectrochemical-signal booster, while unprecedentedly its encapsulation by the Authin layer keeps the TI surface states protected, improves itselectrochemical-signal stability and provides an excellent platform for thesubsequent covalent immobilization of the mDNA through Au-thiol interaction.Electrochemical results show that the fabricated biosensor represents much higherAg+ redox current (≈10 times) than those electrodes prepared without Bi2 Se3 @Au.The characterization of the Bi2 Se3 @Au-mDNA film is confirmed by atomic forcemicroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The proposedbiosensor shows a dynamic range of 00.10 × 10-6 m to 27.30 × 10-6 m, very lowdetection limit (10 × 10-9 m), unique current response (1.6 s), sound H2 O2recovery in serum, and substantial capability to classify two breast cancersubtypes (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) based on their difference in the H2 O2generation, offering potential applications in the biomedicine and pharmacologyfields.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
