However, they are all associated with potential long-term adverseeffects. This case report discusses a case of choroidal metastasis from primarybreast carcinoma that regressed after single-agent chemotherapy.Case presentation: We report a case of choroidal metastasis from estrogenreceptor (ER) positive breast carcinoma that became resistant to endocrinetherapy. The primary malignancy was treated with surgical resection and adjuvant chemoradiation, followed by hormone therapy with various agents in combinationwith kinase inhibitors for ER resistance. The choroidal metastatic lesionregressed after the initiation of vinorelbine. Vinorelbine is a cytotoxic vincaalkaloid with tolerable systemic adverse effects.Conclusions: This case report highlights the possible role of vinorelbine as asingle chemotherapeutic agent for the conservative therapy of uveal metastasisfrom advanced breast carcinoma, irrespective of responsiveness to hormonetherapy.DOI: 10.1186/s40942-018-0121-3 PMCID: PMC5950186PMID: 29785284
