Individuals must disclose genetic test results known to them inapplications for new or updated policies including cover for critical care,income protection and death. There is limited information regarding howunderwriting decisions are made for policies with such disclosures. TheAustralian Financial Services Council (FSC) provided de-identified data collectedon applications with genetic test result disclosure from its life insurancemember companies 2010-2013 to enable repetition of an independent examinationundertaken of applications 1999-2003: age; gender; genetic condition; testingresult; decision-maker; and insurance cover. Data was classified as to testresult alone or additional other factors relevant to risk and decision. Wherenecessary, the FSC facilitated clarification by insurers. 345/548 applicationsrelated to adult-onset conditions. The genetic test result solely influenced the decision in 165/345 applications: positive (n = 23), negative (n = 139) andpending (n = 3). Detailed analyses of the decisions in each of these resultcategories are presented with specific details of 11 test cases. Policies withstandard decisions were provided for all negative test results with evidence ofreassessment of previous non-standard decisions and 20/23 positive results withrecognition of risk reduction strategies. Disclosure of positive results forbreast/ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome and hereditary spastic paraplegia, andthree pending results, generated non-standard decisions. The examinationdemonstrates some progress in addressing concerns in regard to utilisation ofgenetic test information but the self-regulatory system in Australia only goessome way in meeting internationally recommended best practice.DOI: 10.1038/s41431-018-0198-z PMID: 29891881
