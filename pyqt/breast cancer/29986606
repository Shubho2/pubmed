Recently, it was noted that most of the beneficial effects of milk comefrom their nanoparticles, especially exosomes. Herein, we evaluated theanticancer potential of camel milk and its exosomes on MCF7 breast cancer cells(in vitro and in vivo) and investigated the possible underlying molecularmechanism of action.METHODS/RESULTS: Administration of camel milk (orally) and its exosomes (orallyand by local injection) decreased breast tumor progression as evident by ( a)higher apoptosis (indicated by higher DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activity, Bax gene expression, and lower Bcl2 gene expression), ( b) remarkable inhibition ofoxidative stress (decrease in MDA levels and iNOS gene expression); ( c)induction of antioxidant status (increased activities of SOD, CAT, and GPX), ( d)notable reduction in expression of inflammation-( IL1b, NFÎºB), angiogenesis-(VEGF) and metastasis-( MMP9, ICAM1) related genes; and ( e) higher immuneresponse (high number of CD+4, CD+8, NK1.1 T cells in spleen).CONCLUSIONS: Overall, administration of camel milk-derived exosomes showed betteranticancer effect, but less immune response, than treatment by camel milk.Moreover, local injection of exosomes led to better improvement than oraladministration. These findings suggest that camel milk and its exosomes haveanticancer effect possibly through induction of apoptosis and inhibition ofoxidative stress, inflammation, angiogenesis and metastasis in the tumormicroenvironment. Thus, camel milk and its exosomes could be used as ananticancer agent for cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1177/1534735418786000 PMID: 29986606
