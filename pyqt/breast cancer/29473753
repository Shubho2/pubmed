However, rational design is still needed to further improve the in situ penetrationefficiency of chemo-drug-loaded membrane delivery-system formulations and theirrelease profiles at the tumor site. Here, a macrophage-membrane-coatednanoparticle is developed for tumor-targeted chemotherapy delivery with acontrolled release profile in response to tumor microenvironment stimuli. Uponfulfilling its mission of tumor homing and RES evasion, the macrophage-membranecoating can be shed via morphological changes driven by extracellularmicroenvironment stimuli. The nanoparticles discharged from the outer membranecoating show penetration efficiency enhanced by their size advantage and surface modifications. After internalization by the tumor cells, the loaded drug isquickly released from the nanoparticles in response to the endosome pH. Thedesigned macrophage-membrane-coated nanoparticle (cskc-PPiP/PTX@Ma) exhibits anenhanced therapeutic effect inherited from both membrane-derived tumor homing andstep-by-step controlled drug release. Thus, the combination of a biomimetic cell membrane and a cascade-responsive polymeric nanoparticle embodies an effectivedrug delivery system tailored to the tumor microenvironment.DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b05263 PMID: 29473753
