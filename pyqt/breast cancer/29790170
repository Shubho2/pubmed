The objective of this study was to determine the optimal mammography-based method of BV estimation.METHODS: Mammography data was obtained for patients who underwent mastectomy for breast cancer from 2005 to 2015. This data was used to calculate BV using fourpreviously published equations. Results were compared to mastectomy specimenvolumes calculated from specimen weights and breast density. Five practitionersthen independently assessed reproducibility and ease of use.RESULTS: Complete mammographic measurements were available for 65 breasts from 45patients. Median age was 58 years (range 19-82). Mammographic breast densityscores were available for 62 breasts. Of the 65 mastectomies performed, 16 (36%) were simple mastectomies. The equation BV = 1/3πRcc Rmlo Hmlo most closelyapproximated actual breast specimen volumes (R = 0.89, P < 0.0001). Internalcorrelation of calculated BV was excellent among all practitioners (lowestPearson R = 0.963).CONCLUSIONS: Breast volumes can be reliably estimated utilizing measurements froma preoperative mammogram. This low-cost method of volumetric analysis can beemployed to guide surgical decision making in treatment of patients with invasivebreast cancer.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jso.25076 PMID: 29790170
