[Epub ahead of print]Comparison of heart dose in early-stage left-sided breast cancers treated withintraoperative radiation therapy or whole-breast irradiation with deepinspiratory breath hold.Alonso C(1), Janowski E(2), Libby B(2), Showalter S(3).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.Electronic address: cea3mw@virginia.edu.(2)Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.(3)Department of Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.PURPOSE: To compare heart dose between patients treated with lumpectomy andeither intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) with CT-guided high-dose-ratebrachytherapy (precision breast IORT [PB-IORT]) or whole-breast irradiation with deep inspiratory breath hold (WBI-DIBH) for early-stage left-sided breastcancers.METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively identified the 17 patients withleft-sided breast cancers treated with PB-IORT on a phase I clinical trial and 17patients with left-sided tumors who had undergone lumpectomy and adjuvantWBI-DIBH. Dosimetric data were obtained. T-testing was performed and biologicallyeffective doses (BEDs) were calculated using an α/β ratio of 2 Gy.RESULTS: Mean heart dose was significantly lower with WBI-DIBH compared withPB-IORT (0.61 vs. 0.87 Gy, p = 0.006). Mean heart BED was lower with WBI-DIBH(0.62 vs. 1.3 Gy2, p = 0.0001). Nominal maximum heart dose was higher withWBI-DIBH (11.37 vs. 4.81 Gy, p = 0.004). Maximum heart dose BED was similarbetween WBI-DIBH and IORT, 16.63 vs. 19.36 Gy (p = 0.64), respectively. Nodifference was found in mean left anterior descending artery dose: 2.18 Gy withWBI-DIBH and 1.89 Gy with IORT (p = 0.446). The maximum left anterior descending doses were 9.63 Gy and 3.62 Gy with WBI-DIBH and IORT, respectively (p = 0.016). Distance from the heart to the lumpectomy cavity was inversely associated withheart dose for PB-IORT, but not for WBI-IORT.CONCLUSIONS: Heart doses were low in both groups. Expected increase in cardiacrisk at these doses is minimal. It is unlikely that there will be a clinicallysignificant difference in cardiac toxicity in patients treated with WBI-DIBH orPB-IORT. Further research is needed to evaluate the actual clinical impact of theobserved cardiac doses delivered with these modalities.Copyright © 2018 American Brachytherapy Society.
