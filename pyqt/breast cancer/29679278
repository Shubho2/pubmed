Thyroidhormone receptors (TRs) mediate transcriptional responses through a highlyconserved DNA-binding domain (DBD). We previously constructed an artificiallymodified human TRβ1 (m-TRβ1) via the introduction of a 108-bp exon sequence into the corresponding position of the wild-type human TRβ1 (TRβ1) DBD. Studiesconfirmed that m-TRβ1 was functional and could inhibit the proliferation ofbreast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells in vitro. To understand the role of m-TRβ1 inliver tumor development, we adopted a gain-of-function approach by stablyexpressing TRβ (m-TRβ1 and TRβ1) genes in a human hepatocarcinoma cell line,SK-hep1 (without endogenous TRβ), and then evaluated the effects of the expressedTRβ on cancer cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth in cell-basedstudies and xenograft models. In the presence of 3,5,3-L-triiodothyronine (T3),the expression of TRβ in SK-hep1 cells inhibited cancer cell proliferation andimpeded tumor cell migration through the up-regulation of 4-1BB, Caspase-3, andBak gene expression; down-regulation of Bcl-2 gene expression; and activation of the Caspase-3 protein. TRβ expression in SK-hep1 led to less tumor growth inxenograft models. Additionally, the anti-tumor effect of m-TRβ1 was stronger thanthat of TRβ1. These data indicate that m-TRβ1 can act as a tumor suppressor inhepatocarcinoma and its role was significantly better than that of TRβ1.DOI: 10.1007/s11010-018-3357-1 PMID: 29679278
