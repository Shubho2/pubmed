A previous study reported that its imagingand targeting properties were related to mitochondria. However, the molecularmechanism behind the anticancer activity of IR-783 has not been welldemonstrated. In this study, we showed that IR-783 inhibits cell viability andinduces mitochondrial apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Exposure ofMDA-MB-231 cells to IR-783 resulted in the loss of mitochondrial membranepotential (MMP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, mitochondrialpermeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and cytochrome c (Cyto C) release.Furthermore, we found that IR-783 induced dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria, increased the expression ofmitochondrial fission proteins mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) and fission-1(Fis1), and decreased the expression of mitochondrial fusion proteins mitofusin1 (Mfn1) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1). Moreover, knockdown of Drp1 markedly blockedIR-783-mediated mitochondrial fission, loss of MMP, ATP depletion, mPTP openingand apoptosis. Our in vivo study confirmed that IR-783 markedly inhibited tumour growth and induced apoptosis in an MDA-MB-231 xenograft model in association withthe mitochondrial translocation of Drp1. Taken together, these findings suggestthat IR-783 induces apoptosis in human breast cancer cells by increasingDrp1-mediated mitochondrial fission. Our study uncovered the molecular mechanism of the anti-breast cancer effects of IR-783 and provided novel perspectives forthe application of IR-783 in the treatment of breast cancer.© 2018 The Authors.
