It also responds to severalcellular stresses such as UV irradiation and oxidative stress. The function ofFOXO3a is regulated by a complex network of processes, includingpost-transcriptional suppression by microRNAs (miRNAs), post-translationalmodifications (PTMs) and protein-protein interactions. FOXO3a is widelyimplicated in a variety of diseases, particularly in malignancy of breast, liver,colon, prostate, bladder, and nasopharyngeal cancers. Emerging evidences indicatethat FOXO3a acts as a tumor suppressor in cancer. FOXO3a is frequentlyinactivated in cancer cell lines by mutation of the FOXO3a gene or cytoplasmicsequestration of FOXO3a protein. And its inactivation is associated with theinitiation and progression of cancer. In experimental studies, overexpression of FOXO3a inhibits the proliferation, tumorigenic potential, and invasiveness ofcancer cells, while silencing of FOXO3a results in marked attenuation inprotection against tumorigenesis. The role of FOXO3a in both normal physiology aswell as in cancer development have presented a great challenge to formulating an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer. In this review, we summarize therecent findings and overview of the current understanding of the influence ofFOXO3a in cancer development and progression.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0856-3 PMCID: PMC6060507PMID: 30045773
