Using a custom-made breast cancer gene sequencing panel,we investigated somatic mutations in IBC to better understand the genomicdifferences compared with non-IBC and to consider new targeted therapy in IBCpatients.METHODS: Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 91 candidate breastcancer-associated genes was performed on 156 fresh-frozen breast tumor tissuesfrom IBC patients. Mutational profiles from 197 primary breast tumors from TheCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used as non-IBC controls for comparison analysis.The mutational landscape of IBC was correlated with clinicopathological data and outcomes.RESULTS: After genotype calling and algorithmic annotations, we identified 392deleterious variants in IBC and 320 variants in non-IBC cohorts, respectively.IBC tumors harbored more mutations than non-IBC (2.5 per sample vs. 1.6 persample, p < 0.0001). Eighteen mutated genes were significantly different between the two cohorts, namely TP53, CDH1, NOTCH2, MYH9, BRCA2, ERBB4, POLE, FGFR3,ROS1, NOTCH4, LAMA2, EGFR, BRCA1, TP53BP1, ESR1, THBS1, CASP8, and NOTCH1. InIBC, the most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (43.0%), PIK3CA (29.5%), MYH9(8.3%), NOTCH2 (8.3%), BRCA2 (7.7%), ERBB4 (7.1%), FGFR3 (6.4%), POLE (6.4%),LAMA2 (5.8%), ARID1A (5.1%), NOTCH4 (5.1%), and ROS1 (5.1%). After grouping 91genes on 10 signaling pathways, we found that the DNA repair pathway for thetriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subgroup, the RTK/RAS/MAPK and cell cyclepathways for the HR-/HER2+ subgroup, the DNA repair, RTK/RAS/MAPK, and NOTCHpathways for the HR+/HER2- subgroup, and the DNA repair, epigenome, and diversepathways for the HR+/HER2+ subgroup were all significantly differently alteredbetween IBC and non-IBC. PIK3CA mutation was independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival (MFS) in IBC since the median MFS for the PIK3CA mutant type was 26.0 months and for the PIK3CA wild type was 101.1 months (p = 0.002).This association was observed in TNBC (p = 0.04) and the HR-/HER2+ subgroups(p = 0.0003), but not in the HR+/HER2- subgroup of IBC.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer-specific targeted NGS uncovered a high frequency ofdeleterious somatic mutations in IBC, some of which may be relevant for clinical management.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1007-x PMID: 30086764
