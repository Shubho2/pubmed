What deserve to be mentioned is that Sal can efficiently induceproliferation inhibition, cell death and metastasis suppression against humancancers from different origins both in vivo and in vitro without causing serious side effects as the conventional chemotherapeutical drugs on the body. There may be novel cell death pathways involving the anticancer effects of Sal except theconventional pathways, such as autophagic pathway. This review is focused on how autophagy involves the effects of Sal, trying to describe clearly andsystematically why autophagy plays a vital role in predominant anticancer effectsof Sal, including its distinctive characteristic. Based on recent advances, wepresent evidence that a dual role of Sal involving in autophagy may account forits unique anticancer effects - the preference for cancer cells. Furtherresearches are required to confirm the authenticity of this suppose in order todevelop an ideal anticancer drug.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0680-z PMCID: PMC5809980PMID: 29433536
