The goal of this study is to examine the nutrition educationservices available on National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Designated Cancer Centers' websites. In 2017, websites of all 61 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers that provide adult clinical care were reviewed at least twice. Websites were analyzed for the existence and type of expert-directed nutrition education services for breastcancer survivors. Of the 61 websites analyzed, 49 (80%) provided informationabout nutrition education. Twenty (33%) included only nutrition counseling, three(5%) only nutrition classes, and 26 (42%) both counseling and classes. Forty-six websites included information about nutrition counseling; of these, 39 had aneasily identifiable description. Thirty-seven class options were offered, 22%were specific to breast cancer, 16% to subgroups such as young women, 41% werenutrition-only classes, and 24% included skills education. Nutrition services arean important part of breast cancer treatment. This study demonstrated that mostNCI-designated cancer centers offered counseling. However, the type ofinformation that was offered varied and services were not always specific topatients with breast cancer. Further research is needed to confirm the presenceof services, assess patient access, and demonstrate their efficacy in promotingoptimal survivor outcomes.DOI: 10.1007/s13187-018-1384-y PMID: 29978360
