However, the underlyingmechanism remains elusive. Here, we disclosed that the expression of ICAM3 wasclosely correlated with the TNM stage of human breast and lung cancer, as well asthe dominant overexpression in high aggressive tumor cell lines (231 and A549cells). Moreover, the knockdown of ICAM3 inhibited tumor metastasis whereas theectopic expression of ICAM3 promoted tumor metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, exploration of the underlying mechanism demonstrated that ICAM3 not only binds to LFA-1 with its extracellular domain and structure protein ERM butalso to lamellipodia with its intracellular domain which causes a tension thatpulls cells apart (metastasis). Furthermore, ICAM3 extracellular or intracellularmutants alternatively abolished ICAM3 mediated tumor metastasis in vitro and invivo. As a therapy strategy, LFA-1 antibody or Lifitegrast restrained tumormetastasis via targeting ICAM3-LFA-1 interaction. In summary, the aforementioned findings suggest a model of ICAM3 in mediating tumor metastasis. This may providea promising target or strategy for the prevention of tumor metastasis.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
