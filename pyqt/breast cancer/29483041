In order to maximise survival benefits of IMC radiotherapy, doses to the heart and lung should be minimised. Thisdosimetry study compared the ability of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy,arc therapy and proton beam therapy (PBT) techniques with and without breath-holdto achieve target volume constraints while minimising dose to organs at risk(OARs).MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 14 patients' datasets, seven IMC radiotherapytechniques were compared: wide tangent (WT) three-dimensional conformalradiotherapy, volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and PBT, each in voluntary deep inspiratory breath-hold (vDIBH) and free breathing (FB), and tomotherapy in FB only. Target volume coverage and OAR doses were measured for each technique.These were compared using a one-way ANOVA with all pairwise comparisons testedusing Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test, with adjusted P-values ≤ 0.05indicating statistical significance.RESULTS: One hundred per cent of WT(vDIBH), 43% of WT(FB), 100% of VMAT(vDIBH),86% of VMAT(FB), 100% of tomotherapy FB and 100% of PBT plans in vDIBH and FBpassed all mandatory constraints. However, coverage of the IMC with 90% of theprescribed dose was significantly better than all other techniques usingVMAT(vDIBH), PBT(vDIBH) and PBT(FB) (mean IMC coverage ± 1 standarddeviation = 96.0% ± 4.3, 99.8% ± 0.3 and 99.0% ± 0.2, respectively). The meanheart dose was significantly reduced in vDIBH compared with FB for both the WT(P < 0.0001) and VMAT (P < 0.0001) techniques. There was no advantage in targetvolume coverage or OAR doses for PBT(vDIBH) compared with PBT(FB).CONCLUSIONS: Simple WT radiotherapy delivered in vDIBH achieves satisfactorycoverage of the IMC while meeting heart and lung dose constraints. However, wherehigher isodose coverage is required, VMAT(vDIBH) is the optimal photon technique.The lowest OAR doses are achieved by PBT, in which the use of vDIBH does notimprove dose statistics.Crown Copyright © 2018.
