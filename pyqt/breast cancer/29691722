OncotypeDx is a multi-gene assay frequently used to predict the recurrence risk forestrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer, with values < 18 considered lowrisk; ≥ 18 and ≤ 30, intermediate risk; and > 30, high risk. Patients at a highrisk for recurrence are more likely to benefit from chemotherapy treatment.METHODS: In this study, clinicopathological parameters for 37 cases of earlybreast cancer with available Oncotype Dx results were used to estimate therecurrence score using the three new Magee equations. Correlation studies withOncotype Dx results were performed. Applying the same cutoff points as OncotypeDx, patients were categorized into low-, intermediate- and high-risk groupsaccording to their estimated recurrence scores.RESULTS: Pearson correlation coefficient (R) values between estimated and actual recurrence score were 0.73, 0.66, and 0.70 for Magee equations 1, 2 and 3,respectively. The concordance values between actual and estimated recurrencescores were 57.6%, 52.9%, and 57.6% for Magee equations 1, 2 and 3, respectively.Using standard pathologic measures and immunohistochemistry scores in these threelinear Magee equations, most low and high recurrence risk cases can be predicted with a strong positive correlation coefficient, high concordance and negligibletwo-step discordance.CONCLUSIONS: Magee equations are user-friendly and can be used to predict therecurrence score in early breast cancer cases.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0860-x PMID: 29691722
