This review looks at IBC from the pathologists pointof view. The diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis are summarized first.The staging implications are described next. Despite the overall poor prognosisof IBC, it is heterogeneous in terms of most prognostic and predictive factors(such as histological type, grade, receptor status, intrinsic subtype,inflammatory infiltrate). It seems that some molecular features (genes expressed)are unique to IBC, and this may help to identify them as IBC at the molecularlevel. The key carcinogenetic pathways activated in IBC, the inflammatorypathways present in the disease as well as the relation of IBC to cancer stemcells are also briefly covered. Due to the relative rarity of IBC, preclinicaltrials are very important in the study of this entity, and models with stromaland microenvironmental elements are expected to outperform the traditional modelswithout these features, as the microenvironment seems to be a key component ofIBC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
