Our aim was tounderstand the involvement of the inherited mutations in these genes in a breast cancer cohort. Two hundred ninety-six female breast cancer patients including4.5% of familial breast cancer cases were included in the study. 200Â ng ofgenomic DNA was used to evaluate the pathogenic mutations, detected using Global Screening Array (GSA) microchip (Illumina Inc.) according to the manufacturer'sinstructions. The pathogenic frameshift and nonsense mutations were observed inBRCA2 (10.9%), MLH1 (58.6%), MTHFR (50%), MSH2 (14.2%), and CYTB (52%) genes.Familial breast cancer patients (4.5%) had variations in BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2, andCYTB genes. 28% of patients with metastasis, recurrence, and death harboredmono/biallelic alterations in MSH2, MLH1, and BRCA2 genes. The results of thisstudy can guide to develop a panel to test the breast cancer patients forpathogenic mutations, from Malwa region of Punjab. The screening of MSH2, MLH1,and BRCA2 should be carried in individuals with or without family history ofbreast cancer as these genes have been reported to increase the cancer risk bytenfold.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1143-2 PMID: 29700634
