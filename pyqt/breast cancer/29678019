Stud Health Technol Inform. 2018;247:541-545.Combining the Generic Entity-Attribute-Value Model and Terminological Models intoa Common Ontology to Enable Data Integration and Decision Support.Bouaud J(1), Guézennec G(2), Séroussi B(2).Author information: (1)AP-HP, DRCI, Paris, France.(2)Sorbonne Université, Université Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cité, INSERM, LIMICS,UMR_S 1142, Paris, France.The integration of clinical information models and termino-ontological modelsinto a unique ontological framework is highly desirable for it facilitates dataintegration and management using the same formal mechanisms for both dataconcepts and information model components. This is particularly true forknowledge-based decision support tools that aim to take advantage of all facetsof semantic web technologies in merging ontological reasoning, conceptclassification, and rule-based inferences. We present an ontology template thatcombines generic data model components with (parts of) existingtermino-ontological resources. The approach is developed for the guideline-based decision support module on breast cancer management within the DESIREE Europeanproject. The approach is based on the entity attribute value model and could beextended to other domains.PMID: 29678019  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
