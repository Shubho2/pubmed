Materials and Methods Thisinstitutional study included 222 women at two independent study sites (site 1:training set of 95 patients; mean age ± standard deviation, 58.6 years ± 6.6; 61 malignant and 34 benign lesions; site 2: independent test set of 127 patients;mean age, 58.2 years ± 6.8; 61 malignant and 66 benign lesions). All womenpresented with a finding suspicious for cancer at x-ray mammography (BI-RADS 4 or5) and an indication for biopsy. Before biopsy, diffusion-weighted MR imaging (b values, 0-1500 sec/mm2) was performed by using 1.5-T imagers from different MRimaging vendors. Lesions were segmented and voxel-based kurtosis fitting adapted to account for fat signal contamination was performed. A radiomics feature model was developed by using a random forest regressor. The fixed model was tested onan independent test set. Conventional interpretations of MR imaging were alsoassessed for comparison. Results The radiomics feature model reducedfalse-positive results from 66 to 20 (specificity 70.0% [46 of 66]) at thepredefined sensitivity of greater than 98.0% [60 of 61] in the independent testset, with BI-RADS 4a and 4b lesions benefiting from the analysis (specificity74.0%, [37 of 50]; 60.0% [nine of 15]) and BI-RADS 5 lesions showing no addedbenefit. The model significantly improved specificity compared with the medianapparent diffusion coefficient (P < .001) and apparent kurtosis coefficient (P = .02) alone. Conventional reading of dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imagingprovided sensitivity of 91.8% (56 of 61) and a specificity of 74.2% (49 of 66).Accounting for fat signal intensity during fitting significantly improved thearea under the curve of the model (P = .001). Conclusion A radiomics model based on kurtosis diffusion-weighted imaging performed by using MR imaging machinesfrom different vendors allowed for reliable differentiation between malignant andbenign breast lesions in both a training and an independent test data set. ©RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2017170273 PMID: 29461172  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
