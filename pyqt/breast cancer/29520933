Epub 2018 Mar 8.Evaluating the risk of underlying malignancy in patients with pathologic nippledischarge.Li GZ(1), Wong SM(2)(3), Lester S(4), Nakhlis F(1).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.(2)Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.(3)Department of Surgery, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.(4)Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.Most pathologic nipple discharge (PND) is benign, but duct excision has beenadvised to exclude malignancy. To identify factors associated with malignancy, wereviewed 280 patients with PND at our institution from 2004 to 2014. In 49 cases,malignancy was found. These patients more often had palpable masses (39% vs 11%, P < .001) and abnormal imaging (94% vs 75%, P = .004). On multivariable analysis,age, palpable mass, and abnormal imaging were independently associated withmalignancy. Among 48 patients with PND but no other clinical/imagingabnormalities, only 1 malignancy, a small ductal carcinoma in situ, wasidentified. Observation may be reasonable for these select patients.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13018 PMID: 29520933
