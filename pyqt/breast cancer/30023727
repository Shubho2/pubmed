Epub 2017Aug 17.Potent Anticancer Activity with High Selectivity of a Chiral PalladiumN-Heterocyclic Carbene Complex.Kumar A(1), Naaz A(1), Prakasham AP(1), Gangwar MK(1), Butcher RJ(2), Panda D(1),Ghosh P(1).Author information: (1)Department of Chemistry and Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering,Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Powai, Mumbai 400076, India.(2)Department of Chemistry, Howard University, Washington, DC 20059, UnitedStates.Five enantiomeric pairs of palladium complexes of 1,2,4-triazole-derived chiralN-heterocyclic carbene ligands were investigated to probe the influence ofchirality on the compound's anticancer activity. Although no chirality-relatedinfluence was observed for any of the enantiomeric pair, strong anticanceractivity was seen for a particular pair, (1S,2S,5R)-1c and (1R,2R,5S)-1c, whichwas significantly more active than the benchmark drug cisplatin for human breast cancer cells, MCF-7 (ca. 24-27-fold), and human cervical cancer cells, HeLa (ca. three- to fourfold). Broadening its scope of application, (1R,2R,5S)-1c alsoexhibited antiproliferative activity against lung cancer (A549), skin cancer(B16F10), and multidrug-resistant mammary tumor (EMT6/AR1) cell lines.Interestingly, (1R,2R,5S)-1c displayed 8- and 16-fold stronger antiproliferative activity toward B16F10 and MCF-7 relative to their respective noncancerouscounterparts, L929 (fibroblast skin cells) and MCF10A (epithelial breast cells), thereby upholding the potential of these complexes for further development asanticancer agents. (1R,2R,5S)-1c inhibited tumor-cell proliferation by blockingthe cells at the G2 phase. (1R,2R,5S)-1c caused DNA damage in MCF-7 cells,leading to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and subsequently celldeath. We also present evidence indicating that (1R,2R,5S)-1c inducedp53-dependent programmed cell death in MCF-7 cells.DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00688 PMCID: PMC6044915PMID: 30023727
