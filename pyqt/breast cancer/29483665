Epub2018 Feb 26.The association between cancer family history and ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers: can it be explained by the mutation position?Teixeira N(1), van der Hout A(2), Oosterwijk JC(2), Vos JR(3)(4); HEBON, Devilee P(5), van Engelen K(6), Meijers-Heijboer H(7), van der Luijt RB(8), Kriege M(9), Mensenkamp AR(4), Rookus MA(10), van Roozendaal KE(11), Mourits MJE(12), de Bock GH(3).Author information: (1)Department of Epidemiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University ofGroningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. n.teixeira@umcg.nl.(2)Department of Genetics, University Medical Center Groningen, University ofGroningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.(3)Department of Epidemiology, University Medical Center Groningen, University ofGroningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.(4)Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, RadboudUniversity, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.(5)Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, University of Leiden, Leiden, The Netherlands.(6)Department of Clinical Genetics, VU University Medical Center, VrijeUniversiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.(7)Department of Clinical Genetics, Academic Medical Center, University ofAmsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.(8)Department of Clinical Genetics, University Medical Center Utrecht, Universityof Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.(9)Department of Medical Oncology, Family Cancer Clinic, Erasmus UniversityMedical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.(10)Department of Epidemiology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, TheNetherlands.(11)Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital of Maastricht,University of Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands.(12)Department of Gynecologic Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen,University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.This observational study aimed to investigate whether the reported associationbetween family history (FH) of breast cancer (BC) or ovarian cancer (OC) and OCrisks in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers can be explained by mutation position on thegene. In total, 3310 female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers participating in anationwide prospective cohort (Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer in theNetherlands) were included. FH was classified according to cancer occurrence infirst-degree relatives (BC only, OC only, both, neither) and mutations wereclassified according to their position on the gene (OC cluster region (OCCR), BC cluster region, neither). The main outcome was OC occurrence. Coxproportional-hazard models were applied to investigate the association between FHand OC risks before and after adjusting for mutation position. Of all womenincluded, 202 were diagnosed with OC. A BC-only FH tended to be associated withlower OC risks when compared with a FH without BC/OC (HR: 0.79, 95% CI:0.52-1.17; HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.33-1.07 for BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively) whilean OC-only FH tended to be associated with higher risks (HR: 1.58, 95% CI:0.90-2.77; HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 0.70-4.37 for BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively). After adjusting for mutation position, association between FH and OC risks was slightlysmaller in magnitude (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.55-1.30; HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.34-1.21for BC-only FH in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively; HR: 1.46, 95% CI: 0.80-2.68; HR:1.49, 95% CI: 0.44-4.02 for OC-only FH in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively),indicating that mutation position explains only part of the association.Considering the magnitude of the observed trend, we do not believe FH should beused to change counseling regarding OC prevention.DOI: 10.1038/s41431-018-0111-9 PMCID: PMC5974362 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29483665
