Epub 2018 Apr 12.Synthesis of some novel dimethine, bis-dimethine cyanine dyes and octacosamethinecyanine dyes endowed with promising biological potency against (HepG2), (Hela),(MCF-7), (MIA), (SN12C) and (H358) cell lines.El-Mekawy RE(1), Fadda AA(2).Author information: (1)Department of Petrochemicals, Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute, NasrCity, Cairo, Egypt. Electronic address: rashachemistry1@yahoo.com.(2)Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura,Egypt.Successfully, one step two component synthesis of dimethine cyanine dyes,bis-dimethine cyanine dyes and icosamethine cyanine dyes 2-10via reaction ofpyridinium salt 1 with some different aldehydes hope to obtain these compoundswith enhanced biological potency as antitumor agents against spontaneous liver(HepG2), cervical (Hela), breast (MCF-7), pancreas (MIA), kidney (SN12C) and lung(H358). The impact of substituted drugs on the tumor cells was reflected by meansof structure activity relationship (SAR). Among these dyes, icosamethine cyanine dye 8 recorded an excellent activity toward all the tested cell lines. The newly destined drugs were identified and emphasized by spectroscopy and elementalanalyses.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2018.04.032 PMID: 29673982
