Although mutated in 30-35% of all cases, p53 is mutated in approximately 80% of triple-negative (TN) tumors (i.e., tumors negative for ER, PR, and HER2). Because of this high prevalence, mutated p53 is both a potential biomarker andtherapeutic target for patients with breast cancer, especially for those with theTN subtype. Although several retrospective studies have investigated a potential prognostic and therapy predictive role for mutant p53 in breast cancer, theresults to date are mixed. Thus, at present, mutant p53 cannot be recommended as a prognostic or therapy predictive biomarker in breast cancer. In contrast to themultiple reports on a potential biomarker role, few studies had until recently,investigated mutant p53 as a potential target for breast cancer treatment. In thelast decade, however, several compounds have become available which canreactivate mutant p53 protein and convert it to a conformation with wild-typeproperties. Some of these compounds, especially PRIMA-1, APR-246 PK11007, andCOTI-2, have been found to exhibit anticancer activity in preclinical models ofbreast cancer.CONCLUSION: Since p53 is mutated in the vast majority of TN breast cancers,compounds such as APR-246, PK11007, and COTI-2 are potential treatments forpatients with this subform of the disease. Further research is necessary toidentify a potential biomarker role for mutant p53 in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4753-7 PMID: 29564741
