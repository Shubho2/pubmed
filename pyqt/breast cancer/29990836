Recently, miR-298 is recognized as acancer-associated miRNA in breast, gastric and ovarian cancer. However, thefunctional role of miR-298 and its underlying mechanism are rarely reported inHCC. Herein, we found that the expression of miR-298 was down-regulated in HCCtissues and cell lines. The in vitro experiments showed that miR-298overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced G1 arrest and apoptosis of HCC cells. miR-298 knockdown exerted an oppositeeffect on these cellular behaviors of HCC cells. Moreover, miR-298 restorationsuppressed HCC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Additionally, catenin delta 1(CTNND1) was demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-298 in HCC cells. CTNND1knockdown led to similar effects with miR-298 overexpression on HCC cellproliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and mobility. CTNND1 restorationreversed miR-298-induced inhibitory effects on HCC cells. Mechanistically, bothmiR-298 overexpression and CTNND1 knockdown repressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling andresulted in reduced expression of β-catenin, WNT11, Cyclin D1 and MMP7 in HCCLM3 cells. While, CTNND1 restoration abolished miR-298-induced inactivation ofWnt/β-catenin signaling. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidencethat miR-298 suppresses HCC progression at least partially by targetingCTNND1-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. MiR-298 may be a target for newtherapies in HCC patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.biopha.2018.06.135 PMID: 29990836
