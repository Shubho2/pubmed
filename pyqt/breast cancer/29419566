[Epub ahead ofprint]Risk Factors for Adverse Events in Patients With Breast, Colorectal, and LungCancer.Weingart SN, Atoria CL, Pfister D, Classen D, Killen A, Fortier E, Epstein AS,Anderson C, Lipitz-Snyderman A.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify risk factors associated withmedical errors and iatrogenic injuries during an initial course ofcancer-directed treatment.METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of 400 patients 18 years or olderundergoing an initial course of treatment for breast, colorectal, or lung cancer at a comprehensive cancer center, we abstracted patient, disease, andtreatment-related variables from the electronic medical record. We examinedadverse events (AEs) and preventable AEs by risk factor using the Ï‡ or Fisherexact tests. We estimated the association between risk factors and the relativerisk of an additional AE or preventable AE in multivariable negative binomialregression models with backwards selection (P < 0.1).RESULTS: There were 304 AEs affecting 136 patients (34%) and 97 preventable AEsaffecting 53 patients (13%). In multivariable analyses, AEs were overrepresented in those with lung cancer compared with patients with breast cancer (incidentrate ratio = 1.9, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-3.2). Nonwhite race (1.6,1.0-2.6), Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (2.0, 0.9-4.1), advanced disease (1.7,1.1-2.6), use of each additional class of high-risk nonchemotherapy medication(1.6, 1.3-1.9), and chemotherapy (2.1, 1.3-3.3) were all associated with risk of an additional AE. Preventable AEs were associated with lung cancer (7.4,2.4-23.2), Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (5.5, 1.7-17.9), and high-risknonchemotherapy medications (1.5, 1.2-2.0).CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for AEs among patients with cancer reflected patients' underlying disease, cancer-directed therapy, and high-risk noncancer medications.The association of AEs with ethnicity merits further research. Risk factor modelscould be used prospectively to identify patients with cancer at increased risk ofharm.DOI: 10.1097/PTS.0000000000000474 PMCID: PMC6078829 [Available on 2019-08-06]PMID: 29419566
