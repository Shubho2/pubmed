The knowledge of the effects ofthese common genetic variants in South Asian populations remains limited. Thepresent study aimed to investigate the association between a selected set of SNPsand the clinicopathological profiles in sporadic breast cancer in Sri Lankanwomen.Methods: A total of 350 postmenopausal women with histologically confirmedinvasive breast cancer were genotyped for 58 SNPs located in 36 breast cancerrelated genes. The clinicopathological factors that were investigated includedage of onset, tumor histologic grade, and lymph node involvement, as well asestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Association testing was performed using logisticregression models adjusted for confounding factors.Results: Seven SNPs showed significant associations with clinicopathologicalprofiles in breast cancer. The G allele of BRCA1:rs799917 (p=0.047; β [standarderror; SE]=-1.069 [0.537]) and the G allele of NQO2:rs17136117 (p=0.040, β[SE]=1.901 [0.923]) were found to be associated with age of onset between 50 and 59 years. The C allele of CDH1:rs13689 (odds ratio [OR], 2.121; p=0.033) wasfound to be associated with ER-positive breast cancer. The A allele ofAKT1:rs1130214 (OR, 2.095; p=0.011) and the C allele of NQO2:rs2071002 (OR,1.632; p=0.045) were associated with HER2-positive breast cancer. The C allele ofBRCA2:rs15869 (OR, 1.600; p=0.041) and the C allele of CCND1:rs7177 (OR, 1.555;p=0.041) were associated with high tumor histologic grade.Conclusion: The common genetic variants identified in the AKT1, BRCA1, BRCA2,CCND1, CDH1, and NQO2 genes could serve as potential clinical and prognosticbiomarkers in sporadic breast cancer patients. Further studies are required tovalidate our current findings in other populations.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.165 PMCID: PMC6015979PMID: 29963112
