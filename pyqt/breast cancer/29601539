Chronic inflammation isdocumented to promote tumorigenesis and is a critical component of tumorprogression. Furthermore, inflammation is strongly linked to angiogenesis,immunotolerance, invasiveness, metastasis, and resistance in breast cancers. Inthis review, the literature on the role of connexin hemichannels in inflammation is summarized, and the potential role for hemichannel-mediated inflammation indriving breast cancer progression is discussed. Lastly, the potential forconnexin-based therapeutics to modulate the inflammatory component of the tumormicroenvironment as an avenue for the treatment of breast cancer is alsodiscussed.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19041043 PMCID: PMC5979453PMID: 29601539
