This tumor presents clinically as asolitary lesion with a cystic component located in the subcutaneous layerabutting the skin. On ultrasound, it appears as a circumscribed complex cysticand solid mass abutting the dermis. The occurrence of PH in the breast is veryrare. Its features overlap with intraductal papilloma and papillary carcinoma.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 66-year-old woman presented with a palpable lump in her rightbreast.DIAGNOSES: Clinical examination revealed dark bluish dome-shaped nodule whichpresented as circumscribed round isodense mass on mammography and oval complexcystic and solid mass abutting the dermis on ultrasound. Clinically, a papillary neoplasm was suspected.INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent En bloc surgical excision including theoverlying epidermis and the surrounding adipose tissue to prevent recurrence.OUTCOMES: A well-demarcated, non-encapsulated grayish white mass composed of apartly solid and partly cystic area was completely removed andhistopathologically confirmed as PH. At the 12-month follow-up, no recurrence wasevident.LESSONS: PH should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a slowlygrowing breast mass that is bluish, cystic, and solid and abuts the dermis.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011154 PMCID: PMC6023949PMID: 29924021  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
