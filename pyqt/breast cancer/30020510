[Epub ahead of print]A randomized, open-label, Phase III trial of pertuzumab retreatment inHER2-positive locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients previouslytreated with pertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy: the Japan Breast CancerResearch Group-M05 PRECIOUS study.Yamamoto Y(1), Iwata H(2), Ueno T(3), Taira N(4), Kashiwaba M(5), Takahashi M(6),Tada H(7), Tsugawa K(8), Toyama T(9), Niikura N(10), Hara F(11), Fujisawa T(12), Yoshinami T(13), Saji S(14), Takano T(15), Masuda N(16), Morita S(17), Toi M(18),Ohno S(19).Author information: (1)Department of Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Graduate School of MedicalSciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto.(2)Department of Breast Oncology, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya.(3)Department of Breast Surgery, Kyorin University Hospital, Tokyo.(4)Department of Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Okayama University Hospital,Okayama.(5)Department of Breast Surgery, Breastpia Miyazaki Hospital, Miyazak.(6)Department of Breast Surgery, National Hospital Organization Hokkaido CancerCenter, Sapporo.(7)Department of Breast and Endocrine Surgical Oncology, Graduate School ofMedicine, Tohoku University, Sendai.(8)Division of Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Department of Surgery, St. Marianna University School of Medicine Hospital, Kawasaki.(9)Department of Breast Surgery, Nagoya City University Graduate School ofMedical Sciences, Nagoya.(10)Department of Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Tokai University School ofMedicine, Isehara.(11)Department of Breast Oncology, National Hospital Organization Shikoku Cancer Center, Matsuyama.(12)Department of Breast Oncology, Gunma Prefectural Cancer Center, Ohta.(13)Department of Clinical Oncology, Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka.(14)Department of Medical Oncology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima.(15)Department of Medical Oncology, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo.(16)Department of Surgery, Breast Oncology, National Hospital Organization Osaka National Hospital, Osaka.(17)Department of Biomedical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Graduate School ofMedicine Kyoto University, Kyoto.(18)Graduate School of Medicine Kyoto University, Department of Surgery (BreastSurgery) Kyoto.(19)The Cancer Institute Hospital of JFCR, Breast Oncology Center, Tokyo, Japan.The PRECIOUS study (UMIN000018202) is being conducted as a multicenter,randomized, open-label Phase III study to determine if retreatment withpertuzumab is more effective than conventional treatment in HER2-positive locallyadvanced (LA)/metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients previously treated withpertuzumab, trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Patients are randomized 1:1 intochemotherapy plus trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab groups. The latestregimen before enrollment did not include pertuzumab, and the number of previous chemotherapy regimens for LA/MBC did not exceed three. The primary endpoint isinvestigator-assessed progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints includeindependent reviewer-assessed progression-free survival, progression-freesurvival in patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine as the latest regimen,response rate, response duration, overall survival, safety and health-relatedquality of life. Target accrual is 370 patients, allowing the observation of 325 events, yielding an 80% power for detection of a hazard ratio of 0.739 with aone-sided 5% level of significance.DOI: 10.1093/jjco/hyy097 PMID: 30020510
