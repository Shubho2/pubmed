Golgi, 19,20133, Milan, Italy.(#)Contributed equallyRGD-α-amanitin and isoDGR-α-amanitin conjugates were synthesized by joiningintegrin ligands to α-amanitin via various linkers and spacers. The conjugateswere evaluated for their ability to inhibit biotinylated vitronectin binding tothe purified αVβ3 receptor, retaining good binding affinity, in the samenanomolar range as the free ligands. The antiproliferative activity of theconjugates was evaluated in three cell lines possessing different levels of αVβ3 integrin expression: human glioblastoma U87 (αVβ3+), human lung carcinoma A549(αVβ3-) and breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-468 (αVβ3-). In the U87, in theMDA-MB-468, and partly in the A549 cancer cell lines, thecyclo[DKP-isoDGR]-α-amanitin conjugates bearing the lysosomally cleavable Val-Alalinker were found to be slightly more potent than α-amanitin. Apparently, for allthese α-amanitin conjugates there is no correlation between the cytotoxicity and the expression of αVβ3 integrin. To determine whether the increased cytotoxicity of the cyclo[DKP-isoDGR]-α-amanitin conjugates is governed by anintegrin-mediated binding and internalization process, competition experimentswere carried out in which the conjugates were tested with U87 (αVβ3+, αVβ5+,αVβ6-, α5β1+) and MDA-MB-468 (αVβ3-, αVβ5+, αVβ6+, α5β1-) cells in the presenceof excess cilengitide, with the aim of blocking integrins on the cell surface.Using the MDA-MB-468 cell line, a fivefold increase of the IC50 was observed for the conjugates in the presence of excess cilengitide, which is known to strongly bind not only αVβ3, but also αVβ5, αVβ6, and α5β1. These data indicate that inthis case the cyclo[DKP-isoDGR]-α-amanitin conjugates are possibly internalizedby a process mediated by integrins different from αVβ3 (e.g., αVβ5).DOI: 10.3762/bjoc.14.29 PMCID: PMC5827777PMID: 29520305
