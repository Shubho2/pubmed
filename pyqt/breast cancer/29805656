The aim of the present study was to evaluate theclinical significance of Cav-1 gene expression in association with the expressionof EGFR in patients with breast cancer. Primary breast cancer samples from 306patients were analyzed for Cav-1 and EGFR expression using immunohistochemistry, and clinical significance was assessed using multivariate Cox regressionanalysis, Kaplan-Meier estimator curves and the log-rank test. Stromal Cav-1 was downregulated in 38.56% (118/306) of tumor tissues, whereas cytoplasmic EGFR and Cav-1 were overexpressed in 53.92% (165/306) and 44.12% (135/306) of breastcancer tissues, respectively. EGFR expression was positively associated withcytoplasmic Cav-1 and not associated with stromal Cav-1 expression in breastcancer samples; however, low expression of stromal Cav-1 was negativelyassociated with cytoplasmic Cav-1 expression in total tumor tissues, andanalogous results were identified in the chemotherapy group. Multivariate Cox'sproportional hazards model analysis revealed that, for patients in the estrogenreceptor (ER)(+) group, the expression of stromal Cav-1 alone was a significantprognostic marker of breast cancer. However, in the chemotherapy, human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)(-), HER-2(+) and ER(-) groups, the use ofcombined markers was more effective prognostic marker. Stromal Cav-1 has a tumor suppressor function, and the combined marker stromal Cav-1/EGFR expression wasidentified as an improved prognostic marker in the diagnosis of breast cancer.Parenchymal expression of Cav-1 is able to promote EGFR signaling in breastcancer, potentially being required for EGFR-mediated initiation of mitosis.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8533 PMCID: PMC5958698PMID: 29805656
