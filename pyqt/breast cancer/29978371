The study considered blue, radioisotope active, andsuspiciously palpable nodes as sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs).RESULTS: The SLN identification rate was 87.8%. The median age of the patientswith an SLNB (n = 86) was 44 years (range 28-66 years). Of these patients, 77(88.4%) had cT1-3 disease, and 10 (11.6%) had cT4 disease. The majority of thepatients (n = 66, 76.7%) had cN1, whereas 21 patients (23.3%) had cN2 and cN3. A combined method was used for 37 patients (43%), whereas blue dye alone was usedfor the remaining patients (57%). The clipped node was the SLN in 70 patients(81.4%). For the patients with cN1 before NAC, the FNR was found to be 4.2%(1/24) when the clipped node was identified as an SLN. However, the FNR wasestimated to be as high as 16.7% (1/6) for the patients with cN1 before NAC when the clipped node was found to be a non-SLN.CONCLUSIONS: The study results also suggest that axillary dissection could beomitted for patients presenting initially with N1 disease and with anegative clipped node as the SLN after NAC due to the low FNR.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6575-6 PMID: 29978371
