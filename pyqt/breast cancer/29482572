The regulation of cell cycle is mainly dependent on cyclins andcyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs). Recent studies have shown that CDKs are closely related to the tumor diagnosis, progression and response to treatment.However, their specific biological roles and related mechanism in renal cellcarcinoma (RCC) remain unknown.METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistrywere used to detect the expression of WTAP and CDK2. The survival analysis wasadopted to explore the association between WTAP expression and the prognosis ofRCC. Cells were stably transfected with lentivirus approach and cellproliferation and cell cycle, as well as tumorigenesis in nude mice wereperformed to assess the effect of WTAP in RCC. RNA immunoprecipitation,Luciferase reporter assay and siRNA were employed to identify the direct binding sites of WTAP with CDK2 transcript. Colony formation assay was conducted toconfirm the function of CDK2 in WTAP-induced growth promoting.RESULTS: In RCC cell lines and tissues, WTAP was significantly over-expressed.Compared with patients with low expression of WTAP, patients with high expressionof WTAP had lower overall survival rate. Additionally, cell function testindicated that cell proliferation abilities in WTAP over-expressed group wereenhanced, while WTAP knockdown showed the opposite results. Subcutaneousxenograft tumor model displayed that knockdown of WTAP could impede tumorigenesisin vivo. Mechanism study exhibited that CDK2 expression was positively associatedwith the expression of WTAP. Moreover, WTAP stabilized CDK2 transcript to enhanceCDK2 expression via binding to 3'-UTR of CDK2 transcript. Additionally, specific inhibitors of CDK2 activity and small interfering RNA (siRNA) of CDK2 expression inhibited WTAP-mediated promotion of proliferation.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that WTAP may have an oncogenic role in RCCthrough physically binding to CDK2 transcript and enhancing its transcriptstability which might provide new insights into RCC therapy.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0706-6 PMCID: PMC5827993PMID: 29482572
