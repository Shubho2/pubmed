We evaluated their prognostic relevance by performing a pooled analysis of individual patient data. Patients and Methods Associations between PIK3CA status andclinicopathologic characteristics were tested by applying Cox regression modelsadjusted for age, tumor size, nodes, grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, treatment, and study. Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) was the primary end point; distant disease-freesurvival (DDFS) and overall survival (OS) were also assessed, overall and bybreast cancer subtypes. Results Data from 10,319 patients from 19 studies wereincluded (median OS follow-up, 6.9 years); 1,787 patients (17%) receivedchemotherapy, 4,036 (39%) received endocrine monotherapy, 3,583 (35%) receivedboth, and 913 (9%) received none or their treatment was unknown. PIK3CA mutationsoccurred in 32% of patients, with significant associations with ER positivity,increasing age, lower grade, and smaller size (all P < .001). Prevalence ofPIK3CA mutations was 18%, 22%, and 37% in the ER-negative/HER2-negative,HER2-positive, and ER-positive/HER2-negative subtypes, respectively. Inunivariable analysis, PIK3CA mutations were associated with better IDFS (HR,0.77; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.84; P < .001), with evidence for a stronger effect in thefirst years of follow-up (0 to 5 years: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.81; P < .001;5 to 10 years: HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99; P = .037); > 10 years: (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.58; P = .38; P heterogeneity = .02). In multivariable analysis,PIK3CA genotype remained significant for improved IDFS ( P = .043), but not forthe DDFS and OS end points. Conclusion In this large pooled analysis, PIK3CAmutations were significantly associated with a better IDFS, DDFS, and OS, but hada lesser prognostic effect after adjustment for other prognostic factors.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.74.8301 PMID: 29470143
