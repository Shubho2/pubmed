Among the STAT members, STAT3 plays crucialroles in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. While STAT3activation is transient in physiological conditions, STAT3 becomes persistentlyactivated in a high percentage of solid and hematopoietic malignancies (e.g.,melanoma, multiple myeloma, breast, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers), thuscontributing to malignant transformation and progression. This makes STAT3 anattractive therapeutic target for cancers. Initial strategies aimed at inhibitingSTAT3 functions have focused on blocking the action of its activating kinases or sequestering its DNA binding ability. More recently, the diffusion ofproteomic-based techniques, which have allowed for the identification andcharacterization of novel STAT3-interacting proteins able to modulate STAT3activity via its subcellular localization, interact with upstream kinases, andrecruit transcriptional machinery, has raised the possibility to target suchcofactors to specifically restrain STAT3 oncogenic functions. In this article, wesummarize the available data about the function of STAT3 interactors in malignantcells and discuss their role as potential therapeutic targets for cancertreatment.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19061787 PMCID: PMC6032216PMID: 29914167
