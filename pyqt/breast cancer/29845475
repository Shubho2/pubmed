We studied MALAT1 expression in breast cancer inrelation to disease features and patient survival.METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)was used to measure MALAT1 expression in tumor samples of 509 breast cancerpatients. Hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculatedto assess the association between MALAT1 expression and breast cancer survivalusing the Cox proportional hazards regression model, and the analysis wasadjusted for age at surgery, tumor grade, disease stage, and hormone receptorstatus. Meta-analysis of multiple microarray datasets from online databases andour own study was performed to evaluate the association of MALAT1 with breastcancer survival.RESULTS: Patients with low-grade or ER-positive tumors had higher expression ofMALAT1 compared to those with high-grade (p = 0.013) or ER-negative (p = 0.0002) tumors. Patients with PR-positive tumors also had higher MALAT1 expression thanthose with PR-negative tumors (p < 0.0001). In patients with positive hormonereceptors or low tumor grade, tumors with high MALAT1 expression were more likelyto recur. Survival analysis showed that patients with high expression of MALAT1had a twofold increase in risk of relapse (p = 0.0083) compared to those with lowexpression. This association remained significant after adjustment for age atsurgery, disease stage, tumor grade, and hormone receptor status. Meta-analysisshowed that high MALAT1 expression was associated with poor relapse-free survivalin patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08-1.92).CONCLUSIONS: High expression of lncRNA MALAT1 is associated with breast cancerrelapse and may play a role in tumor progression.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4839-2 PMID: 29845475
