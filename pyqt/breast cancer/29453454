Here we present a chip-based tumor-mimetic platformincorporating a 3D in vitro breast cancer model with a tumor-mimeticmicrovascular network, replicating the pathophysiological architecture of native vascularized breast tumors. The microfluidic platform facilitated formation ofmature, lumenized and flow-aligned endothelium under physiological flowrecapitulating both high and low perfused tumor regions. Metastatic andnon-metastatic breast cancer cells were maintained in long-term 3D co-culturewith stromal fibroblasts in a poly(ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen hydrogel matrixwithin adjoining tissue chambers. The interstitial space between the chambers andendothelium contained pores to mimic the "leaky" vasculature found in vivo andfacilitate cancer cell-endothelial cell communication. Microvascularpattern-dependent flow variations induced concentration gradients within the 3Dtumor mass, leading to morphological tumor heterogeneity. Anti-cancer drugsdisplayed cell type- and flow pattern-dependent effects on cancer cell viability,viable tumor area and associated endothelial cytotoxicity. Overall, the developedmicrofluidic tumor-mimetic platform facilitates investigation ofcancer-stromal-endothelial interactions and highlights the role of a fluidic,tumor-mimetic vascular network on anti-cancer drug delivery and efficacy forimproved translation towards pre-clinical studies.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-21075-9 PMCID: PMC5816595PMID: 29453454
