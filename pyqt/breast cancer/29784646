MUC1 has been considered a possible therapeutic target for thepast 30 years as it is up-regulated, aberrantly glycosylated and its polarizationis lost in many adenocarcinomas. Moreover, MUC1 is expressed by somehaematopoietic cancers, including acute myeloid leukaemia and myeloma. Althoughmultiple clinical trials have been initiated and immune responses have beendocumented, effective clinical benefit worthy of approval for general applicationhas not as yet been achieved. However, this does not appear to have quelled theinterest in MUC1 as a therapeutic target, as shown by the increase in the number of MUC1-based clinical trials initiated in 2017 ( Figure 1). As with alltranslational studies, incorporating new relevant research findings intotherapeutic strategy is difficult. Decisions are made to commit to a specificstrategy based on the information and data available when the trial is initiated.However, the time required for preclinical studies and early trials can renderthe founding concept not always appropriate for proceeding to a larger definitivetrial. Here, we summarize the attempts made, to date, to bring MUC1 into theworld of cancer immunotherapy and discuss how research findings regarding MUC1structure and function together with expanded knowledge of its interactions with the tumour environment and immune effector cells could lead to improvedtherapeutic approaches.ppbiost;46/3/659/BST20170400CF1F1BST-2017-0400CF1Figure 1.Number of MUC1-targetedtrials initiated each year.© 2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BST20170400 PMCID: PMC6008591PMID: 29784646
