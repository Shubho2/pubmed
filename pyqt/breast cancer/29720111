The target of T-DM1(HER2) is present also on cancer-derived exosomes. We hypothesized thatexosome-bound T-DM1 may contribute to the activity of T-DM1.METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from the cell culture medium of HER2-positiveSKBR-3 and EFM-192A breast cancer cells, HER2-positive SNU-216 gastric cancercells, and HER2-negative MCF-7 breast cancer cells by serial centrifugationsincluding two ultracentrifugations, and treated with T-DM1. T-DM1 not bound toexosomes was removed using HER2-coated magnetic beads. Exosome samples wereanalyzed by electron microscopy, flow cytometry and Western blotting. Binding of T-DM1-containing exosomes to cancer cells and T-DM1 internalization wereinvestigated with confocal microscopy. Effects of T-DM1-containg exosomes oncancer cells were investigated with the AlamarBlue cell proliferation assay andthe Caspase-Glo 3/7 caspase activation assay.RESULTS: T-DM1 binds to exosomes derived from HER2-positive cancer cells, but notto exosomes derived from HER2-negative MCF-7 cells. HER2-positive SKBR-3 cellsaccumulated T-DM1 after being treated with T-DM1-containg exosomes, and treatmentof SKBR-3 and EFM-192A cells with T-DM1-containing exosomes resulted in growthinhibition and activation of caspases 3 and/or 7.CONCLUSION: T-DM1 binds to exosomes derived from HER2-positive cancer cells, and T-DM1 may be carried to other cancer cells via exosomes leading to reducedviability of the recipient cells. The results suggest a new mechanism of actionfor T-DM1, mediated by exosomes derived from HER2-positive cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4418-2 PMCID: PMC5930687PMID: 29720111
