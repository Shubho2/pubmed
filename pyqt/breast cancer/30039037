Histopathological analyses were performed for 71 lesions (80.7%) while the remaining were followed up every six months for oneyear. DWI was performed using b-values of 0 and 1000 sec/mm2, and ADC and rADCwere calculated and compared. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve andYouden index were used to evaluate the parameter's optimal threshold anddiagnostic value. Statistical significance was set as p < 0.05.Results: Eighty-eight lesions from a total of 81 patients, aged between 16 and 73(mean age 42 ± 11.3) years were obtained and evaluated. Pathological results of34 (38.6%) out of 71 lesions were malignant and 37 lesions (42%) were benign.Seventeen (19.3%) lesions remained stable at one-year follow-up and were acceptedas benign breast masses. Mean ADC values of benign and malignant lesions were1.584 × 10-3mm2/sec and 0.884 × 10-3mm2/sec (p < 0.05), respectively. Sensitivityand specificity of ADC were 88% and 87%, respectively at a cut-off value of 1.04 × 10-3mm2/sec. Mean rADC was 0.931 for benign lesions and 0.557 for malignantlesions (p < 0.05). Sensitivity and specificity were 82% and 83% at a cut-offvalue of 0.639. No prominent superiority of rADC over ADC is identified in thedifferentiation of breast masses.Conclusion: ADC and rADC values derived from DWI can be equally useful inclinical setting to differentiate benign from malignant breast masses.DOI: 10.5334/jbsr.1258 PMCID: PMC6032404PMID: 30039037
