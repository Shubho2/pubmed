Thus, selectiveinhibition of M2-TAMs is a desirable anti-cancer approach in highly resistanttumor entities such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or breast cancer. We hereexamined whether a peptide that selectively binds to and is internalized by invitro-differentiated murine M2 macrophages as compared to M1 macrophages, termed M2pep, could be used to selectively target TAMs in HCC and breast carcinoma. Weconfirmed selectivity of M2pep for in vitro M2 polarized macrophages. Uponincubation of suspended mixed 4T1 tumor cells with M2pep, high amounts of theTAMs were found to be associated with M2pep, whereas in mixed tumor cellsuspensions from two HCC mouse models, M2pep showed only low-degree binding toTAMs. M2pep also showed low-degree targeting of liver macrophages. This indicatesthat the TAMs in different tumor entities show different targeting of M2pep andthat M2pep is a very promising approach to develop selective M2-TAM-targeting in tumor entities containing M2-TAMs with significant amounts of the so far elusive M2pep receptor(s).DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193015 PMCID: PMC5814016PMID: 29447241  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
