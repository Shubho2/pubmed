In this study, we demonstrate that α-santalol treatment targetsWnt/β-catenin pathway to inhibit migration of cultured breast cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Migration assays, immunoblotting and immunofluorescencewere used to examine the mechanism of action of a-santalol in breast cancercells.RESULTS: Exposure of MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7 cells to α-santalol resulted in asignificant reduction in their migratory potential and wound healing ability. In addition, α-santalol affected the localization of β-catenin from cytosol tonucleus in MDA-MB 231 cells.CONCLUSION: Alpha-santalol inhibited migration of breast cancer cells may bemediated, in part, by targeting Wnt//β-catenin pathway. β-catenin represents animportant target of α-santalol's response for future pre-clinical studies.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12750 PMID: 30061212  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
