Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.Objective: The serum pepsinogen test has limitation in its predictive power as a noninvasive biomarker for gastric cancer screening. We aimed to investigatewhether the combination of TFF3 and pepsinogen could be an effective biomarkerfor the detection of gastric cancer even in the early stages.Methods: In total, 281 patients with early gastric cancer (EGC), who underwentendoscopic submucosal dissection in Korea, and 708 healthy individuals from Japanwere enrolled in the derivation cohort. The validation cohort included 30 Korean patients with EGC and 30 Korean healthy control blood donors. Serum TFF3 levelswere examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results: Using a cutoff of 6.73â€‰ng/mL in the derivation cohort, the sensitivityof the combination of tests for EGC detection was superior (87.5%) to that ofTFF3 (80.4%) or pepsinogen test alone (39.5%). Similarly, in the validationcohort, the sensitivity of TFF3 plus pepsinogen was higher (90.4%) than that ofTFF3 (80.0%) or pepsinogen test alone (33.3%).Conclusion: The combination of serum TFF3 and pepsinogen is a more effectivenoninvasive biomarker for gastric cancer detection compared with pepsinogen orTFF3 alone, even in EGC.
