Mutations of the tumor suppressor protein P53 are associated with more than 50% of humancancers; however, almost 30% of P53 mutations occur rarely and this has raisedquestions about their significance. It therefore appeared of particular interest that we identified a novel mutation in a patient suffering from breast cancer andfulfilling the diagnostic criteria of LFS. In this study, a patient withremarkable family history developed breast cancer and was diagnosed with LFS. By performing next-generation sequencing on the patient and subsequent verification by Sanger sequencing among other family members, a new germ-line P53 replication error, a trinucleotide repeat mutation in the coding region, was identified intwo generations of this Li-Fraumeni family.PMCID: PMC5794730PMID: 29416929
