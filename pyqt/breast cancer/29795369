However, the importance of individual receptors in TNBCand their specific mechanism of action remain to be elucidated, even if recentfindings suggested a specific role of activated-Notch3 in a subset of TNBCs.Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in TNBCs but the use of anti-EGFR agents (including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, TKIs) has not beenapproved for the treatment of these patients, as clinical trials have showndisappointing results. Resistance to EGFR blockers is commonly reported. Here we show that Notch3-specific inhibition increases TNBC sensitivity to theTKI-gefitinib in TNBC-resistant cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate thatNotch3 is able to regulate the activated EGFR membrane localization into lipidrafts microdomains, as Notch3 inhibition, such as rafts depletion, induces theEGFR internalization and its intracellular arrest, without involving receptordegradation. Interestingly, these events are associated with the EGFR tyrosinedephosphorylation at Y1173 residue (but not at Y1068) by the protein tyrosinephosphatase H1 (PTPH1), thus suggesting its possible involvement in the observed Notch3-dependent TNBC sensitivity response to gefitinib. Consistent with thisnotion, a nuclear localization defect of phospho-EGFR is observed after combined blockade of EGFR and Notch3, which results in a decreased TNBC cell survival.Notably, we observed a significant correlation between EGFR and NOTCH3 expressionlevels by in silico gene expression and immunohistochemical analysis of humanTNBC primary samples. Our findings strongly suggest that combined therapies ofTKI-gefitinib with Notch3-specific suppression may be exploited as a drugcombination advantage in TNBC treatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41389-018-0051-9 PMCID: PMC5968025PMID: 29795369
