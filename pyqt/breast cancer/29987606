Naamit.Gerber@nyumc.org.BACKGROUND: Recent data support the use of post-mastectomy radiation therapy(PMRT) in women with one to three positive lymph nodes; however, the benefit ofPMRT in patients with micrometastatic nodal disease (N1mi) is unknown. Weevaluated the survival impact of PMRT in patients with N1mi within the NationalCancer Database.METHODS: The pattern of care and survival benefit of PMRT was examined in womenwith pT1-2N1mi breast cancer who underwent mastectomy without neoadjuvantchemotherapy. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models wereemployed for survival analysis, and subanalyses of high-risk patients and apropensity score-matched (PSM) cohort were completed.RESULTS: From 2004 to 2014, we identified 14,019 patients who fitted the studycriteria. PMRT was delivered in 18.5% of patients and its use increased over the study period. Patients treated with PMRT were younger, had better performancestatus and larger primaries, were estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, had highergrade, lymphovascular invasion and positive surgical margins, and more oftenreceived systemic therapy. PMRT was significantly associated with overallsurvival (OS) in univariable analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75 [0.64-0.89]), butwas not significant in multivariable analysis (adjusted HR 1.01 [0.84-1.20]).There was no survival benefit to PMRT in ER-negative, high-grade, and/or youngpatients. There were 2 (0.9%) death events in the sentinel lymph node biopsy(SLNB) + PMRT group versus 21 (2.9%) in the SLNB-alone group (log-rankp = 0.053), and 8 (3.9%) death events in the axillary lymph node biopsy(ALNB) + PMRT group versus 27 (3.6%) in the axillary lymph node dissection-alone group (p = 0.82). There was no significant association between PMRT and OS withinthe PSM subgroup.CONCLUSION: In this largest reported retrospective study, no OS differences were associated with PMRT, which suggests that PMRT may not benefit every patient withmicroscopic nodal disease.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6632-1 PMID: 29987606
