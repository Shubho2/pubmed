Nevertheless, to be effective, such cancer surrogates mustpreserve the physiological relevance of the in vivo models in order to providerealistic information on drugs' efficacy. To figure out the role of thearchitecture and composition of 3D cancer models on their tumor-mimickingcapability, here we studied the efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX), a well-knownanticancer molecule in two different 3D cancer models: our 3D breast cancermicrotissue (3D-μTP) versus the golden standard represented by spheroid model(sph). Both models were obtained by using cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) and breast cancer cells (MCF-7) as cellular component. Unlike spheroid model, 3D-μTP was engineered in order to induce the production of endogenous extracellularmatrix by CAF. 3D-μTP have been compared to spheroid in mono- (MCF-7 alone) andco-culture (MCF-7/CAF), after the treatment with DOX in order to studycytotoxicity effect, diffusional transport and expression of proteins related to cancer progression. Compared to the spheroid model, 3D-μTP showed higherdiffusion coefficient of DOX and lower cell viability. Also, the expression ofsome tumoral biomarkers related to cell junctions were different in the twomodels.STATEMENTS OF SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer biology has made progress in unravelingthe mechanism of cancer progression, anyway the most of the results are stillobtained by 2D cell cultures or animal models, that do not faithfully copycat thetumor microenvironment. The lack of correlation between preclinical models and invivo organisms negatively influences the clinical efficacy of chemotherapeuticdrugs. Consequently, even if a huge amount of new drugs has been developed in thelast decades, still people are dying because of cancer. Pharmaceutical companies are interested in 3D tumor model as valid alternative in drug screening inpreclinical studies. However, a 3D tumor model that completely mimics tumorheterogeneity is still far to achieve. In our work we compare 3D human breastcancer microtissues and spheroids in terms of response to doxorubicin and drugdiffusion. We believe that our results are interesting because they highlight thepotential role of the proposed tumor model in the attempts to improve efficacytests.Copyright © 2018.
