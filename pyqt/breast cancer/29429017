This study investigated the effects ofaddition of DBT on interval and detected cancers in population-based screening.METHODS: Oslo Tomosynthesis Screening Trial (OTST) was a prospective, independentdouble-reading trial inviting women 50-69 years biennially, comparing full-field digital mammography (FFDM) plus DBT with FFDM alone. Performance indicators andcharacteristics of screen-detected and interval cancers were compared with twoprevious FFDM rounds.RESULTS: 24,301 consenting women underwent FFDM + DBT screening over a 2-yearperiod. Results were compared with 59,877 FFDM examinations during prior rounds. Addition of DBT resulted in a non-significant increase in sensitivity (76.2%,378/496, vs. 80.8%, 227/281, p = 0.151) and a significant increase in specificity(96.4%, 57229/59381 vs. 97.5%, 23427/24020, p < .001). Number of recalls perscreen-detected cancer decreased from 6.7 (2530/378) to 3.6 (820/227) with DBT(p < .001). Cancer detection per 1000 women screened increased (6.3, 378/59877,vs. 9.3, 227/24301, p < .001). Interval cancer rate per 1000 screens forFFDM + DBT remained similar to previous FFDM rounds (2.1, 51/24301 vs. 2.0,118/59877, p = 0.734). Interval cancers post-DBT were comparable to prior rounds but significantly different in size, grade, and node status from cancers detectedonly using DBT. 39.6% (19/48) of interval cancers had positive nodes comparedwith only 3.9% (2/51) of additional DBT-only-detected cancers.CONCLUSIONS: DBT-supplemented screening resulted in significant increases inscreen-detected cancers and specificity. However, no significant change wasobserved in the rate, size, node status, or grade of interval cancers.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01248546.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4705-2 PMID: 29429017
