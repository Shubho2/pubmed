The shifts in the metabolome caused by BC still lack data fromLatin populations of Hispanic origin. In this pilot study, metabolomic andlipidomic approaches were performed to establish a plasma metabolic fingerprintof Colombian Hispanic women with BC. Data from 1H-NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS werecombined and compared. Statistics showed discrimination between breast cancer andhealthy subjects on all analytical platforms. The differentiating metaboliteswere involved in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, amino acid and fatty acidmetabolism. This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplatform approaches inmetabolic/lipid fingerprinting studies to broaden the outlook of possible shifts in metabolism. Our findings propose relevant plasma metabolites that couldcontribute to a better understanding of underlying metabolic shifts driven by BC in women of Colombian Hispanic origin. Particularly, the understanding of theup-regulation of long chain fatty acyl carnitines and the down-regulation ofcyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA). In addition, the mapped metabolic signatures inbreast cancer were similar but not identical to those reported for non-Hispanicwomen, despite racial differences.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0190958 PMCID: PMC5810980PMID: 29438405  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
