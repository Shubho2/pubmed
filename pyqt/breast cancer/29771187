This study aims to identifyrisk factors for thrombus formation in a large population receiving serialechocardiograms (echo) following port placement. Methods A total of 396 femalebreast cancer patients underwent internal jugular vein chest port placementbetween 2007 and 2013 and received echo studies every third month. Catheter tipposition was measured from chest radiography and catheter associated thrombus wasidentified by echo. Results Sixteen out of 396 patients (4%) had catheter-tipthrombus. No patients were symptomatic or prophylactically anticoagulated.Patients with thrombus were significantly younger than those without (46.4 years versus 53.4 years, respectively, p = 0.02) and had higher stage breast cancerwith 75% versus 44.7% having stage III or IV cancer ( p = 0.017). Thrombus wasidentified after a median of 91 days. No significant difference was identified inanatomic ( p = 0.1) or measured ( p = 0.15) tip position, port laterality (p = 0.86), or number of port lumens ( p = 0.65). Conclusions In this largecohort, younger patients and those with more advanced stage breast cancer weremore associated with catheter-tip-related thrombus after port placement.DOI: 10.1177/0268355518774442 PMID: 29771187
