No differences in changesof LVEF or B-type natriuretic peptide were noted between groups. A significantdifference existed between groups in troponin I levels over time, with lowerlevels in the carvedilol group (p = 0.003). Additionally, a lower incidence ofdiastolic dysfunction was noted in the carvedilol group (p = 0.039).A nonsignificant trend toward a less-pronounced increase in LV end-diastolicdiameter during the follow-up was noted in the carvedilol group (44.1 ± 3.64 mmto 45.2 ± 3.2 mm vs. 44.9 ± 3.6 mm to 46.4 ± 4.0 mm; p = 0.057).CONCLUSIONS: In this largest clinical trial of β-blockers for prevention ofcardiotoxicity under contemporary ANT dosage, the authors noted a 13.5% to 14.5% incidence of cardiotoxicity. In this scenario, carvedilol had no impact on theincidence of early onset of LVEF reduction. However, the use of carvedilolresulted in a significant reduction in troponin levels and diastolic dysfunction.(Carvedilol Effect in Preventing Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiotoxicity [CECCY];NCT01724450).Copyright © 2018 American College of Cardiology Foundation.
