Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine, University ofSouthern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.(2)Intelligent Systems Engineering, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana,United States of America.(3)Opto-Knowledge Systems, Inc., Torrance, California, United States of America.Many multicellular systems problems can only be understood by studying how cells move, grow, divide, interact, and die. Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence theirmicroenvironment. The ideal "virtual laboratory" for such multicellular systemssimulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the "stage") and manymechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the "players" upon the stage). PhysiCell-physics-based multicellular simulator-is an open source agent-basedsimulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying manyinteracting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon amulti-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, andmotility "out of the box." The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making itsimple to maintain and deploy across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelizedwith OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells.Simulations up to 105-106 cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations;larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstratePhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry,and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductalcarcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility,chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and theextensibility of PhysiCell with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a"cellular cargo delivery" system, with application to anti-cancer treatments),cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology. PhysiCell is a powerfulmulticellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with newcapabilities and performance improvements. It also represents a significantindependent code base for replicating results from other simulation platforms.The PhysiCell source code, examples, documentation, and support are availableunder the BSD license at http://PhysiCell.MathCancer.org andhttp://PhysiCell.sf.net.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991 PMCID: PMC5841829PMID: 29474446  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
