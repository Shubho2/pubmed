[Epub ahead of print]CDK4/6 Inhibitors in Combination With Hormone Therapy for HR+/HER2- AdvancedBreast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized ControlledTrials.Deng Y(1), Ma G(2), Li W(1), Wang T(3), Zhao Y(1), Wu Q(4).Author information: (1)Cancer Center, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.(2)Department of Thoracic Surgery, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.(3)Lung Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.(4)Lung Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.Electronic address: wuqiang818@126.com.BACKGROUND: This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aimed tocomprehensively assess the efficacy and toxicity of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitors in advanced breast cancer (ABC) with hormone-receptor positive(HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) disease.METHODS: We performed a systematical search using Cochrane Library, PubMed,Embase, and Web of Science up to March 2018. Only phase 2 and 3 randomizedclinical trials assessing the efficacy and toxicity of the combination regimen ofCDK4/6 inhibitors plus hormone therapy compared with hormone therapy alone wereeligible for this meta-analysis. The pooled analyses of relative risk (RR) andhazard ratio were carried out by Stata software.RESULTS: A total of 7 randomized controlled trials including 3854 patients withHR+/HER2- ABC were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled hazard ratio forprogression-free survival was 0.54 (95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.59; P <.001), and the pooled RR for the objective response rate in all intent-to-treatpatients was 1.51 (95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.81; P < .001). The pooled RRs for all grade adverse events (AEs) and grade 3/4 AEs were 1.07 (95% confidenceinterval, 1.03-1.11; P < .001) and 2.81 (95% confidence interval, 2.54-3.11; P < .001), respectively. However, to investigate the influence of CDK4/6 inhibitorson overall survival, sufficient follow-up is still needed.CONCLUSION: CDK4/6 inhibitors plus hormone therapy can significantly prolong the progression-free survival of patients with HR+/HER2- ABC and improve theobjective response rate compared to conventional hormone therapy alone. Thecombined regimen results in a higher risk of AEs, especially grade 3/4 AEs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.04.017 PMID: 29804650
