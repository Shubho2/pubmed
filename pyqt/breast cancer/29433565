Our objective was toexamine the association between common genetic variants in breast cancer related genes and risk of breast cancer in a cohort of Sri Lankan women.METHODS: A case-control study of 350 postmenopausal women with breast cancer and 350 healthy postmenopausal women was conducted. Genotyping using the iPLEX GOLDassay was done for 56 haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in36 breast cancer related genes. Testing for association was done using anadditive genetic model. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using adjusted logistic regression models.RESULTS: Four SNPs [rs3218550 (XRCC2), rs6917 (PHB), rs1801516 (ATM), and rs13689(CDH1)] were significantly associated with risk of breast cancer. The rs3218550 Tallele and rs6917 A allele increased breast cancer risk by 1.5-fold and 1.4-fold,respectively. The CTC haplotype defined by the SNPs rs3218552|rs3218550|rs3218536on chromosome 7 (P = 0.0088) and the CA haplotype defined by the SNPsrs1049620|rs6917 on chromosome 17 (P = 0.0067) were significantly associated withincreased risk of breast cancer. The rs1801516 A allele and the rs13689 C allele decreased breast cancer risk by 0.6-fold and 0.7-fold, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that common genetic polymorphisms in theXRCC2, PHB, CDH1 and ATM genes are associated with risk of breast cancer amongSri Lankan postmenopausal women. The exact biological mechanisms of how thesevariants regulate overall breast cancer risk need further evaluation usingfunctional studies.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4112-4 PMCID: PMC5809862PMID: 29433565
