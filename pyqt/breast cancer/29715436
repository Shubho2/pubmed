We developed an approach toassess HER2 gene amplification status using ddPCR with two sequences of TFF3 asreference probes.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 76 templates of carcinoma DNA were prepared fromformalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Digital PCR assay of the copynumber of HER2 and TFF3 DNA was performed on the samples. The results werecompared to prior fluorescent in-situ hybridation (FISH) assays performed on the same samples.RESULTS: The ddPCR assay had high concordance with the conventionally usedimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH methods. The ddPCR method returned fewerindeterminate results than IHC. Concordance between a ddPCR plus FISH method and IHC plus FISH can rise to 98.7% (75/76) after validation is carried out.CONCLUSION: It's potentially possible to improve the sensitivity and specifity ofHER2 ddPCR assays using reference sequences not co-localized with HER2 onchromosome 17, and combining results from multiple sequences. Adopting anapproach based on ddPCR HER2 assays plus FISH could lead to reduced costs,labour, and time consumption compared to current IHC plus FISH standard, whilenot losing precision.Copyright Â© 2018.
