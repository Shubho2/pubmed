A subset of metaplastic breast cancers showmyoepithelial differentiation and constitute a morphological spectrum withill-defined borders from fibromatosis-like spindle cell carcinoma tomyoepithelial carcinoma. In a series of 34 metaplastic breast cancers withspindle cell and myoepithelial differentiation, we found recurrent geneticaberrations, which set them apart from other metaplastic breast cancers andsuggest a unique pathogenesis. The majority of cases (28 of 34 patients; 82.4%)showed distinct chromosomal loss in the 9p21.3 region, including CDKN2A andCDKN2B. Biallelic loss of the CDKN2A/B region was found in 50% of deleted cases. Expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN2A (p16) was missing inall samples affected by 9p21.3 loss. Other genomic alterations frequentlyoccurring in triple-negative and metaplastic breast cancer were absent or foundin only a minority of cases. Gains of whole chromosome 5 and chromosomal region5p were observed in nine cases, and were associated with recurrences (p < 0.001).In 64.3% of cases, 9p21.3 loss was accompanied by concurrent PIK3CA mutation.Both genomic abnormalities were also detectable in adenomyoepitheliomas (4/12),which are considered to represent the precursor lesion of myoepithelialmetaplastic breast cancer. In adenomyoepithelioma, PIK3CA mutation was present inboth luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells, whereas p16 loss was found only in the latter. We conclude that 9p21.3 (CDKN2A) loss and PIK3CA mutationcharacterize a subgroup of metaplastic breast cancers with myoepithelial andspindle cell differentiation. Myoepithelial cells in adenomyoepithelioma may showidentical aberrations. Copyright © 2018 Pathological Society of Great Britain andIreland.
