The first date of surgical procedure during this period was defined as the index date. Continuous enrollmentduring the 12-month preindex and postindex period was required, and the patientsample was followed for 12 months postindex. Multivariable regression analysiswas used to determine factors associated with having breast reconstruction.RESULTS: Among the 17,502 women undergoing mastectomy during the study period,73% (n = 12,816) had breast reconstruction, with 66% (n = 11,613) havingimmediate and 7% (n = 1203) having delayed reconstruction. Overall reconstructionrates increased during the study period from 69.47% in the third quarter of 2011 to 75.72% in the third quarter of 2014. The most common type of immediatereconstruction involved the use of tissue expanders (with or without implant and autologous reconstruction) (~77%), followed by implant reconstruction (9.67%),autologous reconstruction (10.81%), and other reconstruction (2.52%). Acellulardermal matrix was commonly used with immediate tissue expander and immediateimplant-based reconstruction, and its use increased during the study period.Demographic and treatment-related factors were found to be associated withreconstruction among women undergoing mastectomy.CONCLUSIONS: In this commercial payor setting, most women undergoing mastectomyhad breast reconstruction. Among women undergoing immediate reconstruction,tissue expander use was common. Several factors were shown to be associated with the decision to have breast reconstruction.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001454 PMID: 29781849
