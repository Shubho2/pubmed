Utilizationin the broader population is unknown, as is the role of breast magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI). Understanding factors associated with imaging use is critical toimprovement of adherence to recommendations.METHODS: A random sample of 9835 eligible patients receiving surgery for stages 2and 3 breast cancer from 2006 to 2007 was selected from the National CancerDatabase for primary data collection. Imaging and recurrence data were abstractedfrom patients 90 days after surgery to 5 years after diagnosis. Factorsassociated with lack of imaging were assessed using multivariable repeatedmeasures logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. Patients werecensored for death, bilateral mastectomy, new cancer, and recurrence.RESULTS: Of 9835 patients, 9622, 8702, 8021, and 7457 patients were eligible for imaging at surveillance years 1 through 4 respectively. Annual receipt of breast imaging declined from year 1 (69.5%) to year 4 (61.0%), and breast MRI ratesdecreased from 12.5 to 5.8%. Lack of imaging was associated with age 80 years or older and age younger than 50 years, black race, public or no insurance versusprivate insurance, greater comorbidity, larger node-positive hormonereceptor-negative tumor, excision alone or mastectomy, and no chemotherapy(p < 0.005). Receipt of breast MRI was associated with age younger than 50 years,white race, higher education, private insurance, mastectomy, chemotherapy, careat a teaching/research facility, and MRI 12 months before diagnosis (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Under-utilization of mammography after breast cancer treatment isassociated with sociodemographic and clinical factors, not institutionalcharacteristics. Effective interventions are needed to increase surveillancemammography for at-risk populations. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02171078.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6359-z PMID: 29450753
