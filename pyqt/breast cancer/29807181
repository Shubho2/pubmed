Electronicaddress: luisgorospe@yahoo.com.(2)Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal Radiology, Madrid, Spain.Metastatic vertebral compression fractures pose a significant clinical problem tocancer patients including pain, spinal deformity, and neurologic deficit.Treatment of metastases to the spine is complex and challenging and may requirelocal and systemic therapies. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was adopted totreat spinal metastases since its introduction during the late 1980s. The mainindications for PVP in the treatment of spinal metastases are analgesia andspinal stabilization. Complications of PVP in malignant compression fractures aremore common than in nonmalignant ones. We present 1 case of tumor seeding alongthe needle tract of a breast cancer patient who had undergone PVP.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
