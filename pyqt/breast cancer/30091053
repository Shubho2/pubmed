[Epub ahead ofprint]Lack of effective translational regulation of PLD expression and exosomebiogenesis in triple-negative breast cancer cells.Gomez-Cambronero J(1).Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wright State UniversitySchool of Medicine, 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway, Dayton, OH, 45435, USA.julian.cambronero@wright.edu.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancerthat is difficult to treat since cells lack the three receptors (ES, PR, or HER) that the most effective treatments target. We have used a well-established TNBCcell line (MDA-MB-231) from which we found evidence in support for aphospholipase D (PLD)-mediated tumor growth and metastasis: high levels ofexpression of PLD, as well as the absence of inhibitory miRs (such as miR-203)and 3'-mRNA PARN deadenylase activity in these cells. Such findings are notpresent in a luminal B cell line, MCF-7, and we propose a new miR•PARN•PLD nodethat is not uniform across breast cancer molecular subtypes and as such TNBCcould be pharmacologically targeted differentially. We review the participationof PLD and phosphatidic acid (PA), its enzymatic product, as new "players" inbreast cancer biology, with the aspects of regulation of the tumormicroenvironment, macrophage polarization, regulation of PLD transcripts byspecific miRs and deadenylases, and PLD-regulated exosome biogenesis. A newsignaling miR•PARN•PLD node could serve as new biomarkers for TNBC abnormalsignaling and metastatic disease staging, potentially before metastases are able to be visualized using conventional imaging.DOI: 10.1007/s10555-018-9753-x PMID: 30091053
