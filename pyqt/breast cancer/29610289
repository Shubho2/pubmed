Precision medicine approaches that exploit this characteristic arenot available. Using perturbation screens in breast tumor cells withCRISPR/Cas9-engineered CDH1 mutations, we identified synthetic lethality between E-cadherin deficiency and inhibition of the tyrosine kinase ROS1. Data fromlarge-scale genetic screens in molecularly diverse breast tumor cell linesestablished that the E-cadherin/ROS1 synthetic lethality was not only robust inthe face of considerable molecular heterogeneity but was also elicited withclinical ROS1 inhibitors, including foretinib and crizotinib. ROS1 inhibitorsinduced mitotic abnormalities and multinucleation in E-cadherin-defective cells, phenotypes associated with a defect in cytokinesis and aberrant p120 cateninphosphorylation and localization. In vivo, ROS1 inhibitors produced profoundantitumor effects in multiple models of E-cadherin-defective breast cancer. Thesedata therefore provide the preclinical rationale for assessing ROS1 inhibitors,such as the licensed drug crizotinib, in appropriately stratifiedpatients.Significance: E-cadherin defects are common in breast cancer but arecurrently not targeted with a precision medicine approach. Our preclinical dataindicate that licensed ROS1 inhibitors, including crizotinib, should berepurposed to target E-cadherin-defective breast cancers, thus providing therationale for the assessment of these agents in molecularly stratified phase IIclinical trials.
