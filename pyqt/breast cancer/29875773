PCNAis overexpressed in many cancer types, and PCNA overexpression is correlated withcancer virulence. Membrane-associated PCNA is a ligand for the NKp44 (NCR2)innate immune receptor. The purpose of this study was to characterize thePCNA-binding site within NKp44. We have identified NKp44-derived linear peptide(pep8), which can specifically interact with PCNA and partly block the NKp44-PCNAinteraction. We then tested whether NKp44-derived pep8 (NKp44-pep8) fused tocell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can be employed for targeting the intracellular PCNA for the purpose of anticancer therapy. Treatment of tumor cells withNKp44-pep8, fused to R11-NLS cell-penetrating peptide (R11-NLS-pep8), reducedcell viability and promoted cell death, in various murine and human cancer celllines. Administration of R11-NLS-pep8 to tumor-bearing mice suppressed tumorgrowth in the 4T1 breast cancer and the B16 melanoma in vivo models. We thereforeidentified the NKp44 binding site to PCNA and further developed anNKp44-peptide-based agent that can inhibit tumor growth through interfering with the function of intracellular PCNA in the tumor cell.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01114 PMCID: PMC5974751PMID: 29875773
