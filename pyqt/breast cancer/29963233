The latest and most efficient CDK4/6inhibitors target the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressorgene; thus, altering levels of many cell cycle molecules. Estrogen receptor(ER)+/HER2- breast cancers have shown great progression free survival when CDK4/6inhibitors are combined with endocrine therapies. Here we report the mechanism ofantiestrogen (fulvestrant) combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors is due to synergismin the suppression of ER-mediated cell cycle progression. Furthermore, weperformed single cell analysis of cells from an estrogen dependent/hormonereceptor-positive patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumor model treated withpalbociclib. These single cells expressed various levels of ER and RB which areinvolved in cell cycle regulation; and the response to palbociclib treatmentrelies not only on the ER-cyclin D1-CDK4/6-RB pathway but it is also dependent onelevated levels of ER and/or RB. Our preclinical studies show that palbociclibresponse is dependent on cells with ER, which is directly involved in cell cycle progression in hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25552 PMCID: PMC6021239PMID: 29963233
