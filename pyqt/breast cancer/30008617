However, its role intriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), especially its correlation with patients'prognosis and chemoresistance remains unclear.Methods: The expression of B7-H4 in TNBC tissues and cell lines were measuredwith Real-Time PCR and western blotting. 65 cases of TNBC tissue samples andadjacent non-tumor tissue samples were analyzed by immunochemistry to demonstratethe correlation between the B7-H4 expression and clinicopathologicalcharacteristics. In vitro studies assessed mAb MIH43 alone and in combinationwith transfecting B7-H4 siRNA on the growth of chemosensitive and chemoresistant TNBC cell lines by CCK-8 and apoptotic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Results: B7-H4 expression was detected positive in 59 of 65 (90.8%) differentstage TNBC patients, especially in the samples of recurrence TNBC patients after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Survival curves showed thatpatients with B7-H4 overexpression had significantly shorter survival andrecurrence time than those with low B7-H4 expression (p < 0.005). Univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis demonstrated that B7-H4 was an independentpredictor for advanced tumor stage. The monoclonal antibody of B7-H4 has thepotential anti-proliferative effects on inhibiting the chemoresistant TNBC celllines and increasing the sensitivity of TNBC cell lines to doxorubicin,paclitaxel or carboplatin. RNAi-mediated silencing of B7-H4 in TNBC cellsenhanced drug-induced apoptosis via inhibiting PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, whereasreexpression of B7-H4 in B7-H4 knockdown and low B7-H4 expressing cells increasedthe phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT along with restoration of PETN expression.Conclusions: Our data show that B7-H4 is a biomarker indicative of a poorprognosis in TNBC patients and at least partially downregulated inchemoresistance via PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway. Targeting B7-H4 might provide anattractive therapeutic approach specifically for TNBC patients.DOI: 10.1186/s12935-018-0597-9 PMCID: PMC6044050PMID: 30008617
