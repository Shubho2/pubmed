[Epub ahead of print]Peripherally restricted cannabinoid 1 receptor agonist as a novel analgesic incancer-induced bone pain.Zhang H(1), Lund DM(1), Ciccone HA(1), Staatz WD(1), Ibrahim MM(1)(2),Largent-Milnes TM(1), Seltzman HH(3), Spigelman I(4), Vanderah TW(1).Author information: (1)Departments of Pharmacology and.(2)Anesthesiology, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, UnitedStates.(3)Center for Drug Discovery, Research Triangle Institute, Research TrianglePark, NC, United States.(4)Division of Oral Biology & Medicine, School of Dentistry, University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Many malignant cancers, including breast cancer, have a propensity to invadebones, leading to excruciating bone pain. Opioids are the primary analgesics usedto alleviate this cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) but are associated withnumerous severe side effects, including enhanced bone degradation, whichsignificantly impairs patients' quality of life. By contrast, agonists activatingonly peripheral CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) have been shown to effectively alleviatemultiple chronic pain conditions with limited side effects, yet no studies haveevaluated their role(s) in CIBP. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that aperipherally selective CB1R agonist can effectively suppress CIBP. Our studiesusing a syngeneic murine model of CIBP show that both acute and sustainedadministration of a peripherally restricted CB1R agonist,4-{2-[-(1E)-1[(4-propylnaphthalen-1-yl)methylidene]-1H-inden-3-yl]ethyl}morpholine (PrNMI), significantly alleviated spontaneous pain behaviors in the animals.This analgesic effect by PrNMI can be reversed by a systemic administration butnot spinal injection of SR141716, a selective CB1R antagonist. In addition, thecancer-induced bone loss in the animals was not exacerbated by a repeatedadministration of PrNMI. Furthermore, catalepsy and hypothermia, the common side effects induced by cannabinoids, were measured at the supratherapeutic doses ofPrNMI tested. PrNMI induced mild sedation, yet no anxiety or a decrease in limbmovements was detected. Overall, our studies demonstrate that CIBP can beeffectively managed by using a peripherally restricted CB1R agonist, PrNMI,without inducing dose-limiting central side effects. Thus, targeting peripheralCB1Rs could be an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CIBP.DOI: 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001278 PMID: 29781960
