In thisstudy, we showed that estrogen homeostasis profile was disturbed in both breastcancer patients and in experimental breast cancer model rats, with carcinogeniccatechol estrogens significantly accumulated in the mammary tissues.UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A8 (UGT1A8) is an important phase IIdrug-metabolizing enzymes which involved in the metabolism of catechol estrogens.Here we found that the mammary nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)- UGT1A8 signaling was down-regulated in breast cancer rats, whereas treatmentwith resveratrol could upregulate the expression of NRF2 and UGT1A8, acceleratemetabolic elimination of catechol estrogens, inhibit estrogen-induced DNA damage and suppress the pathological development of breast cancer. In addition,luciferase reporter assay suggested that resveratrol activated the expression of UGT1A8 by up-regulating the transcriptional activity of NRF2. Small-interferingRNA-mediated silencing of NRF2 abolished resveratrol-mediated preventive effects indicated that the antitumor effect of resveratrol is based onNRF2-UGT1A8-estrogen metabolism axis. Taken together, we established theresveratrol regulating potential on estrogen homeostasis based on NRF2-UGT1A8signaling pathway, and also provided a novel link between estrogenglucuronidation metabolism and breast cancer pathological development.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
