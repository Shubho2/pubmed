Transfection outcomes can be improved through spatially andtemporally controlled gene release. We formulated a nanoassembly comprising adisulfide-crosslinked polyethylenimine (ssPEI) conjugated with a tumor-specificcell-penetrating peptide (DS 4-3) (SPD) polyplex and bovine serum albumin(BSA)-loaded IR780 (BI) nanoparticle, thereby forming a dual-stimulus-triggered, tumor-penetrating and gene-carrying nanoassembly (BI-SPD) via electrostaticcomplexing. BI-SPD nanoassembly were composed of highly stable nanosizedcomplexes with an average size of 457 ± 27.5 nm, exhibiting an up to two-foldenhanced transfection efficiency with no sign of potential cytotoxicity in breastcancer cells. Moreover, upon laser irradiation, a four-fold increase intransfection efficiency was achieved due to the rapid endosomal escape ofpolyplexes triggered by the local heat induced by the BI-SPD nanoassembly.Additionally, the high redox environment in tumor cells facilitated thedisassembly of the SPD polyplex for efficient plasmid release in the cytosol. TheBI-SPD nanoassembly also exhibited high penetration and enhanced photothermallytriggered gene expression in the 4T1 spheroid model. This BI-SPD nanoassembly hasthe potential to enhance the expression of therapeutic genes in tumor modelswithout causing significant toxicity to surrounding healthy tissues, since it hasshown higher tumor targeting and accumulation in the 4T1 tumor in mice model.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
