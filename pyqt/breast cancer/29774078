Here, a novel nanoplatform (HPMC NPs) assembled from hyaluronic acid (HA)-paclitaxel (PTX) prodrug and marimastat (MATT)/β-casein (CN) complexes was established to cure a 4T1 metastatic cancermodel via targeting CD44 and intracellular, rather than extracellular, MMPs.Methods: HPMC NPs were prepared by assembling the complexes and prodrug underultrasonic treatment, which the interaction between them was evaluated by försterresonance energy transfer, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra. Thedeveloped nanoplatform was characterized via dynamic light scattering andtransmission electron microscopy, and was evaluated in terms of MMP-sensitiverelease and stability. Subsequently, the cellular uptake, trafficking, and invitro invasion were studied by flow cytometry, confocal laser microscopy andtranswell assay. MMP expression and activity was determined by western blottingand gelatin zymography. Finally, the studies of biodistribution and antitumorefficacy in vivo were performed in a mouse 4T1 tumor breast model, followed by invivo safety study in normal mouse. Results: The interaction between the prodrugand complexes is strong with a high affinity, resulting in the assembly of these two components into hybrid nanoparticles (250 nm). Compared with extracellularincubation with MATT, HPMC NP treatment markedly reduced the expression (100%)and activity (50%) of MMPs in 4T1 cells and in the tumor. HPMC NPs exhibited1.4-fold tumor accumulation, inhibited tumor-growth by >8-fold in volume withefficient apoptosis and proliferation, and suppressed metastasis (>5-fold) andangiogenesis (>3-fold). Overall, HPMC NPs were efficient in metastatic cancertherapy. Conclusions: According to the assembly of polymer prodrug andprotein-drug complexes, this study offers a new strategy for constructingnanoparticles for targeted drug delivery, biomedical imaging, and combinatorialtreatment. Importantly, via inhibition of intracellular MMPs, metastasis andangiogenesis can be potently blocked, benefiting the rational design ofnanomedicine for cancer treatment.DOI: 10.7150/thno.23209 PMCID: PMC5957012PMID: 29774078
