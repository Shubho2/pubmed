The purpose of this study was to investigate theaccuracy of post-chemotherapy biological markers for predicting the recovery ofovarian function in breast cancer patients of the ASTRRA trial, withchemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea. Using data of 82 participants from a singleinstitution in the ASTRRA trial, the post-chemotherapy serum levels of theanti-müllerian hormone (AMH), estradiol, inhibin B, and other clinical factorsassociated with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea were evaluated. Recovery ofovarian function was defined by the resumption of menstruation manifested byvaginal bleeding. Fifty-two patients regained menstruation within 55 months afterenrolment. In univariate analysis, <40 years of age (p=0.009), estradiol ≥37pg/mL (p=0.003), or AMH ≥800 pg/mL (p=0.026) were associated with recovery ofmenstruation. On multivariate analysis, estradiol (hazard ratio: 3.171, 95% CI:1.306-7.699, p=0.011) and AMH (hazard ratio: 2.853, 95% CI: 1.011-8.046, p=0.048)remained as significant independent predictors for resumption of menstruation.The diagnostic accuracy of age, estradiol, and AMH in predicting the resumptionof menstruation was 38.3%, 23.3%, and 86.7%, respectively. In conclusion,post-chemotherapy AMH level might be a relatively accurate predictor of therecovery of ovarian function, presented by resumption of menstruation in breastcancer patients with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea.DOI: 10.1530/EC-18-0180 PMID: 30012648
