Even under multidisciplinary treatment, 25-50% of patients with breastcancer still ultimately develop metastasis, leading to poor prognosis. Inaddition to inducing angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is believed to directly increase cancer cell metastatic potential andoverexpression of VEGF-A is associated with higher invasiveness of breast cancer.1α,25(OH)2D3, the active form of vitamin D, and its analogs have been widelyapplied as anticancer agents in the past.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Western blot, migration and invasion assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunofluorescent stain were applied in this study.RESULT: VEGF-A increased cell migration and invasion in estrogenreceptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer MCF-7 cells. VEGF-A induced an autocrineloop in MCF-7 cells as VEGF-A treatment increased both VEGF-A expression andsecretion. The expression of VEGF receptor type 2 (VEGFR2) and neuropilin 1 wasalso up-regulated by VEGF-A in MCF-7 cells. In addition, F-actin synthesis andLIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK-1) phosphorylation were increased by VEGF-A. VEGF-Aalso increased β-catenin expression and nuclear translocation of both β-cateninand nuclear factor-ĸB (NF-ĸB), indicating increased β-catenin and NF-ĸB activity.1α,25(OH)2D3 and MART-10, an analog of 1α,25(OH)2D3, effectively repressedVEGF-A-induced MCF-7 cell migration and invasion and other VEGF-A-induced effectson MCF-7 cells, with MART-10 being more potent than 1α,25(OH)2D3 Conclusion:MART-10 can be deemed as a promising agent for prevention and treatment ofmetastasis of ER+ breast cancer with VEGF-A overexpression.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12672 PMID: 29970508  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
