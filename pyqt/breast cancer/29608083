R. Canzona et al. (see record2018-12809-003) on the topic of initiating sexual health conversations withbreast cancer survivors. In this qualitative study, four themes that the authors describe as limiting the ability of clinicians to address issues of sexuality in breast cancer survivors emerge. This study demonstrates that barriers toinitiating conversations about sexual health have a lot more to do with theassumptions, attitudes, and knowledge of the clinicians' and their view of whatis best for patient care than with the patient herself.
