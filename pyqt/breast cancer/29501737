The major problemreported with raloxifene is its poor bioavailability which is only up to 2%. The main objective of the present work was to formulate raloxifene loaded ethosomalpreparation for transdermal application and compare it with an oral formulationof the drug. Five ethosomal formulations with different concentrations of ethanoland a conventional liposomes formulation were prepared by rotary evaporationmethod. The prepared systems were characterised by high resolution transmissionelectron microscopy (HRTEM), force emission electron microscopy (FESEM), atomicforce microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 31P NMR study. All theseadvanced characterization study established that the ethosome formulation waswell defined by its size, shape and its bilayer formation. Transdermal flux ofthe optimized ethosome formulation was 22.14 ± 0.83 µg/ml/cm2 which was 21 times higher when compared to the conventional liposomes. Confocal microscopy studyrevealed an enhanced permeation of coumarin-6 dye loaded ethosomes to much deeperlayers of skin when compared with conventional liposomes. The gel was found to bepseudoplastic with elastic behaviour. In-vivo studies on rats showed a higherbioavailability of RXL (157% times) for ethosomal formulation when compared with the oral formulation. In conclusion, RXL loaded ethosomal formulation viatransdermal route showed superior drug delivery properties as compared to oralformulation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
