However,while monovalent inhibition of BRD4 by BET BrD inhibitors such as JQ1 blocksgrowth of hematopoietic cancers, it is much less effective generally in solidtumors. Here, we report a thienodiazepine-based bivalent BrD inhibitor, MS645,that affords spatially constrained tandem BrD inhibition and consequentlysustained repression of BRD4 transcriptional activity in blocking proliferationof solid-tumor cells including a panel of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)cells. MS645 blocks BRD4 binding to transcription enhancer/mediator proteins MED1and YY1 with potency superior to monovalent BET inhibitors, resulting indown-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and genes for cell-cycle control andDNA damage repair that are largely unaffected by monovalent BrD inhibition. Ourstudy suggests a therapeutic strategy to maximally control BRD4 activity forrapid growth of solid-tumor TNBC cells.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1720000115 PMCID: PMC6077712 [Available on 2019-01-31]PMID: 30012592
