These long transcripts playsignificant roles in diverse cellular processes, mostly through epigeneticmechanisms. Thus, dysregulation of lncRNAs is associated with various diseases,especially cancer. This study aims to investigate the probable roles of RAB6C-AS1lncRNA in different cancers.METHODS: Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionwas applied for the analysis of RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA amplification in gastric cancer (GC) samples compared with normal ones. Also, several online and offline datasets and tools were used to analyze the relation between RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA anddifferent cancers.RESULTS: The end result of our analyses indicated that RAB6C-AS1 wasoverexpressed in 40% of the investigated GC specimens. Also, the resultsdemonstrated a true relation between RAB6C-AS1 overexpression and higher GC tumorgrades. However, bioinformatic analyses showed that while RAB6C-AS1 possiblyfunctions as an oncogene in some cancer types, including prostate and breastcancers, it might have a tumor suppressive function in some others includingbrain tumors.CONCLUSIONS: We found that RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA is mostly overexpressed in GC. Also, based on bioinformatic and systems biology analyses, RAB6C-AS1 might functioneither as an oncogenic factor or tumor suppressor in a tissue-specific manner.Thus, RAB6C-AS1 could be considered as a candidate biomarker for variousmalignancies, especially prostate and brain cancers. According to our results,RAB6C-AS1 has a notable prognostic value for patients with brain lower gradeglioma.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26910 PMID: 30076712
