Dynamic contrast-enhancedimages were acquired at baseline (pre-NAC) and interim (post three NAC cycles)time points. Functional tumour volumes (FTVs), automatically derived using vendorsoftware and enhancing tumour volumes (ETVs), user-derived using a semi-automatedthresholding technique, were calculated at each time point and percentage changescalculated. Response, assessed using residual cancer burden (RCB) score onsurgically resected specimens, was compared statistically with volumetric changesand receiver operating characteristic analysis performed.RESULTS: Mean volumetric differences for each RCB response category were(FTV/ETV): pathological complete response (pCR) 95.5/96.8%, RCB-I 69.8/66.7%,RCB-II 64.0/65.5%, RCB-III 25.4/24.0%. Differences were significant between pCRand RCB-II/RCB-III categories (p < 0.040; unpaired t-test) using FTV measures andbetween pCR and RCB-I/RCB-II/RCB-III categories (p < 0.006; unpaired t-test) whenETV was used. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for pCR identificationpost-NAC yielded area under the curve for FTV/ETV of 0.834/0.920 respectively.Sensitivity and specificity for FTV was 80.0 and 76.8% for FTV and 81.0 and 91.8%for ETV.CONCLUSION: ETV changes can identify patients likely to achieve a completeresponse to NAC. Potentially, this could impact patient management regarding the possible avoidance of post-NAC surgery. Advances in Knowledge: Interim changes inETV are more useful than FTV in predicting final pathological response to NAC.ETV differentiates patients who will achieve a complete response from those whowill have residual disease.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20180123 PMID: 29641224  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
