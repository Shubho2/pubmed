The aim of this study was to identify and assess prognostic lncRNAsignature to predict recurrence among ER-positive BC patients treated withtamoxifen. Cohorts from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (n = 298) and The CancerGenome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 160) were defined as training and validation cohort,respectively. BC relapse associated lnRNAs was identify within training cohort,and the predictable value of recurrence was assessed in both cohorts. A total of 11lncRNAs were recognized to be associated with relapse free survival (RFS) ofER-positive BC patients receiving tamoxifen, who were divided into low-risk andhigh-risk group on basis of relapse risk scores (RRS). Multivariate coxregression analyses revealed that the RRS is an independent prognostic biomarker in the prediction of ER-positive BC patients' survival. GSEA indicated thathigh-risk group was associated with several signaling pathways in processing ofBC recurrence and metastasis such as PI3K-Akt and Wnt signaling. Our 11-lncRNAbased classifier is a reliable prognostic and predictive tool for disease relapsein BC patients receiving tamoxifen.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-21581-w PMCID: PMC5816619PMID: 29453409
