It is a heterogeneous and complex genetic disease with different molecularcharacteristics. MAPT-AS1, a long non-coding RNA(lncRNA) existing at theanti-sense strand of MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau) promoter region,was believed to regulate MAPT which was associated with disease state inParkinson's disease. But the role of MAPT-AS1 in breast cancer has never beenreported. In our study we found that MAPT-AS1 is overexpressed in breast cancerbut not in triple negative breast cancer(TNBC), and high expression of MAPT-AS1was correlated with better patient survival. In addition, the level of MAPT-AS1was correlated with expression of MAPT and MAPT was associated with survival timein breast cancer. Our study suggests that MAPT-AS1 may play a role and be apotential survival predictive biomarker in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1139/bcb-2018-0039 PMID: 30074401
