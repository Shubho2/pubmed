In data from breast, lung and colon cancer, patients with the highest SUVmax showmore genomic anomalies compared to those with the lowest SUVmax (P < 0.005).Conclusions: A higher SUVmax on 18F-FDG PET/CT is associated with TP53 tumorsuppressor gene anomalies and the presence of more genomic anomalies. Since TP53 alterations and high SUVmax both correlate with a poor prognosis, the underlying mechanism/implications of this association merit further study.Methods: Overall, 176 patients with diverse cancers had a tumor biopsy within 6months after a PET/CT image for SUVmax measurement. The biopsy was interrogatedby next generation sequencing (182 to 315 genes). TP53, EGFR, ALK, MYC, MET andFGF/FGFR genes and DNA repair, PI3K/Akt/mTOR (PAM), MEK, CYCLIN, and WNT pathway genes were analyzed.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24508 PMCID: PMC5865671PMID: 29581845
