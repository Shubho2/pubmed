Induction of EMT is a key step for transition from a benign state to ametastatic tumour. Adipose tissue forms a bulk portion of the breast cancermicroenvironment, emerging evidence indicates the potential for adipocytes toinfluence tumour progression through the secretion of adipokines that can induce EMT. The molecular mechanisms underlying how adipocytes enhance breast cancerprogression is largely unknown. We hypothesized that paracrine signalling byadipocytes can activate EMT and results in increased migration and invasioncharacteristics of breast cancer cells. We found that IL-6 secreted by adipocytesinduce EMT in breast cancer cells. The effect of IL-6 expression on EMT ismediated through activation of the signal transducer and activated oftranscription 3 (STAT3). Blocking of IL-6 signalling in breast cancer cells andadipocytes, decreased proliferation, migration and invasion capabilities andaltered the expression of genes regulating EMT. Together, our results suggestthat matured human adipocytes can enhance the aggressive behaviour of breastcancer cells and induce an EMT-phenotype through paracrine IL-6/STAT3 signalling.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27184-9 PMCID: PMC5995871PMID: 29891854
