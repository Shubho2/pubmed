FDG-PET/CT was performedwithin one month before treatment and repeated after at least 3 cycles oftreatment. Metabolic response evaluation was evaluated by two readers accordingto both EORTC criteria and PERCIST, classifying the patients into 4 responsegroups: complete metabolic response (CMR), partial metabolic response (PMR),stable metabolic disease (SMD), and progressive metabolic disease (PMD).RESULTS: With EORTC criteria, 22 patients had CMR, 17 PMR, 6 SMD and 12 PMD. WithPERCIST, 20 patients had CMR, 15 PMR, 10 SMD and 12 PMD. There was agreementbetween EORTC and PERCIST in 84% of the patients. By log-rank analysis, metabolicresponse evaluated with both EORTC criteria and PERCIST was able to predictoverall survival (p = 0.028 and 0.002 respectively). CMR patient group had longermedian OS than patients in the combined PMR+SMD+PMD group (60 vs 26 months bothwith EORTC and PERCIST; p = 0.009 and 0.006 respectively). By multivariateanalysis, CMR either with EORTC or PERCIST remained an independent predictor ofsurvival.CONCLUSION: Metabolic response evaluation with EORTC criteria and PERCIST gavesimilar prognostic stratification for metastatic breast cancer treated with afirst line of systemic therapy.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199529 PMCID: PMC6047783PMID: 30011328
