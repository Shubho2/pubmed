ILC differs from IDC in a number of histological and clinical features, such as single strand growth, difficulty in detection, and frequent late recurrences. To understand themolecular pathways involved in the clinical characteristics of ILC, we comparedthe gene expression profiles of luminal A ILC and luminal A IDC using data fromTCGA and utilized samples from METABRIC as a validation data set. Top pathwaysthat were significantly enriched in ILC were related to immune response. ILCexhibited a higher activity of almost all types of immune cells based on celltype-specific signatures compared to IDC. Conversely, pathways that were lessenriched in ILC were related to protein translation and metabolism, which wefunctionally validated in cell lines. The higher immune activity uncovered in ourstudy highlights the currently unexplored potential of a response toimmunotherapy in a subset of patients with ILC. Furthermore, the lower rates ofprotein translation and metabolism - known features of tumor dormancy - may play a role in the late recurrences of ILC and lower detection rate in mammography andPET scanning.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25357-0 PMCID: PMC5940770PMID: 29739984
