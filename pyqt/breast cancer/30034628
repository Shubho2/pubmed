However, not all MMPs, or even all activities of specificMMPs, promote cancer. Therefore, there is a need for highly specific inhibitors. Monoclonal antibodies provide the potential for the degree of specificityrequired, but the isolation of antibodies able to inhibit a specific proteasewith high selectivity is challenging. Proteolysis specificity lies in recognitionof the substrate in or around the active site, which generally forms a concavecleft inaccessible by human IgGs. Inspired by camelid antibodies, which haveconvex paratopes, we have produced a recombinant human IgG, designated 3A2, whichbinds in the substrate cleft of MMP-14, inhibiting its activity, but not theactivity of highly homologous MMPs. In the 4T1 highly metastatic, syngeneic,orthotopic model of breast cancer, IgG 3A2 markedly inhibited growth of theprimary tumor, but more importantly reduced metastatic spread to the lungs andliver by 94%. Stem cells in the tumor population expressed twice as much MMP-14mRNA as bulk tumor cells. In addition to reducing dissemination of tumor stemcells, as would be expected from inhibition of MMP-14's ability to degradecomponents of the extracellular matrix, IgG 3A2 also inhibited the ability ofindividual stem cells to proliferate and produce colonies. We conclude that it ispossible to produce antibodies with sufficient specificity for development astherapeutics and that IgG 3A2 has therapeutic potential.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25654 PMCID: PMC6047671PMID: 30034628
