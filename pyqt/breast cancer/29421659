Recently, RIP2 has been linked to chemoresistance of triple negativebreast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive breast cancer subtype for which thereis an urgent need for targeted therapies. In this study we show that highexpression of RIP2 in breast tumors correlates with a worse prognosis and ahigher risk of recurrence. We also demonstrate that RIP2 confers TNBC cellresistance against paclitaxel and ceramide-induced apoptosis. Overexpression ofRIP2 lead to NF-κB activation, which contributed to higher expression ofpro-survival proteins and cell survival. Conversely, RIP2 knockdown inhibitedNF-κB signaling, reduced levels of anti-apoptotic proteins and sensitized cellsto drug treatment. Together, these data show that RIP2 promotes survival ofbreast cancer cells through NF-κB activation and that targeting RIP2 may betherapeutically beneficial for treatment of TNBC.Copyright © 2018.
