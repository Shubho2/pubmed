BC survivors' symptoms were reproduced by ULNT1 and exhibitedgreater myoelectric activity in the biceps brachii than healthy women (MD (95%CI): 21,26 (10,83-31,70)). No differences between the axillary lymph nodedissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy groups (MD (95% CI): 8,47(-7,84-24,79)) were found. Myoelectric activity in the triceps brachii wasgreater in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group (MD (95% CI): 2,70 (-2,06-7,60)).BC survivors exhibited less shoulder and elbow range of motion during ULNT1 than healthy women. Increased upper limb nerve mechanosensitivity in BC survivors was associated with a greater protective muscle response during ULNT1.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
