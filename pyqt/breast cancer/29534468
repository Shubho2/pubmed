Although a lot of studies have pointed out the pivotal roles of the Rac1 pathway in theprogression of breast carcinomas, the clinical significance of ARHGAP15 hasremained largely unknown in human breast carcinomas. Therefore, weimmunolocalized ARHGAP15 in one hundred breast carcinoma tissues. ARHGAP15immunoreactivity was frequently detected in the cytoplasm of carcinoma cells, andwas positively correlated with that of Rac1 and androgen receptor labeling index.Furthermore, ARHGAP15 immunoreactivity was significantly correlated withdecreased risk of recurrence and improved prognosis, and multivariate analysesdemonstrated that ARHGAP15 immunoreactivity was an independent prognostic factor for both disease-free and breast-cancer-specific survival of the patients. Inaddition, exogenous overexpression of ARHGA15 suppressed cell proliferation andmigration of MCF-7 cells and SK-BR-3 cells. On the other hand, ARHGAP15 mRNA was significantly induced by dihydrotestosterone. These findings suggest thatARHGAP15 is an androgen-induced gene and has anti-tumorigenic roles associatedwith the Rac1 pathway. ARHGAP15 immunoreactivity is therefore considered a potentprognostic factor in human breast carcinomas.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19030804 PMCID: PMC5877665PMID: 29534468
