A growing number of trials have been investigating in this aspect andsome studies found a superior performance of DWI compared with conventionalimaging techniques. However, the efficiency of DWI is still in dispute. Thismeta-analysis aims at evaluating the accuracy of DWI in the detection of pCR toNACT in patients with breast cancer.METHODS: Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) weredrawn to estimate the diagnostic effect of DWI to NACT. Summary receiveroperating characteristic curve (SROC), the area under the SROC curve (AUC), andYouden index (*Q) were also calculated. The possible sources of heterogeneityamong the included studies were explored using single-factor meta-regressionanalyses. Publication bias and quality assessment were assessed using Deek'sfunnel plot and QUADAS-2 form respectively.RESULTS: Twenty studies incorporated 1490 participants were enrolled in ouranalysis. Pooled estimates revealed a sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.91), a specificity of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68-0.75), and a DOR of 27.00 (95% CI,15.60-46.73). The AUC of SROC curve and *Q index were 0.9088 and 0.8408,respectively. The results of meta-regression analyses showed that pCR rate, time duration of study population, and study design were not the sources ofheterogeneity.CONCLUSION: A relatively high sensitivity and specificity of DWI in diagnosingpCP for patients with breast cancer underwent NACT treatment was found in ourmeta-analysis. This finding indicated that the use of DWI might provide anaccurate and precise assessment of pCR to NACT.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1438-y PMCID: PMC6052572PMID: 30021656
