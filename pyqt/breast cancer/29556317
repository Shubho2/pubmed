The present study investigated the magnitude ofsafety margins for the radiation boost setup on skin marks or metal clipsimplanted into the tumor bed during breast cancer surgery. One hundredeighty-four patients after breast conserving surgery with implanted metal clipsinto tumor bed were analyzed. The present study investigated the difference insafety margin required for the treatment setup on skin marks and metal clips. Theskin marks were created using a positioning laser system in the treatment room.Metal clips implanted in the tumor bed were registered using IGRT withkilovoltage X-rays in orthogonal projection. Treatment setup was performed duringfree breathing. The safety margin corresponding to the planning target volume(PTV) was calculated from the recorded data. Calculated safety margins for thetreatment setup on skin marks were 9.4, 11.1 and 11.1 mm in the anteroposterior, craniocaudal, and laterolateral directions, respectively. Corresponding safetymargins with the use of IGRT and metal clips registration were 4.7, 5.1 and 5.9mm, respectively. The safe PTV margin was 12 mm using setup on skin marks withoutIGRT, whereas a 6-mm margin was sufficient with the use of metal clip-based IGRT with daily online correction. IGRT has been adopted as the standard treatmentmethod within the Oncology Centre of Multiscan and Pardubice Hospital (Pardubice,Czech Republic).DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8083 PMCID: PMC5844069PMID: 29556317
