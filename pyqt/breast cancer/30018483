Survival curves foroverall survival were plotted with a Kaplan-Meier analysis. The log-rank test wasused for univariate comparisons.RESULTS: In a cohort of 893 patients, the median number of examined LNs was twofor the entire cohort. The survival for the 1 LN group was significantly poorerthan those of the stage I and II disease groups and for the entire cohort. Bydichotomizing the number of LNs from 1 to 6, we found that the minimum number of LNs that should be examined was four for stage I, four or five for stage II, and six for stage IIIA disease. Therefore, for the entire cohort, the number ofexamined LNs should be at least six, which is exactly consistent with theAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer criteria.CONCLUSION: The examination of higher numbers of LNs is associated with improved survival after resection surgery for N0 GBC. The guidelines for GBC surgery,which recommend that six LNs be examined at least, are statistically valid andshould be applied in clinical practice widely.DOI: 10.3748/wjg.v24.i26.2886 PMCID: PMC6048429PMID: 30018483
