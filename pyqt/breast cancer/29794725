Demographic andclinical data, including tumor characteristics and details ofadjuvant/neoadjuvant therapies used, were collected. Data analysis includedunivariate analysis, multivariate logistic regression, and subgroup analyses.Of4994 HER2+ patients (mean age 51.1 ± 9.9 years) included, only 29.8% receivedtrastuzumab, with 30.5% in adjuvant therapy and 18.3% in neoadjuvant therapy. Thehighest rates of adjuvant trastuzumab were in Beijing (59.3%), Jiangsu (57.1%),and Ningxia (50.0%), while those of neoadjuvant trastuzumab were in Guangdong(24.8%), Beijing (14.1%), and Zhejiang (10.7%). Multivariate regression resultsrevealed that factors associated with trastuzumab use were medical insurancecover for trastuzumab, residing locally to the hospital, more lymph nodeinvolvement, and more advanced tumor stage. Subgroup analysis revealed thatpatients receiving neoadjuvant therapy were likely to be younger, premenopausaland non-local, and had lymph node metastases, more advanced tumor, andprogesterone receptor positive tumor.Trastuzumab use in patients with HER2+breast cancer is relatively low in China, especially for neoadjuvant therapy.Insurance coverage seems to be the most correlated factor that influences the useof trastuzumab in Chinese patients with HER2+ breast cancer.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010350 PMID: 29794725  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
