The targetcompounds (1-22) were evaluated quantitatively for their cytotoxic effects invitro against three cancer cell lines, including the lung A549, the hepatocyteHepG2, and the breast MCF-7 carcinoma cells. Compounds 1, 12, 14, and 21 werefound to exhibit remarkable cytotoxicity against the tested cancer cell lines.Compound 21 has shown the highest activity against A549 and MCF-7 (IC50: 9.8 &3.6 µg mL-1) whereas 1 (IC50: 5.9 µg mL-1) and 5 (3.6 µg mL-1) were the mostactive against HepG2. To elucidate the structure-cytotoxicity relationships ofthe synthesized compounds, a number of their chemical descriptors are determined including electronic, steric and hydrophobicity descriptors. The electronicproperties were calculated through density functional theory (DFT) calculationsat the B3LYP/6-31 + G(d,p). The impact of the chosen descriptors is evaluatedstatistically through simple and multiple linear regression analyses (SLR andMLR). SLR analyses reveal that the impact of each descriptor on the cell linesare relatively weak except for MCF-7, where hardness and softness show moderatecorrelations with correlation coefficients higher than 60%. The correlations wereimproved by considering MLR analyses (R2 ≥ 90%), which showed that thecytotoxicity of synthesized compounds is correlated with their combineddescriptors hardness, softness, electrophiliciy and hydrophobicity (LogP).DOI: 10.1007/s12013-018-0848-3 PMID: 30062659
