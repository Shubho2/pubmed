However, the role andunderlying mechanisms of KIF26B in breast cancer cells remain unknown.Materials and methods: In this study, we inhibited the expression of KIF26B inMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells using lentivirus-delivered shRNA.Results: Lentivirus-mediated KIF26B knockdown significantly suppressed cellproliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, cell cycleanalyses revealed that the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase wassignificantly increased in KIF26B knockdown cells. Moreover, the knockdown ofKIF26B significantly promoted cell apoptosis via the upregulation of cleavedcaspase-3 and Bax.Conclusion: Our data indicate that KIF26B plays a pivotal role in tumor growthand metastasis in breast cancer cells and may be a potential therapeutic targetfor treating breast cancer.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S163346 PMCID: PMC5985780PMID: 29881293
