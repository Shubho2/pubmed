No formal evaluation of its differential motor- and sensory-blockingabilities has been reported. We hypothesize that the PECS I block will produce a motor block of the pectoralis muscles with diminished upper limb adductionstrength as measured with a handheld dynamometer.METHODS: We conducted a PECS I block in a randomized placebo-controlled trial in six healthy subjects who received 0.4 mL·kg-1 of 0.9% saline (placebo) on oneside and bupivacaine (0.25% with 1:400 000 epinephrine) on the other. We measuredboth upper limb adduction strength with a dynamometer and sensory skin levelsover the thorax.RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation [SD]) adductor strength evaluated beforethe block was 119.4 (20.7) Newtons (N). After the PECS I block with bupivacaine, the mean (SD) strength of 54.2 (16.3) N was compared with 116.0 (30.4) N in theplacebo group (difference in means 61.8 N; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27.8 to 95.8 N; P = 0.005), showing a 54.6% (95% CI, 43.6 to 65.6%) reduction in adductorstrength. There was no difference in dermatomal skin sensory testing between the placebo and bupivacaine sides.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a PECS I block produces motor blockade asshown by reduced upper limb adductor strength without any overlying dermatomalsensory loss.TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03040167) 2 February 2017.DOI: 10.1007/s12630-018-1122-2 PMID: 29600482
