Variables examined were diagnosis, physical functioning, symptoms atthe start of sedation, medications and dosages used, and type, level, and time ofsedation. Descriptive and correlational statistics were obtained.RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were included, 70% of which were women. The patients had an average age of 61 years (range 24-87), and 74% had a Karnofsky Index (KI) of 50% or less. The most frequent diagnosis was breast cancer (22%), and 82% had metastatic cancer. The prevalence of palliative sedation was 2% and the mostcommon symptoms indicating it were dyspnea (59%), delirium (45%), and pain (32%).All patients received midazolam as a sedative. The average time between theinterval start and culmination of sedation was 44 h. There was a significant and inverse relationship between functionality and time under sedation.CONCLUSIONS: Palliative sedation is a valid therapeutic option for refractorysymptoms causing suffering. The results correspond to international reports andguidelines, which suggests that PS is tailored to the needs of the individualpatient while maintaining a high scientific standard, even in a context where PC is under development. However, further development of strategies and clearindications towards the use of PS in Colombia are needed, given its still scarce use.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4164-7 PMID: 29600413
