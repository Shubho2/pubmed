Thepurpose of the study was to observe the features of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and the combination with Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System(BI-RADS) of conventional ultrasound for assessing small breast lesions.OBJECTIVES: The study was to explore the small breast lesions' features ofcontrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and the combination with BreastImaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) of conventional ultrasound, in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of early breast cancer.METHODS: 105 lesions were subject to conventional US (ultrasound) and CEUS beforeoperations or biopsies. Among 105 breast lesions, six patient diagnoses wereestablished by thick core-needle biopsy, while the rest were all confirmed bysurgery and pathology.RESULTS: Significant differences were found between benign and malignant lesions in qualitative and quantitative indexes (peak) of CEUS (P < 0.05). Thequalitative features of malignant small breast lesions were as follows: (1)enhanced intensity within the lesion was not uniform (61/61,100%); (2) the speed of wash-in was earlier than the surrounding tissue (58/61, 95.1%); (3) lesioninterior and the surrounding tissues had contrast vessel performance(61/61,100%). Peak of malignant lesions (35.77±11.45) was higher than that ofbenign lesions (31.96±10.76) (P < 0.05). The diagnostic performance of BI-RADS-USplus qualitative indexes (method one) in terms of area under receiver operatingcharacteristic curve (AUROC) were the highest (i.e., AUROC = 0.817), incomparison with other combined diagnostic methods. The associated sensitivity,specificity and accuracy were 78.69%, 84.09% and 80.95%, respectively. Withmethod one, however, was similar with US-BI-RADS in specificity, 11 malignantbreast lesions were regarded as a higher classification of BI-RADS and classifiedinto malignant group, which were identified as benign on US-BI-RADS originally.CONCLUSIONS: CEUS was useful to differentiate benign from malignant small breast lesions, and the combination of CEUS and BI-RADS-US can improve the earlydiagnosis of breast cancers.DOI: 10.3233/CH-170368 PMID: 29710688
