The holistic results from this large assessment should be taken intoaccount to appreciate the validity of the development and the interpretations.SB3 is the first trastuzumab biosimilar approved for routine use in Europe. Thepresent manuscript reviews the development and the results of SB3, includingclinical assessment and the clinical Phase I, as well as the large randomizedPhase III comparing efficacy between SB3 versus Herceptin® containing regimen in neoadjuvant setting. Key points of the design and interpretations of the findingsare extensively discussed in this review of SB3 development.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2018-0270 PMID: 29927335
