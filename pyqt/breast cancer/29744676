Little is known on factors that influencerecovery from the impairment. We evaluated the associations of dietary intake andsupplement use with post-therapy cognitive recovery in a large cohort of breastcancer survivors.METHODS: This study included 1047 breast cancer patients aged 20-75 who wererecruited to the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study between 2002 and 2006 atapproximately 6.5 months post-cancer diagnosis. Two cognitive assessmentscovering immediate memory, delayed memory, verbal fluency, and attention, wereconducted at 18 and 36 months post-diagnosis. We used food frequencyquestionnaire to collect information on their dietary intake and supplement usebetween 18 and 36 months post-diagnosis. Linear regression models were used toexamine the associations of dietary intake and supplement use with mean cognitivescores at 36 months post-diagnosis and with differences in cognitive scoresbetween 18 and 36 months post-diagnosis.RESULTS: Higher vegetable, fruit and fish intake, supplementation with vitamin B and vitamin E, and tea drinking were associated with higher cognitive scores,while alcohol drinking was associated with lower cognitive scores at 36 monthspost-diagnosis. Vegetable intake was positively associated with improvement inverbal fluency, while tea drinking and fish oil supplementation were associatedwith greater improvements in delayed memory between 18 and 36 monthspost-diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that higher vegetable intake, tea drinking, andfish oil supplementation may help post-therapy cognitive recovery for cancerpatients.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4805-z PMID: 29744676
