The clinicopathological characteristics and prognosticfeatures of CATS are unclear.Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, weidentified 149,026 patients diagnosed with upper outer quadrant breast cancer(UOBC) (n=146,343) or CATS (n=2,683). The median follow-up was 88 months. Theprimary and secondary outcomes were breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) andoverall survival. The survival outcomes of UOBC and CATS were compared usingcompeting risks analysis, log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards regressionmodel, and propensity score matching method. Multivariate logistic regression wasutilized to present the relationship between CATS and lymph node (LN) metastasis.Results: CATS presented a higher grade, higher negative hormone receptor rate,and more positive nodal metastasis. The 10-year BCSS rate was worse for CATS thanfor UOBC (85.1% vs 87.3%, P=0.001). The multivariate Cox analysis showed a higherhazard ratio (HR) for CATS over UOBC (BCSS: HR =1.20, P=0.001; overall survival: HR =1.11, P=0.019). The difference in the BCSS was also observed in a 1:1 matchedcohort (BCSS P=0.019). A subgroup analysis revealed the inferior outcomes of CATSin the metastatic LN subgroup and the hormone receptor-negative subgroup. Themultivariate logistic regression indicated that CATS is an independentcontributing factor to LN metastasis.Conclusion: CATS had distinct clinicopathological characteristics and was morelikely associated with LN metastasis. Compared to UOBC, CATS had adverse impacts on BCSS.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S165291 PMCID: PMC5958946PMID: 29795985
