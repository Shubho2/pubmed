The objective of this study was todescribe trends in racial disparities overall and by reconstructive technique.METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality ImprovementProgram database was used to identify women who underwent mastectomy and/orbreast reconstruction from 2005 to 2014. Patient demographics were recorded, and cases were grouped by reconstructive status and technique. Trends were assessedwith the Cochran-Armitage test and the index of disparity.RESULTS: Over the study period, 92,960 postmastectomy patients were identified(77,049 white women, 10,396 black women, 4939 Asian women, and 576 NativeAmerican women), of whom 46,931 underwent reconstruction. Of these, 7692 womenunderwent autologous reconstructions (3913 free flaps and 3696 pedicled flaps).From 2005 to 2014, receipt of breast reconstruction by postmastectomy patientsrose from 33.2% to 60.0%, receipt of autologous reconstruction by patients whounderwent breast reconstruction fell from 30.4% to 15.9%, and receipt offree-flap reconstruction by patients who underwent autologous reconstruction rosefrom 15.0% to 70.8%. These trends were significant in all racial subgroups(P < .001), except for Native Americans (P = .269). The index of disparitydecreased from 51.4% to 22.6% for overall receipt of breast reconstruction,decreased from 10.7% to 7.0% for tissue expander and implant-basedreconstruction, increased from 18.0% to 27.3% for autologous reconstruction, and decreased from 66.7% to 4.3% for free-flap reconstruction.CONCLUSIONS: The use of postmastectomy breast reconstruction is steadily risingin the United States. Racial disparities persist, but progress has been made.Further efforts are needed to reduce racial disparities.
