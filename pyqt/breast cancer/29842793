Cancer occurs through the uncontrolled development of new abnormalcell growth. Clinicians and researchers strive to improve diagnostics andtreatments in pursuit of remedying breast cancer, while limiting or removing any potential side effects that may arise. Unfortunately, traditional treatments,such as anthracyclines (i.e., doxorubicin), can damage the cardiovascular system.Recent strategies have utilized antibody-based compounds as singular treatments, or in conjunction with other treatments, with the aim to minimize side effects.The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein has been the targetof numerous antibody-based breast cancer therapies, such as trastuzumab (TZM) andtrastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). This review will discuss the HER2 receptor as adiagnostic marker in targeting breast cancer using the therapeutic agents TZM andT-DM1, as well as discuss the induced cardiac toxicity following TZM and T-DM1treatments.DOI: 10.1139/cjpp-2018-0005 PMID: 29842793
