In thiswork, we performed knockdown of IGFBP6 gene in MDA-MB-231 cells and obtained astable cell line. Knockdown of IGFBP6 gene was confirmed by the real-time PCR.The influence of IGFBP6 gene on migration and proliferation of breast cancercells was studied. Knockdown of IGFBP6 gene reduced migration activity ofMDA-MB-231 cells and increased their proliferation rate. This in vitro cell modelcan be used for the further analysis of the role of IGFBP6 gene in thepathogenesis of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10517-018-4060-7 PMID: 29582205
