LVW@caltech.edu.We have developed a single-breath-hold photoacoustic computed tomography(SBH-PACT) system to reveal detailed angiographic structures in human breasts.SBH-PACT features a deep penetration depth (4 cm in vivo) with high spatial andtemporal resolutions (255 µm in-plane resolution and a 10 Hz 2D frame rate). Byscanning the entire breast within a single breath hold (~15 s), a volumetricimage can be acquired and subsequently reconstructed utilizing 3D back-projectionwith negligible breathing-induced motion artifacts. SBH-PACT clearly revealstumors by observing higher blood vessel densities associated with tumors at high spatial resolution, showing early promise for high sensitivity inradiographically dense breasts. In addition to blood vessel imaging, the highimaging speed enables dynamic studies, such as photoacoustic elastography, which identifies tumors by showing less compliance. We imaged breast cancer patientswith breast sizes ranging from B cup to DD cup, and skin pigmentations rangingfrom light to dark. SBH-PACT identified all the tumors without resorting toionizing radiation or exogenous contrast, posing no health risks.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04576-z PMCID: PMC6003984PMID: 29907740
