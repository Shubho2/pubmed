Partners of younger survivors (YPs) mayexperience greater problems than partners of older survivors (OPs), just asyounger survivors experience greater problems than their older counterparts.OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to (1) compare quality of life (QoL) inYPs and OPs and (2) determine contributing factors to each group's QoL.METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from YPs (n = 227) and OPs (n = 281)through self-report. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to determinedifferences between YPs and OPs on QoL while controlling for covariates. Multipleregression analyses were conducted to determine what contributes to each group's QoL.RESULTS: Partners of younger survivors reported better physical function (effect size [ES], -0.57), lower marital satisfaction (ES, 0.39), and lower overall QoL(ES, 0.43) than OPs. Predictors of QoL also differed between partner groups. For YPs, overall QoL was predicted by greater physical functioning, fewer depressive symptoms, higher marital satisfaction, higher parenting satisfaction, and morepersonal resources (R = 0.47, F5,195 = 35.05, P < .001). For OPs, overall QoL waspredicted by fewer depressive symptoms, higher parenting satisfaction, higherspirituality, and greater social support from the breast cancer survivor spouse(R = 0.33, F4,244 = 29.80, P < .001).CONCLUSION: Partners of older survivors reported greater QoL than YPs. Commonfactors contributing to QoL between YPs and OPs were fewer depressive symptomsand higher parenting satisfaction.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Partners of breast cancer survivors may need supportcoping with their spouse/partner's cancer. Partners of younger survivors mayrequire more support than OPs.DOI: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000556 PMID: 29538019
