[Epub ahead of print]TPC2 mediates autophagy progression and extracellular vesicle secretion in cancercells.Sun W(1), Yue J(2).Author information: (1)City University of Hong Kong ShenZhen Research Institute, ShenZhen, China;Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong,China.(2)City University of Hong Kong ShenZhen Research Institute, ShenZhen, China;Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong,China. Electronic address: jianbyue@cityu.edu.hk.Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation process, and isinvolved in various cellular processes. Here we studied the role of two porechannel 2 (TPC2), a lysosomal non-selective Na+/Ca2+ channel, in autophagyprogression. We found that TPC overexpression in 4T1 mouse breast cancer cellline or in HeLa human cervical cancer cell line inhibited the fusion betweenautophagosome and lysosome, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomesaccompanied with increased lysosomal pH and TFEB nuclear localization.Interestingly, we also found that extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion wasmarkedly decreased in TPC2 overexpressing cells but was induced in TPC2 knockdowncells. In addition, migration of TPC2 knockdown cells, not TPC2 overexpressingcells, was inhibited. Taken together, these results support a role of TPC2 inautophagy progression and EV trafficking in cancer cells.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
