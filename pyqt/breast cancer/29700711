[Epub ahead of print]Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors in hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer: preliminary results and ongoing studies.Kwapisz D(1).Author information: (1)Specialist Outpatient Clinic, Warsaw, Poland. dmkwapisz@gmail.com.The cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-inhibitors (CDK4/6i) induce cellcycle arrest in the G1 phase what eventually can prevent the proliferation ofcancer cells. The CDK4/6i have changed the landscape of treatment options forER-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. Currently, palbociclib,ribociclib, and abemaciclib are approved by the US Food and Drug Administrationin this setting. This success encouraged the researchers to examine CDK4/6iactivity in (neo)adjuvant setting. In this review, clinical data to date andongoing clinical trials with palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib in theearly breast cancer are discussed. A literature search of these topics wascarried out using PubMed and data reported at international oncology meetings andclinicaltrials.gov were included. Currently, we have the early promising datafrom Phase II clinical trials of CDK4/6i efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting inwomen with HR-positive breast cancer. Moreover, there are numerous studies thatare in progress today in (neo)adjuvant setting.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0864-6 PMID: 29700711
