Theprobability of their occurrence ranges from about 5% in the entire population to as much as 30% in the late stages of the disease. Although rarelylife-threatening, they have a major impact on the quality of life of patientswith this diagnosis, being the cause of pain, effusion, ulceration, infection,and psychological discomfort. Available methods of treatment, both local andsystemic, often fail to provide adequate control of the disease. A particularchallenge seems to be the treatment of those patients with cutaneous metastaseswho, due to the extent of their metastases, are not eligible for resection, inwhom the possibility of radiation therapy has already been used, and in whomsystemic therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. A new method providing theopportunity for effective treatment is electrochemotherapy (ECT). ECT combineselectropulsation of tumor cells (by local application of electric pulses) andadministration of antineoplastic drugs such as cisplatin or bleomycin (eitherintravenous or intratumoral). Several clinical studies have demonstrated that ECTprovides safe, efÔ¨Åcient, and non-invasive locoregional treatment for chest wallbreast cancer recurrence.DOI: 10.1159/000479954 PMCID: PMC5803732 [Available on 2018-12-01]PMID: 29456474
