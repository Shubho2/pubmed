This includesfungating, infected tumors, previous radiotherapy, scars, smoking, diabetes, and morbid obesity. Bioprosthesis Acelluar Dermal Matrix Strattice would be asubstitute to resist infection and provide stable coverage.Methods: A retrospective data analysis study on 8 high-risk patients whounderwent chest wall resection and reconstruction with bioprosthesis (Strattice) with/without titanium plates in the period between 2012 and 2017 was performed.Patient's demographics, risk factors, clinico-pathological, radiological,operative details, adjuvant therapy, postoperative morbidity, and follow-up data were recorded.Results: Sarcoma was the pathology in 7 and recurrent breast cancer in 1 with agerange from 21 to 71 years (mean, 50) and preponderance of female patients (n =5). Defects were located anterior/anterolateral with size ranging from 270 to1,050â€‰cm2 (mean, 511). Reconstruction was performed using Strattice only in 4patients, whereas in 4 it was combined with titanium plates. All patientsrequired flap reconstruction (3 pedicled and 5 free). The follow-up ranged from 9to 52 months (mean, 24.8). Minor complications occurred in 2 patients; however,good functional outcome was achieved in all.Conclusion: Strattice would act as a safe alternative modality for chest wallreconstruction to resist infection in high-risk patients with extensive defects. It should be considered as a valuable tool in the armamentarium of chest wallreconstruction.DOI: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000001703 PMCID: PMC5999444PMID: 29922541
