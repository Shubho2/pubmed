Electronicaddress: osbornlindsay@gmail.com.(2)Department of Dermatology, University of California at San Diego School ofMedicine, La Jolla, CA.The healing process after breast cancer treatment is predominantly focused towardthe physical changes to the body that a patient has experienced. Breastreconstructions are considered standard of care after mastectomy, and the nipple and areolar complex is often reconstructed as well, using a combination of skingraft and tattoo. A patient who decided to forego nipple reconstruction andareolar tattooing and instead chooses to apply decorative temporary tattoos toher breast reconstruction is described. Compared with permanent tattoos, theseunconventional tattoos allow the patient to change the design to fit her mood.Unconventional tattoos are an alternative and creative approach to the healingprocess, in which artistic and individual expression allows the patient toembrace the physical change she has undergone as a breast cancer survivor.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.
