Weprofiled 45,000 immune cells from eight breast carcinomas, as well as matchednormal breast tissue, blood, and lymph nodes, using single-cell RNA-seq. Wedeveloped a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering andnormalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent tosingle-cell data. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumortissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypic expansionsspecific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of paired single-cell RNA andT cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000 additional T cells revealed thecombinatorial impact of TCR utilization on phenotypic diversity. Our resultssupport a model of continuous activation in T cells and do not comport with themacrophage polarization model in cancer. Our results have important implications for characterizing tumor-infiltrating immune cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.060 PMID: 29961579
