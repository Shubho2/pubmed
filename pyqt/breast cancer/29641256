The authors developed and subsequently investigated a cancer cell-selective small molecule phospholipidether analog to deliver 125I to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells invivo.METHODS: A Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) method to radiolabel125I-CLR1404 (CLR 125) with >95% radiochemical purity was established. Toestimate CLR 125 in vivo dosimetry and identify dose-limiting organs, thebiodistribution of the analog compound 124I-CLR1404 (CLR 124) was investigatedusing micro-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) inconjunction with a Monte Carlo dosimetry platform to estimate CLR 125 dosimetry. In vivo antitumor efficacy was tested by injecting nude mice bearing eitherMDA-MB-231-luc orthotopic xenografts or lung metastases with 74 MBq (3.7 GBq/kg) of CLR 125 or an equivalent mass amount of nonradiolabeled CLR 125. Longitudinal tumor measurements using calipers and bioluminescence imaging were obtained forthe xenografts and lung metastases, respectively.RESULTS: Dosimetry analysis estimated that CLR 125 would impart the largestabsorbed dose to the tumor per injected activity (0.261 ± 0.023 Gy/MBq) while thebone marrow, which is generally the dose-limiting organ for CLR1404, appears tohave the lowest (0.063 ± 0.005 Gy/MBq). At administered activities of up to74 MBq (3.7 GBq/kg), mice did not experience signs of toxicity. In addition, asingle dose of CLR 125 reduced the volume of orthotopic primary TNBC xenograftsby ∼60% compared to control vehicle (p < 0.001) and significantly extendedsurvival. In addition, CLR 125 was efficacious against preclinical metastaticTNBC models by inhibiting the progression of micrometastases (p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Targeted radionuclide therapy with CLR 125 displayed significantantitumor efficacy in vivo, suggesting promise for treatment of TNBCmicrometastases.DOI: 10.1089/cbr.2017.2376 PMCID: PMC5905872 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29641256
