Moreover, we discuss thefuture potential of breast MRE, which goes beyond its original application as an additional tool in differentiating benign from malignant breast lesions. Theseareas of ongoing and future research include MRE for pre-operative tumourdelineation, staging, monitoring and predicting response to treatment, as well asprediction of the metastatic potential of primary tumours.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/nbm.3932 PMID: 29846986
