CFI-400945 is a highly selective PLK4 inhibitor that deregulatescentriole duplication, causing mitotic defects and death of aneuploid cancers.Prior work was substantially extended by showing CFI-400945 causes polyploidy,growth inhibition, and apoptotic death of murine and human lung cancer cells,despite expression of mutated KRAS or p53. Analysis of DNA content by propidiumiodide (PI) staining revealed cells with >4N DNA content (polyploidy) markedlyincreased after CFI-400945 treatment. Centrosome numbers and mitotic spindleswere scored. CFI-400945 treatment produced supernumerary centrosomes and mitotic defects in lung cancer cells. In vivo antineoplastic activity of CFI-400945 wasestablished in mice with syngeneic lung cancer xenografts. Lung tumor growth was significantly inhibited at well-tolerated dosages. Phosphohistone H3 staining of resected lung cancers following CFI-400945 treatment confirmed the presence ofaberrant mitosis. PLK4 expression profiles in human lung cancers were exploredusing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH) ofmicroarrays containing normal and malignant lung tissues. PLK4 expression wassignificantly higher in the malignant versus normal lung and conferred anunfavorable survival (P < 0.05). Intriguingly, cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)antagonism cooperated with PLK4 inhibition. Taken together, PLK4 inhibition aloneor as part of a combination regimen is a promising way to combat lung cancer.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1719760115 PMCID: PMC5828621 [Available on 2018-08-20]PMID: 29434041  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
