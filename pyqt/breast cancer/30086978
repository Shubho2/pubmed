Specifically, using a biomarker to detect H2O2 in physiologicalconditions is of great significance for understanding the signal transductionpathways and achieving early cancer diagnosis. In this work, we report aninnovative H2O2 sensor that was fabricated by trimetallic AuPtPd nanocompositesplatform on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets with the modification of the rGO and trimetallic AuPtPd nanoparticles on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) byphysical adsorption. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction(XRD) were utilized to characterize and identify these unique nanocomposites. In addition, the electrochemical properties of the proposed sensor were evaluated bycyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Electrochemical research hasdemonstrated that the AuPtPd/rGO-modified GCE showed excellent electrocatalyticactivity towards the reduction of H2O2, including a wider linear range from0.005 μM to 6.5 mM, a low detection limit of 2 nM, good selectivity andacceptable repeatability. Moreover, the sensor can monitor the release of H2O2release from living cancer cells. Therefore, this study not only improvessimplicity, sensitivity and quantitatively for detection H2O2 in cells at nMlevel but also provides a foundation for the biological and biomedicalapplications such as the early diagnosis of cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
