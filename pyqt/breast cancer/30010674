Whether these effectsare due to Trp depletion in the TME or mediated by the accumulation of the IDO1and/or TDO (hereafter referred to as IDO1/TDO) product kynurenine (Kyn) remainscontroversial. Here we show that administration of a pharmacologically optimized enzyme (PEGylated kynureninase; hereafter referred to as PEG-KYNase) thatdegrades Kyn into immunologically inert, nontoxic and readily cleared metabolitesinhibits tumor growth. Enzyme treatment was associated with a marked increase in the tumor infiltration and proliferation of polyfunctional CD8+ lymphocytes. Weshow that PEG-KYNase administration had substantial therapeutic effects whencombined with approved checkpoint inhibitors or with a cancer vaccine for thetreatment of large B16-F10 melanoma, 4T1 breast carcinoma or CT26 colon carcinomatumors. PEG-KYNase mediated prolonged depletion of Kyn in the TME and reversedthe modulatory effects of IDO1/TDO upregulation in the TME.DOI: 10.1038/nbt.4180 PMCID: PMC6078800 [Available on 2019-01-16]PMID: 30010674
