The validated Brazilian versions of the WorkProductivity and Activity Impairment-General Health questionnaire and WorkLimitations Questionnaire were self-administered.RESULTS: The groups were homogeneous regarding age, education level, and othersociodemographic characteristics. Patients in the mastectomy andbreast-conserving surgery groups showed reduced work performance and productivitycompared with women in the breast reconstruction and control groups (P = 0.0004and P = 0.0006, respectively). In addition, women in the mastectomy group hadmore difficulty in performing activities of daily living compared with those inother groups (P = 0.0121).CONCLUSIONS: Women who had undergone mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery had decreased work ability and productivity compared with women without a history of breast cancer and to those who had undergone breast reconstruction.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001562 PMID: 30028756
