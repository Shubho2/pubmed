Re-analyzing expression data from multiple microarray experiments, weselected a set of key regulatory genes involved in proliferation regulation andestrogen signaling to monitor estrogen-induced transcription changes. We thencompared these expression changes after 17β-estradiol and a membrane receptorselective estrogen-BSA treatment using quantitative real-time PCR. In order tofollow receptor trafficking we used light and electron microscopy.RESULTS: Our quantitative real-time PCR results confirmed that the selectivemembrane receptor agonist, estrogen-BSA induces similarly pronounced expressionchanges regarding these genes as 17β-estradiol. Morphological study revealed thatthe membrane-bound form of classical estrogen receptor alpha is internalizedafter ligand binding via dynamin-dependent, caveola-mediated endocytosis.Inhibition of this internalization with dynamin inhibitor, dynasore practicallyabolished the regulatory effect of E2-BSA, suggesting that interaction andinternalization with the scaffold protein is necessary for effective signaling.CONCLUSIONS: The physiological role of plasma membrane estrogen receptor alpha isintensively studied, yet there are still several aspects of it to be resolved.The dynamin-dependent, ligand-mediated internalization of mERs seems to play animportant role in estrogen signaling. Our results may serve as another exampleof how membrane initiated estrogen signaling and nuclear receptor initiatedsignaling overlap and form an intertwined system.DOI: 10.1186/s40001-018-0328-7 PMCID: PMC5992704PMID: 29880033
