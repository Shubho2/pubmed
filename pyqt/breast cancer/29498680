Therefore, identifying disease-related miRNAs is a crucialproblem. Currently, many computational approaches have been proposed to predictbinary miRNA-disease associations. In this study, in order to predict underlying miRNA-disease association types, a semi-supervised model called the network-basedlabel propagation algorithm is proposed to infer multiple types of miRNA-disease associations (NLPMMDA) by mutual information derived from the heterogeneousnetwork. The NLPMMDA method integrates disease semantic similarity, miRNAfunctional similarity, and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarityinformation of miRNAs and diseases to construct a heterogeneous network. NLPMMDA is a semi-supervised model which does not require verified negative samples.Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was implemented for four known types ofmiRNA-disease associations and demonstrated the reliable performance of ourmethod. Moreover, case studies of lung cancer and breast cancer confirmedeffective performance of NLPMMDA to predict novel miRNA-disease associations and their association types.DOI: 10.3390/genes9030139 PMCID: PMC5867860PMID: 29498680
