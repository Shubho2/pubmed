Healthy Fit uses community health workers to extend public healthdepartment infrastructure and address Hispanic health disparities related tocardiovascular disease and access to preventive health services. We evaluated theeffectiveness of Healthy Fit in 1) reaching Hispanic Americans facing healthdisparities, and 2) helping participants access preventive health services andmake behavior changes to improve heart health.METHODS: Community health workers recruited a sample of predominantly low-income Hispanic immigrant participants (N = 514). Following a health screening,participants received vouchers for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancerscreening, and received vaccinations as needed for influenza, pneumonia, andhuman papillomavirus. Participants who were overweight or had high blood pressurereceived heart health fotonovelas and referrals to community-based exerciseactivities. Community health workers completed follow-up phone calls at 1, 3, and6 months after the health screening to track participant uptake on the referrals and encourage follow-through.RESULTS: Participants faced health disparities related to obesity and screeningfor breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer. Postintervention completion ratesfor breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening were 54%, 43%, and 32%,respectively, among participants who received a voucher and follow-up phone call.Among participants with follow-up data who were overweight or had high bloodpressure, 70% read the fotonovela, 66% completed 1 or more heart healthactivities in the fotonovela, 21% attended 1 or more community-based exerciseactivities, and 79% took up some other exercise on their own.CONCLUSION: Healthy Fit is a feasible and low-cost strategy for addressingHispanic health disparities related to cancer and cardiovascular disease.DOI: 10.5888/pcd15.170347 PMCID: PMC5951157PMID: 29704370
