We assessed determinants ofoncologists' willingness to participate in bundled payment programs for breastcancer. We hypothesized that providers would be more likely to participate inbundled payment programs if offered higher levels of reimbursement for eachepisode of care.METHODS: Oncologists from Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania wereidentified in the AMA database or by patients listed in state cancer registries. Providers were randomized to receive one of four versions of a survey describing bundled payment programs offering different levels of compensation for the first year of localized breast cancer treatment ($5000, $10,000, $15,000, or $20,000). Physicians rated their likelihood of participation in a bundled program on aLikert scale. Logistic regression was used to analyze determinants of likelihood of participation in bundling.RESULTS: Among 460 respondents, only 17% of oncologists were highly likely toparticipate in a bundled program paying $5000 for the first year of care, rising to 41% for the $15,000 program, but falling to 34% for the $20,000 program.Likelihood of participation was higher among oncologists who were male, older,and believed that cancer patients should not be offered high-cost drugs withminimal survival benefit.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that medical oncologists have limited enthusiasm for bundled payments, and higher payments may not overcome resistance to bundlingamong a substantial proportion of physicians.DOI: 10.1186/s12913-018-3202-y PMCID: PMC5984411PMID: 29855315
