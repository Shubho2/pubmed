Thechemosensitivity of the cells to adriamycin (ADR) was detected by a CCK-8 kit.Cell invasion, migration, and apoptosis were assessed. Western blot was used todetect the expression levels of AQP-5, drug resistance-related protein, andapoptosis-related protein.Results: The expression level of AQP-5 in MCF-7/ADR cells was significantlyreduced by AQP-5 siRNA transfection. The invasion and migration weresignificantly reduced in MCF-7/ADR after AQP-5 siRNA interference. AQP-5silencing significantly increased the chemosensitivity of MCF-7/ADR cells to ADR and activated caspase-dependent apoptosis in MCF-7/ADR cells. AQP-5 silencingalso decreased the expression levels of drug resistance-related proteins (P-gpand GST-Ï€).Conclusion: The inhibition of AQP-5 expression may reverse the drug resistanceand enhance the chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S160313 PMCID: PMC5995417PMID: 29922074
