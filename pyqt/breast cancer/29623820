Diet derived bioactive compounds are reported to exhibitmodulation of cancer growth leading to cell death. Chickpea is a protein richedible legume with several bioactive compounds that includes lectin as well.Characterization of chickpea lectin for its effect against cancer cells has been investigated in this study.METHOD: Cicer arietinum L. lectin (CAL) agglutinating trypsin-treated rabbitblood cells was purified employing DEAE-cellulose and SP-sephadex ion exchangechromatography. The lectin was characterized for its biological activityvis-à-vis antiproliferative and apoptotic effects through cell cycle arrest inMCF-7 human breast cancer cells.RESULT: There is a significant inhibition of the survival of breast cancer cells due to chickpea lectin in a dose dependent manner for 24 hr. Lectin treated cellsrevealed distinct features of apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis at 80 µg/ml of lectin induced S and G2 phase cell cycle arrest. CAL induced apoptosis in MCF-7cells associated with lactate dehydrogenase leakage, cell cycle arrest andreactive oxygen species generation.CONCLUSION: Our studies show that chickpea lectin exerted anticancer activity andcould be exploited as an essential source for medicine leading to the treatmentof breast cancer.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/0929866525666180406142900 PMID: 29623820  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
