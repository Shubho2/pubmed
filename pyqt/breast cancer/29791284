Methods We performed a population-basedretrospective cohort study of women receiving chemotherapy for early-stage breastcancer in Ontario between 2007 and 2012. We surveyed for baseline cardiac imaging6 months before chemotherapy or within 30 days thereafter. The proportion ofpatients who underwent imaging and cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rates was determined based on chemotherapy regimen and HF riskfactors. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors of pretreatmentcardiac imaging. Results We studied 18,444 women who had been treated withchemotherapy (median age, 55 years). There was near-universal imaging of womentreated with trastuzumab-containing regimens, including those without additional HF risk factors. Women who received anthracyclines without trastuzumab underwent imaging more frequently if they had additional HF risk factors (73.3% v 62.6%; P < .001). The 5-year incidence of MACE was two to six times higher in patientswith HF risk factors across all treatment regimens. Patients with HF risk factorswho received anthracyclines without trastuzumab had a higher 5-year incidence of MACE (4.5%) than patients without HF risk factors who received trastuzumabwithout anthracyclines (2.6%). However, cardiac imaging was less frequent in the former group (73.3% v 93.6%; P < .001). Logistic regression indicated that mostvariation in baseline imaging was related to chemotherapy, followed byphysician-level factors. The odds of imaging were doubled with female physicians.Patient-specific factors, including HF risk factors, made minimal contribution tovariation in imaging. Conclusion Baseline cardiac imaging was driven bychemotherapy regimen rather than HF risk. This risk-imaging mismatch is animpetus to reconsider current cardiac imaging practices in patients who receivechemotherapy for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2018.77.9736 PMID: 29791284
