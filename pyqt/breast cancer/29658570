China.Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer‑associated mortality, andmetastatic breast cancer is responsible for 90% of patient mortalities. Giventhat JWA represses the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of a number ofother human tumor cells, including melanoma, esophageal, hepatocellular andgastric carcinomas, via mitogen‑activated protein kinase or integrin signaling,the present study investigated the expression and function of JWA in human breastcancers. The results showed that the expression level of JWA was significantlyreduced in human primary breast cancers when compared with the paired adjacenttissues. Downregulating JWA enhanced, while overexpressing JWA suppressed, themigration and invasion abilities of the two breast cancer cell lines, MDA‑MB‑468 and MDA‑MB‑231, without affecting their proliferations in vitro. In addition, JWAnegatively regulated the surface expression of CXCR4 in the two cell lines viaproteasome degradation, though not via transcriptional inhibition. Functionally, normalizing the disturbed expressions of CXCR4 largely reversed the inhibitoryeffect of JWA on cell invasion. These data demonstrated that JWA suppressed themigration/invasion of breast carcinoma cells by downregulating the expression of CXCR4, and suggested that JWA may harbor prognostic and therapeutic potential in patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8866 PMCID: PMC5983986PMID: 29658570
