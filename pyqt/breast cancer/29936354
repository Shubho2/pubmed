Hallera 107, 80-416, Gdańsk, Poland.A series of newN'-(2-alkylthio-4-chloro-5-methylbenzenesulfonyl)-1-(5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)amidine derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated in vitro by MTT assays fortheir antiproliferative activity against cell lines of colon cancer HCT-116,cervical cancer HeLa and breast cancer MCF-7. The studied compounds displayselective activity mainly against HCT-116 and HeLa cells. Thus, five compoundsshow selective cytotoxic effect against HCT-116 (IC50 = 3-10 μM) and HeLa(IC50 = 7 μM). Importantly, the noticed values of IC50 for four compounds arealmost 4-fold lower for HeLa than non-malignant HaCaT cells. More-in-depthbiological research revealed that the treatment of HCT-116 and HeLa with activecompound resulted in increased numbers of cells in sub-G1 phase in a timedependent manner, while non-active derivative does not influence cell cycle.Metabolic stability assays using liver microsomes and NADPH provide importantinformation on compounds susceptibility to phase 1 biotransformation reactions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
