Endogenousestrogen concentrations are positively associated with postmenopausal breastcancer risk and BPE has been shown to be sensitive to hormonal exposures. Theobjective of our study was to examine the relationship between BPE andMRI-density and serum hormone concentrations in postmenopausal women. This was a study of cancer-free postmenopausal women undergoing contrast-enhanced breast MRI(N = 118). At the time of MRI all women completed a self-administeredquestionnaire and blood samples were collected for hormone analyses. Serumconcentrations of estrone (E1), estradiol (E2) and bioavailable E2 were examined by category of BPE and MRI-density. Compared to women with "minimal" BPE, thosewho had "marked" BPE had significantly higher serum concentrations of E1, E2 and bioavailable E2 (90% increase, ptrend across all categories = 0.001; 150%increase, ptrend  = 0.001; and 158% increase, ptrend  = 0.001, respectively).These associations were only affected to a minor extent by adjustment for BMI andother variables. After adjustment for BMI, no significant associations betweenMRI-density and serum E1, E2 and bioavailable E2 were observed. Serum estrogenconcentrations were significantly positively associated with BPE. Our studyprovides further evidence of the hormone-sensitive nature of BPE, indicating apotential role for BPE as an imaging marker of endogenous and exogenous hormonal exposures in the breast.© 2018 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley & SonsLtd on behalf of UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31370 PMCID: PMC6041161PMID: 29524207
