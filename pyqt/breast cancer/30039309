It has been suggested that breast cancer is related to the exposure tocirculating sex hormones. However, relations between MD and hormones have beeninconsistent. In addition, such relations are mainly evaluated in Westernpopulations. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study in 396 cancer-freepostmenopausal Korean women who had never used hormone replacement therapy. Weassayed estradiol, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels. We then calculated free testosterone (cFT) levels. Total and dense areas ofdigital mammogram were measured using a computer-assisted thresholding method,and non-dense area and percent dense area were calculated. Linear mixed model wasused for analyses. Estradiol and testosterone levels were not associated with anyMD measures after adjusting for reproductive factors and body mass index.However, cFT was persistently associated with non-dense area even after adjustingfor covariates, with non-dense area increased by 3.5% per 1 standard deviationincrease of cFT. SHBG showed an inverse association with non-dense area, althoughit showed a positive association with dense area and percent dense arearegardless of adjustment for covariates. Non-dense area was decreased by 5.6%while percent dense area was increased by 13.4% per 1 standard deviation increaseof SHBG. These findings suggest that SHBG might be related with breast cancerrisk, probably through its association with breast density.DOI: 10.1007/s12672-018-0344-7 PMID: 30039309
