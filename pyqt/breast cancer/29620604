[Epub ahead ofprint]Diffusion-Weighted Imaging With Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Mapping for BreastCancer Detection as a Stand-Alone Parameter: Comparison With DynamicContrast-Enhanced and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.Pinker K, Moy L, Sutton EJ, Mann RM, Weber M, Thakur SB, Jochelson MS,Bago-Horvath Z, Morris EA, Baltzer PA, Helbich TH.PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to compare dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) withapparent diffusion coefficient mapping as a stand-alone parameter without anyother supportive sequence for breast cancer detection and to assess itscombination as multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the breast.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved single-center study, prospectively acquired data of 106 patients who underwent breast MRI from 12/2010 to 09/2014 for an imaging abnormality (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 0, 4/5) were retrospectively analyzed. Four readers independently assessedDWI and DCE as well as combined as mpMRI. Breast Imaging Reporting and DataSystem categories, lesion size, and mean apparent diffusion coefficient valueswere recorded. Histopathology was used as the gold standard. Appropriatestatistical tests were used to compare diagnostic values.RESULTS: There were 69 malignant and 41 benign tumors in 106 patients. Fourpatients presented with bilateral lesions. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was the most sensitive test for breast cancer detection, with an average sensitivity of100%. Diffusion-weighted imaging alone was less sensitive (82%; P < 0.001) butmore specific than DCE-MRI (86.8% vs 76.6%; P = 0.002). Diagnostic accuracy was83.7% for DWI and 90.6% for DCE-MRI. Multiparametric MRI achieved a sensitivityof 96.8%, not statistically different from DCE-MRI (P = 0.12) and with a similar specificity as DWI (83.8%; P = 0.195), maximizing diagnostic accuracy to 91.9%.There was almost perfect interreader agreement for DWI (κ = 0.864) and DCE-MRI (κ= 0.875) for differentiation of benign and malignant lesions.CONCLUSION: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is most sensitive for breast cancerdetection and thus still indispensable. Multiparametric MRI using DCE-MRI and DWImaintains a high sensitivity, increases specificity, and maximizes diagnosticaccuracy, often preventing unnecessary breast biopsies. Diffusion-weightedimaging should not be used as a stand-alone parameter because it detectssignificantly fewer cancers in comparison with DCE-MRI and mpMRI.DOI: 10.1097/RLI.0000000000000465 PMID: 29620604
