Towards an Evolutionary View of Bipolar Disorders.Carta MG(1), Preti A(1), Akiskal HS(2).Author information: (1)Department of Health Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari,Cagliari, Italy.(2)University of California at San Diego USA.Human population is increasing in immense cities with millions of inhabitants, inwhich life is expected to run 24 hours a day for seven days a week (24/7). Noise and light pollution are the most reported consequences, with a profound impact onsleep patterns and circadian biorhythms. Disruption of sleep and biorhythms hassevere consequences on many metabolic pathways. Suppression of melatoninincretion at night and the subsequent effect on DNA methylation may increase the risk of prostate and breast cancer. A negative impact of light pollution onneurosteroids may also affect mood. People who carry the genetic risk of bipolar disorder may be at greater risk of full-blown bipolar disorder because of theimpact of noise and light pollution on sleep patterns and circadian biorhythms.However, living in cities may also offers opportunities and might be selectivefor people with hyperthymic temperament, who may find themselves advantaged byincreased energy prompted by increased stimulation produced by life in bigcities. This might result in the spreading of the genetic risk of bipolardisorder in the coming decades. In this perspective the burden of poor quality oflife, increased disability adjusted life years and premature mortality due to theincreases of mood disorders is the negative side of a phenomenon that in itsglobality also shows adaptive aspects. The new lifestyle also influences thosewho adapt and show behaviors, reactions and responses that might resemble thedisorder, but are on the adaptive side.DOI: 10.2174/1745017901814010033 PMCID: PMC5838624PMID: 29541149
