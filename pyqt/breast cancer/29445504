In Korea, about 10-15% of workers are engaged in night-shiftwork, and breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. The purposeof this study was to review epidemiologic evidence on the relationship betweennight work and breast cancer.Methods: We reviewed 21 original articles and 5 meta analyses on relationshipbetween nightwork and breast cancer, and investigated the compensation criteriaof Denmark.Results: The association between breast cancer and night work has been reportedby numerous epidemiologic studies, including cohort studies, case-controlstudies, and meta-analysis. However, a dose-response relationship has not clearlyemerged among workers exposed to less than 20Â years of night work.Conclusion: Although there are some limitations to the epidemiological studies sofar, further consideration of breast cancer cases in patients with high exposure to night work is needed to assess breast cancer as a work-related disease.DOI: 10.1186/s40557-018-0221-4 PMCID: PMC5801774PMID: 29445504
