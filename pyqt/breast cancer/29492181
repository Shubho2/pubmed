In Poland, the causative founder variants in the BRCA1 are responsible for a significant proportion of ovarian cancercases, however, regional differences in the frequencies of various mutations may exist. The spectrum and frequency of BRCA1/2 mutations between ovarian cancerpatients have not yet been studied in the region of South-East Poland.Methods: We examined 158 consecutive unselected cases of ovarian cancer patients from the region of Podkarpacie. We studied 13 Polish causative founder variantsin BRCA1 (c.5266dupC, c.4035delA, c.5251C > T, c.181 T > G, c.676delT,c.68_69delAG, c.3700_3704delGTAAA, c.1687C > T, c.3756_3759delGTCT) and in BRCA2 (c.658_659delGT, c.7910_7914delCCTTT, c.3847_3848delGT, c.5946delT).Results: A BRCA1 causative founder variants were detected in 10 of the 158 (6.3%)ovarian cancer cases. BRCA2 causative founder variants were not observed. Thec.5266dupC mutation was detected in 6 patients, c.181 T > G mutation in 3patients and the c.676delT mutation in 1 patient. The median age of diagnosis of the 10 hereditary ovarian cancers was 55.5 years of age.Conclusions: The frequency of 13 causative founder variants in Podkarpacie waslower than in other regions of Poland. Testing of three BRCA1 mutations(c.5266dupC, c.181 T > G, c.676delT) should be considered a sensitive test panel.DOI: 10.1186/s13053-018-0089-x PMCID: PMC5828315PMID: 29492181
