However,the HSP family is quite large and many of its members have not been investigated in breast cancer (BRCA), particularly in relation with the current molecular BRCAclassification. In this work, we performed a comprehensive transcriptomic studyof the HSP gene family in BRCA patients from both The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC)cohorts discriminating the BRCA intrinsic molecular subtypes.METHODS: We examined gene expression levels of 1097 BRCA tissue samples retrievedfrom TCGA and 1981 samples of METABRIC, focusing mainly on the HSP family (95genes). Data were stratified according to the PAM50 gene expression (Luminal A,Luminal B, HER2, Basal, and Normal-like). Transcriptomic analyses include severalstatistical approaches: differential gene expression, hierarchical clustering andsurvival analysis.RESULTS: Of the 20,531 analysed genes we found that in BRCA almost 30% presented deregulated expression (19% upregulated and 10% downregulated), while of the HSP family 25% appeared deregulated (14% upregulated and 11% downregulated) (|foldchange| > 2 comparing BRCA with normal breast tissues). The study revealed theexistence of shared HSP genes deregulated in all subtypes of BRCA while otherHSPs were deregulated in specific subtypes. Many members of the Chaperoninsubfamily were found upregulated while three members (BBS10, BBS12 and CCTB6)were found downregulated. HSPC subfamily had moderate increments of transcriptslevels. Various genes of the HSP70 subfamily were upregulated; meanwhile, HSPA12Aand HSPA12B appeared strongly downregulated. The strongest downregulation wasobserved in several HSPB members except for HSPB1. DNAJ members showedheterogeneous expression pattern. We found that 23 HSP genes correlated withoverall survival and three HSP-based transcriptional profiles with impact ondisease outcome were recognized.CONCLUSIONS: We identified shared and specific HSP genes deregulated in BRCAsubtypes. This study allowed the recognition of HSP genes not previouslyassociated with BRCA and/or any cancer type, and the identification of threeclinically relevant clusters based on HSPs expression patterns with influence on overall survival.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4621-1 PMCID: PMC6022707PMID: 29954368
