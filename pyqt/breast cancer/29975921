Q-PCR was performed to determine the mRNA levels of miR-137 and BCL11A in breast tissues and celllines. Bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter assay were used toverify the direct interaction between miR-137 and BCL11A. Afterup-/down-regulation of BCL11A, miR-137, or DNMT1 via lentiviral transduction inTNBC cell lines SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 cells, Q-PCR and Western blot assays wereused to detect the expression levels of BCL11A, DNA methyltransferases 1 (DNMT1),and Islet-1 (ISL1). Mammosphere assay was conducted to assess tumorosphereformation ability of cells, coupled with flow cytometry to determine thepercentage of breast cancer stem cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to determine the interaction between BCL11A and DNMT1. Xenograft tumorigenesis assaywas performed to monitor tumor formation in vivo.RESULTS: BCL11A was highly expressed in TNBC, whereas miR-137 was significantlylower in both TNBC tissues and cell lines. miR-137 suppressed BCL11A expressionat both mRNA and protein levels by directly targeting its 3'UTR. In both SUM149and MDA-MB-231 cells, overexpression of miR-137 or knockdown of BCL11A reducedthe number of tumoroshperes and the percentage of cancer stem cells in vitro, andinhibited tumor development in vivo. Furthermore, BCL11A interacted with DNMT1 inTNBC cells. Silencing of either BCL11A or DNMT1 impaired cancer stemness andtumorigenesis of TNBC via suppressing ISL1 expression both in vitro, and in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: By perturbing BCL11A-DNMT1 interaction, miR-137 impairs cancerstemness and suppresses tumor development in TNBC.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
