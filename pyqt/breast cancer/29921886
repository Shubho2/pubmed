Recent research shows that GRKs also interact with non-GPCRs and participate in signal transduction innon-phosphorylated manner. Besides, GRKs activity can be regulated by multiplefactors. Changes in GRKs expression have featured prominently in various tumorpathologies, and they are associated with angiogenesis, proliferation, migration,and invasion of malignant tumors. As a result, GRKs have been intensively studiedas potential therapeutic targets. Herein, we review evolving understanding of thefunction of GRKs, the regulation of GRKs activity and the role of GRKs in humanmalignant tumor pathophysiology.DOI: 10.1038/s41401-018-0049-z PMID: 29921886
