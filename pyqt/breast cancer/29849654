Complications can occur due to aberrant deposition ormigration of radiation microspheres into nontarget locations, including normalhepatic parenchyma, lungs, pancreas, and upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract. Wereport a case of gastric ulcers due to yttrium-90 (90Y) seed migration to thestomach to alert clinicians to this rare cause of gastric injury. A 57-year-oldwoman with stage IV breast cancer with liver and lung metastases presented to thehospital with 2 months of worsening nausea and vomiting. Two months prior, shehad received SIRT with 90Y microspheres without complications. Upper GI endoscopyshowed diffuse gastritis and extensive antral ulceration. Biopsies revealedblack, spherical foreign bodies, consistent with 90Y microspheres, documentingradiation injury. Radiation-induced UGI ulceration is caused by direct radiation injury from beta-radiation. Delay in diagnosis may be due to the nonspecificityof symptoms and temporal delay of symptom onset from SIRT, which was 2 months in our patient. Also, complaints may be attributed erroneously to adjuvantchemotherapy or widespread metastatic disease. Clinicians must considerradiation-associated toxicity in any SIRT-treated patient developing abdominalsymptoms.DOI: 10.1155/2018/1413724 PMCID: PMC5925165PMID: 29849654
