We therefore explored the association of high consumption of meat, milk,and whole grain products in adolescence and midlife, on breast cancer risk. Weused data from the population based AGES-Reykjavik cohort (2002-2006), where3,326 women with a mean age of 77 years (SD 6.0) participated. For food items andprincipal component derived dietary patterns we used Cox proportional models tocalculate multivariate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).During a mean follow-up of 8.8 years, 97 women were diagnosed with breast cancer.For both adolescence and midlife, daily consumption of rye bread was positivelyassociated with breast cancer (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6 and HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9,respectively). In contrast, persistent high consumption of oatmeal was negativelyassociated with breast cancer (0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9). No association was found forother food items or dietary patterns that included rye bread. High rye breadconsumption in adolescence and midlife may increase risk of late-life breastcancer whilst persistent consumption of oatmeal may reduce the risk.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198017 PMCID: PMC5976175PMID: 29847592
