The older survivors reportedlower levels of subjective stress and used more emotional control strategiescompared to the younger BCS. The empirical model had good fit indices(χ2 = 27.60, p = 0.20, χ2/df = 1.26; CFI = 0.98; TLI = 0.98; NFI = 0.95;RMSEA = 0.04 (90% CI = 0.00, 10) and showed that subjective stress, but notcoping strategies, mediated the effect of age on symptom cluster severity.CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of subjective stress, but not coping strategies,mediated the association of age with the symptom cluster of emotional distress,fatigue and cognitive difficulties. Further research is needed to exploredifferences in subjective stress by age.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.jgo.2018.05.002 PMID: 29759914
