We investigate the prognostic factors of recurrent events and deathafter a diagnosis of breast cancer and predict individual deaths including ahistory of recurrences.METHODS: The E3N (Etude Epidémiologique auprès de Femmes de la Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale) study is a prospective cohort study that was initiated in 1990 to investigate factors associated with the most common types of cancer.Overall survival and three types of recurrent events were considered:locoregional recurrence, metastasis, and second primary breast cancer. Recurrent events and death were analyzed using a joint frailty model.RESULTS: The analysis included 4926 women from the E3N cohort diagnosed with afirst primary invasive breast cancer between June 1990 and June 2008; during the follow-up, 1334 cases had a recurrence (median time of follow-up is 7.2 years)and 469 women died. Cases with high grade, large tumor size, axillary nodalinvolvement, and negative estrogen and progesterone receptors had a higher riskof recurrence or death. Furthermore, smoking increased the risk of relapse. Forcases with a medium risk profile in terms of tumor characteristics and lifestyle factors, the probability of dying between 5 and 10 years after diagnosis was 6,20 and 36% for 0, 1 or 2 recurrences within the first 5 years after diagnosis,respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the importance of considering baseline lifestylecharacteristics and history of relapses to dynamically predict the risk of death in breast cancer cases. Medical experience coupled with an estimate of apatient's survival probability that considers all available information for this patient would enable physicians to make better informed decisions regarding theiractions and thus improve clinical output.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4076-4 PMCID: PMC5807734PMID: 29426294
