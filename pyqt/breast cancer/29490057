[Epub ahead of print]Breast Cancer Risk Model Requirements for Counseling, Prevention, and Screening.Gail MH(1), Pfeiffer RM(1).Author information: (1)Biostatistics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NationalCancer Institute, Rockville, MD.Background: Incorporation of polygenic risk scores and mammographic density into models to predict breast cancer incidence can increase discriminatory accuracy(area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) from 0.6 formodels based only on epidemiologic factors to 0.7. It is timely to assess whatimpact these improvements will have on individual counseling and on public healthprevention and screening strategies, and to determine what further improvementsare needed.Methods: We studied various clinical and public health applications using alog-normal distribution of risk.Results: Provided they are well calibrated, even risk models with AUCs of 0.6 to 0.7 provide useful perspective for individual counseling and for weighing theharms and benefits of preventive interventions in the clinic. At the populationlevel, they are helpful for designing preventive intervention trials, forassessing reductions in absolute risk from reducing exposure to modifiable riskfactors, and for resource allocation (although a higher AUC would be desirablefor risk-based allocation). Other public health applications require higher AUCs that can only be achieved with risk predictors 1.6 to 8.8 times as strong as all those yet discovered combined. Such applications are preventing an appreciableproportion of population disease when employing a high-risk prevention strategyand deciding who should be screened for subclinical disease.Conclusions: Current and foreseeable risk models are useful for counseling andsome prevention activities, but given the daunting challenge of achieving, forexample, an AUC of 0.8, considerable effort should be put into finding effective preventive interventions and screening strategies with fewer adverse effects.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy013 PMID: 29490057
