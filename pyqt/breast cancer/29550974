Immunohistochemical analyses highlight ADAM9expression by actual cancer cells and associate its abundant presence withclinicopathological features such as shortened overall survival, poor tumorgrade, de-differentiation, therapy resistance, and metastasis formation. In each of these tumors, ADAM9 may contribute to tumor biology via proteolytic ornon-proteolytic mechanisms. For example, in liver cancer, ADAM9 has been found toshed MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A, contributing towards the evasionof tumor immunity. ADAM9 may also contribute to tumor biology in non-proteolytic ways probably through interaction with different integrins. For example, inmelanoma, the interaction between ADAM9 and β1 integrins facilitates tumor stromacross talks, which then promotes invasion and metastasis via the activation ofMMP1 and MMP2. In breast cancer, the interaction between β1 integrins onendothelial cells and ADAM9 on tumor cells facilitate tumor cell extravasationand invasion to distant sites. This review summarizes the present knowledge onADAM9 in solid cancers, and the different mechanisms which it employ to drivetumor progression.DOI: 10.1007/s00018-018-2796-x PMID: 29550974
