To address the discrepancies thathave arisen in the provision of these tests across the UK, the UK Cancer GeneticsGroup facilitated a 1-day workshop with representation from the majority ofNational Health Service (NHS) clinical genetics services. Using a preworkshopsurvey followed by focused discussion of genes without prior majority agreementfor inclusion, we achieved consensus for panels of cancer genes with sufficientevidence for clinical utility, to be adopted by all NHS genetics services. Tosupport consistency in the delivery of these tests and advice given to familiesacross the country, we also developed management proposals for individuals whoare found to have pathogenic mutations in these genes. However, we fullyacknowledge that the decision regarding what test is most appropriate for anindividual family rests with the clinician, and will depend on factors including specific phenotypic features and the family structure.Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
