China.Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a fatal, malignant tumor of the liver;effective diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ICC have not beenidentified yet. High expression of H2A histone family member Z (H2A.Z) is ahigh-risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer and primaryhepatocellular cancer. However, the significance of H2A.Z and its expression inICC remains unknown. The present study demonstrated that H2A.Z is overexpressedin ICC and expression of H2A.Z correlated with poor prognosis in patients withICC. H2A.Z regulated cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo via H2A.Z/S-phasekinase-associated protein 2/p27/p21 signaling. Inhibition of H2A.Z reduced cellproliferation and induced apoptosis in ICC. In addition, downregulation of H2AZreduced tumor metastasis by repressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition andenhanced the antitumor effects of cisplatin in the treatment of ICC. Overall,H2A.Z promoted cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ICC,suggesting that H2A.Z may be a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for ICC.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4292 PMCID: PMC5843396PMID: 29532867
