We isolated and identified, for the first time, eight flavonoids from T. kirilowii and found that three of them (IH: isorhamnetin, GN: genkwanin, and Aca: acacetin) inhibited cell proliferation in avariety of human cancer cell lines. These active flavonoids caused cell cyclearrest at G2/M phase and induced apoptosis and autophagy in human breast cancercells. Molecular docking revealed that these flavonoids dock in the ATP bindingpocket of PI3Kγ. Importantly, treatment with these flavonoids decreased thelevels of PI3Kγ-p110, phospho-PI3K, phospho-AKT, phospho-mTOR, phospho-p70S6K,and phospho-ULK. Pretreatment with PI3Kγ specific inhibitor AS605240 potentiated flavonoids-mediated inactivation of AKT, mTOR, p70S6K, ULK, and apoptosis. Taken together, these findings represent a novel mechanism by which downregulation ofPI3Kγ-p110 and consequent interruption of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K/ULK signalingpathway might play a critical functional role in these flavonoids-induced cellcycle arrest at G2/M phase, apoptosis, and autophagy. Our studies provide novelinsights into the anticancer activities of selected flavonoids and theirpotential uses in anticancer therapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29308-7 PMCID: PMC6062549PMID: 30050147
