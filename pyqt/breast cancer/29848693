Although everolimus has potent inhibitory effects on the mTOR pathway, it has demonstrated only modest clinical activity as a single agent.Whether long noncoding (lnc) RNA is involved in everolimus resistance is unknown.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability, colony formation and cell proliferationexperiments were used to measure the effects of long noncoding RNAN-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 2B-2 (lnc-ASAH2B-2) knockdown in BT474 and MCF7 breast cancer cells.RESULTS: lnc-ASAH2B-2 was up-regulated by everolimus in cells with and withoutserum, and reduction of lnc-ASAH2B-2 expression was able to inhibit proliferationof BT474 and MCF7 cells.CONCLUSION: lnc-ASAH2B-2 was up-regulated after everolimus exposure andefficiently regulated breast cancer cell growth by activating the mTOR pathway,which may reduce the effect of everolimus, providing evidence that lnc-ASAH2B-2might be a new therapeutic target for breast cancer.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12611 PMID: 29848693  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
