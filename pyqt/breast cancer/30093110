The aim of the current study is to explore theinvolvement of lncRNA snaR in ovarian carcinoma (OC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of lncRNA snaR and GRB2-associated bindingprotein 2 (GAB2) in plasma of both patients with OC and healthy females wasdetected by qRT-PCR. Application value of plasma lncRNA snaR in the diagnosis of OC was evaluated by ROC analysis. Correlation between plasma lncRNA snaR and GAB2was analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient. LncRNA snaR and GAB2 expression vectors as well as GAB2 siRNA were transfected into cells of human OC cell lines,and the effect on lncRNA snaR expression, GAB2 expression and cell proliferation was detected by qRT-PCR, western blot and CCK-8 assay.RESULTS: It was observed that plasma levels of lncRNA snaR and GAB2 weresignificantly higher in OC patients than those in healthy controls. In effect,high levels of plasma lncRNA snaR and GAB2 distinguished OC patients from healthycontrols. Plasma lncRNA snaR and GAB2 were positively correlated in OC patientsbut not in healthy controls. LncRNA snaR overexpression promoted cancer cellproliferation and upregulated GAB2 expression.CONCLUSIONS: GAB2 overexpression also promoted cancer cell proliferation butshowed no significant effects on lncRNA snaR expression, while GAB2 siRNAsilencing significantly attenuated the enhancing effects of lncRNA snaRoverexpression on cancer cell proliferation. LncRNA snaR may promoteproliferation of ovarian carcinoma cells by upregulating GAB2 expression.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.07.152 PMID: 30093110
