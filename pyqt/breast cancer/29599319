Aberrant expression of piRNA and PIWI proteins havebeen identified in various types of tumour cells. The aim of this study was toevaluate the expression profiles of PIWI-like protein-1, -2 (PIWIL1 and PIWIL2), their immunohistochemical (IHC) characteristics in ductal breast cancer, anddetermine their correlation with clinicopathological parameters of this type ofcancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Material for IHC studies comprised of 101 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cases and 31 mastopathy tissues. Frozen fragments of pairedtissue specimens (tumour and adjacent non-malignant breast tissue) taken from 55 patients with IDC and 18 samples of mastopathy were used for molecular studiesusing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).RESULTS: A statistically significantly higher level of PIWIL1 and PIWIL2 wasfound in IDC compared to mastopathy samples (p≤0.0001). Increased expression ofPIWIL1 was correlated with increased PIWIL2 expression in breast cancer tissue.Surprisingly, PIWIL1 mRNA was detected only in cancer and mastopathy, but was notfound in most normal breast tissues, although it is noteworthy that the PIWIL2mRNA level was statistically significantly lower in mastopathy and IDC samplescompared to normal breast tissues.CONCLUSION: Our results affirm the hypothesis that reactivation of PIWIexpression in various caner types is crucial for cancer development.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12441 PMID: 29599319  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
