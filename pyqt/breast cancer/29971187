We analyzed the incidence of suspicious axillary lymph nodesin gynecologic cancers.Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the positron emissiontomography/computed tomography findings of 251 patients with endometrial,cervical, and ovarian cancer. There is no cut-off value documented for axillarymetastases from gynecologic cancers; therefore we adopted the cut-offstandardized uptake values (SUVs) proclaimed in breast cancer.Results: A total of 251 patients records were available for analysis; 40 patients(15.9%) with suspicious axillary lymph nodes were included in the study.Twenty-one and a half percent (n=20/93) of patients with endometrium cancer,14.1% (n=14/99) of patients with ovarian cancer, and 10% (n=6/59) of those withcervical cancer had suspicious axillary lymph nodes. Patients with an maximum SUV(SUVmax) uptake higher than 3 underwent axillary lymph node biopsy. None of them was found to have axillary metastases of gynecologic cancers in the pathologicevaluation. In one patient with endometrial cancer, an obscure breast ductalcarcinoma was diagnosed, another patient with endometrial cancer was found tohave follicular lymphoma. The third patient with endometrial cancer had nomalignancy in axillary lymph node biopsy, but had Hurthle cell neoplasia in athyroid biopsy; the patient did not accept any surgical or medical treatment for endometrial cancer and died 23 months later. There were three (7.5%) metachronouscancers out of 40 gynecologic cancers; two patients were explained above, thethird patient with endometrium cancer, who was not histopathologically evaluated although the axillary SUVmax was <3, had rectosigmoid cancer and glioblastomametachronously.Conclusion: Our study shows that an important ratio (14-21%) of patients withgynecologic cancer has suspicious axillary lymph nodes. Increased SUVmax,particularly above 3, might be used as an indication for axillary biopsy and may help to identify secondary metastatic cancer.DOI: 10.4274/tjod.12144 PMCID: PMC6022426PMID: 29971187
