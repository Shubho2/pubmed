We analyzed data on 550 ER-positive breast cancer patients givenhypofractionated whole-breast radiotherapy from June 2009 to September 2016.Baseline comorbidities considered in the hypertension-augmented CharlsonComorbidity Index (hCCI) were retrospectively retrieved. Total hCCI scores wereclassified as no comorbidity (hCCI = 0), low burden of comorbidity (hCCI = 1),and high burden of comorbidity (hCCI ≥ 2). Competing risk analysis was used toestimate the 5-year cumulative incidence of HT discontinuation. Fine and Graymodels were used to estimate the adjusted subhazard ratio (SHR) of HTdiscontinuation by hCCI score. HT was initially prescribed for 85.6% of patients and almost all of them (468/471) took it for at least one month. It wassubsequently discontinued by 45 patients (9.6%), for an overall 5-year cumulativeincidence of 11.7%. The 5-year cumulative incidence of HT discontinuation rosefrom 3.9% in the youngest age group (65-69 years) to 23.3% in the oldest(≥ 80 years) (p = 0.005). Baseline comorbidity had some effect on the likelihood of discontinuing HT, but only among patients with a low burden of comorbidity(hCCI = 1, SHR 2.00, 95%CI 0.95-4.20). Adherence to HT was better in our samplethan in the literature, probably because patients were selected and motivated to continue HT. This confirms the importance of communication with patients toimprove adherence to HT. We confirmed the association between HT discontinuation and older age, while comorbidity had a limited influence.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1165-9 PMID: 29907919
