We hypothesized that an expression of NRP1 in breast cancer tissues is associated withclinicopathological data of patients and expression of the tumor suppressormiR-206.Patients and methods: We evaluated the expression of NRP1 in 48 invasive ductalcarcinomas of the breast and their corresponding adjacent noncancerous tissues(ANCTs) by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction. We also extracted dataon miR-206 gene expression from the same cohort of patients to evaluate thecorrelation between expression levels of miR-206 and NRP1. In addition, wequantified NRP1 protein levels using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assaytechnique.Results: No significant difference was found in NRP1 expression between tumoraltissues and ANCTs. We also assessed the associations between expression levels ofNRP1 and clinicopathological data of patients and found no significantassociations between NRP1 transcript levels and any characteristic. However, NRP1protein concentrations were significantly higher in patients with lymph nodeinvolvement compared with those without lymph node involvement. No correlationwas found between NRP1 and miR-206 expression levels.Conclusion: NRP1 protein levels might be an indicator of metastasis potential in breast cancer. Future studies are needed to confirm these results in largercohorts of patients.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S169533 PMCID: PMC6045910PMID: 30022855
