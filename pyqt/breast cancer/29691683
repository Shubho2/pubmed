The endogenous angiogenic inhibitor angiostatin contains the first 3-4 kringledomains of plasminogen and inhibits both angiogenesis and vascular permeability. We present here a 10-residue peptide, Angio-3, derived from plasminogen kringle3, which retains the functions of angiostatin in inhibiting both angiogenesis andvascular permeability. NMR studies indicate that Angio-3 holds a solutionstructure similar to the corresponding region of kringle 3. Mechanistically,Angio-3 inhibited both VEGF- and bFGF-induced angiogenesis by inhibiting ECproliferation and migration while inducing apoptosis. Inhibition of VEGF-induced vascular permeability results from its ability to impede VEGF-induceddissociation of adherens junction and tight junction proteins as well as theformation of actin stress fibers. When administered intravenously, Angio-3inhibited subcutaneous breast cancer and melanoma growth by suppressing bothtumor angiogenesis and intra-tumor vascular permeability. Hence, Angio-3 is anovel dual inhibitor of angiogenesis and vascular permeability. It is valuable asa lead peptide that can be further developed as therapeutics for diseasesinvolving excessive angiogenesis and/or vascular permeability.DOI: 10.1007/s10456-018-9616-7 PMID: 29691683
