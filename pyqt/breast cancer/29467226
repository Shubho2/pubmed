Recently, nonenzymatic RAS effectors (RASSF, RASassociation domain family) have garnered special attention because of theirtumor-suppressive properties in contrast to the oncogenic potential of theclassical enzymatic RAS effectors. Whereas most members of RASSF family arederegulated by promoter hypermethylation, RASSF8 promoter remains unmethylated inmany cancers but the mechanism(s) of its down-regulation remains unknown. Here,we unveil E4BP4 as a critical transcriptional modulator repressing RASSF8expression through histone methyltransferases, G9a and SUV39H1. In line withthese observations, we noticed a negative correlation of RASSF8 and E4BP4expression in primary breast tumor samples. In addition, our data provideevidence that E4BP4 attenuates RASSF8-mediated anti-proliferation and apoptosis, shedding mechanistic insights into RASSF8 down-regulation in breast cancers.Collectively, our study provides a better understanding on the epigeneticregulation of RASSF8 function and implicates the development of better treatment strategies.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.000623 PMCID: PMC5900760 [Available on 2019-04-13]PMID: 29467226
