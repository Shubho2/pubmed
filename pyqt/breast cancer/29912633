Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms remainrelatively unknown. ANXA2, highly expressed in invasive breast cancer cells, isclosely related with poor prognosis, and acts as a molecular switch to EGFRactivation. In this study, MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF7 cells were used. Our resultsshowed that ANXA2 expression is inversely correlated with cell sensitivity togefitinib. Knockdown of ANXA2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells increased thegefitinib induced cell death. When ANXA2 was overexpressed in MCF7 cells, thegefitinib induced cell death was decreased. Furthermore, we demonstrated thatphosphorylation of ANXA2 at Tyr23 is negatively correlated with the sensitivityof TNBC to gefitinib. Altogether, our results suggest a new role of ANXA2 inregulating sensitivity of TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib.DOI: 10.1080/09168451.2018.1484275 PMID: 29912633
