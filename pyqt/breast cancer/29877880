Biopsy showed invasive ductalcarcinoma. A PET/CT scan demonstrated hypermetabolism in the left breast andatypical heterogeneously increased uptake throughout the skeleton as well as aminimally FDG-avid right adrenal myelolipoma. PET/CT 4 months later after 6cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated increased size and FDG avidity ofthis adrenal mass concerning for metastasis and uniformly increased skeletal FDG avidity. Biopsy demonstrated adrenal myelolipoma. The growth and increased FDGavidity of the adrenal myelolipoma were due to the action of colony-stimulatingfactors on the tumor's hematopoietic component.DOI: 10.1097/RLU.0000000000002144 PMID: 29877880
