SNPs in FGFR2 are mostly identified. However, the association between PI3KCA SNP and breastcancer risk remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate thesignificance of FGFR2 and PI3KCA genetic variants in breast cancer and theirassociation with prognosis.Methods: We performed genotyping of 328 breast cancer patients and 389 healthycontrols. Then, we evaluated the associations of FGFR2 rs1219648 and PI3KCArs6443624 with the susceptibility and clinicopathological features of breastcancer. Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank test was performed to determine theprognostic values of FGFR2 rs1219648 and PI3KCA rs6443624.Results: The results indicated that genotype frequencies of rs1219648 andrs6443624 were significantly different between breast cancer patients and healthycontrols. Furthermore, PI3KCA rs6443624 A carriers and FGFR2 rs1219648 G carriersmore frequently had advanced stages and shorter survival times.Conclusion: The SNPs of FGFR2 rs1219648 and PI3KCA rs6443624 may contribute tothe identification of breast cancer patients at risk of more aggressive diseaseand may be potential prognostic factors in breast cancer in a Chinese population.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S164084 PMCID: PMC5973406PMID: 29872343
