However, intratumoral penetration of the nanoscalepoly(l-γ-glutamylglutamine)-paclitaxel conjugate (PGG-PTX) was still limited due to dysfunctional tumor blood vessels as well as high interstitial pressure in thetumor microenvironment.PURPOSE: The objective of the present research was to investigate the feasibilityof co-administration of a tumor penetration enhancing peptide tLyp-1 forimproving intratumoral accumulation and consequent anti-tumor efficacy ofPGG-PTX.METHODS: The influence of co-administration of tLyP-1 with PGG-PTX onintratumoral accumulation (via HPLC-MS/MS) and anti-tumor efficacy (by monitoringthe change in the tumor volume) was investigated using a breast cancer (4T1)tumor-bearing mouse model. In addition, the systemic toxicity ofco-administration of tLyP-1 with PGG-PTX was assessed by monitoring the change inthe animal body weight.RESULTS: It was observed that co-administration of tLyP-1 with PGG-PTXdramatically improved PGG-PTX accumulation in the tumors, resulting in improvedinhibition efficiency against tumor growth. Moreover, co-administration of tLyP-1with PGG-PTX did not change the systemic toxicity profile of PGG-PTX.CONCLUSION: Co-administration of tLyp-1 may be a promising strategy for improvingthe passive tumortargeting performance of polymeric drug conjugates.DOI: 10.1691/ph.2017.6096 PMID: 29441988
