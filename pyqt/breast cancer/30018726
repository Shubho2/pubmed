Weselected 289 newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer patients from June 2015 toJuly 2017. Ultrasound (US) guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNA) andcore-needle biopsy (CNB) was performed to identify patients with suspicioussentinel lymph node (SLN). Patients with a cortical thickness > 2 mm or atypical morphological characteristics were recommended FNA and CNB. Axillary lymph nodedissection (ALND) was applied to patients with biopsy-proven metastasis, andsentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was applied to FNA or CNB negative patients.ALND was also performed when SNB is positive. Out of 289 patients, only 131patients met final study criteria. Lymph node status was evaluated by FNA, CNB,SLND, and ALND. Among 131 patients, 45 were deemed positive for metastasis and 86were determined to be negative with CNB, whereas 38 were deemed positive formetastasis and 93 were determined to be negative by using FNAB. CNB was used tocorrectly identify seven axillae as positive for metastasis that were deemednegative by using FNAB. There were no positive FNAB results in axillae that were negative for metastasis with CNB. All patients underwent SLNB and those withbiopsy-proved axillary metastases were assigned directly to ALND as the primarystaging procedure. The final histopathologic assessment indicated that 50 (38.2%)of the 131 axillae studied had axillary LN metastases. Axillary US-guided CNB wasused to correctly identify 45 (90.0%) of the 50 LN-positive axillae, whereasaxillary US-guided FNAB was used to correctly identify 38 (76.0%, P < 0. 001).There were no false-positive results. CNB netted 5 false-negative results, andFNAB resulted in 12. There was significantly different accuracy between differentdiagnostic tools. In our study, we demonstrated that CNB is a more reliableapproach than FNA for the preoperative diagnosis of SLN metastasis.PMCID: PMC6038083PMID: 30018726
