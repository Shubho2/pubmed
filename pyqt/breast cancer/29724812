AlthoughEMT is well studied its regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, toidentify novel regulators of EMT, a data mining approach was taken usingpublished microarray data and a group of deubiquitinases (DUB) were found to beupregulated in cells that have undergone EMT. Here, it is demonstrated that oneDUB, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 11 (USP11), enhances TGFβ-induced EMT andself-renewal in immortalized human mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore,modulating USP11 expression in human breast cancer cells altered the migratorycapacity in vitro and metastasis in vivo Moreover, elevated USP11 expression inhuman breast cancer patient clinical specimens correlated with decreasedsurvival. Mechanistically, modulating USP11 expression altered the stability ofTGFβ receptor type II (TGFBR2) and TGFβ downstream signaling in human breastcancer cells. Together, these data suggest that deubiquitination of TGFBR2 byUSP11 effectively spares TGFBR2 from proteasomal degradation to promote EMT andmetastasis.Implications: USP11 regulates TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymalplasticity and human breast cancer metastasis and may be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.
