The objective of thisstudy was to develop a reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC)-UV method for simultaneous quantitative analysis of the triple-drug andtheir metabolites in plasma. RP-HPLC system with a C18 column and a diode arraydetector was employed. The plasma samples were precipitated with acetonitrile andthe supernatant was dried under a flow of nitrogen gas. The mobile phasecomprised of two combinations, water (pH 4.0) and methanol (98:2 v/v), and water (pH 4.0):methanol:acetonitrile (70:13:17 v/v/v). The retention times for thecompounds were determined and the parameters of validation established in plasma indicated the robustness and reliability. The corresponding HPLC peaks wereconfirmed using electron spray ionization mass spectrometry. FU and metaboliteshad a recovery of >93%; EP, epirubicinol and CP were >78% from plasma. Stability at 28-30°C in water (pH 4.0) of FU, 5,6-dihydro-5-fluorouracil and EP were higherfollowed by CP, EPol, fluorodeoxyuridine and fluorouridine (FUR). Storage of the drug-spiked plasma at -80°C assessed for 72 h showed a small but significant (P <0.05) change in the recovery of FUR and EP. The method was validated in patient'splasma samples (n = 6).DOI: 10.1093/chromsci/bmy020 PMID: 29608650  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
