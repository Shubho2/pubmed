Patients with clinical stage II or III TNBC scheduledfor neoadjuvant chemotherapy were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent four cycles of Adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), followed by four cycles of cisplatin or docetaxel chemotherapy and surgery. Blood samples were obtainedbefore the initial chemotherapy (baseline-CFD) and after four AC neoadjuvantchemotherapy cycles (AC-CFD) to evaluate CFD levels. In total, 72 patients whomet the inclusion criteria were enrolled. The mean baseline-CFD and AC-CFD levelswere 239 ± 68 and 210 ± 66 ng/mL, respectively, with a significant decline in theCFD levels after AC neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.001). In the 33.6-monthmedian follow-up, 18 cases of relapse were reported. A ROC curve analysis ofbaseline-CFD was performed to determine the predictive value for relapse, and an area under the curve of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.46-0.78) at 264 ng/mL was obtained.Patients with baseline-CFD >264 ng/mL were at a higher risk of relapse than thosewith baseline-CFD ≤264 ng/mL (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.11-7.24; P = 0.029).Multivariate analysis established baseline-CFD as an independent predictingfactor for relapse (HR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.32-10.53; P = 0.013). In conclusion,baseline-CFD measured by a fluorescence assay might be a potential biomarker topredict relapse, which could be useful for risk stratification of TNBC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23520 PMCID: PMC5790507PMID: 29423090
