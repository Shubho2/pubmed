China. lina@sdnu.edu.cn tangb@sdnu.edu.cn.Since microRNA-21 (miR-21) and protein programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) areimplicated in tumor progression, simultaneous monitoring of the dynamic variationof miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA in living cells is of great interest for understandingtheir relationship in the pathology of the disease. Herein, a versatile nanoprobebased on graphene oxide (GO) and DNA was prepared which can simultaneouslymonitor and visualize miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA in living cells. In vitro experimentsdemonstrate that the nanoprobe exhibits outstanding selectivity and highsensitivity towards miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA. Moreover, by exploiting the DNA/GOsensing platform, simultaneous imaging of miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA in MCF-7 humanbreast cancer cells has been realized. More significantly, an inverse correlationbetween miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA was verified by fluorescence confocal imaging andRT-PCR results, indicating the distinguishing ability of the nanoprobe at variousexpression levels of RNAs. The current strategy provides a promising tool toimplement the detection of miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA in cancer cells and can beexpected to be applied for other biomolecular sensing.DOI: 10.1039/c8nr04106g PMID: 30010689
