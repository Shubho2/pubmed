Six subscales out of the nine met the standards ofreliability with coefficients ranging from 0.55 to 0.89. The mean score of allfunctioning scales was high >55. Advanced breast cancer stages of III-IV hadhigher symptomatic scores significantly than those in early stages for thephysical function, cognitive, fatigue, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, andfinancial difficulties. Correlation coefficients between each item ranged from-0.113 to 0.960, and item 21 (tense) and item 23 (irritable) had strongestnegative correlations with their corresponding emotional functioning subscale,whereas items 29 (physical condition) and 30 (overall QoL) had the strongestpositive correlation with Global Health/QoL subscale. Item 6 (limited work)showed a higher correlation with fatigue (r = 0.749). Likewise, item 19 (paininterfered with daily activities) of the pain subscale had higher correlationswith physical functioning, role functioning, and fatigue subscales.Conclusion: Qatari Arabic version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 showed acceptablepsychometric properties, which is a reliable and valid instrument, that can beused by oncologists.DOI: 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_17_17 PMCID: PMC5848406PMID: 29564271
