We investigated the effect ofpregabalin and duloxetine on QOL of breast cancer patients who experienced TIPN.Materials and Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind clinical trialconducted at a chemotherapy center of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. Breast cancer patients 18 or more years old were included if theyreceived paclitaxel or docetaxel and experienced neuropathy grade one or higher; and neuropathic pain score of four or more. Patients were treated with pregabalinor duloxetine until 6 weeks. Assessment of sensory neuropathy and QOL wasperformed at baseline, and 6 weeks after the initiation of the treatment.Results: At baseline, the mean score of global health status/QOL scale forpregabalin and duloxetine groups were 61 (standard deviation [SD]; 5.11) and60.28 (SD; 5.44), respectively (P = 0.54). After 6 weeks, both interventions wereassociated with improvement of global QOL compared to baseline. The global healthstatus/QOL score was not different between two groups after 6 weeks. While theemotional functioning was improved more favorably with duloxetine (P < 0.001);pregabalin was associated with more improvement in insomnia and pain scores (P = 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively).Conclusion: Pregabalin as well as duloxetine improve the global QOL of breastcancer patients with TIPN. Different effects of treatments on subscale of QLQ-C30could help clinicians to select the appropriate agent individually.DOI: 10.4103/jrms.JRMS_1068_17 PMCID: PMC6040148PMID: 30057636
