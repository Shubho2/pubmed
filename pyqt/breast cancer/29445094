Survivors self-reported QOL was measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 andthe QLQ-BR23. The impact of BMI on QOL was examined through standard leastsquares regression. Normal weight and overweight survivors were more likely tohave a better QOL than underweight and obese survivors and the results weresimilar to survivors diagnosed as having chronic diseases. After adjustment forclinical and sociodemographic factors, the QOL increased with increasing BMI inbreast cancer survivors ranged from underweight to overweight with no chronicdiseases, especially in the scales of emotional function and fatigue. Obesebreast cancer survivors reported a significantly worse QOL compared to normalweight and overweight breast cancer survivors. Within breast cancer survivorswith one or more chronic diseases, it was more obvious that overweight ones had asignificantly better QOL with clear evidence of a dose relationship acrossunderweight to overweight in almost all scales. Unlike obese breast cancersurvivors without chronic diseases, the ones with chronic disease(s) had asimilar QOL compared to normal weight breast cancer survivors in all scalesexcept in the domain of fatigue.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-20392-3 PMCID: PMC5813090PMID: 29445094
