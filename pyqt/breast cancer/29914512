Migration/invasion and proliferation abilities were compared between breast cancer cells that were cultivated alone and those co-cultivated withmature adipocytes. The ability of lipolysis in breast cancer cells were measured,as well as the expression of the rate-limiting lipase ATGL and fatty acidtransporter FABP5. ATGL and FABP5 were then ablated to investigate their impacton the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells that were surrounded by adipocytes. Further, immunohistochemistry was performed to detect differential expression of ATGL and FABP5 in breast cancer tissue sections.RESULTS: The migration and invasion abilities of cancer cells were significantly enhanced after co-culture with adipocytes, accompanied by elevated lipolysis and expression of ATGL and FABP5. Abrogation of ATGL and FABP5 sharply attenuated themalignancy of co-cultivated breast cancer cells. However, this phenomenon was notobserved if a lipid emulsion was added to the culture medium to substitute foradipocytes. Furthermore, epithelial-mesenchymal transaction was induced inco-cultivated breast cancer cells. That may partially due to the stimulation ofPPARβ/δ and MAPK, which was resulted from upregulation of FABP5. As evidenced by immunohistochemistry, ATGL and FABP5 also had higher expression levels at theinvasive front of the breast tumor, in where the adipocytes abound, compared tothe central area in tissue specimens.CONCLUSIONS: Lipid originating from tumor-surrounding adipocytes could betransferred into breast cancer cells. Adipocyte-cancer cell crosstalk rather thanlipids alone induced upregulation of lipases and fatty acid transport protein in cancer cells to utilize stored lipids for tumor progression. The increasedexpression of the key lipase ATGL and intracellular fatty acid traffickingprotein FABP5 played crucial roles in this process via fueling or signaling.DOI: 10.1186/s12964-018-0221-6 PMCID: PMC6006729PMID: 29914512
