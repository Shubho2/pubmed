This newly developed copolymer was fullycharacterized by FT-IR, 1HNMR and 13CNMR spectroscopy. Micellization of thecopolymer was performed by dialysis membrane method and obtained micelles werecharacterized by FESEM, dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential (ξ), andcritical micelle concentration (CMC) measurements. This copolymer was developedwith the aim of co-delivering two different anticancer drugs: methotrexate (MTX) and chrysin. In vitro cytotoxicity effect of MTX@Chrysin-loadedP(HEMA-LA-MADQUAT) was also studied through assessing the survival rate of breastcancer cell line (MCF-7) and DAPI staining assays. Cationic micelle (and surface charge of + 7.6) with spherical morphology and an average diameter of 55 nm andCMC of 0.023 gL-1 was successfully obtained. Micelles showed the drug loadedcapacity around 87.6 and 86.5% for MTX and Chrysin, respectively. Thecytotoxicity assay of a drug-free nanocarrier on MCF-7 cell lines indicated that this developed micelles were suitable nanocarriers for anticancer drugs.Furthermore, the MTX@Chrysin-loaded micelle had more efficient anticancerperformance than free dual anticancer drugs (MTX @ chrysin), confirmed by MTTassay and DAPI stainingmethods. Therefore, we envision that this recentlydeveloped novel micelle can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents, MTX and Chrysin, combination chemotherapy and has the potential to be used as ananticancer drug delivery system for in vivo studies.
