These master-regulatory functions of ERα requiretrans-acting elements such as the pioneer factor FOXA1 to establish a genomiclandscape conducive to ERα control. Here, we identify the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2C as necessary for hormone-driven ERα activity and breast cancerproliferation. KMT2C knockdown suppresses estrogen-dependent gene expression and causes H3K4me1 and H3K27ac loss selectively at ERα enhancers. Correspondingly,KMT2C loss impairs estrogen-driven breast cancer proliferation but has no effect on ER- breast cells. Whereas KMT2C loss disrupts estrogen-driven proliferation,it conversely promotes tumor outgrowth under hormone-depleted conditions. Inaccordance, KMT2C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in ER-positivebreast cancer with KMT2C deletion correlating with significantly shorterprogression-free survival on anti-estrogen therapy. From a therapeuticstandpoint, KMT2C-depleted cells that develop hormone-independence retain theirdependence on ERα, displaying ongoing sensitivity to ERα antagonists. We concludethat KMT2C is a key regulator of ERα activity whose loss uncouples breast cancer proliferation from hormone abundance.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0273-5 PMID: 29755131
