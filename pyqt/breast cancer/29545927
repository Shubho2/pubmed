Associated with the rare developmentaldisorder Adams-Oliver Syndrome (AOS), CdGAP is critical for embryonic vasculardevelopment and VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. Moreover, CdGAP is an essentialcomponent in the synergistic interaction between TGFβ and ErbB-2 signalingpathways during breast cancer cell migration and invasion, and is a novelE-cadherin transcriptional co-repressor with Zeb2 in breast cancer. CdGAP ishighly phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in response to growthfactors and is a substrate of ERK1/2 and GSK-3. Here, we identified Ser1093 andSer1163 in the C-terminal region of CdGAP, which are phosphorylated by RSK inresponse to phorbol ester. These phospho-residues create docking sites forbinding to 14-3-3 adaptor proteins. The interaction between CdGAP and 14-3-3proteins inhibits the GAP activity of CdGAP and sequesters CdGAP into thecytoplasm. Consequently, the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of CdGAP is inhibitedand CdGAP-induced cell rounding is abolished. In addition, 14-3-3β inhibits theability of CdGAP to repress the E-cadherin promoter and to induce cell migration.Finally, we show that 14-3-3β is unable to regulate the activity and subcellular localization of the AOS-related mutant proteins lacking these phospho-residues.Altogether, we provide a novel mechanism of regulation of CdGAP activity andlocalization, which impacts directly on a better understanding of the role ofCdGAP as a promoter of breast cancer and in the molecular causes of AOS.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24126 PMCID: PMC5837747PMID: 29545927
