This study aims to investigate how to optimally develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme of CEDM images to classify breast masses.A CEDM dataset of 111 patients was assembled, which includes 33 benign and 78malignant cases. Each CEDM includes two types of images namely, low energy (LE)and dual-energy subtracted (DES) images. A CAD scheme was applied to segment massregions depicting on LE and DES images separately. Optimal segmentation resultsgenerated from DES images were also mapped to LE images or vice versa. Aftercomputing image features, multilayer perceptron based machine learningclassifiers that integrate with a correlation-based feature subset evaluator and leave-one-case-out cross-validation method were built to classify mass regions.When applying CAD to DES and LE images with original segmentation, areas underROC curves (AUC) were 0.759 ± 0.053 and 0.753 ± 0.047, respectively. Aftermapping the mass regions optimally segmented on DES images to LE images, AUCsignificantly increased to 0.848 ± 0.038 (p < 0.01). Study demonstrated that DES images eliminated overlapping effect of dense breast tissue, which helps improve mass segmentation accuracy. The study demonstrated that applying a novel approachto optimally map mass region segmented from DES images to LE images enabled CADto yield significantly improved performance.DOI: 10.1007/s10439-018-2044-4 PMID: 29748869
