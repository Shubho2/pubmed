Here, two-photon microscopy was employed to detect morphological alterations in breast cancer progression and recession throughout chemotherapy. The changes instructure were analyzed based on the autofluorescence and collagen of differingstatuses. Parameters, including optical redox ratio, the ratio of second harmonicgeneration and auto-fluorescence signal, collagen density, and collagen shapeorientation, were studied. Results indicate that these parameters are potentialindicators for evaluating breast tumors and their microenvironment changes duringprogression and chemotherapy. Combined analyses of these parameters could providea quantitative, novel method for monitoring tumor therapy.DOI: 10.1364/BOE.9.001375 PMCID: PMC5846538PMID: 29541528
