Our purpose was to estimate the extent to which patients engaged in mammography underwent otheradditional imaging- and non-imaging-based preventative health services usingCenters for Disease Control National Population Health Surveys.METHODS: Women aged 40 to 74 in the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor SurveillanceSystem cross-sectional survey without histories of breast cancer who reportedhaving a mammogram within the past 2 years were included. Adherence torecommended preventative services was based on US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations, relative to the time at which the survey participant respondedto the survey. Among women reporting being engaged in mammography, proportions ofeligible women obtaining recommended preventative health services were calculatedand stratified by demographics.RESULTS: Of 172,245 women, 122,434 (71.1%) reported mammography within 2 years.The following percentages obtained recommended flu vaccines (49.2%), pneumococcalvaccines (69.5%), colorectal cancer screening (74.8%), and Papanicolaou test(93.2%). Women reporting mammography within the last 2 years with lower levels ofeducation and income and who lacked health insurance or personal doctors wereless likely to report receiving recommended preventative services (P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: National population-based survey results suggest that largeproportions of women engaged in mammography report are not up to date with a widevariety of recommended preventative health services, suggesting ampleopportunities for radiology practices to partner with providers to improvepopulation-based health outcomes and add value to health care systems.Copyright Â© 2018 American College of Radiology.
