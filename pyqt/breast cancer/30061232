In vitro drug release studiesshowed that the hydrogel can prolong the release of doxorubicin by several weeks (51.5%±5.3% at 21 days). In addition, in vivo scintigraphy results suggested highretention rates (43.1%±1.0% at 48 h) of the radiopharmaceutical compound at thetumor injection site.CONCLUSION: The preliminary results indicated that the C/GP/GE/188Re-LIPO-DOXradiopharmaceutical hydrogel is a potential candidate for further in vivotherapeutic evaluation.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12770 PMID: 30061232  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
