[Epub ahead of print]Targeting Cdc42 with the anticancer compound MBQ-167 inhibits cell polarity andgrowth in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae.Rivera-Robles MJ(1), Medina-Velázquez J(1), Asencio-Torres GM(1), González-CrespoS(1), Rymond BC(2), Rodríguez-Medina J(1), Dharmawardhane S(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Biochemistry , School of Medicine, University of Puerto RicoMedical Sciences Campus , San Juan , USA.(2)b Department of Biology , University of Kentucky , Lexington , USA.The Rho GTPase Cdc42 is highly conserved in structure and function. Mechanical orchemical cues in the microenvironment stimulate the localized activation of Cdc42to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton and establish cell polarity. A role for Cdc42in cell polarization was first discovered in the budding yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae, and subsequently shown to also regulate directional motility inanimal cells. Accordingly, in cancer Cdc42 promotes migration, invasion, andspread of tumor cells. Therefore, we targeted Cdc42 as a therapeutic strategy to treat metastatic breast cancer and designed the small molecule MBQ-167 as apotent inhibitor against Cdc42 and the homolog Rac. MBQ-167 inhibited cancer cellproliferation and migration in-vitro, and tumor growth and spread in-vivo in amouse xenograft model of metastatic breast cancer. Since haploid budding yeastexpress a single Cdc42 gene, and do not express Rac, we used this wellcharacterized model of polarization to define the contribution of Cdc42inhibition to the effects of MBQ-167 in eukaryotic cells. Growth, buddingpattern, and Cdc42 activity was determined in wildtype yeast or cells expressing a conditional knockdown of Cdc42 in response to vehicle or MBQ-167 treatment. As expected, growth and budding polarity were reduced by knocking-down Cdc42, with aparallel effect observed with MBQ-167. Cdc42 activity assays confirmed thatMBQ-167 inhibits Cdc42 activation in yeast, and thus, bud polarity. Hence, wehave validated MBQ-167 as a Cdc42 inhibitor in another biological context andpresent a method to screen Cdc42 inhibitors with potential as anti-metastaticcancer drugs.DOI: 10.1080/21541248.2018.1495008 PMID: 29969362
