For thestructure-activity relationships, the importance of 1,2,3-triazole andsubstituents on phenyl ring was explored. Among thesephenothiazine-1,2,3-triazole hybrids, compound 9f showed the most potentinhibitory effect against MCF-7 cells, with an IC50 value of 0.8 Î¼M. Importantly,compound 9f could induce apoptosis against MCF-7 cells by regulatingapoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, Bad, Parp, and DR5). These potentphenothiazine-1,2,3-triazole hybrids as novel apoptosis inducers might be used asantitumor agents in the future.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23061288 PMID: 29843370
