But, these results wereinconsistent. This meta-analysis based on 18 studies involving 13,716 cancerpatients and 15,590 cancer-free controls is aimed at to evaluate the relationshipbetween the four common SNPs of BRIP1 (rs2048718, rs4988344, rs4986764, andrs6504074) and cancer risk. The results showed a decreased risk of rs2048718 orrs4986764 for cervical cancer rather than breast cancer in the overall population(P < 0.05). However, rs6504074 was associated with gynecologic cancer risk among overall population (P < 0.05). Further stratification analyses by ethnicityindicated that all 4 polymorphisms (rs2048718, rs4988344, rs4986764, andrs6504074) were strongly related to cancer susceptibility in Chinese people (P < 0.05). This meta-analysis showed that rs6504074 may play a decreased risk ofgynecologic cancer in the overall population. Rs4988344, rs4986764, and rs6504074were significantly related to decreasing cancer risk in Chinese population.DOI: 10.18632/aging.101388 PMCID: PMC5842853PMID: 29466248
