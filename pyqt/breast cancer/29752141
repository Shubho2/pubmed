Data from 437 breast and 660prostate cancer survivors were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression wasconstructed to evaluate variables from baseline MHOS with relation to falls from follow-up MHOS. Model accuracy was assessed using area underreceiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC).RESULTS: At follow-up MHOS, 26% of breast and 22% of prostate cancer survivorsreported falls in the past 12 months. In breast cancer, a history of falls (odds ratio (OR) = 4.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.44-10.04) and sensoryimpairment in feet (OR = 3.33, 95%CI = 1.51-7.32) were significant predictors of falls. In prostate cancer, a history of falls (OR = 3.04, 95%CI = 1.79-5.15),unmarried (OR = 1.82, 95%CI = 1.12-2.95), lower physical summary score ofquality-of-life(OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.94-0.98), urinary incontinence (OR = 1.69,95%CI = 1.08-2.65), older age at diagnosis (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.01-1.09), andshorter time post-diagnosis (OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.93-0.99) were significantpredictors of falls. AUC was 0.67 and 0.77 for breast and prostate cancer,respectively, indicating moderate accuracy of models in detecting fallers.CONCLUSIONS: Asking older breast and prostate cancer survivors about falls in thepast 12 months is imperative in fall prevention. Further examination of deficits specific to each cancer is necessary to assess fall risks.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.jgo.2018.04.009 PMID: 29752141
