Email: bazrafshan.a.83@gmail.comIntroduction: The epidemiology of common cancers in Kerman province, southeast ofIran, was assessed based upon results of the Kerman Population-Based CancerRegistry Program (KPBCR). Methods: in this retrospective study, all patientsdiagnosed with primary cancers and registered with the KPBCR were included. Newcancer cases registered from 2014 were identified from pathological labs, medicalreports of 48 health facilities providing cancer diagnosis or treatment services and the national death registry program. Data for patients who were referred toneighboring provinces to access health services were also collected from nationalreferral registries. Results from autopsies was additionally extracted fromregional forensic and legal medicine centers and added to the registryperiodically. Age standardized incidence rates (ASRs) per 100,000 person-yearsfor all cancers were computed, using direct-standardization and CanRegmethodology. Mortality to incidence (M:I) ratios and microscopically verified(MV) proportions were calculated as quality measures. Results: A total of 2,838cases of cancer were registered in Kerman province, 2014. Of these 45. 6%involved women (n=1,293). Individuals aged 60-64 years represented the largestproportion (11.6%) of the total cancer prevalence, followed by those aged 55-59years (10.86%) and 65-69 years (8.99%). The ASRs for all cancers were 155.1 and118.90 per 100,000, in men and women, respectively. In women, breast (ASR: 26.4),skin (ASR: 13.0), thyroid (ASR: 9.2), leukemia (ASR: 8.0) and colorectal (ASR:7.70) were the most common cancers. In men, bladder (ASR: 24.70), skin (ASR:16.80), lung (ASR: 14.6), leukemia (ASR: 14.50), and stomach (ASR: 10.8) werefound to be the most frequent. Conclusion: This study provided latest evidence onepidemiology of cancer in the southeast of Iran that could be used to empowerprevention and control interventions in a developing country.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.6.1533 PMID: 29936728
