We retrospectively evaluated the histological, clinical, andmammographic features of 69 cases from 65 women, with directional vacuum-assistedbiopsy-diagnosed flat epithelial atypia with or without atypical ductalhyperplasia or atypical lobular hyperplasia, which underwent subsequent surgical excision. The extent and percentage of microcalcifications sampled by directionalvacuum-assisted biopsy were evaluated by mammography. All biopsy and surgicalexcision slides were reviewed. The age of the women ranged from 40 to 85 years(mean 57 years). All patients presented with mammographically detectedmicrocalcifications only, except in one case that had associated architecturaldistortion. Extent of calcifications ranged from <1 cm (n = 47), 1-3 cm (n = 15) to > 3 cm (n = 6), and no measurement (n = 1). A mean of 11 cores (range 6-25)was obtained from each lesion. Post-biopsy mammogram revealed >90% removal ofcalcifications in 81% of cases. Pure flat epithelial atypia represented nearlytwo-thirds of directional vacuum-assisted biopsy specimens (n = 43, 62%), whileflat epithelial atypia coexisted with atypical ductal hyperplasia (18 cases,26%), or atypical lobular hyperplasia (8 cases, 12%). Upon excision, none of the cases were upgraded to in situ ductal or invasive breast cancer. In one case,however, an incidental, tubular carcinoma (4 mm) was found away from biopsy site.Excluding this case, the upgrade rate was 0%. Our study adds to the growingevidence that diagnosis of flat epithelial atypia on directional vacuum-assisted biopsy for microcalcifications as the only imaging finding is not associated witha significant upgrade to carcinoma on excision, and therefore, excision may notbe necessary. Additionally, excision may not be necessary for flat epithelialatypia with atypical ductal hyperplasia limited to ≤2 terminal duct-lobularunits, if at least 90% of calcifications have been removed on biopsy.DOI: 10.1038/s41379-018-0035-5 PMID: 29467479
