PI3-Kinase (PI3K), a key oncogene involved in a wide variety ofcancers, drives AKT activity. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway hasbeen associated with tumorigenic properties including uncontrolled cellproliferation and survival, angiogenesis, promotion of cellular motility,invasiveness and metastasis. However, AKT1 activity has also been recently shown to repress the invasive properties of breast cancer cells in specific contexts.METHODS: This study used both pharmacological and shRNA approaches to inhibit AKTfunction, microscopy to characterize the cellular morphology, 3D spheroid models to assess migratory and invasive cellular capacities and a phenotypic screeningapproach based on electrical properties of the cells.RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that the alternative action of AKT1 on invasiveproperties of breast cancers can be extended to head and neck carcinomas, whichexhibit constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Indeed, inhibition ofAKT1 function by shRNA or a specific pharmacological inhibitor resulted incellular spreading and an invasive phenotype. A phenotypic screening approachbased on cellular electrical properties corroborated microscopic observations andprovides a foundation for future high-throughput screening studies. Thistechnique further showed that the inhibition of AKT1 signaling is phenocopied by blocking the mTORC1 pathway with rapamycin.CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the repressive action of PI3K/AKT1 oncellular invasive properties may be a mechanism common to several cancers.Current and future studies involving AKT inhibitors must therefore consider this property to prevent metastases and consequently to improve survival.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4169-0 PMCID: PMC5836445PMID: 29506489
