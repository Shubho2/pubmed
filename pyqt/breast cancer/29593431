Our objectivewas to investigate whether concomitant DCIS affects survival outcomes in patientswith IDC.Materials and methods: Patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer who underwentsurgery in 2010-2014 were included from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and EndResults program. Statistical analyses were conducted using χ2 test,linear-by-linear association, one-way analysis of variance, Kaplan-Meier method, Cox proportional hazards regression model, and propensity score matching (PSM).Results: A total of 61,745 patients were identified, including 44,630 (72.3%),13,559 (22.0%), and 3,556 (5.7%) patients with no DCIS component reported(No-DCIS), DCIS <25% (L-DCIS), and ≥25% (H-DCIS), respectively. Patients withH-DCIS were more likely to be younger (p<0.001), have smaller tumors (p<0.001),good/moderate differentiation (p<0.001), human epidermal growth factor receptor2-positive disease (p<0.001), receive mastectomy (p<0.001), and not receiveradiotherapy (p<0.001) and chemotherapy (p<0.001). The median follow-up was 27months, and the 2-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) in patients withNo-DCIS, L-DCIS, and H-DCIS was 97.3%, 98.0%, and 98.5%, respectively (p<0.001). Before PSM, H-DCIS was an independent favorable prognostic factor for BCSS;patients with H-DCIS had better BCSS compared to patients with No-DCIS (hazardratio [HR] 0.674, 95% CI: 0.528-0.861, p=0.002), while the BCSS between No-DCISand L-DCIS was similar (HR 0.944, 95% CI: 0.840-1.061, p=0.334). However, thissurvival advantage disappeared after PSM; there was significantly different BCSS between patients with No-DCIS and H-DCIS (HR 0.923, 95% CI: 0.653-1.304,p=0.650). H-DCIS was not associated with BCSS as compared to No-DCIS in thebreast-conserving surgery (p=0.295) and mastectomy (p=0.793) groups.Conclusion: In breast cancer, patients with H-DCIS have unique clinicopathologic features compared to patients with No-DCIS. Before PSM, H-DCIS was associatedwith favorable BCSS as compared to No-DCIS. However, the survival advantagedisappeared after PSM.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S154656 PMCID: PMC5865571PMID: 29593431
