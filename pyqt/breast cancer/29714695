126. Gen Dent. 2018 May-Jun;66(3):18-24.The role of dental care providers in the management of patients prescribedbisphosphonates: brief clinical guidance.Abed HH, Al-Sahafi EN.Dental care providers are likely to see patients who take bisphosphonates forvarious medical conditions, including osteoporosis, bony metastatic tumors,multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Bisphosphonates accumulate in areas of high bone turnover, leading to suppression of bone turnover and theaging of keratocytes. These adverse effects predispose the maxillary andmandibular bone to development of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw(MRONJ), specifically among oncology patients treated with intravenousbisphosphonate therapy. Studies have shown that stopping bisphosphonate therapy, temporarily (drug holiday) or permanently, is not significantly effective. Theeffectiveness of a drug holiday is likely limited due to the pharmacologicactivity of bisphosphonates and their persistent, long-term effect on bone.Therefore, patients should not be discouraged from taking bisphosphonates for an existing medical condition. A dental health assessment by an oral surgeon, adental specialist, or a well-trained general dental practitioner is highlyrecommended prior to treatment with bisphosphonate. The evaluating clinician mustattempt to eliminate or mitigate risk factors to prevent the development ofMRONJ. It is crucial for dental care providers to recognize the clinical signsand symptoms of MRONJ, including its radiographic appearance. In cases of anysuspicious oral lesion, early referral to an oral surgeon is crucial. It isbetter to avoid dental extractions during the active period of treatment and totreat the tooth carefully with nonsurgical root canal treatment instead. Thisreview provides brief clinical guidance for dental care providers regardingmanagement of patients prescribed bisphosphonates and ways to help minimizepatients' risk of developing MRONJ.PMID: 29714695
