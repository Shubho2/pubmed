We sought to determine the impact ofguideline publication on clinician practice.METHODS: A total of 3081 members of the American Society of Breast Surgeons(ASBrS) received a survey. Respondents' clinical practice type and duration,guideline familiarity, and margin width preferences before and after publication were assessed. Clinical practice pattern differences before and after publicationwere investigated using McNemar's test.RESULTS: A total of 767 (24.9%) of those surveyed responded. Most (92.4%)indicated guideline familiarity. Of those familiar, re-excision preference forDCIS and a positive margin remained the same before (94.4%) and after (94.3%)publication (McNemar's test p = 1.0). Following publication, surgeons were morelikely to avoid re-excision to achieve margins wider than 2-mm (82.3% pre versus 87.5% post, p = 0.002). More surgeons performed re-excision for a close marginwith pure DCIS (25.9% pre versus 36.5% post, p < 0.001) and with DCIS withmicroinvasion (DCIS-M) (40.7% pre versus 52.3% post, p < 0.001). For patientswith invasive disease with extensive intraductal component (EIC) and a closemargin, preference to avoid re-excision was similar (51.2% per versus 55.2% post,p = 0.071).CONCLUSION: Since guideline publication, surgeons are less likely to performre-excision to obtain a margin greater than 2-mm and more likely to performre-excision to obtain a 2-mm margin for both pure DCIS and DCIS-M. Preference to avoid re-excision with a close margin and EIC was similar before and afterpublication.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6580-9 PMID: 29987598
