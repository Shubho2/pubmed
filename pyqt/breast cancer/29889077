The Huntingtin gene (HTT) carries a polymorphic trinucleotideexpansion of CAGs in exon 1 that ranges from 9 to 35 in the non-HD affectedpopulation. However, if it exceeds 35 CAG repeats, the altered protein isreferred to as mutant HTT and leads to the development of HD. Given the widespectrum of severe symptoms developed by HD individuals, wild-type and mutant HTThave been mostly studied in the context of this disorder. However, HTT expressionis ubiquitous and several peripheral symptoms in HD have been described,suggesting that HTT is of importance, not only in the central nervous system(CNS), but also in peripheral organs. Accordingly, HTT and mutant HTT mayinterfere with non-brain-related diseases. Correlative studies have highlighted adecreased cancer incidence in the HD population and both wild-type and mutant HTThave been implicated in tumor progression. In this review, we describe thecurrent evidence linking wild-type and mutant HTT to cancer and discuss how CAGpolymorphism, HTT function, and partners may influence carcinogenesis andmetastatic progression.DOI: 10.3233/JHD-180290 PMID: 29889077
