Diffusion-weightedimaging (DWI) is a sequence variation introduced as a complementary MRI techniquethat relies on mapping the diffusion process of water molecules thereby providingadditional information about the underlying tissue. Since water diffusion is morerestricted in most malignant tumors than in benign ones owing to the highercellularity of the rapidly proliferating neoplasia, DWI has the potential tocontribute to the identification and characterization of suspicious breastlesions. Thus, DWI might increase the diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI and itsclinical value. Future applications including optimized DWI sequences, technical developments in MR devices, and the application of radiomics/artificialintelligence algorithms may expand the potential of DWI in breast imaging beyond its current supplementary role.DOI: 10.1007/s00117-018-0423-3 PMID: 30003283
