China.Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are able to suppress breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by altering the expression of estrogen receptor (ER),progesterone receptor (PR) or human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 (Her2/neu). Since HDACis can alter the expression of various microRNAs(miRNAs/miRs), the present study aimed to examine the role of miRNAs in theeffects of HDACis on breast cancer cells. We first examined the mRNA expressionof ER, PR, and Her2/neu using RT-PCR and the protein levels of ER, PR, andHer2/neu using western blot analysis in MDA-MB-231 and BT474 cells, aftertrichostatin A (TSA) or vorinostat (SAHA) treatment. We then conducted miRNAexpression profiling using microarrays after BT474 cells were treated with TSA orSAHA. Finally, we examined the effects of synthetic miR-762 and miR-642a-3pinhibitors on SAHA-induced downregulation of Her2/neu and SAHA-induced apoptosis and PARP cleavage in BT474 cells. The results indicated that TSA and SAHAdose‑dependently enhanced the mRNA and protein expression levels of ER and PR in MDA‑MB‑231 and BT474 cells. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of Her2/neuwere reduced in MDA‑MB‑231 cells, and the mRNA and protein expression levels ofHer2/neu were reduced in BT474 cells in response to SAHA and TSA. Furthermore,treatment with TSA (0.2 µM) or SAHA (5.0 µM) induced a marked alteration in theexpression of various miRNAs in BT474 cells. Notably, when cells werecotransfected with miR‑762 and miR‑642a‑3p inhibitors, SAHA‑induceddownregulation of Her2/neu was inhibited, and SAHA‑induced apoptosis and poly(ADP‑ribose) polymerase cleavage were significantly reduced in BT474 cells. Theseresults indicated that numerous HDACi‑induced miRNAs are required to downregulateHer2/neu levels and promote apoptosis of Her2‑overexpressing breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3616 PMID: 29620153
