We here retrospectively showed that regularuse of antilipidemic drug statins could provide a longer progression freesurvival (PFS) in RCC patients prescribed with an mTOR inhibitor everolimus than without statins (median PFS, 7.5 months vs. 3.2 months, respectively; hazardratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.22-1.11). In order to give a rationale for this finding,we used RCC cell lines and showed the combinatorial effects of an mTOR inhibitor with statins induced a robust activation of retinoblastoma protein, whosemechanisms were involved in statins-mediated hindrance of KRAS or Rac1 proteinprenylation. Finally, statins treatment also enhanced the efficacy of an mTORinhibitor in RCC xenograft models. Thus, we provide molecular and (pre)clinicaldata showing that statins use could be a drug repositioning for RCC patients toenhance the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
