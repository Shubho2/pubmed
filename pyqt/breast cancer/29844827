China.Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-associated mortality and themost frequently diagnosed type of cancer in women worldwide. It has been revealedthat the chemokine C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) serves a pivotal rolein breast cancer growth and is associated with lymph node metastasis. However, tothe best of our knowledge, the mechanism by which CXCL13 mediates breast cancergrowth remains uncharacterized. Female BALB/c mice were used in this study. Tumorvolume was calculated and changes of gross tumor morphology were observed byhematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression of CXCL13, C-X-C motif chemokinereceptor 5 (CXCR5) and extracellular signaling-related kinase (ERK) mRNA andprotein expression were detected by reverse transcriptase quantitative-polymerasechain reaction and western blot analysis. Simultaneously, the production ofcytokines [interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and tumor growthfactor β1 (TGF-β1)] was detected by an ELISA. The CXCL13 inhibitor reduced tumor volume and growth, and reduced the mRNA and protein expression levels of keymembers of the CXCR5/ERK signaling pathway: CXCL13, CXCR5 and ERK. Furthermore,the detectable concentration of the cytokines IL-1β and TNF decreased followingCXCL13 inhibition, whereas the concentration of TGF-β1 was increased. Theattenuation of tumor growth resulting from CXCL13 inhibition may be associatedwith the CXCR5/ERK signaling pathway. This study provides a theoretical basis fortreating breast cancer through CXCL13 inhibition in clinical trials.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8510 PMCID: PMC5958818PMID: 29844827
