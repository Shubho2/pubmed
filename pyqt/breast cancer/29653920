This process ishighly variable from family to family. Interventions that support communicationof genetic test results, coping, and offer decision support in families harboringa pathogenic variant may contribute to effective management of hereditary cancer.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the development of the FamilyGene Toolkit, a Web-based intervention targeting BRCA carriers and untested bloodrelatives, designed to enhance coping, family communication, and decision making.METHODS: We present findings from focus groups regarding interventionacceptability and participant satisfaction and from a pre-post pilot study withrandom allocation to a wait-listed control group regarding interventionfeasibility and usability.RESULTS: The Family Gene Toolkit was developed by a multidisciplinary team as apsycho-educational and skills-building intervention. It includes two live webinarsessions and a follow-up phone call guided by a certified genetic counselor and amaster's prepared oncology nurse. Each live webinar includes two modules (totalfour modules) presenting information about BRCA mutations, a decision aid forgenetic testing, and two skill-building modules for effective coping and familycommunication. Participants in focus groups (n=11) were highly satisfied with theintervention, reporting it to be useful and describing clearly the importantissues. From the 12 dyads recruited in the pre-post pilot study (response rate12/52, 23%), completion rate was 71% (10/14) for intervention and 40% (4/10) for wait-listed control groups.CONCLUSIONS: Acceptability and satisfaction with the Family Gene Toolkit is high.On the basis of the findings from usability and feasibility testing,modifications on timing, delivery mode, and recruitment methods have beenimplemented.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02154633;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02154633 (Archived by WebCite athttp://www.webcitation.org/6yYNvLPjv).Â©Maria C Katapodi, Miyeon Jung, Ann M Schafenacker, Kara J Milliron, Kari EMendelsohn-Victor, Sofia D Merajver, Laurel L Northouse.
