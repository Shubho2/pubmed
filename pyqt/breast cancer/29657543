The research papers were selected by using the primary key-termsincluding "ABO blood type", "Rhesus" blood type and "breast cancer". The researchdocuments in which "ABO" and "Rhesus" blood types and breast cancer was debatedwere included. After screening, we reviewed 32 papers and finally we selected 25 research papers which met the inclusion criteria and remaining documents wereexcluded.Results: Blood group "A" has high incidence of breast cancer (45.88%), bloodgroup "O" has (31.69%); "B" (16.16%) and blood group "AB" has (6.27%) incidenceof breast cancer. Blood group "A" has highest and blood group "AB" has leastassociation with breast cancer. Furthermore, "Rhesus +ve" blood group has highincidence of breast cancer (88.31%) and "Rhesus -ve" blood group has leastassociation with breast cancer (11.68%).Conclusion: Blood group "A" and "Rhesus +ve" have high risk of breast cancer,while blood type "AB" and "Rhesus -ve" are at low peril of breast cancer.Physicians should carefully monitor the females with blood group "A" and "Rh +ve"as these females are more prone to develop breast cancer. To reduce breast cancerincidence and its burden, preventive and screening programs for breast cancerespecially in young women are highly recommended.DOI: 10.1016/j.sjbs.2017.01.058 PMCID: PMC5892599PMID: 29657543
