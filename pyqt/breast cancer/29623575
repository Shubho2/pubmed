Atotal of 175 patients (40.1%) received eribulin for fewer than 90 days and theothers received it for 90 days or more. Eight patients (1.83%) had completeremission, 82 (18.8%) had partial remission, 202 (46.3%) had stable disease, and 144 (33.0%) had progressive disease (PD). Patients' tumors with the luminal Asubtype had a significantly better objective response rate. Kaplan-Meier analysisindicated that hormone receptor positivity, luminal A subtype, receipt oferibulin as the 1st to 3rd line therapy, and metastasis to fewer than 4 organswere significantly associated with longer TTF. Stepwise multivariate analysisshowed that only receipt of eribulin as the 1st to 3rd line therapy wassignificantly associated with TTF (HR 1.49, p < 0.001). All toxicities weremanageable and only 18 patients (4.1%) discontinued treatment due to adverseevents.CONCLUSIONS: Eribulin appears to have better efficacy and cause fewer adverseevents, especially neutropenia, in Taiwanese women than Western women.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4778-y PMCID: PMC6022524PMID: 29623575
