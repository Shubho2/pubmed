The present study envisaged to develop doxorubicin (Dox) loaded folate functionalized nanoemulsion (NE) for profoundtherapeutic activity against mammary gland cancer. NE was prepared usingpseudo-ternary phase diagrams utilizing α-linolenic acid (ALA) as lipid phase, tofurther enhance the anticancer potential of Dox. Box-Behnken design was employed to systematically develop the NE. Optimized NE (f-Dox-NE) was evaluated for invitro and in vivo performance. f-Dox-NE, with globule size 55.2 ± 3.3 nm, zetapotential - 31 ± 2 mV, entrapment 92.51 ± 3.62%, drug loading 0.42 ± 0.08% andpercent drug release 94.86 ± 1.87% in 72 h, was capable of reducing cellviability in MCF-7 cell lines vis-à-vis pure and marketed drug. Further,mechanistic studies in MCF-7 cell lines demonstrated that f-Dox-NE inducescellular apoptosis by reactive oxygen species generated and mitochondrialmembrane mediated apoptosis. The antitumor effect was evaluated in7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) induced mammary gland tumor in femaleAlbino Wistar rats. f-Dox-NE exhibited enhanced antitumor targeting potential,therapeutic safety and efficacy vis-à-vis pure and marketed drug, as revealed by tumor volume, animal survival, weight variation, cardiotoxicity andbiodistribution studies. f-Dox-NE restored the biochemical parameters viz., SOD, catalase, TBARS and protein carbonyl, towards normal levels in comparison to DMBAinduced animal group. f-Dox-NE displayed downregulation of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and MMP-9) proteins and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (caspase-9 andBAX). The experimental results suggest that ALA augmented folate functionalizedNE are able to overcome the challenges of developing safe and effective delivery system with enhanced potential for mammary gland carcinoma therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s13346-018-0525-5 PMID: 29748834
