Management of radial scar (RS) found on breast core needlebiopsies (CNB) ranges from excision to clinical observation due to the variation in reported upgrades to malignancy at surgical excision. We examined the upgrade rate in patients with RS detected on CNB at our institution and reviewed thecurrent literature.METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of all cases with RS diagnosed onCNB between December 2006 and March 2017 at our institution. Inclusion criteriawere patients with "pure" RS and RS associated with high-risk lesions (HRL).Upgrade was defined as invasive or non-invasive cancer in the excisional biopsy.RESULTS: 157 cases were identified with RS on CNB, and 122 cases met inclusioncriteria. Of these 122 cases, 91 (75%) had pure RS on CNB while 31 (25%) hadassociated atypia or HRL. 81 (66%) of patients proceeded to excisional biopsy and41 (34%) did not. Two patients (1.6% of total) were found to have a low-gradeinvasive ductal carcinoma (0.6 and 0.8Â cm) upon surgical excision. None of theremaining 120 patients developed an ipsilateral breast cancer with a mean of32.3-month follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: We found a very low upgrade rate to breast cancer when RS was found on CNB with or without associated HRL. Our results are consistent with otherreported series. Our data do not support surgical excision for RS but ratherclose clinical follow-up for patients with RS on CNB.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4741-y PMCID: PMC5999183PMID: 29532340
