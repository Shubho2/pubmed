With theobjective of increasing the selectivity for COX-2, we introduced a chlorinesubstituent in position 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the ASS moiety, respectively. Increased COX-2 selectivity is desirable as this isoenzyme is predominantly related to the development of cancer and abnormal tissue growth. The new compounds wereinvestigated in comprehensive cellular biological assays to identify the impactof the chlorine substitution at the complex on COX-1/2 inhibition,antiproliferative activity, apoptosis, metabolic activity, cell-based COXinhibition, and cellular uptake. Chlorination distinctly reduced the effects atisolated COX-1 (about 25% inhibition at 10 μM; Co-ASS: 82.7%), while those atCOX-2 remained almost unchanged (about 65% inhibition at 10 μM; Co-ASS: 78.5%).In cellular systems, with exception of the 6-Cl derivative, all compounds showed notable antitumor activity in COX-1/2 expressing tumor cells (HT-29 (IC50 =1.5-2.7 μM), MDA-MB-231 (IC50 = 5.2-8.0 μM)), but were distinctly less active in the COX-1/2-negative MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (IC50 = 15.2-22.9 μM). Allcomplexes possess high selectivity for tumor cells, because they did notinfluence the growth of the non-tumorigenic, human bone marrow stromal cell line HS-5. These findings clearly demonstrate that the interference with the COX-1/2cascade contributes to the mode of anticancer action of the cobalt alkynecomplexes.DOI: 10.1039/c7dt04790h PMID: 29492489
