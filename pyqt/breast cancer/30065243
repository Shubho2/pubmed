While consequences ofextracellular acidosis are known, the roles of intracellular alkalization areincompletely understood. By reconstructing and integrating enzymatic pH-dependentactivity profiles into cell-specific genome-scale metabolic models, we develop a computational methodology that explores how intracellular pH (pHi) can modulatemetabolism. We show that in silico, alkaline pHi maximizes cancer cellproliferation coupled to increased glycolysis and adaptation to hypoxia (i.e.,the Warburg effect), whereas acidic pHi disables these adaptations andcompromises tumor cell growth. We then systematically identify metabolic targets (GAPDH and GPI) with predicted amplified anti-cancer effects at acidic pHi,forming a novel therapeutic strategy. Experimental testing of this strategy inbreast cancer cells reveals that it is particularly effective against aggressive phenotypes. Hence, this study suggests essential roles of pHi in cancermetabolism and provides a conceptual and computational framework for exploringpHi roles in other biomedical domains.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05261-x PMCID: PMC6068141PMID: 30065243
