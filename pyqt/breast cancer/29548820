Nonetheless, only 33% oftreated cases exhibit long term responses. Circulating tumor cell (CTC)measurements are currently of clinical value in breast, prostate and colorectalcancers. However, the clinical utility of melanoma CTCs (MelCTCs) is stillunclear due to challenges that appear intrinsic to MelCTCs (i.e. rarity,heterogeneity) and a lack of standardization in their isolation, across research laboratories. Here, we review the latest developments, pinpoint the challenges inMelCTC isolation and address their potential role in melanoma management.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
