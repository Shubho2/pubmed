Its targeting capabilities were evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry (FCM) in vitro. Contrast-enhancedultrasound imaging (CEUS) with DNCs was evaluated qualitatively andquantitatively in vitro and in MCF-7 orthotopic mice model by two differentsystems. The biodistribution of NCs in mice was preliminary investigated.Differences were calculated by using analysis of variance.Results: DNCs showed a well-defined spherical morphology with an average diameterof 276.90±110.50 nm. In vitro, DNCs exhibited high target specificities(79.01±5.63% vs. 2.11±1.07%, P<0.01; 75.54±6.58% vs. 5.21±3.12%, P<0.01) inVEGFR2- and p53-positive cells compared with control cells. In vivo, CEUSdisplayed a significantly higher video intensity in two systems using DNCs incomparison with non-targeted PLGA@Au NCs and single-targeted NCs. Biodistributionstudies revealed that more DNCs in breast cancer tissue could be detected in micethan in other NCs (P<0.05).Conclusion: DNCs were demonstrated to be novel dual-targeted UCAs and may havepotential applications in early non-invasive visualization of breast cancer.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S153993 PMCID: PMC5868579PMID: 29606871  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
