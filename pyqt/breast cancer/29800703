Electronic address: Shamgar@post.tau.ac.il.Catecholamines and prostaglandins are secreted abundantly during theperioperative period in response to stress and surgery, and were shown bytranslational studies to promote tumor metastasis. Here, in a phase-II biomarker clinical trial in breast cancer patients (n = 38), we tested the combinedperioperative use of the β-blocker, propranolol, and the COX2-inhibitor,etodolac, scheduled for 11 consecutive perioperative days, starting 5 days beforesurgery. Blood samples were taken before treatment (T1), on the mornings beforeand after surgery (T2&T3), and after treatment cessation (T4). Drugs were welltolerated. Results based on a-priori hypotheses indicated that already beforesurgery (T2), serum levels of pro-inflammatory IL-6, CRP, and IFNγ, andanti-inflammatory, cortisol and IL-10, increased. At T2 and/or T3, drug treatmentreduced serum levels of the above pro-inflammatory cytokines and of TRAIL, aswell as activity of multiple inflammation-related transcription factors(including NFκB, STAT3, ISRE), but not serum levels of cortisol, IL-10, IL-18,IL-8, VEGF and TNFα. In the excised tumor, treatment reduced the expression ofthe proliferation marker Ki-67, and positively affected its transcription factorsSP1 and AhR. Exploratory analyses of transcriptome modulation in PBMCs revealedtreatment-induced improvement at T2/T3 in several transcription factors that inprimary tumors indicate poor prognosis (CUX1, THRa, EVI1, RORa, PBX1, and T3R),angiogenesis (YY1), EMT (GATA1 and deltaEF1/ZEB1), proliferation (GATA2), andglucocorticoids response (GRE), while increasing the activity of the oncogenesc-MYB and N-MYC. Overall, the drug treatment may benefit breast cancer patientsthrough reducing systemic inflammation and pro-metastatic/pro-growth biomarkersin the excised tumor and PBMCs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
