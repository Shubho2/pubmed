Electronic address: mohamed.gad@guc.edu.eg.Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) gas has been recognized as an intracellular mediatorinfluencing an array of signaling pathways. Yet, the role of H2S in cancerprogression has been controversial. This study aims to unravel the role ofexogenous H2S in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and to further investigate any possible association of H2S mediated actions with the endogenous productionof nitric oxide (NO) gas. A wide concentration range of NaHS (20-2000 μM) and avariable reaction time (2-72 h) were probed. A bell-shaped impact of H2S on TNBC cellular viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and colony forming abilitywas repeatedly observed in the aggressive TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 but not in hormone receptor positive, MCF-7 cells. This bell-shaped effect was found to beshifted towards the left upon increasing the reaction time within the range of2-24 h. However, this was totally opposed in case of continuous exposure (72 h)to exogenous H2S. An inverted bell-shaped effect of H2S on TNBC cellular growth, migration, proliferation and colony forming ability was shown. Moreover, thisstudy provided the first evidence of a possible involvement of NO in mediatingH2S actions in TNBC. Such intricate cross-talk was found to be orchestrated bythe novel lncRNA, sONE and its down-stream target NOS3 building up a novel axis, sONE/NOS3/NO, that was shown to play a pivotal role in plotting the bilateraleffect of H2S on TNBC progression. Finally, this study showed that low andcontinuous exposure of H2S serves as a novel, selective and effective strategy inharnessing TNBC oncogenic profile through cGMP dependent and independent pathwayswhere alterations of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as TP53 and c-Myc wasobserved. Moreover, NaHS could repress TNBC migration and invasion capacitiesthrough repressing the intracellular adhesion molecule, ICAM-1. In conclusion,this study provides an insight about the role of exogenous H2S in TNBC cell lineshighlighting a novel crosstalk between H2S and NO orchestrated by sONE/NOS3 axis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
