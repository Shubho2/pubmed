In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of breast reconstruction onpostoperative shoulder function and muscle performance by evaluating isokineticmuscle performance tests.A retrospective chart review to collect data on shoulderfunction analysis with isokinetic muscle performance testing was performed among patients who received mastectomy with IBR from July 2013 to March 2015. Patients were categorized into 4 groups: a control group that underwent mastectomy withoutreconstruction, a tissue expander/implant insertion group, a pedicled latissimus dorsi (LD) flap group, and a free transverse rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM) flap group.Analysis of the groups at 1 to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, 10 to 12, and 13 to 15months postoperatively showed significant shoulder function improvement in thetissue expander/implant and TRAM groups as measured by linear regressionanalysis. Compared with the control group, patients who received immediatereconstruction with tissue expander/implant insertion or a TRAM flap showedstatistically significant improvement in shoulder function after mastectomy.IBRwith a TRAM flap or tissue expander/implant insertion were more beneficial forshoulder rehabilitation and for regaining function compared to mastectomy aloneand breast reconstruction with a LD flap.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010979 PMCID: PMC6023658PMID: 29901587  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
