Patients andMethods: A total of 142,433 patients aged ≥66 years diagnosed with stage I-IIIbreast cancer between 2007 and 2011 were identified in the SEER-Medicare linkeddatabase. Algorithms considering cancer characteristics and the appropriatecourse of care as per guidelines versus actual care received determined receiptof GCC. Multivariable logistic regression estimated the likelihood of GCC andspecific types of treatment for women aged ≥75 versus 66 to 74 years. Results:Overall, 39.7% of patients received GCC. Patients diagnosed at stage II or III,with certain preexisting conditions, and of nonwhite race were less likely toreceive GCC. Patients with hormone-negative tumors, higher grade tumors, andgreater access to oncology care resources were more likely to receive GCC.Patients aged ≥75 years were approximately 40% less likely to receive GCC oradjuvant endocrine therapy, 78% less likely to have any surgery, 61% less likely to have chemotherapy, and about half as likely to have radiation therapy thanthose aged 66 to 74 years. Conclusions: Fewer than half of older women withbreast cancer received GCC, with the lowest rates observed among the oldest agegroups, racial/ethnic minorities, and women with later-stage cancers. However,patients with more aggressive tumor characteristics and greater access tooncology resources were more likely to receive GCC. Considering that older women have the highest incidence of breast cancer and that many are diagnosed at stagesrequiring more aggressive treatment, efforts to increase rates of earlier stagediagnosis and the development of less toxic treatments could help improve GCC andsurvival while preserving quality of life.Copyright © 2018 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.DOI: 10.6004/jnccn.2018.7004 PMID: 29891521
