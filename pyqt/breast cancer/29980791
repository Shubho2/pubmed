However,the molecular mechanisms underlying ARID1A deficiency in cancer biology remain tobe investigated. Using breast cancer as a model, we report that silencing ARID1A significantly increased cellular proliferation and migration. Mechanistically,primarily functioning as a transcriptional repressor, loss of ARID1A profoundlyalters histone modifications and the transcriptome. Notably, ARID1A inhibited theexpression of a long non-coding RNA, UCA1, by regulating chromatin access of the transcription factor CEBPα. Restoration experiments showed that UCA1 mediates thefunctions of ARID1A that induces loss of cellular proliferation and migration.Together, our findings characterize ARID1A as a key tumor-suppressor gene inbreast cancer through cooperation with CEBPα, and loss-of-function mutations ofARID1A activates UCA1.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0371-4 PMID: 29980791
