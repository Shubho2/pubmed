China.Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is an important regulator intumorigenesis of human breast cancer, and if silenced leads to programmed celldeath in specific breast cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 cells. In thepresent study, RNA interference, proliferation assay and semi-quantification ofcell cycle relative proteins were performed to determine the effects of MELK inhuman breast cancer cells. Data demonstrated that the highest level of MELKprotein in the MDA-MB-231 cell line among eight breast cancer cell lines. Thesensitivity of MELK small interfering-RNA varied in different breast cancer cell lines, but MELK silencing resulted in marked suppression of proliferation oftriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-TNBC cells. Specific silencing ofMELK caused G2 arrest in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and HCC1143 cells, and G1 arrest innon-TNBC T47D and MCF7 cells. Notably, the knockdown of MELK did not induceapoptosis in HCC1143 cells, indicated by the lack of caspase-3 expression. Inaddition, in response to MELK silencing, cyclin B and cyclin D1 weredownregulated in four breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the silencing ofMELK resulted in the upregulation of p21, p27 and phosphorylated (p)-c-JunN-terminal kinase (JNK) in HCC1143 TNBC cells, and downregulation of p21 andp-JNK in T47D non-TNBC cells. Additionally, MELK protein was markedly suppressed in non-TNBC cells in response to estrogen deprivation. The findings from thepresent study suggested that MELK may be a potential target in MDA-MB-231 cells, although genetic knockdown of MELK resulted in inhibitory effects onproliferation of TNBC and non-TNBC cells. MELK exert its effect on differentbreast cancer cells via arrest of different cell cycle phases and thereforemediated by different mediators, which may be involved in the crosstalk with MELKsignaling and with the estrogen receptor signaling pathway.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8543 PMCID: PMC5958721PMID: 29805690
