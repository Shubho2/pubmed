Electronic address: gvalacc@ncsu.edu.In the past few years, we focused the interest on rottlerin, an old/new naturalsubstance that, over the time, has revealed a number of cellular and moleculartargets, all potentially implicated in the fight against cancer. Past and recent literature well demonstrated that rottlerin is an inhibitor of enzymes,transcription factors and signaling molecules that control cancer cell life anddeath. Although the rottlerin anticancer activity has been mainly ascribed toapoptosis and/or autophagy induction, recent findings unveiled the existence ofadditional mechanisms of toxicity. The major novelties highlighted in this minireview are the ability to bind and inhibit key molecules, such as ERK and mTOR,directly, thus independently of upstream signaling cascades, and to cause aprofound dysregulation of cap-dependent protein translation through themTORC1/4EBP1/eIF4E axis and by inhibition of eIF2, an initiation factor oftranslation that is negatively regulated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.These last mechanisms, proved to be lethal in cancer cell lines derived frombreast and skin, strongly enforce the potential of rottlerin as a promisingnatural lead compound for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.abb.2018.03.009 PMID: 29545132
