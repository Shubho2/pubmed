[Epub ahead of print]Silencing ARHGAP9 correlates with the risk of breast cancer and inhibits theproliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer.Wang T(1), Ha M(1).Author information: (1)Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou MedicalUniversity, Jinzhou, China.Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in women, andscreening relevant genes and markers that are involved in BC tumor genesis andprogression is of great value. We previously found that messenger RNA expression of ARHGAP9 was high in BC tissue, but it is unclear whether ARHGAP9 participates in the progression of human BC. In this study, we found that ARHGAP9 expressionwas correlated with poor patient survival, American Joint Committee on Cancerclinical staging, tumor size, and tumor differentiation. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells exhibited higher expression of ARHGAP9 than other human BC cell lines(HCC1937, MDA-MB-453, ZR-75-1, and Hs 578T). Knockdown of ARHGAP9 in human BCcells markedly reduced the cell proliferation, migration, and invasive ability ofMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, small interfering RNA (siRNA) of ARHGAP9also induced G0-G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.Expressions of cell cycle markers (CDK2 and CCNB1) and invasion-related protein(RhoC and MTA1) were downregulated in siRNA-ARHGAP9-transfected cells. siRNA ofARHGAP9 also inhibited the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinasesin BC cells. In conclusion, the abnormal expression of ARHGAP9 may correlate withthe genesis, development, and diagnosis of BC.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcb.27127 PMID: 29905031
