Electronicaddress: davidst@exchange.bgu.ac.il.The effect of topical co-administration of promoter drugs with paclitaxel toincrease anti-tumor effects of paclitaxel was investigated. Mice with orthotopic 4T1-Luc breast cancer received single intra-tumoral injection of a polymericformulation with paclitaxel and a specific promoter drug. Several promoter drugs were evaluated, including: dexamethasone, losartan, nicotinamide, Azone, andoleic acid. Dexamethasone exhibited the highest effect on paclitaxel anti-tumoractivity, in a dose-dependent fashion. However, this effect was accompanied bysystemic effects of dexamethasone, and inability to prevent tumor metastasis tothe lungs. Topical co-administration of promoter drugs with anti-cancer agentscan enhance their anti-tumor effects. Further investigations are needed toidentify the most efficient combinations of promoter and anti-cancer drugs, andtheir suitability for the clinical management of the breast cancer disease.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
