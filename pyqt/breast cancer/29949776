Electronicaddress: t.k.vandenberg@sanquin.nl.Destruction of cancer cells by therapeutic antibodies occurs, at least in part,through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and this can be mediatedby various Fc-receptor-expressing immune cells, including neutrophils. However,the mechanism(s) by which neutrophils kill antibody-opsonized cancer cells hasnot been established. Here, we demonstrate that neutrophils can exert a mode ofdestruction of cancer cells, which involves antibody-mediated trogocytosis byneutrophils. Intimately associated with this is an active mechanical disruptionof the cancer cell plasma membrane, leading to a lytic (i.e., necrotic) type ofcancer cell death. Furthermore, this mode of destruction of antibody-opsonizedcancer cells by neutrophils is potentiated by CD47-SIRPα checkpoint blockade.Collectively, these findings show that neutrophil ADCC toward cancer cells occursby a mechanism of cytotoxicity called trogoptosis, which can be further improved by targeting CD47-SIRPα interactions.Crown Copyright © 2018.
