NVP-BKM120, a selective pan-PI3K inhibitor, exerts theantitumor activity by suppressing the PI3K signaling pathway. Prima-1Met, a lowmolecular weight compound, can rescue the gain-of-function of mutant p53 byrestoring its transcriptional function. In this study, we investigated whetherPI3K inhibition combined with mutant p53 reactivation could enhance the antitumoreffect in thyroid cancer cells.METHODS: The effects of BKM120 and Prima-1Met on the proliferation, apoptosis,migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells were measured by MTT, colonyformation, flow cytometry, wound-healing and transwell assays, respectively.Thyroid differentiation was assessed by detecting the expression levels ofspecific markers using RT-PCR and Western blot. The in vivo antitumor efficacywas analyzed in a mouse xenograft model.RESULTS: The combinational treatment of BKM120 and Prima-1Met significantlyenhanced the inhibitions of cell viability, colony formation, migration andinvasion, and the induction of apoptosis in thyroid cell lines, andsynergistically suppressed tumor xenograft growth by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTORand EMT signaling pathways, up-regulating p53 targeted genes, and triggering the release of cytochrome c. Moreover, the combination of BKM120 and Prima-1Metsuppressed the stemlike traits of thyroid cancer cells and promoted theirdifferentiation by upregulating the expression of thyroid-specificdifferentiation markers and repressing the expression of cancer stem cellmarkers. Furthermore, the mechanism study demonstrated that the combinationaltreatment synergistically abrogated the binding of CPSF4 at the promoter of hTERTand thus suppressed hTERT expression. Consistently, overexpression of hTERTrescued the inhibitions of cell viability, invasion and stem-like traits mediatedby the combination of BKM120 and Prima-1Met.CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the combination of BKM120 with Prima-1Metsynergistically suppressed the growth of thyroid cancer cells and tumorxenografts via inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR and CPSF4/hTERT signaling andreactivating mutant p53.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
