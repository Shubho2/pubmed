This practicestrains an already overburdened emergency department and is associated with long wait times and poor disease/injection education for patients. This pilot studysought to determine if stable cancer patients with newly diagnosedcancer-associated thrombosis could be effectively managed by community-basedpharmacists who followed an evidence-based protocol to prescribe and initiatelow-molecular weight heparin therapy. We hypothesized that this novel carepathway could provide faster patient care with more comprehensive diseaseeducation, self-injection training, and follow-up. Fifty-five patients withvarious cancers, including gastroesophageal, urogenital, breast, brain, and lung were enrolled into this pilot study. We observed that this alternative first-dosetreatment pathway provided safe and effective treatment of venous thromboembolismcombined with excellent patient satisfaction. Following their interaction withthe pharmacist, patients felt confident about their ability to self-inject andabout their venous thromboembolism management overall. No occurrences of bleedingor other side-effects were observed. This pilot study demonstrates thatcommunity-based pharmacists are capable of delivering complex care services inthe outpatient environment, particularly in the management of venousthromboembolism.DOI: 10.1177/1078155218760704 PMID: 29540105
