Mammographic and sonographicfindings were evaluated using the BI-RADS lexicon by a radiologist blinded topathology, and the findings in the two groups were compared. The degree ofdiscrepancy between imaging and pathological sizing in the two groups wasevaluated.RESULTS: Lesions were mammographically occult in 11% of pILC and 14% of cILC(p = 0.56). On mammography, skin or trabecular thickening and microcalcification were commoner in pILC than cILC (13% vs. 1%, p < 0.01; 25% vs. 5%, p < 0.01).Architectural distortion was more frequent in cILC than pILC (26% vs. 9%,p = 0.01). On ultrasound, pILC more frequently exhibited mixed echogenicity (28% vs. 13%; p = 0.04), skin thickening, subcutaneous or parenchymal edema (8% vs.0%; p = 0.02), echogenic surrounding fat (33% vs. 9%; p < 0.01), and posterioracoustic enhancement (10% vs. 1%; p = 0.02) than cILC. CILC was more frequentlymanifested as a focal area of altered echogenicity (24% vs. 8%; p = 0.04). Meanelastography stiffness was higher for pILC (174.8 vs. 124.6 kPa; p = 0.02).Imaging-pathological size disparity was similar for both subtypes.CONCLUSION: There are differences in the imaging features between pILC and cILCwhich reflect the more aggressive nature of pILC.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4914-8 PMID: 30094553
