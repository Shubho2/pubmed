VEGFR signaling isassociated with the progression of pathological angiogenesis in various types of malignancies, making it an attractive therapeutic target in cancer treatment. In the present work, we report the synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazolesand 1,2,4-triazolo[1, 5-a]pyrimidine derivatives via copper (I)-catalyzedazide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction and screened for their anticanceractivity against MCF7 cells. We identified1-(2'-ethoxy-4'-fluoro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-4-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole (EFT) as lead cytotoxic agent against MCF7 cell lines with an IC50 value of 1.69 µM.Further evaluation revealed that EFT induces cytotoxicity on Ishikawa, MDA-MB-231and BT474 cells with IC50 values of 1.97, 4.81 and 4.08 µM respectively. However,EFT did not induce cytotoxicity in normal lung epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells.Previous reports suggested that 1,2,3-triazoles are the inhibitors of VEGFR1 and therefore, we evaluated the effect of EFT on the expression of VEGFR1. Theresults demonstrated that EFT downregulates the expression of VEGFR1 in MCF7cells. In summary, we identified a potent cytotoxic agent that imparts itsantiproliferative activity by targeting VEGFR1 in breast cancer cells. The novel compound could serve as a lead structure in developing VEGFR1 inhibitors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2018.05.020 PMID: 29789259
