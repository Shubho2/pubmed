This stage between localized and systemic disease is key tounderstanding breast cancer progression; however, our knowledge of the evolution of lymph node malignant invasion remains limited, as most currently availabledata are derived from primary tumors.Experimental Design: In 11 patients withtreatment-naïve node-positive early breast cancer without clinical evidence ofdistant metastasis, we investigated lymph node evolution using spatialmultiregion sequencing (n = 78 samples) of primary and lymph node deposits andgenomic profiling of matched longitudinal circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).Results: Linear evolution from primary to lymph node was rare (1/11), whereas the majorityof cases displayed either early divergence between primary and nodes (4/11) or nodetectable divergence (6/11), where both primary and nodal cells belonged to asingle recent expansion of a metastatic clone. Divergence of metastatic subcloneswas driven in part by APOBEC. Longitudinal ctDNA samples from 2 of 7 subjectswith evaluable plasma taken perioperatively reflected the two major evolutionary patterns and demonstrate that private mutations can be detected even from earlymetastatic nodal deposits. Moreover, node removal resulted in disappearance ofprivate lymph node mutations in ctDNA.Conclusions: This study sheds new light on a crucial evolutionary step in the natural history of breast cancer,demonstrating early establishment of axillary lymph node metastasis in asubstantial proportion of patients.
