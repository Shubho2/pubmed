Electronic address: mdashkezary@yahoo.com.Systemic chemotherapy as a routine method for the treatment of cancers hasseveral complications. Localized chemotherapy can significantly increase thetreatment efficacy and reduce side effects. Here, mesenchymal stem cells derived microvesicles (MVs) was incorporated into Polycaprolactone nanofibers and thenthe apoptotic behavior of MCF-7 breast cancer cells was investigated whilecultured on MVs-Polycaprolactone by using SEM, MTT and apoptotic gene expression.Results demonstrated that MVs-Polycaprolactone group was shown a great apoptosis induction potential into MCF-7 cells and it can be concluded thatMVs-Polycaprolactone has a great promising potential to introduce as an in-situtumor inhibitor construct rather than chemo-drugs.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
