As array-based technology has been largelyreplaced by next generation sequencing approaches, it has become important todevelop algorithms that derive the same type of genomic scar scores from nextgeneration sequencing (whole exome "WXS", whole genome "WGS") data. In order toperform this analysis, we introduce here the scarHRD R package and show thatusing this method the SNP array-based and next generation sequencing-basedderivation of HRD scores show good correlation (Pearson correlation between 0.73 and 0.87 depending on the actual HRD measure) and that the NGS-based HRD scoresdistinguish similarly well between BRCA mutant and BRCA wild-type cases in acohort of triple-negative breast cancer patients of the TCGA data set.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0066-6 PMCID: PMC6028448PMID: 29978035
