Further, gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genesand Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were then performed. The genes in significant enriched pathways were finally quantified by quantitative real-timePCR (qRT-PCR) to confirm that they were differentially expressed. Additionally,GSE23988 from Gene Expression Omnibus database was used as the validation datasetto confirm the DEGs.RESULTS: After removing the low-quality reads, 715 DEGs were finally detected.After mapping to KEGG pathways, 10 DEGs belonging to the ubiquitin proteasomepathway (HECTD3, PSMB10, UBD, UBE2C, and UBE2S) and cytokine-cytokine receptorinteractions (CCL2, CCR1, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IL2RG) were selected for furtheranalysis. These 10 genes were finally quantified by qRT-PCR to confirm that they were differentially expressed (the log2 fold changes of selected genes were-â€‰5.34, 7.81, 6.88, 5.74, 3.11, 19.58, 8.73, 8.88, 7.42, and 34.61 for HECTD3,PSMB10, UBD, UBE2C, UBE2S, CCL2, CCR1, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IL2RG, respectively). Moreover, 53 common genes were confirmed by the validation dataset, includingdownregulated UBE2C and UBE2S.CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that these 10 genes belonging to these twopathways might be useful as sensitive biomarkers for the efficacy evaluation ofneoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1380-z PMCID: PMC5914024PMID: 29685151
