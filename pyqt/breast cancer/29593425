A previous study identified somepatients with GATA3 gene variants and breast cancer, suggesting that GATA3variants may contribute to tumorigenesis in estrogen receptor 1-positive breasttumors; however, these patients did not have HDR syndrome. A 32-year-oldnonsmoking Japanese woman was histologically diagnosed with lung squamous cellcarcinoma associated with HDR syndrome and a c.C952T>C (p.C318R) germlinemutation in GATA3. This is the first report describing cancer in a patient withHDR syndrome. Our data indicates that GATA3 mutations may be a potentialtherapeutic target for lung cancer.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S161420 PMCID: PMC5865551PMID: 29593425
