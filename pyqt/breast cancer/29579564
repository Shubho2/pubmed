The PIC micelles can be readily prepared by mixing a polycationic block polymer,methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(l-lysine) (mPEG-PLL), with a small molecule polyacid, 2, 2'-dithiodisuccinic acid (DTS) in aqueous media. The resultant PICmicelles are of uniform spherical shapes with hydrodynamic radii ranging from 65 to 75 nm based on different feeding ratios of mPEG-PLL and DTS. Interestingly, byusing the small molecule polyacid DTS, the obtained PIC micelles show distinctpH-responsive disintegration in acid solution. Meanwhile, the PIC micelles werealso assessed to be reduction-responsive due to the presence of disulfide bond inDTS. In view of these stimuli-responsive properties, the potential use of thisPIC micelle as smart drug carrier was then investigated. Doxorubicin (DOX), acationic anticancer drug, was loaded into the PIC micelles with high efficiency. In vitro drug release studies revealed that release of DOX from the PIC micelles was suppressed in neutral solutions due to the stable electrostatic interactions between PIC micelles and DOX, but could be accelerated in acidic solutions orunder high GSH condition. Furthermore, flow cytometry and confocal laser scanningmicroscopy (CLSM) studies indicated that the DOX-loaded PIC micelles could beeffectively internalized by MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and release theloaded DOX in intracellular environment. Consequently, the DOX-loaded PICmicelles were capable of inhibiting the proliferation of C26 murine colon cancer and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in high efficiency, showing similar IC50values as free DOX. Thus, this biocompatible PIC micelle may be promising forintracellular drug delivery.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.jcis.2018.03.049 PMID: 29579564
