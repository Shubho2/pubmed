The diagnostic performance of MRI to exclude malignancy wascalculated.RESULTS: The average reader sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and accuracy of MRI were 92%, 51%, 98%, 22% and 56%,respectively.CONCLUSION: Lack of enhancement on MRI at the site of a high-risk lesion wasuseful for excluding malignancy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
