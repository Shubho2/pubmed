The underlyingmechanism has been investigated by examining the impact of nutritional parameterson T cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells, but little is known about their effect on checkpoint molecules.Methods: Here, we investigated the correlation of mRNA expression of programmedcell death protein 1 (PD-1), cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28), cytotoxicT-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25) withAGR, ALB, GLB, total protein, pre-ALB, Hb, BMI, and PNI in the peripheral bloodof breast cancer patients. One hundred and three patients and 21 age- andsex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Quantitative real-time PCR was usedto test relative mRNA expression.Results: The results indicated that the mRNA levels of PD-1 and CD25 were 5.2-and 3.3-fold higher in patients with low AGR than in those with high AGR (P <0.05). The mRNA levels of PD-1 were 3.5-fold higher in patients with high GLBthan in those with low GLB (P < 0.05). In addition, breast cancer patients hadhigher expression levels of PD-1, CD28, CTLA-4, and CD25 mRNA in their peripheralblood compared with healthy volunteers (P < 0.05).Conclusion: These results suggest that AGR is negatively correlated with PD-1 andCD25 mRNA levels, while GLB is positively associated with PD-1 mRNA levels.Nutritional status in breast cancer patients may influence the PD-1 pathway andhave implications for the optimization of cancer therapy.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S159481 PMCID: PMC5905531PMID: 29899663
