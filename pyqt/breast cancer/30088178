The CT group underwent brain MRI and the NIH Toolbox for Cognition testing prior to adjuvant chemotherapy (time point 1, TP1) and within 1 month afterchemotherapy (time point 2, TP2). The HC group underwent the same assessments at matched intervals. GMD was evaluated with the voxel-based morphometry.RESULTS: The mean age was 67 years in the CT group and 68.5 years in the HCgroup. There was significant GMD reduction within the chemotherapy group from TP1to TP2. Compared to the HC group, the CT group displayed statisticallysignificantly greater GMD reductions from TP1 to TP2 in the brain regionsinvolving the left anterior cingulate gyrus, right insula, and left middletemporal gyrus (pFWE(family-wise error)-corrected < 0.05). The baseline GMD inleft insula was positively correlated with the baseline list-sorting workingmemory score in the HC group (pFWE-corrected < 0.05). No correlation was observedfor the changes in GMD with the changes in cognitive testing scores from TP1 toTP2 (pFWE-corrected < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that GMD reductions were associated withadjuvant chemotherapy in older women with breast cancer. Future studies areneeded to understand the clinical significance of the neuroimaging findings.
