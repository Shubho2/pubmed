Electronic address: tony.ng@kcl.ac.uk.The immunosuppressive transmembrane protein PD-L1 was shown to traffic via themultivesicular body (MVB) and to be released on exosomes. A high-content siRNAscreen identified the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport(ESCRT)-associated protein ALIX as a regulator of both EGFR activity and PD-L1surface presentation in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) cells. ALIX depletionresults in prolonged and enhanced stimulation-induced EGFR activity as well asdefective PD-L1 trafficking through the MVB, reduced exosomal secretion, and its redistribution to the cell surface. Increased surface PD-L1 expression confers anEGFR-dependent immunosuppressive phenotype on ALIX-depleted cells. An inverseassociation between ALIX and PD-L1 expression was observed in human breast cancertissues, while an immunocompetent mouse model of breast cancer revealed thatALIX-deficient tumors are larger and show an increased immunosuppressiveenvironment. Our data suggest that ALIX modulates immunosuppression throughregulation of PD-L1 and EGFR and may, therefore, present a diagnostic andtherapeutic target for BLBC.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).
