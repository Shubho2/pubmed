Of these, twelve (60%) reportedpositive association between RS and QoL, three (15%) studies reported inverseassociations, whereas five (25%) studies showed evidence of lack of association(with two out of the five studies showing an indirect association). Physicalhealth and psychological functioning were the most researched domains of QoL, andsome studies suggest an attachment-based model of RS in the last 10Â years of RSand QoL research. Studies conducted with participants with serious illnessesranging from dementia, cardiac arrest, and breast cancer reported no association between RS and physical health. Our review shows evidence of both the directand/or indirect effects of RS on QoL as a possible spiritual coping model forcomplementary alternative health therapy, albeit occurring through severalreligious-related psychosocial conduits.CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION: RS appears to be associated with health benefits asindicated across QoL domains. General medical practitioners and other healthcare agencies could benefit from the understanding that a spiritual coping model couldaid their patients, and therefore their clinical practices, in the healingprocess.DOI: 10.1186/s12955-018-0895-x PMCID: PMC5926536PMID: 29690887
