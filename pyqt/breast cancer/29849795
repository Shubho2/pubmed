China.Increased expression of Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) has been reported to beassociated with several types of human cancer. Patient-derived cancer xenograftmodels have demonstrated great potential in preclinical studies. In the presentstudy, the link between GOLPH3 expression and survival was examined in patientswith non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patient-derived lung cancer xenograftmodels were established with two different methods. Lastly, the associationbetween GOLPH3 expression and establishment of the xenograft models was explored.Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) andimmunohistochemistry analysis were used to examine GOLPH3 expression in 60 NSCLC tissues and matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANT). In addition, tumorpieces from the 60 NSCLC tissues were implanted in the subcutaneous layer and in the subrenal kidney capsule of nude mice. RT-qPCR, histopathology andimmunohistochemistry were used to confirm the human origin of the xenografttumors. RT-qPCR was also used to research the mutation status of GOLPH3 in thexenograft tumors. The results demonstrated that NSCLC tissues had higherexpression of GOLPH3, at the mRNA and protein level, compared with ANT. Highexpression of GOLPH3 correlated with poor survival in patients with NSCLC.Successful engraftment was established for 27 tissues in the subrenal kidneycapsule and for 16 in the subcutaneous layer of nude mice. The subrenal kidneycapsule group demonstrated significantly higher engraftment rates than thesubcutaneous layer group. In addition, higher GOLPH3 expression in the tumortissues was significantly correlated with higher engraftment rates in mice. Inboth groups, few xenografts lost the GOLPH3 mutation. In summary, GOLPH3 may bean important diagnosis and prognosis indicator in patients with NSCLC. Thegenotype and phenotype of the xenograft tumors derived from patient lung cancertissues exhibited significant similarities to the originating primary tumors.High GOLPH3 expression may promote the successful establishment of xenograftmodels for NSCLC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8340 PMCID: PMC5962867PMID: 29849795
