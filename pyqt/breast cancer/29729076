By binding to the epithelial tumor suppressor CDH1 gene,Snail1 initiates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The EMT generatesstem-like cells and promotes invasiveness during cancer progression. Accordingly,Snail1 mRNA and protein is abundantly expressed in triple-negative breast cancerswith enhanced metastatic potential and phenotypic signs of the EMT. Such highendogenous Snail1 protein levels permit quantitative chromatinimmunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis. Snail1 associated with 185genes at cis regulatory regions in the Hs578T triple-negative breast cancer cell model. These genes include morphogenetic regulators and signaling components thatcontrol polarized differentiation. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in Hs578T cells, a double deletion of 10 bp each was engineered into the first exon and into thesecond exon-intron junction of Snail1, suppressing Snail1 expression and causing misregulation of several hundred genes. Specific attention to regulators ofchromatin organization provides a possible link to new phenotypes uncovered bythe Snail1 loss-of-function mutation. On the other hand, genetic inactivation of Snail1 was not sufficient to establish a full epithelial transition to thesetumor cells. Thus, Snail1 contributes to the malignant phenotype of breast cancercells via diverse new mechanisms.© 2018 The Authors.
