This model was developed for multiple purposes,including to quantify the impact of screening and adjuvant therapy on past andcurrent trends, predict future trends, and evaluate potential outcomes underhypothetical screening and treatment interventions. The model first generates thelife histories of individual breast cancer patients by determining the patient's age, tumor size, estrogen receptor (ER) status, human epidermal growth factor 2(HER2) status, SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) historic stage,detection mode at time of detection, preclinical tumor course, and death age and cause of death (breast cancer v. other causes). The model incorporates commoninputs used by the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network(CISNET), including the dissemination patterns for screening mammography, breast cancer survival in the absence of adjuvant therapy, dissemination and efficacy oftreatment by ER and HER2 status, and death from causes other than breast cancer. In this article, predicted mortality outcomes are compared assuming proportional v. nonproportional hazards effects of treatment on breast cancer survival. Wefound that the proportional hazards treatment effects are sufficient forER-negative disease. However, for ER-positive disease, the treatment effectsappear to be higher during the early years following diagnosis and then diminish over time. Using nonproportional hazards effects for ER-positive cases, thepredicted breast cancer mortality rates closely match the SEER mortality trendsfrom 1975 to 2010, particularly after 1995. Our work indicates thatpopulation-level simulation modeling may have a broader role in assessing thetime dependence of treatment effects.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X17737508 PMID: 29554473
