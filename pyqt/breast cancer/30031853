Blokhin National Medical Research Center of Oncology, Kashirskoye Shosse 24, Moscow 115478, Russia.New 3,20-dihydroxy-13α-19-norpregna-1,3,5(10)-trienes were synthesized. Theeffects of these compounds on breast cancer cells and ERα activation wereinvestigated. The scaffold of compounds containing the six-membered ring D'annulated at 16α,17α-positions was constructed via the Lewis acid catalyzedDiels-Alder reaction of butadiene with3-methoxy-13α-19-norpregna-1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-20-one 5 under a pressure of600 MPa. The hydrogenation of primary cyclohexene adduct 6 followed by theone-pot reduction-demethylation (DIBAH) gave target epimeric 3,20-dihydroxysteroids 8a and 8b. The Corey-Chaykovsky reaction of the same conjugated ketone 5gave a 16α,17α-methylene-substituted compound. The reaction of the latter withDIBAH yielded3,20(R,S)-dihydroxy-16α,17α-methyleno-13α-19-norpregna-1,3,5(10)-triene 10. Thehydrogenation of the 16,17-double bond of compound 5 produced a mixture of 17α-and 17β-epimeric ketones, reduction-demethylation of which gave3,20(S)-dihydroxy-13α,17α-19-norpregna-1,3,5(10)-triene 12a and3,20(R)-dihydroxy-13α,17β-19-norpregna-1,3,5(10)-triene 12b. All compounds werefully characterized by 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, and X-ray diffraction. All targetcompounds showed pronounced cytotoxic effect against MCF-7 breast cancer cellsand NCI/ADR-RES doxorubicin-resistant cells at micromolar concentrations. TheERα-mediated luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that all compounds,except for compound 10, are ERα inhibitors, while cyclopropane compound 10 provedto be an ERα activator. Docking experiments showed that all compounds are wellaccommodated to LBD ERα but have some differences in the binding mode.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
