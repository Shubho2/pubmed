Breast composition/fibroglandular tissue and findings on DBT (two readers)and MRI were reported using BI-RADS 5th edition. Digital mammography images were analysed for breast percent density (PD) using the Libra software tool.RESULTS: A majority of women had dense breasts as categorised by breastcomposition c (heterogeneously dense) (68%) and d (extremely dense) (15%). Themean PD was 44% (range, 18-89%) and the correlation between breast compositionand PD was r = 0.6. The diagnostic performance of MRI was significantly highercompared to DBT for one reader as described by the area under the receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curve (p = 0.004) and of borderline significancefor the other reader (p = 0.052).CONCLUSIONS: MRI had higher diagnostic performance than DBT in a dense breastpopulation in the tertiary setting.KEY POINTS: • MRI had higher diagnostic performance than DBT in a dense breastpopulation • Diagnostic performance of DBT was comparable to MRI in women withfatty breasts • MRI was superior to DBT in preoperative breast cancer sizeassessment.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-017-5297-7 PMCID: PMC6028836PMID: 29460074
