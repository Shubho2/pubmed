Previous studies showed that theexpression of TSPO protein correlated positively with tumour malignancy andnegatively with patient survival. The aim of this study was to determine thetranscription of Tspo mRNA in various types of normal and cancer tissues. In situhybridization was performed to localise the Tspo mRNA in various human normal andcancer tissues. The relative level of Tspo mRNA was quantified using fluorescent intensity and visual estimation of colorimetric staining. RT-PCR was used toconfirm these mRNA levels in normal lung, lung cancer, liver cancer, and cervicalcancer cell lines. There was a significant increase in the level of transcriptionin liver, prostate, kidney, and brain cancers while a significant decrease wasobserved in cancers of the colon and lung. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that themRNA levels of Tspo are higher in a normal lung cell line than in a lung cancercell line. An increase in the expression levels of Tspo mRNA is not necessarily agood diagnostic biomarker in most cancers with changes not being large enough to be significantly different when detected by in situ hybridisation.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19082176 PMID: 30044440
