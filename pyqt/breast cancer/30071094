Although the primarypurpose of RNA-seq is to quantify the expression level of known genes, RNAvariants are also identifiable. However, care must be taken to account for RNA's dynamic nature. In this study, we evaluated the following popular splice-awarealignment algorithms in the context of RNA variant-calling analysis: HISAT2,STAR, STAR (two-pass mode), Subread, and Subjunc. For this, we performed RNA-seq with ten pieces of invasive ductal carcinoma from breast tissue and three pieces of adjacent normal tissue from a single patient. These RNA-seq data were used to evaluate the performance of splice-aware aligners. Surprisingly, the number ofcommon potential RNA editing sites (pRESs) identified by all alignment algorithmswas less than 2% of the total. The main cause of this difference was the mappedreads on the splice junctions. In addition, the RNA quality significantlyaffected the outcome. Therefore, researchers must consider these experimental andbioinformatic features during RNA variant analysis. Further investigations ofcommon pRESs discovered that BDH1, CCDC137, and TBC1D10A transcripts contained a single non-synonymous RNA variant that was unique to breast cancer tissuecompared to adjacent normal tissue; thus, further clinical validation isrequired.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201822 PMID: 30071094
