Research on current pharmacological,psychological, and rehabilitative approaches to treatment is considered, as arethe implications of the research for best practices. Itconcludes with adiscussion of directions that future research and treatment might take to reduce the incidence and impact of PPMP on breast cancer survivors.PERSPECTIVE: Thisarticle describes current research literature involving mechanisms, risks, andtreatments related to post-mastectomy pain syndrome. Implications of researchfindings for pre- and post-surgical approaches to pain management, currenttreatments, and promising research directions also are discussed.Copyright Â© 2018.
