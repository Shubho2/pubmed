The objective of this prospective cohort study is to evaluateassociations between whole and refined grains and their food sources in relation to adiposity-related cancer risk. Participants were adults from the FraminghamOffspring cohort (N = 3,184; â‰¥18 yr). Diet, measured using a food frequencyquestionnaire, medical and lifestyle data were collected at exam 5 (1991-95).Between 1991 and 2013, 565 adiposity-related cancers were ascertained usingpathology reports. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjustedhazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for associations of whole and refined grains with risk of adiposity-related cancers combined and with risk of breastand prostate cancers in exploratory site-specific analyses. Null associationsbetween whole and refined grains and combined incidence of adiposity-relatedcancers were observed in multivariable-adjusted models (HR: 0.94; 95% CI:0.71-1.23 and HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.70-1.38, respectively). In exploratoryanalyses, higher intakes of whole grains (oz eq/day) and whole grain food sources(servings/day) were associated with 39% and 47% lower breast cancer risk (HR:0.61; 95% CI: 0.38-0.98 and HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.33-0.86, respectively). Inconclusion, whole and refined grains were not associated with adiposity-relatedcancer risk. Whole grains may protect against breast cancer, but findings requireconfirmation within a larger sample and in other ethnic groups.DOI: 10.1080/01635581.2018.1470647 PMID: 29781707
