We therefore examined the relationships between healthybehaviours: low alcohol intake, non-smoking, healthy BMI, physical activity and ahealthy diet, and the risk of all cancers, colon, breast and prostate cancers in a large dataset.Method: Data on lifestyle behaviours were provided by 343,150 subjects, andheight and weight were measured at recruitment. 14,285 subjects were diagnosedwith cancer during a median of 5.1 years of follow-up.Results: Compared with subjects who followed none or a single healthy behaviour, a healthy lifestyle based on all five behaviours was associated with a reduction of about one-third in incident cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68; 95% confidenceintervals [CI] 0.63-0.74). Colorectal cancer was reduced in subjects followingthe five behaviours by about one-quarter (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.58-0.97), and breast cancer by about one-third (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.52-0.83). The association between a healthy lifestyle and prostate cancer suggested a significant increase in risk,but this can be attributed to bias consequent on inequalities in the uptake ofthe prostate specific antigen screening test.Conclusions: Taken together with reported reductions in diabetes, vasculardisease and dementia, it is clearly important that every effort is taken topromote healthy lifestyles throughout the population, and it is pointed out that cancer and other screening clinics afford 'teachable moments' for the promotionof a healthy lifestyle.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.792 PMCID: PMC5804718PMID: 29434658
