Cancer prevention andtherapy through the use of phytochemicals that have epigenetic properties hasgained considerable interest during the past few decades. Such dietary componentsinclude, but are not limited to, grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) andresveratrol (Res), both of which are present in red wine. In this study, wereport for the first time the synergistic effects of GSPs and Res on inhibitingMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Our results of3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays andclonogenic assays indicate that treatments with the combinations of GSPs and Res synergistically decreased cell viability and posttreatment cell proliferation in both cell lines. Additional analyses show that treatments with GSPs and Res incombination synergistically induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells by upregulatingBax expression and down-regulating Bcl-2 expression. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)activity and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity were greatly reduced inMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells after treatments with GSPs and Res in combination.Collectively, our findings suggest that GSPs and Res synergistically inhibithuman breast cancer cells through inducing apoptosis, as well as modulating DNAmethylation and histone modifications.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19082204 PMID: 30060527
