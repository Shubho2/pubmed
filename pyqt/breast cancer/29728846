Healthcare provider participants filled out pre- and post-surveysassessing knowledge and attitudes surrounding yoga and meditation classes.RESULTS: A total of 40 healthcare providers were surveyed, consisting of 18physicians, 12 nurses, six nurse practitioners, two physician assistants, onepharmacist, and one clinical researcher. Of these 40 healthcare providers, 43%were unaware at baseline that yoga and meditation classes were offered throughthe cancer center and 55% responded that they rarely or never recommend yoga ormeditation for patients. Following a brief presentation about the benefits ofyoga and meditation for cancer patients, 90% of providers stated they would bemore likely to recommend these services to patients in the future. There was asignificant (p < 0.01) increase in providers from pre- to post-presentation (65to 85%) stating they strongly believe yoga and meditation can provide physical oremotional benefits for their patients.SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: These data demonstrate that a brief educationalintervention about yoga and meditation for cancer patients is effective atsignificantly increasing provider knowledge about the benefits of thesetherapeutic modalities, with a majority indicating they are more likely torecommend these services in the future. Increasing provider awareness regardingthe health-promoting benefits of such supportive services for cancer patientscould result in greater service utilization as well as physical and emotionalbenefits for patients.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4220-3 PMID: 29728846
