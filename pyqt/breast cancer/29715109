Herein we aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms byanalysing the expression and activation of proteins involved in cellular stressand apoptosis signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight Isa Brown laying hens (26-week-old) were fed afortified (0.75% CLA) or a control diet (0% CLA) for 4 months. Collected eggswere used to obtain CLA-enriched (EFA-CLA) or non-enriched (EFA) fatty acidextracts for the treatment of the MCF-7 cancer cell line. Protein levels wereanalysed by PathScan® Stress and Apoptosis Signalling Antibody Array and western blot method.RESULTS: Treatment with EFA-CLA led to activation of caspase signalling as maineffector of apoptosis. It also increased levels of pro-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 family proteins as well as promoted the release of cytochrome c, secondmitochondria-derived activator of caspase and mitochondrial serine protease from mitochondria to the cytoplasm. EFA-CLA increased levels of tumour protein 53 and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 tumour suppressors, and activated p38mitogen-activated protein kinases and stress-activated protein kinase/c-JunNH2-terminal kinase proteins. Finally, treatment down-regulated anti-apoptoticextracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2, RAC-alphaserine/threonine-protein kinase, heat-shock protein 27, inhibitor of nuclearfactor κβ, transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 and survivinproteins.CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that activation of themitochondrial apoptotic pathway may be a potential mechanism of EFA-CLA action.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12531 PMID: 29715109  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
