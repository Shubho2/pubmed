Many methods have been developed for the treatment andprevention of this disease. Determining the expression patterns of certain targetgenes in specific subtypes of breast cancer is important for developing newtherapies for breast cancer. In the present study, we performed a holisticapproach to screening the mRNA expression of six members of the cell divisioncycle-associated gene family (CDCA) with a focus on breast cancer using theOncomine and The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) databases. Furthermore,Gene Expression-Based Outcome for Breast Cancer Online (GOBO) was also used todeeply mine the expression of each CDCA gene in clinical breast cancer tissue andbreast cancer cell lines. Finally, the mRNA expression of the CDCA genes asrelated to breast cancer patient survival were analyzed using a Kaplan-Meierplot. CDCA3, CDCA5, and CDCA8 mRNA expression levels were significantly higherthan the control sample in both clinical tumor sample and cancer cell lines.These highly expressed genes in the tumors of breast cancer patients dramaticallyreduced patient survival. The interaction network of CDCA3, CDCA5, and CDCA8 withtheir co-expressed genes also revealed that CDCA3 expression was highlycorrelated with cell cycle related genes such as CCNB2, CDC20, CDKN3, and CCNB1. CDCA5 expression was correlated with BUB1 and TRIP13, while CDCA8 expression was correlated with BUB1 and CCNB1. Altogether, these findings suggested CDCA3,CDCA5, and CDCA8 could have a high potency as targeted breast cancer therapies.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24059 PMCID: PMC5805530PMID: 29467944
