We assessedreoperation rates, long-term patient satisfaction and aesthetic outcome afterdirect-to-implant BR without acellular dermal matrix (ADM) in women with highbreast cancer risk.METHODS: Women who underwent bilateral skin or nipple-sparing mastectomy andimmediate direct-to-implant BR between 1994 and 2006 completed a survey onreoperations and the Breast-Q Reconstruction questionnaire. Photographs takenduring follow-up were rated for long-term aesthetic outcome (scale 1-10) by five plastic surgeons. Outcomes were compared between women who never underwentunanticipated reoperations after immediate BR and women who underwent one or morereoperations, adjusted for potential confounders using multivariable linearregression.RESULTS: Of 143 women, 70 (49%) were never reoperated and 73 (51%) had undergone reoperations. Median follow-up was 12 years in both groups (range 7-17 and6-19 years, respectively). Baseline characteristics were comparable except forhistory of prophylactic oophorectomy with 81% in the no-reoperations group versus66% in the reoperated group (p = .03). Breast-Q scores were 59.7 ± 17.3 versus58.0 ± 17.8 (p = .67) for 'satisfaction with breasts' and 71.1 ± 20.3 versus68.1 ± 22.9 (p = .47) for 'satisfaction with outcome' in the no-reoperationversus reoperation group, respectively. Aesthetic outcome was scored 5.8 ± 1.1 inthe no-reoperation group versus 5.3 ± 1.3 in the reoperation group (p = .01).CONCLUSIONS: The single-stage intent did not prevent unanticipated surgicalreinterventions in 51% of the patients. Long-term patient satisfaction wasreasonable and not affected by reoperations. Aesthetic outcome, however, was onlypoor to reasonable and scores were significantly lower in the reoperated group.DOI: 10.1080/2000656X.2018.1476364 PMID: 29806795
