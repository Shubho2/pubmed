Compounds 13a, 13c, 13d and 20a were the most promising showing high selectivity indices. Compounds 13c and 20a showed potent inhibition oftopoisomerase (topo-I) and kinesin spindle protein (KSP/Eg5 ATPase) which wasconfirmed by their docking results into the active site of both enzymes. Insilico physicochemical calculations predicted that compounds 13a, 13d and 20aobeyed Lipinski's rule of five.CONCLUSION: Compounds 13c and 20a are multitarget anticancer leads that act aspotent inhibitors for both topo-I and/or KSP ATPase.DOI: 10.4155/fmc-2017-0206 PMID: 29787297
