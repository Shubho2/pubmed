An integrated view of sialic acid metabolism was gained by measuring intracellular sialic acidproduction in tandem with transcriptional profiling of genes linked to sialicacid metabolism. The transcriptional profiling showed several differences betweenthe three lines in the absence of ManNAc analog supplementation that helpsexplain the different sialoglycan profiles naturally associated with cancer. Onlyminor changes in mRNA transcript levels occurred upon exposure to the compoundsconfirming that metabolic flux alone can be a key determinant ofsialoglycoconjugate display in breast cancer cells; this result complements thewell-established role of genetic control (e.g., the transcription of STs) ofsialylation abnormalities ubiquitously associated with cancer. A notable resultwas that the different cell lines produced significantly different levels ofsialic acid upon exogenous ManNAc supplementation, indicating that feedbackinhibition of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase (GNE)-generally regarded asthe 'gatekeeper' enzyme for titering flux into sialic acid biosynthesis-is notthe only regulatory mechanism that limits production of this sugar. A notableaspect of our metabolic glycoengineering approach is its ability to discriminate cell subtype based on intracellular metabolism by illuminating otherwise hiddencell type-specific features. We believe that this strategy combined withmulti-dimensional analysis of sialic acid metabolism will ultimately providenovel insights into breast cancer subtypes and provide a foundation for newmethods of diagnosis.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195812 PMCID: PMC5976204PMID: 29847599  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
