[Epub aheadof print]High-Resolution X-ray Phase-Contrast 3D Imaging of Breast Tissue Specimens as aPossible Adjunct to Histopathology.Baran P, Mayo S, McCormack M, Pacile S, Tromba G, Dullin C, Zanconati F, Arfelli F, Dreossi D, Fox J, Prodanovic Z, Cholewa M, Quiney H, Dimmock M, Nesterets Y,Thompson D, Brennan P, Gureyev T.THistopathological analysis is the current gold standard in breast cancerdiagnosis and management, however, as imaging technology improves, the amount of potential diagnostic information that may be demonstrable radiologically shouldalso increase. We aimed to evaluate the potential clinical usefulness of 3Dphase-contrast micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging at high spatialresolutions as an adjunct to conventional histological microscopy. Ten breasttissue specimens, 2 mm in diameter, were scanned at the SYRMEP beamline of theElettra Synchrotron using the propagation-based phase-contrast micro-tomographymethod. We obtained 1.2 Ã¬m pixel size images, which were analysed and comparedwith corresponding histological sections examined under light microscopy. Toevaluate the effect of spatial resolution on breast cancer diagnosis, scans with 4 different pixel sizes were also performed. Our comparative analysis revealedthat high-resolution images can enable, at a near-histological level, detailedarchitectural assessment of tissue that may permit increased breast cancerdiagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared with current imagingpractices. The potential clinical applications of this method are also discussed.DOI: 10.1109/TMI.2018.2845905 PMID: 29994112
