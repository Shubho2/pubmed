This study evaluated the rate andpredictive factors of CPM patients who underwent multigene panel testing. Threehundred and fourteen patients with breast cancer who underwent multigene paneltesting between 2014 and 2017 were included in the analysis. Of the 314 patients,70 elected CPM. Election of CPM by gene status was as follows: BRCA carriers(42.3%), non-BRCA carriers (30.1%), and VUS (10.6%). CPM election rates did notdiffer between non-BRCA carriers and BRCA carriers (P = 0.6205). Among non-BRCAcarriers, negative hormone receptor status was associated with CPM (P = 0.0115). For those with a VUS, hormone receptor status was not associated with CPM(P = 0.1879). Although the rate of CPM between BRCA carriers and non-BRCAcarriers was not significantly different, the predictors of CPM were different ineach group. Our analyses shed the light on the increasing use of CPM amongpatients who are non-BRCA carriers as well those with a VUS. Our study elucidatesthe differing predictive factors of CPM election among BRCA carriers, non-BRCAcarries, and those with a VUS. Our findings reveal the need for providers to becognizant that non-BRCA genes and VUS drive women to elect CPM despite the lackof data for contralateral breast cancer risk associated with these genes.© 2018 The Authors.
