The current extent of cancer screening in this population is unknown. Primary care (PC)reminder systems or performance incentives may encourage indiscriminate cancerscreening. We compared rates of cancer screening in patients with ESRD, with and without PC visits. This is a retrospective cohort study using United States RenalData System (USRDS) billing data and electronic medical record data. Patientsaged ≥18 years starting dialysis from 2001 to 2008, Midwest regional dialysisnetwork were categorized with or without a PC visit (defined as an office visitin family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, geriatrics or preventivemedicine during the first two years of dialysis). Cancer screening was based onCurrent Procedural Terminology codes in USRDS. We identified 2512 incidentdialysis patients (60% men, median age 65y). Cancer screening rates were morefrequent among those seen in PC: 38% vs 19% (P = 0.0002), for breast; 18% vs 10% (P = 0.047) for cervical; 13% versus 8% (P = 0.024) for prostate; and 18% vs 9%(P = 0.0002) for colon cancer. Multivariable analyses found that those with PCwere more likely to be screened after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. In our practice, cancer screening rates among chronic dialysis patients are lowerthan those previously reported for our general population (64% for breastcancer). However, a sizeable proportion of our ESRD population does receivecancer screening, especially those still seen in primary care.DOI: 10.1016/j.pmedr.2018.03.006 PMCID: PMC5984226PMID: 29868364
