[Epub ahead of print]Simultaneous downregulation of miR-21 and miR-155 through oleuropein for breastcancer prevention and therapy.Abtin M(1)(2), Alivand MR(2), Khaniani MS(2), Bastami M(2), Zaeifizadeh M(3),Derakhshan SM(1)(2).Author information: (1)Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz,Iran.(2)Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University ofMedical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.(3)Department of Genetic, Ardabil Branch Islamic Azad University, Ardabil, Iran.Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide.It recently was proven that miRNAs play a critical role in BC development. Theuse of natural agents for control of cancer by modulating miRNAs is promising.Oleuropein is a natural polyphenolic agent with anti-neoplastic properties and iswell tolerated by humans. This study was undertaken to determine the therapeutic effects of oleuropein through modulation of master oncomiRs (miR-21 and miR-155) in BC cells. The present study provides the first link between miRNA andoleuropein as a mechanism in BC. MCF-7 cells were tested with and withoutoleuropein and the cell viability, apoptosis, and migration were examined. Theeffect of oleuropein on miR-21 and miR-155 expression was assessed throughqRT-PCR. It was found that oleuropein induced apoptosis and retarded cellmigration and invasion in a dose-dependent manner in the human MCF7 BC cell line.It was observed that oleuropein significantly decreased expression of both miR-21and miR-155 over time in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that oleuropein is a potential therapeutic and preventive agent for BC. Oleuropeinexhibits an anti-cancer effect by modulation of tumor suppressor gene expression,which is targeted by oncomiRs.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcb.26754 PMID: 29905007
