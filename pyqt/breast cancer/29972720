[Epub ahead of print]FOXA1 levels are decreased in pleural breast cancer metastases after adjuvantendocrine therapy, and this is associated with poor outcome.Schrijver W(1), Schuurman K(2), van Rossum A(3), Droog M(2), Jeronimo C(4), SaltaS(4), Henrique R(5), Wesseling J(6), Moelans C(1), Linn SC(1)(3)(7), van deHeuvel M(8), van Diest P(1), Zwart W(2)(9).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan100, 3508 GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands.(2)Division of Oncogenomics, Oncode Institute, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.(3)Division of Molecular Pathology, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan121, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.(4)Cancer Biology and Epigenetics Group, Research Center (CI-IPOP), PortugueseOncology Institute of Porto, Porto, Portugal.(5)Department of Pathology, Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto (IPO Porto),Porto, Portugal.(6)Division of Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.(7)Division of Medical Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan121, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.(8)Division of thoracic Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan121, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.(9)Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Institute for Complex Molecular Systems,Department of Biomedical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, PO Box 513, 5600MB, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-driven early breast cancer is often treated withantihormonal regimens. However, resistance to treatment is common, leading tometastatic disease. ERα activity requires the functional involvement of pioneerfactors FOXA1 and GATA3, which enable ERα chromatin binding and are crucial forERα-driven cell proliferation. FOXA1 was found increased in metastatic breastcancers in relation to the primary tumor, but a comprehensive clinical assessmentthereof, in relation to different metastatic sites and endocrine therapy usage,is currently lacking. Prior cell line-based reports, however, have revealed that FOXA1 is required for tamoxifen-resistant tumor cell proliferation. We studiedexpression levels of ERα, GATA3 and FOXA1 by immunohistochemistry in samples fromboth primary tumors and various metastatic sites. For all factors, expressionlevels varied between the metastatic sites. For pleural metastases, strongvariation was found in FOXA1 and GATA3 levels. Although GATA3 levels remainedunaltered between primary breast cancer and pleural metastases, FOXA1 levels werereduced exclusively in metastases of patients who received endocrine therapies inthe adjuvant setting, even though ERα was still expressed. Importantly, decreasedFOXA1 levels in pleural metastases correlated with hormone irresponsiveness inthe palliative setting, while no such correlation was found for GATA3. With this,we show divergent clinical correlations of the two ERα pioneer factors FOXA1 and GATA3 in metastatic breast cancer, where endocrine therapy resistance wasassociated with decreased FOXA1 levels in pleural metastases.
