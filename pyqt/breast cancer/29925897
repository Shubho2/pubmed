Thepurpose of the current study was to investigate the function of miR-182 intrastuzumab resistance in breast cancer cells. The results showed that bothbreast cancer SKBR3 trastuzumab-resistant cells (SKBR3/TR) and BT474trastuzumab-resistant cells (BT474/TR) were associated with miR-182downregulation compared with their parental cells. Ectopic expression of themiR-182 mimic inhibited trastuzumab resistance, decreasing the invasion andmigration of these trastuzumab-resistant cells. However, the miR-182 inhibitorincreased trastuzumab resistance, cell invasion, and migration in the parentalcells. In addition, MET is a directly targeted gene of miR-182 in breast cancercells. MET knockdown showed an inhibitory effect of trastuzumab resistance ontrastuzumab-resistant cells. In contrast, MET overexpression in SKBR3 cellsproduced an effect that promotes resistance to trastuzumab. Moreover, we revealedthat overexpression of miR-182 reduced trastuzumab resistance intrastuzumab-resistant cells due in part to MET/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathwayinactivation. Furthermore, miR-182 could also sensitize SKBR3/TR cells totrastuzumab in vivo. In conclusion, our results suggest that the activation ofmiR-182 or inactivation of its target gene pathway could be used as a new method to reverse trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41417-018-0031-4 PMID: 29925897
