However, patients with breast cancer oftenfail to respond for tamoxifen therapy due to the development of a drug-resistant phenotype. Functional analysis and molecular studies suggest that proteinmutation and dysregulation of survival signaling molecules such as epidermalgrowth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and Aktcontribute to tamoxifen resistance. Various strategies, including combinatorialtherapies, show chemosensitize tamoxifen-resistant cancers. Based onchemotoxicity issues, researchers are actively investigating alternativetherapeutic strategies. In the current study, we fabricate a mesoporous silicagold cluster nanodrug delivery system that displays exceptional tumor-targetingcapability, thus promoting accretion of drug indices at the tumor site. We employdual drugs, ZD6474, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) that inhibit EGFR2,VEGFR2, and Akt signaling pathways since changes in these signaling pathwaysconfer tamoxifen resistance in MCF 7 and T-47D cells. Mesoporous silica goldcluster nanodrug delivery of ZD6474 and EGCG sensitize tamoxifen-resistant cells to apoptosis. Western and immune-histochemical analyses confirmed the apoptoticinducing properties of the nanoformulation. Overall, results with these silicagold nanoclusters suggest that they may be a potent nanoformulation againstchemoresistant cancers.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00218 PMID: 29787277
