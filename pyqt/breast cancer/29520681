We often encounter difficulties in choosingthe most appropriate treatments, with optimal timing, for individual patients.Everolimus, one of the mTOR inhibitors, is usually used with endocrine therapyfor MBC. Identification of predictive markers for everolimus-based treatmentremains a major issue, but to date, no predictive markers have been established. We retrospectively investigated predictive markers for treatments with everolimusplus exemestane in patients with ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.Clinicopathological features of 18 patients, with locally advanced disease or MBCgiven everolimus plus exemestane treatments, were examined in relation totreatment effects. Also, primary breast cancer specimens, all ER positive andHER2 negative, were immunohistochemically investigated for phospho-S6 (pS6) andPTEN, to evaluate the mTOR and PIK3CA/Akt pathways. Those showing a good clinicalresponse had a significantly lower Ki67 labeling index than the poor responders. A similar trend was observed in pS6 level but without statistical significance.Interestingly, there was no correlation between the Ki67 labeling index and pS6, and when both indexes were low, the good clinical response rate was high. Themedian progression-free survival was longer in the group showing a low Ki67labeling index (109 weeks) than in that with high Ki67 (19 weeks). There was notrend between PTEN expression and treatment effects. Our results suggest that theprimary tumor in luminal HER2-negative breast cancer patients with a low Ki67labeling index and pS6 level has the potential to respond well to everolimus plusexemestane.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1112-9 PMID: 29520681
