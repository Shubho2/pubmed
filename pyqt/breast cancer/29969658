This studyinvestigates the role of lncRNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) intamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. A microarray of lncRNAs was screened intamoxifen-resistant MCF-7R cells and the parental, non-resistant MCF-7 cells.Downregulation of lncRNA GAS5 was found in MCF-7R cells. Besides, decreasedexpression of GAS5 was found in breast cancer tissues, which was associated with advanced TNM stage and shorter overall survival time. We further found that GAS5 overexpression enhanced cell sensitivity to tamoxifen in MCF-7R cells both invitro and in vivo. Moreover, GAS5 increased sensitivity of breast cancer cells totamoxifen by serving as a molecular sponge for miR-222, contributing tosuppression of phosphatase and tensin homologs (PTEN) (one endogenous target ofmiR-222). Collectively, our study demonstrates that GAS5 enhances the efficacy oftamoxifen in the treatment of breast cancer and could be a novel prognosticbiomarker.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
