[Epub ahead ofprint]Optimal Reconstruction Method for Large Radionecrosis Following Breast CancerTreatment: Utility of Free Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous Flap UsingContralateral Internal Mammary Artery as Recipient.Ha JH, Park SO(1), Chang H, Jin US.Author information: (1)Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Hanyang University MedicalCenter, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.INTRODUCTION: In extensive radionecrosis following radiotherapy for breast cancer(BC) treatment, the defect after excision can be reconstructed with a transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap. In this study, we report outcome offree TRAM flap using contralateral internal mammary artery (IMA) as a recipientin comparison with pedicled TRAM.METHODS: We reviewed cases of chest wall radionecrosis following BC treatmentduring the past 8 years. Radionecrosis involving full-thickness soft tissue with defect sizes greater than 10 Ã— 10 cm were included. We compared the outcomes ofpatients who underwent reconstruction with either pedicled TRAM flaps or freeTRAM flaps. We used IMA as a recipient for free TRAM flap, whereas we usedcontralateral superior epigastric artery-based flap for pedicled TRAM.RESULTS: A total of 14 BC patients underwent chest wall reconstruction due toradionecrosis: 7 received pedicled TRAM flaps, 5 received free TRAM flaps, and 2 were excluded because of the small defect size. The pedicled and free TRAM groupswere similar in patient demographics and defect size. However, distal flap lossrate was significantly higher in the pedicled TRAM group compared with the freeTRAM group (P = 0.028). There was no difference in abdominal hernia incidencebetween the 2 groups (P = 0.100).CONCLUSIONS: Wide chest wall defects caused by radionecrosis following BCtreatment can be successfully reconstructed with a free TRAM flap that uses acontralateral IMA as a recipient. The free TRAM flap demonstrates a lower rate ofdistal flap loss than the pedicled TRAM flap, hence reduces the risk of severemorbidity.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001547 PMID: 29944531
