We present a case of a woman whopresented to our ophthalmology colleagues with worsening unilateral proptosissecondary to a tumour mass within her ethmoid sinuses. Biopsy of the ethmoidtumour showed adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. Whole-body positron emissioncomputed tomography demonstrated a breast primary lesion. The patient was treatedwith palliative chemotherapy, and the patient remains well at this point. Theimportance of specialist head and neck radiological interpretation of imagingcannot be underestimated. Early tissue diagnosis is essential before ascribingpatients with orbital symptoms to non-malignant process.DOI: 10.1308/rcsann.2018.0065 PMID: 29607722  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
