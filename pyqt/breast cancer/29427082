David.Krag@uvm.edu.A better understanding of antitumor immune responses is the key to advancing the field of cancer immunotherapy. Endogenous immunity in cancer patients, such ascirculating anticancer antibodies or tumor-reactive B cells, has beenhistorically yet incompletely described. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-draining(sentinel) lymph node (SN) is a rich source for tumor-reactive B cells that give rise to systemic IgG anticancer antibodies circulating in the bloodstream ofbreast cancer patients. Using a synergistic combination of high-throughput B-cellsequencing and quantitative immunoproteomics, we describe the prospectiveidentification of tumor-reactive SN B cells (based on clonal frequency) and also demonstrate an unequivocal link between affinity-matured expanded B-cell clonesin the SN and antitumor IgG in the blood. This technology could facilitate thediscovery of antitumor antibody therapeutics and conceivably identify novel tumorantigens. Lastly, these findings highlight the unique and specialized niche theSN can fill in the advancement of cancer immunotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00262-018-2123-2 PMID: 29427082
