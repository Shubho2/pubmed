However, the exact relationship between them is still unknown. Thepresent study aimed to examine the interaction of filamin A with 14-3-3-σ in the invasion and migration of breast cancer. RNA interference technology was employedto silence filamin A in MDA-MB-231 cells. Real-time PCR and Western blotting wereused to detect the expression of filamin A and 14-3-3-σ at mRNA and proteinlevels, respectively. Double immunofluorescence was applied to show theircolocalization morphologically. Wound healing assay and Trans-well assay wereused to testify the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in filaminA-silenced cells. The results showed that silencing filamin A significantlyincreased the mRNA and protein levels of 14-3-3σ. In addition, doubleimmunofluorescence displayed that filamin A and 14-3-3σ were predominantlycolocalized in the cytoplasm of MDA-MB-231 cells. Silencing filamin A led to the enhanced fluorescence of 14-3-3σ. Furthermore, cell functional experiments showedthat silencing filamin A inhibited the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cellsin vitro. In conclusion, silencing filamin A may inhibit the invasion andmigration of breast cancer cells by upregulating 14-3-3σ.DOI: 10.1007/s11596-018-1901-6 PMID: 30074213
