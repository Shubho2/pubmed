Characterizing the evolutionarylandscape of these cancers, including the role of metastatic axillary lymph nodes(ALNs) in seeding distant organ metastasis, can provide a rational basis foreffective treatments. Here, we have described the genomic analyses of the primarytumors and metastatic lesions from 99 samples obtained from 20 patients withbreast cancer. Our evolutionary analyses revealed diverse spreading and seedingpatterns that govern tumor progression. Although linear evolution to successivemetastatic sites was common, parallel evolution from the primary tumor tomultiple distant sites was also evident. Metastatic spreading was frequentlycoupled with polyclonal seeding, in which multiple metastatic subclonesoriginated from the primary tumor and/or other distant metastases. SynchronousALN metastasis, a well-established prognosticator of breast cancer, was notinvolved in seeding the distant metastasis, suggesting a hematogenous route forcancer dissemination. Clonal evolution coincided frequently with emerging driver alterations and evolving mutational processes, notably an increase inapolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like-associated(APOBEC-associated) mutagenesis. Our data provide genomic evidence for a role of ALN metastasis in seeding distant organ metastasis and elucidate the evolvingmutational landscape during cancer progression.DOI: 10.1172/JCI96149 PMCID: PMC5873882PMID: 29480816
