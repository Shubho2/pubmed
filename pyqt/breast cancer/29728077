RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR wereconducted to identify differentially expressed genes. The role of an upregulated oncogene, Tenascin C (TNC) and its associated pathway was investigated bysiRNA-mediated knockdown. Resistant variants of the control and BT-474 NRP-1cells were generated by sequential treatment with four cycles ofAdriamycin/Cyclophosphamide (4xAC) followed by four cycles of Paclitaxel(4xAC + 4xPAC).RESULTS: NRP-1 overexpression increased cellular tumorigenic behavior. RNAsequencing identified upregulation of an oncogene, Tenascin-C (TNC) anddownregulation of several tumor suppressors in BT-474 NRP-1 cells. Additionally, protein analysis indicated activation of the TNC-associated integrin β3 (ITGB3)pathway via focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Akt (Ser473) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) p65. siRNA-mediated TNC knockdown ablated the migratory capacity ofBT-474 NRP-1 cells and inactivated FAK/Akt473 signaling. NRP-1 overexpressingcells downregulated breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2). Consequently, sequential treatment with Adriamycin/Cyclophosphamide (AC) cytotoxic drugs togenerate resistant cells indicated that BT-474 NRP-1 cells increased sensitivity to treatment by inactivating NRP-1/ITGB3/FAK/Akt/NF-kB p65 signaling compared to wild-type BT-474 resistant cells.CONCLUSIONS: We thus report a novel mechanism correlating high baseline NRP-1with upregulated TNC/ITGB3 signaling, but decreased ABCG2 expression, whichsensitizes BT-474 NRP-1 cells to Adriamycin/Cyclophosphamide. The studyemphasizes on the targetability of the NRP-1/ITGB3 axis and its potential as apredictive biomarker for chemotherapy response.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4446-y PMCID: PMC5935908PMID: 29728077
