NAC preserving strategies inthis subgroup include staged or simultaneous NSM and reduction mastopexy. Wepresent a novel approach towards simultaneous NSM and reduction mastopexy inpatients with large, ptotic breasts.Methods: Literature pertaining to NSM for women with large, ptotic breasts wasreviewed and a surgical approach was designed to allow for simultaneous NSM andreduction mastopexy in such patients.Results: Eight patients underwent bilateral NSM with simultaneous reductionmammaplasty and immediate reconstruction. The majority of breasts demonstratedadvanced ptosis (69% grade III, 31% grade II) and the average breast volumeexcised was 760 grams. In those patients without a history of smoking, NACnecrosis rates were 0%. In those patients with a history of smoking, 83% ofbreasts experienced NAC necrosis (60% total, 40% partial). One hundred percent ofpatients who smoked experienced some degree of NAC necrosis. Among breasts withgrade II versus grade III ptosis, NAC necrosis rates were roughly equal.Conclusions: Historically, patients with large, ptotic breasts were excluded fromNSM due to the proposed increased risk of NAC necrosis. This study demonstrates asafe approach towards NSM and reduction mastopexy using an inferior, wide-based, epithelialized pedicle. While all patients eventually achieved satisfactoryresults, there was an association between smoking and NAC necrosis. Smokingcessation is paramount to the operation's success.DOI: 10.1155/2018/9205805 PMCID: PMC5867609PMID: 29725545
