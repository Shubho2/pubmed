China.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer‑associatedmortality in the 21st century. microRNA (miR)‑23b has been shown to be involvedin the pathogenesis of many cancers, including breast and prostate cancer.However, the role of miR‑23b in HCC remains unclear. The present study revealed anegative correlation between miR‑23b expression in HCC tissues and progression ofcarcinomas. Compared to normal tissues, miR‑23b expression was significantlydownregulated in HCC tissues, whereas the expression of interleukin (IL)‑11 andIL‑11 receptor α (IL‑11Rα) was significantly upregulated, indicating that miR‑23bexpression is negatively correlated with IL‑11 and IL‑11Rα expression. Inaddition, miR‑23b inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of SMMC‑7721cells. This effect was mediated by IL‑11, which was found to be the direct targetof miR‑23b in this study. These results indicated that miR‑23b regulates IL‑11and IL‑11Rα expression, and might act as an anti‑oncogenic agent in theprogression of HCC by directly downregulating IL‑11 expression.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9151 PMCID: PMC6072194PMID: 29901200
