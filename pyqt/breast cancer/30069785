This study quantitatively evaluated intratumoralheterogeneity through a histogram analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI(DCE-MRI) pharmacokinetic parameters, and determined correlations with prognosticfactors and molecular subtypes.METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 101 invasive ductal breast cancers from 99 women who underwent preoperative DCE-MRI between July 2012 and November 2014. Pharmacokinetic parameters (Ktrans, kep, and ve) were obtained by the Toftsmodel. For each parameter, the mean, standard deviation, coefficient ofvariation, skewness, and kurtosis values of tumor were calculated, and prognosticfactors and subtypes associations were assessed.RESULTS: The mean of ve was lower in cancers with high Ki-67 than in cancers withlow Ki-67 (P = 0.002). The coefficient of variation of ve was higher in cancerswith estrogen receptor negativity than in cancers with estrogen receptorpositivity (P < 0.001). The coefficient of variation of ve was also higher incancers with high Ki-67 than in cancers with low Ki-67 (P < 0.001). The skewness of ve was higher in cancers with high nuclear grade than in cancers with lownuclear grade (P = 0.006). Triple-negative cancers showed higher ve coefficientof variation than did those with luminal A (P < 0.001) and B (P = 0.006).CONCLUSIONS: Various ve parameters correlated with breast cancer prognosticfactors and molecular subtypes.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0899-8 PMID: 30069785
