The majority of older patients with breast cancerself-report cognitive problems during and after chemotherapy. Prior neuroimaging research has been performed mostly in younger patients with cancer. The purposeof this study was to evaluate longitudinal changes in brain volumes and cognitionin older women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: Women aged ≥ 60 years with stage I-III breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. All participants underwent neuropsychological testing with the US National Institutesof Health (NIH) Toolbox for Cognition and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to chemotherapy, and again around one month after the last infusion ofchemotherapy. Brain volumes were measured using Neuroreader™ software.Longitudinal changes in brain volumes and neuropsychological scores were analyzedutilizing linear mixed models.RESULTS: A total of 16 patients with breast cancer (mean age 67.0, SD 5.39 years)and 14 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls (mean age 67.8, SD5.24 years) were included: 7 patients received docetaxel and cyclophosphamide(TC) and 9 received chemotherapy regimens other than TC (non-TC). There were nosignificant differences in segmented brain volumes between the healthy controlgroup and the chemotherapy group pre-chemotherapy (p > 0.05). Exploratoryhypothesis generating analyses focusing on the effect of the chemotherapy regimendemonstrated that the TC group had greater volume reduction in the temporal lobe (change = - 0.26) compared to the non-TC group (change = 0.04, p forinteraction = 0.02) and healthy controls (change = 0.08, p forinteraction = 0.004). Similarly, the TC group had a decrease in oral readingrecognition scores (change = - 6.94) compared to the non-TC group(change = - 1.21, p for interaction = 0.07) and healthy controls (change = 0.09, p for interaction = 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in segmented brain volumesbetween the healthy control group and the chemotherapy group; however,exploratory analyses demonstrated a reduction in both temporal lobe volume andoral reading recognition scores among patients on the TC regimen. These resultssuggest that different chemotherapy regimens may have differential effects onbrain volume and cognition. Future, larger studies focusing on older adults with cancer on different treatment regimens are needed to confirm these findings.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01992432 .
