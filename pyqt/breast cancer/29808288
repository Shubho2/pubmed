Thirty-one patients received adjuvantradiation therapy (RT), and those who received adjuvant chemotherapy wereexcluded from the study.RESULTS: Median follow-up was 5 years. LR developed in 60 (16.6%) patients.Regional recurrence occurred in 2 (0.6%) patients and distant metastasis (DM)developed in 19 (5.2%) patients. Patients receiving BCS (p = 0.025) and those notundergoing adjuvant RT (p = 0.041) showed higher LR rates. For malignantsubtypes, local control (LC) rates at 5 years for BCS alone, BCS with adjuvantRT, TM alone, and TM with adjuvant RT were 80.7, 93.3, 92.4, and 100%,respectively (p = 0.033). Multivariate analyses revealed BCS alone,tumor size ≥ 5 cm, and positive margins as independent risk factors for LR.Margin-positive BCS alone showed poorest LC regardless of tumor size (62.5%,p = 0.007). For margin-negative BCS alone, 5-year LC rates for tumors ≥ 5 cmversus those < 5 cm were 71.8% versus 89.5% (p = 0.012). For borderline subtypes,only positive margins (p = 0.044) independently increased the risk of LR. DMdeveloped exclusively in malignant subtypes and a prior LR event increased therisk of DM by sixfold (HR 6.2, 95% CI 1.6-16.1, p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Malignant and borderline phyllodes tumors with positive marginsafter surgery have high LR rates. After treatment by margin-negative BCS alone,patients with large malignant phyllodes tumors ≥ 5 cm also have heightened riskof LR. Thus, such patients should be considered for additional local therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4838-3 PMID: 29808288
