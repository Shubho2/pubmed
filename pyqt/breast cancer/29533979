The highest solubility of wogonin was observed in stearic acid. Hence, wogonin-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles were composed ofstearic acid as the lipid matrix. The physicochemical properties of thewogonin-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles were evaluated by dynamic laserscattering and scanning electron microscopy. The wogonin-loaded solid lipidnanoparticles exhibited sustained and controlled release up to 72 h. In addition,it was observed that the wogonin-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles exhibitedenhanced cytotoxicity and inhibited poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Overall, the results indicate that wogonin-loaded solid lipidnanoparticles could be an efficient delivery system for the treatment of breastcancer.DOI: 10.3390/nano8030159 PMCID: PMC5869650PMID: 29533979
