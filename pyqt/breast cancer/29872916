Heart function monitoring is recommended during the treatment whichhas led to growing use of resources. The aim of this retrospective study was todetermine the frequency and timing of trastuzumab cardiotoxicity and its riskfactors in real-world setting.METHODS: Single institute, retrospective collection of data on HER2+ breastcancer patients (n = 246) was carried out through a pharmacy search for patients who had received trastuzumab in 2006-2014. Clinical and pathological factors,treatment history, EF measurements, cardiac medications, cardiovascular diseasehistory, cardiac symptoms, and survival data were collected from patient records.RESULTS: 32 patients (13%) had EF decline ≥ 10%, eleven (4.5%) had EFdecline ≥ 20% within 1 year after trastuzumab initiation, and trastuzumab wasdiscontinued due to suspected cardiotoxicity in six patients (2.4%). 49 patients (19.9%) experienced symptoms related to cardiotoxicity during therapy, whichaccumulated among those with EF drop. Underlying cardiovascular diseases andmultiple (≥ 2) cardiac medications were related to EF drop (≥ 20%) andtrastuzumab discontinuation. Majority of EF drops (≥ 10%) and trastuzumabdiscontinuations were seen within 6months of trastuzumab initiation and recovery of EF drop to < 10% of the baseline was seen in most cases (62.5%). There was no statistically significant difference in the survival of patients according to EF drop.CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab cardiotoxicity seems to accumulate among patients withunderlying cardiac conditions. EF monitoring could be targeted to risk groupswithout compromising of the cardiac health or survival of HER2-positive breastcancer patients.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2682-9 PMID: 29872916
