Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 2018;162:D2218.[Ultrasound-guided surgery for breast cancer].[Article in Dutch]Volders JH(1), Krekel NMH, Haloua MH, Meijer S, van den Tol MP.Author information: (1)VUmc, Amsterdam.Recent literature shows that perioperative ultrasound guidance of surgery forpalpable and nonpalpable breast carcinoma results in improved surgicaleffectiveness. Ultrasound-guided surgery can easily lead to significantimprovement of the number of radical resections and can decrease the need foradditional surgery or extra radiotherapy. Ultrasound-guided surgery alsocontributes to a reduction in the amount of excessive breast tissue removal,which means the final cosmetic result is better. Ultrasound-guided surgery iscost-effective and easy to learn. Implementation of ultrasound-guided surgery hasincreased in recent years, albeit slowly. Surgeons as well as radiologists shouldbecome more aware of the improvement of primary and secondary outcome measuresthat can be achieved with ultrasound-guided surgery of breast cancer. In additionto radicality, the quantity of excised tissue - tumour tissue and healthy tissue - can be used as a quality indicator, given the impact on cosmetic outcome andquality of life for patients with breast cancer.PMID: 29676707
