Epub 2018 May25.Role of the SOX18 protein in neoplastic processes.Olbromski M(1), Podhorska-Okołów M(1), Dzięgiel P(1)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Histology and Embryology, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-368Wroclaw, Poland.(2)Department of Physiotherapy, University School of Physical Education, 51-617Wroclaw, Poland.There is a high demand for anticancer drugs due to the fact that thechemotherapeutics currently used have numerous side effects, which lowers thepatient's quality of life. However, the latest antibody therapies are extremelyexpensive, hence the requirement to identify novel, equally effective butlow-toxic treatments that have limited side effects. As a result of this, anumber of research centres around the world are attempting to identify novelmolecular markers that could be effective targets for anticancer therapy in thefuture. The SOX18 protein has been suggested to be a significant diagnostic andprognostic marker in various types of cancer. SRY-related HMG-box 18 (SOX18) isan important transcription factor involved in the development of cardiovascularand lymphatic vessels during embryonic development. In addition, it is involvedin the progression of atherosclerosis and wound-healing processes. It has beenobserved that its level is higher in a number of cancer types, includingmelanoma, pancreas, stomach, liver, breast, lung, ovarian and cervical cancer.Furthermore, an association between a high expression of SOX18 in gastric cancer stromal cells and a poor prognosis has been demonstrated. The literatureindicates how complex the pathogenesis of cancer is. Knowing the molecular basis of the pathogenesis of the tumor will allow for the effective use of targetedtherapy, which may result in a higher success in treating patients. It istherefore important to identify novel and effective therapies as well as newproteins that could be potential markers. The SOX18 family, represented by theSOX18 protein, seems to be in this respect a promising element in modernanticancer therapy.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8819 PMCID: PMC6036441PMID: 30008814
