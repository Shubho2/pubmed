Increased bodymass index (BMI) has been associated with the risk of developing breast cancerbut the association based on molecular subtype remains conflicting.Methods: This was an observational study carried out over a period of 2 years.Nonmetastatic breast cancer patients were evaluated for the tumour subtype based on surrogate markers (ER, PR and HER2). The BMI of these patients was correlated with the tumour subtype and size.Results: We studied 476 patients with breast cancer with the median age of 46years (range, 25-86) and 58% were premenopausal. The mean BMI of the cohort was24.1, which was significantly higher in postmenopausal women (24.9 versus 23.6, p< 0.05). Overall, only 10% of patients were obese. The mean BMI in the luminal,HER2 and TNBC subtypes was 24.7, 22.4 and 23.9, respectively (p < 0.01). Also,the mean tumour size in luminal, HER2 and TNBC subtype was 4.02, 3.80 and 4.27cm, respectively (p = 0.158).Conclusion: The average BMI was higher in patients with luminal subtype followed by TNBC and lowest for HER2 at the time of diagnosis. The mean tumour size wasnumerically higher for TNBC and lowest for HER2 subtype although the differencewas not statistically significant. Larger studies may provide clarity ofassociation between the BMI and tumour subtype.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.845 PMCID: PMC6027980PMID: 30034522
