We demonstrate that tacrine-melatonin heterodimer C10, apotent anti-Alzheimer's disease drug, has an antiproliferative effect on MCF-7breast cancer cells. The main cell response to a 24â€‰h-treatment with C10 wasautophagy enhancement accompanied by inhibition of mTOR and AKT pathways.Significantly increased autophagy markers, such as LC3B- and ATG16L-positivevesicles, confirmed autophagy induction by C10. However, analysis of autophagicflux using mCherry-GFP-LC3B construct revealed inhibition of autophagy by C10 at the late-stage. Moreover, electron microscopy and analysis of colocalization ofLC3B and LAMP-1 proteins provided evidence of autophagosome-lysosome fusion with concomitant inhibition of autolysosomal degradation function. After transienttreatment with IC50 dose of C10 followed by cell culture without the drug, 20% ofMCF-7 cells displayed markers of senescence. On the other hand, permanent celltreatment with C10 resulted in massive cell death on the 5th or 6th day.Recently, an approach whereby autophagy is induced by one compound andsimultaneously blocked by the use of another one has been proposed as a novelanticancer strategy. We demonstrate that the same effect may be achieved using a single agent, C10. Our findings offer a new, promising strategy for anticancertreatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0383-6 PMCID: PMC5834631PMID: 29500364
