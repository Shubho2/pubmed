Current investigation has reported major factorscontributing to miRNA biogenesis and has constituted basic principles of miRNAfunction. More recently, it was confirmed that various miRNAs are clearlyimplicated in human malignancies, such as lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, coloncancer and other kinds of carcinoma. In addition, dysregulation in the miRNAmachinery elements such as Dicer, Drosha, DGCR8, Argonaut, and TRBP could beinvolved in the progress of many tumor types. The purpose of the current reviewwas to compile growing information besides how miRNA biogenesis and genesilencing are modified to develop cancer.PMID: 29600985
