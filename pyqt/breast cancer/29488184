Indeed, patients with triple-negative (TN) and HER2+tumors are at higher risk of brain metastases (BM). The objective of thismultinational cohort was to evaluate BM kinetics depending on the BC subtype. We retrospectively analyzed a series of BC patients with BM diagnosed in fourEuropean institutions (1996-2016). The delay between BC and BM diagnoses (BM-freesurvival) according to tumor biology was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. A multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazardsregression model. 649 women were included: 32.0% HER2-/HR+, 24.8% TN, 22.2%HER2+/HR- and 21.0% HER2+/HR+ tumors. Median age at BM diagnosis was 56 (25-85). In univariate analysis, BM-free survival differed depending on tumor biology:HER2-/HR+ 5.3 years (95% CI 4.6-5.9), HER2+/HR+ 4.4 years (95% CI 3.4-5.2),HER2+/HR- 2.6 years (95% CI 2.2-3.1) and TN 2.2 years (95% CI 1.9-2.7)(p < 0.001). It was significantly different between HR+ and HR- tumors (5.0 vs.2.5 years, p < 0.001), and between HER2+ and HER2- tumors (3.2 vs. 3.8 years,p = 0.039). In multivariate analysis, estrogen-receptors (ER) andprogesterone-receptors (PR) negativity, but not HER2 status, were independentlyassociated with BM-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.36 for ER, p = 0.013, 1.31 forPR, p = 0.021, and 1.01 for HER2+ vs. HER2- tumors, p = 0.880). HR- and HER2+tumors are overrepresented in BC patients with BM, supporting a higher risk of BMin these biological subtypes. HR status, but not HER2 status, impacts thekinetics of BM occurrence.DOI: 10.1007/s11060-018-2805-9 PMID: 29488184
