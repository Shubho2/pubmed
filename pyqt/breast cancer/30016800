[Epubahead of print]MiR-410 Acts as a Tumor Suppressor in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast CancerCells by Directly Targeting ERLIN2 via the ERS Pathway.Wu H(1)(2), Li J(1), Guo E(1), Luo S(2), Wang G(2)(3).Author information: (1)Department of Infectious Diseases, Henan Province People's Hospital,Zhengzhou, China.(2)Department of medicine, the Affiliated Tumor Hospital, Zhengzhou University,Zhengzhou, China.(3)Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Endoplasmic reticulum lipid raft-associated 2 (ERLIN2) isreported to be overexpressed in human breast cancer cells and plays an important role in cell proliferation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as post-transcriptionalregulators of gene expression and are involved in the development of multiplemalignancies, including breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of theaberrant ERLIN2 expression in human breast cancer remains poorly understood.METHODS: MiR-410 expression level was analyzed using Real-time PCR, and ERLIN2expression was analyzed using Western blot, Real-time PCR and immunohistochemicalstaining. The effect of miR-410 on ERLIN2 3'UTR intensity was performed using aluciferase assay. Cell proliferation was analyzed using CCK-8 and colonyformation assay, together with an Annexin V-PE/7-AAD kit for cell apoptosisassay. Cell migration and invasion was detected using a Transwell migration andinvasion assay. Methylation specific PCR was used to examine whether miR-410promoter was demethylated.RESULTS: In this study, we validated that ERLIN2 was a direct target of miR-410and miR-410 suppressed ERLIN2 expression at the post-transcriptional level.Importantly, the regulation of ERLIN2 by miR-410 was estrogen receptor (ER)dependent. Functional studies demonstrated that miR-410 inhibited breast cancercell proliferation, migration and invasion, but promoted cell apoptosis. However,inhibition of miR-410 resulted in opposite effects. A xenograft nude mouse model further confirmed that miR-410 suppressed breast tumor growth. In addition,miR-410 modulated the expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT)-related genes. ERLIN2 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation, migrationand invasion, as well as EMT. ERLIN2 overexpression can restore the cellproliferation, migration and invasion that were inhibited by miR-410.Furthermore, our data demonstrated that miR-410 inhibition suppressed theexpression of endoplasmic reticulum-stress (ERS)-related genes, while ERLIN2knockdown abrogated the effects of miR-410 inhibitor. Finally, we showed thatmiR-410 was downregulated in human ER-positive breast cancer tissues, inverselycorrelated with ERLIN2. We further demonstrated the downregulation of miR-410 in breast cancer might be due to the hypermethylation of its promoter.CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that miR-410 suppresses cell growth, migrationand invasion by directly downregulating ERLIN2 in ER positive breast cancer,acting as a tumor suppressor. Our study also suggests that miR-410 may serve as apotential therapeutic target for patients with ER positive breast cancer.Â© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.
