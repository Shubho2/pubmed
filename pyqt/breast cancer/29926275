Texas Cancer Registry Medicaid-linked database was used from 2000 to 2007 forbreast cancer patients aged 20-64. Multivariable logistic regression wasperformed to test the association of race/ethnicity and geographic factors withAET adherence and discontinuation. Of the 1240 women with breast cancer, 60.8% ofnon-Hispanic white vs 46.6% of Black patients were adherent to AET in the firstyear. After adjusting for confounding, Black patients had lower odds of adherencecompared to non-Hispanic white patients (Odds ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.87), but they were not more likely to discontinue therapy during the study period.Patients from the Texas/Mexico border had higher odds of adherence compared toother regions (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.29-4.18). There are substantial racial andgeographic disparities in AET adherence and discontinuation among TexasMedicaid-insured women.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1168-6 PMCID: PMC6038925PMID: 29926275
