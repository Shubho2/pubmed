Metabolic syndrome (MeS), a risk factor for BrCa, is associated to highgrade tumors, increased metastasis and recurrence of this disease. C-terminalbinding protein 1 (CTBP1) is a co-repressor of tumor suppressor genes that isactivated by low NAD+/NADH ratio. Previously, we demonstrated that CTBP1hyperactivation by MeS increased tumor growth in MDA-MB-231-derived xenograftsregulating several genes and miRNAs. In this work, our aim was to elucidate therole of CTBP1 and MeS in BrCa metastasis. We found that CTBP1 protein diminished adhesion while increased migration of triple negative BrCa cells. CTBP1 and MeSmodulated the expression of multiple genes (ITGB4, ITGB6, PRSS2, COL17A1 andFABP4) and miRNAs (miR-378a-3p, miR-146a-5p, let-7e-3p, miR-381-5p, miR-194-5p,miR-494-3p) involved in BrCa progression of MDA-MB-231-derived xenografts.Furthermore, we demonstrated that MeS increased lung micrometastasis and liverneoplastic disease in mice. CTBP1 hyperactivation seems to be critical for MeSeffect on BrCa metastasis since CTBP1 depletion completely impaired the detectionof circulating tumor cells. Our results highlight CTBP1 and MeS impact on BrCaprogression positioning them as key properties to be considered for BrCa patient prognosis and management.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24486 PMCID: PMC5862620PMID: 29568399
