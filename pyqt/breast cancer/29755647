Studies have demonstrated that these immunotherapies should becombined with immunomodulators to improve results. We tested in breast cancer theantitumor effects of a 200 µg autologous tumor cells homogenate combined with0.0625 mg of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and 0.02% formalin. We used a 4T1murine model of BALB/c receiving four weekly injections of either this vaccine orcontrol treatments. The control treatments were either Phosphate Buffer Saline,BCG treated with formalin, or the tumor cells homogenate plus BCG alone. We foundthat mice treated with the vaccine had the lowest tumor growth rate and mitosispercentage. The vaccinated group also showed a marked increase in infiltration ofantitumor cells (natural killer, CD8 + T and CD4+ Th1 cells), as well as adecrease of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associatedmacrophages (TAMs). Additionally, we also observed a possible activation of theimmune memory response as indicated by plasma cell tumor infiltration. Ourresults demonstrate that our proposed breast cancer vaccine induces a potentantitumor effect in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. Its effectiveness, low cost andsimple preparation method, makes it a promising treatment candidate forpersonalized breast cancer immunotherapy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25044 PMCID: PMC5945537PMID: 29755647
