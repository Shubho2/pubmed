(MJprotein) leaves showed high cytotoxic effect on malignant. Chitosan nanoparticleshave frequently been used in protein delivery applications. The aim of this studywas to develop targeted drug delivery system of RIP MJ for breast cancer therapy with chitosan nanoparticles conjugated antiEpCAM antibody. RIP MJ nanoparticleswere prepared using low viscous chitosan and pectin using polyelectrolit complex method, followed by conjugation process with antiEpCAM antibody. Characterizationof this formula was then carried out for its entrapment efficiency, particlessize, zeta potential, morphology using transmission electron microscope (TEM) andcytotoxic assay against T47D and Vero cell line. The optimal concentration of MJ protein; low viscous chitosan; pectin for preparing AntiEpCAM conjugated of RIPMJ nanoparticles was 0.1%; 0.01%;1% (m/v) respectively and showed satisfactoryformula with the average particle size of 376.8±105.2nm, polydispersity index(PI) 0.401, zeta potential 43,71 mV, high entrapment efficiency 98,97±0,12%.Transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging showed a spherical and homogenous structure for nanoparticles. The in vitro cytotoxicity analysis showed that RIPMJ nanoparticle had more cytotoxic effect compared to unformulated RIP againstT47D cell-lines. AntiEpCAM conjugated RIP MJ nanoparticles however, increasedcytotoxic effect of RIPs on Vero cell-lines not for T47D cell-lines.Chitosan-Pectin nanoparticles suitable for delivering protein to target cancercells.PMID: 29618424
