Given the substantial clinical and economic burden of these events in advanced BCa, we conducted the present study to understand theprevalence and identify the risk factors associated with these events amongelderly women presenting with de novo metastatic BCa.METHODS: Using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and Medicaredata, we identified women with incident metastatic BCa diagnosed during2005-2009. Associations between patient demographics and select clinicallyrelevant factors, and SCRT were examined using the Cox proportional hazardsmodel, accounting for death as a competing risk.RESULTS: Of 3,731 Medicare beneficiaries with incident metastatic BCa, 1,808(48.5%) experienced at least one SCRT event during a median follow-up of 13.2months; a majority (69%) experienced a subsequent SCRT event. The proportions of women who had RAD, PF, BS, and SCC were: 32%, 28%, 8%, and 4%. Older women (80+years), or those with more comorbid conditions (CCIâ‰¥2) had a statisticallysignificant lower risk of SCRT (HR 0.78 [CI: 0.67-0.92, p<0.01]; HR 0.77 [CI:0.67-0.89, p<0.01], respectively), primarily due to lower frequency ofradiotherapy (p<0.01). Compared to Caucasians, African Americans had lower riskof SCRT (HR 0.70 [CI: 0.60-0.82, p<0.01]), as well as all SCRT subtypes defining this group except for SCC, which was the same for both race groups.CONCLUSION: This study highlights that certain patient characteristics andclinical factors are associated with the risk of spinal cord compression orpathologic fractures, or need for bone surgery or radiation among women withmetastatic BCa. In future studies, it will also be important to consider theclinical and economic burden based on these components of skeletal complications and radiation therapy use in order to guide and improve the management of womenwith advanced BCa.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193661 PMCID: PMC5832309PMID: 29494653  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
