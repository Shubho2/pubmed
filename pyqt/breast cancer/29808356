Epub 2018May 28.First report of Nitzschia navis-varingica in the Mediterranean Sea and growthstimulatory effects of Nitzschia navis-varingica, Chrysochromulina alifera andHeterocapsa pygmaea on different mammalian cell types.Ayaz F(1), Eker-Develi E(2), Sahin M(3).Author information: (1)Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Graduate Studies in Science, Mersin University, Ciftlikkoy, 33343, Mersin, Turkey. furkanayaz@mersin.edu.tr.(2)Faculty of Education, Mersin University, Yenisehir, 33169, Mersin, Turkey.(3)Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Graduate Studies in Science, Mersin University, Ciftlikkoy, 33343, Mersin, Turkey.A benthic diatom, Nitzschia navis-varingica was found for the first time in theMediterranean Sea. Effects of this diatom species together with the haptophyteChrysochromulina alifera and the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa pygmaea isolated fromthe northeastern Mediterranean Sea coast on prostate, breast cancer andfibroblast cell lines were investigated. Algal extracts did not exert any toxiceffect on these cell lines and it had growth stimulatory impact on the cellswithout discrimination of cell type. Our results suggest potential use of thesealgal extracts in tissue repair and cell growth boosting additive in the diet of humans as well as animals. Moreover, these algal extracts have potential to beused as natural resource in the skin vitalizing creams of cosmetics industry and as wound healing agents in the atopic drugs.DOI: 10.1007/s11033-018-4195-7 PMID: 29808356
