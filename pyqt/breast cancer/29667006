Animal models are essential research tools for investigating themechanisms of diseases and drug actions. To date, there have only been a fewreports in which C57BL/6 mice were used for the study of bone metastases ofbreast cancer. In the current study, we found that intracardiac inoculation ofC57BL/6 mouse-derived parental E0771 breast cancer cells (E0771/Pa) frequentlylead to bone metastases in C57BL/6 mice within 2Â weeks. The bone-metastatic cloneof E0771 (E0771/Bone) established by sequential in vivo selection demonstrated a higher bone-metastatic potential. Although there were no apparent differences in cell morphology or proliferation in monolayer cultures, E0771/Bone showedincreased tumorsphere formation in suspension cultures and tumor formation in theorthotopic mammary fat pad in C57BL/6 mice compared with E0771/Pa. Furthermore,E0771/Bone expressed breast cancer stem-like cell surface markers CD24-/CD44+.These findings suggest that E0771/Bone possesses cancer stem-like properties.Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that mRNA expression of parathyroidhormone-related protein (PTHrP), the most common mediator of osteolytic bonemetastases of breast cancer, was significantly upregulated in E0771/Bone. Thus,cancer stem-like properties and elevated PTHrP expression likely contribute tothe enhanced metastatic potential of E0771/Bone. We believe that this new mousemodel is a useful tool for in vivo studies of bone metastases of breast cancer,especially for those using genetically engineered mice with a C57BL/6 background.DOI: 10.1007/s00774-018-0927-y PMID: 29667006
