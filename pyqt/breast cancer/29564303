The elevatedexpression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) in canceractivates osteoclasts, leading to bone destruction. We previously reported thatα-tocopheryl succinate (αTP-suc) inhibited interleukin-1-induced RANKL expressionin osteoblasts. Here, we examined the effect of αTP-suc on osteolytic bonemetastasis in breast cancer.Methods: To examine the effect of αTP-suc on the metastatic capacity of breastcancer, MDA-MB-231-FL cells were injected into the left cardiac ventricle ofBALB/c nude mice along with intraperitoneal injection of αTP-suc. The mice werethen analyzed by bioluminescence imaging. To investigate the effect of αTP-suc onosteolysis, 4T1 cells were directly injected into the femur of BALB/c mice along with intraperitoneal injection of αTP-suc. Microcomputed tomography analysis and histomorphometric analysis of the femora were performed.Results: αTP-suc inhibited cell migration and cell growth of 4T1 cells. In linewith these results, bone metastasis of MDA-MB-231-FL cells was reduced in miceinjected with αTP-suc. In addition, αTP-suc decreased osteoclastogenesis byinhibiting 4T1-induced RANKL expression in osteoblasts. Consistent with theseresults, 4T1-induced bone destruction was ameliorated by αTP-suc, with in vivoanalysis showing reduced tumor burden and osteoclast numbers.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that αTP-suc may be efficiently utilized toprevent and treat osteolytic bone metastasis of breast cancer with dual effects.DOI: 10.11005/jbm.2018.25.1.23 PMCID: PMC5854820PMID: 29564303
