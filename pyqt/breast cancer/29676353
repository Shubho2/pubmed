The TILassessment was based on the International TIL Working Group recommendations forthe percentage of sTILs and was conducted by four pathologists. The percentage ofiTILs, the number of lymphocytes in hot spot areas (iTILs-HS), and the overallinterobserver agreement for the molecular subtypes were evaluated. The interclasscorrelation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess interobserver agreement amongthe four pathologists.Results: : The ICC score among the observers for the sTIL percentages was 0.74,and the individual ICC values for each molecular subtype were 0.55, 0.88, and0.79 for luminal, HER2-positive, and triple-negative tumors, respectively. Thecompliance value for the iTILs was 0.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) =0.06-0.48], whereas the compliance value for the iTILs-HS was 0.63 (95% CI =0.49-0.71). The compliance values for the iTILs-HS subtypes were 0.72, 0.43, and 0.55 for luminal, HER2-positive, and triple-negative tumors, respectively.Conclusion: The IWTILG recommendations are reproducible and reliable. Theinterobserver agreement of the sTIL percentages was considerably higher for thetriple-negative and HER2-positive cases than the luminal cases, whereas theinterobserver agreement for the assessment of iTILs-HS in tumors was higher forthe luminal subtype.DOI: 10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_131_17 PMID: 29676353
