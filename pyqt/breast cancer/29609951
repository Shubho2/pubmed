Certain genes have been linked to BM; however, none have beenable to predict bone involvement. In this study, we analyzed gene expressionprofiles in advanced breast cancer patients to elucidate genes that can be usedto predict BM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 92 advanced breast cancer patients, including 46patients with BM and 46 patients without BM, were identified for this study.Immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis was performed on 81formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. Data were collected through medicalrecords, and gene expression of 200 selected genes compiled from 6 previousstudies was performed using NanoString nCounter.RESULTS: Genetic expression profiles showed that 22 genes were significantlydifferentially expressed between breast cancer patients with metastasis in boneand other organs (BM+) and non-BM, whereas subjects with only BM showed 17significantly differentially expressed genes. The following genes were associatedwith an increasing incidence of BM in the BM+ group: estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), and melanophilin with an area under the curve(AUC) of 0.804. In the BM group, the following genes were associated with anincreasing incidence of BM: ESR1, progesterone receptor, B-cell lymphoma 2, Rabescort protein, N-acetyltransferase 1, GATA3, annexin A9, and chromosome 9 openreading frame 116. ESR1 and GATA3 showed an increased strength of associationwith an AUC of 0.928.CONCLUSION: A combination of the identified 3 genes in BM+ and 8 genes in BMshowed better prediction than did each individual gene, and this combination can be used as a training set.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
