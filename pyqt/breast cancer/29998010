Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are considered as themain genetic factor in cancers susceptibility. MicroRNAs are critical players in posttranslational gene regulation by binding to their specific recognitionsequences located at 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs. In present study wehave elucidated the role of 9,850 A > G (rs4648298), in development of sporadicCRC in Iranian population.Methods: A case-control study using 88 CRC patients and 88 noncancerouscounterparts was undertaken in order to determine rs4648298 genotypes usingpolymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)method. Also, a meta-analysis was performed based on 9 articles accessed via the MEDLINE, Cochrane review, Google Scholar and Scopus databases.Results: AA genotype was determined to be associated with significant decreasedrisk of CRC in our study population [odds ratio (OR) =0.14; 95% confidenceinterval (CI), 0.05-0.34; P<0.001]. In a meta-analysis on 6 risk estimates forthe AG versus AA genotype, we found a significant inverse association between AG SNPs and risk of gastric adenocarcinoma, CRC, breast cancer and prostate cancer(OR =0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.98; P<0.02).Conclusions: Our results suggest significant correlation between rs4648298polymorphism and CRC risk in Iranian population.DOI: 10.21037/jgo.2017.11.01 PMCID: PMC6006039PMID: 29998010
