Augusta, GA 30912.(3)Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples "Federico II", 80126,Naples, Italy.Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of proteins plays critical role inthe regulation of immune responses controlling JAK/STAT mediated inflammatorycytokines. Among the members, SOCS1 and SOCS3 contain a kinase inhibitory region (KIR) and SOCS3 binds to JAK/STAT/gp130 complex by inhibiting the downstreamsignaling and suppressing inflammatory cytokines. Loss or reduced levels of SOCS3have been linked to cancer-associated inflammation and suppressive immunityleading to enhanced tumour growth and metastasis. In line with these reports, we previously demonstrated that proteolytic degradation of SOCS3 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype drives the expression of inflammatory cytokines.Therefore, we postulated that SOCS3 mimetics might suppress the inflammatorycytokine production in TNBC subtype and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Herewe designed and characterized five linear peptides derived from the N-terminalregion of SOCS3 encompassing regions that interface with the JAK2/gp130 complexby using the Circular Dichroism and Surface Plasmon Resonance spectroscopies. TheKIRESS peptide resulted the sequence containing the most part of the hot-spotsrequired for binding to JAK2 and was further investigated in vivo in mousexenografts of MDA-MB-231-luci tumours as models of human TNBC subtype.Expectedly, this peptide showed a significant inhibition of primary tumour growthand pulmonary metastasis. Our studies suggest that SOCS3 peptidomimetics maypossess a therapeutic potential in aggressive cancers, such as TNBC subtype, withactivated inflammatory cytokines.
