The vitamin D prediction modelmay be a useful surrogate of circulating 25-hydroxvitamin D (25(OH)D)concentrations when this measure was not available. We included a total of 216Korean breast cancer survivors aged 21-79 years who had been diagnosed with stageI to III primary breast cancer and had breast cancer surgery at least 6 monthsbefore enrolment. We used linear and logistic regressions to identifydeterminants for the plasma 25(OH)D concentrations and vitamin D insufficiency(plasma 25(OH)D concentration < 50 nmol/L). We observed that 48.85% of breastcancer survivors had a plasma 25(OH)D concentration less than 50 nmol/L. Weidentified the following determinants for plasma 25(OH)D concentrations: timesince diagnosis (β = -0.005 for 1 month increment), supplementary vitamin Dintake (β = 0.06 for 10 μg/day increment), season of the blood draw (β = 0.35 forsummer; β = 0.32 for fall; β = 0.26 for winter vs. spring), smoking status (β =0.28 for former vs. never), use of any supplement (β = -0.35 for non-use vs.use), and the parity number (β = -0.30 for three or more vs. one) were associatedwith the plasma 25(OH)D concentrations. In addition to the aforementionedvariables, body mass index (BMI) was associated with the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency. We identified the determinants for the plasma 25(OH)Dconcentrations among Korean breast cancer survivors. Future studies are needed toinvestigate the role of vitamin D in the progression of breast cancer amongKorean breast cancer survivors.DOI: 10.3390/nu10030380 PMCID: PMC5872798PMID: 29558405
