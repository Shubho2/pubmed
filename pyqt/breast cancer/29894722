SOX10 expression has been previously documented inbenign breast myoepithelial cells. However there is limited literature on itsexpression in triple negative breast carcinoma(TNBC). The aim was to study theclinical, pathologic and molecular profiles of SOX10+ tumors in TNBC. Tissuemicroarrays of TNBC were evaluated for SOX10 expression in 48cases. SOX10expression was correlated with clinical and pathologic features such as age,grade, and stage. Gene expression was analyzed on RNA extracted from Formalinfixed paraffin embedded(FFPE) specimens with Affymetrix 2.0 HTA. Co-expression ofSOX10 with androgen receptor(AR), WT1, gross cystic disease fluidprotein-15(GCDFP-15), mammaglobin, epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR), CK5/6 and GATA transcription factor 3(GATA3) were also assessed. The mean age was59.38(range,28-90years). Overall, 37.5% cases(18/48) were SOX10+. There was noassociation between SOX10 expression and age, grade or stage of patients.6/10(60%) cases of basal-like 1 (BL1), and 5/8cases of unstable (UNS) molecularsubtype were SOX10+. 1/5 basal-like-2 (BL2), 1/6 Immunomodulatory (IM), 1/4Mesenchymal (M), 1/5 luminal androgen receptor (LAR) and 2/8 Mesenchymal stemcell (MSL) showed lower frequencies of SOX10 expression. There was negativecorrelation between SOX10 and AR+ subtypes(p-value,<0.002). SOX10 was positively correlated with WT1(p-value, 0.05). SOX10 did not show significant correlationwith mammaglobin, GCDFP15, EGFR, CK5/6 and GATA3. SOX10 expression in thebasal-like and unstable molecular subtypes supports the concept that theseneoplasms show myoepithelial differentiation.Copyright Â© 2018.
