We undertook this study to validate these findings.METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we analyzed the prognosticsignificance of TRβ1 protein expression in the breast tumors of 796 women who hadundergone breast surgery in the Henrietta Banting Breast Cancer database. Allwomen were recruited after undergoing primary surgical therapy at Women's CollegeHospital (Toronto, ON, Canada) between January 1987 and December 2000. Detailsregarding patient age at diagnosis, systemic, and local therapies, as well aspathological features of their tumor have been systematically recorded. Clinical outcomes including breast cancer recurrence and death have been updated at least once each year with a median follow-up of 9.6 years (range 0.1-21 years).RESULTS: High TRβ1 expression (> 4 on the Allred score) was associated with alonger breast cancer-specific survival with a HR 0.45 (95% CI 0.33-0.61),p < 0.0001 in a univariable Cox regression model. This was maintained in amultivariable model adjusted for age, tumor size, nodal status, chemotherapy,hormone therapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and ER status with a HR of 0.61 (95% CI0.44-0.85), p = 0.004.CONCLUSIONS: High expression of TRβ1 is associated with longer breastcancer-specific survival independent of other prognostic factors. Given that low TRβ expression is associated with chemotherapy resistance in-vitro, TRβ1 may alsoserve as a predictive biomarker or even a therapeutic target given theavailability of TRβ agonists.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4844-5 PMID: 29915948
