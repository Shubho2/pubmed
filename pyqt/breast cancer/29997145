Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated by use of age, sex, and period specific national incidence rates.RESULTS: 255 786 women contributed 2 257 789 person years' follow-up. Nosignificant increased risk of corpus uteri cancer (164 cancers observed v 146.9cancers expected; SIR 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.30) was foundduring an average of 8.8 years' follow-up. This study found no significantlyincreased risks of breast cancer overall (2578 v 2641.2; SIR 0.98, 0.94 to 1.01) or invasive breast cancer (2272 v 2371.4; SIR 0.96, 0.92 to 1.00). An increasedrisk of in situ breast cancer (291 v 253.5; SIR 1.15, 1.02 to 1.29; absoluteexcess risk (AER) 1.7 cases per 100 000 person years, 95% confidence interval 0.2to 3.2) was detected, associated with an increasing number of treatment cycles(P=0.03). There was an increased risk of ovarian cancer (405 v 291.82; SIR 1.39, 1.26 to 1.53; AER 5.0 cases per 100 000 person years, 3.3 to 6.9), both invasive (264 v 188.1; SIR 1.40, 1.24 to 1.58; AER 3.4 cases per 100 000 person years, 2.0to 4.9) and borderline (141 v 103.7; SIR 1.36, 1.15 to 1.60; AER 1.7 cases per100 000 person years, 0.7 to 2.8). Increased risks of ovarian tumours werelimited to women with endometriosis, low parity, or both. This study found noincreased risk of any ovarian tumour in women treated because of only male factoror unexplained infertility.CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of corpus uteri or invasive breast cancer wasdetected in women who had had assisted reproduction, but increased risks of insitu breast cancer and invasive and borderline ovarian tumours were found in thisstudy. Our results suggest that ovarian tumour risks could be due to patientcharacteristics, rather than assisted reproduction itself, although bothsurveillance bias and the effect of treatment are also possibilities. Ongoingmonitoring of this population is essential.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.
