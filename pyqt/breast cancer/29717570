However, whether cytotoxic chemotherapy for systemic cancer could causepituitary apoplexy has not been investigated. Here, we present a case of a41-year-old woman who developed a severe headache with decreased visual acuityafter intravenous cytotoxic chemotherapy to treat metastatic breast cancer.Preoperative neuroimaging revealed pituitary adenoma with necrosis. Operativefindings and pathologic examination concluded extensive necrosis with a smallintratumoral hemorrhage in a pre-existing pituitary adenoma. We reviewed twoadditional previously published cases of pituitary apoplexy after systemicchemotherapy and suggest that cytotoxic chemotherapy may induce pituitaryapoplexy.Copyright Â© 2018 The Korean Brain Tumor Society, The Korean Society forNeuro-Oncology, and The Korean Society for Pediatric Neuro-Oncology.DOI: 10.14791/btrt.2018.6.e7 PMCID: PMC5932299PMID: 29717570
