There have been few studies of de novo solid organ malignancy(NSOM) after pancreas-kidney transplantation (PKT). The aim of this study wasanalyze the prevalence of NSOM and transplant outcomes.METHODS: We studied the development of NSOM after PKT in our center from May 1990to February 2017. We analyzed demographic characteristics, prevalence of cancer, and survival after cancer diagnosis. We excluded nonmelanoma skin cancer andpatients with history of malignancy before transplantation.RESULTS: We included 194 patients who received 206 PKTs (184 simultaneous PKTsand 22 pancreas after kidney transplants) with triple immunosuppressive therapyand basiliximab in more than 95%. The mean age at transplantation was 39 ± 7years and 74% were male patients. Twelve patients developed malignancies (6.1%). Median time from transplant to NSOM was 6.6 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.2-11.7) years. The malignancies were 2 cecal appendix tumors, 2 hematologic tumors, 2breast tumors, 1 melanoma, 1 native kidney tumor, 1 brain tumor, 1 bladder tumor,1 prostate tumor, and 1 leiomyosarcoma. Thirty-five of the 194 patients of thewhole cohort died throughout the follow-up, 4 of whom died after NSOM diagnosis(11.4%). Patient and grafts survivals were lower in recipients with tumorcompared with recipients without tumor, but the difference was not statistically significant: renal graft survival was 80% vs 90% at 10 years (P = .86); andpancreatic graft survival was 45% vs 70% at 10 years (P = .15), respectively. Themean patient survival time from the diagnosis of cancer was 36.6 (IQR 18-54)months. Patient survival after NSOM diagnosis was 90% at 1 year and 50% at 5years.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of NSOM in our PKT recipients is low, despite thescarce series of published data for comparison. Also hematologic tumors rate isvery low, possibly influenced by age and type of induction.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2017.09.064 PMID: 29579884
