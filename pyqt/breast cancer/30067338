[Epub ahead of print]Analysis of MEMO1 Binding Specificity for ErbB2 using Fluorescence Polarizationand Molecular Dynamics Simulations.Newkirk ML, Rubenstein KJ, Kim JY, Labrecque CL, Airas J, Taylor CA, Evans HD,McKoy Q, Parish CA, Pollock JA.ErbB2 signaling pathways are linked to breast cancer formation, growth, andaggression; therefore, understanding the behavior of proteins associated withthese pathways as well as regulatory factors that influence ErbB2 function isessential. MEMO1 is a redox active protein that is shown to associate withphosphorylated ErbB2 and mediate cell motility. We have developed a fluorescence polarization assay to probe the interaction between MEMO1 and an ErbB2-derivedpeptide containing a phosphorylated tyrosine residue. This interaction is shownto be pH dependent and stronger with longer peptides as would be expected forprotein-protein interactions. We have quantitatively mapped the binding interfaceof MEMO1 to the peptide using the fluorescence polarization assay and moleculardynamics simulations. We have confirmed that phosphorylation of the peptide isessential for binding and through mutagenesis have identified residues thatcontribute to favorable interactions. Our results highlight the importance of theprotein-protein interactions of MEMO1 that complement the oxidase activity. Inthe future, these studies will provide a method for screening for selectivemodulators of MEMO1, which will allow for additional biological investigations.DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00582 PMID: 30067338
