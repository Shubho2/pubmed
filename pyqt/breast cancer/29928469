Identifying germline pathogenic genevariants in patients with primary breast and ovarian cancer could significantlyimpact the medical management of patients. The aim of the study was to evaluatethe rate of pathogenic mutations in the 26 breast and ovarian cancersusceptibility genes in patients who meet the criteria for BRCA1/2 testing and tocompare the accuracy of different selection criteria for second-line testing in afounder population.Methods: Fifteen female probands and 1 male proband that met NationalComprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria for BRCA1/2 testing were included inthe study and underwent 26-gene panel testing. Fourteen probands had breastcancer, one proband had ovarian cancer, and one proband had both breast andovarian cancer. In a 26-gene panel, the following breast and/or ovarian cancersusceptibility genes were included: ATM, BARD1, BLM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1,CHEK2, EPCAM, FAM175A, MEN1, MLH1, MRE11A, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, PALB2, PMS2,PTEN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, STK11, TP53, and XRCC2. All patients previouslytested negative for BRCA1 founder mutations.Results: In 44% (7 out of 16) of tested probands, pathogenic mutations wereidentified. Six probands carried pathogenic mutations in BRCA1, and one probandcarried pathogenic mutations in BRCA2. In patients, a variant of uncertainsignificance was found in BRCA2, RAD50, MRE11A and CDH1. The Manchester scoringsystem showed a high accuracy (87.5%), high sensitivity (85.7%) and highspecificity (88.9%) for the prediction of pathogenic non-founder BRCA1/2mutations.Conclusion: A relatively high incidence of pathogenic non-founder BRCA1/2mutations was observed in a founder population. The Manchester scoring systempredicted the probability of non-founder pathogenic mutations with high accuracy.DOI: 10.1186/s13053-018-0094-0 PMCID: PMC5989401PMID: 29928469
