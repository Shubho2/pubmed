However, a retrospective study found that higher circulating VEGF-C levels were associated with better survival inbreast cancer patients. In 2009, we initiated a prospective study to determinethe utility of preoperative serum VEGF-C levels for predicting the risk ofsentinel lymph node involvement in early breast cancer and to assess serum VEGF-Clevels as a prognostic factor for relapse-free and overall survival. We analyzed serum samples from 174 patients with early breast cancer who underwent sentinellymph node biopsies. VEGF-C levels were determined using an ELISA. Serum VEGF-Clevels were normally distributed, with a median value of 6561.5 pg/mL, and didnot correlate with any other clinical or pathological variables. During a median follow-up period of 58 months, the five-year relapse-free survival rate washigher in patients with VEGF-C levels above the median than in patients withlower levels (95.3% vs. 85.9%, p < 0.04). No association was found between VEGF-Clevels and overall survival. Our study demonstrates that the prognosis was betterfor early breast cancer patients with high serum VEGF-C levels.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25577 PMCID: PMC6021352PMID: 29963266
