The aqueousethanolic extract of T. vulgaris evaluated for chemical composition using the gaschromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) analysis. The prepared TVAgNPs weredetermined by means of UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, zeta potential,scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, andenergy-dispersed spectroscopy analysis. The T. vulgaris extract and TVAgNPs were studied for their in vitro anti-oxidant property by 2, 2-diphenyl, 1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Microscopic observations indicated spherical shaped andmonodispersed nanoparticles and the average size of the nanoparticles was about30 nm. Regarding the elemental composition profile of the TVAgNPs, the highestsignal of silver (89.30%) was detected followed by other elements. An absorption peak was registered at 440 nm according to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of theTVAgNPs in solution. A zeta potential of fabricated nanoparticles wasapproximately - 12.6 mV, indicating higher stability of the bio-functionalizedTVAgNPs. The T. vulgaris extract and synthesized TVAgNPs were evaluated for theiranti-cancer activity using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and Annexin V double staining with propidium iodide (PI) flowcytometric analysis toward T47D cells. The cytotoxicity properties of thebio-functionalized T. vulgaris AgNPs revealed that the sensitivity of T47D human breast cancer cells is high compared with T. vulgaris extract. The Annexin V/PIstaining indicated that the fabricated TVAgNPs shows increased apoptosis in T47D cells as compared to untreated cells. Besides, the anti-oxidant activity of theTVAgNPs clarified a higher anti-radical-scavenging activity compared to Thymusvulgaris extract. Our data show that the potential biological activities of thebioactive constituents of T. vulgaris can be enhanced through bio-functionalized T. vulgaris AgNPs due to the bioorganic compounds that exist in the extract.DOI: 10.1007/s13205-018-1199-x PMCID: PMC5847643 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29556431
