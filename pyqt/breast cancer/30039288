[Epub aheadof print]De novo vitamin D supplement use post-diagnosis is associated with breast cancer survival.Madden JM(1), Murphy L(2), Zgaga L(3), Bennett K(2).Author information: (1)Population Health Sciences Division, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland,Dublin, Ireland. jamiemadden@rcsi.ie.(2)Population Health Sciences Division, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland,Dublin, Ireland.(3)Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.PURPOSE: Experimental laboratory data have indicated a protective effect ofvitamin D on breast cancer progression, while epidemiological evidence isgrowing. Using pharmacy claims data, this study investigates the associationbetween vitamin D supplement use initiated after a breast cancer diagnosis andassociated mortality.METHODS: Women aged 50-80 years with a record of invasive breast cancer wereidentified on the National Cancer Registry Ireland database (n = 5417).Initiation of de novo vitamin D post-diagnosis was identified from linkednational prescription data (n = 2581, 49%). Multivariate Cox proportional hazardsmodels were used to estimate adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for breast cancer-specificmortality.RESULTS: There was a 20% reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality in de novovitamin D users (modelled as a time-varying variable) compared to non-users (HR0.80; 95% CI 0.64-0.99, p = 0.048) and the reduction was greater at 49% (HR 0.51;95% CI 0.34-0.74, p < 0.001), if vitamin D was initiated soon after the breastcancer diagnosis (within 6 months).CONCLUSIONS: In this large national breast cancer cohort, de novo vitamin D usepost-diagnosis was found to be associated with a reduction in breastcancer-specific mortality. Vitamin D, therefore, has the potential as a non-toxicand inexpensive agent to improve survival in breast cancer patients. Findingssupport the need for RCTs exploring the effect of vitamin D supplementation onbreast cancer survival.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4896-6 PMID: 30039288
