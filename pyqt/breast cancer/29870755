Electronic address:schwart9@msu.edu.CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is required for murine mammary ductalmorphogenesis and alveologenesis. Progesterone is critical for proliferation and alveologenesis in adult mammary glands, and there is a similar requirement forprogesterone receptor isoform B (PRB) in alveologenesis. We examined C/EBPβregulation of PR expression. All three C/EBPβ isoforms, including typicallyinhibitory LIP, transactivated the PR promoter. LIP, particularly, stronglysynergized with c-Jun to drive PR transcription. Endogenous C/EBPβ and c-Junstimulated a PR promoter-reporter and these two factors showed promoter occupancyon the endogenous PR gene. Additionally, LIP overexpression elevated endogenousPR protein expression. In pregnancy, both PRB and the relative abundance of LIPamong C/EBPβ isoforms increase. Consistent with a role in PRB expression, in vivoC/EBPβ and PR isoform A expression showed mutually exclusive localization inmammary epithelium, while C/EBPβ and PRB largely co-localized. We suggest acritical role for C/EBPβ, particularly LIP, in PRB expression.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.mce.2018.06.001 PMID: 29870755
