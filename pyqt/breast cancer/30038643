The rationale for in vivo dosimetry in interstitial brachytherapy is to assess the accuracy of thedelivered dose in comparison with the dose calculated by the treatment planningsystem (TPS).Material and methods: One single computer tomography (CT) dataset was used forbrachytherapy planning, taken within 24 hours after implantation. In vivointerstitial measurements with micro-MOSFET-detectors (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) were performed in 12 patients with different anatomiclocations of cancers, including thorax-wall, head and neck, breast, and differenttypes of implantations (monoplanar, loops, and multiplanar).Results: Measured values for the thorax-wall tumor patient showed a goodagreement with the calculated data, with average deviation of -2.7% in 8 mmdistance to the closest dwell position of the source. The deviation of themeasured dose value of the head and neck patient was +55.6% in the first fractionand +8.5% in the last fraction. In the ten breast cancer patients, measured dosesdepended on the proximity of the detector to the irradiated volume PTV.Conclusions: The deviations between planned and measured dose values weremarkedly influenced by the proximity of the detector to the PTV because where theedema exerts, the greatest influence on the tube applicator geometry. Thepositioning of the patient during irradiation must correspond to the positioning in the planning CT. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of in vivodosimetry during interstitial brachytherapy as a routine procedure.DOI: 10.5114/jcb.2018.76748 PMCID: PMC6052378PMID: 30038643
