We also compared the prognostic power of the mEPclin with that of the CPS-EG score.Experimental Design: A total of 428 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from GeparTrio and GeparQuattrostudies were evaluated for mRNA expression of eight cancer-related and threereference genes. The mEPclin score was computed using a modified algorithm andpredefined cut-off values were used to classify each patient at low or high risk.Primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS).Results: A higher continuousmEPclin score was significantly associated with increased risk of relapse [HR,2.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.86-2.51; P < 0.001] and death (HR, 2.28;95% CI, 1.90-2.75; P < 0.001). Similarly, patients classified at high risk bydichotomous mEPclin showed significantly poorer DFS and overall survival comparedwith those at low risk. In contrast with CPS-EG, the mEPclin remainedsignificantly prognostic for DFS in multivariate analysis (HR, 2.13; 95% CI,1.73-2.63; P < 0.001). Combining CPS-EG and other clinicopathological variableswith mEPclin yielded a significant improvement of the prognostic power for DFSversus without mEPclin (c-indices: 0.748 vs. 0.660; P < 0.001).Conclusions: ThemEPclin score independently predicted the risk of distance recurrence andprovided additional prognostic information to the CPS-EG score to assess moreaccurately the prognosis after NACT in the luminal non-pCR patient population.Therefore, this approach can be used to select patients for additionalpost-neoadjuvant therapies.
