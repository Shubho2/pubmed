However, the role of AKIP1 in cervical cancer still remains unknown.This study aimed to explore the role of AKIP1 in cervical cancer and toinvestigate the underlying mechanism of AKIP1 in tumor growth. Expression ofAKIP1 in cervical cancer cells was determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting.Cell-Light EdU and colony formation assays were used to determine cellproliferation. CXCL1 and CXCL8 proteins were quantified by ELISA kits. Westernblotting and qRT-PCR were used to examine the alterations in signaling-relatedproteins and mRNA, respectively. Endothelial cell tube formation assay wasperformed to evaluate the effect of AKIP1 on angiogenesis. A BALB/c nude mousexenograft model was used to evaluate the role of AKIP1 in vivo. Cancer cellproliferation was inhibited and tumor growth and angiogenesis restrained inBALB/c nude mice by suppressing AKIP1 expression in cervical cancer cell lines.In addition, overexpression of AKIP1 in cervical cancer cells elevated the levelsof CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL8. These three chemokines were not only involved inendothelial tube formation by binding to the endothelial receptor CXCR2, but alsoin cervical cancer cell proliferation and clone formation, which were induced by overexpression of AKIP1. Furthermore, we found that AKIP1-induced chemokineexpression was decreased by an inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunitβ. These results show that AKIP1 is crucial in cervical cancer angiogenesis andgrowth by elevating the levels of the NF-κB-dependent chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2,and CXCL8.DOI: 10.1007/s11010-018-3335-7 PMID: 29520695
