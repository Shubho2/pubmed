The optimal cut-off values of SII and ALI werecalculated by the Cutoff Finder. The area under the receiver operatingcharacteristics curve (AUC) was calculated to compare the predictive ability ofeach of the scoring systems. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the clinicopathological variables associated with overall survival.Results: The optimal cut-off value of SII and ALI were 471.2 × 109/L and 37.66,respectively. All scores were significantly related to the 5-year cancer-specificsurvival. The ALI consistently had a higher AUC value in comparison with otherinflammation-based prognostic scores. A multivariate analysis showed that GPS andALI were independently associated with overall cancer-specific survival.Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that GPS and ALI appear to be superior to other inflammation-based prognosticscores in patients undergoing potentially curative resection for NSCLC.DOI: 10.14740/wjon1097w PMCID: PMC6031234PMID: 29988766
