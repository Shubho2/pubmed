A total of 5‑10% of breast cancer and 10‑15% of ovarian cancercases are caused by a hereditary breast‑ovarian cancer syndrome, with mutationspredominantly identified in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Recently, the Mexicanfounder mutation BRCA1 ex9‑12del was identified (deletion of exons 9‑12 withrecombination between introns 8‑12). This is the most frequently reportedmutation in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer in Mexico. Current detection methodsinclude end‑point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and MultiplexLigation‑dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). In the present study a cheap,sensitive and fast detection method was developed based on quantitative PCR andtwo TaqMan® probes, one to detect the deletion (recombination region betweenintrons 8 and 12), and the other one a region from exon 11. With this assay,90 samples were able to be analyzed in 2 h using 2.5 ng of DNA/reaction at a costof ~2‑3 USD. This method is capable of detecting positive samples for DNAdeletion and excluding negative ones. Therefore, the method proposed may be auseful high‑throughput diagnostic option that could be useful in futureassociation or prevalence studies that use large populations.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9141 PMCID: PMC6072190PMID: 29901183
