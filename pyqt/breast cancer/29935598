While surgery is a mainstay of treatment,perioperative interventions may influence risk of metastasis during breast tumourresection. Amide local anaesthetics influence cancer cell biology via numerousmechanisms in vitro, but in vivo data is lacking. We aimed to test the hypothesisthat perioperative lidocaine reduces pulmonary metastasis after inhalation andi.v. anaesthesia in the 4T1 murine breast cancer model.METHODS: 4T1 Cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat-pad ofimmunocompetent BALB/c female mice. After 7 days, the resultant tumour wasexcised under either sevoflurane or ketamine/xylazine anaesthesia with or withoutperioperative i.v. lidocaine (1.5 mg kg-1 bolus followed by 25 min infusion 2 mg kg-1 h-1). Fourteen days post-surgery, posthumous lung and liver specimens wereexamined for metastasis. Pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic cytokines wereprofiled in post-mortem serum from a small number of the mice.RESULTS: Primary tumour diameter was similar between groups. Lidocaine reducedlung metastatic colony count vs sevoflurane alone; median (inter-quartile range) 0 (0-2) compared with 22.5 (0-481), P=0.02 and reduced the proportion of animals with pulmonary metastasis (28.5% compared with 52.5%, P=0.04). In mice receiving ketamine-xylazine, lidocaine did not decrease the overall colony count: 60(26-123) compared with 23.5 (0-225), P=0.43, but increased the proportion ofanimals with pulmonary metastasis (100% compared with 50%, P<0.01). Post-mortemserum analysis demonstrated reduced pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokineexpression in animals without metastasis which received lidocaine withsevoflurane.CONCLUSIONS: In this 4T1 murine model of breast cancer, lidocaine decreasedpulmonary metastasis when combined with sevoflurane anaesthesia, perhaps viaanti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects. It had no such effect in micegiven ketamine anaesthesia.Copyright © 2018 British Journal of Anaesthesia. Published by Elsevier Ltd. Allrights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bja.2017.12.043 PMID: 29935598
