ADMs are assumed to be safe to use in an oncologic setting, but data from controlled studies are still needed. Here, weinvestigate the effects of ADMs on the production of interleukin (IL)-6 andIL-12, key regulators of immune suppression and activation.METHODS: Strattice (ST), CollaMend (CM), and Biodesign (BD) biologic meshes andTiLoop, a synthetic mesh (TL), were used in this study. We isolated myeloiddendritic cells (MDCs), untouched plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), naïve Bcells, and CD8+ T cells and co-cultured these cells with either the biologicmeshes or TL. As positive controls, we used CpG ODN 2216 or lipopolysaccharide(LPS). The cytokine concentrations of IL-12p70 and IL-6 were determined after7 days using sandwich ELISA sets.RESULTS: There were highly significant differences between the ADMs and TL interms of their ability to stimulate immunologic responses. IL-6 expression wassignificantly increased in B cells (p = 0.0006131) and T cells (p = 0.00418) whencomparing TL and ADMs. We also identified significant differences in IL-12production by B cells (p = 0.0166) and T cells (p = 0.003636) when comparing TLand ADMs.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the assumed lack of an immunological response to ADMs, inour experimental study, human immune cells reacted with significantly differentcytokine profiles. These findings may have implications for the potentialactivation or suppression of effector cells in cancer patients and could explain some of the post clinical post surgical signs of ADMS like skin rush and seroma.DOI: 10.1007/s00404-018-4710-z PMID: 29417284
