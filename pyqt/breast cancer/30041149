Although YM155 induces tumor regression in varioustumor types in vivo, phase I and II studies demonstrated responding andnon-responding patient populations. We investigated 11C-labeled YM155([11C]YM155) used as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer to assesswhether tumor uptake of [11C]YM155 correlated with its anti-tumor effect, therebyallowing identification of patients who would respond to YM155 treatment.METHODS: (1) Uptake of YM155 was measured in 39 human cancer cell lines in vitro using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). (2)In vivo tumor uptake was assessed in xenografted mice and total body distributionwas evaluated in a cynomolgus monkey using [11C]YM155 with PET/computedtomography (CT) (mice) and PET (monkey) imaging.RESULTS: Intracellular uptake of YM155 in human cancer cell lines correlated wellwith its in vitro efficacy measured by GI50 (Pearson's r = -0.5709). Similarly,in vivo studies using tumor xenografted mice showed that tumors sensitive toYM155 demonstrated robust uptake of [11C]YM155, whereas insensitive tumorsdemonstrated low uptake. In the monkey, the biodistribution of [11C]YM155indicated low accumulation in lung, breast, head, and neck and was onlysignificant in organs involved with drug clearance: i.e. liver, kidneys, andbladder.CONCLUSIONS: Robust uptake of [11C]YM155 by a tumor appears to be a positivepredictive marker for a good response to YM155. The findings suggest thepotential utility of PET/CT imaging with [11C]YM155 for selection of patientswhose tumors are likely to respond to YM155.ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: YM155 efficacy correlated closely with its in vitrointracellular uptake and uptake on [11C]YM155 PET imaging. [11C]YM155 PET maypredict tumor sensitivity to YM155.IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: The concept that tumor response can be accurately predicted prior to chemotherapy should be exploited to improve cancer treatmentoutcomes through judicious patient selection. The small molecule sepantroniumbromide (YM155), a survivin suppressant, has been developed for the treatment of several cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer. The preferentially high in vitro uptake of YM155 by YM155-sensitive cancer cells and the high in vivo uptake of [11C]YM155 in YM155-sensitive tumors demonstrated by PET imaging suggest the potential utility of performing [11C]YM155 PET toallow the identification of patients with YM155-sensitive tumors.Copyright © 2018.
