The utility of RS for rarer histologic subtypesof breast cancer is uncertain.OBJECTIVE: - To determine the distribution of RS among various histologicsubtypes using a population database.DESIGN: - Women between the ages of 18 and 75 with estrogen receptor-positive,HER2-negative breast cancer and known RS results were identified using theSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Recurrence scores werecategorized into risk groups using both traditional and Trial AssigningIndividualized Options for Treatment cutoffs. Multivariable logistic regressionwas used to determine factors associated with high-risk RS.RESULTS: - We identified 45â€‰618 patients with stage I to III, estrogenreceptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who had RS available. Overall,3087 (7%) and 6337 (14%) of cancers were classified as high risk based ontraditional and Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment RS cutoffs, respectively. The proportion of high-risk RS ranged from 1% (tubular, 2 of 225)to 68% (medullary, 13 of 19) and 4% (tubular, 10 of 225) to 79% (medullary, 15 of19) for traditional and Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatmentcutoffs, respectively. Based on multivariable logistic regression (excludingmedullary), subtypes other than invasive ductal carcinoma and papillary carcinomawere significantly associated with lower RS. The strongest predictors of ahigh-risk RS were higher tumor grade and negative progesterone receptor status.CONCLUSIONS: - We identified distinct distributions of RS among differenthistologic subtypes of breast cancer. Excluding medullary carcinoma, histologicsubtypes other than invasive ductal carcinoma and papillary carcinoma all predictlower RS.DOI: 10.5858/arpa.2017-0169-OA PMID: 29528718
