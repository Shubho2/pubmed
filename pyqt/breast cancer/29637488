Systematic optimization using I-optimaldesign yielded self-assembled phospholipidic nano-micelles with a particle sizeof < 60 nm and > 80% of drug release in 15 min. The cytotoxicity and cellularuptake studies performed using MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines demonstratedgreater kill and faster cellular uptake. The ex vivo intestinal permeabilityrevealed higher lymphatic uptake, while in situ perfusion and in vivopharmacokinetic studies indicated nearly 6.6- and 3.0-folds augmentation inpermeability and bioavailability of Mgf. In a nutshell, vitamin E functionalized SPNMS of Mgf improved the biopharmaceutical performance of Mgf in rats forenhanced anticancer potency.DOI: 10.1007/s13346-018-0498-4 PMCID: PMC5937873PMID: 29637488
