Using miR-1271 mimicsand inhibitors, the effects of miR-1271 over-expression and knockdown on theproliferation, invasion and migration of MCF-7 cells were analyzed, respectively.Dual-luciferase activity assay was recruited to examine the potential target geneSPIN1 that was predicted by several databases. Protein level was studied usingWestern blotting.RESULTS: MiR-1271 was significantly lowly expressed in breast cancer tissuesamples and cell lines. Over-expression of miR-1271 in MCF-7 cells significantly decreased the cell proliferation, invasion, and migration abilities whiledown-regulation of miR-1271 in MDA-MB-453 cells increased these abilitiesoppositely. Dual-luciferase and Western blotting were used to confirm SPIN1 as a target gene of miR-1271. Furthermore, up-regulation SPIN1 reserved thesuppressive effect of miR-1271 over-expression on cell growth and progression.CONCLUSIONS: miR-1271 can suppress breast cancer cell proliferation andprogression via SPIN1, which may provide a potential therapeutic target intreatment for breast cancer.PMID: 29771421
