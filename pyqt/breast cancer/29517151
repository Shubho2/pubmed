Information is scarce regarding the characteristics of breastcarcinomas diagnosed after a BBD. Our aim was to point out the differences inclinical and histologic characteristics of breast carcinomas diagnosed in womenwith and without a previous pathologic diagnosis of BBD in the context ofpopulation-based mammography screening. Retrospective cohort study of all womenaged 50-69 years who were screened at least once in a population-based screening program in Spain, between 1994 and 2011 and followed up until December 2012. The mean follow-up was 6.1 years. We analyzed 6645 breast carcinomas, of whom 238 hada previous pathologic diagnosis of BBD. Information on clinical and histologiccharacteristics was collected from pathology reports. Logistic regression wasused to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) ofoccurrence of selected histologic characteristics of breast carcinomas in womenwith and without a previous BBD. Women with a previous BBD had a higherproportion of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) compared with women without a BBD(22.1% and 13.6%, respectively). Among those diagnosed with an invasive breastcarcinoma, women with previous BBD were more likely to be diagnosed withcarcinomas sized >2 cm (OR = 1.46; 95%CI = 1.03-2.08), metastatic positive(OR = 2.66; 95%CI = 1.21-5.86), and with a high Ki-67 proliferation rate(OR = 1.93; 95%CI = 1.24-2.99). No differences were found across histologicsubtypes of BBD. Screening participants with a previous pathologic diagnosis ofBBD had a higher proportion of DCIS. However, invasive carcinomas detected inwomen with a BBD were associated with clinical and histologic characteristicsconferring a worst prognosis.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13003 PMID: 29517151
