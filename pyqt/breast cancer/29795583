We havepreviously demonstrated the potential of MnCl2, a manganese-based CA, in cellularimaging of breast cancer using T1-weighted MRI. In this work, we examined thepotential of another class of manganese-based CAs, manganese porphyrins (MnPs),for sensitive cellular detection of multiple clinical subtypes of breast cancerusing quantitative MRI. Using a clinical 3.0-T MRI scanner, the relaxivities oftwo MnPs, MnTPPS4 and MnTPPS3NH2, and conventional Gd-DTPA (control) weremeasured in ultrapure water and their T1 contrast enhancement patterns werecharacterized in multiple clinical subtypes of breast cancer. The toxicity of thethree CAs was evaluated in vitro. Compared to Gd-DTPA, both MnTPPS3NH2 andMnTPPS4 enabled a more sensitive multi-subtype detection of four breast celllines at doses that posed no cytotoxic effects, with MnTPPS3NH2 producing thegreatest positive enhancement. The superior T1 enhancement capabilities of MnPsover Gd-DTPA are statistically significant and are likely due to their greatercellular uptake and relaxivities. The results demonstrate that multiple clinical subtypes of breast cancer can be imaged on a 3.0-T MRI scanner using MnPs as T1cellular CAs.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196998 PMCID: PMC5993062PMID: 29795583  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
