We sought to determine the survival outcomes of preoperative radiotherapy (PRRT) compared with postoperativeradiotherapy (PORT).Materials and Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)registry was queried for patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer andunderwent cancer-directed surgery. Survival analyses were performed with Coxproportional hazard regression for both overall survival (OS) anddisease-specific survival (DSS), and 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching-adjusted competing risk analyses were conducted for DSS.Results: We first identified 1,111,218 eligible patients in 18 registries from1973 to 2013 and found that, outside of the Utah registry, sequence patternsother than PORT were rarely used. Thus, we next identified eligible patientsregistered in Utah (n = 7,042) from 1988 to 2007. The treatment trends shiftedabruptly in 1988. Compared with the PORT group, the PRRT group showedsignificantly higher risks of overall mortality (absolute difference, 22.4%; P < 0.001), breast cancer-specific mortality (absolute difference, 8.6%; P < 0.001), and cardiovascular disease-specific mortality (absolute difference, 11.5%; P =0.021). Survival differences in treatment sequences were correlated with stage.Conclusions: Substantial shifts in treatment patterns for malignant breast cancerwere identified in Utah. Compared with PORT, PRRT showed significantly worseoutcomes. These results could inform future standardized options for radiationsequence with surgery and further clinical trials.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24313 PMCID: PMC5966264PMID: 29849958
