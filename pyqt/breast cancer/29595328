In this study, we screened 1563compounds and identified Bt354 as a new small-molecule inhibitor of the STAT3signalling pathway. The effect of Bt354 on STAT3 activity was initially screened and Bt354 significantly inhibited STAT3 activity in a dual luciferase assay.Bt354 inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependentmanner. The phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705 was suppressed without affecting thephosphorylation of STAT3 at S727 in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, Bt354inhibited the nuclear translocation of STAT3 and consequently induced cell growthinhibition, apoptosis and cell cycle G2/M arrest in triple negative breast cancercells. In vivo, Bt354 also inhibited tumour growth in MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231xenograft mice without affecting body weight. Computational modelling showed thatBt354 could bind to the SH2 domain of STAT3. These findings suggest that Bt354may be a potent anticancer agent for STAT3-activated triple negative breastcancer cells.DOI: 10.1080/1061186X.2018.1452244 PMID: 29595328
