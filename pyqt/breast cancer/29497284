This study aimed toexplore factors that influence adherence and nonadherence to AET following breastcancer to inform the development of supportive interventions.Methods: Interviews were conducted with 32 women who had been prescribed AET, 2-4years following their diagnosis of breast cancer. Both adherers (n=19) andnonadherers (n=13) were recruited. The analysis was conducted using the Frameworkapproach.Results: Factors associated with adherence were as follows: managing side effectsincluding information and advice on side effects and taking control of sideeffects, supportive relationships, and personal influences. Factors associatedwith nonadherence were as follows: burden of side effects, feeling unsupported,concerns about long-term AET use, regaining normality, including valuing thequality of life over length of life, and risk perception.Conclusion: Provision of timely information to prepare women for the potentialside effects of AET and education on medication management strategies are needed,including provision of timely and accurate information on the efficacy of AET in reducing breast cancer recurrence and on potential side effects and ways tomanage these should they arise. Trust in the doctor-patient relationship andclear patient pathways for bothersome side effects and concerns with AET areimportant. Training and education on AET for GPs should be considered alongsidenovel care pathways such as primary care nurse cancer care review and communitypharmacist follow-up.DOI: 10.2147/PPA.S145784 PMCID: PMC5819578PMID: 29497284
