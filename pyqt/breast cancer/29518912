Although the existence of CSCs was initially described in human leukaemia, less evidence exists for CSCs insolid tumours. Recently, a CD133+ cell subpopulation was isolated from humanbrain tumoursexhibiting stem cell properties in vitro as well as the capacity to initiate tumours in vivo. In the present work, we try to summarize the datashowing that some elements of the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase Class I (PI3K)/Thymoma viral oncogene protein kinase (Akt) pathway, such the activity of PI3KClass I or Akt2, are necessary to maintain the CSC-like phenotype as well assurvival of CSCs (also denoted as tumour-initiating cells (TICs)). Our data andother laboratory data permit a working hypothesis in which each Akt isoform playsan important and specific role in CSC/TIC growth, self-renewal, maintainingsurvival, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, not only inbreast cancer, but also in glioma. We suggest that a more complete understanding is needed of the possible roles of isoforms in human tumours (iso-signallingdetermination). Thus, a comprehensive analysis of how hierarchical signalling is assembled during oncogenesis, how cancer landmarks are interconnected to favourCSC and tumour growth, and how some protein isoforms play a specific role in CSCsto ensure that survival and proliferation must be done in order topropose/generate new therapeutic approaches (alone or in combination withexisting ones) to use against cancer.DOI: 10.3390/biomedicines6010029 PMCID: PMC5874686PMID: 29518912
