The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) using the new method proposed by theInternational TILs Working Group in breast cancer and to standardize the methodof evaluating TILs in CRC.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a database of 160 patients with Stage II or III CRC. The density of TILs was assessed by measuring the area occupied bymononuclear cells over the stromal area on hematoxylin and eosin (H-E)-stainedsections. We set 42% as the cut-off percentage of the area occupied by TILsaccording to the receiver operating characteristic curve, and we classifiedpatients into the high-TILs and the low-TILs groups.RESULTS: The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) inthe high-TILs group were significantly higher than those in the low-TILs group. Amultivariate analysis showed that the density of TILs was independentlyassociated with RFS and OS. Moreover, the density of TILs assessed by an observerwas significantly associated with the density of TILs assessed by the automatedimaging software program.CONCLUSIONS: The new method for evaluating TILs, which was recommended by theInternational TILs Working Group in breast cancer, might be a useful predictivefactor in colorectal cancer patients.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0192744 PMCID: PMC5919485PMID: 29698402  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
