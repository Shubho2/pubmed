Althoughit was found that AIB1 could be phosphorylated by some kinases including PI3K,the function of AIB1 and AKT interaction in breast cancer is not well defined.MCF-7 cells were transfected with pERE-Luc AKT and/or AIB1 plasmids, and then EREluciferase activity in presence or absence of estrogen (E2) were measured.Plasmids containing PTEN and an PI3K inhibitor LY294002 were transfected into or treated cells to identify the interaction of PI3K/AKT and activation of AIB1, andexamine their roles in cell cycle regulation. The AKT phosphorylation activitywas evaluated by kinase assay using H2B as a substrate. The association betweenA1B1 and pS2 promoter was detected by the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)assay. AIB1 and AKT in the same complex were detected by Pull-down assay. IGF-1can increase AIB1 recruitment to PS2 and enhance the ER-dependent transcriptionactivity through the PI3K/AKT pathway. AIB1 associate with AKT to regulate cellcycle. The special relations concerning the AIB1 and AKT may arouse some newviewpoints for potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer.PMID: 29808803
