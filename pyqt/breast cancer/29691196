Here, we studiedolder women with breast cancer treated at a public cancer center in Mexico City, and compared their outcomes with their younger counterparts.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a database of 5488 womentreated for breast cancer at a single institution. We compared clinicalcharacteristics, treatment and survival between women aged <65 and ≥65 years ofage. Survival analyses were performed for each molecular subtype.RESULTS: 851 women (15.5%) were ≥65 years of age, of which 45% presented withStages III-IV disease. Compared with their younger counterparts, older women had lower grade disease, a larger proportion of hormone receptor positive tumors, andwere less likely to receive both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. At 5 years, nodifferences in both disease free and overall survival were found between younger and older women in a multivariate model including stage, grade, tumor subtype andtreatment received.CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with reports from high-income countries, older womenwith breast cancer in developing nations present with more advanced diseaserequiring more aggressive treatment. Strategies aimed at earlier detection,improved access to care, and downstaging among older adults are greatly needed inMexico and in the rest of the developing world.Copyright © 2018.
