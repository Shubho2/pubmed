The role of protease-activatedreceptor 2 (PAR2) in human breast cancer migration/invasion via MMP-2up-regulation remains ill-defined; hence we investigated whetherTF-FVIIa/trypsin-mediated PAR2 activation induces MMP-2 expression in humanbreast cancer.MAIN METHODS: MMP-2 expression and the signaling mechanisms were analyzed bywestern blotting and RT-PCR. MMP-2 activity was measured by gelatin zymography.Cell invasion was analyzed by transwell invasion assay whereas; wound healingassay was performed to understand the cell migratory potential.KEY FINDINGS: Here, we highlight that TF-FVIIa/trypsin-mediated PAR2 activationleads to enhanced MMP-2 expression in human breast cancer cells contributing totumor progression. Knock-down of PAR2 abrogated TF-FVIIa/trypsin-inducedup-regulation of MMP-2. Again, genetic manipulation of AKT or inhibition of NF-ĸBsuggested that PAR2-mediated enhanced MMP-2 expression is dependent on thePI3K-AKT-NF-ĸB pathway. We also reveal that TF, PAR2, and MMP-2 areover-expressed in invasive breast carcinoma tissues as compared to normal.Knock-down of MMP-2 significantly impeded TF-FVIIa/trypsin-induced cell invasion.Further, we report that MMP-2 activates p38 MAPK-MK2-HSP27 signaling axis thatleads to actin polymerization and induces cell migration. Pharmacologicalinhibition of p38 MAPK or MK2 attenuates MMP-2-induced cell migration.SIGNIFICANCE: The study delineates a novel signaling pathway by whichPAR2-induced MMP-2 expression regulates human breast cancer cellmigration/invasion. Understanding these mechanistic details will certainly helpto identify crucial targets for therapeutic interventions in breast cancermetastasis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
