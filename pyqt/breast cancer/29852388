We previously suggested thatGrp94 overexpression is involved in tumor aggressiveness. However, the underlyingmechanisms remain unknown. Since many tumors display high Grp94 levels, weinvestigated the effects of tumor microenvironment on the regulation of thischaperone expression. First, we found out that hypoxia did not change Grp94expression in the human tumor cell lines MCF-7 (breast cancer) and HepG2 (livercancer). Second, glucose deprivation significantly increased Grp94 proteinlevels. Subsequently, we focused in the putative role of Grp94 in the acquisitionof an aggressive phenotype by cancer cells. Using a more aggressive cancer cellmodel (MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells), we found out that Grp94 knockdown usingsiRNA decreased the invasive capacity of cancer cells. Moreover, cells withdecreased Grp94 levels displayed an enhanced sensitivity of tumor cells todoxorubicin, a standard drug in the treatment of breast cancer. Taken together,our results suggest that the expression of Grp94 is linked to tumoraggressiveness. Therefore, targeting Grp94 could be an effective way to inhibittumor growth improving chemotherapy outcome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
