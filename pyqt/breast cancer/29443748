All patients underwent USG-FNAC (group A). Patients withproven metastasis also underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (group B).In addition, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed 2 to 5 hours priorto the surgery.The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictivevalue (PPV) of axillary ultrasound were 75.0%, 75.0%, 75.0%, and 82.6%,respectively, while for USG-FNAC, they were 80.8%, 100.0%, 88.7%, and 100.0%,respectively. Significant differences were found in specificity, accuracy, andPPV between the 2 procedures (P < .05).The results of this study demonstratedthat USG-FNAC was effective for selecting patients with early stage BC using ALNDor SLNB among the Chinese Han female population.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000009855 PMCID: PMC5839868PMID: 29443748  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
