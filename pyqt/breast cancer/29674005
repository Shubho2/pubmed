It can result in complication as erysipelas, warts,Papilloma Cutis Lymphostatica (PCL), or angiosarcomas. Moreover, in womenaffected by breast cancer an accurate differential diagnosis among theseconditions or complication related to radiation dermatitis or cutaneousmetastasis is essential.PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report the case of a 60-year-old postmenopausalCaucasian woman affected by secondary lymphedema following complete mastectomyfor breast cancer. The patient after surgery was treated with radiotherapy,chemotherapy and hormone therapy, developing a lympedema of left arm after fewmonths. These lesions had clinical typical features of PCL, but histopathologicalanalysis revealed dermo-hypodermic metastasis of breast carcinoma.DISCUSSION: The presence of skin lesions in secondary lymphedema afteroncological lymphadenectomy requires an accurate differential diagnosis. In fact,these lesions can emulate degenerative or infective skin diseases; anyway, inpatients affected by secondary lymphedema other less common conditions - as PLC, nodular-type lichen myxedematosus or Gottron's carcinoid papillomatosis - should be taken into account.CONCLUSION: Our case reports the possibility that metastases of breast cancermight also mimic these conditions.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).
