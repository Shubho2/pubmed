Yet alarge proportion of CPMs are believed to be medically unnecessary. Thus, there isa pressing need to educate patients effectively on their CBC risk. We had earlierdeveloped a CBC risk prediction model called CBCRisk based on eight personal riskfactors.METHODS: In this study, we validate CBCRisk on independent clinical data from theJohns Hopkins University (JH) and MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA). Women whosefirst breast cancer diagnosis was either invasive and/or ductal carcinoma in situand whose age at first diagnosis was between 18 and 88 years were included in thecohorts because CBCRisk was developed specifically for these women. A woman whodevelops CBC is called a case whereas a woman who does not is called a control.The cohort sizes are 6035 (with 117 CBC cases) for JH and 5185 (with 111 CBCcases) for MDA. We computed the relevant calibration and validation measures for 3- and 5-year risk predictions.RESULTS: We found that the model performs reasonably well for both cohorts. Inparticular, area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the twocohorts range from 0.61 to 0.65.CONCLUSIONS: With this independent validation, CBCRisk can be used confidently inclinical settings for counseling BC patients by providing their individualizedCBC risk. In turn, this may potentially help alleviate the rate of medicallyunnecessary CPMs.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4763-5 PMID: 29574637
