We have recently shown that Pax-5 regulates NF-κB activity which lead to the modulation of breast cancer phenotypic features (EMT-MET). NF-κB is known as a central mediator in inflammation, stress response as well as being agatekeeper of pro-tumorigenic activity. However, little is known as to how Pax-5 affects this modulation. We thus turned our attention to microRNAs as potentialregulatory effectors. In this study, we set out to elucidate the regulatorynetwork between differential Pax-5 expression and NF-κB activity which dictatebreast cancer malignancy. Through next-generation sequencing (NGS) of breastcancer cells conditionally expressing Pax-5, we profile significantly upregulatedmicroRNAs; including microRNA-155, a known regulator of pathological processesand suppressor of malignant growth. Through the conditional expression ofmicroRNA-155 in breast cancer models, we identify and validate IKKε (IKBKE) as a downstream target and an essential effector of Pax-5-mediated suppression ofNF-κB signaling. Using rescue experiments, we also confirm that Pax-5 modulatesNF-κB activity via IKKε downregulation. Interestingly, we also show thatmicroRNA-155, in turn, supresses Pax-5 expression, indicative of anauto-regulatory feedback loop. Altogether, we demonstrate that Pax-5 inhibitsNF-κB signalling through the regulation of microRNA-155 and its downstream targetIKKε. The elucidation of this signaling network is relevant as Pax-5 and NF-κBare potent transcriptional regulators of breast cancer aggressivity. In addition,IKKε is relevant oncogene aberrantly expressed in 30% of breast carcinomas.Further insight into the regulatory pathways of breast cancer progression willeventually identify strategic therapeutic and prognostic targets to improvecancer patient outcome.DOI: 10.1007/s10911-018-9404-4 PMID: 30032344
