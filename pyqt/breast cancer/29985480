China. tomsyu@163.com.Hexokinase-II (HK2) is a key enzyme involved in glycolysis, which is required forbreast cancer progression. However, the underlying post-translational mechanisms of HK2 activity are poorly understood. Here, we showed that Proviral Insertion inMurine Lymphomas 2 (PIM2) directly bound to HK2 and phosphorylated HK2 on Thr473.Biochemical analyses demonstrated that phosphorylated HK2 Thr473 promoted itsprotein stability through the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway, and thelevels of PIM2 and pThr473-HK2 proteins were positively correlated with eachother in human breast cancer. Furthermore, phosphorylation of HK2 on Thr473increased HK2 enzyme activity and glycolysis, and enhanced glucosestarvation-induced autophagy. As a result, phosphorylated HK2 Thr473 promotedbreast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, PIM2 kinaseinhibitor SMI-4a could abrogate the effects of phosphorylated HK2 Thr473 onpaclitaxel resistance in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findingsindicated that PIM2 was a novel regulator of HK2, and suggested a new strategy totreat breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0386-x PMID: 29985480
