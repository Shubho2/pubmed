China.Previous studies have revealed that HURP (also known as DLGAP5 or KIAA0008) isoverexpressed in many types of human cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma,squamous cell bladder cancer, and transitional cell carcinoma, indicating thatHURP is a putative oncoprotein that promotes carcinogenesis through variousmolecular mechanisms. However, the role of HURP in the pathogenesis of non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been reported. In the present study, weinvestigated the prognostic value of HURP among NSCLC patients through the GEOdatabase. The online tool of KM‑plotter was used to identify the correlation ofHURP expression and the survival of NSCLC patients. We found the HURP expression at the mRNA level was correlated with the clinicopathologic characteristics andprognosis of NSCLC patients. HURP was highly expressed in aggressive NSCLC cells,and its higher expression was associated with shorter survival. Furthercytological experiments revealed that the silencing of HURP caused cell cyclearrest and inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells. Transwell assay showedthat HURP shRNA inhibited cell migration and invasion in vitro. The bioinformaticanalysis suggests that HURP promotes carcinogenesis in multiple manners. Takentogether, we revealed the prognostic value of HURP in NSCLC patients and HURP maybe a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6280 PMCID: PMC5868404PMID: 29484418
