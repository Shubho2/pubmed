They have the characteristics ofbroad biological activity, high efficiency and low toxicity, with good preventionand cure effects on various types of tumors. Breast cancer is the commonestcancer disease and the main cause of cancer death in women worldwide. In China,the morbidity and mortality are still on the rise. Flavonoids can inhibit theoccurrence and development of breast cancer in various aspects. The mainmechanisms include the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis, the promotion ofapoptosis, the retardation of cell cycle, the suppression of invasion andmigration, the induction of DNA damage, and the inhibition of aromatase andmicrotubule production. Due to its chemical structure similar to estrogen,flavonoids have unique advantages in the prevention and treatment of breastcancer. In this paper, studies on anti-breast cancer of flavonoids in recentyears were reviewed, which could provide reference for further studies.CopyrightÂ© by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.PMID: 29676087
