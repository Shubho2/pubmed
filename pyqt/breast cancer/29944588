Ouraim was to show that endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needleaspiration (EBUS-TBNA) can be used for the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer and demonstrate reliable receptor evaluation that can result in change oftherapy.METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive adult patients undergoingEBUS-TBNA from May 2007 to September 2012 was performed. Data collected forpatients with a history of breast cancer included patient demographics, tumorpathology, receptor analysis, imaging, and bronchoscopy or surgical results.RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with a history of breast cancer aged from 31 to 81years underwent EBUS-TBNA for the evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy ofwhich 16 patients had not been previously treated for their breast cancer withsystemic therapy. Eighty suspicious lymph nodes were biopsied measuring 0.8 to3.1â€‰cm in diameter. Fifty-nine (92%) patients had diagnostic cytology formalignancy or benign lymphoid tissue. Breast malignancy was identified in 33(52%) patients and 23 (70%) of these had sufficient samples for the evaluation ofestrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status.Overall 48% of the patients with receptors analyzed had discordance between theprimary tumor and metastasis.CONCLUSIONS: EBUS-TBNA is a useful tool for evaluating mediastinallymphadenopathy in patients with a history of breast cancer and can provideinformation on the concordance of receptors status between the primary tumor and metastatic sites in the thorax.DOI: 10.1097/LBR.0000000000000476 PMID: 29944588
