However, theproduction of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) can impair its function. The aim ofthis study was to investigate the production of neutralizing antibodies againstRebif® and ReciGen® (two brands of IFN-β-1a) and to evaluate its correlation withExpanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples of 71 RRMS patients (34 in ReciGen®, 37 inRebif® group) were collected. Neutralizing antibody was measured by Myxo-virusresistance protein A (MxA) assay using A549 cell line. The MxA concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit.RESULTS: The median period of treatment with IFN-β-1a was 18 months in ReciGen®and 24 months in Rebif® arms. The percentage of patients with positive titer ofneutralizing antibody (NAb+) had no statistically significant difference between groups (P = 0.6). In both ReciGen® and Rebif® groups, the increase in EDSS score was significantly higher in NAb+ patients compared to NAb- patients (p ≤ 0.05).The duration of using ReciGen® or Rebif® for >24 months was influential in theNAb positivity (OR = 3.78).CONCLUSION: Receiving interferon beta-1a for >24 months is correlated with higherpossibility of NAb production. The type of IFN-β used in the study had nosignificant impact on NAb positivity. In addition, both groups had comparableEDSS score changes, and NAb status of patients was correlated with their EDSSscore.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
