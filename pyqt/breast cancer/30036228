[Epub aheadof print]Other Primary Malignancies Among Women With Adult-Type Ovarian Granulosa CellTumors.Bryk S, Pukkala E, Färkkilä A, Heikinheimo M, Unkila-Kallio L(1), Riska A(1).Author information: (1)Obstetrics and Gynecology, and.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of new primarymalignancies after adult-type granulosa cell tumor (AGCT) and the incidence ofAGCT after breast and uterine cancer using nationwide population-based registrydata.METHODS: We used the Finnish Cancer Registry to identify all patients diagnosedwith AGCT in 1968 to 2013 (n = 986). The number of subsequent primarymalignancies among women with AGCT and the number of AGCTs in women with previousbreast or uterine cancer were compared with the expected number of cases andexpressed as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).RESULTS: There were 122 cases of subsequent cancers diagnosed at least 6 monthsafter the primary diagnosis of AGCT (SIR, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI],0.91-1.3). In particular, the observed number of cancers of the soft tissue (SIR,4.13; 95% CI, 1.33-12.8), thyroid (SIR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.54-7.62), and leukemia(SIR, 2.67; 95% CI, 0.98-5.82) exceeded the number of expected cases. The SIR forbreast cancers after AGCT was 1.26 (95% CI, 0.92-1.73), and the SIR for AGCTafter breast cancer was 1.59 (95% CI, 1.04-2.29). The risk for subsequent AGCTwas more than 2-fold in breast cancer patients younger than 50 years, and over 15years after primary diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk for thyroid and soft tissue cancer aswell as leukemia after AGCT, which may be associated with late effects ofcarcinogenic treatments and possibly shared risk factors. After breast cancer,the risk for AGCT was higher, which may indicate a shared hormonal etiology.DOI: 10.1097/IGC.0000000000001333 PMID: 30036228
