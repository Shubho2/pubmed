This cohort included 29 triple-negative, 45 human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, 36 luminal A, and 221 luminal Blesions. A set of 39 quantitative radiomic features, including morphologic,grayscale statistic, and texture features, were extracted from the segmentedlesion area. Three binary classifications of the subtypes were performed:triple-negative vs non-triple-negative, HER2-enriched vs non-HER2-enriched, andluminal (A + B) vs nonluminal. The Naive Bayes machine learning scheme wasemployed for the classification, and the least absolute shrink age and selection operator method was used to select the most predictive features for theclassifiers. Classification performance was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve and accuracy.RESULTS: The model that used the combination of both the craniocaudal and themediolateral oblique view images achieved the overall best performance than usingeither of the two views alone, yielding an area under receiver operatingcharacteristic curve (or accuracy) of 0.865 (0.796) for triple-negative vsnon-triple-negative, 0.784 (0.748) for HER2-enriched vs non-HER2-enriched, and0.752 (0.788) for luminal vs nonluminal subtypes. Twelve most predictive featureswere selected by the least absolute shrink age and selection operator method and four of them (ie, roundness, concavity, gray mean, and correlation) showed astatistical significance (P <.05) in the subtype classification.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that quantitative radiomic imaging features ofbreast tumor extracted from digital mammograms are associated with breast cancer subtypes. Future larger studies are needed to further evaluate the findings.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists. Published byElsevier Inc.
