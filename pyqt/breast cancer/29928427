China.CXXC5 is a newly identified CXXC-type zinc finger family protein, which isencoded by the CXXC5 gene localised to the 5q31.3 chromosomal region. Previousstudies revealed that CXXC5 is associated with various malignant tumours. The aimof the present study was to investigate the prognosis prediction of CXXC5 indifferent breast cancer subtypes via the Gene Expression Omnibus database andbc-GenExMiner. CXXC5 overexpression was observed as associated with a poorprognosis for oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Basal-like breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer also suggest a poor prognosis, howevertheir CXXC5 expression was low and could not be used as a prognostic factor. The CXXC5 correlated genes and their enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms were obtained.Among those enriched GO terms, GO:0070062 (extracellular exosome) had thegreatest number of associated genes and the associated genes of GO:0000122(negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter) andGO:0008134 (transcription factor binding) contained CXXC5. These results suggest that overexpression of CXXC5 is a strongly poor prognostic factor in ER+ breastcancer. However, the role of CXXC5 in breast cancer requires furtherinvestigation.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8647 PMCID: PMC6006432PMID: 29928427
