Armat St, Philadelphia, PA, USA.Latina women continue to face disproportionate breast cancer risk andwell-documented breast health care barriers in Philadelphia. In response tobreast health needs among Latinas in Philadelphia, a health-focusedcommunity-based organization, in partnership with a network of social and health service providers, began offering community-based navigation in 2005. Later,through funding from a federal agency, the organization launched the Naveguemoscon Salud (NCS) Breast Health Partnership Project from 2010 to 2013. NCS offered breast health awareness and education to a broad audience of Latinas inPhiladelphia and community-based navigation services to all interested inaccessing a clinical breast exam (CBE) and/or mammogram. A 2017 survey revisited breast health needs among the same core population to inform next steps. Here, weexplore how findings and lessons learned from a past program and an assessment ofcurrent needs can inform future community-clinical linkage and community-basednavigation to improve access to breast cancer screening and a continuum of carefor Latinas.DOI: 10.1007/s13187-018-1351-7 PMID: 29574540
