As with many solid tumors, TNBC is known to promote invasiveness and metastasis by secretingextracellular vesicles (EVs) capable of modulating the behaviour of recipientcells. Recent investigations have demonstrated that high expression levels ofglucocorticoid receptor (GR) in TNBC are linked to therapy resistance, higherrecurrence rates and increased mortality. In addition to activatingprotein-coding genes, GR is also involved in the expression of short non-codingRNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs). The molecular mechanisms responsiblefor the oncogenic effects of GR on TNBC have yet to be fully elucidated; however,emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs may play a pivotal role in tumorigenesisand metastasis. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify GR-regulated cellularand vesicular miRNAs that might contribute to the particularly oncogenicphenotype of TNBC with a high GR expression. We analyzed miRNA profiles of three TNBC cell lines using an in vitro model of GR overexpression. Next-generationsequencing revealed minor, cell line-specific changes in cellular miRNAexpression, whereas vesicular miRNAs were not significantly regulated by GR.Additionally, the analysis of predicted miRNA targets failed to establish acausal link between GR-induced miRNA expression and oncogenic signaling. On thewhole, given that GR influences miRNA profiles to only a small degree, othermechanisms are more likely to be responsible for the increased mortality ofpatients with TNBC with a high GR expression.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4336 PMCID: PMC5919721PMID: 29620157
