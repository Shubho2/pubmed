However, whether low dose irradiation induceshepatocarcinogenesis and the underlying mechanism remain poorly defined. In thepresent study, we reported that low dose irradiation facilitated theproliferation of hepatocyte through up-regulating HULC in vitro and in vivo. Low dose irradiation exposure elevated HULC expression level in hepatocyte. Deletion of heightened HULC erased the cells growth accelerated following low doseirradiation exposure. CDKN1, the neighbor gene of HULC, was down-regulated byoverexpression of HULC following low dose irradiation exposure via complementary base pairing, resulting in promoting cell cycle process. Thus, our findingsprovide new insights into the mechanism of low dose irradiation-inducedhepatocarcinogenesis through HULC/CDKN1 signaling, and shed light on thepotential risk of low dose irradiation for the development of hepatocellularcarcinoma in pre-clinical settings.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/mc.22813 PMID: 29573465
