Many of these women resist the common treatments. Therefore, itis important to find new products to increase the efficacy of the treatmentprocess. Legume beans, with their various pharmacological properties, can beregarded as a sensitizer when they are combined with radiation. The present studystrove to survey the radio-sensitivity effect of proteins isolated from mung beanaqueous extract on the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7), humancervical cancer cells (Hela) and the human dermal fibroblast cell line.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mung bean aqueous extract was partially purified byammonium sulfate. At first, various concentrations of the extracts were used toevaluate the inhibitory activity by MTT cell proliferation assay.RESULTS: The results showed that MCF-7 cells and Hela cells were inhibited by an IC50 value of less than 250 and 411 µg/ml, respectively, but it proved to have a proliferation effect on the fibroblast cells. Then, the cells were incubated with250 µg/ml extract and exposed to 2, 4, and 6 Gy of X-ray radiation. Thepercentage of the cell survival was investigated through MTT and the clonogenicassay. Apoptosis was measured using acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining.The results demonstrated that the treated MCF-7 cells and Hela cells hadsignificant radio-sensitivity compared with the results of the control group inradiation dose manner in all MTT, clonogenic, and apoptosis assays. In contrast, the treated fibroblast showed a protective effect against radiation.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that mung bean proteins have the capacity to beregarded as a radio-sensitizer for breast cancer. Our results also indicated thatit could be worth to investigate on mung bean proteins further and they should betested in animal models for being treated in radiotherapy.DOI: 10.1080/09553002.2018.1446226 PMID: 29482484
