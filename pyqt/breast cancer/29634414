It is a common malignancy in China withobvious reginal distribution. NPC is a polygenic disease that is affected bynumerous factors. Protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 12 (PTPN12)regulates multiple tumor proliferation and development, including breast cancerand colon cancer. However, the role of PTPN12 in NPC occurrence and developmenthas not been elucidated.PATIENTS AND METHODS: NPC cell line CNE2 was cultured in vitro and divided intothree groups, including control, empty plasmid, and PTPN12 groups. PTPN12 mRNAand protein expressions were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction andWestern blot. CNE2 cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. Cell migrationwas determined by wound healing assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by caspase 3 activity detection. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression wasassessed by Western blot.RESULTS: PTPN12 plasmid transfection increased PTPN12 mRNA and proteinexpressions, suppressed cell proliferation and migration, reduced EGFR level, andenhanced caspase 3 activity compared with control and empty plasmid groups(p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: PTPN12 regulates NPC proliferation and migration through negativeregulating EGFR. It could be treated as a molecular target for NPC diagnosis and prognosis analysis.DOI: 10.1089/cbr.2017.2254 PMID: 29634414
