A number of genes localize tothe region of linkage disequilibrium encompassing rs2686876, including RIC8A,which plays a central role in the development of neural crest-derived structures,such as the meninges.CONCLUSIONS: This finding advances our understanding of the genetic basis ofmeningioma development and provides additional support for a polygenic model ofmeningioma.DOI: 10.1093/neuonc/noy077 PMID: 29762745
