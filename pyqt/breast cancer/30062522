Therefore, precise control ofcPKC-mediated signal is necessary for cellular homeostasis; however, theirdysregulation leads to the development of several pathophysiological conditionsincluding cancer. In cellular microenvironment, cPKC-mediated signaling isaccompanied by multiple molecular mechanisms including phosphorylation, secondmessenger binding, and scaffold proteins. Functional cPKC interacts with a numberof cellular proteins involved in the regulation of multiple biological functions such as cell growth, survival, migration, and adhesion. Further, the role of cPKCvaries from cell to cell, substrate to substrate and, therefore, it is plausible to assume that the dysregulation of cPKC activity causes cellular transformation.Currently, there is no sufficient literature available to provide betterunderstating to develop an effective therapeutic regimen to reversepathophysiological condition caused by functionally dysregulated cPKC. Therefore,in the present review, we have focused on to provide a better and detailinformation on the various aspects of cPKC such as structure, mode of activation,regulation, and distinct cellular functions useful for the development of aneffective therapeutic regimen against the breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1929-x PMID: 30062522
