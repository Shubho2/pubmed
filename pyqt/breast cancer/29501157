Electronic address: chaoyan@sjtu.edu.cn.A novel dual-target recognition sandwich strategy for selective capture anddetection of MCF-7 breast cancer cells based on core-shell magnetic mesoporoussilica (Fe3O4@nSiO2@mSiO2@apt) nanoparticles was developed. Fe3O4@nSiO2@mSiO2@aptnanoparticles, which were prepared by a layer-by-layer method and were used forthe first time to capture cancer cells, have large surface areas, particularlyaccessible mesochannels, and good biocompatibility, enabling aptamers to becompactly anchored onto the surface of the core-shell magnetic nanoparticles. Amucin 1 protein (MUC1)-targeted Fe3O4@nSiO2@mSiO2@apt nanoparticle was used as anaffinity magnetic isolate material to capture target MCF-7 cells selectively and to reduce interference through affinity interaction between the anti-MUC1 aptamerand the MUC1 protein over-expressed on the surface of the MCF-7 cells. Meanwhile,a folate receptor (FR)-targeted affinity fluorescent probe (FA-BSA-FITC) wasdeveloped by coupling folic acid and FITC to the surface of BSA, enabling highsensitivity, selective fluorescent labeling of FR over-expressed MCF-7 cells. Adual-target recognition sandwich assay was developed based on the MUC1-targetedmagnetic nanoparticles and the FR-targeted fluorescent probes. Under optimumconditions, a quantitative assay of MCF-7 cells was achieved with a dynamic rangeof 102-105 cells/mL (R2 = 0.9991). This assay showed high specificity andsensitivity to the target MCF-7 cells. Finally, the proposed strategy could beextended to detect MCF-7 cells in human plasma and whole blood with a recoveryrange of 86.1-104.0% and a RSD range of 1.2-8.4%, respectively. This indicatesthat the dual-target recognition method developed in this research exhibits good selectivity, anti-interference capability, and reliability even in plasma andwhole blood samples and is more suitable for complex samples than previoustargeted assays. Therefore, the approach proposed here may have great potentialfor early breast cancer diagnosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.talanta.2018.01.067 PMID: 29501157
