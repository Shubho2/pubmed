[Epub ahead of print]Current frontline endocrine treatment options for women with hormonereceptor-positive, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-negativeadvanced-stage breast cancer.Abdel-Razeq H(1).Author information: (1)Department of Internal Medicine, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan;School of Medicine, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan. Electronic address:habdelrazeq@khcc.jo.Despite the recent advances in breast cancer early detection and awareness, asignificant portion of patients present with an advanced-stage disease and morepatients will progress to stage IV despite adequate treatment of their initialearly-stage disease. Hormone receptor (HR)-positive, Human Epidermal GrowthFactor Receptor-2 (HER2)-negative subtype is the commonest among all breastcancer subtypes. The management of the advanced-stage disease of this subtype hasevolved significantly over the past few years. The emergence of estrogen receptordown regulators (fulvestrant), mTOR-inhibitors and the recent introduction ofCDK4/6 inhibitors, like palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib, has resulted in a significant and a historical improvement in treatment outcomes. In this paper, we review many of the recently reported clinical trials that led to the approval of these new drugs in the first-line settings, along with the currentinternational guidelines.Copyright Â© 2018 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.
