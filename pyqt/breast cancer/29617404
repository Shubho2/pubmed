However, the regulation of breast cancer angiogenesis and itsrelevance for clinical resistance to antiangiogenic drugs is still incompletelyunderstood. Recent developments on the contribution of microRNA to tumorangiogenesis and on the oncogenic effects of miR-17-92, a miRNA cluster, point totheir potential role on breast cancer angiogenesis. The aim of this work was toestablish the contribution of miR-20a, a member of miR-17-92 cluster, to tumorangiogenesis in patients with invasive breast carcinoma.METHODS: Tube-formation in vitro assays with conditioned medium from MCF7 andMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines were performed after transfection withmiR-20a and anti-miR20a. For clinical validation of the experimental findings, weperformed a retrospective analysis of a series of consecutive breast cancerpatients (n = 108) treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and with a fullcharacterization of their vessel pattern and expression of angiogenic markers in pre-treatment biopsies. Expression of members of the cluster miR-17-92 and ofangiogenic markers was determined by RT-qPCR after RNA purification from FFPEsamples.RESULTS: In vitro angiogenesis assays with endothelial cells and conditionedmedia from breast cancer cell lines showed that transfection with anti-miR20a in MDA-MB-231 significantly decreased mean mesh size and total mesh area, whiletransfection with miR-20a in MCF7 cells increased mean mesh size. MiR-20aangiogenic effects were abrogated by treatment with aflibercept, a VEGF trap.These results were supported by clinical data showing that mir-20a expression washigher in tumors with no estrogen receptor or with more extensive nodalinvolvement (cN2-3). A higher miR-20a expression was associated with higher mean vessel size (p = 0.015) and with an angiogenic pattern consisting in largervessels, higher VEGFA expression and presence of glomeruloid microvascularproliferations (p<0.001). This association was independent of tumor subtype andVEGFA expression.CONCLUSIONS: Transfection of breast cancer cells with miR-20a induces vascularchanges in endothelial tube-formation assays. Expression of miR-20a in breastinvasive carcinomas is associated with a distinctive angiogenic patternconsisting in large vessels, anomalous glomeruloid microvascular proliferationsand high VEGFA expression. Our results suggest a role for miR-20a in theregulation of breast cancer angiogenesis, and raise the possibility of its use asan angiogenic biomarker.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194638 PMCID: PMC5884522PMID: 29617404  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
