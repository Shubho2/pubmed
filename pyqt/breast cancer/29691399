MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been used topredict therapeutic effects for various cancers, but whether miRNAs can serve as biomarkers for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients remains unclear.Using miRNA microarray, we identify 13 differentially expressed miRNAs in theserum of HER2+ MBC patients with distinct response to trastuzumab, and fourmiRNAs are selected to construct a signature to predict survival using LASSOmodel. Further, our data show that miR-940 is mainly released from the tumorcells and miR-451a, miR-16-5p and miR-17-3p are mainly from the immune cells. Allthese four miRNAs directly target signaling molecules that play crucial roles in regulating trastuzumab resistance. In summary, we develop a serum-based miRNAsignature that potentially predicts the therapeutic benefit of trastuzumab forHER2+ MBC patients and warrants future validation in prospective clinical trials.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03537-w PMCID: PMC5915573PMID: 29691399
