Currently, VIBH protocol compliance is monitored visually. In this work, weestablish whether it is possible to gate the delivery of radiation from an Elektalinac using the Microsoft Kinect version 2 (Kinect v2) depth sensor to measure a patient breathing signal. This would allow contactless monitoring during VMATtreatment, as an alternative to equipment-assisted methods such as activebreathing control (ABC). Breathing traces were acquired from six left breastradiotherapy patients during VIBH. We developed a gating interface to an Elektalinac, using the depth signal from a Kinect v2 to control radiation delivery to aprogrammable motion platform following patient breathing patterns. Radiation doseto a moving phantom with gating was verified using point dose measurements and a Delta4 verification phantom. 60 breathing traces were obtained with anacquisition success rate of 100%. Point dose measurements for gated deliveries toa moving phantom agreed to within 0.5% of ungated delivery to a static phantomusing both a conventional and VMAT treatment plan. Dose measurements with theverification phantom showed that there was a median dose difference of betterthan 0.5% and a mean (3% 3 mm) gamma index of 92.6% for gated deliveries whenusing static phantom data as a reference. It is possible to use a Kinect v2device to monitor voluntary breath hold protocol compliance in a cohort of leftbreast radiotherapy patients. Furthermore, it is possible to use the signal from a Kinect v2 to gate an Elekta linac to deliver radiation only during the peakinhale VIBH phase.© 2018 The Authors.
