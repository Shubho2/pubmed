However, the molecular mechanism underlyingits antitumor activity is not fully elucidated. Herein, we have examined theeffect of CBD on two different human breast cancer cell lines: the ER-positive,well differentiated, T-47D and the triple negative, poor differentiated,MDA-MB-231 cells. In both cell lines, CBD inhibited cell survival and inducedapoptosis in a dose dependent manner as observed by MTT assay, morphologicalchanges, DNA fragmentation and ELISA apoptosis assay. CBD-induced apoptosis wasaccompanied by down-regulation of mTOR, cyclin D1 and up-regulation andlocalization of PPARγ protein expression in the nuclei and cytoplasmic of thetested cells. The results suggest that CBD treatment induces an interplay amongPPARγ, mTOR and cyclin D1 in favor of apoptosis induction in both ER-positive andtriple negative breast cancer cells, proposing CBD as a useful treatment fordifferent breast cancer subtypes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
