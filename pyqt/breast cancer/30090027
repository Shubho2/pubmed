The mean follow-up was 49.29 months,and the mean age was 52 years. The mean percentage of PTV from the mammary regionthat received 100% of the prescribed dose was 97.89% (range 95-100), and the meanPTV percentage of the tumour bed that received 100% of the dose was 98%(95-100).The local control and the overall survival were 100%, and the cosmesiswas good in 82% of the patients. Grade 1 acute toxicity was present in 16patients (47%), and grade 1 chronic toxicity occurred in 6 cases (18%).Conclusion: The results of the present study demonstrate that hypofractionationwith integrated boost using intensity-modulated radiation therapy is anacceptable option that provides excellent local control and low toxicity.DOI: 10.1016/j.rpor.2018.06.006 PMCID: PMC6078106 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 30090027
