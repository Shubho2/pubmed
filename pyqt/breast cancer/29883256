In this review, we discuss in detail thedetrimental effects of LDR in some model organisms and animal models, as well as potential risks to human beings from some routine medical screening procedures.Furthermore, cellular mechanisms by which LDR exerts its negative effects likeendoplasmic reticulum stress, epigenetic changes and microRNAs are also reviewed.A few studies are discussed that have reported some benefits of LDR throughchanges in energy metabolism. Lastly, we focus on breast cancer, one of thepredominant forms of cancer potentially affected by LDR and some of the benefits of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as dietary compounds that offerprotection against radiation effects on cancer cells and cancer progression.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, LDR exerts mainly damaging effects through diverse cell andmolecular mechanisms, with a few beneficial effects reported. In some cancers,surrounding adipose tissue of the breast may contribute to obesity-relatedcancer. Further, preclinical data suggest that anti-inflammatory dietarycompounds such as PUFA and other dietary interventions may protect againstradiation effects on cancer cells and cancer progression.DOI: 10.1080/09553002.2018.1484194 PMID: 29883256
