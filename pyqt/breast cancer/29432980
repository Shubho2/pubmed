Overall andrelapse-free survivals were assessed according to "surgery to chemotherapyinterval" through Kaplan-Meier analysis. Likewise, among patients who receivedadjuvant radiotherapy, relapse-free survival was assessed according to "surgeryto radiotherapy interval" through Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate andMultivariate analysis of factors affecting overall and relapse-free survival was then conducted through Cox regression analysis.RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival according to surgery tochemotherapy interval (<vs. > 6 weeks) was conducted. When stratified by thehormone receptor status, the longer interval was associated with worse overallsurvival in hormone receptor-negative patients (P = 0.006); while it was notassociated with overall survival difference in hormone receptor-positive patients(P = 0.268). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the test of interactionbetween "surgery to chemotherapy interval" and hormone receptor status wassignificant (P = 0.015). Moreover, when the multivariate analysis was restricted to hormone receptor-negative patients, longer surgery to chemotherapy intervalwas associated with worse overall survival among this subset of patients(P = 0.004). On the other hand, in multivariate analysis of factors affectingrelapse-free survival, surgery to radiotherapy interval did not impactrelapse-free survival (P = 0.439).CONCLUSION: Among hormone receptor-negative patients, delaying chemotherapyinitiation beyond 6 weeks (after surgery) is associated with worse patientoutcomes. Moreover, delaying radiotherapy initiation beyond surgery does notcompromise outcomes in patients receiving long course adjuvant chemotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
