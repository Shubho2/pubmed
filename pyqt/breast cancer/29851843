We conducted acomparative study among 10 European countries about health information on breast cancer screening, assessing the first 10 Web sites addressing the general public that appeared following an Internet search.With the help of medical residentsinvolved in the EuroNet MRPH Association, we analyzed the first 30 results of an Internet search in 10 European countries to determine the first 10 sites thatoffered screening mammography. We searched for the following information: source of information, general information on mammography and breast cancer screening,potential harms and risks (false positives, false positives after biopsy, falsenegatives, interval cancer, overdiagnosis, lead-time bias, and radiationexposure), and potential benefits (reduced mortality and increased survival).The United Kingdom provided the most information: 39 of all 70 possible identifiedrisks (56%) were reported on its sites. Five nations presented over 35% of thepossible information (United Kingdom, Spain, France, Ireland, and Italy); theothers were under 30% (Portugal, Poland, Slovenia, Netherlands, and Croatia).Regarding the benefits, sites offering the most complete information were thosein France (95%) and Poland (90%).Our results suggest that, despite consensus inthe scientific community about providing better information to citizens, further efforts are needed to improve information about breast cancer screening. Thatconclusion also applies to countries showing better results. We believe thatthere should be greater coordination in this regard throughout Europe.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010957 PMID: 29851843  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
