Several studies, including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), have found inverse associations of bisphosphonate use with riskof breast and endometrial cancer, but little is known about its association with other common malignancies. The objective of this study was to evaluate theassociation of bisphosphonate use on the incidence of lung cancer in the WHI.Patients and methods: The association between oral bisphosphonate use and lungcancer risk was examined in 151 432 postmenopausal women enrolled into the WHI in1993-1998. At baseline and during follow-up, participants completed an inventory of regularly used medications including bisphosphonates.Results: After a mean follow-up of 13.3 years, 2511 women were diagnosed withincident lung cancer. There was no evidence of a difference in lung cancerincidence between oral bisphosphonate users and never users (adjusted hazardratio = 0.91; 95% confidence intervals, 0.80-1.04; P = 0.16). However, an inverseassociation was observed among those who were never smokers (hazard ratio = 0.57,95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.84; P < 0.01).Conclusion: In this large prospective cohort of postmenopausal women, oralbisphosphonate use was associated with significantly lower lung cancer risk amongnever smokers, suggesting bisphosphonates may have a protective effect againstlung cancer. Additional studies are needed to confirm our findings.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy097 PMCID: PMC6005043PMID: 29617712
