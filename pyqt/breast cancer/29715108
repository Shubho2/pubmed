Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes are associated with enhanced metastasis and unfavorable clinical outcome in breast cancer.Therefore, we examined whether IL-6 induced EMT phenotype characterized in breastcancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCF-7 cells treated with different concentrations (10-50ng/ml) of IL-6 for 24 and 48 h. Western blotting, flow cytometry, and cellmigration assay were used to test whether IL-6 promoted tumor-initiating ability in MCF-7 cells.RESULTS: In this study, we found that the induction of EMT by IL-6 resulted inthe acquisition of mesenchymal traits and the increase of tumor-initiatingability in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, we found that 2-phenylnaphthy-ridin-4-onederivatives were able to repress IL-6 induced EMT phenotype and tumor-initiating ability. Among these deriveratives, LYF-11 possessed the most potentialinhibitory activity. LYF-11 effectively inhibited IL-6-induced EMT phenotype and tumor-initiating ability via the inhibition of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signaltransducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a connection between IL-6 receptor activity andEMT phenotype, and tumor-initiating ability. Moreover, LYF-11 is a potentialcompound for breast cancer therapy by targeting JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12530 PMID: 29715108  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
