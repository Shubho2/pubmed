Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center Chicago, IL, USA.BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown the poor prognosis of metastatic breastcancer including bone metastasis. The early prediction and intervention ofinvasive breast carcinoma with bone metastasis are crucial to the outcomes ofpatients. The purpose of our study is to test the hypothesis that the collagendeposition of primary breast cancer can be used as a quantitative biomarker forthe early prediction of bone metastasis.METHODS: A total of sixty breast cancer patients were included in our study, and the surgical specimens of these patients were divided into three groups: patientswith no metastasis (group 1), lymph node metastasis (group 2), and bonemetastasis (group 3). Masson's trichrome staining and hematoxylin and eosinstaining were applied to all primary breast cancers. Collagen area percentage andtumor cell measurement of each sample were measured by HistoQuest software.RESULTS: Measurement results of collagen area percentage (%) in primary breasttumors were 32.39 ± 13.30, 25.37 ± 11.10, and 22.71 ± 8.91 for groups 1, 2, and3, respectively. The corresponding P values were 0.0779 (group 1 vs. group 2),0.4086 (group 2 vs. group 3), and 0.0102 (group 1 vs. group 3). The correlationbetween collagen area percentage and tumor cell measurement were group 1 (P =0.5927, r = -0.1273), group 2 (P = 0.5711, r = -0.1348), and group 3 (P = 0.0003,r = -0.7253).CONCLUSIONS: The collagen deposition of primary breast cancer can be used as aquantitative biomarker for the early prediction of bone metastasis.PMCID: PMC6038064PMID: 30018725
