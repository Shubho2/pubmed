Theobjective of the current study was to identify potential risk factors for LR and LRR after NCT and BCT.METHODS: Individual patient data sets from 9 studies were pooled. The outcomes ofinterest were the occurrence of LR and/or LRR. A 1-stage meta-analytic approachwas used. Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to identifyfactors that were predictive of LR and LRR, respectively.RESULTS: A total of 9 studies (4125 patients) provided their data sets. The10-year LR rate was 6.5%, whereas the 10-year LRR rate was 10.3%. Four factorswere found to be associated with a higher risk of LR: 1) estrogenreceptor-negative disease; 2) cN + disease; 3) a lack of pathologic completeresponse in axilla (pN0); and 4) pN2 to pN3 disease. The predictive score for LR determined 3 risk groups: a low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk group with10-year LR rates of 4.0%, 7.9%, and 20.4%, respectively. Two additional factorswere found to be associated with an increased risk of LRR: cT3 to cT4 disease anda lack of pathologic complete response in the breast. The predictive score forLRR determined 3 risk groups; a low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk group with 10-year LRR rates of 3.2%, 10.1%, and 24.1%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: BCT after NCT appears to be an oncologically safe procedure for alarge percentage of patients with breast cancer. Two easy-to-use clinical scores were developed that can help clinicians to identify patients at higher risk of LRand LRR after NCT and BCT and individualize the postoperative treatment plan and follow-up.
