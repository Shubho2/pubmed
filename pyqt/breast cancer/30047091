We previously showed that the alkylphospholipidInositol-C2-PAF inhibits the proliferation and migration of immortalizedkeratinocytes and the squamous carcinoma-derived cell line SCC-25. Here, weinvestigated the effect of this compound on growth and motility as well as itsmode of action in mammary carcinoma-derived cell lines.METHODS: Using BrdU incorporation and haptotactic cell migration assays, weassessed the effects of Inositol-C2-PAF on MCF-7 and MBA-MB-231 cellproliferation and migration. The phosphorylation status of signaling moleculeswas investigated by Western blotting as well as indirect immunofluorescenceanalysis and capillary isoelectric focusing.RESULTS: We found that Inositol-C2-PAF inhibited the growth as well as themigration in MCF-7 and MBA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, we found that this compoundinhibited phosphorylation of the protein kinase Akt at serine residue 473, buthad no impact on phosphorylation at threonine 308. Phosphorylation of otherkinases, such as Erk1/2, FAK and Src, which are targeted by Inositol-C2-PAF inother cells, remained unaffected by the compound in the mammary carcinoma-derivedcell lines tested. In MCF-7 cells, we found that IGF-1-induced growth, as well asphosphorylation of AktS473, mTOR and the tumor suppressor pRB, was inhibited inthe presence of Inositol-C2-PAF. Moreover, we found that in these cells IGF-1 hadno impact on migration and did not seem to be linked to full Akt activity.Therefore, MCF-7 cell migration appears to be inhibited by Ino-C2-PAF in anAkt-independent manner.CONCLUSION: The antagonistic effects of Inositol-C2-PAF on cell migration andproliferation are indicative for its potential for breast cancer therapy, aloneor in combination with other cytostatic drugs.DOI: 10.1007/s13402-018-0387-3 PMID: 30047091
