Bonemetastases may cause bone fractures, local pain, hypercalcemia, bone marrowaplasia, and spinal cord compression. Therefore, the management of bonemetastases is important in cancer treatment. Normal bone remodeling is regulated by osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL), receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL),parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), and other cytokines. In the tumormicroenvironment, tumor cells induce a vicious cycle that promotes osteoblasticand osteolytic lesions. Studies support the idea that distant metastases mayoccur due to the immunosuppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells(MDSCs). These cells inhibit T cells and natural killer (NK) cells anddifferentiate into tumor-associating macrophages (TAMs), monocytes, and dendriticcells (DCs). In this review, we summarize studies focusing on the role of MDSCsin bone metastasis and provide a strong foundation for developing anticancerimmune treatments and anticancer therapies, in general.© 2018 The Author(s).
