In 1838, J. Muller coined the term "cystosarcomaphyllodes" based on the leaf-like projections of the tumor extending into thecystic spaces and sarcomatous stromal growth. However, seeing as up to 70% ofphyllodes tumors are benign, "cystosarcoma" was removed, and the tumor is nowrecognized simply as phyllodes tumor. It is mainly seen in females between theages of 35 and 55. Although most phyllodes tumors are benign, malignant cases do uncommonly occur, 22% of which have distant metastasis typically to the lungs andbones. Rarely, this tumor metastasizes to other locations. Herein, we report acase of malignant phyllodes tumor with metastasis to the pancreas. According toour knowledge, only 3 case reports of pancreatic metastasis from malignantphyllodes tumor have been reported in literature thus far. We aim to increaseawareness among physicians of this rare metastasic potential of the uncommonlyencountered malignant phyllodes tumor.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6491675 PMCID: PMC6040289PMID: 30050709
