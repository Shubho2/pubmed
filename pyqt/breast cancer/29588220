Electronic address: katarzyna.augoff@umed.wroc.pl.Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in patients with highly invasivecancers and, as such, is a major problem for medicine. It has been increasinglyrecognized that cancer-related inflammation plays an important role in promoting invasion and the metastatic process in which cell motility and upregulation ofproteolytic enzymes are crucial events. TNFα is a proinflammatory cytokine known to stimulate synthesis of MMP9, a zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidasecontributing to the regulation of ECM remodeling and cell signaling. However, theprecise molecular mechanism of TNFα-induced MMP9 gene expression in cancers isstill not fully understood. This study shows that TNFα-induced cell migration andinvasion involve ERK1/2-dependent up-regulation of CDKN1A/p21 expression inhighly aggressive breast cancer cells and that CDKN1A/p21 plays an importantregulatory role in TNFα-induced MMP9 gene expression, indicating an unknownfunction of CDKN1A/p21 as a regulator of proteolytic activity in cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
