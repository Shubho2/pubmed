RNPC1,an RBP, acts as a tumor suppressor through binding and regulating the expression of target genes in cancer cells. This study disclosed that RNPC1 expression waspositively correlated with breast cancer patients' relapse-free and overallsurvival and that RNPC1 suppressed breast cancer cell metastasis.Mechanistically, RNPC1 promotes competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networkcrosstalk among STARD13, CDH5, HOXD10, and HOXD1 (STARD13-correlated ceRNAnetwork), which we previously confirmed in breast cancer cells throughstabilizing the transcripts and thus facilitating the expression of these fourgenes in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, RNPC1 overexpression restrained thepromotion of STARD13, CDH5, HOXD10, and HOXD1 knockdown on cell metastasis.Notably, RNPC1 expression was positively correlated with CDH5, HOXD1, and HOXD10 expression in breast cancer tissues and attenuated adriamycin resistance. Takentogether, these results identified that RNPC1 could inhibit breast cancer cellmetastasis via promoting a STARD13-correlated ceRNA network.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01123 PMID: 29733656
