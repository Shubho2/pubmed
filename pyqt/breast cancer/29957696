Treatment-related morbidities such as adhesivecapsulitis and lymphedema impact functional ability and quality of life.Postoperative exercises have been recommended for years. However, few studiesexist that describe the postoperative rehabilitation experience of breast cancer survivors.PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine the rehabilitation experiencesof women following breast cancer surgery.METHODOLOGY: The study used a descriptive-correlational design. A conveniencesample of 594 breast cancer survivors completed and returned a mailedquestionnaire.FINDINGS: Results indicated that 61% reported that postoperative exercises wereprescribed. Forty-eight percent reported performing the exercises as instructed. Performing exercises as instructed was significantly associated with increasedfunctional ability (p < .0001).CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors who perform postoperative rehabilitationexercises as instructed may improve functional ability.CLINICAL IMPLICATION: Rehabilitation nurses can have an instrumental role in the postoperative rehabilitation care of this population.DOI: 10.1097/rnj.0000000000000168 PMID: 29957696
