There is debatesurrounding the prognostic value of hot spots for CD8+ TIL enumeration.METHODS: We compared hot spot versus whole-tumor CD8+ TIL enumeration inprognosticating TNBC using immunohistochemistry on whole tissue sections andquantification by digital image analysis (Halo imaging analysis software; Indica Labs, Corrales, NM). A wide range of clinically relevant hot spot sizes wasevaluated.RESULTS: CD8+ TIL enumeration was independently statistically significant for allhot spot sizes and whole-tumor annotations for disease-free survival bymultivariate analysis. A 10× objective (2.2 mm diameter) hot spot was found tocorrelate significantly with overall survival (P = .04), while the remaining hot spots and whole-tumor CD8+ TIL enumeration did not (P > .05). Statisticalsignificance was not demonstrated when comparing between hot spots andwhole-tumor annotations, as the groups had overlapping confidence intervals.CONCLUSION: CD8+ TIL hot spot enumeration is equivalent to whole-tumorenumeration for prognostication in TNBC and may serve as a good alternativemethodology in future studies and clinical practice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
