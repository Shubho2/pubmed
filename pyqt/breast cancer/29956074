[Epub ahead ofprint]Outcomes of early-stage breast cancer patients treated with sequentialanthracyclines-taxanes in relationship to relative dosing intensity: a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.Abdel-Rahman O(1)(2).Author information: (1)Clinical Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University,Cairo, Egypt. omar.abdelrhman@med.asu.edu.eg.(2)Department of Oncology, University of Calgary and Tom Baker Cancer Center,Calgary, AB, Canada. omar.abdelrhman@med.asu.edu.eg.PURPOSE: To assess the impact of relative dosing intensity (RDI) on the outcomes of breast cancer patients referred for adjuvant anthracycline-taxanechemotherapy.METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the outcomes of patients in thecomparator arm of the BCIRG005 study who received adjuvantadriamycin/cyclophosphamide (AC)-docetaxel regimen. Overall survival was assessedaccording to RDI through Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariateanalyses of parameters affecting overall survival were then conducted through Coxregression analysis.RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival according to RDI for theAC-docetaxel regimen (< 90 vs. ≥ 90%) was conducted and it showed that RDI < 90% is associated with worse overall survival (P = 0.006). In univariate Coxregression analysis, the following parameters significantly affected overallsurvival (P < 0.05): age, T stage, lymph node ratio, hormone receptor status, andgrade of the disease and RDI for AC-docetaxel regimen. When these factors wereincluded in multivariate analysis, the following factors were associated withworse overall survival: age less than 40 years (P < 0.0001), greater T stage(P < 0.0001), greater lymph node ratio (P < 0.0001), negative hormone receptorstatus (P = 0.001), high grade (P < 0.0001) and RDI ≤ 90% (P = 0.015). Formalinteraction testing between RDI and hormone receptor status has a non-significantP value (P = 0.794).CONCLUSION: Lower RDI for the whole anthracycline-taxane protocol is associatedwith worse patient survival. Every effort should be exercised to avoidunnecessary dose reductions and/or interruptions among early breast cancerpatients receiving adjuvant anthracycline-taxane chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1915-3 PMID: 29956074
