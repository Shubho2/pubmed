However, the role of LVI compared than pathologic completeresponse (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the association between LVI and survival outcomesand clinicopathological features in patients with breast cancer treated with NAC.We retrospectively analyzed 187 patients with breast cancer treated with NAC and surgery between 2005 and 2013 in our institution. Kaplan-Meier analyses were usedto assess recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Medianfollow-up was 57.9 months. Mastectomy (vs breast conserving surgery [BCS]; hazardratio [HR], 1.791; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.022-3.139; P = .042), ypN1-3stage (vs ypN0 stage; HR, 2.561; 95% CI, 1.247-5.261; P = .010), and LVI (vs noLVI; HR, 2.041; 95% CI, 1.170-3.562; P = .012) were associated with worse RFS.Mastectomy (vs BCS; HR, 2.768; 95% CI, 1.173-6.535; P = .020), LVI (vs no LVI;HR, 3.474; 95% CI, 1.646-7.332, P = .001), and human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 overexpression type (vs luminal A type; HR, 11.360; 95% CI,1.501-85.972; P = .019) were associated with worse OS. Patients with LVI andhormone receptor-negative cancer had the worst RFS (P < .001) and OS (P < .001). LVI more than pCR in surgical breast cancer specimens obtained after NAC was asignificant independent prognostic factor. Patients with hormonalreceptor-negative cancer and LVI had unfavorable survival outcomes. We suggestthat patients with hormone receptor-negative cancer and LVI should receiveshort-term follow-up and appropriate management.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011647 PMID: 30045313  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
