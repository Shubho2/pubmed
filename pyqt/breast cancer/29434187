Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are highly metastatic andassociated with poor prognosis. TNBC cells show a marked dependence onextracellular glutamine for growth. Herein we demonstrate that TNBC cells aremarkedly sensitized to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand(TRAIL)-induced apoptosis upon glutamine deprivation. Upregulation ofpro-apoptotic TRAIL receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2/DR5) and downregulation ofFLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) are observed in glutamine-deprived TNBC cells.Activation of the amino-acid-sensing kinase general control nonderepressible 2(GCN2) upon glutamine deprivation is responsible for TRAIL-R2 upregulationthrough a signaling pathway involving ATF4 and CHOP transcription factors. Incontrast, FLIP downregulation in glutamine-deprived TNBC occurs by aGCN2-independent mechanism. Importantly, silencing FLIP expression by RNAinterference results in a marked sensitization of TNBC cells to TRAIL-inducedapoptosis. In addition, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of transaminasesincreases TRAIL-R2 expression and downregulates FLIP levels, sensitizing TNBCcells to TRAIL. Interestingly, treatment with L-asparaginase markedly sensitizes TNBC cells to TRAIL through its glutaminase activity. Overall, our findingssuggest that targeting the glutamine addiction phenotype of TNBC can be regarded as a potential antitumoral target in combination with agonists of proapoptoticTRAIL receptors.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0263-0 PMCID: PMC5833863PMID: 29434187
