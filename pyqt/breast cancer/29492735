For every breast cancer patient, 3-4 women without breast cancer (n = 4328) were selected matched for age, year, and time since cohort enrollment. Based on CVDrisk factors at cohort enrollment, 10-year risk of CVD was calculated andcategorized: low (< 10%), intermediate (10-20%), high (> 20%). Cox proportionalhazard models assessed the risk of CVD events (hospitalization or mortality) and CVD mortality of women with versus without breast cancer, adjusted for baselineCVD risk.RESULTS: After median follow-up of 5 and 6 years, 92 (8.3%) and 325 (7.5%) CVDevents occurred in women with and without breast cancer, respectively. In the lowCVD risk group, women with breast cancer had 1.44 (95% CI 1.00-2.06) times higherrisk of CVD events than women without breast cancer. In the intermediate and highCVD risk categories, risk of CVD events was similar in women with and withoutbreast cancer. Overall, women with breast cancer had 1.77 (95% CI 1.10-2.86)times higher risk of CVD mortality than women without breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Among women with low CVD risk, women with breast cancer have ahigher risk of CVD event than women without breast cancer. Overall, women withbreast cancer have a higher risk of CVD mortality than women without breastcancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4723-0 PMCID: PMC5993849PMID: 29492735
