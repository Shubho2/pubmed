CHI was defined by dividing (V Rx  - V Dl ) by (V Dm  - V Dh ): V Rx , V Dl , V Dm and V Dh were four points selected from the target cumulative dose volume histogram curve. Theeffectiveness of CHI was validated by assessing the treatment plans fornasopharyngeal cancer (NPC, 12 cases), breast cancer afterbreast-conserving-surgery (BC, 10 cases), and stereotactic radiosurgery afterwhole brain irradiation (SRS, 9 cases). Our results indicate that both CHI and HIof the target can distinguish Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) fromIntensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT, p < 0.05) while the mean differencesin CHI (NPC 1.16, BC 1.19 and SRS 3.3) were larger than those in HI (NPC 0.03, BC0.02 and SRS 0.02). In addition, CHI of the combination volume (the target minus the boost) were statistically higher in VMAT than IMRT in all three kinds ofcancer. In conclusion, CHI was effective in assessing the dose heterogeneityinside a target containing a boost volume.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-28110-9 PMCID: PMC6021440PMID: 29950564
