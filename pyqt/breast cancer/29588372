The therapy predictive and prognostic biomarkers oestrogenreceptor (ER), progesterone receptor, HER2 and Ki67 may act as surrogates to geneexpression profiling of breast cancer. The aims of this study were to investigatethe concordance of consecutive biomarker assessment by immunocytochemistry onpreoperative fine-needle aspiration cytology versus immunohistochemistry (IHC) onthe corresponding resected breast tumours. Further, to investigate theconcordance with molecular subtype and correlation to stage and outcome.METHODS: Two retrospective cohorts comprising 385 breast tumours withclinicopathological data including gene expression-based subtype and up to10-year overall survival data were evaluated.RESULTS: In both cohorts, we identified a substantial variation in Ki67 indexbetween cytology and histology and a switch between low and high proliferationwithin the same tumour in 121/360 cases. ER evaluations were discordant in only1.5% of the tumours. From cohort 2, gene expression data with PAM50 subtype were used to correlate surrogate subtypes. IHC-based surrogate classification couldidentify the correct molecular subtype in 60% and 64% of patients by cytology(n=63) and surgical resections (n=73), respectively. Furthermore, high Ki67 insurgical resections but not in cytology was associated with poor overall survivaland higher probability for axillary lymph node metastasis.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows considerable differences in the prognostic value ofKi67 but not ER in breast cancer depending on the diagnostic method. Furthermore,our findings show that both methods are insufficient in predicting true molecularsubtypes.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
