The dispensed prescriptions datacontain basic demographic information, geography measures of the dispensedprescription, drug information (quantity, strength and presentation), cost of thedrug and the date that the dispensed prescription was submitted to NHS BusinessServices Authority.FINDINGS TO DATE: Findings include a study of end of life prescribing in thecommunity among patients with cancer, an investigation of repeat prescriptions toderive measures of prior morbidity status in patients with cancer and studies of prescription activity surrounding the date of cancer diagnosis.FUTURE PLANS: This English linked resource could be used for cancerepidemiological studies of diagnostic pathways, health outcomes and inequalities;to establish primary care comorbidity indices and for guideline concordancestudies of treatment, particularly hormonal therapy, as a major treatmentmodality for breast and prostate cancer which has been largely delivered in thecommunity setting for a number of years.Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
