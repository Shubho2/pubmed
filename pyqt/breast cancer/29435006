China.Prior studies have demonstrated that phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) serves avital function in cell proliferation and metastasis in breast cancer.However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of PRL-3 in breastcancer remain unknown. PRL-3 expression was analyzed in 24 pairs of breast cancerand normal tissues using the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. The results of the present study identified that the expressionof PLR-3 in breast cancer tissues was increased 4.2-fold, compared with normaltissues. Notably, overexpression of PRL-3 significantly promoted theproliferation of cancer cells and inhibited endogenous p53 expression bydownregulating the expression level of p14 alternate reading frame (p14ARF). Inaddition, decreased expression levels of PRL-3 resulted in decreased breastcancer cell proliferation and increased expression level of p14ARF. These resultssuggested that PRL-3 enhances cell proliferation by downregulating p14ARFexpression, which results in decreased levels ofp53. The results of the presentstudy demonstrated that PRL-3 promotes tumor proliferation by affecting thep14ARF-p53 axis, and that it may serve as a prognostic marker for patients withbreast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7639 PMCID: PMC5778921PMID: 29435006
