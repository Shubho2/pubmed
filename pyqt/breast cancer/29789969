However, increased toxicity was observed. We hypothesizedthat functional age measures could be used to identify patients at risk fortoxicity while receiving letrozole plus bevacizumab for hormone receptor-positiveadvanced breast cancer.METHODS: CALGB 40503 was a phase III trial that enrolled patients with hormonereceptor-positive advanced breast cancer randomized to letrozole with or without bevacizumab. Patients randomized to bevacizumab were approached to complete avalidated assessment tool evaluating physical function, comorbidity, cognition,psychological state, social support, and nutritional status. The relationshipbetween pretreatment assessment measures and the incidence of grade ≥ 3 (NationalCancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0)adverse events was determined.RESULTS: One hundred thirteen (58%) of 195 patients treated with letrozole plusbevacizumab completed the pretreatment assessment questionnaire. One patient was excluded due to missing adverse event data. The median age of patients was 56.Frequently reported grade ≥ 3 adverse events were hypertension (26%), pain (20%),and proteinuria (7%). Two hemorrhagic events (one grade 5) and 1 thrombosis eventoccurred. Age ≥ 65 years (p < 0.01), decreased vision (p = 0.04), and poorerpretreatment physical function measures (p < 0.05) were found on univariateanalysis to be significantly associated with increased incidence of grade ≥ 3adverse events. Upon multivariate analysis, age ≥ 65 years (p = 0.01) anddecreased vision (p = 0.04) remained significant. Univariable and multivariablelogistic regression models demonstrated associations between age, vision, theability to walk up flights of stairs, and grade ≥ 3 adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: Age (≥ 65 years), decreased vision, and impairments in physicalfunction correlated with increased incidence of toxicity in patients receivingfirst-line letrozole plus bevacizumab. When evaluating therapy likely to increasetoxicity, functional assessment measures can identify patients at increased risk for side effects who may benefit from closer monitoring.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4828-5 PMCID: PMC6076849 [Available on 2019-09-01]PMID: 29789969
