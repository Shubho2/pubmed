[Epub ahead of print]IRS2 mutations linked to invasion in pleomorphic invasive lobular carcinoma.Zhu S(1), Ward BM(2), Yu J(1), Matthew-Onabanjo AN(1), Janusis J(1), Hsieh CC(1),Tomaszewicz K(3), Hutchinson L(3), Zhu LJ(1)(4)(5), Kandil D(3), Shaw LM(1).Author information: (1)Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology.(2)Department of Surgery.(3)Department of Pathology.(4)Department of Molecular Medicine, and.(5)Program in Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology, University of MassachusettsMedical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.Pleomorphic invasive lobular carcinoma (PILC) is an aggressive variant ofinvasive lobular breast cancer that is associated with poor clinical outcomes.Limited molecular data are available to explain the mechanistic basis for PILCbehavior. To address this issue, targeted sequencing was performed to identifymolecular alterations that define PILC. This sequencing analysis identified genesthat distinguish PILC from classic ILC and invasive ductal carcinoma by theincidence of their genomic changes. In particular, insulin receptor substrate 2(IRS2) is recurrently mutated in PILC, and pathway analysis reveals a role forthe insulin receptor (IR)/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R)/IRS2signaling pathway in PILC. IRS2 mutations identified in PILC enhance invasion,revealing a role for this signaling adaptor in the aggressive nature of PILC.DOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.97398 PMCID: PMC5931118PMID: 29669935
