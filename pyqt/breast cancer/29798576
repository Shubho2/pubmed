The former has many types, whether its degradation rate can match with the growrate of repair tissue will significantly affect the wound healing and tissueintergradation. TiLOOP, on behalf of the latter, has a good postoperativeperformance due to its nano TiO 2 layer, lightness and flexibility.Non-biological meshes have been gradually used to cover and fix implant in BR.Compared with biological meshes, non-biological meshes are cheaper and have amore positive postoperative performance generally, but definite comparison can't be concluded due to the limited data.Conclusion: As non-biological meshes are applied to BR preliminarily, theireffectiveness are still needed to be observed further.Publisher:对非生物补片在乳房重建中的应用进展作一综述。.查阅近年国内外非生物补片在乳房重建中应用的相关研究，并总结分析。.非生物补片可分为可降解和不可降解两类，前者产品类型多样，其降解速率与组织修复速率是否匹配会显著影响切口愈合和组织再生；后者代表产品为 TiLOOP，具有表面纳米 TiO 2层和轻薄柔软特性优势，将其用于乳房重建术可获得较好疗效。非生物补片目前已逐渐用于临床乳房重建术中，起到包覆和固定假体作用；与生物补片相比，价格优势明显，术后总体效果较好。.非生物补片用于乳房重建术时间较短，其有效性及疗效有待进一步观察。.DOI: 10.7507/1002-1892.201702073 PMID: 29798576  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
