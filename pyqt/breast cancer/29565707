We describe here a heavily-pretreated metastatic triple negative breastcancer patient who failed to respond to conventional treatment. Genomic analyses were performed that discovered several targetable alterations (e.g. FGFR1, CDK6, INSR) and created a clinical challenge - which target to target first? Oursolution to this relatively common scenario was using ex-vivo organ culture(EVOC) system to prioritize treatment directed toward the best molecular target. EVOC enabled the trial of several potent targeted agents (Everolimus, Linsitinib,Palbociclib, AZD4547) and allowed semi-quantitative measurement of tumorresponse. The best response was to FGFR inhibitor, AZD4547. Consequently, themost accessible FGFR inhibiting agents (Pazopanib, then Nintedanib) wereadministered and some response was achieved. This report provides a potentialrationale for utilizing EVOC system to predict tumor response to targeted therapywhen multiple targets are proposed.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2018.1450114 PMCID: PMC6067856 [Available on 2019-04-13]PMID: 29565707
