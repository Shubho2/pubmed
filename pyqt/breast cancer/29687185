Interviews with breast cancer patients revealed several themes regarding structural and sociocultural barriers toinitial diagnosis and treatment. Structural barriers included hightreatment-associated costs for patients and their families, burden oftransportation to central treatment centers, and limited access to appropriatehealth care resources. Sociocultural barriers included perceived attack on one's identity associated with breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, influence of the local community, and ideas of faith, spirituality, and conception of death.Findings from this study can help identify areas for improved access andeducation of patients in order to improve breast cancer diagnostic and treatment efforts and enhance opportunities for early detection.DOI: 10.1007/s13187-018-1365-1 PMID: 29687185
