[Epub ahead of print]Metaplastic Breast Cancer Masquerading as Liposarcoma of the Breast: A CaseReport following Oncoplastic Treatment.Elghobashy M(1), Basu N(2), Warner R(2), Dickson J(2), Shaaban AM(1)(3).Author information: (1)University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.(2)Department of Oncoplastic Surgery, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham,United Kingdom.(3)Department of Cellular Pathology, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham,United Kingdom.Mammary liposarcoma is among the rarest of breast tumours. Here we report thepresentation, macroscopic, microscopic, and immunohistochemical features of anextremely rare case of metaplastic carcinoma with extensive pleomorphicliposarcomatous differentiation. A 47-year-old woman presented with bilateralgrade III breast ptosis and a 3 × 4 cm mass in the lower outer quadrant of theleft breast. Mammography and ultrasound confirmed a well-defined mass. A corebiopsy performed was diagnosed as pleomorphic liposarcoma. Microscopically, this was a well-defined, lobulated tumour comprising solid sheets of large pleomorphicand spindle cells with bizarre forms, vacuolated cytoplasm, and ample mitoses.Atypical lipoblasts were easily identifiable. Due to the strong, though patchy,cytokeratin expression, the diagnosis of metaplastic carcinoma with pleomorphicliposarcomatous differentiation was made. Extensive sampling, careful search for a biphasic pattern, ductal carcinoma in situ, and/or epithelial differentiation, and a panel of broad-spectrum cytokeratins are essential to establish thediagnosis.© 2018 S.
