[Epub aheadof print]Satisfaction with care of hospitalised patients with advanced cancer in theNetherlands.Engel M(1), Brinkman-Stoppelenburg A(1), Nieboer D(1), van der Heide A(1).Author information: (1)Department of Public Health, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, theNetherlands.We aimed to assess the level of satisfaction with hospital care of patients with advanced cancer and its association with quality of life and other patientcharacteristics. Eligible patients were asked to fill out the EORTC INPATSAT-32questionnaire, measuring patient satisfaction, and the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL,measuring quality of life. Factor analysis was performed to identify underlyingpatterns in satisfaction. Multivariable regression analyses were used to assessassociations of quality of life and other patient characteristics withsatisfaction. A total of 105 patients participated in the study. The mean generalsatisfaction score was 72 (SD 21). Factor analysis identified three underlyingdimensions: satisfaction with nurses (explaining 62.1% of the total variance),satisfaction with physicians (7.7%) and satisfaction with hospital services(5.3%). Associations were found between global health and general satisfaction(β = 0.35, p = 0.01), and between emotional functioning and satisfaction withhospital services (β = 0.016, p < 0.01). Further, diagnosis of breast cancer was associated with satisfaction with physicians (β = 1.06, p < 0.01) and dyspnoeawith satisfaction with hospital services (β = 0.007, p = 0.03). Patients withadvanced cancer are reasonably satisfied with hospital care. The INPATSAT-32mainly measures satisfaction with nurses. Satisfaction with care and quality oflife seems to represent distinct outcomes of hospital care in patients withadvanced cancer.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ecc.12874 PMID: 29993149
