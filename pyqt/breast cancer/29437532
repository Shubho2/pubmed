Pertuzumab, one of the anti-ErbB2 mAbs, was approved by FDA in 2012 forthe treatment of metastatic breast cancer. The aim of this study was to producebiosimilar version of pertuzumab in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-S cell line, and compare its ErbB2-binding and biological activities, with commercial drug,Perjeta. To this end, a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-based strategy was used toproduce a CHO-S stable cell pool capable of producing high levels of pertuzumab. A two-phase selection strategy based on increasing concentrations of puromycinand MTX was used for selection of stably transfected cell pools. Finally, threestable CHO-S cell pools were achieved and analyzed for productivity in a simplefed-batch culture system. Results showed that, the pool with Puromycin to thefinal concentration of 50 μg/mL and MTX to 1000 nM in the selection phase 2produced and secreted the highest amount of mAb (442.578 mg/L at 8 days) to theculture medium. Assessment of in vitro ErbB2-binding and biological activities ofproduced pertuzumab revealed its high similarity with Perjeta.DOI: 10.1089/mab.2017.0049 PMID: 29437532
