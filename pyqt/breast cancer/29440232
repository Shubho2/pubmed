Best characterized of the'expanding universe' of ncRNAs are the ~22 nucleotide microRNAs (miRNAs) thatbase-pair to target mRNA's 3' untranslated region within the RNA-inducedsilencing complex (RISC) and block translation and may stimulate mRNA transcript degradation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are classified as >200 nucleotides inlength, but range up to several kb and are heterogeneous in genomic origin andfunction. lncRNAs fold into structures that interact with DNA, RNA and proteinsto regulate chromatin dynamics, protein complex assembly, transcription, telomerebiology and splicing. Some lncRNAs act as sponges for miRNAs and decoys forproteins. Nuclear-encoded lncRNAs can be taken up by mitochondria and lncRNAs aretranscribed from mtDNA. Both miRNAs and lncRNAs are dysregulated in endocrinecancers. This review provides an overview on the current understanding of theregulation and function of selected lncRNAs and miRNAs, and their interaction, inendocrine-related cancers: breast, prostate, endometrial and thyroid.Â© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-17-0548 PMID: 29440232
