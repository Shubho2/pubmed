EndoPredict test is aRNA-based multigene assay that assesses the risk of 10-year relapse in thiscontext. Quality assessment is a mandatory requirement for a laboratory toaddress the analytical quality of these molecular analyses. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the robustness of this prognostic test, its usefulness for thepatient's treatment strategy, at the national level.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study presents a pilot quality assessment (QA) of theEndoPredict test using composite design, including the follow-up of internalcontrol values (qREF) of the 12 genes of the assay for 151 independent tests and one formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast cancer sample. The evaluation of the test was performed by comparing the results of six independent medicallaboratories.RESULTS: All measures were highly reproducible and quantification of the qREFshowed a standard deviation of less than 0.50 and a coefficient of variationalways of <2%. All laboratories found concordant results for the breast cancersamples. The mean EndoPredict (EP) score for the breast cancer sample was4.97±0.24. The mean of EPclin score was 3.07±0.05.CONCLUSION: This first French independent reported QA assessed the robustness andreproducibility of the EndoPredict test. Such a simple composite design couldrepresent an adapted QA for an expensive diagnostic test.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12538 PMID: 29715116  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
