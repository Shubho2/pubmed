Electronic address: swei@uabmc.edu.BACKGROUND: The American Joint Committee on Cancer anatomic stage/prognosticgroup template arguably is the most powerful in predicting breast cancer outcomesbecause it considers the primary tumor, regional lymph node involvement, andpresence of distant metastasis. However, other tumor and host characteristicshave also been proved to be of prognostic value, including histologic grade andestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 status. Thus, the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee onCancer consolidated these factors into clinical prognostic stage groups.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We validated the clinical prognostic stage groups comparedwith the anatomic stage groups in a cohort of 3322 breast cancer patients.RESULTS: Compared with the anatomic stage, application of the clinical prognosticstage assigned 27.7% and 24.7% of cases to higher and lower stage groups,respectively. In 14% and 2.8% of cases, the assignment of clinical prognosticstage varied by 2 and 3 anatomic stages up or down, respectively. The Coxproportional hazard model demonstrated superior discriminatory power for clinicalprognostic stage (overall χ2, 464.5; P < .0001 vs. χ2, 363.9; P < .0001). Apairwise comparison revealed that significant improvement was especially observedfor patients with clinically prognostic stage I and III disease compared withthat of the anatomic stage groups.CONCLUSION: The new clinical prognostic stage provides a more powerful, yetimperfect, tool for predicting breast cancer outcomes. Further refinement of thissystem might be necessary in the pursuit of precision medicine.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.07.013 PMID: 30078612
