Afterwards, quantitative real-time PCR were conducted, followed by theperformance of the comparative CT (2-ΔΔCT) method for relative quantification,whilst their correlation with the clinicopathological features of breastmalignancies were assessed by statistical analysis.RESULTS: Both KLK12sv1/2 and KLK12sv3 showed higher expression in non-cancerousthan in cancerous samples. KLKsv1/2 (P = 0.001) upregulated and KLK12sv3(P < 0.001) downregulated in the malignant compared to the benign tumors andtheir discriminative ability was verified by ROC curve analysis. Moreover,KLK12sv3 was associated with grade (P = 0.012) and hormonal receptor status(P = 0.001). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses showed thatpatients with positive KLK12sv1/2 and KLK12sv3 levels presented a significantlylonger disease-free survival (P = 0.014 and P = 0.013, respectively) and overall survival (P = 0.062 and P = 0.004, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the discriminative value of KLK12sv1/2 andKLK12sv3 between benign and malignant breast tumors as well as their potentialfavorable prognostic significance in breast adenocarcinoma.Copyright © 2018 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.
