We developed patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from residual tumors to identify efficient chemotherapies andpredictive biomarkers in a context of resistance to anthracyclines- andtaxanes-based treatments.Experimental Design: PDX were established from residual tumors of primary breast cancer patients treated in neoadjuvant setting. TNBC PDXwere treated by anthracyclines, taxanes, platins, and capecitabine. Predictivebiomarkers were identified by transcriptomic and immunohistologic analysis.Downregulation of RB1 was performed by siRNA in a cell line established from aPDX.Results: Residual TNBC PDX were characterized by a high tumor take, a shortlatency, and a poor prognosis of the corresponding patients. With the exceptionof BRCA1/2-mutated models, residual PDX were resistant to anthracyclines,taxanes, and platins. Capecitabine, the oral prodrug of 5-FU, was highlyefficient in 60% of PDX, with two models showing complete responses. Priortreatment of a responder PDX with 5-FU increased expression of thymidylatesynthase and decreased efficacy of capecitabine. Transcriptomic and IHC analyses of 32 TNBC PDX, including both residual tumors and treatment-naïve derivedtumors, identified RB1 and TYMP proteins as predictive biomarkers forcapecitabine response. Finally, RB1 knockdown in a cell line established from acapecitabine-responder PDX decreased sensitivity to 5-FU treatment.Conclusions:We identified capecitabine as efficient chemotherapy in TNBC PDX modelsestablished from residual disease and resistant to anthracyclines, taxanes, andplatins. RB1 positivity and high expression of TYMP were significantly associatedwith capecitabine response.
