Expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesteronereceptor (PR), HER/2neu was assessed using immunohistochemical approach.RESULTS: BC in patients with metachronous EC and OC was characterized by adifferent frequency of molecular subtypes with the dominance of luminal A (36%)and B (43%) subtypes. In primary BC, we have established a correlation between ERexpression and regional lymph nodes status (r = -0.50, p &lt; 0.05); negativecorrelation between HER2/neu expression and tumor stage (r = -0.48, p &lt; 0.05);between the molecular subtype of BC and its size (r = -0.33, p &lt;0.05), themolecular subtype of primary BC and metastases in regional lymph nodes (r = 0.27,p &lt;0.05). In the patients with luminal subtype BC metachronous tumorsdeveloped with the highest frequency (OC - 50%, EC - 50%). After treatment ofprimary BC metachronous tumors developed at different period: EC (22.2%) - mostoften in 3-5 years, OC (11.0%) - after 10 years and more.CONCLUSION: Our data evidence on the clinical significance of the individualcharacteristics of the BC, especially its molecular subtype, and the need tocalculate the personalized risk of development of metachronous tumors of thereproductive system in patients with the BC.PMID: 29949531
