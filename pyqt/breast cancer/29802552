Theobjective was to examine the stability and pharmacokinetics of [68Ga]NODAGA andDOTA-peptide conjugate targeting VPAC [combined for vasoactive intestinal peptide(VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP)] receptors ontumor cells.PROCEDURES: A VPAC receptor-specific peptide was chosen as a model peptide andconjugated to NODAGA and DOTA via solid-phase synthesis. The conjugates werecharacterized by HPLC and MALDI-TOF. Following Ga-68 chelation, the radiochemicalpurity of Ga-68 labeled peptide conjugate was determined by radio-HPLC. Thestability was tested against transmetallation using 100 nM Fe3+/Zn2+/Ca2+ ionicsolution and against transchelation using 200 μM DTPA solution. The ex vivo andin vivo stability of the Ga-68 labeled peptide conjugate was tested in mouseplasma and urine. Receptor specificity was determined ex vivo by cell bindingassays using human breast cancer BT474 cells. Positron emission tomography(PET)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging, tissue distribution, and blockingstudies were performed in mice bearing BT474 xenografts.RESULTS: The chemical and radiochemical purity was greater than 95 % and bothconjugates were stable against transchelation and transmetallation. Ex vivostability at 60 min showed that the NODAGA-peptide-bound Ga-68 reduced to42.1 ± 3.7 % (in plasma) and 37.4 ± 2.9 % (in urine), whereas theDOTA-peptide-bound Ga-68 was reduced to 1.2 ± 0.3 % (in plasma) and 4.2 ± 0.4 %(in urine) at 60 min. Similarly, the in vivo stability for [68Ga]NODAGA-peptidewas decreased to 2.1 ± 0.2 % (in plasma) and 2.2 ± 0.4 % (in urine). For[68Ga]DOTA-peptide, it was decreased to 1.4 ± 0.3 % (in plasma) and 1.2 ± 0.4 %(in urine) at 60 min. The specific BT474 cell binding was 53.9 ± 0.8 % for[68Ga]NODAGA-peptide, 25.8 ± 1.4 % for [68Ga]-DOTA-peptide, and 18.8 ± 2.5 % for [68Ga]GaCl3 at 60 min. Inveon microPET/CT imaging at 1 h post-injection showedsignificantly (p < 0.05) higher tumor to muscle (T/M) ratio for[68Ga]NODAGA-peptide (3.4 ± 0.3) as compared to [68Ga]DOTA-peptide (1.8 ± 0.6).For [68Ga]GaCl3 and blocked mice, their ratios were 1.5 ± 0.6 and 1.5 ± 0.3respectively. The tissue distributions data were similar to the PET imaging data.CONCLUSION: NODAGA is superior to DOTA in terms of radiolabeling kinetics. Themethod of radiolabeling was reproducible and yielded higher specific activity.Although both agents have relatively low in vivo stability, PET/CT imagingstudies delineated BC tumors with [68Ga]NODAGA-peptide, but not with[68Ga]DOTA-peptide.DOI: 10.1007/s11307-018-1207-x PMID: 29802552
