Subsequently, dynamicsingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), computed tomography (CT), andSPECT/CT combination images were performed to identify the radioactive lymphvessels and internal mammary lymph nodes (IMLNs). The direction of lymph drainageand the location of the IMLNs were identified in the SPECT/CT imaging.Results: The radiochemical purity of 99mTc-Dextran 40 was >95%. 99mTc-Dextran 40 could drainage into first, second, and third lymph node and the radioactive lymphnode could be detected by the γ detector in the animal experiment. After99mTc-Dextran 40 injecting into intraparenchyma, 50.0% cases (15/30) wereidentified the drainage lymphatic vessels and radioactive IMLNs by SPECT. Thedrainage lymphatic vessel was found from injection point to the first IMLN(IM-SLN) after 10.5±0.35 minutes radiotracer injection, and then 99mTc-Dextran 40was accumulated into the IM-SLN. The combination imaging of SPECT/CT showed thesecond IMLN received the lymph drainage from the IM-SLN. The lymphatic drainagewas step by step in the internal mammary area.Conclusion: The lymph was identified to drain from different regions of thebreast to IM-SLN, and then outward from IM-SLN to other IMLN consecutively. Itdemonstrated the concept of the IM-SLN and provided more evidences for theapplication of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy.DOI: 10.4143/crt.2018.062 PMID: 29890814
