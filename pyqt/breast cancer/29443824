A random forest classifier,trained on the activPAL data, was used to detect sitting, standing, and sit-standtransitions in 5-s windows in the hip-worn accelerometer. The classifierestimates were compared with the standard accelerometer cut point, andsignificant differences across different bout lengths were investigated usingmixed-effect models.RESULTS: Overall, the algorithm predicted the postures with moderate accuracy(stepping, 77%; standing, 63%; sitting, 67%; sit-to-stand, 52%; and stand-to-sit,51%). Daily level analyses indicated that errors in transition estimates wereonly occurring during sitting bouts of 2 min or less. The standard cut point was significantly different from the activPAL across all bout lengths, overestimatingshort bouts and underestimating long bouts.CONCLUSIONS: This is among the first algorithms for sitting and standing forhip-worn accelerometer data to be trained from entirely free-living activPALdata. The new algorithm detected prolonged sitting, which has been shown to bethe most detrimental to health. Further validation and training in larger cohortsis warranted.DOI: 10.1249/MSS.0000000000001578 PMCID: PMC6023581PMID: 29443824
