Other than in BAP1 familial studies, nonmesothelialneoplasms in individuals with MM has not been comprehensively assessed.OBJECTIVE: - To assess the spectrum and prevalence of nonmesothelial neoplasms inindividuals with MM.DESIGN: - Individuals with MM and second neoplasms were identified from adatabase of 3900 MM cases. The expected prevalence of each type of neoplasm wascalculated and compared with the actual prevalence in the study population using available Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data and other publisheddata.RESULTS: - Two hundred seventy nonmesothelial neoplasms were identified in 241individuals (6% of the study population) with MM. Prostate adenocarcinoma wasmost common. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, lung carcinoma, urothelialcarcinoma, breast carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma,multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma, meningioma, pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, ocular melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma,liposarcoma, and Wilms tumor all were more prevalent than expected.CONCLUSIONS: - Nonmesothelial neoplasms are uncommon in individuals with MM, but certain tumor types are increased in prevalence. In an unselected studypopulation with respect to BAP1 status, the prevalence of several tumor typesdescribed in BAP1 mutation carriers, including lung carcinoma, clear cell renalcell carcinoma, breast carcinoma, meningioma, pleomorphic undifferentiatedsarcoma, and ocular melanoma, was increased.DOI: 10.5858/arpa.2017-0307-OA PMID: 29528717
