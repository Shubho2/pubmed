The associations between genetic variations of ATP-bindingcassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) genes and cancer survival wereinvestigated through a meta-analysis and an association study in the Seoul BreastCancer Study (SEBCS). Including the SEBCS, the meta-analysis was conducted among 38 studies of genetic variations of transporters on various cancer survivors. Thepopulation of SEBCS consisted of 1338 breast cancer patients who had been treatedwith adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 7750 SNPs were selected from 453 ABCand/or SLC genes typed by an Affymetrix 6.0 chip. ABCB1 rs1045642 was associated with poor progression-free survival in a meta-analysis (HR = 1.33, 95% CI:1.07-1.64). ABCB1, SLC8A1, and SLC12A8 were associated with breast cancersurvival in SEBCS (Pgene < 0.05). ABCB1 rs1202172 was differentially associatedwith survival depending on the chemotherapy (Pinteraction = 0.035). Our findingprovides suggestive associations of membrane transporters on cancer survival.DOI: 10.1038/s41397-018-0016-6 PMID: 29618765
