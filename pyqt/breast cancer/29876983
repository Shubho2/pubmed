They have been implicated in estrogen-mediated physiology, whichmakes them interesting targets of study, especially for biomedical applicationsin woman's health. The 1998 Women's Health Initiative sparked considerableinterest in natural alternatives to hormone replacement therapy, therebytriggering many additional studies on phytoestrogens. In this review, keyadvancements in dietary phytoestrogens are addressed, emphasizing their relation to breast pathophysiology. Recent developments such as clinical trials, precisebioassays for screening and selection of potential phytoestrogens, drug delivery systems to enhance bioavailability of therapeutically favorable phytoestrogens,regulatory guidelines on phytoestrogen-based supplements, and avenues that needfurther improvement are also discussed.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6115 PMID: 29876983
