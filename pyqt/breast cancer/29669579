We aimed to identify factors associated with diagnosis of large(> 2 cm) compared to small tumors, and to examine implications for long-termprognosis.METHODS: We examined 2012 women with invasive breast cancer, of whom 1466 hadscreen-detected and 546 interval cancers that were incident between 2001 and 2008in a population-based screening cohort, and followed them to 31 December 2015.Body mass index (BMI) was ascertained after diagnosis at the time of studyenrollment during 2009. PD was measured based on the contralateral mammogramwithin 3 years before diagnosis. We used multiple logistic regression modeling toexamine the association between tumor size and body mass index (BMI),mammographic percent density (PD), or hormonal and genetic risk factors.Associations between the identified risk factors and, in turn, the outcomes oflocal recurrence, distant metastases, and death (153 events in total) in womenwith breast cancer were examined using Cox regression. Analyses were carried out according to mode of detection.RESULTS: BMI and PD were the only factors associated with tumor size atdiagnosis. For BMI (≥25 vs. < 25 kg/m2), the multiple adjusted odds ratios (OR)were 1.37 (95% CI 1.02-1.83) and 2.12 (95% CI 1.41-3.18), for screen-detected andinterval cancers, respectively. For PD (≥20 vs. < 20%), the corresponding ORswere 1.72 (95% CI 1.29-2.30) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.40-0.90). Among women withinterval cancers, those with high BMI had worse prognosis than women with low BMI(hazard ratio 1.70; 95% CI 1.04-2.77), but PD was not associated with the hazard rate. Among screen-detected cancers, neither BMI nor PD was associated with thehazard rate.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, high BMI was associated with the risk of having atumor larger than 2 cm at diagnosis. Among women with interval cancer, high BMIwas associated with worse prognosis. We believe that women with high BMI shouldbe especially encouraged to attend screening.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0962-6 PMCID: PMC5907386PMID: 29669579
