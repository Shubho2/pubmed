Without symptom relief interventions, nearly 35% of these survivors will have life-altering and distressing cognitive symptoms. This pilot studyexplored associations between serum markers of vascular aging, laterality incerebral oxygenation, and severity of cognitive impairment in women, 12-18 monthsafter chemotherapy for stage 2/3 invasive ductal breast cancer. Fifteen women(52-84 years) underwent a brief cognitive assessment (Montreal CognitiveAssessment [MOCA]) and blood draws to assess markers of vascular aging(interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], C-reactive protein[CRP], and insulin growth factor-1 [IGF-1]). All underwent a computer-based test protocol that is known to increase blood flow within the frontal lobes. Percentcerebral oxyhemoglobin saturation (rcSO2) was recorded during and after testing. Laterality in rcSO2 was defined by ≥ 3% difference between left and right rcSO2(|rcSO2 meanRIGHT - meanLEFT|). Eight participants had MOCA scores between 21 and25 points, suggestive of mild cognitive impairment. Neither CRP (r = -.24) norIL-6 (r = .34) nor TNF-α (r = .002) were associated with MOCA scores. Higher IL-6was associated with greater laterality (r = .41). MOCA scores were significantly lower in subjects with laterality in rcSO2 than in those without laterality(F(1,14) = 13.5, p = 003). Lower IGF-1 was significantly associated with greater laterality (r = - .66, p = .007) and lower cognitive function (r = .58). Thesefindings suggest that persistent cognitive impairment is associated withphenotypical changes consistent with accelerated vascular aging.DOI: 10.1007/s11357-018-0025-z PMCID: PMC6060197PMID: 29804200
