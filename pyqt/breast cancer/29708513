Since DNA methylation-induced silencing of tumor suppressors is common in cancer, reversal of promoter DNA hypermethylation by5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine), an FDA-approved DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)inhibitor, has proven effective in treating hematological neoplasms. However, itsantitumor effect varies in solid tumors, stressing the importance of identifying biomarkers predictive of therapeutic response. Here, we focused on theidentification of biomarkers to select decitabine-sensitive TNBC throughincreasing our understanding of the mechanism of decitabine action. We showedthat protein levels of DNMTs correlated with response to decitabine inpatient-derived xenograft (PDX) organoids originating from chemotherapy-sensitiveand -resistant TNBCs, suggesting DNMT levels as potential biomarkers of response.Furthermore, all 3 methytransferases, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, were degradedfollowing low-concentration, long-term decitabine treatment both in vitro and in vivo. The DNMT proteins could be ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase, TNFreceptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), leading to lysosome-dependent proteindegradation. Depletion of TRAF6 blocked decitabine-induced DNMT degradation,conferring resistance to decitabine. Our study suggests a potential mechanism of regulating DNMT protein degradation and DNMT levels as response biomarkers forDNMT inhibitors in TNBCs.DOI: 10.1172/JCI97924 PMCID: PMC5983332 [Available on 2018-09-01]PMID: 29708513
