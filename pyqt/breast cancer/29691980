During pregnancy, maternal glucocorticoid levels can be elevated by stress or exogenousadministration. We hypothesized that glucocorticoids modulate the expression ofABCB1/P-gp and ABCG2/BCRP in the first trimester human placenta. Our objectivewas to examine whether dexamethasone (DEX) or cortisol modulate first trimesterplacental expression of multidrug transporters and determine whethercytotrophoblasts or the syncytiotrophoblast are/is responsible for mediatingthese effects. Three models were examined: (i) an ex-vivo model of placentalvillous explants (7-10 weeks), (ii) a model of isolated first trimestersyncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells and (iii) the BeWo immortalizedtrophoblast cell line model. These cells/tissues were treated with DEX orcortisol for 24 hour to 72 hour. In first trimester placental explants, DEX(48 hour) increased ABCB1 (P < .001) and ABCG2 (P < .05) mRNA levels, whereascortisol (48 hour) only increased ABCB1 mRNA levels (P < .01). Dexamethasone(P < .05) and cortisol (P < .01) increased BCRP but did not affect P-gp proteinlevels. Breast cancer resistance protein expression was primarily confined tosyncytiotrophoblasts. BeWo cells, when syncytialized with forskolin, increasedexpression of BCRP protein, and this was further augmented by DEX (P < .05). Our data suggest that the protective barrier provided by BCRP increases ascytotrophoblasts fuse to form the syncytiotrophoblast. Increase in glucocorticoidlevels during the first trimester may reduce embryo/foetal exposure to clinicallyrelevant BCRP substrates, because of an increase in placental BCRP.© 2018 The Authors.
