A retrospective review of the medical records was performed toidentify all patients without a known history of breast cancer, who had anincidentally discovered breast lesion detected on a nonbreast imaging examinationperformed at our institution between September 2008 and August 2012 for thisIRB-approved, HIPAA compliant study. Outcomes of the incidental lesions weredetermined by follow-up with dedicated breast imaging (mammography, breastultrasound, and/or breast MRI) or results of biopsy, if performed. Imagingmodality of detection, imaging features, patient age, patient location at thetime of the nonbreast imaging examination, type of follow-up, and final outcomewere recorded. Rates of malignancy were also calculated, and comparison was made across the different cross-sectional imaging modalities. Kruskal-Wallis andFisher's exact tests were used to identify factors associated with an increasedrate of malignancy. Logistic regression was used to model the risk of malignancy as a function of continuous predictors (such as patient age or lesion size); oddsratios and 95% confidence intervals were obtained. A total of 292 patients withincidental breast lesions were identified, 242 of whom had incidental lesionswere noted on computed tomography (CT) studies, 25 on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 25 on positron emission tomography (PET). Although most of theincidental breast lesions were detected on CT examinations, PET studies had thehighest rate of detection of incidental breast lesions per number of studiesperformed (rate of incidental breast lesion detection on PET studies was 0.29%,compared to 0.10% for CT and 0.01% for MRI). Of the 121 of 292 (41%) patients whoreceived dedicated breast imaging work-up at our institution, 40 of 121 (33%)underwent biopsy and 25 of 121 (21%) had malignancy. There was a significantlyincreased rate of malignancy in older patients (odds ratio: 1.05, 95% CI:1.02-1.093; P = .006). Additionally, patients with PET-detected incidental breastlesions had a significantly higher rate of malignancy (55%), compared to patientswith CT-detected (35%) and MRI-detected (8%) incidental breast lesions (P =.038). The rate of malignancy upon follow-up of incidental breast lesionsdetected on nonbreast imaging examinations in this retrospective study was 21%,supporting the importance of emphasizing further work-up of all incidentallydetected breast lesions with dedicated breast imaging. Additionally, we foundthat PET examinations had the highest rate of detection of incidental breastlesions and the highest rate of malignancy, which suggests that PET examinations may be more specific for predicting the likelihood of malignancy of incidentalbreast lesions, compared to CT and MRI.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13040 PMID: 29687537
