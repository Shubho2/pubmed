Complete loss of its function is lethalduring early embryonic development. Patients who are compound heterozygous forBRCA1 truncating mutations and missense alleles that retain some DNA repaircapacity may survive, albeit with very high risk of early onset breast or ovariancancer and features of Fanconi anemia. However, a mechanism enabling survival of patients homozygous for BRCA1 truncating mutations has not been described. Westudied two unrelated families in which four children presented with multiplecongenital anomalies and severe chromosomal fragility. One child developed T cellacute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and a second child developed neuroblastoma.Each of the four children was homozygous for a nonsense mutation in BRCA1 exon11. Homozygosity for the nonsense mutations was viable thanks to the presence of a naturally occurring alternative splice donor in BRCA1 exon 11 that lies 5' ofthe mutations. The mutations did not affect the alternative splice site, buttranscription from it produced an in-frame BRCA1 message with deletion of 3,309bp. The translated BRCA1 protein was only 40% of normal length, but with intactN- and C-terminal sequences. These patients extend the range of BRCA1-relatedphenotypes and illustrate how naturally occurring alternative splicing can enablesurvival, albeit with severe consequences, of otherwise lethal genotypes of anessential gene.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1801796115 PMCID: PMC5960323 [Available on 2018-11-15]PMID: 29712865
