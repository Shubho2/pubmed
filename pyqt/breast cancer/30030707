OBC has been conventionally considered as ametastatic lymph node lesion, the origin of which is an undetectable breasttumor. Therefore, OBC patients would usually have undergone axillary lymph nodedissection, and mastectomy or whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT). However, majorityof OBC reports have been based on cases that were diagnosed during a period when diagnostics was still relatively primitive, and when magnetic resonance imagingwas not yet a standard preoperative assessment. Therefore, there have been manyfalse negatives in the breast based on preoperative assessment.METHODS: We herein hypothesize that the origin of OBC is ectopic breast tissuepresent in axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). If our hypothesis is true, mastectomy andWBRT may be unnecessary for OBC patients.RESULTS: Our hypothesis is supported by several findings. First, advances inradiological imaging have suggested that a primary breast tumor is absent in OBC patients. Second, proliferative breast lesions arising from ectopic breastpresent in ALNs have been reported. Lastly, cellular subtypes in OBC based onimmunohistochemistry are of various types including ordinary breast cancer andthe prognosis is not worse than stage II breast cancer.CONCLUSION: It is important to distinguish between "primary" OBC in ALNs and"metastatic" OBC from micro-primary breast tumor. Further studies are required todetermine if omission of mastectomy and WBRT is acceptable.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4898-4 PMID: 30030707
