Foetal and/or postnatalexposure to low doses of BPA alters tissue organisation through epithelialproliferation and stroma-epithelial interactions. BPA also alters the expression of E2-dependent epithelial and stroma transcriptomes. Several signalling pathwaysare consistent with the observed phenotype: proliferation and apoptosis, a focal adhesion pathway indicating changes in biomechanical properties of theextracellular matrix, and immune function. Some of BPA's effects are reversed by oestrogen and/or GPER inhibitors. BPA also alters the expression of epigeneticmarks (EZH2, HOTAIR), which would explain the delayed effect of foetal BPAexposure. In conclusion, experimental evidence shows that pre- or postnatal BPAexposure consistently causes endocrine modifications in the mammary tissue ofdifferent animal species, disrupting stromal-epithelial interactions andultimately increasing its susceptibility to carcinogens. An interspeciescomparison highlights why and how these effects apply to humans.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.DOI: 10.1016/j.mce.2018.06.015 PMID: 30048677
