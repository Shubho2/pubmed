[Epub ahead of print]Pre-diagnostic plasma concentrations of Fibrinogen, sGPIIb/IIIa, sP-selectin,sThrombomodulin, Thrombopoietin in relation to cancer risk: Findings from a largeprospective study.Graf ME(1), Sookthai D(1), Johnson T(1), Schübel R(1), González Maldonado S(1),Pletsch-Borba L(1), Katzke V(1), Bugert P(2), Hoffmeister M(3), Kaaks R(1), Kühn T(1).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ),Heidelberg, Germany.(2)Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Immunology, Heidelberg University,Medical Faculty Mannheim, and German Red Cross Blood ServiceBaden-Württemberg-Hessen, Mannheim, Germany.(3)Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer ResearchCenter (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.While enhanced platelet activation may drive cancer progression and metastases,less is known about its role in early cancer development. Thus, we evaluatedwhether pre-diagnostic biomarkers of platelet activation and coagulation arerelated to the risks of common cancers in the prospective EPIC-Heidelberg Studyusing a case-cohort design. Levels of fibrinogen, soluble glycoprotein (sGP)IIb/IIIa, soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), andthrombopoietin (TPO) were measured in baseline plasma samples of a randomsubcohort (n=2,480) and incident cases of breast (n=605), prostate (n=543), andcolorectal cancer (n=249). Multivariable Cox regression models revealed nostatistically significant associations between biomarker concentrations and anyof the cancer endpoints. Subgroup analyses showed a significant inverserelationship between TPO and colorectal cancer among men, with a hazard ratio(HR, highest vs. lowest quartile) of 0.60 (95% confidence interval: 0.37,0.95),whereas no significant association was observed among women. With regard tofibrinogen levels and breast cancer risk, there was a significant positiveassociation among nulliparous women (HR: 2.53 [95% CI: 1.21, 5.30]), but notamong parous women. Overall, our data suggest that enhanced platelet activationand a pro-coagulative state may not be related to increased risks of commoncancers, although studies on other potential biomarkers of platelet activationand further cancer types are needed. Findings from our subgroup analyses require further investigation, as potential underlying mechanisms are not known. Thisarticle is protected by copyright.
