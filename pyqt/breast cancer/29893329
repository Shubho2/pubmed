The increased intratumoral and stromal TILs (sTILs) in breast cancer (BC) have significant prognostic effects. In this study, we evaluated whether pCRrates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) are higher in tumors with increasednumber of TILs in the pretreatment biopsy.Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the number of TILs inintratumoral TILs (iTILs) and sTILs compartments from pretreatment full-facehematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of 62 patients with locally advanced BC(LABC) who received NACT. The capacity of sTILs and iTILs in predicting pCR toNACT in LABC analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curveanalysis.Results: According to ROC curve analysis, the optimum sTILs and iTILs cut-offpoints (the number of positive cells per square millimeter of tissue) forpatients with LABC patients with pCR (+) were 19 (area under the curve (AUC):0.668, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.501-0.835],P = 0.064) and 4 (AUC: 0.786,95%CI [0.666-0.907],P = 0.002), respectively. Of the 62 patients, 26 had sTILs>19 and 25 had iTILs >4. The patients were divided into two according to percent of sTILs (sTILs >19 and sTILs ≤19 groups) and iTILs (iTILs >4 and iTILs ≤4groups). Both sTILs >19 and iTILs >4 patients were associated with developmenthigher pCR. While pCR was significantly higher in iTILs >4 patients (P = 0.002), it was not significantly in sTILs >19 patients (P = 0.107).Conclusions: There is significantly an association between pCR and increasednumber of intratumoral TILs (>4 cells/mm 2 of tissue) in BC who received NACT.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.174550 PMID: 29893329
