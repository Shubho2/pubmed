Electronic address:ghjiang_cn@zstu.edu.cn.Herein, dual stimuli-responsive compound vesicles were constructed based onhost-guest interaction between a water-soluble pillar[6]arene (WP6) and anamphiphilic azobenzene-containing block copolymers (BCP). Reversiblemorphological transformation between compound vesicles and solid aggregates wasachieved by repeated pH- and photo-stimuli. These compound vesicles were thenapplied in the controlled release of water-soluble anticancer drug, doxorubicinhydrochloride (DOX · HCl). Upon external stimuli, the DOX · HCl displayed afaster release rate than that without stimuli. Moreover, the compound vesiclesshowed an excellent cytocompatibility toward the human breast cancer cells(Michigan Cancer Foundation-7, MCF-7), and the drug-loaded compound vesiclesexhibited lower cytotoxicity than free drug. The drug-loaded compound vesiclescould be taken up by MCF-7 cells and can release the DOX · HCl in cancer cellsdue to the acid environment, which was important for applications in the therapy of cancers as a controlled-release drug carrier.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
