Its ability to predict breast cancer risk in women wasalso assessed but the conclusions were inconsistent. The present study concernsthe relationship between the BRCA1-3’UTR germline variant rs8176318G>T andsusceptibility to Breast cancer in an ethnic population of Saudi Arabia.Methodology: The study included 100 breast cancer patients and 100 sex matchedhealthy controls from the northwestern region (Tabuk) and Dammam of Saudi Arabia were investigated for the BRCA1-3’UTR germline variant rs8176318G>T using anallele specific PCR technique. Genotype distributions were then compared.Results: The frequencies of the three genotypes GG, TT and GT in our SaudiArabian patients were 26%, 8% and 66% and in healthy controls were 45%, 5% and50%, respectively (p=0.03). Risk of developing breast cancer was found to besignificantly associated with the GT variant (OR 2.28, 1.24-4.191; RR 1.47,1.11-1.93; P=0.007), GT+TT (OR, 2.32, 1.28-4.22; RR 1.48, 1.13-1.94; P=0.005) andthe T allele (OR 1.62 , 1.072- 2.45; RR 1.28, 1.02-1.60: P=0.020). There were2.76 and 2.28 fold increase risks of developing breast cancer associated with theTT and GT genotypes in our cases. A significant correlation was also foundbetween the BRCA1 3’UTR variants with the stage of the disease and distantmetastasis but not with age, grade, and ER, PR and her2/neu status. Conclusion : The rs8176318G/T in the 3’untranslated region (UTR) of the BRCA1 gene was foundto be associatedwith increased susceptibility to breast cancer in our studypopulation, increased risk being noted with the GT and TT genotypes. Furtherassociation studies are needed to confirm this finding in other regions of Saudi Arabia.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.3.859 PMCID: PMC5980867PMID: 29582646
