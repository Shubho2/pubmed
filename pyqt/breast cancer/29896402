Distinguishing between malignant tumors of salivary gland originand metastatic RCC is very important. The case of a 75-year-old man with an oral cavity lesion in the left buccal submucosa measuring 40Ã—30 mm that had grownsubstantially over several weeks is presented. His medical history included left kidney cancer 26 years earlier and a malignant myoepithelioma of the left buccal region 7 years earlier. It was suspected that this lesion was a recurrentmalignant myoepithelioma as it appeared at the same site as the previousoperation. Surgery was performed, and metastatic RCC was confirmed uponpathological examination. The diagnosis of metastatic RCC was made byimmunohistochemical examination, which also excluded malignant myoepithelioma andother clear cell carcinomas of salivary gland origin. Metastatic RCC must beconsidered in the differential diagnosis of a new oral cavity lesion presentingin a patient with a past history of kidney cancer. Thus, immunohistochemicalstaining is required to distinguish malignancies of salivary gland origin,including malignant myoepithelioma, from metastatic RCC.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2018.1630 PMCID: PMC5995212PMID: 29896402
