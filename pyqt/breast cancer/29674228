That requires bothaccurate delineations of major tissues, in this case by segmentation of priorB-mode images, and calibration of the relative positions of the opposedtransducers. Experimental sensitivity evaluation of the reconstructions withrespect to segmentation and calibration errors is difficult with our currentsystem. Therefore, parametric studies of SOS errors in our bent-rayreconstructions were simulated. They included mis-segmentation of an object ofinterest or a nearby object, and miscalibration of relative transducer positions in 3D. Close correspondence of reconstruction accuracy was verified in thesimplest case, a cylindrical object in homogeneous background with inducedsegmentation and calibration inaccuracies. Simulated mis-segmentation in objectsize and lateral location produced maximum SOS errors of 6.3% within 10 mmdiameter change and 9.1% within 5 mm shift, respectively. Modest errors inassumed transducer separation produced the maximum SOS error from miscalibrations(57.3% within 5 mm shift), still, correction of this type of error can easily be achieved in the clinic. This study should aid in designing adequate transducermounts and calibration procedures, and in specification of B-mode image qualityand segmentation algorithms for limited angle transmission tomography relying on ray tracing algorithms.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
