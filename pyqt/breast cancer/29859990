[Epub ahead of print]Secretome within the bone marrow microenvironment: A basis for mesenchymal stemcell treatment and role in cancer dormancy.Eltoukhy HS(1), Sinha G(1), Moore CA(1), Gergues M(1), Rameshwar P(2).Author information: (1)Department of Medicine - Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rutgers, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.(2)Department of Medicine - Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rutgers, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA. Electronic address:rameshwa@njms.rutgers.edu.The secretome produced by cells within the bone marrow is significant tohomeostasis. The bone marrow, a well-studied organ, has multiple niches withdistinct roles for supporting stem cell functions. Thus, an understanding ofmediators involved in the regulation of stem cells could serve as a model forclinical problems and solutions such as tissue repair and regeneration. Theexosome secretome of bone marrow stem cells is a developing area of research withrespect to the regenerative potential by bone marrow cell, particularly themesenchymal stem cells. The bone marrow niche regulates endogenous processes suchas hematopoiesis but could also support the survival of tumors such asfacilitating the cancer stem cells to exist in dormancy for decades. The bonemarrow-derived secretome will be critical to future development of therapeuticstrategies for oncologic diseases, in addition to regenerative medicine. Thisarticle discusses the importance for parallel studies to determine how the samesecretome may compromise safety during the use of stem cells in regenerativemedicine.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et BiologieMoléculaire (SFBBM).
