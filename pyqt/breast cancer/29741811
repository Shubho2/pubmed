In breast cancer, particularly in the aggressivetriple-negative/basal-like subgroup, patient outcome is strongly associated with the tumor's inflammatory profile. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are amongthe most abundant immune cells in the TME, shown to be linked to poor prognosisand therapeutic resistance. In this study, we investigated the effect of themetastasis- and inflammation-associated microenvironmental factor S100A4 onbreast cancer cells (BCCs) of different subtypes and explored their furtherinteractions with myeloid cells. We demonstrated that extracellular S100A4activates BCCs, particularly the basal-like subtype, to elevate secretion ofpro-inflammatory cytokines. The secreted factors promoted conversion of monocytesto TAM-like cells that exhibited protumorigenic activities: stimulatedepithelial-mesenchymal transition, proliferation, chemoresistance, and motilityin cancer cells. In conclusion, we have shown that extracellular S100A4instigates a tumor-supportive microenvironment, involving a network of cytokines and TAM-like cells, which was particularly characteristic for basal-like BCCs andpotentiated their aggressive properties. The S100A4-BCC-TAM interaction cascadecould be an important contributor to the aggressive behavior of this subtype and should be further explored for therapeutic targeting.© 2018 The Authors.
