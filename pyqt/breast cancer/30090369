In this study,low-doses of chemotherapeutic drugs (LDCD) - doxorubicin (DOX), etoposide (ETOP),and busulfan (BUS) were used to ascertain the effect of residual concentrationsof drugs on breast cancer cells. Our results showed that exposure to LDCD caused significant induction of ROS, early signs of apoptosis and accumulation of cells in S and G2-M phases of the cell cycle in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Under drug-free recovery conditions, a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells and anincrease in the number of colonies formed were observed. Analysis of themolecular mechanism showed lower expression of cleaved products of caspase 3, 9, PARP and occurrence of DNA strand breaks in recovered cells compared toLDCD-treated cells, suggesting incomplete cell death activation and survival ofcells with genomic damage after therapeutic insult. Thus, LDCD induces defective apoptosis in cancer cells allowing a small population of cells to escape fromcell cycle check points and survive with accumulated genetic damage that couldeventually result in secondary cancers that warrants further studies for bettertherapeutic strategies.DOI: 10.1039/c5tx00391a PMCID: PMC6062221PMID: 30090369
