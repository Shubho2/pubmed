Epub 2018 Mar 14.Daily or weekly dosing with EGFR inhibitors, gefitinib and lapatinib, and AKtinhibitor MK2206 in mammary cancer models.Lubet RA(1), Steele VE(1), Juliana MM(2), Bode A(3), Moeinpour F(2), GrubbsCJ(2).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20852, USA.(2)Department of Surgery, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL35294, USA.(3)Division of Cancer Biomarkers and Drug Resistance, University of MinnesotaHormel Institute, Austin, MN 55912, USA.Daily vs. weekly dosing with EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib and lapatinib) and an AKTinhibitor (MK2206) were compared in two rodent breast cancer models. FemaleSprague-Dawley rats were administered methylnitrosourea (MNU) at 50 days of age, and gefitinib (daily/weekly dosing at 10/70 mg/kg BW) or lapatinib (daily/weekly dosing at 75/525 mg/kg BW) were administered by gavage beginning 5 days afterMNU. For the prevention studies, weekly or daily dosing with gefitinib orlapatinib reduced cancer multiplicity >75%, and all treatments reduced tumorweights by >90%. For the therapeutic studies, MNU-treated rats were followeduntil small palpable mammary cancers developed. The rats were then treated daily or weekly as above for 6 weeks. Either daily or weekly dosing with lapatinib orgefitinib caused regression in >50% of the tumors. Immunohistochemistry biomarkerstudies in palpable mammary cancers following a weekly dose of gefitinib showedthat 1 day (but not 7 days) after treatment, the levels of phosphorylated EGFR1were significantly decreased. In an ER-negative (ER-) Neu-overexpressing modelemploying MMTV-Neu/P53KO mice, daily (100 mg/kg BW/day, 5 days each week), orweekly dosing (500 or 250 mg/kg BW) with gefitinib reduced tumor multiplicity 65,85 and 75%, respectively. In the MNU prevention model, daily dosing (100 mg/kgBW/day) with the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206 was ineffective, while weeklydosing (700 mg/kg BW) reduced the final tumor weight >70%. Combining weeklyMK2206 with the aromatase inhibitor vorozole (0.12 mg/kg BW/day) showed that eachcompound alone reduced tumor multiplicity 40-50%. The combination reduced cancer multiplicity ~70%. These studies demonstrate the efficacy of weekly dosing withvarious protein kinase inhibitors; raising the possibility of employing theseagents in a breast cancer preventive setting.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6313 PMID: 29565450
