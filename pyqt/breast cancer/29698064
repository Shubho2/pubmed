In the following two case reports, we describecases of adenocarcinoma and breast carcinoma that metastasized into anintracranial meningioma. The first patient was a 64-year-old man presenting tothe emergency department with seizures and loss of consciousness. After a leftfrontal mass resection, pathology reported a heterogeneous mass consisting of ameningioma and a metastatic adenocarcinoma component. The second patient was a63-year-old woman presenting with significant vision problems and unstable gait. After a right frontal mass resection, pathology reported a heterogeneous massconsisting of a meningioma and a metastatic breast carcinoma component. Possible explanations for the development of the tumor-to-tumor metastasis are described.DOI: 10.2217/cns-2017-0022 PMCID: PMC5977278PMID: 29698064
