China.(3)Yubei District People's Hospital of Chongqing, Chongqing 401120, P.R. China.Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) is a member of the BMP family, which isinvolved in the regulation of tumor biogenesis, development and metastasis. Thepresent study aimed to investigate whether BMP9 inhibits the growth of MDA‑MB‑231breast cancer cells via the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalingpathway. It was shown that the expression level of BMP9 was significantlydecreased, while that of phosphorylated Akt (p‑Akt) was markedly increased inbreast cancer tissues compared with these levels in the normal adjacent tissues. An adenovirus overexpressing BMP9 was used to infect the MDA‑MB‑231 cells. Theexpression level of p‑Akt in the MDA‑MB‑231/BMP9 group was shown to besignificantly lower than that in the MDA‑MB‑231/green fluorescent protein (GFP)and MDA‑MB‑231 control groups. The expression levels of cyclins D1, B1 and E1,c‑Myc and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) in the MDA‑MB‑231/BMP9 group werealso reduced. The generation of a nude mouse xenograft tumor model revealed that the tumor volumes of the MDA‑MB‑231/BMP9 group (0.32±0.05 cm3) was significantly lower compared with that of the MDA‑MB‑231/GFP (1.10±0.05 cm3) and MDA‑MB‑231(1.12±0.12 cm3) groups, and the expression level of p‑Akt protein in theMDA‑MB‑231/BMP9 group was significantly lower compared with that of theMDA‑MB‑231/GFP and MDA‑MB‑231 groups in the nude mouse xenograft model. Takentogether, these results indicate that BMP9 inhibits the growth of MDA‑MB‑231breast cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway both in vivo andin vitro.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6572 PMID: 30015950
