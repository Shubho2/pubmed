However little is known about how integrated careplans for cancer patients are developed including featured core activities,facilitators for uptake and indicators for assessing impact.Methods: Given limited consensus around what constitutes an integrated care plan for cancer patients, a scoping review was conducted to explore the components of integrated care plans and contextual factors that influence design and uptake.Results: Five types of integrated care plans based on the stage of cancer care:surgical, systemic, survivorship, palliative and comprehensive (involving atransition between stages) are described in current literature. Breast,esophageal and colorectal cancers were common disease sites. Multi-disciplinaryteams, patient needs assessment and transitional planning emerged as keyfeatures. Provider buy-in and training alongside informational technology supportserved as important facilitators for plan uptake. Provider-level measurement was considerably less robust compared to patient and system-level indicators.Conclusions: Similarities in design features, components and facilitators across the various types of integrated care plans indicates opportunities to leverageshared features and enable a management lens that spans the trajectory of apatient's journey rather than a phase-specific silo approach to care.DOI: 10.5334/ijic.2543 PMCID: PMC5853967PMID: 29588638
