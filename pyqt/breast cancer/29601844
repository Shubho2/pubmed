Electronic address: rpietras@mednet.ucla.edu.Dr. Clara M. Szego passed away recently at the age of 101. She was a pioneer inthe study of steroid hormone action, particularly the role of estrogens in targettissues. She was first to report on steroid hormone binding with proteins in the circulation in 1946. This observation led to a Ciba Foundation Award of theEndocrine Society in 1953. Claire then followed the steroid hormone and reported on interactions with membrane-associated and nuclear proteins in target cells of the reproductive tract and breast. She was also an advocate to stop the use ofdiethylstilbestrol (DES) in animal feed in the 1950s-1960s and later helped todevelop clinical tests to identify women at risk for developing malignancy after exposure to DES in utero. Being a woman in endocrinology was challenging in thepost-war period, and Claire worked to hinder gender bias in academia throughouther career. Her impact on the fields of endocrinology and steroid hormone action was profound, and the full ramifications and clinical benefits of her work remainto be realized.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
