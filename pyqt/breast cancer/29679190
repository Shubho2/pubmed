Worry andrisk reminders may include physical symptoms (e.g., persistent breast pain) andcaregiving experiences. Women who engage in pain catastrophizing may beparticularly likely to experience increased distress when risk reminders arepresent. We examined the degree to which persistent breast pain and experience asa cancer caregiver were related to cancer worry and perceived risk infirst-degree relatives of women with breast cancer (N = 85) and how catastrophic thoughts about breast pain could impact these relationships. There was asignificant interaction between persistent breast pain and pain catastrophizingin predicting cancer worry (p = .03); among women who engaged in paincatastrophizing, cancer worry remained high even in the absence of breast pain.Pain catastrophizing also moderated the relationships between caregivinginvolvement and cancer worry (p = .003) and perceived risk (p = .03). As thedegree of caregiving responsibility increased, cancer worry and perceived riskincreased for women who engaged in pain catastrophizing; levels of cancer worryand perceived risk remained low and stable for women who did not engage in paincatastrophizing regardless of caregiving experience. The results suggest thatfirst-degree relatives of breast cancer survivors who engage in paincatastrophizing may experience greater cancer worry and perceived risk and maybenefit from interventions aimed at reducing catastrophic thoughts about pain.DOI: 10.1007/s10689-018-0082-6 PMID: 29679190
