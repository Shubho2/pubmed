The concept of screening for lung cancer using low-dosecomputed tomography (LDCT) dates back almost three decades. This paper reviewsthe randomized controlled trials and demonstration projects carried outworld-wide on LDCT lung cancer screening. Most research has been carried out inNorth America, Europe and East Asia, regions where lung cancer mortality ratesare generally the highest. There are currently no organized national or regional lung cancer screening programs with LDCT. A number of challenges exist toimplementing such programs, including the fact that LDCT lung cancer screeninggenerally targets only high risk ever-smokers, in contrast to screening programs for other cancers such as breast, cervical and colorectal, which target entirepopulations based only on age and sex. While tobacco control remains the mostimportant tool in the long-term to decrease morbidity and mortality from lungcancer, LDCT screening, appropriately carried out, has the potential to modestly decrease lung cancer death rates for those countries whose overall resources and health care infrastructure are adequate for the task.DOI: 10.21037/tlcr.2018.05.12 PMCID: PMC6037972PMID: 30050762
