Intact and viable tumor cells areneeded for genetic characterization of CTCs, new drug development, and otherresearch. Although separation of CTCs using spiral channel with two outlets hasbeen reported, few literature demonstrated simultaneous isolation of differenttypes of CTCs from human blood using cascaded inertial focusing microfluidicchannel. Herein, we introduce a cascaded microfluidic device consisting of twospiral channels and one zigzag channel designed with different fluid fields,including lift force, Dean drag force, and centrifugal force. Both red bloodcells (RBCs)-lysed human blood spiked with CTCs and 1:50 diluted human wholeblood spiked with CTCs were tested on the presented chip. This chip successfully separated RBCs, white blood cells (WBCs), and two different types of tumor cells (human lung cancer cells (A549) and human breast cancer cells (MCF-7))simultaneously based on their physical properties. A total of 80.75% of A549 and 73.75% of MCF-7 were faithfully separated from human whole blood. Furthermore,CTCs gathered from outlets could propagate and remained intact. The cellviability of A549 and MCF-7 were 95% and 98%, respectively. The entire separatingprocess for CTCs from blood cells could be finished within 20 min. The cascadedmicrofluidic device introduced in this study serves as a novel platform forsimultaneous isolation of multiple types of CTCs from patient blood.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04210 PMID: 29537252
