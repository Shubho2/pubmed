MDSCs can express IDOand promote immune tolerance via expansion of Treg cell.METHOD: We use needle biopsy breast cancer tissues prior to neoadjuvantchemotherapy(NCT) staining for CD33, Foxp3 and IDO by immunohistochemistry toevaluate whether they were correlated with subsequent treatment responses inbreast cancer.RESULTS: Expressions of IDO, CD33+MDSCs and Foxp3+Tregs were correlated with eachother. Immunohistochemical double staining revealed that IDO expression inCD33+MDSCs was positively correlated with Foxp3+Tregs (P < 0.05). CD33+MDSCs,Foxp3+Tregs, and IDO expression in tumor tissues were associated with advancedclinical stage prior to NCT (P < 0.05). CD33+MDSCs, Foxp3+Tregs, IDO expression, IDO expression in CD33+MDSCs and clinical T3-T4 stage prior to NCT, pathological T3-T4 stage, ER(+), luminal type were correlated with clinical responses of PD+SD(P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that CD33+MDSCs, IDO expression, IDOexpression in CD33+MDSCs, and advanced pathological T stage were risk factors forPD+SD. Focusing on the pCR of NCT, only CD33+MDSCs, clinical T3-T4, and N1-N3stage prior to NCT were associated with no-pCR (P < 0.05). The multivariateanalysis showed that advanced clinical T stage and N stage were risk factors for no-pCR. Clinical stage prior to NCT were significantly correlated withprogression free survival (P = 0.021), while Foxp3+Tregs and clinical T stagewere significantly correlated with overall survival (P = 0.022 and P = 0.001,respectively). Foxp3+Treg was significant risk factor for overall survival after adjusting covariates by COX regression.CONCLUSION: Tumor-infiltrating MDSCs, Tregs, IDO expression and IDO expression inMDSCs were correlated with clinicopathological features, NCT response, andprognosis of breast cancer patients, suggesting that they might be potentialmarkers for clinical outcomes of NCT and help clinical decision-making forimproved therapies for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2018.1450116 PMCID: PMC6067871 [Available on 2019-05-08]PMID: 29621426
