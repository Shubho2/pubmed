The rate of clinical complete responses in the treatment of breast cancer patients is increasing;additionally, a change to targeted axillary dissection is being considered after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Consequently, marker clips are needed which are reliable and easy to handle even in the axillary lymph node system.Methods: A total of 50 patients from the Breast Care Unit of the Kliniken EssenMitte were included. Clip marking of all 50 primary breast cancer lesions as wellas 23 lymph nodes was performed using the Tumark Vision® clip. Followingapplication, the position and visibility of the marker clip were monitored anddocumented in 2 axes.Results: The feasibility of the Tumark Vision clip was excellent in everydayclinical practice as none of the markers dislocated. After clip marking of thetumor region and/or suspicious lymph nodes, all Tumark Vision clips could bedetected in both axes. The 3D shape could be observed in all cases afterapplication.Conclusion: The new 3D-shaped marker clip seems to be a promising tool formarking breast cancer lesions and even lymph nodes before NACT. As there are manystudies ongoing to prove the feasibility of a shift from standard axillarydissection after NACT towards targeted axillary dissection, the Tumark Visionclip seems to provide good visibility even in lymph nodes after NACT. Furtherstudies are warranted.DOI: 10.1159/000486388 PMCID: PMC5981593 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29887788
