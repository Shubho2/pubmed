Here, we describe a microfluidic method to generate a perfusablevascular network that can form inside 3D multicellular spheroids and functionallyconnect to microchannels. Multicellular spheroids containing endothelial cellsand lung fibroblasts were embedded within a hydrogel inside a microchannel, andthen, endothelial cells were seeded into both sides of the hydrogel so thatangiogenic sprouts from the cell spheroids and the microchannels were anastomosedto form a 3D vascular network. Solution containing cells and reagents can beperfused inside the cell spheroids through the vascular network by injecting itinto a microchannel. This method can be used to study cancer cell migrationtowards 3D co-culture spheroids through a vascular network. We recapitulated abone-like microenvironment by culturing multicellular spheroids containingosteo-differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as well as endothelial cells,and fibroblasts in the device. After the formation of vascularized spheroids,breast cancer cells were injected into a microchannel connected to a vascularnetwork and cultured for 7â€‰days on-chip to monitor cellular migration. Wedemonstrated that migration rates of the breast cancer cells towardsmulticellular spheroids via blood vessels were significantly higher in thebone-like microenvironment compared with the microenvironment formed byundifferentiated MSCs. These findings demonstrate the potential value of the 3Dvascularized spheroids-on-a-chip for modeling in vivo-like cellularmicroenvironments, drug delivery through blood vessels, and cellular interactionsthrough a vascular network.DOI: 10.1063/1.5027183 PMCID: PMC5955719 [Available on 2019-05-16]PMID: 29861815
