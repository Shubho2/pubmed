Electronic address: ghsong@korea.ac.kr.C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) is a small chemokine which belongs to theCC-type chemokine family, and has chemoattractant activity for recruitment ofmonocytes to sites of inflammation. Overexpressed CCL2 binding to its receptorC-C chemokine receptor 2 increases the risk of breast cancer in humans, but itseffects on proliferation of bovine mammary epithelial cells is not known.Maintaining a high level of proliferative activity in bovine mammary epithelialcells during lactation is important for improving milk yield and can benefit the dairy industry economically. In the present study, we demonstrated that CCL2induces proliferation of MAC-T cells, a bovine mammary epithelial cell line, and stimulates progression of the cell cycle through stimulation of expression ofcyclin D1. Moreover, CCL2 activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT [AKT,P70-S6 kinase 1 (P70S6K), ribosomal protein S6 (S6)] and mitogen activatedprotein kinase (MAPK) [extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and P38] pathways, which are involved in proliferationof MAC-T cells, as evidenced by co-treatment of MAC-T cells with pharmacological inhibitors of cell signaling transcription factors including Wortmannin, U0126,and SP600125. The CCL2 in MAC-T cells attenuates endoplasmic reticulum stressinduced by tunicamycin, suggesting that CCL2 regulates intracellular synthesis ofproteins and lipids and prevents activation of apoptotic pathways initiated inresponse to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Furthermore, CCL2 is involved inalleviating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in MAC-Tcells by reducing LPS-induced expression of IL8, IL6, and nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1). Collectively, CCL2 is a novel target for improving thequantity and quality of milk from cows through stimulation of proliferation onmammary epithelial cells and attenuation of LPS-induced inflammatory responses.Copyright Â© 2018 American Dairy Science Association.
