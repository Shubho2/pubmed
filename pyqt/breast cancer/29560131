The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate STAT3 andphospho-STAT3 expression on the prognosis of breast cancer patients.Materials and Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials,Embase, Web of Science, Chinese CNKI, and Wan Fang were searched up to 19th June 2017. Studies which investigated the STAT3 or phospho-STAT3 expression ofpatients with breast cancer on the basis of patient survival data or survivalcurve were eligible.Results: This meta-analysis involves 12 studies and 4513 female patients withbreast cancer. No clear relationship exists between overall survival (OS) andhigh expression of STAT3 and p-STAT3 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.95, 95% confidenceinterval [CI]: 0.62-1.46, p > 0.05). p-STAT3 expression is unrelated todisease-free survival (HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.18-2.55, p = 0.573). Notably, thepooled effect predicts better breast cancer-specific survival with p-STAT3overexpression (HR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.59-0.78, I2 = 30.9%, p < 0.001). Results of subgroup analyses show that STAT3 overexpression indicates shorter OS (HR = 1.87,95% CI: 1.42-2.45, p < 0.001) when excluding the heterogeneity test. Meanwhile,p-STAT3-positive patients have a significantly higher OS than their counterparts (HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.57-0.91, p < 0.01).Conclusions: Positive STAT3 expression may indicate poor OS. However, p-STAT3, asa potential molecular biomarker for predicting chemotherapeutic effect, appearsto have better prognostic value than STAT3.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23962 PMCID: PMC5849195PMID: 29560131
