[Epub ahead of print]Umbelliprenin shows antitumor, antiangiogenesis, antimetastatic,anti-inflammatory, and immunostimulatory activities in 4T1 tumor-bearing Balb/cmice.Rashidi M(1), Khalilnezhad A(2), Amani D(2), Jamshidi H(3), Muhammadnejad A(4),Bazi A(5), Ziai SA(3).Author information: (1)Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Mazandaran University of MedicalSciences, Sari, Iran.(2)Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University ofMedical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.(3)Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.(4)Cancer Biology Research Center, Cancer Institiute of Iran, Tehran Universityof Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.(5)Clinical Research Development Unit, Zabol University of Medical Sciences,Zabol, Iran.Umbelliprenin (UMB) has shown various pharmacological properties in vitro. Weinvestigated the antineoplastic and immunostimulatory effects of UMB in 4T1mammary-tumor-bearing mice. Two-hundred microliter of UMB (12.5 mg/ml) wasintraperitoneally administrated to healthy and tumor-bearing female Balb/c micefor a period of 18 days. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 software forWindows (version 5, La Jolla, CA). UMB caused a significant decrease in tumorsize (P < 0.01). Serum interferon gamma (IFNγ) was augmented in both healthy and tumor-bearing animals (P < 0.01), and IL-4 declined in healthy animals (P < 0.01)treated with UMB. Expressions of Ki-67, VEGF, CD31, MMP2, MMP9, VCAM1, and NF-κB were significantly decreased in tumors from UMB-treated animals (P < 0.001),whereas E-Cadherin and TNFR1 expressions were markedly increased (P < 0.001). Therates of liver and lung metastases in UMB-administrated animals were smallercompared to the control. UMB can potently inhibit tumor growth, angiogenesis,metastasis, and inflammation and potentiate an antitumor immune response in vivo.However, further investigations are required to evaluate the UMB mechanisms ofaction in cancerous cells.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26814 PMID: 29797576
