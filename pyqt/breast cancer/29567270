Electronic address: hyemig@yuhs.ac.AIM: To investigate whether pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)features are associated with diagnostic accuracy of post-treatment MRI forpredicting pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NAC) in patients with breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2005 and December 2016, 221 consecutivepatients (mean age, 50 years; range, 20-81 years) who had undergone NAC, breastMRI before and after NAC, and surgery for invasive breast cancer were enrolled.Pretreatment and post-treatment MRI images were reviewed. Radiological completeresponse (rCR) was defined as the absence of both early and late enhancement onMRI after NAC. The association of pretreatment MRI features and post-treatmentMRI diagnostic accuracy was assessed by using logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Among 221 patients, 60 (27.1%) underwent pCR after NAC. The diagnosticaccuracy of post-treatment MRI was 84.2% (186/221). False-positive diagnosisoccurred in 21 cases and false-negative diagnosis occurred in 14 cases. Ofpretreatment features, the presence of peritumoural oedema (odds ratio, 3; 95%confidence interval [CI]: 1.1, 8.0; p=0.03) and HER2 (human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2)-positive status (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% CI: 1.2, 9.9; p=0.02)were significantly associated with false-positive MRI results. Densefibroglandular tissue (odds ratio, 10.8; 95% CI: 1.1, 105.2; p=0.04), presence ofrim enhancement (odds ratio, 7.5; 95% CI: 1.2, 38.3; p=0.02) and oestrogenreceptor (ER)-positive status (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% CI: 1.2, 32.5; p=0.03) weresignificantly associated with false-negative MRI results.CONCLUSION: Pretreatment MRI features and cancer subtypes may be associated with diagnostic accuracy of post-treatment MRI after NAC in patients with breastcancer.Copyright Â© 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
