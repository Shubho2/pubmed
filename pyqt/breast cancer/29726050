Improvements in early detection and treatment have resulted in improved survival rates; however, the continuation of unhealthy behaviours after diagnosis can increase the risk ofsecond primary tumours. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness oftwo nurse-led health education interventions aiming at improving dietarybehaviours among women diagnosed with breast cancer. Participants (n = 492) were included in a double-blind randomized controlled trial with three arms: a controlgroup received usual care; women in the first intervention group received abooklet containing dietary advice; women in the second intervention groupreceived the same booklet plus a tailored telephone intervention delivered by atrained nurse. One year after the intervention, women in both intervention groupswere more likely to adhere to the recommendation of decreasing the consumption ofanimal fats compared with the control group (OR:5.0; 95% CI:1.5-16.9 and OR:6.6; 95% CI:2.0-22.6, respectively). Moreover, compared with the control group, theadjusted probability of eating the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables washigher in the second intervention group (OR:2.7; 95% CI:1.4-5.3). In summary, thebooklet containing dietary advice for breast cancer survivors, either alone orsupplemented with a nurse-led telephone intervention, was effective in promoting adherence to diet recommendations.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ecc.12854 PMID: 29726050
