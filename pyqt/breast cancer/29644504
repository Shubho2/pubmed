This is a secondary analysis of patient-level data of 1242 breast cancerpatients referred for adjuvant chemotherapy in the BCIRG005 clinical trial.Overall survival was assessed according to smoking history through Kaplan-Meieranalysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses of factorsaffecting overall and relapse-free survival were subsequently conducted. Factors that were evaluated included: age, performance status, number of chemotherapycycles, T stage, lymph node ratio, estrogen receptor status, adjuvantradiotherapy and smoking history. Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survivalaccording to smoking status (ever smoker vs. never smoker) was conducted. Therewas a trend toward a better overall survival among never smokers compared to eversmokers; however, it was not statistically significant (P = 0.098). The followingfactors were associated with better overall survival in multivariate analysis:older age (P = 0.011), complete chemotherapy course (P = 0.002), lower T stage(P < 0.0001), lower lymph node ratio (P < 0.0001) and positive estrogen receptor status (P = 0.006). Otherwise, the following factors were associated with better relapse-free survival in multivariate analysis: older age (P = 0.001), neversmoking status (P = 0.021), lower T stage (P = 0.028), lower lymph node ratio(P < 0.0001) and positive estrogen receptor status (P < 0.0001). Early-stagebreast cancer patients with a positive smoking history experienced worserelapse-free survival compared to never smokers. Physicians managing breastcancer patients should prioritize discussion about the benefits of smokingcessation when counseling their patients.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1129-0 PMID: 29644504
