In this work, monomethyl poly(ethyleneglycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) copolymer was synthesized and used toencapsulate GA by a facile one-step solid dispersion and form nano-sized micelles(GA micelles). The GA micelles exhibited small average particle size (29±2 nm),high encapsulation efficiency (92.1±0.3%), and long drug release time-in vitro.Compared to free GA, GA micelles showed superior aqueous dispersity, better tumorcellular uptake, enhanced cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction effect againstMCF-7 cells. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrated that GA micelles havebetter antitumor effect in the MCF-7 subcutaneous xenograft tumor model.Histopathological analysis of Ki-67 and TUNEL staining further proved that GAmicelles could significantly suppress proliferation as well as increase theapoptosis of tumor cells. These results suggested that GA micelles couldpotentially improve therapeutic outcomes for breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1166/jbn.2018.2626 PMID: 30041717
