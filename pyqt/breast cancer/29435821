The present study was intended to investigate theantiproliferative and chemotherapeutic potentials of 78DC (20, 40, and 80 mg/kgBW) against DMBA (20 mg in olive oil)-induced mammary carcinoma Sprague-Dawleyrats. We established the in silico approach for evaluation of the effect of 78DC on hormonal (estrogen receptor-α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR)), growthfactor receptors (EGFR and IGFR), 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1(17β-HD1), and aromatase. Effect of 78DC on estrogen synthesis, tumor growth,proliferation markers (Ki-67 and PCNA), cytokines (IL-10, IL-1β, IL-12),chemokine (MCP-1), and cellular expressions of ERα, PR, EGFR, IGF1R, p-MAPK1/2,p-JNK1/2, p-Akt, 17β-HD1, and aromatase was evaluated in mammary carcinomabearing SD rats. DMBA induces large tumor burden and histological alterations in mammary gland with a subsequent increase in ERα, PR, EGFR, IGF1R, Ki-67,proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA ), cytokines, and chemokine expressions.This was also correlated with the changes in rapid cell differentiation andproliferation. In contrast, 78DC treatment to the cancer-bearing animalsabbreviated these changes and revealed to possess antitumorigenic andantiproliferative potentials. Further, a significant decrease in expressions ofERα, PR, EGFR, IGFR, p-MAPK1/2, p-JNK1/2, p-Akt, 17β-HD1, and aromatase signifiesa reduction in estrogen sensitivity and secondary signaling pathways that maycontribute to the prevention of tumor growth. The current findings revealed that 78DC potentially reduce cancer cell proliferation and reverted mammarycancer-induced changes in experimental animals in a dose-dependent manner.DOI: 10.1007/s13105-018-0608-2 PMID: 29435821
