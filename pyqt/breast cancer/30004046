In head-and-neck cancers, varied expression is documented andtherefore its prognostic role is debatable.Aim of the Study: To find the rate of overexpression of HER2/neu in head-and-neckcancers and to understand its prognostic role by evaluating its association with nodal stage and overall stage of the patient.Methodology: A total of 70 surgically resected cases of head-and-neck cancerswere evaluated for expression of HER2/neu by immunohistochemistry. Scoring wasdone according to the American Society of Clinical Oncologists/College ofAmerican Pathologistsguidelines for Her2/neu testing in breast cancer.Results: Of the 70 cases studied, 57 were of oral cavity and 13 were laryngealsquamous cell cancers and 14 (20%) were Her2/neu positive. On correlating theexpression of HER2/neu in T1/T2 (41 cases) versus T3/T4 (27 cases), the P valuewas found to be 0.8273 which was statistically insignificant. Furthermore, nostatistically significant difference in expression of HER2/neu was found inbetween node negative and node positive cases (49 vs. 19 cases, respectively),with P = 0.512.Conclusion: In the current settings, HER2/neu is not found to be a prognosticmarker in head-and-neck cancers. Standard immunohistochemistry staining protocolsneed to be established like in breast cancers to aid uniform reporting andfurther evaluate the role of this important protooncogene in head-and-neckcancers.DOI: 10.4103/0377-4929.236599 PMID: 30004046
