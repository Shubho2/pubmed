Conventional chemotherapeutics are generally able to shrink the tumor mass, but often fail to completely eradicate cancer stem-like cells(CSCs) that are responsible for high risk of relapse and frequent metastases. In this study, we examined thermal sensibility of CSCs, developed an approach thatenabled concurrent elimination of both the bulk of cancer cells and CSCs, andinvestigated the underlying mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We designed a platform consisting of goldnanoparticle-coated porous silicon microparticle (AuPSM) that was also loadedwith docetaxel micelles (mDTX) to enable concurrent killing of the bulk of cancercells by released mDTX and CSCs by mild hyperthermia upon stimulation of AuPSMwith near infrared. In addition, we examined the role of heat shock proteins insensitizing CSC killing. Finally, we applied mDTX-loaded AuPSM to treat mice withSUM159 and 4T1 orthotopic tumors, and evaluated tumor growth and tumormetastasis.RESULTS: MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells treated with mDTX-loaded AuPSM and mildhyperthermia displayed significantly reduced efficiencies in mammosphereformation than those treated with mDTX alone or mild hyperthermia alone.Combination treatment also completely inhibited SUM159 orthotopic tumor growthand 4T1 tumor metastasis. Mechanistically, DTX treatment suppressed expression ofheat shock protein 27 in cancer cells including the CSCs, rendering cellssensitive to mild hyperthermia.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that chemotherapy sensitizes CSC to mildhyperthermia. We have developed an effective therapeutic approach to eliminatetherapy-resistant cells in TNBC.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-3872 PMID: 29921732
