The development involved theloading of DTX to nanocochleates (DTX-NC) through conversion ofdimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol-sodium (DMPG-Na) and cholesterol bearing liposomeon addition of calcium ions, followed by encapsulated DTX-NC with BI-CHI(BI-CHI-DTX- NC) and compared with DTX and DTX-NC. The release of DTX indicatedstrong pH dependence and implies strong hydrogen-bonding between nanocochleatesand DTX. Formulated BI-CHI-DTX-NC demonstrated higher in-vitro anticanceractivity in biotin over expressed human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The targeting effect for the BI-CHI-DTX-NC was also demonstrated. The concentration of the drugneeded for growth inhibition of 50% of cells in a designed time period (GI50) was1.8 μg/ml for free DTX while it was decreased by 33.34% for the DTX-NC(1.2 μg/ml). Furthermore, the GI50 value of BI-CHI-DTX-NC was 0.2 μg/ml, i.e. an 88.89% decrease was observed as compared to DTX solution. Moreover,bioavailability of DTX from BI-CHI-DTX-NC was increased by 10-folds with longercirculation time and slower plasma elimination with low tissue distribution ascompared to DTX solution. The results indicate that the BI-CHI-DTX- NC has thepotential to be applied for targeting anticancer drug delivery.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1453831 PMID: 29575931
