No national studies to-date have evaluated theuse of screening mammography among US long-stay nursing home residents. Thiscross-sectional study was designed to identify prevalence, predictors, andgeographic variation of screening mammography among that population in thecontext of current US guidelines.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Screening mammography prevalence, identified withPhysician/Supplier Part B claims and stratified by guideline age classification(65-74, ≥75 years), was estimated for all women aged ≥65 years residing in USMedicare- and Medicaid- certified nursing homes (≥1 year) with an annual Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 assessment, continuous Medicare Part B enrollment, and noclinical indication for screening mammography as of 2011 (n = 389,821). Theassociations between resident- and regional- level factors, and screeningmammography, were estimated by crude and adjusted prevalence ratios from robustPoisson regressions clustered by facility.RESULTS: Women on average were 85.4 (standard deviation ±8.1) years old, 77.9%were disabled, and 76.3% cognitively impaired. Screening mammography prevalencewas 7.1% among those aged 65-74 years (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 6.8%-7.3%)and 1.7% among those ≥75 years (95% CI, 1.7%-1.8%), with geographic variationobserved. Predictors of screening in both age groups included race, cognitiveimpairment, frailty, hospice, and some comorbidities.CONCLUSIONS: These results shed light on the current screening mammographypractices in US nursing homes. Thoughtful consideration about individualscreening recommendations and the implementation of more clear guidelines forthis special population are warranted to prevent overscreening.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
