[Epubahead of print]Change in microcalcifications on mammography after neoadjuvant chemotherapy inbreast cancer patients: correlation with tumor response grade and comparison withlesion extent.Yim H(1), Ha T(2), Kang DK(2), Park SY(2), Jung Y(3), Kim TH(2).Author information: (1)1 Department of Pathology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Gyeonggi-do,Republic of Korea.(2)2 Department of Radiology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Gyeonggi-do,Republic of Korea.(3)3 Department of Surgery, Ajou University School of Medicine, Gyeonggi-do,Republic of Korea.Background After neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), persistent microcalcificationsare often observed in spite of a decrease in the primary tumor size. Purpose Toanalyze the changes in microcalcifications after NAC and to evaluate the accuracyof residual microcalcifications in predicting the extent of residual cancer.Material and Methods Eighty patients who received NAC and underwent bothmammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after the completion of NAC were included. The location of microcalcifications was classified into twotypes: inside the mass and outside the mass. Results The extent of the residualcalcifications was larger than the pathologic residual lesion in 14 (74%) of 19patients with complete response (CR) on MRI, but the discrepancy was <1 cm ineight (42%) patients. The median value of the discrepancy was significantlyhigher in patients showing CR with outside calcifications compared to CR withinside calcifications (2.0 cm vs. 0.7 cm, P = 0.008). After NAC, the decrease of calcifications was more frequently observed in cancers showing CR on MRI orMiller-Payne grade 5 and the increase of calcifications more frequently occurred in cancers showing progress disease on MRI or Miller-Payne grade 1 ( P < 0.001and P = 0.044). Conclusion The change in microcalcifications after NAC wascorrelated with the tumor response to NAC. The discrepancy was highest in thegroup showing CR on MRI with outside calcifications. In tumors with insidecalcifications, the discrepancy was relatively low within an acceptable range.DOI: 10.1177/0284185118776491 PMID: 29764199
