Convolutionalneural network (CNN) is the most popular representation learning method forcomputer vision tasks, which have been successfully applied in digital pathology,including tumor and mitosis detection. However, CNNs are typically only tenablewith relatively small image sizes (200 × 200 pixels). Only recently, Fullyconvolutional networks (FCN) are able to deal with larger image sizes (500 × 500 pixels) for semantic segmentation. Hence, the direct application of CNNs to WSIis not computationally feasible because for a WSI, a CNN would require billionsor trillions of parameters. To alleviate this issue, this paper presents a novel method, High-throughput Adaptive Sampling for whole-slide Histopathology Imageanalysis (HASHI), which involves: i) a new efficient adaptive sampling methodbased on probability gradient and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling, and, ii) a powerfulrepresentation learning classifier based on CNNs. We applied HASHI to automateddetection of invasive breast cancer on WSI. HASHI was trained and validated usingthree different data cohorts involving near 500 cases and then independentlytested on 195 studies from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The results show that (1) theadaptive sampling method is an effective strategy to deal with WSI withoutcompromising prediction accuracy by obtaining comparative results of a densesampling (∼6 million of samples in 24 hours) with far fewer samples (∼2,000samples in 1 minute), and (2) on an independent test dataset, HASHI is effective and robust to data from multiple sites, scanners, and platforms, achieving anaverage Dice coefficient of 76%.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196828 PMCID: PMC5967747PMID: 29795581  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
