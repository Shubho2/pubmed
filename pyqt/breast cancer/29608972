In the past, many surgical procedures were routinely performed without a rigorous evaluation of the risk-benefit. To highlight the complexity ofdeveloping randomized surgical trials, disquisitions on methodology presented in the medical literature. This is particularly true when we consider breastreconstruction after surgical treatment for breast cancer. It is illusory toperform and conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) when a surgical procedureis routinely used by most surgeons.METHODS: As a case study, we present the scientific rationale and the design ofthe MAPAM01 trial which evaluates the security of the nipple sparing mastectomy. Other alternative approaches, such as propensity score and CUSUM, are presented.RESULTS: In this situation, to design surgical trials using alternativemethodological approaches present a particularly important challenge both forsurgeons and methodologists. Alternative approach to randomized trials can beuseful to evaluate surgical procedures routinely used.CONCLUSION: Close collaboration between surgeons and methodologists is needed to propose appropriate and well-designed surgical trials.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
