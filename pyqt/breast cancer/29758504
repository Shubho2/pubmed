Semi-structured interviews were conductedwith forty-six women who were either considering BPM or had already undergone thesurgery.RESULTS: Three themes identified barriers to accessing information; difficulties accessing information, inconsistent information and clinical focus/medicalizedinformation. A fourth theme - preferences of information and support needs,identified three subthemes; these were, psychological support, clearly definedprocesses and photos of mastectomies/reconstruction surgeries.CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to accessing information appeared to be widespread. A lack of integrated services contributed to inconsistent information, and medicalizedterminology/clinical focus of consultations further complicated understanding.Preferences for information include clearly defined processes, so women know the pathways after confirmation of familial BC risk. Clinical implications include a multidisciplinary team approach, and a protocol that reflects current practice.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
