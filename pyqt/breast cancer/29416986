Despite theincreased toxicity, treatment intensification with polychemotherapy improvesresponse and might be of interest in patients presenting with large primaries. Inthis trial, we aimed at exploring the efficacy and tolerability of the additionof cisplatin to standard anthracycline-cyclophosphamide backbone in patients withstage IIB/III TNBC.Patients and methods: This is a single arm, single center, non-randomized, phase II trial of stage IIB/III TNBC. Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy withcisplatin (50 mg/m2) in combination with doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) andcyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) every 21 days and for a total of six cycles (CAP).After surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel (75 mg/m2) every21 days was further provided for four cycles. Primary outcome was pathologicalcomplete response in the breast and axilla (pCR; ypT0ypN0). Secondary outcomeswere safety, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS).Results: Eight (19.5%) out of 41 patients reached a pCR and 35 (85.4%) had aclinical complete or partial response. After a median follow-up of 47.4 months(interquartile range 30.9-61.9), the proportion of patients free of recurrence ordeath at 3 years was of 51.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 34.6-66.5%], whilethe proportion of patients alive at 3 years was of 55.5% (95% CI 37.8-70.1%).Patients with a pCR rate or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer showeda numerical but statistically non-significant trend for improved DFS and OS. The majority of patients received six cycles of CAP (82.9%). The three most commongrade ≥3 adverse events were nausea (16.3%), vomiting (14.0%), and neutropenia(9.3%). Febrile neutropenia occurred in three patients (7.0%).Conclusion: Cisplatin in association with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide wasassociated with a pCR rate of 19.5% in a cohort of patients with predominantlystage III tumors. The tolerability profile of this combination poses clinicalchallenges to its general use in clinical practice.Unique Identifier Number: GBECAM 2008/02.NCT Identifier Number: NCT03304756.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2017.00329 PMCID: PMC5787778PMID: 29416986
