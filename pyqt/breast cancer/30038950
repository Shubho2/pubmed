Method: Through thePopulation Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE), 1,830 Chinese older women self-reported history of cancer screening, presence of women's cancers, and TCMuse according to type. Analyses were performed using multivariate regressionmodels. Results: Chinese older women who underwent breast cancer screening aremore likely to use herbal TCM (rate ratio [RR] = 1.15, 95% confidence interval[CI] = [1.03, 1.29]), acupuncture (RR = 1.62, CI = [1.21, 2.15]), massage therapy(RR = 2.05, CI = [1.46, 2.88]), and tai chi (RR = 1.86, CI = [1.28, 2.69]). Thosewho had cervical cancer screening are more likely to use herbal TCM (RR = 1.32,CI = [1.17, 1.48]), acupuncture (RR = 1.66, CI = [1.27, 2.18]), massage therapy(RR = 1.61, CI = [1.17, 2.21]), tai chi (RR = 1.69, CI = [1.19, 2.40]), and otherforms of TCM (RR = 1.36, CI = [1.04, 1.79]). Those with cervical cancer are less likely to use herbal TCM (RR = 0.42, CI = [0.19, 0.93]). Conclusion: Contrary to previous studies, our results suggest that U.S. Chinese older women who haveengaged in cancer screening use TCM while those with self-reported cancer did notuse TCM at a higher rate. This warrants further research on TCM utilization toidentify reasons of use in this population and encourage patient-centered care.DOI: 10.1177/2333721418778199 PMCID: PMC6050798PMID: 30038950
