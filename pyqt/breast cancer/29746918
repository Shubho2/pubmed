Inspite of promising new therapies, many patients develop resistance andprogression. The aim of this pilot study was to determine if circulating tumorcells (CTCs) are associated with shortened (180-day) progression-free survival(PFS) after a baseline CTC assessment in stage IV melanoma patients.STUDY DESIGN: A baseline CTC assessment was performed in 93 stage IV melanomapatients using a commercially available immunomagnetic system. The presence of 1 or more CTC was considered a positive result. A Cox multivariable regressionmodel was used to evaluate the association between presence of CTCs at baselineand PFS, after adjusting for covariables. Kaplan-Meier curves and a log-rank testwere used to summarize and compare unadjusted PFS for patients stratified by CTC positivity.RESULTS: Median follow-up was 17 months; mean age was 55 years. Thirteen of 93(14%) patients had no evidence of disease (NED) at baseline CTC assessment. Oneor more CTC was detected in 39 of 93 (42%) of patients at baseline; CTCs were notassociated with primary melanoma features or NED status. Twenty-eight of 93 (30%)patients progressed within 180 days of baseline draw, with 20 of 39 (51%) of the CTC-positive patients relapsing compared with 8 of 54 (15%) of the CTC-negativepatients. In adjusted Cox models, a significant association was found suggesting worse PFS within 180 days for CTC-positive patients at baseline (vs CTC-negative)(hazard ratio 4.69, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.77, p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS: One or more CTCs at baseline were associated with progression within180 days in stage IV melanoma patients. This information warrants further studyof CTCs as a means of identifying patients at high-risk for disease progression.Copyright © 2018 American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
