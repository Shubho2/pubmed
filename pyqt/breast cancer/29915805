These tumors differ in histology, as well as primary sites from whichthey arise. Risk factors associated with the occurrence of MPTs include germline alterations, exposure to prior cancer therapies, occupational hazards, andlifestyle and behavioral influences.Case report: We present a case of a patient who was diagnosed with fourmetachronous primary tumors. In 2013, she was diagnosed with serousproliferations associated with psammomatous bodies of primary peritoneal origin(pT3NxM0). This was followed by invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast (stagepT2N0Mx, histological grade III/III) in 2014, melanoma (stage pT2bNxMx) in 2016that further advanced to the lung and brain in 2017, and a low-grade lungcarcinoid in 2017. To better understand the biology of this patient's MPTs, weperformed next-generation sequencing (NGS) to assess for both somatic andgermline alterations. The treatment course for this patient aims to target thetumor with the strongest prognostic value, namely her malignant melanoma, and hascontributed favorably to the overall survival of this patient.Conclusion: We report the clinical and genomic landscape of a patient with MPTswho had no identifiable unique somatic or germline mutations to explain herpredilection to cancer. The treatment course and overall prognosis for thispatient is important for understanding future cases with unrelated, metachronous MPTs, the occurrence of which cannot always be explained by underlying geneticmechanisms.DOI: 10.1016/j.gore.2018.04.004 PMCID: PMC6003430PMID: 29915805
