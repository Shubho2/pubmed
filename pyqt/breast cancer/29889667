Systemic HT is safe and effectivefor symptomatic menopausal women aged younger than 60 years and within 10 yearsof menopause. Special populations of early menopause, high risk for fracture,risk of breast or uterine cancer, and extended duration are discussed. Withlonger duration of use, periodic evaluation and reassessment of health risks are needed. Lowered doses, transdermal therapies or newer options may enhance thebenefit:risk ratio for HT.DOI: 10.1097/GRF.0000000000000383 PMID: 29889667
