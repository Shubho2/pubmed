However, other studies have suggested that, under some circumstances,the AHR can oppose tumor aggression. Resolving this apparent contradiction iscritical to the design of AHR-targeted cancer therapeutics. Molecular (siRNA,shRNA, AHR repressor, CRISPR-Cas9) and pharmacological (AHR inhibitors)approaches were used to confirm the hypothesis that AHR inhibition reduces human cancer cell invasion (irregular colony growth in 3D Matrigel cultures and Boyden chambers), migration (scratch wound assay) and metastasis (human cancer cellxenografts in zebrafish). Furthermore, these assays were used for a head-to-head comparison between AHR antagonists and agonists. AHR inhibition orknockdown/knockout consistently reduced human ER&minus;/PR&minus;/Her2&minus; andinflammatory breast cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis. This wasassociated with a decrease in invasion-associated genes (e.g., Fibronectin,VCAM1, Thrombospondin, MMP1) and an increase in CDH1/E-cadherin, previouslyassociated with decreased tumor aggression. Paradoxically, AHR agonists(2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and/or 3,3&prime;-diindolylmethane)similarly inhibited irregular colony formation in Matrigel and blocked metastasisin vivo but accelerated migration. These data demonstrate the complexity ofmodulating AHR activity in cancer while suggesting that AHR inhibitors, and,under some circumstances, AHR agonists, may be useful as cancer therapeutics.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19051388 PMCID: PMC5983651PMID: 29735912
