[Epub ahead of print]ARHGAP42 promotes cell migration and invasion involving PI3K/Akt signalingpathway in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Hu Q(1)(2)(3), Lin X(1)(4), Ding L(1)(4), Zeng Y(1)(4), Pang D(3), Ouyang N(1),Xiang Y(5), Yao H(1)(4).Author information: (1)Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and GeneRegulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou,China.(2)Department of Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou,China.(3)Department of Breast Cancer Oncology, Foshan Hospital of Sun Yat-SenUniversity, Foshan, China.(4)Department of Breast Cancer Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital of SunYat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.(5)Department of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.Rho GTPase-activating protein 42 was identified as an inhibitor of RhoA tomaintain normal blood pressure homeostasis. However, the effect of ARHGAP42 inpromoting cell malignancy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma is demonstrated in thisstudy. Microarray and real-time quantitative PCR were used for a mRNA profilingof ARHGAP42 in nasopharyngeal primary and metastatic carcinoma tissues. Westernblot and immunohistochemical staining were used for detecting the expression ofARHGAP42 protein in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues and cell lines. Theoverexpression and silence experiments of ARHGAP42 were performed in NPC celllines using siRNA and expressive plasmid for evaluating cancer cell migration andinvasion in vitro. Real-time quantitative PCR, western blot, and transwell testwere employed for with the function of ARHGAP42 and its antisense lncRNAuc010rul. We confirmed the elevated expression of ARHGAP42 in metastatic NPCtissues of mRNA and protein for the first time. Immunohistochemical analysisindicated that NPC patients with highly ARHGAP42 expression were significantlyassociated with shorter metastasis-free survival. Knockdown of ARHGAP42 resulted in significant inhibition of nasopharyngeal cancer cell migration and invasion invitro, and the overexpression of ARHGAP42 showed the opposite effects. Inaddition, the silence of uc010rul resulted in ARHGAP42 expression decrease andsignificant inhibition of nasopharyngeal cancer cell migration and invasion. Highexpression of ARHGAP42 is associated with poor metastasis-free survival ofnasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. ARHGAP42 promotes migration and invasion ofnasopharyngeal carcinoma cells in vitro; the antisense lncRNA may be involved in this effect.Â© 2018 The Authors.
