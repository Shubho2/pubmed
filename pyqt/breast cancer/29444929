Furthermore, it is unclear whether these models could be improved.Experimental Design: Adataset of 5,729 women was used for model development. A Bayesian variableselection algorithm was implemented to stochastically search for importantinteraction terms among the predictors. The derived models were then compared in three independent datasets (n = 5,534). We examined calibration, discrimination, and performed decision curve analysis.Results: CancerMath demonstrated worsecalibration performance compared with PREDICT in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative tumors. The decline in discrimination performance was -4.27%(-6.39 to -2.03) and -3.21% (-5.9 to -0.48) for ER-positive and ER-negativetumors, respectively. Our new models matched the performance of PREDICT in terms of calibration and discrimination, but offered no improvement. Decision curveanalysis showed predictions for all models were clinically useful for treatmentdecisions made at risk thresholds between 5% and 55% for ER-positive tumors andat thresholds of 15% to 60% for ER-negative tumors. Within these thresholdranges, CancerMath provided the lowest clinical utility among all themodels.Conclusions: Survival probabilities from PREDICT offer both improvedaccuracy and discrimination over CancerMath. Using PREDICT to make treatmentdecisions offers greater clinical utility than CancerMath over a range of riskthresholds. Our new models performed as well as PREDICT, but no better,suggesting that, in this setting, including further interaction terms offers nopredictive benefit.
