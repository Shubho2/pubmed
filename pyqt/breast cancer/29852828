BALB/c mice were injected with4T1 breast cancer cell suspension. The test group was treated with VD reagent.The survival and tumor size of mice were observed. The proliferation of 4T1 invitro was detected by MTS analysis. The changes of immune parameters andmicroenvironment in mice were evaluated by flow cytometry and real-time RT-PCR.Our results demonstrate that VD administration caused a decline in survival time and raising the volume of tumor, the decreasing numbers of CD3+CD4+ T, CD3+CD8+ Tand CD4+T-bet+IFN-γ+ Th1 cells and transcriptions of T-bet and IFN-γ, anincreasing number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and transcription of TGF-β.Our data suggest that the routine clinical application of any strategiestargeting VD status for breast cancer therapy is deserved serious consideration.DOI: 10.2217/imt-2017-0131 PMID: 29852828
