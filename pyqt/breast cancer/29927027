One radiation oncologist contoured the breastPTV, heart, left ventricle (LV), and left anterior descending artery (LAD).Treatment plans were optimized using field-in-field technique with the AAAalgorithm. Each plan was optimized to provide identical coverage to the PTV such that a reasonable comparison for OAR dosimetry could be evaluated. All plans wereprescribed 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions to the left-breast PTV.RESULTS: The mean dose in SFB for the heart, LV, and LAD was 1.92, 3.19, and21.73 Gy, respectively, which were significantly higher than the mean dose inSDIBH for the heart (1.08 Gy, P ≤ 0.0001), LV (1.50 Gy, P ≤ 0.0001), and LAD(6.3 Gy, P ≤ 0.0001) and in PFB for the heart (0.98 Gy, P ≤ 0.0001), LV (1.34 Gy,P ≤ 0.0001), and LAD (6.57 Gy, P ≤ 0.0001). Similar findings were noted for thecardiac components in SFB for V2.5, V5, V10, V20, and V30 compared with values inSDIBH and PFB. The mean dose for the left lung in PFB was 0.61 Gy that wassignificantly lower than in SFB (5.63 Gy, P ≤ 0.0001) and SDIBH (5.54 Gy,P ≤ 0.0001). Mean dose and dosimetric values for each OAR increased in SFB andSDIBH for patients with a large breast volume compared with values for patientswith a small breast volume.CONCLUSIONS: SFB results in higher heart, LAD, and LV doses than the othertechniques. Both PFB and SDIBH are more advantageous for these OARs irrespective of breast volume. PFB results in significantly lower lung doses than SFB andSDIBH. PFB always provided better results than SFB for the heart, LV, LAD, andlung. This conclusion contrasts with some published studies concluding that theprone position has no benefit for heart sparing.© 2018 The Authors.
