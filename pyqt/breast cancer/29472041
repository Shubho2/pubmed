To standardise practice and improve outcomes forpatients, the British professional associations developed best-practiceguidelines with specific guidance for newer mesh-assisted implant-basedtechniques. We explored the degree of uptake of best-practice guidelines withinunits performing implant-based reconstruction (IBBR) as the first phase of theimplant Breast Reconstruction Evaluation (iBRA) study.METHODS: A questionnaire developed by the iBRA Steering Group was completed bytrainee and consultant leads at breast and plastic surgical units across the UK. Simple summary statistics were calculated for each survey item to assesscompliance with current best-practice guidelines.RESULTS: 81 units from 79 NHS Trusts completed the questionnaire. Markedvariation was observed in adherence to guidelines, especially those relating toclinical governance and infection prevention strategies. Less than half (n = 28, 47%) of units obtained local clinical governance board approval prior to offeringnew mesh-based techniques and prospective audit of the clinical, cosmetic andpatient-reported outcomes of surgery was infrequent. Most units screened formethicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus prior to surgery but fewer than 1 in 3 screened for methicillin-sensitive strains. Laminar-flow theatres (recommended for IBBR) were not widely-available with less than 1 in 5 units having regularaccess. Peri-operative antibiotics were widely-used, but the type and durationwere highly-variable.CONCLUSIONS: The iBRA national practice questionnaire has demonstrated variation in reported practice and adherence to IBBR guidelines. High-quality evidence isurgently required to inform best practice.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..
