Epub 2018 Apr 24.Assessment of HER2 status in breast cancer biopsies is not affected byaccelerated tissue processing.Bulte JP(1), Halilovic A(2), Kalkman S(3), van Cleef PHJ(2), van Diest PJ(3),Strobbe LJA(4), de Wilt JHW(1), Bult P(2).Author information: (1)Department of General Surgery, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen,the Netherlands.(2)Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, theNetherlands.(3)Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, theNetherlands.(4)Department of Surgical Oncology, Canisius-Wilhelmina Hospital, Nijmegen, theNetherlands.AIMS: To establish whether core needle biopsy (CNB) specimens processed with anaccelerated processing method with short fixation time can be used to determineaccurately the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status of breastcancer.METHODS AND RESULTS: A consecutive case-series from two high-volume breastclinics was created. We compared routine HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC)assessment between accelerated processing CNB specimens and routinely processedpostoperative excision specimens. Additional amplification-based testing wasperformed in cases with equivocal results. The formalin fixation time was lessthan 2 h and between 6 and 72 h, respectively. Fluorescence in-situ hybridisationand multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were used for amplification testing. One hundred and forty-four cases were included, 15 of which wereHER2-positive on the routinely processed excision specimens. On the CNBspecimens, 44 were equivocal on IHC and required an amplification-based test.Correlation between the CNB specimens and the corresponding excision specimenswas high for final HER2 status, with an accuracy of 97% and a kappa of 0.85.CONCLUSIONS: HER2 status can be determined reliably on CNB specimens withaccelerated processing time using standard clinical testing methods. Using thisaccelerated technology the minimum 6 h of formalin fixation, which currentguidelines consider necessary, can be decreased safely. This allows for acomplete and expedited histology-based diagnosis of breast lesions in the settingof a one-stop-shop, same-day breast clinic.Â© 2018 The Authors.
