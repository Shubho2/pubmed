China.Vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) serves a key role in adjusting and maintaining the intracellular pH, as well as in regulating the drug resistance of tumor cells. Inrecent years, the expression level of V-ATPase has been considered to be able to predict the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs. Cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) is known to serve a key role in the development andprogression of breast cancer. The present study aimed to identify the role CD147 and V-ATPase in chemoresistance in breast cancer, and to characterize theregulation of CD147 on V-ATPase. Firstly, the expression levels of CD147 andV-ATPase were detected in chemotherapy-resistance breast cancer samples. It wasdemonstrated that V-ATPase was highly expressed in chemotherapy-resistance breastcancer samples, and that its expression was correlated with CD147 expression.Subsequently, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were used to study the regulatory effectof CD147 on the expression and function of V-ATPase. Gene transfection or smallinterfering RNA transfection were used to control the expression of CD147 in the two cell lines. The results revealed that the overexpression of CD147 increasedthe expression of V-ATPase in MCF-7 cells, whereas CD147 knockdown decreasedV-ATPase expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. It was also observed that CD147 affectedthe V-ATPase activity, regulating the transmembrane pH gradient of cancer cells. These results demonstrated that CD147 was associated with the sensitivity ofchemotherapeutic drugs of epirubicin and docetaxel, while pantoprazole was ableto partially reverse the CD147-mediated chemoresistance in breast cancer.Therefore, the current study provided a possible mechanism for furtherexamination of drug resistance in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8199 PMCID: PMC5921221PMID: 29731886
