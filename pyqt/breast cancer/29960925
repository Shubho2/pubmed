This subgroupof cancer patients may thus postpone relevant healthcare seeking.AIM: We aimed to investigate the rates of daytime face-to-face consultations ingeneral practice before a cancer diagnosis in patients with different categories of 'usual' consultation frequency.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based comparative study usingregister data on all 123,934 first-time cancer patients aged 50-90 years who werediagnosed in 2009-2013 in Denmark. Usual consultation rates were based on number of consultations from 19 to 36 months before cancer diagnosis. We predicted themarginal monthly consultation rates for up to 18 months before diagnosis. Thesewere based on the estimated (mean) rates of consultations with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were calculated by negative binomial regressionanalysis with robust variance estimation.RESULTS: Patients with cancer began to increase their consultation frequency fourto six months before their cancer diagnosis. The average monthly consultationrates varied slightly across usual consultation groups; rates were lowest amongmale 'frequent' consulters (0.28 (95% CI: 0.27;0.29)) and highest among female'frequent' consulters (0.35 (95% CI: 0.34;0.37)). The additional number ofconsultations was 1-2 for all combinations of usual consultation frequency, sex, and cancer type (except for female breast cancer and 'average' consulters withlung or prostate cancer).CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer begin to increase their consultation frequencyin general practice before a cancer diagnosis independently of their usualconsultation frequency.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
