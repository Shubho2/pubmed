This study aimed to identify key methylation sites inluminal breast cancer, as well as precise molecular tools for predictingprognosis.METHODS: We compared methylation levels of normal and luminal breast cancersamples from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. The relationships amongdifferentially methylated sites, corresponding mRNA expression levels andprognosis were further analysed. Differentially expressed genes in normal andcancerous samples were analysed, followed by the identification of prognosticsignature genes. Samples were divided into low- and high-risk groups based on thesignature genes. Prognoses of low- and high-risk groups were compared. The GeneExpression Omnibus dataset were used to validate signature genes for prognosisprediction. Prognosis of low- and high-risk groups in Luminal A and Luminal Bsamples from the TCGA and the Metabric cohort dataset were analyzed. We alsoanalysed the correlation between clinical features of low- and high- risk groups as well as their differences in gene expression.RESULTS: Fourteen methylation sites were considered to be related to luminalbreast cancer prognosis because their methylation levels, mRNA expression andprognoses were closely related to each other. The methylation level of SOSTDC1was used to divide samples into hypo- and hyper-methylation groups. We alsoidentified an mRNA signature, comprising eight transcripts, ESCO2, PACSIN1,CDCA2, PIGR, PTN, RGMA, KLK4 and CENPA, which was used to divide samples intolow- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group showed significantly betterprognosis than the high-risk group. A correlation analysis revealed that the riskscore was an independent prognostic factor. Low- and high- risk groupssignificantly correlated with the survival ratio in Luminal A samples, but not inLuminal B samples on the basis of the TCGA and the Metabric cohort dataset.Further functional annotation demonstrated that the differentially expressedgenes were mainly involved in cell cycle and cancer progression.CONCLUSIONS: We identified several key methylation sites and an mRNA signaturefor predicting luminal breast cancer prognosis. The signature exhibited effectiveand precise prediction of prognosis and may serve as a prognostic and diagnostic marker for luminal breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4314-9 PMCID: PMC5896050PMID: 29642861
