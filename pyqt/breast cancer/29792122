The aim was to quantify this potential drugcost avoidance. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study of thedrug cost avoidance during the study period (2014-2016). We included clinicaltrials with investigational drug, managed by pharmacy department and provided by the sponsor. The patients included had a therapeutic alternative defined asstandard treatment that should have been received in case of not participating inthe clinical trial. Direct cost savings, to national healthcare system,associated to clinical trials were calculated. Results Thirty-seven clinicaltrials with a total of 89 breast cancer patients were included in the study. Atotal of 62.2% were phase III and 75.7% belonged to the pharmaceutical industry. They provided a total cost avoidance of 957,246€ (1,130,028$), an average costavoidance per patient of 10,756€ (12,697$). Conclusions Our study suggests thatthose clinical trials in which investigational drug are provided or refunded bythe sponsor provide substantial cost savings. Due to the shortage of publishedarticles that calculate the cost avoided in medication, we cannot comparedirectly the results obtained in the different institutions.DOI: 10.1177/1078155218775193 PMID: 29792122
