We searched the following databases:MEDLINE/In-Process, Web of Science, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CENTRAL, CDSR, CINAHL,PsycINFO and PsycARTICLES from database inception to 23 January 2018. The review included studies on the cultural, social, structural and behavioural factors thatinfluence asymptomatic breast and cervical cancer screening attendance andcervical smear testing (Papanicolaou test) in South Asian populations and thosepublished in the English language. The framework analysis method was used andthemes were drawn out following the thematic analysis method.SETTINGS: Asymptomatic breast or cervical screening.PARTICIPANTS: South Asian women, including Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani, SriLankan, Bhutanese, Maldivian and Nepali populations.RESULTS: 51 included studies were published between 1991 and 2018. Sample sizesranged from 25 to 38 733 and participants had a mean age of 18 to 83 years. Ourreview showed that South Asian women generally had lower screening rates thanhost country women. South Asian women had poorer knowledge of cancer and cancerprevention and experienced more barriers to screening. Cultural practices andassumptions influenced understandings of cancer and prevention, emphasising theimportance of host country cultures and healthcare systems.CONCLUSIONS: High-quality research on screening attendance is required usingprospective designs, where objectively validated attendance is predicted fromcultural understandings, beliefs, norms and practices, thus informing policy ontargeting relevant public health messages to the South Asian communities aboutscreening for cancer.PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CSD 42015025284.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
