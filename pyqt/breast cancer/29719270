Manytherapeutic targets of cell signaling and cell cycle pathways have met successwith endocrine therapy and remain an ongoing area of investigation. This reviewfocuses on two major pathways that have recently emerged as importantopportunities for therapeutic intervention in endocrine resistant breast tumors: PI3K/AKT/mTOR cell signaling and cyclinD1/cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 cell cycle pathways. Additionally, we highlight individual and combination strategies incurrent clinical trials that target these pathways and others under investigationfor the treatment of ER positive breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018.
