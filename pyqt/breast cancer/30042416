[Epub ahead of print]Adam12 and lnc015192 act as ceRNAs in breast cancer by regulating miR-34a.Huang X(1), Xie X(1), Liu P(1), Yang L(1), Chen B(1), Song C(1), Tang H(2), XieX(3).Author information: (1)Department of Breast Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State KeyLaboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for CancerMedicine, 510060, Guangzhou, China.(2)Department of Breast Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State KeyLaboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for CancerMedicine, 510060, Guangzhou, China. tanghl@sysucc.org.cn.(3)Department of Breast Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State KeyLaboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for CancerMedicine, 510060, Guangzhou, China. xiexm@sysucc.org.cn.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to play vital roles in the progressof multiple cancers. However, the functions of lncRNAs in breast cancer remain tobe discovered. We performed microarrays to identify the differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in breast tissues with or without miR-34a knockout. To explore the functions of the differentially expressed mRNA and lncRNA in breast cancer,we conducted a series of experiments. We found that Adam12 and lnc015192 weresignificantly upregulated in miR-34a knockout breast tissues. Knockdown of Adam12and lnc015192 inhibited breast cancer cell migration, invasion, andepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Further experiments revealed thatlnc015192 regulated Adam12 expression by functioning as a competing endogenousRNA (ceRNA) for miR-34a. In summary, our study demonstrate that Adam12 andlnc015192 promote breast cancer metastasis partly by sponging miR-34a through theceRNA mechanism.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0410-1 PMID: 30042416
