However,the combination of oral vinorelbine and capecitabine has been demonstrated to be effective and safe in patients with advanced breast cancer pretreated withanthracycline. Furthermore, some studies assessed the activity of dasatinib, anoral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits five oncogenic tyrosine kinasefamilies, alone or in combination with different chemotherapy in patientsaffected with advanced breast cancer.Case presentation: A patient with metastatic breast cancer, hormone receptorpositive and human epidermal grow factor receptor 2 negative, pretreated withepirubicine, taxanes and nab-paclitaxel, was submitted to third line chemotherapywith vinorelbine 60 mg/m2 on day 1, 8 plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice dailyfrom day 1 to day 14 every 21 days. The patient was taking also dasatinib 100 mg once daily for chronic myeloid leukemia. The treatment was well tolerated and,after 15 months, computed tomography scan showed a complete response of livermetastases and bone stable disease. After another 28 months, a18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan showed a metabolicresponse of bone metastases without other site of disease.Conclusions: This is the first case in literature about activity of dasatinib in combination with a chemotherapy schedule of oral vinorelbine and capecitabine in advanced breast cancer. This treatment showed both good tolerability and greatactivity with a long progression free survival of 54 months.DOI: 10.1186/s40164-018-0094-9 PMCID: PMC5784669PMID: 29416938
