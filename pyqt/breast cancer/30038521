The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the treatmentgroup (n=30) which received nebivolol 5 mg once daily for the duration ofchemotherapy and the control group (n=30) without treatment with nebivolol.Cytostatic treatment was performed with doxorubicin 70 mg/m2 administeredintravenously every 21 days for six cycles. The average cumulative dose ofdoxorubicin was 520±8 mg/m2. Echocardiography was performed immediately beforeand after six cycles of doxorubicin therapy.Results: We found no significant differences between the two groups regardingbaseline clinical and echocardiographic parameters. The two groups reached asimilar cumulative dose of doxorubicin. No patient died during the study. None ofthe patients withdrew from chemotherapy. After six cycles of doxorubicin therapy,the left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, shortening fraction, and LVdiameters changed, but not significantly. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) detectedin the control group a significant decrease of myocardial velocities, indicating a LV diastolic dysfunction. In the same group, speckle tracking imaging (STI)revealed a statistically significant alteration of the ventricular deformation,which means a decrease in LV systolic function. In the nebivolol treatment group,no significant alterations in the LV systolic and diastolic function wereobserved.Conclusion: The results of this study show the benefit of new echocardiographicimaging methods such as TDI and STI in the screening of early cardiac dysfunctioninduced by cytostatic treatment. Nebivolol treatment prevented the occurrence of anthracyclines-induced cardiomyopathy in the short term. In order to confirmthese preliminary results, larger studies with a longer follow-up period arerequired.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S166481 PMCID: PMC6053261PMID: 30038521
