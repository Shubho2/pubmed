[Epub ahead of print]Interaction with SP1, but not binding to the E-box motifs, is responsible forBHLHE40/DEC1-induced transcriptional suppression of CLDN1 and cell invasion inMCF-7 cells.Zheng Q(1)(2), Wang C(1)(2), Wang L(1)(2), Zhang D(1)(2), Liu N(1)(2), Ming X(3),Zhou H(3), Guli Q(3), Liu Y(1)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, College of Basic Medical Sciences and The FirstAffiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, China.(2)Institute of Pathology and Pathophysiology, China Medical University,Shenyang, China.(3)Department of Pathology, The People's Hospital of Tacheng Region, Tacheng,China.Basic helix-loop-helix family member e40 (BHLHE40) is located in 3p26.1 and acts as a transcriptional repressor of the circadian rhythm by suppressing theexpression of the clock genes and clock-controlled genes. Recent researchindicated that BHLHE40 may be involved in regulating tumor cell progression.However the mechanism by which BHLHE40 regulates the invasion and metastasis oftumor cells is unclear. Our in vitro assays showed that BHLHE40 promoted tumorcell invasion while BHLHE40 silencing by siRNA suppressed tumor cell invasion of MCF-7 cells. BHLHE40 suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of CLDN1 CLDN4and CDH1 and promoted the expression of SNAI1 and SNAI2. Reporter assaysdemonstrated that BHLHE40 suppressed CLDN1 transcription but not through directbinding to the E-box motifs in the CLDN1 promoter. Further studies demonstratedBHLHE40 suppressed CLDN1 transcription by preventing the interaction between SP1 and a specific motif within the promoter region of CLDN1. BHLHE40 could notfurther suppress CLDN1 transactivation after SP1 siRNA transfection that is,BHLHE40-induced suppression of CLDN1 relied on SP1. Furthermore our dataindicated that SP1 was a major regulator of CLDN1 transcription by binding to aspecific motif that was located at -233 to -61 bp upstream of the transcriptionstart site. Immunoprecipitation and co-localization data revealed an interaction between BHLHE40 and SP1. By constructing deletion mutants we found that the BHLH and Orange regions are both essential for the BHLHE40-SP1 interaction. BHLHE40probably acts as an inhibitory nuclear cofactor or perhaps recruits otherinhibitory cofactors to inhibit the SP1-mediated CLDN1 transactivation. Theseresults suggest that BHLHE40 facilitates cell invasion and may be used as a noveltarget for breast cancer prevention and treatment.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/mc.22829 PMID: 29704436
