Because LBs are largely non-invasive, they are a less-costly alternative for serial analysis of tumor progression and heterogeneity to facilitate clinicalmanagement. Although a variety of tumor markers are proposed (e.g.,free-circulating DNA), the clinical evidence for Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs)is currently the most developed. Areas covered: This paper presents a healtheconomic perspective of LBs in cancer management. We first briefly introduce the requirements in biomarker development and validation, illustrated for CTCs.Second, we discuss the state-of-art on the clinical utility of LBs in breastcancer in more detail. We conclude with a future perspective on the clinical use and reimbursement of LBs Expert commentary: A significant increase in clinicalresearch on LBs can be observed and the results suggest a rapid change of cancer management. In addition to studies evaluating clinical utility of LBs, a smoothtranslation into clinical practice requires systematic assessment of the healtheconomic benefits. This paper argues that (early stage) health economic research is required to facilitate its clinical use and to prioritize further evidencedevelopment.DOI: 10.1080/14737167.2018.1505505 PMID: 30052095
