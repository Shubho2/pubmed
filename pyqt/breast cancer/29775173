The purpose of the studywas to understand the experiences of AI women who receive cancer treatment, whichis integral for eradication of AI cancer disparities among women. A qualitativedescriptive methodology was used with a sample of 43 AI women with breast,cervical, colon, and other types of cancer from the Northern Plains region ofSouth Dakota. Interviews were conducted from June 2014 to February 2015.Qualitative content analysis revealed that women experienced: (a) health concernsbeing ignored or overlooked; (b) lack of consistent and qualified providers; (c) inadequate healthcare infrastructure; (d) sub-optimal patient-healthcare providerrelationships; (e) positive experiences with healthcare providers; and (f)pressure and misinformation about treatment. Results indicate the types ofsupport AI women may need when accessing healthcare. Culturally informedtrainings for healthcare professionals may be needed to provide high-quality and sensitive care for AI women who have cancer, and to support those providersalready providing proper care.DOI: 10.1080/00981389.2018.1474837 PMID: 29775173
