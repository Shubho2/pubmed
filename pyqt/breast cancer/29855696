One mechanism which monocytes/macrophages use to kill cancercells is phagocytosis. Using trastuzumab and human breast cancer cell lines as a model, we used flow cytometry to evaluate the importance of avidity, antigendensity, Fcγ receptor (FcγR) expression, and FcγR polymorphisms in human monocytephagocytosis. By increasing avidity for the tumor through the addition ofpertuzumab to trastuzumab, there was a two-to-threefold increase in phagocytosis potency against the HCC1419 cell line compared to antibodies alone, while NKcell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) failed to increase tumor cell death. Consistent with increasing the avidity through multipleantibodies, antigen density significantly enhanced phagocytosis with breastcancer cell lines that were HER2 gene-amplified compared to non-amplified tumorcells. Confirmation that high antigen density enhanced phagocytosis was obtained when HER2 was overexpressed in HER2 non-amplified cell lines. In contrast, NKcell ADCC failed to distinguish differences in tumor cell death when comparinggene-amplified and non-amplified breast cancer cell lines. The level ofphagocytosis was influenced by FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa expression. Most monocytesare FcγRIIIa-, and the induction of the receptor significantly enhancesantibody-dependent phagocytosis. Although both receptors are involved, whenblocked FcγRIIIa had a greater influence on phagocytosis. Furthermore, thepolymorphism FcγRIIIa 158V significantly enhanced phagocytosis; whereas FcγRIIa131H polymorphism appeared to improve phagocytosis but was not statisticallysignificant. Targeting of monocytes for enhanced phagocytosis may improve theeffectiveness of therapeutic antibodies to improve clinical outcomes.DOI: 10.1007/s00262-018-2179-z PMID: 29855696
