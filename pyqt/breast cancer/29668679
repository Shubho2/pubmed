Both cancer cells and parasitesestablish a tissue microenvironment that allows for immune evasion and mayreflect functional alterations of various innate cells. Here, we investigated howthe phenotype and function of human monocytes is altered by exposure to cancercell lines and if these functional and phenotypic alterations parallel thoseinduced by exposure to helminth parasites. Thus, human monocytes were exposed to three different cancer cell lines (breast, ovarian, or glioblastoma) or to livemicrofilariae (mf) of Brugia malayi-a causative agent of lymphatic filariasis.After 2 days of co-culture, monocytes exposed to cancer cell lines showedmarkedly upregulated expression of M1-associated (TNF-α, IL-1β), M2-associated(CCL13, CD206), Mreg-associated (IL-10, TGF-β), and angiogenesis associated(MMP9, VEGF) genes. Similar to cancer cell lines, but less dramatically, mfaltered the mRNA expression of IL-1β, CCL13, TGM2 and MMP9. When surfaceexpression of the inhibitory ligands PDL1 and PDL2 was assessed, monocytesexposed to both cancer cell lines and to live mf significantly upregulated PDL1and PDL2 expression. In contrast to exposure to mf, exposure to cancer cell linesincreased the phagocytic ability of monocytes and reduced their ability to induceT cell proliferation and to expand Granzyme A+ CD8+ T cells. Our data suggestthat despite the fact that helminth parasites and cancer cell lines areextraordinarily disparate, they share the ability to alter the phenotype of humanmonocytes.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006404 PMCID: PMC5927465PMID: 29668679  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
