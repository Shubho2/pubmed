Phage display is a powerful molecular method in which peptide andprotein libraries can be displayed via genetic fusions on the surface of phages. This approach has tremendous potential for biomedical applications and hasalready facilitated the discovery of specific antibodies, specific antigens, and peptides with potential roles in the diagnosis and treatment of malignanciesincluding breast cancer. In this review, we discuss the new and the latestadvancements in the applications of the phage display technique in the provision of immune therapeutics for breast cancer.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1381612824666180327152117 PMID: 29589543
