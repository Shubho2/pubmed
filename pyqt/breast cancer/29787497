Two radiologists evaluated lesion MRI characteristics.RESULTS: The EPC presented oval or round mass with circumscribed margin on MRI.In addition, 4 cases exhibited a cystic-solid mixed mass with mural nodules, and 4 cases exhibited a liquid level that indicated the possibility of hemorrhage.CONCLUSIONS: A well-defined cystic-solid mixed mass with mural nodules, or acircumscribed mass exhibiting the possibility of hemorrhage, may suggest thediagnosis of EPC.DOI: 10.1097/RCT.0000000000000737 PMID: 29787497  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
