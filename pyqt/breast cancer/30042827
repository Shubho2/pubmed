Chan School of Public Health, Molecular and IntegrativePhysiological Sciences, Boston, MA, USA.(#)Contributed equallyThe Hippo signaling pathway is a central regulator of organ size, tissuehomeostasis, and tumorigenesis. KIBRA is a member of the WW domain-containingprotein family and has recently been reported to be an upstream protein in theHippo signaling pathway. However, the clinical significance of KIBRA deregulationand the underlying mechanisms by which KIBRA regulates breast cancer (BC)initiation and progression remain poorly understood. Here, we report that KIBRAknockdown in mammary epithelial cells induced epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition (EMT) and increased cell migration and tumorigenic potential.Mechanistically, we observed that inhibiting KIBRA induced growthfactor-independent cell proliferation in 2D and 3D culture due to the secretionof amphiregulin (AREG), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand. Also, we show that AREG activation in KIBRA-knockdown cells depended on thetranscriptional coactivator YAP1. Significantly, decreased expression of KIBRA iscorrelated with recurrence and reduced BC patient survival. In summary, thisstudy elucidates the molecular events that underpin the role of KIBRA in BC. As aresult, our work provides biological insight into the role of KIBRA as a criticalregulator of YAP1-mediated oncogenic growth, and may have clinical potential for facilitating patient stratification and identifying novel therapeutic approaches for BC patients.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25724 PMCID: PMC6057453PMID: 30042827
