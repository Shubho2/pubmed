Normal ovarian physiology is intricately connected to small GTPbinding proteins of the Ras superfamily (Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran) whichgovern processes such as signal transduction, cell proliferation, cell motility, and vesicle transport. We hypothesized that common germline variation in genesencoding small GTPases is associated with EOC risk. We investigated 322 variants in 88 small GTPase genes in germline DNA of 18,736 EOC patients and 26,138controls of European ancestry using a custom genotype array and logisticregression fitting log-additive models. Functional annotation was used toidentify biofeatures and expression quantitative trait loci that intersect withrisk variants. One variant, ARHGEF10L (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 10 like) rs2256787, was associated with increased endometrioid EOC risk (OR = 1.33, p = 4.46 x 10-6). Other variants of interest included another in ARHGEF10L,rs10788679, which was associated with invasive serous EOC risk (OR = 1.07, p =0.00026) and two variants in AKAP6 (A-kinase anchoring protein 6) which wereassociated with risk of invasive EOC (rs1955513, OR = 0.90, p = 0.00033;rs927062, OR = 0.94, p = 0.00059). Functional annotation revealed that the twoARHGEF10L variants were located in super-enhancer regions and that AKAP6 rs927062was associated with expression of GTPase gene ARHGAP5 (Rho GTPase activatingprotein 5). Inherited variants in ARHGEF10L and AKAP6, with potentialtranscriptional regulatory function and association with EOC risk, warrantinvestigation in independent EOC study populations.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197561 PMCID: PMC6034790PMID: 29979793
