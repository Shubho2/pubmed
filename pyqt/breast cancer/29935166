[Epub ahead of print]Glypican 3 Overexpression across a Broad Spectrum of Tumor Types Discovered with Functional Genomic mRNA Profiling of a Large Cancer Database.Moek KL(1), Fehrmann RSN(1), van der Vegt B(2), de Vries EGE(1), de Groot DJA(3).Author information: (1)Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen,University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.(2)Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Groningen, University ofGroningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.(3)Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Center Groningen,University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands. Electronic address:d.j.a.de.groot@umcg.nl.Glypican 3 (GPC3), a membrane-bound heparan sulfate proteoglycan, isoverexpressed in approximately 70% to 80% of hepatocellular carcinomas, butuncommonly expressed in healthy tissues. This raised interest in GPC3 as a drugtarget and several GPC3-targeting drugs are in clinical development. We thereforepredicted GPC3 protein overexpression across tumors and validated thesepredictions. Functional genomic mRNA profiling was applied to the expressionprofiles of 18,055 patient-derived tumor samples to predict GPC3 overexpressionat the protein level in 60 tumor types and subtypes using healthy tissues asreference. For validation, predictions were compared with immunohistochemical(IHC) staining of a breast cancer tissue microarray and literature data reportingIHC GPC3 overexpression in various solid, hematologic, and pediatric tumors. The percentage of samples with predicted GPC3 overexpression was 77% forhepatocellular carcinomas (n = 364), 45% for squamous cell lung cancers(n = 405), and 19% for head and neck squamous cell cancers (n = 344). Breastcancer tissue microarray analysis showed GPC3 expression ranged from 12% to 17%in subgroups based on estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 status. In 28 of 34 tumor types for which functional genomic mRNA datacould be compared with IHC there was a relative difference of ≤10%. This studyprovides a data-driven prioritization of tumor types and subtypes for futureresearch with GPC3-targeting therapies.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.
