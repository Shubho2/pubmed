The objective of this study was to evaluate thefactors causing mastalgia. All patients who presented to our clinic withcomplaints of mastalgia were assessed along with their type of mastalgiasymptoms, menopausal status, and radiology results.METHODS: A total of 3157 patients with mastalgia complaints visited our clinicbetween January 2015 and February 2018. Only 1294 of them were retrospectivelyscreened. Age, sex, menopausal (premenopausal, postmenopausal) status, mastalgia type (cyclic, non-cyclic), and imaging findings of the patients were examined.RESULTS: The mean age was 43.8 ± 11.8 (13-86) years, with 453 (35%) patientsyounger than 40 years and 841 (65%) older than 40. Cyclic mastalgia was found in 207 (16%) patients, and non-cyclic mastalgia was seen in 1087 (84%) patients. Atotal of 786 (60.7%) patients were premenopausal, and 508 (39.3%) werepostmenopausal. Mammography was used in 545 (42.1%) patients; 1190 (92.0%) women had breast ultrasonography.CONCLUSION: Although breast pain is a common symptom in women who are referred tobreast outpatient clinics, we concluded that patients who complain of mastalgiashould not be afraid of cancer. Despite this and for reassurance, clinicalimaging may be necessary to alleviate these patients' suspicions.DOI: 10.1007/s12325-018-0769-y PMID: 30094702
