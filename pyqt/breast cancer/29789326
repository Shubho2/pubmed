There is an urgent demand for prognosticbiomarkers that facilitate early tumor detection, as the incidence of HCC hastripled in the USA in the last three decades. Biomarkers to identify populations at risk would have significant impact on survival. We recently found thatexpression of Neuronal Calcium Sensor 1 (NCS1), a Ca2+-dependent signalingmolecule, predicted disease outcome in breast cancer, but its predictive value inother cancer types is unknown. This protein is potentially useful becauseincreased NCS1 regulates Ca2+-signaling and increased Ca2+-signaling is ahallmark of metastatic cancers, conferring cellular motility and an increasingly aggressive phenotype to tumors.METHODS: We explored the relationship between NCS1 expression levels and patient survival in two publically available liver cancer cohorts and a tumor micro arrayusing data mining strategies.RESULTS: High NCS1 expression levels are significantly associated with worsedisease outcome in Asian patients within these cohorts. In addition, a variety ofCa2+-dependent and tumor growth-promoting genes are transcriptionallyco-regulated with NCS1 and many of them are involved in cytoskeleton organizationsuggesting that NCS1 induced dysregulated Ca2+-signaling facilitates cellularmotility and metastasis.CONCLUSIONS: We found NCS1 to be a novel biomarker in HCC. Furthermore, our studyidentified a pharmacologically targetable signaling complex that can influencetumor progression in HCC.IMPACT: These results lay the foundation for utilizing NCS1 as a prognosticbiomarker in prospective cohorts of HCC patients and for further functionalassessment of the characterized signaling axis.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0167 PMID: 29789326
