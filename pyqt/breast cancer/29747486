[Epub ahead of print]Omitting Adjuvant Radiotherapy for Hormone Receptor‒Positive Early-Stage BreastCancer in Old Age: A Propensity Score Matched SEER Analysis.Kim YJ(1), Shin KH(1), Kim K(2).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, Seoul National University College ofMedicine, Seoul, Korea.(2)Department of Radiation Oncology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the non-inferiority ofomitting radiotherapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for hormonereceptor (HR)‒positive T1N0 breast cancer in elderly women.Materials and Methods: From 2004 to 2014, HR-positive T1N0 breast cancer patientsaged 50 years or older and receiving BCS were retrieved from the Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End.Results: 18 database. After propensity score matching between the no-RT and RTgroups, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Identifiedprognostic factors were used to stratify the risk groups. In each risk group,10-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were compared between the no-RT and RT groups.Results: After propensity score matching, the numbers of patients in the no-RTand RT groups were both 18,586. For patients who satisfied both a tumor size of1-10 mm and a tumor grade of 1-2, omitting RT did not decrease the CSS rate atany age group, ranging from ≥ 50 to ≥ 85 years; for patients aged ≥ 50 years, the10-year CSS rates in the no-RT and RT groups were 97.2% and 96.8%, respectively(adjusted hazard ratio, 0.862; p = 0.312). However, for patients with a tumorsize of 11-20 mm or tumor grade of 3-4, RT significantly increased the CSS rateirrespective of age.Conclusions: RT after BCS for HR-positive T1N0 breast cancer in elderly womenmight be omitted without causing a decrease in the CSS rate, but only in patientswho satisfy both a small tumor size (≤ 10 mm) and low tumor grade (1-2).DOI: 10.4143/crt.2018.163 PMID: 29747486
