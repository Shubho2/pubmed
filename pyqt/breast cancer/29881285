Breast Cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy with more than1â€‰million new cases each year and ranks the leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide. In this review, we will discuss recent progresses of the rolesand mechanisms of cancer-derived EVs in metastatic breast cancer, with a special attention on tumor microenvironment construction, progression, andchemo/radiotherapy responses. This review also covers EV roles as biomarker andtherapeutic target in clinical application.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418767666 PMCID: PMC5987895PMID: 29881285
