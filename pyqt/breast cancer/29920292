Electronicaddress: kunnumakkara@iitg.ernet.in.The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α- induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8/TIPE) family is adeath effector domain (DED)-containing protein family with four identifiedmembers: TNFAIP8 (TIPE), TNFAIP8L1 (TIPE1), TNFAIP8L2 (TIPE2), and TNFAIP8L3(TIPE3). These proteins were found to play crucial roles in the regulation ofimmune homeostasis, inflammation, and cancer development. Intensive research inthe past two decades revealed a strong correlation of TIPE proteins with thedevelopment of various cancers including cancers of the bladder, blood, bone,breast, cervix, colon, esophagus, endometrium, stomach, liver, lung, ovary,pancreas, prostate, and thyroid gland. Also, deregulation of these proteins wasfound to promote the essential hallmarks of cancer such as survival, tumorgrowth, proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion,migration, and metastasis. Further, differential expression of these proteins in normal and cancer tissues and their association with tumor progression andprognosis signifies the potential diagnostic and prognostic values of TIPEproteins and their importance in cancer therapy. The current review summarizesthe literature available thus far on the expression, function, and role of TIPEproteins in the development and maintenance of various cancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
