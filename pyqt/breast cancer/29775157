While tissue biomarkers are most useful in determining prognosis and upfrontpredicting response to therapy, circulating protein biomarkers such as CA 15-3and carcinoembryonic antigen are mainly used in monitoring response to endocrine or chemotherapy in patients with advanced disease. Although several centersmeasure biomarkers in asymptomatic patients following curative surgery forprimary breast cancer, the clinical utility of this practice is unclear.Promising new biomarkers for breast cancer include circulating tumor DNA andcirculating tumor cells. In contrast to circulating protein biomarkers,measurement of circulating tumor DNA-based biomarkers is potentially useful inidentifying mechanisms of resistance to ongoing therapies as well as identifying new targets for further treatment. To increase clinical utility, both theestablished and emerging circulating biomarkers should where possible beincorporated into randomized trials evaluating new therapies in patients withbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1177/1010428318776169 PMID: 29775157  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
