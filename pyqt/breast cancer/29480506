[Epub ahead of print]Patient-Provider Communication: Experiences of Low-Wage-Earning Breast CancerSurvivors in Managing Cancer and Work.Nichols HM(1), Swanberg JE(2), Vanderpool RC(3).Author information: (1)School of Social Work, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA.(2)School of Social Work and Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Schoolof Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA.(3)Department of Health, Behavior & Society, University of Kentucky College ofPublic Health, 2365 Harrodsburg Road, Suite A230, Lexington, KY, 40504, USA.robin@kcr.uky.edu.In 2017, there will be more than 250,000 new diagnoses of invasive breast cancer;most cases will occur in working-age women. The goal of this qualitative studywas to explore low-wage-earning breast cancer survivors' experiencescommunicating with their oncology team about cancer and employment issues.Twenty-four low-wage-earning breast cancer survivors in the USA were interviewed in 2012 using a structured interview protocol. Sociodemographic data, cancerhistory, and patient-provider communication experiences regarding the management of cancer and work were collected. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theorystrategy of constant comparative analysis. Low-wage-earning breast cancersurvivors' experiences communicating with their oncology team about employmentand cancer focused on three dimensions of patient-provider communication: extent,quality, and content. Over 70% of respondents reported no communication or onlyroutine communication with their providers regarding work; three quarters ofwomen reported poor or standard communication quality, and content ofwork-related communication covered scheduling issues, work absences, continuingto work during treatment, and financial concerns. Communication between oncology care teams and low-wage-earning cancer patients is critical to the successfulmanagement of treatment and work responsibilities given the vulnerable employmentsituation of these women. There is a need for education of oncology team members about how cancer and its treatment can impact employment for all workers, butespecially for low-wage workers, thereby allowing the care team to address these issues proactively and help patients successfully manage both cancer treatmentand work responsibilities.DOI: 10.1007/s13187-018-1338-4 PMID: 29480506
