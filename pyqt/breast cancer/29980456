The exact mechanism for thiscomplication is not completely understood. Yet, it is most likely to be amultifactorial condition. Several patient-, surgery-, and implant-specific riskfactors have been related to cause capsular contracture. This review aims toprovide a clear overview of all risk factors for capsular contracture.METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed focusing on patient-,surgery-, and/or implant-related factors related to capsular contracture inbreast implants. PubMed, Embase, and Wiley/Cochrane Library databases weresearched for relevant articles published from inception up to October 20, 2016.The included studies were assessed for the following main variables: studycharacteristics, patient characteristics, indication for surgery, type ofsurgery, implant characteristics, and other characteristics.RESULTS: Data on the risk factors for the development of capsular contracturewere retrieved from 40 studies. A presumptive increased risk in the developmentof capsular contracture is shown for the following variables: longer duration of follow-up, breast reconstructive surgery in patients with a history of breastcancer, subglandular implant placement, postoperative hematoma, and a texturedimplant surface. There is little, weak, or no evidence for the association ofother factors with capsular contracture. This review also shows a largeheterogeneity between studies and within the definition of capsular contracture.CONCLUSION: This review provides an overview of the relationship betweenpatient-, surgery-, and implant-specific risk factors in the development ofcapsular contracture.Copyright Â© 2018 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and AestheticSurgeons.
