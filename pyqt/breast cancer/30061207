Heterozygous GATA3mutations occur in up to 15% of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors andhave been proposed to be null alleles resulting in haploinsufficiency; however,the mutation spectrum of GATA3 in breast cancer is in sharp contrast to thatfound in HDR syndrome, a true GATA3 haploinsufficiency disease.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transgenic mice, 3D cultures and xenografts were used toexamine the effect of mutant GATA3 expression on mammary cell proliferation.RESULTS: Mutant GATA3 accelerated tumor growth of ZR751 cell xenografts andpromoted precocious lobuloalveolar development in transgenic mouse mammaryglands.CONCLUSION: GATA3 mutations, recently observed in breast cancer, encode activetranscription factors, which elicit proliferative phenotypes in normal mammaryepithelium and promote the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cell lines.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12745 PMID: 30061207  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
