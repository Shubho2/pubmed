R. China.As a popular sample preparation approach, filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) has been widely used in proteomic analysis. However, several limitations havebeen noted, including sample loss during filtration, repetitive centrifugationsteps, and the possibility of breakage of filtration membrane. Extraction biasamong different sample preparation strategies presents another challenge. Toovercome these limitations and address remaining challenges, we developed a novelsurfactant and chaotropic agent assisted sequential extraction/on-pelletdigestion (SCAD) protocol. The new strategy resulted in higher protein yield and improved peptide recovery and protein coverage compared to two conventionalsample preparation methods (FASP and urea). In combination of three strategies,more than 10,000 distinct protein groups were identified with 1% FDR fromMDA-MB-231 cells without any prefractionation. This in-depth proteome analysiswas accomplished by optimization of protein extraction, enzymatic digestion, LCgradient, and peptide sequencing method. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) ofproteins exclusively identified in SCAD revealed several crucial signalingpathways that regulate breast cancer progression. SCAD also enabled an unbiasedextraction of different categories of proteins (membrane, intracellular, nuclear)associated with tumorigenesis, which integrates the advantages of FASP and ureaextraction. This novel strategy expedites comprehensive protein identification,which is applicable for biomarker discovery in various types of cancers.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00197 PMID: 29923408
