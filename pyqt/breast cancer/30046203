The present study aimed to determinate the risk levelof breast cancer in terms of various BBD subgroups.Methods: A meta-analysis was performed to determinate the risk of breast cancerassociated with BBD. Observational studies (traditional case-control studies,nested case-control studies, and cohort studies) published from January 2000 toJune 2015 were assessed to evaluate the risk of developing breast cancer related to BBD. Various databases such as Medline (PubMed), Web of Science (ISI), Scopus,and Google Scholar were searched. The additional search included the Journal ofBreast Cancer Research and Treatment and the Journal of Cancer Research.Results: Twenty studies out of 21 were used to estimate the risk of developingbreast cancer related to proliferative disease without atypia versusnon-proliferative disease and the reported risk ranged from 1.04 to 1.83. Thereported risk of developing breast cancer related to proliferative disease withatypia versus non-proliferative disease in 21 studies ranged from 1.59 to 4.74.Based on 20 studies, the pooled risk estimates for developing breast cancerrelated to proliferative disease without atypia versus non-proliferative disease was 1.58 (95% CI: 1.51-1.66). Based on 21 studies, the pooled risk estimates for developing breast cancer related to proliferative disease with atypia versusnon-proliferative disease was 3.49 (95% CI: 3.23-3.77).Conclusion: The overall result of this review showed an elevated risk for breast cancer related to BBD subtypes. We propose better strategies for screeningrecommendations for such women.PMCID: PMC6055208PMID: 30046203
