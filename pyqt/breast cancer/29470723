A random-effect model was usedto determine the pooled hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS)using the inverse-variance method. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used tocalculate the pooled odds ratio (OR) for overall response, clinical benefit rate and treatment-related side effects. Heterogeneity was measured using thetau-squared and I2 statistics.RESULTS: After a systematic search, three phase III RCT (n = 1827) were included.The use of CDK 4/6 inhibitors (abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib) incombination with an AI was significantly associated with longer PFS compared tothe use of letrozole or anastrozole alone (HR: 0.57; 95% CI 0.50-0.65;p < 0.00001), with no significant heterogeneity among trials. Similarly, overall response rate and clinical benefit rate were higher for patients who received thecombination therapy than for patients allocated to AI alone. Grade 3 or highertreatment-related side effects were more frequently reported for patients whoreceived CDK 4/6 inhibitors (OR: 7.51; 95% CI 6.01-9.38; p < 0.00001), theseincluded mainly neutropenia, leukopenia and anemia.CONCLUSION: The addition of CDK 4/6 inhibitors (either abemaciclib, palbociclib, or ribociclib) to an AI (anastrozole or letrozole) significantly improved PFS,overall response rate, and clinical benefit rate in comparison with anonsteroidal AI alone.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0848-6 PMID: 29470723
