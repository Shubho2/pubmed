For 22 of 40 patients,a goggle-type liquid crystal display monitor was used for VF. The opposingtangential field was planned. The prescribed dose was 50.0 Gy in 25 fractions.RESULTS: The mean differences of the chest wall respiratory movement in DIBHbetween planning CT-scanning and simulation were 4.7 ± 2.6 mm for the patientswithout VF and 1.0 ± 0.9 mm for those with VF (p < 0.01). The mean chest wallexcursion as a whole in DIBH using VF (2.0 ± 1.0 mm) was smaller than in thosewithout VF (4.1 ± 2.4 mm) (p < 0.01). According to reproducibility and stability parameters, 4 mm was added as a posterior margin to the clinical target volumefor RT with VF, and 10 mm for those without VF. The mean heart doses were1.3 ± 0.5 Gy with VF and 2.4 ± 1.1 Gy without VF (p < 0.01). Mean dose and maxdose of right breast were significantly reduced in procedures with VF use vs. in those without VF (p < 0.01 and < 0.01, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: VF increases the accuracy of postoperative radiotherapy with DIBH,and also helps reduce the dose for OARs.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0870-8 PMID: 29761316
