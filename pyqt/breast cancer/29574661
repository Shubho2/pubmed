We conducted a systematic review of the literature andmeta-analysis.METHODS: Eligible studies were identified on Medline and EMBASE updated to the 19of September 2017. Studies with sufficient comparative data were included in ameta-analysis. Analyses were carried out using RevMan software.RESULTS: Three comparative studies with a total of 317 individuals with breastcancer and 1459 controls. Reviewing the literature demonstrated conflictingconclusions of the influence of consanguinity upon breast cancer. Themeta-analysis showed that there were no statistically significant associationsbetween consanguinity and breast cancer though there was a trend protection from a history of consanguinity.CONCLUSION: Though there is limited literature published on the effects ofparental consanguinity, the available data does not demonstrate that it is a riskfactor for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s11845-018-1791-4 PMID: 29574661
