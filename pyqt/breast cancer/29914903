BMJ Case Rep. 2018 Jun 17;2018. pii: bcr-2018-224420. doi:10.1136/bcr-2018-224420.Isolated thyroid metastasis from benign phyllodes tumour.Kho MR(1)(2), Abelardo AD(3)(4).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, University of the Philippines Manila, Manila,Philippines.(2)Department of Surgery, Manila Doctors Hospital, Manila, Philippines.(3)Department of Pathology, University of the Philippines Manila, Manila,Philippines.(4)Department of Pathology, Manila Doctors Hospital, Manila, Philippines.We present a rare and interesting case of a 35-year-old woman who initiallyunderwent an uneventful wide excision for a 13 cm left benign phyllodes tumour.She then noted a slowly growing left thyroid nodule 8 months postsurgery which onthyroidectomy 4 years later was shown to be a 6.9cm isolated thyroid metastasisfrom the phyllodes tumour. As this may be the first reported such case in theliterature, implications on histological classification, predictive factors fordisease progression, mechanisms of metastasis, and evaluation, management andsurveillance of benign phyllodes tumours and thyroid nodule/s with a history ofphyllodes tumour can thus be significantly impacted.Â© BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article)2018.
