However, quercetin has extremely low water solubility, which is amajor challenge in drug absorption.METHOD: In this study, we described a simple method for the synthesis ofquercetin nanoparticles. The quercetin nanoparticles had an average diameter of82 nm and prominent yellow emission under UV irradiation. Therefore, we used anin vitro model treated with quercetin and quercetin nanoparticles to investigate the effects of quercetin nanoparticles on MCF-7 breast cancer cell line.FINDING: MCF-7 cells were cultured with different concentrations (1-100 μM) ofquercetin nanoparticles at the 24th, 48th and 72 nd hours, and cell cycle andapoptosis assays were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). In this study, we foundthat quercetin nanoparticles (1-100 μM) could significantly reduce cell vitality,growth rate and colony formation of MCF-7 cells.CONCLUSION: Quercetin nanoparticles can inhibit cell growth by blocking the cell cycle and promoting apoptosis in MCF-7 cells more than quercetin. As a result,quercetin nanoparticles may be useful therapy or prevention on breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.174 PMID: 29698680
