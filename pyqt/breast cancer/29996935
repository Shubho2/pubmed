Indeed, ETV4 is overexpressed in breast tumors and isassociated with distant metastasis and poor prognosis. However, the cellular and molecular events regulated by this factor are still misunderstood. In mammaryepithelial cells, ETV4 controls the expression of many genes, MMP13 among them.The aim of this study was to understand the function of MMP13 during ETV4-driven tumorigenesis.METHODS: Different constructs of the MMP13 gene promoter were used to study thedirect regulation of MMP13 by ETV4. Moreover, cell proliferation, migration,invasion, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo tumorigenicity were assayedusing models of mammary epithelial and cancer cells in which the expression ofMMP13 and/or ETV4 is modulated. Importantly, the expression of MMP13 and ETV4messenger RNA was characterized in 456 breast cancer samples.RESULTS: Our results revealed that ETV4 promotes proliferation, migration,invasion, and anchorage-independent growth of the MMT mouse mammary tumorigeniccell line. By investigating molecular events downstream of ETV4, we found thatMMP13, an extracellular metalloprotease, was an ETV4 target gene. Byoverexpressing or repressing MMP13, we showed that this metalloproteasecontributes to proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent clonogenicity.Furthermore, we demonstrated that MMP13 inhibition disturbs proliferation,migration, and invasion induced by ETV4 and participates to ETV4-induced tumorformation in immunodeficient mice. Finally, ETV4 and MMP13 co-overexpression isassociated with poor prognosis in breast cancer.CONCLUSION: MMP13 potentiates the effects of the ETV4 oncogene during breastcancer genesis and progression.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0992-0 PMCID: PMC6042225PMID: 29996935
