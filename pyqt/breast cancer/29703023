Of those, 53 (35.8%) hadspinal metastasis. The baseline characteristics were compared by status of spinalmetastasis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine whetherthe serum irisin can be a candidate for predicting breast cancer to spinalmetastasis. The correlation coefficient analysis was used to confirm thecorrelation between the serum irisin and lipid metabolic parameters and body massindex (BMI), respectively.The serum irisin was higher in patients without spinal metastasis (7.60 ± 3.80). Multivariable analysis showed that the serum irisin wasprotective to the presence of spinal metastasis in patients with breast cancerafter adjustments of age and BMI (odds ratio, 0.873; 95% confidence interval,0.764-0.999). Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the serumirisin and BMI (r = 0.263). The patients with metabolisc syndrome (MetS) had ahigher level in serum irisin. In addition, the higher numbers of MetS components were associated with higher serum irisin.Higher serum irisin can be a protective factor of spinal metastasis in patients with breast cancer. The BMI is positivelyassociated with the serum level of irisin. Furthermore, patients with MetS tendedto have a higher level of serum irisin.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010524 PMCID: PMC5944558PMID: 29703023  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
