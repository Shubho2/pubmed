CE+BZA undergo first-pass-metabolism inthe liver and deconjugation by gut microbiome via β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymeinside the distal gut. To date, the impact of long-term exposure to CE+BZA on thegut microbiome or GUS activity has not been examined. Our study using anovariectomized mouse model showed that CE+BZA administration did not affect theoverall cecal or fecal microbiome community except that it decreased theabundance of Akkermansia, which was identified as a fecal biomarker correlatedwith weight gain. The fecal GUS activity was reduced significantly and waspositively correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillaceae in the fecalmicrobiome. We further confirmed in Escherichia coli K12 and Lactobacillusgasseri ADH that Tamoxifen-, 4-hydroxy-Tamoxifen- and Estradiol-Glucuronidescompeted for GUS activity. Our study for the first time demonstrated thatlong-term estrogen supplementation directly modulated gut microbial GUS activity.Our findings implicate that long-term estrogen supplementation impactscomposition of gut microbiota and microbial activity, which affects estrogenmetabolism in the gut. Thus, it is possible to manipulate such activity toimprove the efficacy and safety of long-term administered estrogens forpostmenopausal women or breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-26506-1 PMCID: PMC5970144PMID: 29802368
