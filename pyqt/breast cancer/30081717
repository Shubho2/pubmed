[Epub aheadof print]Successful treatment using apatinib in intractable brain edema: A case report andliteratures review.Song Y MD, PhD(1), Liu B MD, PhD(2), Guan M Master of Medicine(1), Liu M(2).Author information: (1)a Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Center, The First Hospital , JilinUniversity , Changchun , China.(2)b Department of Radiation Oncology, The First Hospital , Jilin University ,Changchun , China.The treatment of intractable vasogenic brain edema (VBE) caused by tumor andirradiation is challenging. Traditional intervention strategy includesdehydration and glucocorticoids accompanied by obvious side effects and minoreffects after long-term use. Novel treatment needs to be found urgently.Recently, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR pathway has beenrevealed to be essential in VBE. Therefore, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)targeting VEGFR which blocks (VEGF)/VEGFR signal might be effective. However,such reports have seldom been described. Herein, we documented a heavily-treated breast cancer patient experienced progressive aphasia, limb activity disorder andintermittent convulsion 10 months after radiotherapy of brain metastasis (BM).Cranial MRI demonstrated large peritumoral brain edema (PTBE). High dose ofsteriods and dehydration had no improvement. Apatinib with a dose of 250mg daily was initiated and all her discomforts disappeared after 10 days of use. The brainMRI of taking apatinib 5 weeks demonstrated remarkable shrinkage of edema. Ourcase indicates that apatinib, a potent small-molecular TKI targeted VEGFR2 ispromising for intractable VBE for satisfactory efficacy and safety. This case is of great value in its rarity and because it provides new insight into PTBEmanagement in clinical practice.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2018.1491502 PMID: 30081717
