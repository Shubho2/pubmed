The PAM50 assay categorizes breast tumors into: Luminal A, Luminal B,HER2-enriched and Basal-like. However, tumors are often more complex than simple categorization can describe. The identification of heritable tumorcharacteristics has potential to decrease heterogeneity and increase power forgene finding.Methods: We used 911 sporadic breast tumors with PAM50 expressiondata to derive tumor dimensions using principal components (PC). Dimensions in238 tumors from high-risk pedigrees were compared with the sporadic tumors.Proof-of-concept gene mapping, informed by tumor dimension, was performed usingShared Genomic Segment (SGS) analysis.Results: Five dimensions (PC1-5) explained the majority of the PAM50 expression variance: three captured intrinsic subtype, two were novel (PC3, PC5). All five replicated in 745 TCGA tumors. Both noveldimensions were significantly enriched in the high-risk pedigrees (intrinsicsubtypes were not). SGS gene-mapping in a pedigree identified a 0.5 Mbgenome-wide significant region at 12q15 This region segregated through 32 meiosesto 8 breast cancer cases with extreme PC3 tumors (P = 2.6 × 10-8).Conclusions: PCanalysis of PAM50 gene expression revealed multiple independent, quantitativemeasures of tumor diversity. These tumor dimensions show evidence forheritability and potential as powerful traits for gene mapping.Impact: Our study suggests a new approach to describe tumor expression diversity, provides newavenues for germline studies, and proposes a new breast cancer locus. Similarreparameterization of expression patterns may inform other studies attempting to model the effects of tumor heterogeneity.
