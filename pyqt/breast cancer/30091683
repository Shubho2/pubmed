However, theeffects of the microRNA miR-142-3p, a small endogenous regulator of geneexpression on breast cancer stem cells, have not been investigated. This studyidentifies the influence of miR-142-3p on mammary stemness properties and breast cancer radioresistance to establish its role in this setting. miR-142-3pprecursor transfection was performed in MDA-MB-468, HCC1806, and MCF-7 cells, andstem cell markers CD44, CD133, ALDH1 activity and mammosphere formation weremeasured. β-catenin, the canonical wnt signaling effector protein, was quantifiedby Western blots and cell fluorescence assays both in miR-142-3p-overexpressingand anti-miR-142-3p-treated cells. Radiation response was investigated by colony formation assays. Levels of BRCA1, BRCA2, and Bod1 in miR-142-3p-overexpressingcells as well as expression of miR-142-3p, Bod1, KLF4, and Oct4 in sortedCD44+/CD24-/low cells were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. miR-142-3p overexpression resulted in a strong decline in breast cancer stem cellcharacteristics with a decrease in CD44, CD133, ALDH1, Bod1, BRCA2, andmammosphere formation as well as reduced survival after irradiation. miR-142-3pexpression was strongly reduced in sorted CD44+/CD24-/low stem cells, while Bod1,Oct4, and KLF4 were overexpressed. β-catenin levels strongly decreased aftermiR-142-3p overexpression, but not after anti-miR-142-3p treatment. We concludethat miR-142-3p downregulates cancer stem cell characteristics andradioresistance in breast cancer, mediated by a reduced role of β-catenin inmiR-142-3p-overexpressing cells. miR-142-3p might therefore help to target cancerstem cells.DOI: 10.1177/1010428318791887 PMID: 30091683
