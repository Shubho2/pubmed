It is unclear how cancer cells become aneuploid or how highlyaneuploid tumors are different from those of more normal ploidy. We developed asimple computational method that measures the degree of aneuploidy or structural rearrangements of large chromosome regions of 522 human breast tumors from TheCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Highly aneuploid tumors overexpress activators ofmitotic transcription and the genes encoding proteins that segregate chromosomes.Overexpression of three mitotic transcriptional regulators, E2F1, MYBL2, andFOXM1, is sufficient to increase the rate of lagging anaphase chromosomes in anon-transformed vertebrate tissue, demonstrating that this event can initiateaneuploidy. Highly aneuploid human breast tumors are also enriched in TP53mutations. TP53 mutations co-associate with the overexpression of mitotictranscriptional activators, suggesting that these events work together to providefitness to breast tumors.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
