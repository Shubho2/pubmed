Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), acomplementary and alternative therapy, has reduced subjective measures of stress,anxiety, and fatigue among BCS. Little is known, however, about how MBSR affects objective markers of stress, specifically the stress hormone cortisol and thepro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). In the present study, BCS ( N =322) were randomly assigned to a 6-week MBSR program for BC or usual-carecontrol. Measurements of cortisol, IL-6, symptoms, and quality of life wereobtained at orientation and 6 weeks. Cortisol and IL-6 were also measured priorto and after the MBSR(BC) class Weeks 1 and 6. The mean age of participants was56.6 years and 69.4% were White non-Hispanic. Most had Stage I (33.8%) or II(35.7%) BC, and 35.7% had received chemotherapy and radiation. Cortisol levelswere reduced immediately following MBSR(BC) class compared to before the classWeeks 1 and 6 (Wilcoxon-signed rank test; p < .01, d = .52-.56). IL-6 wassignificantly reduced from pre- to postclass at Week 6 (Wilcoxon-signed ranktest; p < .01, d = .21). No differences were observed between the MBSR(BC) andcontrol groups from baseline to Week 6 using linear mixed models. Significantrelationships with small effect sizes were observed between IL-6 and bothsymptoms and quality of life in both groups. Results support the use of MBSR(BC) to reduce salivary cortisol and IL-6 levels in the short term in BCS.DOI: 10.1177/1099800418789777 PMID: 30079756
