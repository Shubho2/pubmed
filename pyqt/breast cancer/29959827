[Epubahead of print]Coordinate transformation aided finite element method for contour detection ofbreast tumors in microwave imaging.Ozgun O(1), Kuzuoglu M(2).Author information: (1)Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Hacettepe University,Turkey.(2)Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Middle East TechnicalUniversity, Turkey.A coordinate transformation based finite element method is presented fordetecting contours of breast cancer tissues in the context of microwave imaging. The geometry and location of a single or multiple cancerous tumors inside abreast tissue are identified by constructing an inverse problem based on thegenetic optimization algorithm. The expensive forward solution phase duringrepeated cost function evaluations is accelerated by placing a transformationmedium inside the finite element mesh. This allows using a uniform or rectangularmesh even when irregular tumor geometries are considered. Therefore, thecomputational load is reduced. The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB usingparallel programming tools. A realistic numerical breast phantom repository,which is available in the University of Wisconsin-Madison webpage, is used totest the algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is also tested by utilizing the Monte Carlo approach, where the inverse problem is run several times and the statistical parameters of the runs are determined. Various simulation results aredemonstrated.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/cnm.3124 PMID: 29959827
