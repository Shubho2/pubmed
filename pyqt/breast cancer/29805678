In TNBC, a high expression of the membrane bound G protein-coupled estrogen receptor(GPER), correlates with a worse outcome. There is a potential for an association between growth hormone receptor (GHR) and GPER expression. To confirm thishypothesis, GHR was inhibited in TNBC cells with Somavert, and GPER expressionlevels, and the effect on signal transduction and proliferation induction in TNBCcells were analyzed. Proliferation of TNBC cells was measured using anAlamar-blue assay. Expression of GPER and activation of c-src and epidermalgrowth factor receptor (EGFR) by 17β-estradiol was analyzed by western blotting. Induction of c-fos, cyclin D1 and aromatase expression was determined by reverse transcription-semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of GPERwas concentration- and time-dependently reduced by Somavert down to 46±7%(P<0.01) of the control. Furthermore, 17β-estradiol significantly increased thecell number of HCC1806 cells to 128±14% (P<0.05), and that of MDA-MB-453 cells to115±3%. This increase in cell number was reduced to 103±11% in HCC1806 cells inwhich GPER expression was downregulated by Somavert, and to 102±3% in MDA-MB-453 cells. In addition, 17β-estradiol increased the activation of c-src in HCC1806cells by 1.8-fold, and Somavert reduced p-src to 63% of control. In MDA-MB-453cells src phosphorylation increased by 7-fold upon stimulation with estradiol,but after treatment with Somavert only a 4-fold increase was observed.Phosphorylation of EGFR was increased by 2.2-fold of control in HCC1806 cells by 17β-estradiol, and by 1.4-fold in MDA-MD-453 cells. Somavert completely preventedthis activation. Induction of cyclin D1 and aromatase expression by 17β-estradiolwas also prevented by Somavert. Somavert reduces GPER expression in triplenegative breast cancer cells. Treatment with Somavert prevents induction of genesregulating proliferation by 17β-estradiol. Inhibition of GPER expression is apromising therapeutic intervention for TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8521 PMCID: PMC5958647PMID: 29805678
