This studyevaluated whether preoperative ultrasound-guided wire localization of the clippednode is useful for routine clinical practice.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective, single-center feasibility trial included patients with invasive breast cancer (cT1-3N1-3M0) treated by primary systemictherapy. They underwent ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy and clip placementinto the most suspicious axillary lymph node prior to chemotherapy. After primarysystemic therapy the clipped lymph node was localized by a wire. All patientsunderwent target lymph node biopsy, completion axillary lymph node dissectionand, if yiN0, axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy. The primary study endpoint wasthe identification rate of the target lymph node.RESULTS: All patients (n = 30) underwent successful clip insertion into the lymphnode. After chemotherapy, the clipped target lymph node was visible by ultrasoundin 83.3% (25/30). Wire localization was possible in 24 cases (80%), and theclipped node identification rate was 70.8% (17/24 cases). In 9/30 patients (30%) clipped node removal was not confirmed by intraoperative radiography.CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided wire localization of the target lymph node is notsuitable for clinical practice because of limitations regarding clip visibilityand selective surgical preparation of the target lymph node. Further prospective evaluation of alternative techniques is needed.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejso.2018.05.035 PMID: 29935839
