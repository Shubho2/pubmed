Connexin proteins enable such dynamicchanges during development, and their dysregulation leads to disease states. The gap junction communication channels formed by connexins have been reported toexhibit tumor-suppressive functions, including in triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC). However, we find that connexin 26 (Cx26) is elevated in self-renewingcancer stem cells (CSCs) and is necessary and sufficient for their maintenance.Cx26 promotes CSC self-renewal by forming a signaling complex with thepluripotency transcription factor NANOG and focal adhesion kinase (FAK),resulting in NANOG stabilization and FAK activation. This FAK/NANOG-containingcomplex is not formed in mammary epithelial or luminal breast cancer cells. Thesefindings challenge the paradigm that connexins are tumor suppressors in TNBC and reveal a unique function for Cx26 in regulating the core self-renewal signalingthat controls CSC maintenance.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-02938-1 PMCID: PMC5805730PMID: 29422613
