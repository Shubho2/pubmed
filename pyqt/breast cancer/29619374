Molecularclassification of BC is based on biological gene-expression profiling. In thisstudy, biomarker modulation was assessed during BC treatment in 30 previouslyuntreated patients. Heterogeneity among patients was pathologically diagnosed andclassified into luminal and basal-like immunohistochemical profiles based onestrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor (ER/PR/HER2)status. Marker heterogeneity was compared with mRNA biomarker expression inpatients with BC before and after therapy. Reverse transcription-polymerase chainreaction was performed for molecular characterization. Expression and modulation of biological markers, CK19, hMAM, CEA, MUC, Myc, Ki-67, HER2/neu, ErbB2, and ER,were assessed after treatment, where the expression of the biomarkers CK19,Ki-67, Myc, and CEA was noted to be significantly decreased. Marker expressionmodulation was determined according to different stages and pathologicalcharacteristics of patients; coexpression of three markers (CK19, Ki-67, and Myc)was specifically modulated after therapy. In the histopathologically classifiedbasal-like group, two markers (CK19 and Ki-67) were downregulated and could beconsidered as diagnostic biomarkers. In conclusion, pathological characteristics and marker variation levels can be evaluated to decide a personalized treatmentfor patients.DOI: 10.1155/2018/7154708 PMCID: PMC5830017PMID: 29619374
