Aclosed-aperture Z-scan technique was used to measure the sign and magnitude ofthe nonlinear refractive index of each sample. Prior to the Z-scan, all sampleswere fixed with 1 mL of 5% paraformaldehyde.RESULTS: The sign of the nonlinear refractive indices of MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 breastcancer cell lines were negative and positive, respectively. The repeated Z-scanmeasurements for all samples of each cell line were similar.CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the proposed bio-optical method is areliable method for characterizing differences in various breast cancer celltypes. It is suggested that the nonlinear refractive index of cells be consideredas an indicator for differentiating various breast cell lines from each other.Copyright © 2018.
