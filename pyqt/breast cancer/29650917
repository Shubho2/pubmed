Gan To Kagaku Ryoho. 2018 Mar;45(3):498-500.[A Case of Primary Spinddle Cell Carcinoma of the Breast].[Article in Japanese]Kawai H(1), Yoshikawa C, Kawasaki K, Iga N, Yoshida R, Waki N, Uno F, Ishizaki M,Nishi H, Yamashita K, Miyoshi S.Author information: (1)Dept. of Surgery, Okayama Rosai Hospital.A 76-year-old female underwent breast-conserving surgery of the right breast and sentinel lymph node biopsy for primary breast cancer. Three years later,mammography and ultrasonography showed a small nodule in the right breast. There was nothing abnormal in the left breast. Three months later, she complained of a huge and rapid growing mass in the left breast. Malignant cells were obtained on fine needle aspiration biopsy in the right breast tumor. But it was not possible to diagnose whether the left breast tumor was benign or malignant on fine needle aspiration biopsy and needle biopsy. Bilateral mastectomy and sentinel lymph nodebiopsy of the right side were performed. Pathological diagnosis were squamouscell carcinoma of the right breast and spindle cell carcinoma of the left breast.Although the patient was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, she had an earlyrelapse with pleural, lung and bone metastases. The patient died approximately 8 months after operation. Spindle cell carcinoma presents many problems abouttherapy and prognosis. Further accumulation analysis is necessary.PMID: 29650917  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
