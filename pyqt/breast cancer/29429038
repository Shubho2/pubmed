Box 85500, 3508 GA, Utrecht, The Netherlands.Trastuzumab is associated with cardiotoxicity, manifesting as a decrease of theleft-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Administration of anthracyclines priorto trastuzumab increases risk of cardiotoxicity. High-sensitive troponin T andN-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are molecular markers thatmay allow earlier detection of drug-induced cardiotoxicity. In this analysis weaimed to quantify the kinetics and exposure-response relationships of LVEF,troponin T and NT-proBNP measurements, in patients receiving anthracycline andtrastuzumab. Repeated measurements of LVEF, troponin T and NT-proBNP and dosingrecords of anthracyclines and trastuzumab were available from a previouslypublished clinical trial. This trial included 206 evaluable patients with earlybreast cancer. Exposure to anthracycline and trastuzumab was simulated based onavailable dosing records and by using a kinetic-pharmacodynamic (K-PD) and afixed pharmacokinetic (PK) model from literature, respectively. The change frombaseline troponin T was described with a direct effect model, affected bysimulated anthracycline concentrations, representing myocyte damage. Therelationship between trastuzumab and LVEF was described by an indirect effectcompartment model. The EC50 for LVEF decline was significantly affected by themaximum troponin T concentration after anthracycline treatment, explaining 15.1% of inter-individual variability. In this cohort, NT-proBNP changes could not bedemonstrated to be related to anthracycline or trastuzumab treatment.Pharmacodynamic models for troponin T and LVEF were successfully developed,identifying maximum troponin T concentration after anthracycline treatment as asignificant determinant for trastuzumab-induced LVEF decline. These models canhelp identify patients at risk of drug-induced cardiotoxicity and optimizecardiac monitoring strategies.DOI: 10.1007/s10928-018-9579-8 PMCID: PMC5953989PMID: 29429038
