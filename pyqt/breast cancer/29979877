[Epub ahead ofprint]Development of Folate-Thioglycolate-Gold Nanoconjugates by Using Citric Acid-PEG Branched Polymer for Inhibition of MCF-7 Cancer Cell Proliferation.Mani G(1), Kim S(1), Kim K(1).Author information: (1)Division of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences and Bioengineering ,Incheon National University , Incheon , Korea 22012.Development of folate (FA)-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has greatly increased in recent years due to their potential in cancer treatment. As surface functionalization of polymer-free AuNPs with thiol groups could result inagglomeration and precipitation, AuNPs should be stabilized with an efficientpolymer. In this study, citric acid-PEG branched polymer (CPEG) acted as areducing as well as stabilizing agent in the synthesis of AuNPs. The thiol group of thioglycolic acid (TGA) attached to CPEG-stabilized AuNPs and interacted with the free carboxylic acid group on the surface of TGA-AuNP nanoconjugates. Stable TGA-AuNP nanoconjugates were obtained only with CPEG-stabilized AuNPs and notwith citrate-stabilized AuNPs. The carboxylic acid group on the surface of AuNPs was used to attach FA via an EDC/NHS coupling reaction to obtain FA-TGA-AuNPnanoconjugates. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that FA-TGA-AuNPs werenot toxic to normal cells up to a concentration of 200 μg/mL. However,FA-TGA-AuNP nanoconjugates effectively inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 cancercells at a low concentration of 25 μg/mL after 3 days of incubation. Theanticancer activity of FA-TGA-AuNPs was enhanced by incorporating the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil into the nanoconjugates, which exhibited sustained drugrelease up to 5 days. Hence, the developed biocompatible FA-TGA-AuNPs could beused for specific killing of breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1021/acs.biomac.8b00543 PMID: 29979877
