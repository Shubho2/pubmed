This study was designed to evaluate BioZorb®effect on radiation boost clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume(PTV), median dose to ipsilateral lung (Gy), and heart irradiation in left-sided cancers.Methods: Data was collected via a retrospective cohort study with two study arms:BioZorb® intra-operative placement versus no BioZorb® placement. Patients werestratified by BMI, age, tumor laterality and volume, and cancer stage. Mean,standard deviation, median, range of cubic centimeters of clinical and planningtarget volume, cardiac dose in left-sided cancers, ipsilateral lung dose, andvolume of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 Gy were reported.Results: Of 143 patients, median CTV (cm3) was 8.7 and 14.2 (P = 0.0048), median PTV (cm3) was 53.2 and 79.6 (P = 0.0010), median ipsilateral lung Gy was 7.53 and6.74 (P = 0.0099) and volume (cc) of ipsilateral radiation lung at 20 Gy was 13.4and 12 (P = 0.008), and median heart Gy in left-sided cancers was 2.01 and 2.21(P = 0.9952) in BioZorb® and non-BioZorb® arms, respectively. Patients with BMIs of 25-30 had CTV medians of 7.8 and 11.1 in BioZorb® and non-BioZorb® arms,respectively (P = 0.0293).Conclusion: The BioZorb® arm showed statistically significant reductions in CTVand PTV but not ipsilateral lung or heart irradiation.DOI: 10.1007/s13566-017-0339-y PMCID: PMC5978798PMID: 29937986
