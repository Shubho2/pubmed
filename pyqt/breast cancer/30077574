Bodycomposition (measured by DXA) and blood markers of lipid and glucose weremeasured at baseline, and at 12, 24, and 36 weeks. The exercise group performed40 min of resistance exercises on machines followed by 30 min of aerobic trainingon a treadmill, three times per week. Separate 2 (group) × 4 (time)repeated-measure ANOVAs were used to compare groups over time.RESULTS: Significant group × time interactions were found for total and trunk fatmass (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001) and % body fat (p < 0.001), where women in theexercise group lost fat compared to slight gains among women in the stretchingcontrol group. There were no significant differences between groups for leanmass, hip or spine BMD, metabolic markers, or CRP.CONCLUSION: Our aerobic + resistance exercise program prevented fat gain, but maynot have been sufficient to improve metabolic or bone health markers in olderbreast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
