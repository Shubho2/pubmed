In the present study, CXCL12-mediated Ca2+ signallingwas compared with two basal-like breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 andMDA-MB-468, which demonstrate distinct metastatic potential. CXCL12 treatmentinduced Ca2+ responses in the more metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells but not in theless metastatic MDA-MB-468 cells. Assessment of mRNA levels of CXCL12 receptorsand their potential modulators in both cell lines revealed that CXCR4 and CXCR7levels were increased in MDA-MB-231 cells compared with MDA-MB-468 cells. Clusterof differentiation (CD)24, the negative regulator of CXCL12 responses,demonstrated increased expression in MDA-MB-468 cells compared with MDA-MB-231cells, and the two cell lines expressed comparable levels of hypoxia-induciblefactor (HIF)2α, a CXCR4 regulator. Induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT) by epidermal growth factor exhibited opposite effects on CXCR4 mRNA levels compared with hypoxia-induced EMT. Neither EMT inducer exhibited an effect onCXCR7 expression, however hypoxia increased HIF2α expression levels in MDA-MB-468cells. Analysis of the gene expression profiles of breast tumours revealed thatthe highest expression levels of CXCR4 and CXCR7 were in the Claudin-Lowmolecular subtype, which is markedly associated with EMT features.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7827 PMCID: PMC5835901PMID: 29541196
