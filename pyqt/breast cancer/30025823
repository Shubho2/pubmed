Inthe present study, we aimed to explore the effect of quercetin, a bioactiveflavonoid, on tumor metastasis and cell glycolysis and its related functionarymechanism in breast cancer progression. Firstly, trans-well invasion assay andwound healing assay indicated that quercetin effectively suppressed cellmobility. The corresponding western blot revealed that quercetin treatmentdown-regulated the expression of cell migration marker proteins, such as matrixmetalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).The further experiments exhibited that quercetin successfully blocked cellglycolysis by inhibiting the level of glucose uptake and the production of lacticacid, and also decreased the level of glycolysis-related proteins Pyruvate kinaseM2 (PKM2), Glucose transporter1(GLUT1) and Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Theabove results revealed that quercetin might inhibit glycolysis to limit themigration of tumor cells by reducing the acidity of the tumor microenvironment.Moreover, our further investigation showed that quercetin induced obviousautophagy via inactivating the Akt-mTOR pathway. At the same time, theapplication of autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and Akt-mTOR pathway inducer IGF-1further demonstrated that quercetin exerted inhibiting effect on cell mobilityand glycolysis through Akt-mTOR pathway mediated autophagy induction. At last,the in vivo experiments also showed that quercetin treatment could suppress tumorgrowth and metastasis, inhibit glycolysis and induce autophagy through theinhibition of p-AKT/AKT. Taken together, we firstly revealed that quercetinsuppressed the progression of breast cancer by inhibiting cell mobility andglycolysis through Akt-mTOR pathway mediated autophagy induction and may provide a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.Copyright Â© 2018.
