These new compounds were evaluated fortheir in vitro cytotoxic potential against human lung (A549), prostate (PC-3 and DU145), breast (MCF-7) and colon (HT-29 and HCT-116) cancer cell lines. Among allthe tested compounds, one of the derivatives 8p showed good anti-proliferativeactivity against A549 lung cancer cell line with an IC50 of 3.17 ± 0.52 µM. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that compound 8p arrested both Sub G1 and G2/Mphases of cell cycle in a dose dependent manner. The compound 8p also displayedsignificant inhibition of tubulin polymerization and disruption of microtubulenetwork (IC50 of 5.15 ± 0.15 µM). Molecular docking studies revealed thatcompound 8p efficiently interacted with critical amino acid Cys241 of theα/β-tubulin by a hydrogen bond (SH…O = 2.4 Å). Further, the effect of 8p on cell viability was also studied by AO/EB, DCFDA and DAPI staining. The apoptoticcharacteristic features revealed that 8p inhibited cell proliferation effectivelythrough apoptosis by inducing the ROS generation. Analysis of mitochondrialmembrane potential through JC-1 staining and annexin V binding assay indicatedthe extent of apoptosis in A549 cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
