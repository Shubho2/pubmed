Theprognostic significance of the micropapillary component (MC) ratio thatconstitutes this aggressive variation is controversial. In this study, we aimedto investigate the effect of the MC ratio on the prognosis of these patients.METHODS: The data of 47 patients with IMPC were retrospectively reviewed.Patients were divided into two groups: MC ratio of 10-75% (Group 1) and greaterthan 75% (Group 2). The demographic characteristics of the patients,histopathologic features of the tumors, and survival rates were compared.RESULTS: We detected no significant difference in demographic characteristicsbetween groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.21). No significant difference was detected interms of tumor diameter, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion,histologic grade, multicentricity, local recurrence, distant metastasis, andoverall survival.CONCLUSION: In the micropapillary subgroup of invasive ductal carcinoma, althoughpositive receptor characteristics are directly proportional to the increase in MCratio, recurrence and survival rates are not affected by micropapillary componentlevel.DOI: 10.1080/08941939.2018.1474302 PMID: 29843540
