Epub 2018 May 17.Breast cancer in the GCC countries: A focus on BRCA1/2 and non-BRCA1/2 genes.Rahman S(1), Zayed H(2).Author information: (1)Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Health and Sciences, QatarUniversity, Doha, Qatar.(2)Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Health and Sciences, QatarUniversity, Doha, Qatar. Electronic address: hatem.zayed@qu.edu.qa.The GCC is an economic alliance of six Arab countries, including Bahrain, Kuwait,Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). The rate of endogamousmarriage among the GCC countries is approaching 100%, with very highconsanguineous marriage rates. Although breast cancer is on the rise in the GCCcountries, there are dearth of studies reporting on the genetic epidemiology ofbreast cancer. In this study, we investigated the frequency of BRCA1/2 andnon-BRCA1/2 mutations in breast cancer patients in the GCC countries. BRCA1/2mutations seem not to be significantly involved in hereditary breast cancer inthe GCC countries, which is the most reported form of cancer in Oman, however no available data about the BRCA1/2 mutations role in breast cancer in the UAE.Mutations in more than 30 non-BRCA1/2 genes were reported to be associated withbreast cancer patients in the GCC countries, some with comparable frequencies to the BRCA1/2 genes. Arab patients with breast cancer showed advanced stages ofcancer and younger ages of onset compared to other Western countries. The Arabgenome project pioneered by Saudi Arabia, followed by Qatar, Kuwait, and UAE,will help in the identification of new biomarkers for breast cancer that will be a target for new therapeutics and is expected to improve the prognosis of thedisease. However, there is an urgent need for extensive well-controlled geneticepidemiological studies to provide accurate estimates of the frequency of geneticvariants in both BRCA1/2 and non-BRCA1/2 among patients with breast cancer in theGulf States, to provide better care and genetic counseling for Arab patients withpredisposing genetic mutations to breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
