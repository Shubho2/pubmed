However, BRCA genetic tests cannot be routinelyperformed, and some BRCA mutations could not be defined as deleterious mutations or normal variants. Therefore, an easy functional assay of BRCA will be useful toevaluate BRCA status. As it has been reported that BRCA functions in theregulation of centrosome number, we focused on centrosome number in cancertissues. Here, 70 breast cancer specimens with known BRCA status were analyzedusing immunofluorescence of γ-tubulin (a marker of centrosome) foci. The numberof foci per cell was higher in cases with BRCA mutation compared to wild-typecases, that is, 1.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.3) vs 0.5 (95% CI,0.2-0.8) (P < .001). Specifically, foci numbers per cell in BRCA1 and BRCA2mutation cases were 1.2 (95% CI, 0.6-1.8) and 2.2 (95% CI, 1.7-2.6),respectively, both higher than those in wild-type cases (P = .042 and P < .0001, respectively). The predictive value of γ-tubulin foci as determined by area underthe curve (AUC = 0.86) for BRCA status was superior to BRCAPRO (AUC = 0.69),Myriad Table (AUC = 0.61), and KOHBRA BRCA risk calculator (AUC = 0.65) pretestvalues. The use of γ-tubulin foci to predict BRCA status had sensitivity = 83%(19/23), specificity = 89% (42/47), and positive predictive value = 77% (20/26). Thus, γ-tubulin immunofluorescence, a functional assessment of BRCA, can be used as a new prospective test of BRCA status.© 2018 The Authors.
