A dearth of evidence on the costs of such interventions mightprevent new policies from achieving more ambitious targets.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on the population ofcolorectal (88,051), breast (90,387), prostate (96,219), and lung (97,696) cancerpatients diagnosed after a GP referral or an emergency presentation and reported in the Cancer Registry of England. Resource use and survival were compared 1 yearbefore and 5 years after diagnosis (3 years for lung), including the costs of GP referrals not converted into a positive diagnosis. Risk-adjusted statisticalmodels were used to calculate the effect of rerouting patient' diagnoses fromemergency presentation to GP referral.RESULTS: Rerouting a cancer diagnosis results in a relatively small additionalcosts to the National Health System against additional years of life saved to thepatient. The cost per year of life saved is £6456 in colorectal, £1057 in breast,-£662 in prostate (savings), and £819 in lung cancer. Reducing the overallprevalence of emergency presentations to the level achieved by the 20% ofClinical Commissioning Groups with the lowest prevalence would result in£11,481,948 against 1863 years of life saved for Colorectal, £847,750 against889 years for breast, -£943,434 (cost savings) against 1195 years for prostate,and £609,938 against 1011 years for lung cancer.CONCLUSION: Redirecting diagnoses from emergency presentation to GP referralappears an achievable target that can produce large benefits to patients against modest additional costs to the National Health System.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4274-0 PMCID: PMC5889525PMID: 29625606
