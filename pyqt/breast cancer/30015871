China.Beclin1 (BECN1), which directly interacts with B‑cell lymphoma 2, serves animportant role in autophagy and is involved in the tumorigenesis of various typesof cancer. However, the definite role of BECN1 in breast cancer remainscontroversial. Bi-allelic knockout of Becn1 in a mouse model leads to anembryonic lethal phenotype, which hampers further investigation. To generate celllines with knockout of BECN1, the CRISPR/Cas9 technique was used to disrupt BECN1in human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA‑MB‑231 cells. To the best ofour knowledge, the present study was the first to successfully disrupt BECN1 inMDA‑MB‑231 cells and to screen three stable monoclonal BECN1‑knockout cell lines,suggesting that BECN1‑knockout is not lethal in TNBC cells. Functional analysisrevealed that complete loss of BECN1 suppressed MDA‑MB‑231 proliferation andcolony formation via inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, not apoptosis, in vitro.On the other hand, BECN1‑knockout inhibited the migratory and invasive ability ofMDA‑MB‑231 cells by partially reversing signals of epithelial-mesenchymaltransition. Finally, analysis of publicly available gene expression datasetsrevealed increased expression of BECN1 in TNBC samples. Taken together, theresults of the present study identified BECN1 as an oncogene, providing a novelpotential target for the treatment of TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4472 PMID: 30015871
