[Epub ahead of print]Clinical trial cytology: Use of on-site evaluation of small biopsy and FNAsamples for clinical trials and biomarker research studies.Manzo JL(1), Cuda J(1), Pantanowitz L(1), Xing J(1), Yu J(1), Beasley HS(1), DhirR(1), Monaco SE(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.BACKGROUND: After increased requests for biopsies for clinical trials andbiomarker research, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center created aclinical trial research service that partnered pathology, radiology, and medicineto facilitate rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of fine-needle aspiration (FNA)and/or core needle biopsy (CNB) samples to confirm the presence of tumor in thesestudies.METHODS: Clinical trial coordinators organized biopsies for patients needingtumor samples for trials, and informed the cytopathology and radiology team. ROSEwas performed to confirm the presence of sufficient tumor in FNA specimens and/ortouch preparations of CNB.RESULTS: A total of 79 cases from a total of 14 clinical trials were evaluatedwith ROSE, 77 of which (97%) were for research only. There were 53 cases (67%)from breast/ovarian cancer studies that were initiated between 2008 and 2009,whereas 26 cases (33%) included a variety of other tumors for studies that werestarted between 2011 and 2014. The majority required CNB samples (60 cases; 76%),20% of which used an FNA for needle placement before obtaining CNB material and56% of which had touch preparations of the CNB evaluated without a preceding FNA.The concordance rate for ROSE with final adequacy of the sample was 96% to 100%.CONCLUSIONS: The study institution has experienced an increase in the number ofclinical trial studies requesting ROSE to confirm the presence of tumor in avariety of malignancies. Cytology laboratories can help with patient care byoffering ROSE to determine the adequacy of clinical trial material to minimizethe submission of unsatisfactory or nonrepresentative material. Developing aclinical research service enhances communication and the processing of novelresearch specimens for cancer patients.
