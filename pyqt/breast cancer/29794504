The procedure is described in detail, and the results are analyzed in terms of both cosmetic and oncological results.RESULTS: The flap successfully reached all breast quadrants as necessary, as wellas the areola-nipple complex. The resection borders were found to be free oftumor in all cases, and there were no perioperative complications. Patients ratednearly all the cosmetic parameters as "somewhat satisfied" or "very satisfied,"and there was no evidence of fat necrosis in the postoperative mammographyexaminations.CONCLUSIONS: Applying principles taken from the cosmetic plastic surgery lies at the base of any high standard reconstructive surgery in general and oncoplasticbreast surgery in particular. The chest wall-based flap is suitable for thereconstruction of a wide range of breast lumpectomy defects and is feasible forsmall- to medium-sized breasts, which are usually not easily amenable to tissuerearrangement techniques. The learning curve is short, with replicable results.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001490 PMID: 29794504
