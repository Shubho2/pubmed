However, not all breasttumors will respond similarly to treatment with 5-Aza-dC, and little is knownregarding the response of hormone-resistant breast cancers to 5-Aza-dC.Methods: We demonstrate that 5-Aza-dC-treatment has a stronger effect on anestrogen receptor-negative, Tamoxifen-selected cell line, TMX2-28, than on theestrogen receptor-positive, MCF7, parental cell line. Using data obtained fromthe HM450 Methylation Bead Chip, pyrosequencing, and RT-qPCR, we identified apanel of genes that are silenced by promoter methylation in TMX2-28 andre-expressed after treatment with 5-Aza-dC.Results: One of the genes identified, tumor associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2), is altered by DNA methylation, and there is evidence that in somecancers decreased expression may result in greater proliferation. Analysis of DNAmethylation of TACSTD2 and protein expression of its product, trophoblast antigenprotein 2 (TROP2), was extended to a panel of primary (n = 34) and recurrent(n = 34) breast tumors. Stratifying tumors by both recurrence and ER statusshowed no significant relationship between TROP2 levels and TACSTD2 methylation. Knocking down TACSTD2 expression in MCF7 increased proliferation however;re-expressing TACSTD2 in TMX2-28 did not inhibit proliferation, indicating thatTACSTD2 re-expression alone was insufficient to explain the decreasedproliferation observed after treatment with 5-Aza-dC.Conclusions: These results illustrate the complexity of the TROP2 signalingnetwork. However, TROP2 may be a valid therapeutic target for some cancers.Further studies are needed to identify biomarkers that indicate how TROP2signaling affects tumor growth and whether targeting TROP2 would be beneficial tothe patient.DOI: 10.1186/s12935-018-0589-9 PMCID: PMC6034260PMID: 30002602
