Several retrospective studies havechallenged this paradigm, demonstrating survival advantage with surgery in denovo metastatic disease. Prospective studies are ongoing and maturing data. Acomprehensive approach to local therapy following systemic therapy may bebeneficial to achieve improved survival outcome associated with stage IV- noevidence of disease and to decrease local failure in inflammatory breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
