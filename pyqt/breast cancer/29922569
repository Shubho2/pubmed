To understand the metabolic redirections ofinhibitor treatment on cancer cells, this study established a 13C-metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA)-based method to evaluate metabolic redirection in MCF-7 breastcancer cells using mass spectrometry. A metabolic stationary state necessary for accurate 13C-MFA was confirmed during an 8-24 h window using low-dose treatments of various metabolic inhibitors. Further 13C-labeling experiments using[1-13C]glucose and [U-13C]glutamine, combined with gas chromatography-massspectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs), confirmed that an isotopic stationary state of intracellular metabolites was reached 24 hafter treatment with paclitaxel (Taxol), an inhibitor of mitosis used for cancer treatment. Based on these metabolic and isotopic stationary states, metabolicflux distribution in the central metabolism of paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells wasdetermined by 13C-MFA. Finally, estimations of the 95% confidence intervalsshowed that tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolic flux increased after paclitaxeltreatment. Conversely, anaerobic glycolysis metabolic flux decreased, revealingmetabolic redirections by paclitaxel inhibition. The gap between totalregeneration and consumption of ATP in paclitaxel-treated cells was also found tobe 1.2 times greater than controls, suggesting ATP demand was increased bypaclitaxel treatment, likely due to increased microtubule polymerization. Thesedata confirm that 13C-MFA can be used to investigate inhibitor-induced metabolic redirection in cancer cells. This will contribute to future pharmaceuticaldevelopments and understanding variable patient response to treatment.DOI: 10.5702/massspectrometry.A0067 PMCID: PMC6002601PMID: 29922569
