In this study, wedeveloped a kind of manganese doped nigrosine originated carbon dots (Mn-NCDs),with the average particle size of approximate 3 nm and the long emissionwavelength of 653 nm. In vitro experiment demonstrated that Mn-NCDs could be wellinternalized by 4T1 cells, and the temperature of Mn-NCDs solution could rapidly rise from 23.1 °C to more than 50 °C when exposed to NIR laser, thus it couldgenerate enough hyperthermia to efficiently destroy 4T1 cells. Furthermore, thein vivo fluorescent and photoacoustic imaging studies highlighted theapplicability of Mn-NCDs in dual-mode tumor diagnosis. The prepared Mn-NCDs with long emission wavelength and photothermal anti-cancer effect exhibited greatpotential for dual-mode imaging and treatment of triple negative breast cancer.DOI: 10.1166/jbn.2018.2565 PMID: 29958553
