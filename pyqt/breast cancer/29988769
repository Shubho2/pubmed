Luminal B (HER2-) breast cancer subtype has been proposedsince the 2011 St Gallon consensus. The hormone receptor status in this type ofbreast cancer is positive; thus, endocrine therapy was performed in all cases,but the treatment was not satisfactory, and a significant number of casesreceived very little benefit from chemotherapy. Furthermore, there is noeffective treatment target for this subtype. Luminal B (HER2-) breast cancersubtype has been proposed since the 2011 St Gallon consensus. Therefore, thestudy of the key molecules in the microenvironment of breast cancer can help toreveal the biological characteristics.Patients and methods: Luminal B (HER2-) breast cancer is a subtype with higherheterogeneity and poorer prognosis than luminal A. It is known that thedevelopment of cancer cells is an active process, and this process needsmicroenvironment cytokines, including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) andcollagen IV. Therefore, CCL5 and collagen IV were imaged and detected by quantum dot, and the CCL5/collagen IV ratio was calculated to investigate the prognostic value of the CCL5/collagen IV ratio in luminal B (HER2-).Results: Quantitative determination showed a statistically significant negativecorrelation between CCL5 and collagen IV. The 5-year disease-free survival(5-DFS) of the high and low CCL5/collagen IV ratio subgroups was significantlydifferent. The CCL5/collagen IV ratio had a greater prognostic value for 5-DFS.The CCL5/collagen IV ratio was an independent prognostic indicator.Conclusion: Our findings revealed the effective integration of tumor CCL5 andcollagen IV, and a new method for predicting the prognosis of luminal B (HER2-)has been developed.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S159585 PMCID: PMC6030937PMID: 29988769  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
