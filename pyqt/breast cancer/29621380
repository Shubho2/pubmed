Models were adjusted for sociodemographics, tumor characteristics,treatment, body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided byheight in meters squared), and other body composition measures. We also evaluatedthe cross-classification of categories of sarcopenia (yes/no) and tertiles ofTAT, with outcomes.Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival time and all-cause mortality.Results: Median (range) age of 3241 women included in this study was 54 (18-80)years, and median follow-up was 6.0 years; 1086 patients (34%) presented withsarcopenia, and 1199 patients (37%) had low muscle radiodensity. Among patientswith nonmetastatic breast cancer, those with sarcopenia showed higher overallmortality (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.18-1.69) compared with those without sarcopenia.Patients in the highest tertile of TAT also showed higher overall mortality (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.08-1.69) compared with those in the lowest tertile. Lowradiodensity was not associated with survival. In analyses of sarcopenia and TAT,highest mortality was seen in patients with sarcopenia and high TAT (HR, 1.89;95% CI, 1.30-2.73); BMI alone was not significantly related to overall mortality and did not appropriately identify patients at risk of death owing to their body composition.Conclusions and Relevance: Sarcopenia is underrecognized in nonmetastatic breast cancer and occurs in over one-third of newly diagnosed patients. Measures of bothsarcopenia and adiposity from clinically acquired CT scans in nonmetastaticpatients provide significant prognostic information that outperform BMI and will help to guide interventions to optimize survival outcomes.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.0137 PMID: 29621380
