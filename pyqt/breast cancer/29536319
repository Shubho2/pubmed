The main outcome was receipt of genomic testing within 1Â year ofdiagnosis as a function of physician-level factors.RESULTS: A total of 24,463 patients met the study criteria; they received carefrom 3172 surgeons and 2475 medical oncologists. Of 4124 tests ordered, 70% were ordered by a medical oncologist and 16% by a surgeon. In multivariable regressionmodels, multiple variables were associated with receipt of testing, includinghaving a medical oncologist (odds ratio [OR] 2.77; 95% CI 2.00-3.82), a surgeonspecializing in surgical oncology (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.09-1.31), and a femalemedical oncologist (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.20). Having a medical oncologist with 5 or more years in practice was associated with lower odds of testing (OR 0.83;95% CI 0.76-0.92). Surgical procedures performed at academic centers wereassociated with higher odds of testing (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.02-1.20).CONCLUSIONS: Although most RS testing was ordered by medical oncologists,physicians in other specialties ordered roughly one-third of the tests. Physiciancharacteristics, including gender and time in practice, were associated withreceiving testing, creating opportunities for targeting interventions to helppatients receive optimal care.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4746-6 PMID: 29536319
