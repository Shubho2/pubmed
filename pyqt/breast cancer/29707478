Thisresearch studied the feasibility of using photoacoustic (PA) imaging foridentifying metastasis in the lymph vessels of mice. The photoacoustic efficiencyof various contrast agents was investigated, and the influence of scattered lightwas evaluated by using a lymph vessel phantom. The lymph vessels of mice werethen visualized using the selected contrast agents: indocyanine green (ICG) andgold nanorods (AuNR). The attenuation of the PA imaging was -1.90 dB/mm, whereas that of the fluorescence imaging was -4.45 dB/mm. The results indicate thepotential of identifying sentinel lymph nodes by using PA imaging with thesecontrast agents.DOI: 10.1016/j.pacs.2018.01.001 PMCID: PMC5914200PMID: 29707478
