Liposomes, safe and effective drug delivery carriers, canincorporate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs for combination chemotherapytreatment of cancers. The objectives of the current study were to synthesize and test the effectiveness of a nanotechnology-based strategy utilizing folic acid(FA)-conjugated liposomes that incorporate both celastrol (Cs) and irinotecan(Ir) for targeted breast cancer therapy. Our results revealed the successfulpreparation of Cs and Ir-loaded folate-targeted liposomes (Lipo/Cs/Ir-FA) with a small particle size (∼190 nm) and polydispersity index (∼0.10). The formulationexhibited higher drug release profiles for both Ir and Cs at pH 5.0 compared tothose at physiological pH, favoring cancer cell-targeted release. Furthermore, invitro cell studies showed high uptake and enhanced apoptosis in folatereceptor-positive breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), but not in folatereceptor-negative lung cancer cells (A549). Moreover, an in vivo study in a mousetumor model using MDA-MB-231 xenografts supported effective drug deliverybehavior of the folate-conjugated liposomes by selective targeting of tumortissue and minimizing systemic adverse effects. Therefore, our formulation could provide an effective therapy for targeted cancer treatment.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.DOI: 10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.07.013 PMID: 30005409
