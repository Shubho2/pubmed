A series of sulfonamides with predicted activitywere synthesized and tested against 60 human cancer cell lines with growthinhibition percent values. The highest antiproliferative activity againstleukemia (cell lines K-562 and MOLT-4), non-small cell lung cancer (cell lineNCI-H522), colon cancer (cell lines NT29 and SW-620), melanoma (cell linesMALME-3M and UACC-257), ovarian cancer (cell lines IGROV1 and OVCAR-3), renalcancer (cell lines ACHN and UO-31), breast cancer (cell line T-47D) was found forcompounds 4-9. According to the docking results the compounds 4-9 inducecytotoxicity by the disruption of the microtubule dynamics by inhibiting tubulin polymerization via effective binding into colchicine domain, similar the E7010.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
