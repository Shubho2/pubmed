Medical files were reviewed for demographic data, clinicalinformation, and radiology and pathology reports. Pathological results of thesurgical specimens were considered the gold standard for comparison with breastMRI findings. In women not undergoing excision, at least 2 years of follow-up wasused to ascertain the benign nature of the finding.RESULTS: Fifty patients were included in the study. Thirty-one (62%) patients hadsurgical excision of the ADH lesion, and 7 (23%) were upgraded to malignancy.Breast MRI accurately identified 6 of the 7 cases. Six of the 12 women (50%) withpositive MRI findings at the biopsy site were upgraded to malignancy on surgical pathology, compared with only 1 of 19 (5%) with negative MRI findings. Forty-ninepercent of the women with a negative MRI did not undergo surgical excision of theADH lesion, compared with 8% of the women with a positive MRI (P = .009), with nocancer diagnosed during follow-up. The sensitivity, specificity, negativepredictive value, and positive predictive value of breast MRI for predictingupgrade to malignancy were 86%, 83%, 97%, and 46%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: MRI may have a role in the management of women diagnosed with ADH onCNB, to minimize diagnostic excisional biopsies.Copyright © 2018 Canadian Association of Radiologists.
