We sought to analyze the role of LRT andprognostic factors of overall survival (OS) in de novo stage IV BC patientstreated with LRT utilizing the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB). The objective ofthe current study is to create and internally validate a prognostic scoring modelto predict the long-term OS for de novo stage IV BC patients treated with LRT.METHODS: We included de novo stage IV BC patients reported to NCDB between 2004and 2015. Patients were divided into LRT and no-LRT subsets. We randomized LRTsubset to training and validation cohorts. In the training cohort, aseventeen-point prognostic scoring system was developed based on the hazardratios calculated using Cox-proportional method. We stratified both training and validation cohorts into two "groups" [group 1 (0-7 points) and group 2 (7-17points)]. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare OS betweenthe two groups. Our prognostic score was validated internally by comparing the OSbetween the respective groups in both the training and validation cohorts.RESULTS: Among 67,978 patients, LRT subset (21,200) had better median OS ascompared to that of no-LRT (45 vs. 24 months; p < 0.0001). The group 1 and group 2 in the training cohort showed a significant difference in the 3-year OS(p < 0.0001) (68 vs. 26%). On internal validation, comparable OS was seen betweenthe respective groups in each cohort (p = 0.77).CONCLUSIONS: Our prognostic scoring system will help oncologists to predict theprognosis in de novo stage IV BC patients treated with LRT. Although firmtreatment-related conclusions cannot be made due to the retrospective nature ofthe study, LRT appears to be associated with a better OS in specific subgroups.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4802-2 PMID: 29721715
