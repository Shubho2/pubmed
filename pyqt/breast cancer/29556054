We evaluated GCGMM using aretrospectively collected 75 invasive ductal carcinoma with ERPR+ HER2- (n = 15),triple negative (TN) (n = 9), and ER-HER2+ (n = 57) cancers with variablepresentation (mass and non-mass enhancement) and background parenchymalenhancement (mild and marked). Expert delineated manual contours were used toassess the segmentation performance using Dice coefficient (DSC), mean surfacedistance (mSD), Hausdorff distance, and volume ratio (VR). GCGMM segmentationswere significantly more accurate than GrowCut (GC) and fuzzy c-means clustering(FCM). GCGMM's segmentations and the texture features computed from thosesegmentations were the most reproducible compared with manual delineations andother analyzed segmentation methods. Finally, random forest (RF) classifiertrained with leave-one-out cross-validation using features extracted from GCGMMsegmentation resulted in the best accuracy for ER-HER2+ vs. ERPR+/TN (GCGMM 0.95,expert 0.95, GC 0.90, FCM 0.92) and for ERPR + HER2- vs. TN (GCGMM 0.92, expert0.91, GC 0.77, FCM 0.83).DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22980-9 PMCID: PMC5859113PMID: 29556054
