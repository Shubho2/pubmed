In the currentstudy, the authors examined breast cancer-specific death by age, stage, anddisease subtype in a large, population-based cohort.METHODS: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, a total of486,118 women diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to IVbreast cancer between 2000 and 2012 were identified. Using a series of Fine andGray regression models to account for competing risk, the authors examined therisk of breast cancer-specific death by age and stage (I-IV) for subcohorts with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HR-negative, human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2-positive, and triple-negative disease, adjusting for demographic andclinical variables.RESULTS: Overall, 18% of women were aged 65 to 74 years, 13% were aged 75 to 84years, and 4% were aged ≥85 years. Regardless of stage of disease within theHR-positive and HR-negative cohorts, patients aged ≥75 years (vs those aged 55-64years) experienced a higher adjusted hazard of breast cancer-specific death,which was particularly evident for those with early-stage, HR-positive disease(hazard ratio for those aged 75-84 years, 1.88 [95% confidence interval,1.68-2.09] and hazard ratio for those aged ≥85 years, 3.59 [95% confidenceinterval, 3.12-4.13] [both for stage I disease]). In the cohorts with humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive and triple-negative disease, womenaged ≥70 years had a consistently higher risk of breast cancer-specific deathacross disease stages (vs those aged 51-60 years), with the exception of stage IVtriple-negative disease.CONCLUSIONS: Older patients experience worse breast cancer outcomes, regardlessof disease subtype and stage. With an increasing number of older patientsanticipated to develop breast cancer in the future, addressing disparities forolder patients must emerge as a clinical and research priority.
