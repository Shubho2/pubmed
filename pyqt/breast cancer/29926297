Next generation sequencing was performed on DNA from blood and breastcancer specimens available. Blood specimens negative for NF1 mutation weresubjected to multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to identify complete/partial deletions or duplications. Expression of neurofibromin in theNF1-associated breast cancers was evaluated using immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: There was a higher frequency of grade 3 (83.3% vs 45.4%, p = 0.005),oestrogen receptor (ER) negative (66.7% vs 26.3%, p < 0.001) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive (66.7% vs 23.4%, p < 0.001) tumoursamong NF1 patients compared to non-NF1 breast cancers. Overall survival wasinferior in NF1 patients in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 2.25, 95% CI1.11-4.60; p = 0.025). Apart from germline NF1 mutations (11/16; 69%), somaticmutations in TP53 (8/10; 80%), second-hit NF1 (2/10; 20%), KMT2C (4/10; 40%),KMT2D (2/10; 20%), and PIK3CA (2/10; 20%) were observed. Immunohistochemicalexpression of neurofibromin was seen in the nuclei and/or cytoplasm of allspecimens, but without any consistent pattern in the intensity or extent.CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive series of NF1-associated breast cancers suggests that their aggressive features are related to germline NF1 mutations incooperation with somatic mutations in TP53, KMT2C and other genes.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4851-6 PMID: 29926297
