Epub 2018 Apr 18.New Inhibitors of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2) Containing a2,4-Disubstituted Pyridopyrimidine Scaffold.Krapf MK(1), Gallus J(1), Vahdati S(1), Wiese M(1).Author information: (1)Pharmaceutical Institute , University of Bonn , An der Immenburg 4 , 53121Bonn , Germany.Multidrug resistance (MDR) occurring during cancer chemotherapy is a majorobstacle for effectiveness and response to therapy and is often caused byATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters. Belonging to the family of ABCtransporters, breast cancer resistance protein is getting more and more in thespotlight of research. As a strategy to overcome MDR, inhibitors of ABCtransporters were synthesized, which could be applied in combination withcytostatic drugs. For this purpose, 2,4-disubstituted pyridopyrimidinederivatives were synthesized. The investigations confirmed three keycharacteristics of good inhibitors: a low intrinsic cytotoxicity and a highpotency and selectivity toward ABCG2. For selected compounds the interaction withABCG2 was elucidated and their effect on ATPase activity and conformationsensitive 5D3 antibody binding was investigated. Their ability to reverse MDR in coadministration with the active metabolite of irinotecan and mitoxantron wasconfirmed.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01012 PMID: 29547272
