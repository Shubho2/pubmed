[Epub ahead of print]Toremifene, rather than tamoxifen, might be a better option for the adjuvantendocrine therapy in CYP2D6*10 T/T genotype breast cancer patients in China.Lan B(1), Ma F(1), Chen S(1), Wang W(1), Li Q(1), Fan Y(1), Luo Y(1), Cai R(1),Wang J(1), Yuan P(1), Zhang P(1), Li Q(1), Xu B(1).Author information: (1)Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing,100021, China.Toremifene (TOR) is a valid and safe alternative to tamoxifen (TAM) for adjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients with a metabolic pathway that differsfrom that of TAM. TOR might have a therapeutic advantage in certain subgroups of patients, such as Chinese women with the CYP2D6 *10 (c.100C>T) T/T genotype, who would get less benefit when receiving adjuvant TAM treatment. A total of 230breast cancer patients who received adjuvant TAM (n=115) or TOR (n=115) at theNational Cancer Center were analyzed. The CYP2D6 *10 genotype was notsignificantly associated with DFS in patients who received TOR (p=0.737).Patients treated with TOR had a higher 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) ratethan those treated with TAM (89.6% versus 80.9%, p=0.009). TOR treatment remainedan independent prognostic marker of DFS in multivariate analysis compared withTAM (hazard ratio=0.51; p=0.014). For all of the 50 CYP2D6 *10 T/T genotypepatients, TOR treatment group had a significantly higher 5-year DFS rate than TAMgroup (90.9% versus 67.9%, p=0.031). For the remaining 170 CYP2D6 *10 C/C or C/T genotype patients, there was no significant difference between the 5-year DFSrates of the TOR and TAM groups (89.2% versus 85.1%, p=0.188). The advantage ofadjuvant TOR over TAM in Chinese breast cancer patients might be caused by thesignificant benefit obtained by the CYP2D6 *10 T/T patients, who accounted forone-fifth of the overall population. TOR might be a good option for adjuvantendocrine therapy in this subgroup of patients in China. This article isprotected by copyright.
