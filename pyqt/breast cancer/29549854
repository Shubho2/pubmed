Autophagy as a biologically activated process in invasive cancer cells during acidosis, protect them from apoptosis in lower pH whichpresented in our work. As the autophagy is the only activated pathways which can maintain cellular proliferation in acidic media, responses of SiNW-ECIS inacidified cells could be correlated to the probability of autophagy activation innormal or cancer cells. In contrast, cell survival pathway wasn't activated inlow-grade cancer cells which resulted in their acidosis. The measured electrical resistance of MCF10, MCF7, and MDA-MB468 cell lines, by SiNW sensor, in normaland acidic media were matched by the biological analyses of their vitalfunctions. Invasive cancer cells exhibited increased electrical resistance in pH 6.5 meanwhile the two other types of the breast cells exhibited sharp (MCF10) andmoderate (MCF7) decrease in their resistance. This procedure would be a new trendin microenvironment based cancer investigation.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.jpba.2018.02.040 PMID: 29549854
