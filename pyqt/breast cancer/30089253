In a model of breast cellular transformation,various forms of nutrient deprivation differentially affect the rate of proteinsynthesis and its recovery over time. Genome-wide translational profiling ofglutamine-deprived cells reveals a rapid upregulation of mRNAs containing uORFsand downregulation of ribosomal protein mRNAs, which are followed by selectivetranslation of cytokine and inflammatory mRNAs. Transcription and translation of inflammatory and cytokine genes are stimulated in response to diverse metabolicstresses and depend on eIF2α phosphorylation, with the extent of stimulationcorrelating with the decrease in global protein synthesis. In accord with theinflammatory stimulus, glutamine deprivation stimulates the migration oftransformed cells. Thus, pro-inflammatory gene expression is coupled to metabolicstress, and this can affect cancer cell behavior upon nutrient limitation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.
