In the present study, the effects of paclitaxel (PTX)-induced reduction of body temperature and peripheral blood flow onmetastatic 4T1 breast cancer was investigated in a mouse model and themodification of these effects by thermoneutral temperature was also assessed. Asingle dose of PTX decreased the body temperature and peripheral blood flow inmice housed at a standard temperature (23°C). Furthermore, although lungmetastasis and angiogenesis of inoculated 4T1 cells increased in mice pretreated with PTX, mice housed at a thermoneutral temperature (30°C) could compensatetheir body temperature and peripheral blood flow compared with control mice, and also suppressed 4T1 angiogenesis and metastasis to lung. The present resultsimply that maintenance of body temperature or efficient energy supply forthermogenesis may prevent tumor relapse or metastasis after chemotherapy.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7621 PMCID: PMC5776906PMID: 29434941
