Clinical data on doses tothe LAD are limited.Materials and methods: Retrospective study of 14 patients who underwentpostoperative 3DCRT for left breast cancer in 2014. All data were retrieved from medical records. Means, medians, ranges, and percentages were calculated.Results: The mean dose to the LAD in patients with V25 < 1% was 0.12 cGy. Dmean, Dmax and V25 to the heart were, respectively, 3.7 Gy (range, 0.9-4.18), 40.3 Gy(9.28-62.9), and 1.59 cGy. The mean Dmean and Dmax values in the sample were9.71 Gy and 33.2 Gy, respectively. The maximum dose to the LAD (D2%) ranged from 3.66 to 53.01 Gy. Due to the spacing of the CT slices (5 mm), it was not possibleto completely contour the entire artery. The mean dose to the heart (3.3 Gy) was considered acceptable.Conclusions: The maximum dose to the LAD was as high as 53 Gy, suggesting anincreased risk of cardiac morbidity. This study underscores the value ofcontouring the LAD and the value of the breath hold technique to reduce maximumcardiac doses. Smaller CT cuts (2.5 mm) can improve contouring. Larger studieswith long-term follow up are needed to determine the radiation tolerance dose forthe LAD.DOI: 10.1016/j.rpor.2018.01.003 PMCID: PMC5908386 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29681771
