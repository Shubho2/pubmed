We aimed to evaluate the clinical relevanceof the presumed primary site of CUP and the clinical outcome of site-specifictherapy based on such presumptions.METHODS: Patients referred to our center who were diagnosed withunfavorable-subset CUP and treated between April 2007 and March 2015 wereenrolled in this study. Data were collected retrospectively from the hospitaldatabase and electronic medical records. Presumptive primary breast or ovariancancer was based on histological and immunohistochemical analyses and metastatic patterns. The outcomes of patients with unfavorable-subset CUP with a putativeprimary site in the breast or ovary (P-CUP) and of patients withunfavorable-subset CUP, but without P-CUP (U-CUP), were assessed.RESULTS: A total of 780 patients were referred to our hospital with malignancy ofunknown origin. Of these, 409 patients were diagnosed with CUP and 344 patientswith unfavorable-subset CUP. Following clinicopathological examination, 40(11.6%) of the 344 patients had P-CUP and the remaining 303 (88.3%) patients had U-CUP. In total, 136 patients received chemotherapy (22 with P-CUP and 114 withU-CUP). Among the 22 patients with P-CUP, three received hormonal therapy forbreast cancer, and 19 received chemotherapy based on the presumed primary organ(breast, 4; ovaries, 15). Conventional platinum-based chemotherapy wasadministered to 105 patients with U-CUP and non-platinum drug treatment to ninepatients. The objective response rates were 61.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.6-83.6) and 41.1% (95% CI: 31.8-50.4) for patients with P-CUP and U-CUP,respectively. The median overall survival durations were 50.0 months and16.9 months (log-rank: P = 0.002) for patients with P-CUP and U-CUP,respectively. P-CUP was identified as an independent predictor of good prognosis according to multivariate analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with P-CUP had higher response rates and a better prognosiscompared with patients with U-CUP. It might thus be reasonable to classify thissubset as a new category of CUP with a favorable prognosis.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4092-4 PMCID: PMC5809895PMID: 29433539
