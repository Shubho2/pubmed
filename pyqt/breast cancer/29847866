Hence, the development of effective cancer prevention strategies, as well as the discovery of novel therapeutic agents against cancer, is urgentlyrequired. In light of this challenge, this research aimed to evaluate the effectsof several potent bioactive peptides and proteins contained in crocodile whiteblood cell extract (cWBC) against LU-1, LNCaP, PC-3, MCF-7, and CaCo-2 cancercell lines. The results demonstrate that 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml cWBC exhibitsa strong cytotoxic effect against all investigated cell lines (IC₅₀ 70.34-101.0μg/ml), while showing no signs of cytotoxicity towards noncancerous Vero andHaCaT cells. Specifically, cWBC treatment caused a significant reduction in thecancerous cells' colony forming ability. A remarkable suppression of cancerouscell migration was observed after treatment with cWBC, indicating potentantimetastatic properties. The mechanism involved in the cancer cell cytotoxicityof cWBC may be related to apoptosis induction, as evidenced by typical apoptotic morphology features. Moreover, certain cWBC concentrations induced significantoverproduction of ROS and significantly inhibited the S-G₂/M transition in thecancer cell. The molecular mechanisms of cWBC in apoptosis induction were todecrease Bcl-2 and XIAP expression levels and increase the expression levels ofcaspase-3, caspase-8, and p53. These led to a decrease in the expression level ofthe cell cycle-associated gene cyclin-B1 and the arrest of cell populationgrowth. Consequently, these findings demonstrate the prospect of the use of cWBC for cancer therapy.DOI: 10.4014/jmb.1712.12002 PMID: 29847866
