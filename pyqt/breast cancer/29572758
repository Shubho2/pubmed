[Epub ahead ofprint]Does freedom make a difference? : An empirical investigation of differencesbetween subjective well-being and perceived capabilities amongst cancer patients.Tessier P(1), Thuilliez J(2).Author information: (1)Université de Nantes, Université de Tours, INSERM, SPHERE U1246, Nantes,France.(2)CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique)-Centre d'économie de laSorbonne, 75013, Paris, France. josselin.thuilliez@univ-paris1.fr.Perceived capabilities-a subjective operationalization of Sen's concept ofcapability-and subjective well-being are increasingly regarded as relevantinformation about individual well-being to guide resources allocation inhealthcare. Although they refer to different notions, both types of measures relyon self-reported information and little is known as to how they compare together empirically. The aim of this paper is to investigate differences between measuresof subjective well-being and of perceived capabilities in terms of theircorrelation with dimensions of health-related quality of life using panel dataconcerning a sample of 293 breast cancer and melanoma patients. Regressionanalyses suggest that the measures capture quite different aspects of thepatients' welfare. Differences in the correlation with dimensions of health also seem consistent with the underlying notions to which these measures refer.However, our findings also suggest that future researches should aim atdetermining how measures of perceived capabilities may be influenced byindividual personality traits.DOI: 10.1007/s10198-018-0967-1 PMID: 29572758
