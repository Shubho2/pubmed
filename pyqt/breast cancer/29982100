We aimed to evaluate whether epidemiological andclinicopathologic features are associated with the histological tumor grade ofbreast carcinomas in Western China.METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from the Western China ClinicalCooperation Group and assessed associations between clinicopathologic factors andhistological tumor grade in 8619 female breast cancer patients. Patients weredivided into two groups: Group I (tumor grade I/II) and Group II (tumor gradeIII). Univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression models were usedto analyze the relationships between clinicopathologic factors and tumor grade.RESULTS: Patients presenting with positive axillary lymph nodes, large tumor size(>2 cm), lymphovascular invasion, hormone receptor negativity, human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positivity, and triple negativity tended to havean increased risk of a high tumor grade. However, the number of pregnancies orbirths was inversely correlated with the risk of a high tumor grade. In addition,patients presenting with grade III tumors were more likely to receive aggressive treatment, such as adjuvant chemotherapy, anti-HER-2 therapy, and level IIIaxillary lymph node dissection.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that several clinicopathologic factors wereassociated with high tumor grade of breast cancer patients in Western China.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
