In our cancer center, the largest tertiary cancer center in Canada, patients withself-reported cancer-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) are offeredpsychoeducation intended to reduce distress about CRCD symptoms and improveeveryday cognitive performance, but evidence regarding this intervention's impactis lacking. Here, we assess whether a 1-hour (h), individual psychoeducationalintervention designed to promote self-management of CRCD symptoms can improveattitudes and coping with memory-related difficulties in women with breastcancer.METHODS: Breast cancer survivors with self-reported CRCD (N = 100) were assessed immediately before, immediately after, and 6 weeks following the intervention.Participants' memory contentment, knowledge of CRCD, symptom distress, andself-efficacy to cope with symptoms were measured.RESULTS: Participants showed improvements in memory contentment immediately afterthe intervention (Cohen's d effect size and 95% CI = 0.87 [0.58, 1.16]) and6 weeks later (d = 0.77 [0.48, 1.05]). Significant improvements in secondarystudy outcomes, including knowledge of CRCD (d = 1.32 [1.01, 1.63]), symptomdistress (d = - 0.82 [- 1.11, - 0.53]), and self-efficacy to cope with cognitive symptoms (d = 1.45 [1.14, 1.76]), were also observed.CONCLUSIONS: A single, 1-hour psychoeducational intervention can achieve lasting and improved adjustment to memory symptoms in breast cancer survivors withself-reported CRCD. Further investigation using a randomized controlled studydesign is warranted. Comparisons with previously reported psychoeducationalinterventions for CRCD are made, and next steps for this research are discussed.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4135-z PMID: 29525841
