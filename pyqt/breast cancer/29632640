China.MRTF-A is a transcriptional co-activator being critical for multiple processesincluding tissue fibrosis and cancer metastasis. The Rho-actin signalingstimulates the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of MRTF-A with little effect on the expression of MRTF-A gene. High expression of MRTF-A wasobserved in pancreatic cancer tissues and in TGF-β treated breast cancer cells.However, the mechanism for the upregulation of MRTF-A gene remains unclear. Inthis study, we showed that the transcription of MRTF-A was regulated by theWnt-β-catenin signaling in breast cancer cells. LiCl treatment, Wnt3a treatmentor β-catenin overexpression enhanced the transcription of MRTF-A gene. Inagreement, depletion of β-catenin with siRNA diminished MRTF-A transcription.With ChIP assays, β-catenin was identified to interact with the MRTF-A promoterwhereby it increased histone H4 acetylation and RNA polymerase II association.Further, results of RT-qPCR and Western-blotting supported that thetranscriptional co-activator activity of MRTF-A was controlled by both theRho-actin and the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathways. MRTF-A was required for cell migration stimulated by the Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that MRTF-A integrates the Rho-actin and the Wnt-β-catenin signaling toregulate migration-related genes and consequently increases the mobility ofbreast cancer cells.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23961 PMCID: PMC5880600PMID: 29632640
