Here, we investigated the ability for immune checkpointblockade to enhance the efficacy of oncolytic reovirus (RV) for the treatment of breast cancer (BrCa). In vitro, oncolysis and cytokine production were assessedin human and murine BrCa cell lines following RV exposure. Furthermore,RV-induced upregulation of tumor cell PD-L1 was evaluated. In vivo, theimmunocompetent, syngeneic EMT6 murine model of BrCa was employed to determinetherapeutic and tumor-specific immune responses following treatment with RV,anti-PD-1 antibodies or in combination. RV-mediated oncolysis and cytokineproduction were observed following BrCa cell infection and RV upregulated tumorcell expression of PD-L1. In vivo, RV monotherapy significantly reduced diseaseburden and enhanced survival in treated mice, and was further enhanced by PD-1blockade. RV therapy increased the number of intratumoral regulatory T cells,which was reversed by the addition of PD-1 blockade. Finally, dual treatment led to the generation of a systemic adaptive anti-tumor immune response evidenced by an increase in tumor-specific IFN-&gamma; producing CD8‚Å∫ T cells, and immunityfrom tumor re-challenge. The combination of PD-1 blockade and RV appears to be anefficacious immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of BrCa, and warrantsfurther investigation in early-phase clinical trials.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10060205 PMCID: PMC6025420PMID: 29914097
