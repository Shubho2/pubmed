Initiallyused by French and German radiologists, it illustrated the risk ofradiation-induced (RI) skin reactions. From the 1950s, 'radiosensitivity' wasprogressively found to describe other features of RI response such as RI cancers or cataracts. To date, such confusion may raise legal issues and complexify themessage addressed to general public. Here, through an historical review, we aimedto better understand how this confusion appeared.METHODS: To support our historical review, a quantitative and qualitative wordinganalysis of the 'radiosensitivity' occurrences and its derived terms wasperformed with Google books, Pubmed, Web of Science™ databases, and in all theICRP publications.CONCLUSIONS: While 'radiosensitivity' was historically related to RI adversetissue events attributable to cell death, the first efforts to quantify the RIrisk specific to each organ/tissue revealed some different semantic fields thatare not necessarily compatible together (e.g. adverse tissue events for skin,cataracts for eyes, RI cancer for breast or thyroid). To avoid such confusion, wepropose to keep the historical definition of 'radiosensitivity' to any clinicaland cellular consequences of radiation attributable to cell death and tointroduce the term 'radiosusceptibility' to describe the RI cancers or anyfeature that is attributable to cell transformation.DOI: 10.1080/09553002.2018.1450535 PMID: 29533136
