Depletion ofPCBP1 is implicated in various carcinomas, but the underlying mechanism intumorigenesis remains elusive.METHODS: We performed a transcriptome-wide screen to identify novel bounding mRNAof PCBP1. The bind regions between PCBP1 with target mRNA were investigated byusing point mutation and luciferase assay. Cell proliferation, cell cycle,tumorigenesis and cell apoptosis were also evaluated in ovary and colon cancercell lines. The mechanism that PCBP1 affects p27 was analyzed by mRNA stabilityand ribosome profiling assays. We analyzed PCBP1 and p27 expression in ovary,colon and renal tumor samples and adjacent non-tumor tissues using RT-PCR,Western Blotting and immunohistochemistry. The prognostic significance of PCBP1and p27 also analyzed using online databases.RESULTS: We identified cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 (p27) as a novel PCBP1-bound transcript. We then demonstrated that binding of PCBP1 to p27 3'UTR via its KH1domain mainly stabilizes p27 mRNA, while enhances its translation to fuel p27expression, prior to p27 protein degradation. The upregulated p27 consequentlyinhibits cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, whereaspromotes cell apoptosis under paclitaxel treatment. Conversely, knockdown ofPCBP1 in turn compromises p27 mRNA stability, leading to lower p27 level andtumorigenesis in vivo. Moreover, forced depletion of p27 counteracts the tumorsuppressive ability of PCBP1 in the same PCBP1 over-expressing cells.Physiologically, we showed that decreases of both p27 mRNA and its proteinexpressions are well correlated to PCBP1 depletion in ovary, colon and renaltumor samples, independent of the p27 ubiquitin ligase Skp2 level. Correlation ofPCBP1 with p27 is also found in the tamoxifen, doxorubincin and lapatinibresistant breast cancer cells of GEO database.CONCLUSION: Our results thereby indicate that loss of PCBP1 expression firstlyattenuates p27 expression at post-transcriptional level, and subsequentlypromotes carcinogenesis. PCBP1 could be used as a diagnostic marker to cancerpatients.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0840-1 PMID: 30086790
