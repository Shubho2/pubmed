CTCF can undergo a number of post-translational modifications whichchange its properties and functions. One such modifications linked to cancer ispoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). The highly PARylated CTCF form has anapparent molecular mass of 180 kDa (referred to as CTCF180), which can bedistinguished from hypo- and non-PARylated CTCF with the apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa (referred to as CTCF130). The existing data accumulated so far havebeen mainly related to CTCF130. However, the properties of CTCF180 are not wellunderstood despite its abundance in a number of primary tissues. In this study weperformed ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses in human breast cells 226LDM, whichdisplay predominantly CTCF130 when proliferating, but CTCF180 upon cell cyclearrest. We observed that in the arrested cells the majority of sites lost CTCF,whereas fewer sites gained CTCF or remain bound (i.e. common sites). Theclassical CTCF binding motif was found in the lost and common, but not in thegained sites. The changes in CTCF occupancies in the lost and common sites wereassociated with increased chromatin densities and altered expression from theneighboring genes. Based on these results we propose a model integrating theCTCF130/180 transition with CTCF-DNA binding and gene expression changes. Thisstudy also issues an important cautionary note concerning the design andinterpretation of any experiments using cells and tissues where CTCF180 may bepresent.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
