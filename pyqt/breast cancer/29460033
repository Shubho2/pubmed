This study aims to determine indicators ofprognosis, including primary tumor resection, for stage IV IBC patients.METHODS: Using the National Cancer Data Base, female patients diagnosed 2010-2013with unilateral a priori metastatic T4d invasive adenocarcinoma of the breastwere identified. We conducted propensity score matched analysis to balanceconfounders of surgery versus no-surgery. Stratified log-rank test anddouble-robust estimation under the Cox model were used to assess the effect ofsurgery, and margins, on overall survival (OS) in the propensity score matchedcohort.RESULTS: Of 1266 patients, 41% underwent surgery. In the unmatched cohort, medianOS of the surgery and no-surgery groups was 36 and 20 months, respectively(p < 0.001). In the matched cohort (n = 588), the median OS of surgery andno-surgery groups was 29 and 27 months, respectively (p = 0.052). Patients withnegative margin surgery (p = 0.024), hormone receptor-positive (p = 0.019),HER2-positive disease (p < 0.0001), treated with chemotherapy (p < 0.0001) andhormonal therapy (p < 0.0001), had better survival. Those with brain metastaseshad increased risk of death (p < 0.0001).CONCLUSION: This study represents the largest cohort of metastatic IBC patients, and identified negative margin surgery, systemic therapy, hormone receptor andHER2-positive disease as factors associated with improved outcomes. While thesefindings should be interpreted cautiously, they may be used to guide furtherinvestigations into local control and quality of life in this patient population with limited treatment options.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4715-0 PMID: 29460033
