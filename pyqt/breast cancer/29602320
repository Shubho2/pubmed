CIPN can persist from months to years after completion of chemotherapy, decreasingquality of life for cancer survivors. The aim of this study was to explore theincidence and risk factors of persistent CIPN among women with breast cancerreceiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.METHODS: In this prospective study, we recruited women with breast cancerreceiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including four cycles of docetaxel.Participants reported neuropathic symptoms of tingling/numbness at baseline, atthe end of chemotherapy treatment, and at 8 months after completion ofchemotherapy. Candidate factors associated with CIPN were assessed beforechemotherapy.RESULTS: Among 111 participants, 50 (45.0%) experienced CIPN during chemotherapy,and 21 (18.9%) reported persistent CIPN after chemotherapy. Univariate logisticregression analysis revealed that development of CIPN was significantlyassociated with pre-treatment numbness (odds ratio [OR], 4.02; 95% confidenceinterval [CI], 1.09-7.40; p = .033), and persistent CIPN was significantlyassociated with pre-treatment numbness (OR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.12-11.61; p = .032)and pre-treatment anxiety (OR, 5.02; 95% CI, 1.84-13.70; p = .002). Multivariate analysis indicated that pre-treatment anxiety remained significantly associatedwith persistent CIPN (OR, 4.01; 95% CI, 1.25-12.87; p = .020).CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that pre-treatment anxiety might be related to a patient's risk for persistent CIPN in women with breast cancer undergoingneoadjuvant chemotherapy. Further research is required to investigate ifinterventions targeting pre-treatment anxiety could provide prevention andmanagement for persistent CIPN.Copyright © 2018.
