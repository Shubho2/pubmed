A retrospective analysis was conducted in Fudan UniversityShanghai Cancer Center. According to histological type, patients with benign PTBswere classified as a low-risk group, while borderline and malignant PTBs wereclassified as a high-risk group. The Cox regression model was adopted to identifyfactors affecting postoperative RFS in the two groups, and a nomogram wasgenerated to predict recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years. Among the 404patients, 168 (41.6%) patients had benign PTB, 184 (45.5%) had borderline PTB,and 52 (12.9%) had malignant PTB. Fifty-five patients experienced postoperativelocal recurrence, including six benign cases, 26 borderline cases, and 22malignant cases; the three histological types of PTB had local recurrence ratesof 3.6%, 14.1%, and 42.3%, respectively. Stromal cell atypia was an independentprognostic factor for RFS in the low-risk group, while the surgical approach and tumor border were independent prognostic factors for RFS in the high-risk group, and patients receiving simple excision with an infiltrative tumor border had ahigher recurrence rate. A nomogram developed based on clinicopathologic features and surgical approaches could predict recurrence-free survival at 1, 3, and5 years. For high-risk patients, this predictive nomogram based on tumor border, tumor residue, mitotic activity, degree of stromal cell hyperplasia, and atypiacan be applied for patient counseling and clinical management. The efficacy ofadjuvant radiotherapy remains uncertain.© 2018 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/cam4.1327 PMCID: PMC5911599PMID: 29479819
