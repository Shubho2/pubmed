MBS301consists of two half antibodies engineered from trastuzumab and pertuzumab,respectively. Integrity and purity profiles of MB301 indicated that theheterodimerization of the two half antibodies was successful. The high andsimilar melting temperatures (Tm1,72.0°C and Tm2, 84.8°C) of MBS301 compared withthose of its parental monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab (in-house made T-mab and P-mab, respectively) revealed its structural compactness. Withcomputer-modeling experiments and Biacore binding and competition kineticsstudies, the binding stoichiometry between MBS301 and HER2-ECD was determined to be 1:1 and the two arms of MBS301 were shown to bind to domains II and IV ofHER2-ECD antigen simultaneously. MBS301 displayed synergistic bioactivities asthe combination of T-mab and P-mab in vitro in multiple cancer cell lines and in vivo in xenograft mouse model studies, and showed more effective activity thanT-mab or P-mab used individually. Moreover, fucose-knockout dramaticallyincreased MBS301's binding affinity to low affinity FcγRIIIa allotype 158F(KD = 2.35 × 10-7M) to near the high affinity level of allotype V158(KD = 1.17 × 10-7M). This resulted in far more effective ADCC activity of MBS301 than the combination of T-mab and P-mab in killing HER2-positive cancer cells.Hence, a novel fully afucosylated anti-HER2 bispecific antibody with improvedantitumor activities was generated and shown to have the potential to be used fortreating HER2-positive but trastuzumab-resistant solid tumors.DOI: 10.1080/19420862.2018.1486946 PMID: 30081724
