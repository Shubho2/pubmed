Electronic address: xinguangqiu001@163.com.Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been demonstrated as essential regulatorsin human cancers. However, the function and mechanism of circRNAs in breastcancer (BC) remain largely unknown and require to be investigated. In the presentstudy, we found that circMYO9B was highly expressed in BC tissues bybioinformatics analysis. And we showed that circMYO9B expression was positivelycorrelated with patients' prognosis. Moreover, we found that circMYO9B knockdown significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of BC cells invitro. In vivo assays also indicated that circMYO9B silence delayed tumor growth.In mechanism, we found that circMYO9B promoted the expression of FOXP4 bysponging miR-4316 in BC cells. We showed that the expression of miR-4316 wasinversely associated with that of circMYO9B or FOXP4 in BC tissues. Finally, wefound that restoration of FOXP4 expression significantly reversed the effects of circMYO9B knockdown on BC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Inconclusion, our findings demonstrated a key role of circMYO9B/miR-4316/FOXP4 axisin regulating BC progression.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
