[Epub ahead of print]Amplified Crosstalk Between Estrogen Binding and GFR Signaling Mediated Pathways of ER Activation Drives Responses in Tumors Treated with Endocrine Disruptors.Suba Z(1).Author information: (1)National Institute of Oncology, Department of Molecular Pathology, Address:H-1122, Ráth György str. 7-9, Budapest. Hungary.BACKGROUND: The pharmaceutical development of endocrine disruptors could notachieve appropriate advances in the field of anticancer fight.OBJECTIVE: Considerations on the principles of currently used endocrinetherapies.METHODS: Comparison of the results of genetic studies being performed on breastcancer cells treated with estrogens, synthetic estrogens and antiestrogens.RESULTS: In breast cancer cells, increased estrogen concentrations amplifyER-signaling via a synergistic upregulation of both liganded and unligandedER-activations and increased aromatase expression. The higher the upregulation ofER-signaling, the stronger is the tumor response. Low doses of syntheticestrogens exert an inhibition on the ligand-independent AF1-domain in breastcancer cells, while provoke compensatory activation on the superior,ligand-dependent AF2-domain of ERs and estrogen synthesis. Conversely, high dosesof synthetic estrogens induce uncompensated genome-wide disruption inER-regulated genes leading to toxic symptoms and unpredictable tumor responses.Treatment with antiestrogens, either ER-blockers or aromatase inhibitors,obstructs the crucial AF2-domain of ERs strongly deteriorating the activation of genomic machinery. Tumor responses to antiestrogen treatment depend on thecompensatory activation of ER-signaling and the restoration of genomic stability.Recent patents provide methods for the conversion of ER-negative cancers toER-positive ones improving the possibility of successful treatment.CONCLUSION: In tumor cells, the stabilization of genomic machinery andself-directed death may be achieved via a balanced activation of the AF1 and AF2 domains of ERs by natural estrogen treatment. In contrast, the blockade of eitherAF1 or AF2 domain by endocrine disruptors leads to toxic symptoms andunforeseeable tumor responses.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1574892813666180720123732 PMID: 30027855
