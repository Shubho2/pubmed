We describe a58-year-old woman with previous breast cancer and statin use who complained ofrapidly progressive weakness of lower limbs without pain, making walking, runningand climbing stairs difficult. The creatine kinase level was 2,843 U/L, andmuscle biopsy showed a dystrophic pattern. The genetic test for musculardystrophies was negative and for anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme Areductase was positive. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered, which showedmild improvement. Unfortunately, she took a step and collapsed to the floor,which led to the fracture of right femur delaying her improvement. The diagnosis of necrotizing autoimmune myopathy is sometimes delayed due to the atypicalpathologic findings on muscle biopsy. As the disease is a severe condition,prompt recognition can lead to a successful outcome. We advise to consider thisentity as a differential diagnosis among muscular dystrophies.DOI: 10.2147/TCRM.S162931 PMCID: PMC5957055PMID: 29785116
