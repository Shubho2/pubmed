We hypothesizedquantifying key immunosuppression mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment bymultiparameter algorithms would identify strong predictors of anti-PD1 response.METHODS: Pre-treatment tumor biopsies from 166 patients treated with anti-PD-1across 10 academic cancer centers were fluorescently stained with multiplemarkers in discovery (n = 24) and validation (n = 142) cohorts. Biomarkerpositive cells and their co-localization were spatially profiled inpathologist-selected tumor regions using novel Automated Quantitative Analysis(AQUA) algorithms. Selected biomarker signatures, PD-1/PD-L1 interaction scoreand IDO-1/HLA-DR co-expression were evaluated for anti-PD-1 treatment outcomes.RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, PD-1/PD-L1 interaction score and/orIDO-1/HLA-DR co-expression was strongly associated with anti-PD-1 response (P =.0005). In contrast, individual biomarkers (PD-1, PD-L1, IDO-1, HLA-DR) were not associated with response or survival. This finding was replicated in anindependent validation cohort: patients with high PD-1/PD-L1 and/or IDO-1/HLA-DR were more likely to respond (P = .0096). These patients also experiencedsignificantly improved progression free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.36; P = .0004) and overall survival (OS; HR = 0.39; P = .0011). In the combinedcohort, 80% of patients exhibiting higher levels of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction scoresand IDO-1/HLA-DR responded to PD-1 blockers (P = .000004). In contrast, PD-L1expression was not predictive of survival.CONCLUSION: Quantitative spatial profiling of key tumor-immune suppressionpathways by novel digital pathology algorithms could help more reliably selectmelanoma patients for PD-1 monotherapy.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0309 PMID: 30021908
