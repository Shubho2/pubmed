In order to identify the mechanism of TAM resistance for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, we screened the transcriptome using RNA-seqand compared the gene expression profiles between the MCF-7 mamma carcinoma cell line and the TAM-resistant cell line TAMR/MCF-7, 52 significant differentialexpression genes (DEGs) were identified including SLIT2, ROBO, LHX, KLF, VEGFC,BAMBI, LAMA1, FLT4, PNMT, DHRS2, MAOA and ALDH. The DEGs were annotated in theGO, COG and KEGG databases. Annotation of the function of the DEGs in the KEGGdatabase revealed the top three pathways enriched with the most DEGs, includingpathways in cancer, the PI3K-AKT pathway, and focal adhesion. Then we comparedthe gene expression profiles between the Clinical progressive disease (PD) andthe complete response (CR) from the cancer genome altas (TCGA). 10 common DEGswere identified through combining the clinical and cellular analysis results.Protein-protein interaction network was applied to analyze the association of ER signal pathway with the 10 DEGs. 3 significant genes (GFRA3, NPY1R and PTPRN2)were closely related to ER related pathway. These significant DEGs regulated manybiological activities such as cell proliferation and survival, motility andmigration, and tumor cell invasion. The interactions between these DEGs and drug resistance phenomenon need to be further elucidated at a functional level infurther studies. Based on our findings, we believed that these DEGs could betherapeutic targets, which can be explored to develop new treatment options.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23694 PMCID: PMC5790522PMID: 29423105
