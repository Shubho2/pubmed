The microwave breast image quality is affected by themicrowave sensor, sensor array, the number of sensors in the array and the sizeof the sensor. In fact, microwave sensor array and sensor play an important role in the microwave breast imaging system. Numerous microwave biosensors have beendeveloped for biomedical applications, with particular focus on breast tumordetection. Compared to the conventional medical imaging and biosensor techniques,these microwave sensors not only enable better cancer detection and improve theimage resolution, but also provide attractive features such as label-freedetection. This paper aims to provide an overview of recent importantachievements in microwave sensors for biomedical imaging applications, withparticular focus on breast cancer detection. The electric properties ofbiological tissues at microwave spectrum, microwave imaging approaches, microwavebiosensors, current challenges and future works are also discussed in themanuscript.DOI: 10.3390/s18020655 PMCID: PMC5854976PMID: 29473867  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
