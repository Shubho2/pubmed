While early detection and improved treatment have led toreduced mortality, even for those with metastatic cancer, some patients stillrespond poorly to treatment. Understanding the mechanisms of metastasis isimportant to improve prognostication, to stratify patients for treatment, and to identify new targets for therapy. We have shown previously that expression ofnephronectin (NPNT) is correlated with metastatic propensity in breast cancercell lines. In the present study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of theexpression pattern and distribution of NPNT in breast cancer tissue from 842patients by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays from a historiccohort. Several patterns of NPNT staining were observed. An association betweengranular cytoplasmic staining (in <10% of tumor cells) and poor prognosis wasfound. We suggest that granular cytoplasmic staining may represent NPNT-positive exosomes. We found that NPNT promotes adhesion and anchorage-independent growthvia its integrin-binding and enhancer motifs and that enforced expression inbreast tumor cells promotes their colonization of the lungs. We propose that NPNTmay be a novel prognostic marker in a subgroup of breast cancer patients.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
