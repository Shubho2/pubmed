Through thiscensus-based study, we aimed to quantify disparities in mortality acrossoccupation-based social classes in Italy.METHODS: We conducted a historical cohort study on a sample of more than 16million workers. We estimated the mortality rate ratios for each social class,considering upper non-manual workers as reference.RESULTS: Non-skilled manual workers showed an increased mortality from upperaero-digestive tract, stomach and liver cancers, and from diseases of thecirculatory system, transport accidents and suicides in both sexes, and frominfectious diseases, diabetes, lung and bladder cancers only in men. Among women,an excess mortality emerged for cervical cancer, whereas mortality from breastand ovarian cancers was lower. When education was taken into account, the excess mortality decreased in men while was no longer significant in women.CONCLUSIONS: There are remarkable disparities across occupation-based socialclasses in the Italian working population that favour the upper non-manualworkers. Our data could be useful in planning policies for a more effectivehealth and social security system.DOI: 10.1007/s00038-018-1149-8 PMID: 30051314
