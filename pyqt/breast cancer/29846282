Thus, the cause of most fluorouracil toxicity cases remains unexplained.METHODS: For this small cohort study, thymine (THY) 250 mg was administeredorally to 6 patients who had experienced severe toxicity during treatment with5FU or capecitabine. Plasma and urine were analyzed for THY and its catabolitesdihydrothymine (DHT) and Î²-ureidoisobutyrate.RESULTS: Of the 6 patients, 2 had decreased THY elimination and raised urinaryTHY recovery consistent with inherited partial dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenasedeficiency, confirmed by DPYD sequencing. Unexpectedly, 3 patients displayedgrossly raised plasma THY concentrations but normal elimination profiles(compared with a normal range for healthy volunteers previously published by the authors). DPYD and DPYS sequencing of these 3 patients did not reveal anysignificant loss-of-activity allelic variants. The authors labeled the phenotype in these 3 patients as "enhanced thymine absorption". Only 1 of the 6 cases oftoxicity had a normal postdose plasma profile for THY and its catabolites.Postdose urine collections from all 6 patients had THY/DHT urinary ratios above4.0, clearly separated from the ratios in healthy subjects that were all below3.0.CONCLUSIONS: This small cohort provided evidence for a hypothesis thatfluorouracil toxicity cases may include a previously undescribed pyrimidineabsorption variant, "enhanced thymine absorption," and elevated THY/DHT ratios inurine may predict fluorouracil toxicity. A prospective study is currently beingconducted.DOI: 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000532 PMID: 29846282
