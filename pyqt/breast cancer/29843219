[Epub ahead of print]The clinicopathological and prognostic significances of Dkk3 expression incancers: A bioinformatics analysis.Chen GY, Zheng HC.BACKGROUND: Dkk3 protein attenuates the expression of Wnt3a, Wnt5a and LRP6, and their interaction, and interacts with βTrCP to suppress wnt/β-catenin pathway.METHODS: We performed a bioinformatics analysis of Dkk3 mRNA expression throughOncomine, TCGA and Kaplan-Meier databases up to July 10, 2017.RESULTS: Up-regulated Dkk3 expression was higher in gastric, breast, and ovarian cancers than normal tissues (p< 0.05). Bitter's database showed a higher Dkk3expression in ovarian cytoadenocarcinoma than clear cell adenocarcinoma (p<0.05). Dkk3 was more expressed in ductal breast cancer in situ than invasiveductal breast cancer (p< 0.05), in mixed lobular and ductal cancer, and lobularcancer than ductal breast cancer (p< 0.05). In TCGA data, Dkk3 expression waslower in gastric cancers with than without Barret's esophagus (p< 0.05), and inthe cancers of elder than younger patients (p< 0.05). Dkk3 expression was higher in squamous cell carcinoma than adenocarcinoma (p< 0.05). Dkk3 expression washigher in ductal than lobular breast cancer, or in younger than elder patientswith breast cancer (p< 0.05). According to Kaplan-Meier plotter, Dkk3 expression was negatively correlated with overall, progression-free, relapse-free ordistant-metastasis-free survival rate of gastric, breast or ovarian cancerpatients, but versa for lung cancer patients (p< 0.05).CONCLUSION: Dkk3 expression might be employed as a potential marker to indicatecarcinogenesis and histogenesis, even prognosis.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-181245 PMID: 29843219
