How often there-excision yields additional cancer and whether there are predictors of residualdisease remain unknown.STUDY DESIGN: Patients who had a positive margin (defined as tumor at ink forpatients with invasive disease or within 1 mm for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ) in the SHAVE (A Randomized Controlled Trial of Routine Shave MarginsVersus Standard Partial Mastectomy in Breast Cancer Patients) trial beforerandomization were evaluated to determine the rate of additional disease eitherin cavity shave margins or at re-excision. Details of the SHAVE trial can befound elsewhere.RESULTS: Of the 235 patients in the trial, 82 (34.9%) had a positive marginbefore randomization; 58 of these patients underwent either cavity shave margins excision or a re-excision of the positive margin(s). Twenty-one (36.2%) patients had residual disease. On bivariate analysis, residual disease was associated withyounger patient age (median 51 vs 62 years; p = 0.007), and the presence ofhigh-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (57.1% vs 31.3% for grade 2 and 0% for grade 1; p = 0.025). The following factors were not associated with further disease:patient race; ethnicity; BMI; volume of resection; number of positive margins;extent of ductal carcinoma in situ; and extent, grade, and histologic subtype of invasive cancer. On multivariate analysis, only patient age younger than 60 yearsremained a significant predictor of residual disease (odds ratio 3.920; 95% CI1.081 to 14.220; p = 0.038).CONCLUSIONS: Positive margins are associated with further disease in more thanone-third of patients and, aside from young age, there are no predictors of this.These findings support continued re-excision of positive margins, particularly inpatients younger than 60 years of age.Copyright © 2018 American College of Surgeons.
