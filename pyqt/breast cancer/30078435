Electronic address: dalessid@mskcc.org.PURPOSE: To determine the effect of subspecialty review of breast imaging onpatients without a diagnosis of breast cancer who self-referred for a secondopinion.METHODS: Institutional review board-approved retrospective review was performedof 415 breast imaging studies submitted to our cancer center for second-opinionreview by 245 patients in 2014, excluding cases without follow-up or change inoriginal BI-RADS 0 assessment. One hundred forty-seven patients with 176 lesions were included. Original and second-opinion interpretations and recommendationswere compared with histopathology or follow-up imaging.RESULTS: Ninety-six of 176 (55%) lesions were reported as suspicious in theoriginal interpretation. Second-opinion review was discordant with the originalinterpretation in 82 of 176 (47%) lesions. Second-opinion review downgraded 24 of96 (25%) lesions originally reported as suspicious to benign or probably benign, averting biopsy of these lesions. Second-opinion review upgraded 31 of 80 (39%)lesions originally reported as benign or probably benign to suspicious. A totalof 87 lesions were biopsied yielding malignancy in 23 (26%) biopsies.Twenty-eight of 87 (32%) biopsies performed were recommended after second-opinionreview, with 8 of 28 (29%) of these biopsies yielding cancer. Eight of 23 (35%)cancers detected represented malignancy not initially detected in the originalinterpretation.CONCLUSION: Second-opinion review is valuable in patients pursuing a breastimaging specialist's opinion, even before they are diagnosed with breast cancer. Second-opinion review disagreed with the original interpretation for 47% oflesions, averted 25% of originally recommended biopsies, and detected cancer in29% of additional biopsies recommended. Thirty-five percent of cancers diagnosed after second-opinion review were not initially detected in the originalinterpretation.Copyright Â© 2018 American College of Radiology.
