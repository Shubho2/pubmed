Inthis study, we performed a small-scale screening of a library of compounds thattarget epigenetic regulators in paired EBV-positive and EBV-negative NPC celllines. We found that bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor JQ1preferentially inhibits the growth of EBV-positive NPC cells. JQ1 inducesapoptosis, decreases cell proliferation and enhances the radiosensitivity in NPC cells, especially EBV-positive cells. Significantly, JQ1-induced cell death isc-Myc-dependent. Notably, RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that JQ1 represses TP63, TP53 and their targets. JQ1 also lessens the expression of PD-L1 in NPC.Moreover, the high potency of JQ1 in NPC cells was further confirmed in vivo inCNE2-EBV+ tumor-bearing mice. These findings indicate that JQ1 is a promisingtherapeutic candidate for advanced NPC.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0789-1 PMCID: PMC6037792PMID: 29988031
