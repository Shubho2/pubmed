QoL and religiosity were measured with the Short Form-36 questionnaire and MuslimReligiosity questionnaire based on the Glock and Stark model, respectively. Data were analyzed using a software program for descriptive statistics, the Chi-squaretest, Pearson's correlation, and an independent sample t-test.Results: Most patients had high religiosity (69%) and moderate QoL (46.5%)scores. Total scores and all subscales scores for QoL were significantly higherin patients with high religiosity than patients with moderate religiosity (P <0.0001). Moreover, a direct correlation was found between religiosity (total and all subscales) and QoL (total and all subscales) (P < 0.0001).Conclusions: A significant relationship was found between religiosity and QoL in patients with breast cancer. Accordingly, care team members, especially midwiferyand nursing staff, should pay more attention to religious beliefs among thesepatients to improve their QoL.DOI: 10.4103/apjon.apjon_65_17 PMCID: PMC5863432PMID: 29607383
