Wecompared RS results among patients with lymph node-negative (N0), micrometastatic(N1mi), and macrometastatic (N+) breast cancer to determine if nodal metastasesare associated with more aggressive biology, as determined by RS.METHODS: Overall, 610,350 tumor specimens examined by the Genomic Healthlaboratory from February 2004 to August 2017 were studied. Histology wasclassified centrally, while lymph node status was determined locally. RSdistribution (low: < 18; intermediate: 18-30; high: ≥ 31) was compared by nodalstatus.RESULTS: Eighty percent (n = 486,013) of patients were N0, 4% (n = 24,325) wereN1mi, 9% (n = 56,100) were N+, and 7% (n = 43,912) had unknown nodal status. MeanRS result was 18, 16.7, 17.3 and 18.9 in the N0, N1mi, N+, and unknown groups,respectively. An RS ≥ 31 was seen in 10% of N0 patients, 7% of N1mi patients, and8.0% of N+ patients. The likelihood of an RS ≥ 31 in N1mi and N+ patients varied with tumor histology, with only 2% of patients with classic infiltrating lobular cancer having an RS ≥ 31, versus 7-9% of those with ductal carcinoma.CONCLUSIONS: RS distribution among N0, N1mi, and N+ patients is similar,suggesting a spectrum of biology and potential chemotherapy benefit exists among node-negative and node-positive ER+/HER2- breast cancer patients. If RxPONDERdoes not show a chemotherapy benefit in N+ patients with a low RS result, ourfindings indicate that substantial numbers of patients could be spared the burdenof chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6598-z PMID: 29968028
