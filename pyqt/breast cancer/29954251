[Epub ahead ofprint]Functional role of circular RNAs in cancer development and progression.Ng WL(1), Mohd Mohidin TB(1), Shukla K(2).Author information: (1)a Institute of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science , University of Malaya , Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia.(2)b School of Science , Monash University Malaysia , Subang Jaya , Selangor ,Malaysia.Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large class of endogenously expressed non-codingRNAs formed by covalently closed loops through back-splicing. High throughputsequencing technologies have identified thousands of circRNAs with high sequence conservation and cell type specific expression in eukaryotes. CircRNAs playmultiple important roles in cellular physiology functioning as miRNA sponges,transcriptional regulators, RBP binding molecules, templates for proteintranslation, and immune regulators. In a clinical context, circRNAs expression iscorrelated with patient's clinicopathological features in cancers includingbreast, liver, gastric, colorectal, and lung cancer. Additionally, distinctproperties of circRNAs, such as high stability, exonuclease resistance, andexistence in body fluids, show promising role for circRNAs as molecularbiomarkers for tumor diagnosis, non-invasive monitoring, prognosis, andtherapeutic intervention. Therefore, it is critical to further understand themolecular mechanism underlying circRNAs interaction in tumors and the recentprogress of this RNA species in cancer development. In this review, we provide a detailed description of biological functions, molecular role of circRNAs indifferent cancers, and its potential role as biomarkers in a clinical context.DOI: 10.1080/15476286.2018.1486659 PMID: 29954251
