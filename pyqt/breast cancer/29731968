Wehere demonstrate that the blockade of the mevalonate pathway using theantilipidemic drug statins represses Akt activation following MEK inhibition and induces significant apoptosis when co-treated with CH5126766 or trametinib. Theseevents were clearly negated by the addition of mevalonate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, indicating that the protein geranylgeranylation is implicated inthe apoptotic resistance to MEK inhibitors. Furthermore, mechanistically, thecombined treatment of CH5126766 with statins upregulated TNF-relatedapoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which was dependent on inhibition of themevalonate pathway and is involved in apoptosis induction in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The present study not only revealed that the mevalonate pathwaycould be targetable to enhance the efficacy of MEK inhibitors, but also proposes that combinatorial treatment of MEK inhibitors with statins may be a promisingtherapeutic strategy to sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24696 PMCID: PMC5929411PMID: 29731968
