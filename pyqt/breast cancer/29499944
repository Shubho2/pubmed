However, antibodycombinations have their limitations, with high immunogenicity and high cost. Inthis study, we have developed a three-in-one nucleic acid aptamer-smallinterfering RNA (siRNA) chimera, which targets EGFR/HER2/HER3 in one molecule.This inhibitory molecule was constructed such that a single EGFR siRNA ispositioned between the HER2 and HER3 aptamers to create a HER2 aptamer-EGFRsiRNA-HER3 aptamer chimera (H2EH3). EGFR siRNA was delivered into HER2-expressingcells by HER2/HER3 aptamer-induced internalization. HER2/HER3 aptamers act asantagonist molecules for blocking HER2 and HER3 signaling pathways and also astumor-targeting agents for siRNA delivery. H2EH3 enables down-modulation of theexpression of all three receptors, thereby triggering cell apoptosis. In breastcancer xenograft models, H2EH3 is able to bind to breast tumors with highspecificity and significantly inhibits tumor growth via either systemic orintratumoral administration. Owing to low immunogenicity, ease of production, andhigh thermostability, H2EH3 is a promising therapeutic to supplement currentsingle HER inhibitors and may act as a treatment for HER2+ breast cancer withintrinsic or acquired resistance to current drugs.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).
