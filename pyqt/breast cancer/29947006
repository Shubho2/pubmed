Data were analyzed usingnonparametric statistics (SPSS version 24).RESULTS: Ninety-four of the 109 patients approached completed both surveys (86.2%response rate). Median patient age at the time of surgery was 49.5 (range 29-82);the survey was administered at a median of 14.2 months postoperatively (range0.3-192.1 months). Seventy-four patients (78.7%) had reconstruction, and 52patients (55.3%) chose to undergo contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Patientswho reported an above average overall body image perception on the BIBCQ tendedto be further out from their surgery than those who reported a below averageperception (median 20.9 vs. 8.1 months, respectively, p = 0.009). Patients whoreported above average QoL also tended to be further out from their surgerycompared with those with below average overall QoL (median 21.8 vs. 6.4 months,respectively, p = 0.004). Receipt of reconstruction, contralateral prophylacticmastectomy, disease stage, patient race, education, insurance type, income,marital status, employment status, and age at surgery did not significantlyaffect body image nor QoL in this cohort.CONCLUSIONS: Better body image perception and higher QoL were associated withbeing further out from surgery. These findings suggest that body image and QoLmay improve with time, as patients acclimatize to their "new normal."DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6606-3 PMID: 29947006
