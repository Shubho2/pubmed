However, the ability of metformin to induce autophagy and its role inbreast cancer cell death remains unclear. In this study, we exposed MCF-7 cellsto different concentrations of metformin (2.5, 5, and 10 mM) for 48 h, andmetformin-induced significant apoptosis in the MCF-7 cells. The expression levelsof CL-PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) and the ratio of BAX to BCL-2 weresignificantly increased. In addition to apoptosis, we showed that metforminincreased autophagic flux in MCF-7 cells, as evidenced by the upregulation ofLC3-II and downregulation of P62/SQSTM1. Moreover, pharmacological or geneticblocking of autophagy increased metformin-induced apoptosis, indicating acytoprotective role of autophagy in metformin-treated MCF-7 cells.Mechanistically, metformin-induced TFE3(Ser321) dephosphorylation activated TFE3 nuclear translocation and increased of TFE3 reporter activity, which contributed to lysosomal biogenesis and the expression of autophagy-related genes and,subsequently, initiated autophagy in MCF-7 cells. Importantly, we found thatmetformin triggered the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MCF-7cells. Furthermore, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, abrogated theeffects of metformin on TFE3-dependent autophagy. Notably, TFE3 expressionpositively correlated with breast cancer development and poor prognosis inpatients. Taken together, these data demonstrate that blocking ROS-TFE3-dependentautophagy to enhance the activity of metformin warrants further attention as atreatment strategy for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/10715762.2018.1485075 PMID: 29865970
