The type of mutations in the Indian populationthat cause this condition is largely unknown.Purpose: In this cohort, 79 randomized BC patients were screened for varioustypes of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations including frameshift, nonsense, missense,in-frame and splice site types.Materials and methods: The purified extracted DNA of each referral patient wassubjected to Sanger gene sequencing using Codon Code Analyzer and MutationSurveyor and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods with Ion torrent software, after appropriate care.Results: The data revealed that 35 cases were positive for BRCA1 or BRCA2 (35/79:44.3%). BRCA2 mutations were higher (52.4%) than BRCA1 mutations (47.6%). Fivenovel mutations detected in this study were p.pro163 frameshift, p.asn997frameshift, p.ser148 frameshift and two splice site single-nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs). Additionally, four nonsense and one in-frame deletion were identified, which all seemed to be pathogenic. Polymorphic SNPs contributed thehighest percentage of mutations (72/82: 87.8%) and contributed to pathogenic,likely pathogenic, likely benign, benign and variant of unknown significance(VUS). Young age groups (20-60 years) had a high frequency of germline mutations (62/82;75.6%) in the Indian population.Conclusion: This study suggested that polymorphic SNPs contributed a highpercentage of mutations along with five novel types. Younger age groups are proneto having BC with a higher mutational rate. Furthermore, the SNPs detected inexons 10, 11 and 16 of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were higher than those in other exons 2, 3and 9 polymorphic sites in two germline genes. These may be contributory for BCalthough missense types are known to be susceptible for cancer depending on thetype of amino acid replaced in the protein and associated with pathologic events.Accordingly, appropriate counseling and treatment may be suggested.DOI: 10.2147/TACG.S155955 PMCID: PMC5953318PMID: 29785135
