Electronic address:andrej.babic@unige.ch.Treatment of cancer cells by clinically approved hexyl ester of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA-Hex) induces accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in tumors. Thisallows fluorescence photodiagnosis (PD) of bladder cancer by blue lightillumination. However, PD of other cancers is hampered by acute toxicity of thecompound limiting its use to local applications. We have designed and synthesizeda new prodrug of ALA-Hex that tackles the stability-activity paradox ofamino-modified 5-ALA prodrugs. The glucuronide prodrug Glu-ALA-Hex demonstratesexcellent stability under physiological conditions and activation in the presenceof the target enzyme. β-glucuronidase-triggered release of 5-ALA is programmed toyield fluorescence in tumor environment with elevated β-glucuronidase activity, acharacteristic of many solid tumors. Glu-ALA-Hex produces similar levels offluorescence as ALA-Hex in breast cancer MCF7 cells in vitro but with much lower non-specific cell toxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
