Italy.AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The main purpose of our psycho-educational groups was tohelp women with breast cancer learn how to cope with the physical, emotional, andlifestyle changes associated with cancer as well as with medical treatments that can be painful and traumatic. With this study, we wanted to detect the effectsthat group action had on the women who participated in it.METHODS: We studied a total of 97 patients who participated in 13psycho-education groups. The whole sample was female patients who had breastcancer with no recurrence or metastases.RESULTS: All patients were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and DepressionScale (HADS) and the Body Image Scale (BIS). We found no significant effect onanxiety and body image for the brief psycho-educational group for women withbreast cancer in this study. It is possible to highlight a statistical difference(Table 3) and hence an improvement between the results of the HADS depressiontest at T0 (first evaluation at the first meeting) and T1 (retest in the finalmeeting).CONCLUSIONS: The tests did not show a significant effect on anxiety and bodyimage perception, but the patients reported that the psycho-educational group wasan important intervention for their life. Outcome measurement is more complex in psychosocial research because many variables come into play and each phase oftreatment is characterized by different types of problems for the patient:physical, relational and psychological aspects are involved.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1574887113666180409152025 PMID: 29629664
