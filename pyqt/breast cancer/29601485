Fewstudies consider their relationship with inflammatory activity. Voluntary facial expressions modify the autonomic activity and this may be useful in the hospital environment for clinical biopsychosocial assessment of pain. Methods: Thisresearch compared a BC survivors group under integral treatment (Oncology,Psychology, Nutrition) with a control group to assess the intensity of pain,behavioral interference, anxiety, depression, temperament-expression, angercontrol, social isolation, emotional regulation, and alexithymia and inflammatoryactivity, with salivary interleukin 6 (IL-6). Then, a psychophysiologicalevaluation through repeated measures of facial infrared thermal imaging (IRT) andhands in baseline-positive facial expression (joy)-negative facial expression(pain)-relaxation (diaphragmatic breathing). Results: The results showed changes in the IRT (p < 0.05) during the execution of facial expressions in the chin,perinasal, periorbital, frontal, nose, and fingers areas in both groups. Nodifferences were found in the IL-6 level among the aforementioned groups, but an association with baseline nasal temperature (p < 0.001) was observable. The BCgroup had higher alexithymia score (p < 0.01) but lower social isolation (p <0.05), in comparison to the control group. Conclusions: In the low- andmedium-concentration groups of IL-6, the psychophysiological interventionproposed in this study has a greater effect than on the high concentration group of IL-6. This will be considered in the design of psychological and psychosocial interventions for the treatment of pain.DOI: 10.3390/medicines5020030 PMCID: PMC6023480PMID: 29601485
