The Study Group (SG) underwent12 weeks of training, including three 60-min sessions of aerobic exercise andresistance training, and two sessions of flexibility training per week; eachflexibility exercise lasted 20 s and was performed in sets of three repetitions. The Control Group (CG) received only the standard hospital treatment.Participants were evaluated at the beginning of the study to establish a baselineand reevaluated at the end of 12 weeks.RESULTS: Patients in the SG showed a significant decrease in total pain points(p = 0.0047), pain intensity (p = 0.0082), and the extent to which paininterfered with their daily life (p = 0.0047). There was an increase in maximumoxygen uptake (p = 0.0001), flexibility (p = 0.0001), and strength on both sides (right p = 0.0001 and left p = 0.0008). No significant differences were observed in fatigue (p = 0.0953) or BMI (p = 0.6088).CONCLUSION: Combined training was effective in decreasing pain and increasing VO2max, flexibility and static strength in patients with breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03061773 .
