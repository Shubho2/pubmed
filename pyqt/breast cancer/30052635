The mechanisms of taxanechemoresistance in TNBC have not been well investigated. Our results illustrated C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) was significantly elevated duringtaxane-containing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with nonpathologiccomplete response. Furthermore, CCL20 promoted the self-renewal and maintenanceof breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) or breast cancer stem-like cells throughprotein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated activation of p65 nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, significantlyincreasing the frequency and taxane resistance of BCSCs. Moreover, CCL20-promotedNF-κB activation increased ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1(ABCB1)/multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) expression, leading to the extracellularefflux of taxane. These results suggested that chemotherapy-induced CCL20mediated chemoresistance via up-regulating ABCB1. In addition, NF-κB activationincreased CCL20 expression, forming a positive feedback loop between NF-κB andCCL20 pathways, which provides sustained impetus for chemoresistance in breastcancer cells. Our results suggest that CCL20 can be a novel predictive marker fortaxane response, and the blockade of CCL20 or its downstream pathway mightreverse the taxane resistance in breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.2005869 PMID: 30052635
