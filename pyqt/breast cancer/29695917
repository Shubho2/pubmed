The NationalSurgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol B27 (NSABP-B27) (four cycles of adriamycin and cyclophosphamide [AC] followed by four cycles of docetaxel) is a standard neoadjuvant regimen in our institution. In this study, we report theefficacy of adding trastuzumab to docetaxel in this regimen for high-risk humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early-stage disease.Patients and methods: Consecutive HER2-positive breast cancer patients treatedwith this regimen were included. Treatment was given at standard doses andschedules as reported in NSABP-B27. Trastuzumab was given with docetaxel and thencontinued for 1 year.Results: A total of 121 patients (mean age 45.4 years) were included. Themajority had high-risk features including large tumor size, positive axillarylymph nodes, and grade III disease. Three patients did not complete the plannedcycles of AC due to a lack of response. Eight (6.6%) patients missed at least onecycle of docetaxel. Following neoadjuvant therapy, 119 patients underwentsurgery, of whom 59 (49.6%) patients achieved pathological complete response. Theresponse was higher in node-negative patients (64.0 vs 45.7%; P=0.03) and inhormone receptor-negative disease patients (69.7 vs 41.9%; P=0.018).Breast-conserving surgery was performed in 21.5% of the patients. The mediandisease-free survival (DFS) for the whole group was not reached while the 3- and 5-year DFS rates were 84.2 and 74.1%, respectively.Conclusion: Trastuzumab added to the NSABP-B27 regimen is a unique combination.When used in high-risk patients, as in our study, outcomes similar to reporteddata were achieved without unexpected toxicities.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S151821 PMCID: PMC5905529PMID: 29695917
