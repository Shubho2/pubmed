Therefore, genesinvolved in the secretory pathway are essential for the cellular development and function. Recent scientific investigations show that ER and Golgi apparatus mayprovide a convenient drug target for cancer therapy. On the other hand, it isknown that abundantly expressed genes in different cellular organelles shareinterconnected pathways and co-regulate each other activities. The cross-talksamong these genes play an important role in signaling pathways, associated to theregulation of intracellular protein transport.RESULTS: In the present study, we device an integrated approach to understandthese complex interactions. We analyze gene perturbation expression profiles,reconstruct a directed gene interaction network and decipher the regulatoryinteractions among genes involved in protein transport signaling. In particular, we focus on expression signatures of genes involved in the secretory pathway ofMCF7 breast cancer cell line. Furthermore, network biology analysis delineatesthese gene-centric cross-talks at the level of specific modules/sub-networks,corresponding to different signaling pathways.CONCLUSIONS: We elucidate the regulatory connections between genes constitutingsignaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt, Ras, Rap1, calcium, JAK-STAT, EFGR and FGFR signaling. Interestingly, we determine some key regulatory cross-talks betweensignaling pathways (PI3K-Akt signaling and Ras signaling pathway) andintracellular protein transport.DOI: 10.1186/s12859-018-2036-2 PMCID: PMC5850946PMID: 29536825
