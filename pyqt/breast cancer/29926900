Since then, detection and treatment of breast cancer have improvedsubstantially and recent retrospective analyses point towards a survival benefit for less extensive breast surgery. Evidence for the association of such survival data with locoregional recurrence rates is largely lacking.METHODS: The Swedish Multicentre Cohort Study prospectively included clinicallynode-negative patients with breast cancer who had planned sentinel node biopsybetween 2000 and 2004. Axillary lymph node dissection was undertaken only inpatients with sentinel node metastases. For the present investigation, adjustedsurvival analyses were used to compare patients who underwent BCS andpostoperative radiotherapy with those who received mastectomy withoutradiotherapy.RESULTS: Of 3518 patients in the Swedish Multicentre Cohort Study, 2767 wereincluded in the present analysis; 2338 had BCS with postoperative radiotherapyand 429 had mastectomy without radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 156 months. BCSfollowed by whole-breast irradiation was superior to mastectomy withoutirradiation in terms of both overall survival (79·5 versus 64·3 per centrespectively at 13 years; P < 0·001) and breast cancer-specific survival (90·5versus 84·0 per cent at 13 years; P < 0·001). The local recurrence rate did notdiffer between the two groups. The axillary recurrence-free survival rate at13 years was significantly lower after mastectomy without irradiation (98·3versus 96·2 per cent; P < 0·001).CONCLUSION: The present data support the superiority of BCS with postoperativeradiotherapy over mastectomy without radiotherapy. The axillary recurrence ratediffered significantly, and could be one contributing factor in a complexexplanatory model.© 2018 The Authors.
