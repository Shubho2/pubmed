This situation requires a multidisciplinary approachinvolving obstetricians, oncologists and surgeons. In this review we analysediagnostic methods, different possible treatments and long-term patientprognosis. We conducted a search for articles published in PubMed, or in abstractform from the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), the European Societyfor Medical Oncology (ESMO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)annual meeting, using the search terms: "Breast cancer and pregnancy". Breastcancer occurring during pregnancy requires extra effort to offer patients thebest multidisciplinary management. There is no difference in the pathology-based classification, but breast cancer during pregnancy seems to be associated withdifferent patterns of gene expression. Chemotherapy and surgery are generallysafe and well-tolerated by patients during the second and third trimesters ofpregnancy. The poorer prognosis could be attributed mainly to a delay indiagnosis and because breast cancer in young patients is a more aggressivedisease. Finally, balancing the health of mother and child must be paramount.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2018.04.029 PMID: 29728277
