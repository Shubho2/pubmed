Thelack of targeted therapy and the elevated mortality evidence the need for better knowledge of the tumor biology. Hypoxia and aberrant glycosylation are associatedwith advanced stages of malignancy, tumor progression and treatment resistance.Importantly, serum deprivation regulates the invasive phenotype and favors TNBCcell survival. However, in TNBC, the role of hypoxia and serum deprivation in theregulation of glycosylation remains largely unknown. The effects of hypoxia andserum deprivation on the expression of glycosyltransferases and glycan profilewere evaluated in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. We showed that the overexpression of HIF-1α was accompanied by acquisition of epithelial-mesenchimal transitionfeatures. Significant upregulation of fucosyl- and sialyltransferases involved inthe synthesis of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens was observed togetherwith changes in fucosylation and sialylation detected by Aleuria aurantia lectin and Sambucus nigra agglutinin lectin blots. Bioinformatic analysis furtherindicated a mechanism by which HIF-1α can regulate ST3GAL6 expression and therelationship within the intrinsic characteristics of TNBC tumors. In conclusion, our results showed the involvement of hypoxia and serum deprivation inglycosylation profile regulation of TNBC cells triggering breast canceraggressive features and suggesting glycosylation as a potential diagnostic andtherapeutic target.DOI: 10.1515/hsz-2018-0121 PMID: 29894296
