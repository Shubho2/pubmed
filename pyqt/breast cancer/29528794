We examined the receipt of clinically indicated genetic counseling inthese patients. Patients and Methods We surveyed 5,080 patients between the ages of 20 and 79 years, diagnosed from July 2013 to August 2015 with early-stagebreast cancer and reported to the SEER registries of Georgia and Los AngelesCounty. Surveys were linked to SEER clinical data and genetic test results. Thestudy sample (N = 1,711) comprised patients with indications for formal geneticrisk evaluation. Results Overall, 47.4% did not get tested, 40.7% testednegative, 7.4% had a variant of uncertain significance only, and 4.5% had apathogenic mutation. Three quarters (74.6%) received some form of geneticcounseling (43.5%, formal counseling and 31.1%, physician-directed discussion).Virtually all tested patients (96.1%) reported some form of genetic discussion(62.2%, formal counseling and 33.9%, physician-directed discussion). However,only one half (50.6%) of those not tested received any discussion about genetics.Younger women were more likely to report some type of counseling, controlling forother factors: odds ratio, 4.5 (95% CI, 2.6 to 8.0); 1.9 (95% CI, 1.1 to 3.3);and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.3) for women younger than 50 years of age, 50 to 59years of age, and 60 to 69 years of age versus those 70 years of age and older.Patients' assessments of the amount of information they received about whether toget tested were similarly high whether they were counseled by a genetics expertor by a physician only (80.8% v 79.4% stated information was just right, P =.59). Conclusion Less than one half (43.5%) of patients with clinical indicationsreceived formal genetic counseling. There is a large gap between mandates fortimely pretest formal genetic counseling in higher-risk patients and the reality of practice today.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.76.2369 PMCID: PMC5908222 [Available on 2019-04-20]PMID: 29528794
