However, the role of Tn and STn in cancer and other diseases is not well understood. Our recent discoveryof the self-binding properties (carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions, CCIs) of Tn (Tn-Tn) and STn (STn-STn) provides a model for their possible roles incellular transformation. We also review evidence that Tn and STn are members of alarger family of glycan tumor antigens that possess CCIs, which may participatein oncogenesis.DOI: 10.1093/glycob/cwy032 PMCID: PMC6001880 [Available on 2019-04-03]PMID: 29618060
