Knowledge of its biodistribution pattern is essential to recognisephysiological variants. The aim of this study was to describe the physiologicdistribution of 18F-choline and pitfalls in patients with breast cancer. Methods Twenty-one consecutive patients with breast cancer (10 premenopausal and 11postmenopausal women; mean age, 52.82 ± 10.71 years) underwent 18F-cholinepositron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for staging.Whole-body PET/CT was acquired after 40 minutes of 18F-choline uptake. AcquiredPET images were measured semiquantitatively. Results All patients showed pitfallsunrelated to breast cancer. These findings were predominantly caused byphysiological glandular uptake in the liver, spleen, pancreas, bowels, axialskeleton (85%-100%), inflammation and benign changes (4.76%), appendicularskeleton (4.76%-19.049%), and site contamination (61.9%). In <1%, a concomitantmetastatic neoplasm was found. The breast showed higher physiological uptake inpremenopausal compared with postmenopausal woman (18F-choline maximumstandardised uptake values [g/dL] of the right breast = 2.04 ± 0.404 vs1.59 ± 0.97 and left breast = 2.00 ± 0.56 vs 1.93 ± 1.28, respectively).Conclusion 18F-choline uptake was higher in premenopausal women. Physiological18F-choline uptake was observed in many sites, representing possible pathologies.DOI: 10.1177/0300060518773019 PMID: 29781364
