Drug resistance is a common obstacle in TRAIL-based therapyfor TNBC. Calmodulin (CaM) is overexpressed in breast cancer. In this study, wecharacterized the novel function of CaM antagonist in enhancing TRA-8 inducedcytotoxicity in TRA-8 resistant TNBC cells and its underlying molecularmechanisms. Results demonstrated that CaM antagonist(s) enhanced TRA-8 inducedcytotoxicity in a concentration and time-dependent manner for TRA-8 resistantTNBC cells. CaM directly bound to DR5 in a Ca2+ dependent manner, and CaM siRNApromoted DR5 recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 for DISC formation and TRA-8activated caspase cleavage for apoptosis in TRA-8 resistant TNBC cells. CaMantagonist, trifluoperazine, enhanced TRA-8 activated DR5 oligomerization,DR5-mediated DISC formation, and TRA-8 activated caspase cleavage for apoptosis, and decreased anti-apoptotic pERK, pAKT, XIAP, and cIAP-1 expression in TRA-8resistant TNBC cells. These results suggest that CaM could be a key regulator to mediate DR5-mediated apoptotic signaling, and suggests a potential strategy forusing CaM antagonists to overcome drug resistance of TRAIL-based therapy forTRA-8 resistant TNBC.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcb.26848 PMCID: PMC5993614 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29663486
