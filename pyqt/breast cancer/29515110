Raddeanin A (RA), isolated fromtraditional Chinese herbs, is an oleanane-type triterpenoid saponin withanticancer potential. In this study, we investigated the effects of RA in breast cancer-induced osteolysis and elucidated the possible mechanisms involved in thisprocess. We first verified that RA could suppress osteoclast formation and boneresorption in vitro. Next, we confirmed that RA suppressed Ti-particle-inducedosteolysis in a mouse calvarial model, possibly through inhibition of the SRC/AKTsignaling pathway. A breast cancer-induced osteolysis mouse model furtherrevealed the positive protective effects of RA by micro-computed tomography andhistology. Finally, we demonstrated that RA inhibited invasion and AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Theseresults indicate that RA is an effective inhibitor of breast cancer-inducedosteolysis.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0417-0 PMCID: PMC5841366PMID: 29515110
