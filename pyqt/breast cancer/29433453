The cancer characteristicsof men with BRCA1/2 mutations are less well studied. This study describes theunique cancer characteristics of male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers at ourinstitution.METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review on male patients who were seenbetween January 2004 and December 2014 and tested positive for a BRCA1/2mutation. We evaluated clinical characteristics, pathology findings, treatmentselection and survival.RESULTS: A total of 102 male patients were identified who tested positive for aBRCA1/2 deleterious mutation. Of these 102 patients, 33 (32%) had a diagnosis of cancer. Of these 33 patients with cancer, the majority (20 patients) were foundto carry a BRCA2 mutation. Median age of cancer diagnosis was 65 years (Range:35-75 years). Of the 33 patients diagnosed with cancer, 8 had two or morecancers, including 1 patient who had 4 cancers. Prostate cancer was the mostcommonly diagnosed cancer, seen in 13 patients, 11 of whom were BRCA2 positive.These cancers tended to have higher Gleason scores and elevated PSA levels. Themajority of these prostate cancer patients were alive and disease free at amedian follow-up of 7.4 years. Male breast cancer was the second most commoncancer seen in 9 patients, all of whom were BRCA2 positive. The majority of thesecancers were high grade, hormone receptor positive and associated with lymph nodemetastases. There were no breast cancer related deaths. Other cancers includedbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma and other skin cancers.CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the cancer characteristics and outcomes of maleBRCA1/2 mutation carriers. A third of male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers had adiagnosis of cancer. A significant number of patients (mostly BRCA2 mutationpositive) developed multiple cancers, which may have important implications forcancer screening and prevention. Despite having high grade histology and advancedstage at diagnosis, male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with breast and prostatecancer demonstrated a favorable 5-year survival.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4098-y PMCID: PMC5809938PMID: 29433453
