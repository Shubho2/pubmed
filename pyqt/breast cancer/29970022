This study aimed to create a new TNM system to provide a reference forthe clinical diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer.METHODS: A review of gastric cancer patients' records was conducted in The First Hospital of China Medical University and the Liaoning Cancer Hospital andInstitute. Based on patients' prognoses data, computer-aided unsupervisedclustering was performed for all possible TNM staging situations to create a new staging division system.RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was 5-year survival, analyzed according toTNM classifications. Computer-aided unsupervised clustering for all TNM stagingsituations was used to create TNM division criteria that were more consistentwith clinical situations. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering for the number of lymph node metastasis in the N stage led to the formulation of a classificationmethod that differs from the existing N stage criteria, and unsupervisedclustering for tumor size provided an additional reference for prognosisestimates.CONCLUSIONS: Finally, we developed a TNM staging system based on thecomputer-aided unsupervised clustering method; this system was more in line with clinical prognosis data when compared with the 7th edition of UICC gastric cancerTNM classification.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4623-z PMCID: PMC6029135PMID: 29970022
