Electronic address:amandacy@163.com.Adriamycin (ADM) is a commonly used drug in clinical breast cancer treatment.However, some breast cancer types or breast cancers subjected to repeated ADMexposure develop strong resistance to ADM thus limiting its clinical efficacy. Inthis study, we found for the first time that toosendanin (TSN), a triterpenoidextracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Melia toosendan Sieb et Zucc,could successfully reverse adriamycin resistance in human breast cancer cells.Immunofluorescence and HPLC analysis demonstrated that TSN promoted adriamycinaccumulation in breast cancer cells, especially in the nucleus. Furthermore, TSN could significantly reduce ABCB1 expression. We then found that TSN was capableof suppressing adriamycin-induced Akt phosphorylation, probably due todownregulation of the PI3K catalytic subunits P110α and P110β, and inhibition of DNA-PKcs. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of TSN on PI3K P110α and P110βexpression was specifically observed in breast cancer cells but not in normalhuman cells. Moreover, TSN significantly potentiated the anti-cancer effect ofADM in the 4T1 breast cancer model and its inhibition rate was nearly 90%. Thus, TSN could be used as a novel PI3K inhibitor to reverse breast cancer resistance. The combination of ADM and TSN may represent a useful strategy for human breastcancer therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bcp.2018.03.022 PMID: 29574068
