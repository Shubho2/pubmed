Tumorgrowth, metastasis, vascular characteristics and immune cell properties wereanalyzed. Absence of Shb did not affect tumor growth although it increased lungmetastasis. Shb knockout mouse tumors showed decreased redness and less developedvascular plexa located at the periphery of the tumors. No difference in overalltumor vascular density, leakage or pericyte coverage was noted between thegenotypes although the average vessel size was smaller in the knockout. Tumorsinduced an increase of CD11b+ cells in spleen, lymph node, thymus, bone marrowand blood. Numbers of Shb knockout CD11b/CD8+ cells were decreased in lymph nodesand bone marrow of tumor bearing mice. Mice with tumors had reduced numbers ofCD4+ lymphocytes in blood/lymphoid organs, whereas in most of these locations theproportion of CD4+ cells co-expressing FoxP3 was increased, suggesting a relativeincrease in Treg cells. This finding was reinforced by increased bloodinterleukin-35 (IL-35) in wild type tumor bearing mice. Shb knockout blood showedin addition an increased proportion of IL-35 expressing Treg cells, supportingthe notion that absence of Shb further promotes tumor evasion from immune cellrecognition. This could explain the increased number of lung metastases observed under these conditions. In conclusion, 4T1 tumors alter immune cell responsesthat promote tumor expansion, metastasis and escape from T cell recognition in anShb dependent manner.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24643 PMCID: PMC5922350PMID: 29721156
