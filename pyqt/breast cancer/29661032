Therefore, weprimarily aimed to confirm our interventions' feasibility and secondarily aimedto affect upper-limb dysfunctions and fatigue.METHODS: Twenty-two breast cancer patients scheduled for radiotherapy wereallocated to an intervention (IG) or a passive control group (CG) as theypreferred. IG exercised 3×/week during 6 weeks of radiotherapy: cyclingendurance, handheld vibration, and balance training. We documented adverse eventsand training compliance (feasibility) and assessed the range of shoulder motion(ROM), isometric hand grip strength, vibration sense on the firstmetacarpophalangeal joint of the affected upper limb, and fatigue.RESULTS: We observed no adverse events and a training compliance of 98 %. IG'sROM improved significantly (abduction: 11°; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5 to 20;external rotation: 5°, 95% CI 0 to 10), as did the hand grip strength (1.6 kg,95% CI -0.6 to 3.1), while CG's ROM did not change. CG's vibration sense worsened(-1.0 points, 95% CI -1.5 to -0.5), while IG's remained stable. Changes ingeneral fatigue levels between IG (-2.0 points, 95% CI -3.0 to -1.0) and CG (0.5 points, 95% CI -1.0 to 4.5) revealed significant differences ( P = .008)Conclusions: Our intervention proved to be feasible and provides novel findings: it reduced fatigue levels and interestingly, handheld vibration exercisesimproved upper-limb function due to shoulder ROM, hand grip strength, andvibration sense.DOI: 10.1177/1534735418766615 PMID: 29661032
