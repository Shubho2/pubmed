Materials and Methods OA/UStechnology uses laser light to detect relative amounts of oxygenated anddeoxygenated hemoglobin in and around suspicious breast masses. In thisprospective, multicenter study, results of 209 patients with 215 breast massesclassified as BI-RADS 4a or 4b at US are reported. Patients were enrolled between2015 and 2016. Masses were first evaluated with US with knowledge of previousclinical information and imaging results, and from this information a USimaging-based probability of malignancy (POM) and BI-RADS category were assigned to each mass. The same masses were then re-evaluated at OA/US. During the OA/USevaluation, radiologists scored five OA/US features, and then reassigned anOA/US-based POM and BI-RADS category for each mass. BI-RADS downgrade and upgradepercentages at OA/US were assessed by using a weighted sum of the five OA featurescores. Results At OA/US, 47.9% (57 of 119; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57) of benign masses classified as BI-RADS 4a and 11.1% (three of 27; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.28) of massesclassified as BI-RADS 4b were correctly downgraded to BI-RADS 3 or 2. Two ofseven malignant masses classified as BI-RADS 4a at US were incorrectlydowngraded, and one of 60 malignant masses classified as BI-RADS 4b at US wasincorrectly downgraded for a total of 4.5% (three of 67; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.13)false-negative findings. Conclusion At OA/US, benign masses classified as BI-RADS4a could be downgraded in BI-RADS category, which would potentially decreasebiopsies negative for cancer and short-interval follow-up examinations, with the limitation that a few masses may be inappropriately downgraded.Â© RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018170500 PMID: 29664342
