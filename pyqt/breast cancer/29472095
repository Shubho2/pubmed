Dosecharacteristics of planning target volume and organs at risk were compared.RESULTS: The E-VMAT, TD and RA treatment plans had higher target coverage (V95%) than FinF plans (97.7-98.3% vs. 96.6%). The low-dose spillage to contralateralbreast and lung was smaller with FinF and TD (mean 0.1 and 0.3 Gy) compared toE-VMAT and RA (mean 0.6 and 0.9 Gy). E-VMAT, RA and TD techniques were moreeffective than FinF in sparing left anterior descending artery (mean 4.0, 4.2 and4.7 Gy vs. 6.1 Gy, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In whole breast irradiation TD, E-VMAT and RA plans generated inthis study achieved higher dose coverage and sparing of organs from the high dosein the vicinity of the PTV. The advantage of calculated FinF plans is the lowest dose on contralateral organs. The choice of the technique used should be weightedby each institution taking into account the dose characteristics of eachtechnique and its fit with patient anatomy bearing in mind the increased workloadof using modulated techniques and the increased beam on time.Copyright © 2017 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.
