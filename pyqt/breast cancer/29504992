Recently, NEK3 was reported to enhance themalignancy of breast cancer. However, its role in gastric cancer has not beencompletely characterized. In this study, we explored the prognostic significance of NEK3 in human gastric cancer. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot were performed to detect the NEK3 mRNA and protein expression in6 paired fresh human gastric cancer tissues and surrounding normal tissues. NEK3 levels in gastric cancer and its adjacent normal samples of 168 cases weredetected by immunohistochemistry, and the relationships between the NEK3 leveland various clinicopathological features were analyzed. NEK3 mRNA and proteinwere significantly overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues, compared withadjacent normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry staining assay showed thepercentage of high NEK3 expression in gastric cancer samples was higher than thatin adjacent normal samples. NEK3 overexpression was significantly correlated withpT stage, pathologic TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis ofgastric cancer. Cox multivariate regression analyses suggested that NEK3 was anindependent prognostic factor for survival of patients with gastric cancer. Thedata demonstrate that NEK3 is overexpressed in gastric cancer, which promotes themalignancy of gastric cancer. NEK3 may be as a prognostic biomarker and apotential therapeutic target for gastric cancer.Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors. Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
