We characterized a group ofvery young patients (≤ 35 years) for BRCA germline mutation and for somaticmutations in luminal (HER2 negative) breast cancer. Thirteen of 79 unselectedvery young patients were BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers. Of the non-BRCAtumors, eight with luminal subtype (HER2 negative) were submitted for whole exomesequencing and integrated with 29 luminal samples from the COSMIC database orprevious literature for analysis. We identified C to T single nucleotide variants(SNVs) as the most common base-change. A median of six candidate driver genes wasmutated by SNVs in each sample and the most frequently mutated genes were PIK3CA,GATA3, TP53 and MAP2K4. Potential cancer drivers affected in the present non-BRCAtumors include GRHL2, PIK3AP1, CACNA1E, SEMA6D, SMURF2, RSBN1 and MTHFD2. Sixteenout of 37 luminal tumors (43%) harbored SNVs in DNA repair genes, such as ATR,BAP1, ERCC6, FANCD2, FANCL, MLH1, MUTYH, PALB2, POLD1, POLE, RAD9A, RAD51 andTP53, and 54% presented pathogenic mutations (frameshift or nonsense) in at leastone gene involved in gene transcription. The differential biology of luminalearly-age onset breast cancer needs a deeper genomic investigation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25123 PMCID: PMC5976478PMID: 29854292
