Epub 2018 Apr12.A Scientific Basis for Humanae Vitae and Natural Law: The Role of HumanPheromones on Human Sexual Behavior Preferences by Oral Contraceptives and theAbortifacient Effects of Oral Contraceptives.Lanfranchi A(1).Author information: (1)Breast Cancer Prevention Institute, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA.This article will review Humanae Vitae's predictions of the effect of oralcontraceptives (the pill) on male-female relationships and societal behaviors. A scientific, biochemical basis underpinning these predictions is made. Evidence ofhuman pheromones will be given. Evidence for the changes in male and femalepheromones caused by the pill is given. Observational and experimental evidenceof changes in primate and human behaviors by pheromones is detailed. The rolethese changes have caused in attractiveness and selection of mate by both malesand females in preferences concerning major histocompatibility genes is examined.These changes have also resulted in societal changes in sexual behavior andfamily structure and have led to increased violence against women. Biochemicalevidence for the abortifacient properties of the pill is given. The use ofnatural family planning is given as a needed alternative to the harms of thepill. Summary: The human biological bases of Humanae Vitae's predictions of theeffect of the pill on male-female relationships are examined. Evidence of thepresence of pheromones in primates and humans is given. The pill changes humanpheromones, odors which are subconsciously detected. These pheromones causehumans to change what they find attractive in a mate. Choosing a mate while onthe pill can result in unstable and more violent unions. The biological basis forthe fact that the pill causes abortion of human embryos is given. A healthyalternative for fertility control is explained.DOI: 10.1177/0024363918756191 PMCID: PMC6056803 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 30046193
