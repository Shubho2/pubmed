The parental MDA-MB-231 cellswith luciferase served as the control group. Proliferation, migratorycapabilities and the cell cycle were evaluated. The tumorigenicity and thespontaneous pulmonary metastasis were measured in mice in vivo. In vivo imagingwas also performed. Histopathology, immunohistochemical analysis and microarrayprocessing were evaluated. Paired Student's t-test was used.RESULTS: The proliferation and migratory ability of FOXC1- MDA-MB-231 cells were enhanced significantly (p<0.05). Spontaneous pulmonary metastases were observedin 2 out of 5 mice, but no pulmonary metastases were observed in control animals.There were more FOXC1 cells in the G1 phase compared to the control (p<0.05), butthere were also significant reductions of cells in the S and G2 phases (p<0.05). The CD31 and endoglin (CD105) expression in the FOXC1 tumor was higher than inthe control, especially CD105 (p<0.05). The total fluorescence expressionquantity of FOXC1 was higher than in the control cells (p<0.05), and the apparentdiffusion coefficient (ADC) values were lower compared with the control (p<0.05).One pathway with the most gene enrichment (p38 MAPK signalling) may play a keyrole in regulating BLBC cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle andepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the interaction of relatedcritical regulatory genes (IL-6 and FOXC1).CONCLUSION: High FOXC1 enhanced the proliferation, migratory ability and EMT ofBLBC cells. This function may be regulated by IL-6 and FOXC1 through the p38 MAPKsignalling pathway.PMID: 30003742
