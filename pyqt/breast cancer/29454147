A literature search was performed in major databases and thegray literature using the terms polyps OR endometrial polyp AND endometrialneoplasms OR endometrial cancer OR endometrial hyperplasia OR malignan*. Studies describing the frequency of premalignant and malignant lesions in endometrialpolyps and any clinical or demographic factors associated with malignant lesions extracted using hysteroscopy were considered eligible. Independent investigators selected the studies and extracted the data. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model and meta-regression. We identified 37 studies (comprising 21,057 patients) of endometrial polyps. The prevalence of premalignant andmalignant lesions was 3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8-4.1; I2, 80.5%).Abnormal uterine bleeding (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.27-1.69; I2,82.4%), menopausal status (PR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.48-1.89; I2, 78.4%), age >60 years(PR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.84-3.16; I2, 81.5%), diabetes mellitus (PR, 1.76; 95% CI,1.43-2.16; I2, 0.0%), systemic arterial hypertension (PR, 1.50; 95% CI,1.20-1.88; I2, 75.9%), obesity (PR, 1.41; 95% CI:1.13-1.76; I2, 41.2%), andtamoxifen use (PR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.06-2.21; I2, 0.0%) were associated withendometrial polyp malignancy. However, breast cancer (PR, 0.83; 95% CI,0.44-1.57; I2, 0.0%), hormonal therapy (PR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.67-1.30; I2, 31.7%), parity (PR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.39-1.96; I2, 78.1%), and endometrial polyp size (PR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.70-1.57; I2, 44.7%) were not associated with malignancy ofendometrial polyps. Three of every 100 women with clinically recognized polyps, acondition associated with specific clinical and demographic factors, will harbor premalignant or malignant lesions.Copyright © 2018 American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists.
