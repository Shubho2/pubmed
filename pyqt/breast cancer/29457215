Epub 2018 Feb 19.The effect of anaesthetic technique during primary breast cancer surgery onneutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio and return to intendedoncological therapy.Ní Eochagáin A(1), Burns D(1), Riedel B(2), Sessler DI(3), Buggy DJ(4).Author information: (1)School of Medicine, Department of Anaesthesia, Mater University Hospital,University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.(2)Department of Cancer Anaesthesia and Pain Medicine, Peter MacCallum CancerCentre and University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.(3)Department of Outcomes Research, Anesthesiology Institute, Cleveland Clinic,Cleveland, OH, USA.(4)Mater University Hospital, School of Medicine, University College Dublin,Ireland, Outcomes Research, Consortium, Cleveland, OH, USA.Inflammation and immunosuppression contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer. Anincreased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio reflects these processes and is associated with adverse cancer outcomes. Whether anaesthetic technique for breast cancersurgery influences these factors, and potentially cancer recurrence, remainsunknown. We conducted a secondary analysis in patients enrolled in an ongoingtrial of anaesthetic technique on breast cancer recurrence. The primaryhypothesis was that postoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is lower inpatients allocated to receive propofol-paravertebral rather than inhalationalagent-opioid anaesthesia for primary breast cancer surgery. Among 397 patients,116 had differential white cell counts performed pre-operatively andpostoperatively. Pre-operative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was similar in thepropofol-paravertebral 2.3 (95%CI 1.8-2.8) and inhalational agent-opioidanaesthesia 2.2 (1.9-3.2) groups, p = 0.72. Postoperative neutrophil-lymphocyteratio was lower (3.0 (2.4-4.2) vs. 4.0 (2.9-5.4), p = 0.001) in thepropofol-paravertebral group. Propofol-paravertebral anaesthesia attenuated thepostoperative increase in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio.© 2018 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.DOI: 10.1111/anae.14207 PMID: 29457215
