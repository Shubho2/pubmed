Electronic address: Loic.josseran@aphp.fr.Tobacco consumption in France is still important. Several reasons explain this: agreat proximity between the State and the tobacco industry which allows animportant lobby up to the highest level of the State, valorization by the elites.Yet things change gradually. The image of tobacco is less positive and theepidemiology of consumption has changed since the early 2000s. While adultconsumption remains around 30% of daily smokers, youth consumption is steadilydecreasing (41% in 2000 vs. 25% in 2017). Another positive point is the decrease in the number of smokers among general practitioners, 1994: 34% vs. 16% in 2015. These points hide the current reality of smoking in France that kills 73,000people/year and lung cancer rates that literally explode in women. In 20 years,the incidence of lung cancer in women has increased from 5/10,000 people/year to 12/10,000 people years making lung cancer in women the leading cause of cancerdeaths from breast cancer. At the same time, men went from 50/10,000 to40/10,000. Finally, this health impact is responsible for a major financialimpact: the social cost of tobacco in France is estimated at € 120 billion ayear. Faced with these figures, the French policy to fight against tobacco hasbeen reinforced since 2016 with the adoption of the plain packet and asignificant increase in the price (+30% in 2 years).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
