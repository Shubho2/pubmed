Their effect on induction of apoptosis and their antioxidative activities were also evaluated. Six flavonoids induced cytotoxic effects in both cell lines.Luteolin had a marked effect on both cell lines, especially on HCT-116 cells(IC50 72h, 66.86μM). Also, luteolin was observed to have the highest apoptoticpotential after 72h treatment of examined cell lines (27.13% and 37.09%,respectively). Myricetin exhibited selective inhibition of cell growth (IC50114.75μM) and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells only. Luteolin and galanginexhibited prooxidative properties 24h after the treatment in HCT-116 cells, whilemyricetin induced prooxidative effects in MDA-MB-231 cells. On the other hand,selected flavonoids exhibited antioxidative properties 72h after the treatment,decreasing superoxide anion radical and nitrite levels in both cell lines.Cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects on colon and breast cancer cell lines and the influence on their redox status make tested flavonoids good candidates fordeveloping new anticancer drugs.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
