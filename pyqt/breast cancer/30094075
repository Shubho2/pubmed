New technologies like the liquid biopsy are augmenting available therapeutic opportunities. This report aims to analyse theexperience of our MTB in the implementation of personalised medicine in a cancer network.Materials and methods: Patients diagnosed with solid tumours progressing tostandard treatments were referred to our Phase I unit. They underwentcomprehensive next generation sequencing (NGS) of either tumour tissue orcell-free circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) or both. The MTB expressed either apositive or negative opinion for the treatment of the patients with discovereddruggable alterations inside a clinical trial, in an expanded access programme,with a compassionate use. Afterwards, discovered alterations were matched withOncoKB levels of evidence for the choice of alteration-specific treatments inorder to compare MTB outcomes with a standardised set of recommendations.Results: NGS was performed either on ctDNA or tumour tissue or in both of them in204 patients. The MTB evaluated 173 of these cases. Overall, the MTB proposedalteration-specific targeted therapy to 72 patients (41.6%). 49 patients (28.3%of the total evaluated) were indicated to enter a clinical trial. In 29 patients with matched liquid biopsy NGS (lbNGS), tumour tissue NGS (ttNGS) and MTBevaluation, the MTB changed the treatment strategy coming from standardisedrecommendations based on lbNGS and ttNGS alone in 10 patients (34.5%), thanks to the evaluation of other clinical parameters. In our cohort, lbNGS was morelikely, compared with ttNGS, to detect point mutations (OR 11, 95% CI 2.9 to24.1, p<0.001) and all-type alterations (OR 13.6, 95% CI 5.5 to 43.2, p<0.001)from the same genes of matched patients.Conclusions: Our MTB allows patients with refractory cancer to be included inclinical trials and improves the precision of clinical decisions compared with a standardised set of mutation-driven recommendations.DOI: 10.1136/esmoopen-2018-000398 PMCID: PMC6069914PMID: 30094075
