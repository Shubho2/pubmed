Weestimated mortality rates due to breast cancer and all other causes combined todetermine their impact on overall mortality by year, age, and birth cohort.METHODS: Based on mortality rates from publicly available datasets, anage-period-cohort model was used to estimate the proportion of deaths due tobreast cancer for US women aged 0 to 119 years, with birth years 1900 to 2000.Breast cancer mortality was calculated as all-cause mortality multiplied by theproportion of deaths due to breast cancer; other-cause mortality was thedifference between all-cause and breast cancer mortality.RESULTS: Breast cancer and other-cause mortality rates were higher for older agesand birth cohorts. The percent of deaths due to breast cancer increased acrossbirth cohorts from 1900 to 1940 then decreased. Among 50-year-old women, in the1920 birth cohort, 52 (9.9%) of 100,000 deaths (95% CI, 9.8% to 10.1%) wereattributed to breast cancer whereas 476 of 100,000 were due to other causes; inthe 1960 birth cohort, 22 (8.5%) of 100,000 deaths (95% CI, 8.3% to 8.7%) wereattributed to breast cancer with 242 of 100,000 deaths due to other causes. Thepercentage of all deaths due to breast cancer was highest (4.1% to 12.9%) forwomen in their 40s and 50s for all birth cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: This study offers evidence that advances in breast cancer screening and treatment have reduced breast cancer mortality for women across the agespectrum, and provides estimates of age-, year- and birth cohort-specificcompeting mortality rates for simulation models. Other-cause mortality estimates are important in these models because most women die from causes other thanbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X17717981 PMCID: PMC5963706 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29554467
