Weexamined racial differences in clinical and tumor characteristics, treatment and survival in patients diagnosed with breast cancer between 2005 and 2014 at asingle institution, the James Cancer Hospital, and who were included in theArthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute CancerRegistry in Columbus OH. Statistical analyses included likelihood ratiochi-square tests for differences in proportions, as well as univariate andmultivariate Cox proportional hazards regressions to examine associations betweenrace and overall and progression-free survival probabilities. AA women made up10.2% (469 of 4593) the sample. Average time to onset of treatment afterdiagnosis was almost two times longer in AA women compared to white women (62.0days vs 35.5 days, p < 0.0001). AA women were more likely to report past orcurrent tobacco use, experience delays in treatment, have triple negative andlate stage breast cancer, and were less likely to receive surgery, especiallymastectomy and reconstruction following mastectomy. After adjustment forconfounding factors (age, grade, and surgery), overall survival probability wassignificantly associated with race (HR = 1.33; 95% CI 1.03-1.72). These findings highlight the need for efforts focused on screening and receipt of prompttreatment among AA women diagnosed with breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0059-5 PMCID: PMC5861087PMID: 29582015
