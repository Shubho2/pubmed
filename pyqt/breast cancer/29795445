Epub 2018 May24.MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 mutations are associated with sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in multiple cancer models.Xue Z(1), Vis DJ(1), Bruna A(2), Sustic T(1), van Wageningen S(1), Batra AS(2),Rueda OM(2), Bosdriesz E(1), Caldas C(2)(3), Wessels LFA(1), Bernards R(4).Author information: (1)Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Oncode Institute, The Netherlands CancerInstitute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam, 1066 CX, The Netherlands.(2)Department of Oncology and Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, Li Ka ShingCentre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0RE, UK.(3)Cambridge Breast Unit, NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and CambridgeExperimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Cambridge University Hospitals NHSFoundation Trust, Cambridge, CB2 2QQ, UK.(4)Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Oncode Institute, The Netherlands CancerInstitute, Plesmanlaan 121, Amsterdam, 1066 CX, The Netherlands.r.bernards@nki.nl.Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is frequent in cancer. Drug development efforts have been focused on kinases in this pathway,most notably on RAF and MEK. We show here that MEK inhibition activates JNK-JUNsignaling through suppression of DUSP4, leading to activation of HER ReceptorTyrosine Kinases. This stimulates the MAPK pathway in the presence of drug,thereby blunting the effect of MEK inhibition. Cancers that have lost MAP3K1 orMAP2K4 fail to activate JNK-JUN. Consequently, loss-of-function mutations ineither MAP3K1 or MAP2K4 confer sensitivity to MEK inhibition by disablingJNK-JUN-mediated feedback loop upon MEK inhibition. In a panel of 168 PatientDerived Xenograft (PDX) tumors, MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 mutation status is a strongpredictor of response to MEK inhibition. Our findings suggest that cancers havingmutations in MAP3K1 or MAP2K4, which are frequent in tumors of breast, prostateand colon, may respond to MEK inhibitors. Our findings also suggest that MAP3K1and MAP2K4 are potential drug targets in combination with MEK inhibitors, inspite of the fact that they are encoded by tumor suppressor genes.DOI: 10.1038/s41422-018-0044-4 PMCID: PMC6028652PMID: 29795445
