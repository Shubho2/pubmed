The role of 14, 15-EET inbreast cancer cell adhesion, invasion was explored by adhesion and Transwellassays. The role of 14, 15-EET in breast cancer cell cisplatin resistance invitro was determined by MTT assay. Western blot was conducted to detect theprotein expressions of EMT-related markers and FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling. Xenograft models in nude mice were established to explore the roles of 14, 15-EET in breastcancer cells EMT and cisplatin resistance in vivo.RESULTS: In the present study, we show that serum level of 14, 15-EET increasesin breast cancer patients and 14, 15-EET level of tumor tissue is higher thanthat of non-cancerous tissue. Moreover, 14, 15-EET increases integrin αvβ3expression, leading to FAK activation. 14, 15-EET induces breast cancer cell EMT via integrin αvβ3 and FAK/PI3K/AKT cascade activation in vitro. Furthermore, wefind that 14, 15-EET induces breast cancer cells EMT and cisplatin resistance in vivo, αvβ3 integrin and the resulting FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway areresponsible for 14, 15-EET induced-breast cancer cells cisplatin resistance.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that inhibition of 14, 15-EET or inactivationof integrin αvβ3/FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway could serve as a novel approach to reverse EMT and cisplatin resistance in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0694-6 PMCID: PMC5807756PMID: 29426357
