The identification of specific pathway of apoptosis/survival regulation is the aim of this study. We generated knocked-downPRODH/POX MCF-7 breast cancer cells (MCF-7shPRODH/POX). PRODH/POX silencing didnot affect cell viability. However, it contributed to decrease in DNA andcollagen biosynthesis, increase in prolidase activity and intracellular prolineconcentration as well as increase in the expression of iNOS, NF-κB, mTOR, HIF-1α,COX-2, AMPK, Atg7 and Beclin-1 in MCF-7shPRODH/POX cells. In these cells,glycyl-proline (GlyPro, substrate for prolidase) further inhibited DNA andcollagen biosynthesis, maintained high prolidase activity, intracellularconcentration of proline and up-regulated HIF-1α, AMPK, Atg7 and Beclin-1,compared to GlyPro-treated MCF-7 cells. In MCF-7 cells, GlyPro increased collagenbiosynthesis, concentration of proline and expression of caspase-3, cleavedcaspases -3 and -9, iNOS, NF-κB, COX-2 and AMPKβ. PRODH/POX knock-downcontributed to pro-survival autophagy pathways in MCF-7 cells and GlyPro-derived proline augmented this process. However, GlyPro induced apoptosis inPRODH/POX-expressing MCF-7 cells as detected by up-regulation of active caspases -3 and -9. The data suggest that PRODH/POX silencing induces autophagy in MCF-7cells and GlyPro-derived proline supports this process.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24466 PMCID: PMC5862612PMID: 29568391
