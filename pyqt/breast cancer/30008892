Promoter methylationdownregulates Per1, Per2 or Per3 expression in myeloid leukemia, breast, lung,and other cancer cells; whereas histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) upregulatePer1 or Per3 expression in certain cancer cell lines. However, thetranscriptional regulation of Per1 and Per2 in cancer cells by chromatinmodifications is not fully understood. The present study aimed to determinewhether HDACi regulate Per1 and Per2 expression in gastric cancer cell lines, andto investigate changes in chromatin modifications in response to HDACi. Treatmentof KATO III and NCI-N87 human gastric cancer cells with sodium butyrate (NaB) or Trichostatin A (TSA) induced Per1 and Per2 mRNA expression in a dose-dependentmanner. Chromatin immunoprecipitaion assays revealed that NaB and TSA decreasedlysine 9 trimethylation on histone H3 (H3K9me3) at the Per1 promoter. TSA, butnot NaB increased H3K9 acetylation at the Per2 promoter. It was also observedthat binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the Per1 promoter decreased following NaBtreatment, whereas Sp1 binding increased at the Per2 promoter of NaB- andTSA-treated cells. In addition, Per1 promoter is not methylated in KATO IIIcells, while Per2 promoter was methylated, although NaB, TSA, and 5-Azacytidinedo not change the methylated CpGs analyzed. In conclusion, HDACi induce Per1 and Per2 expression, in part, through mechanisms involving chromatin remodeling atthe proximal promoter of these genes; however, other indirect mechanismstriggered by these HDACi cannot be ruled out. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated regulatory pathway between silencing of Per1 gene by H3K9me3 andupregulation of Per2 by HDACi in cancer cells.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8851 PMCID: PMC6036517PMID: 30008892
