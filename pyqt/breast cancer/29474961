Electronic address: pierpaolo.ceci@cnr.it.A genetically engineered human ferritin heavy chain (HFt)-based construct hasbeen recently shown by our group to efficiently entrap and deliver doxorubicin tocancer cells. This construct, named HFt-MP-PAS, contained a tumor-selectivesequence (MP) responsive to proteolytic cleavage by tumor proteases (MMPs),located between each HFt subunit and an outer shielding polypeptide sequence richin proline (P), serine (S) and alanine (A) residues (PAS). HFt-MP-PAS displayedexcellent therapeutic efficacy in xenogenic pancreatic and head and neck cancermodels in vivo, leading to a significant increase in overall animal survivals.Here we report a new construct obtained by the genetic insertion of two glutamateresidues in the PAS sequence of HFt-MP-PAS. Such new construct, namedHFt-MP-PASE, is characterized by improved performances as drug biodistribution ina xenogenic pancreatic cancer model in vivo. Moreover, HFt-MP-PASE efficientlyencapsulates the anti-cancer drug mitoxantrone (MIT), and the resultingMIT-loaded nanoparticles proved to be more soluble and monodispersed than theHFt-MP-PAS counterparts. Importantly, in vitro MIT-loaded HFt-MP-PASE killsseveral cancer cell lines of different origin (colon, breast, sarcoma andpancreas) at least as efficiently as the free drug. Finally, our MIT loadedprotein nanocages allowed in vivo an impressive incrementing of the drugaccumulation in the tumor with respect to the free drug.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
