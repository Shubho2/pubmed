English-, Arabic- andItalian-speaking women (n = 317) between the ages of 50 to 74 in North WestMelbourne, Australia were recruited to complete a survey exploring healthliteracy, barriers to breast cancer screening, and self-reported screeningparticipation. A total of 219 women (69%) reported having a breast screen within the past two years. Results revealed that health literacy was not associated withscreening participation. Instead, emotional barriers were a significant factor inthe self-reported uptake of screening. Three health literacy domains were relatedto lower emotional breast screening barriers, feeling understood and supported byhealthcare providers, social support for health and understanding healthinformation well enough to know what to do. Compared with English- andItalian-speaking women, Arabic-speaking women reported more emotional barriers toscreening and greater challenges in understanding health information well enough to know what to do. Interventions that can improve breast screening participationrates should aim to reduce emotional barriers to breast screening, particularlyfor Arabic-speaking women.DOI: 10.3390/ijerph15081677 PMID: 30087259
