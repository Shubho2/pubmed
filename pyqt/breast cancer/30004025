The aim was to determine whether recent epidemiologic studies oflow-LET radiation, particularly those at low doses and/or low dose rates(LD/LDR), broadly support the LNT model of carcinogenic risk or, on the contrary,demonstrate sufficient evidence that the LNT model is inappropriate for thepurposes of radiation protection. An updated review was needed because aconsiderable number of reports of radiation epidemiologic studies based on new orupdated data have been published since other major reviews were conducted bynational and international scientific committees. The Commentary provides acritical review of the LD/LDR studies that are most directly applicable tocurrent occupational, environmental and medical radiation exposure circumstances.This Memorandum summarizes several of the more important LD/LDR studies thatincorporate radiation dose responses for solid cancer and leukaemia that werereviewed in Commentary No. 27. In addition, an overview is provided of radiation studies of breast and thyroid cancers, and cancer after childhood exposures.Non-cancers are briefly touched upon such as ischemic heart disease, cataracts,and heritable genetic effects. To assess the applicability and utility of the LNTmodel for radiation protection, the Commentary evaluated 29 epidemiologic studiesor groups of studies, primarily of total solid cancer, in terms of strengths and weaknesses in their epidemiologic methods, dosimetry approaches, and statistical modeling, and the degree to which they supported a LNT model for continued use inradiation protection. Recommendations for how to make epidemiologic radiationstudies more informative are outlined. The NCRP Committee recognizes that therisks from LD/LDR are small and uncertain. The Committee judged that theavailable epidemiologic data were broadly supportive of the LNT model and that atthis time no alternative dose-response relationship appears more pragmatic orprudent for radiation protection purposes.Â© 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.DOI: 10.1088/1361-6498/aad348 PMID: 30004025
