Are there any clinical or histologic features that predictupgrade in papillomas, incidental or non-incidental?Zaleski M(1), Chen YA(2), Chetlen AL(3), Mack J(3), Xu L(4), Dodge DG(5),Karamchandani DM(6).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Division of Anatomic Pathology, Penn State HealthMilton S.

Electronic address:dkaramchandani@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.The clinical decision to excise intraductal papilloma (IDP) without atypiadiagnosed on biopsy remains controversial. We sought to establish clinical andhistologic predictors (if any) which may predict upgrade in IDP. 296 biopsies (in278 women) with histologic diagnosis of IDP without atypia were retrospectivelyidentified and placed into Incidental (no corresponding imaging correlate), orNon-incidental (positive imaging correlate) groups. 253/296 (85.5%) cases werenon-incidental, and 43/296 (14.5%) were incidental. 73.1% (185/253)non-incidental and 48.8% (21/43) incidental cases underwent excision. 12.4%(23/185) non-incidental cases underwent an upgrade to cancer or high-risk lesion;namely 8-Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 8-atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH),6-lobular neoplasia, and 1-flat epithelial atypia. There was no histopathologicfeature on the biopsy in the non-incidental group which predicted upgrade;however a past history of atypia was significantly associated with upgrade. 2 of the 21 incidental cases upgraded (1 to ADH and 1 to lobular neoplasia); theformer had a past history of ADH. Both incidental upgrades were >1 mm in size,and were not completely excised on the biopsy. None of the incidental cases whichappeared completely excised on biopsy upgraded, irrespective of the size onbiopsy. These findings suggest that all non-incidental IDPs should be considered candidates for surgical excision, given the 12.4% upgrade rate and no definitive histologic predictors of upgrade. Patients with incidental IDPs (if <1 mm,completely excised on biopsy and with no history of high risk breast lesion) can be spared excision.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
