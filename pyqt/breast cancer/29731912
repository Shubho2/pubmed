However, Mfn2 is considered as an anti-tumor gene,and is silenced in human malignant tumors, including those of breast cancer.However, the mechanisms contributing to Mfn2 silencing and the mechanism of itsanti-tumor function in breast cancer remain unclear. In the present study,hypoexpression of Mfn2, and hypermethylation of its promoter, was confirmed inhuman breast cancer cells and in breast cancer tissues by reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and methylationspecific PCR, respectively. Chemical demethylation treatment with5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine upregulated the mRNA expression level of Mfn2 in MCF-7cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, overexpression of Mfn2 repressedthe proliferation, migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells, mediated by inhibition of the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling pathway.However, overexpression of Mfn2 with deletion of the p21Ras motif (Mfn2ΔRas) and protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site (Mfn2ΔPKA) partially reduced theanti-tumor function of Mfn2, and inhibited the Ras-ERK1/2 signaling pathway.Taken together, the present study confirmed the anti-tumor effects of Mfn2 inhuman breast cancer and clarified that the mechanism of its anti-tumor functions includes promoter DNA methylation, the P21Ras binding site and PKAphosphorylation.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8314 PMCID: PMC5921267PMID: 29731912
