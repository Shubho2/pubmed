Electronic address: bt2160@cumc.columbia.edu.(2)Department of Breast Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York,NY.(3)Department of Breast Imaging, Columbia University Medical Center, New York,NY.BACKGROUND: Recently there are efforts to use sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)techniques after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to minimize axillary surgery.However, studies have shown higher false negative rates in this scenario, whichmight result in inaccurate assessment of treatment response and patient prognosisas well as leaving residual disease behind. In this study, we describe the use ofreflector-guided excision of the percutaneously biopsied node (PBN) as an aid to conventional SLNB and its predictor of the axillary status after NAC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-institution analysis of patients whounderwent axillary fiducial-reflector placement and subsequent SLNB compared withconventional SLNB.RESULTS: Nineteen patients in the reflector group were matched with 19 patientswho underwent conventional SLNB (conventional group). The PBN was identified inthe SLNB in 19 patients (100%) in the reflector group and in 9 patients (47.3%)in the conventional group (P = .002). In the remaining 10 patients in theconventional group, the PBN was identified in the axillary lymph node dissection specimen in 4 patients (21%) and not identified in 6 patients (31.7%). Among the 38 patients, traditional mapping failed to identify the PBN in 13 patients(34.2%). The PBN was negative in 10 patients (36%) and positive in 18 patients(64%); no additional positive nodes were identified among patients with anegative PBN, correctly reflecting the status of the axilla in 100% of cases.CONCLUSION: Mapping failure after NAC might compromise SLNB. Reflector-guidedexcision of the PBN is not only facile and feasible, but more accurately reflectsthe status of the axilla after NAC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
