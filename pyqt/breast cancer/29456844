Early detection of BC is important to improve survival rates anddecrease mortality. The aim of the present study was to investigate serumbiomarkers using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight massspectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) to distinguish patients with BC from the healthypopulation and patients with benign breast diseases (BBDs). A total of 62patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, as confirmed by histopathology, and 47non-cancerous individuals (NCIs) [16 healthy controls (HCs) and 31 patients with BBD] were enrolled in the present study. Serum protein profiles were determinedby SELDI-TOF-MS using an immobilized metal affinity capture array. Serum frompatients with BC were compared with that from the HC group using univariate andmultivariate statistical analyses. A total of 118 clusters were generated fromthe individual serum. Univariate analysis revealed that 5 peaks weresignificantly downregulated (m/z 1,452, 2,670, 3,972, 5,354 and 5,523; P<0.001)and 4 were upregulated (m/z 6,850, 7,926, 8,115 and 8,143; P<0.001) in patientswith BC compared with the HC group. A comparison of patients with BC and patientswith BBD revealed an additional 9 protein peaks. Among these, 3 peaks (m/z 3,972,5,336 and 11,185) were significantly downregulated and 6 peaks (m/z 4,062, 4,071,4,609, 6,850, 8,115 and 8,133) were significantly upregulated. A total of 3 peaks[mass-to-change ratio (m/z) 3,972, 6,850 and 8,115 (BC2)] were common in bothsets. The results of the present study suggest that a 4 protein peak set [m/z3,972, 6,850 and 8,115 (BC2) and 8,949 (BC3)] could be used to distinguishpatients with BC from NCI.DOI: 10.3892/br.2018.1042 PMCID: PMC5795628PMID: 29456844
