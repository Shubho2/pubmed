[Epub ahead of print]3-D Single Breath-hold Shear Strain Estimation for Improved Breast LesionDetection and Classification in Automated Volumetric Ultrasound Scanners.Hendriks GAGM, Chen C, Hansen HHG, de Korte CL.Automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) is an ultrasound imaging modality used in breast cancer screening. It has high sensitivity but limited specificity as it ishard to discriminate between benign and malignant lesions by echogenicproperties. Specificity might be improved by shear strain imaging as malignantlesions, firmly-bonded to its host tissue, show different shear patterns comparedto benign lesions, often loosely-bonded. Therefore, 3-D quasi-static elastographywas implemented in an ABVS-like system. Plane-wave instead of conventionalfocussed transmissions were used to reduce scantimes within a single breath-hold.3-D strain tensor was obtained and shear strains were reconstructed in phantomscontaining firmly- and loosely-bonded lesions. Experiments were also simulated infinite-element-models (FEM). Experimental results, confirmed by FEM-results,indicated that loosely-bonded lesions showed increased maximal shear strains (~2.5%) and different shear patterns compared to firmly-bonded lesions (~ 0.9%). Toconclude, we successfully implemented 3-D elastography in an ABVS-like system to assess lesion bonding by shear strain imaging.DOI: 10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2849687 PMID: 29994473
