Multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are a popular methodfor three-dimensional (3D) cell culture, because they capture some aspects of thedimensionality, cell-cell contact, and cell-matrix interactions seen in vivo.Many approaches exist to create MCTS from cell lines, and they have been used to study tumor cell invasion, growth, and how cells respond to drugs inphysiologically relevant 3D microenvironments. However, there are severaldiscrepancies in the observations made of cell behaviors when comparing betweenMCTS formation methods. To resolve these inconsistencies, we created and comparedthe behavior of breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer cells across three MCTSformation methods: in polyNIPAAM gels, in microwells, or in suspension culture.These methods formed MCTS via proliferation from single cells or passiveaggregation, and therefore showed differential reliance on genes important forcell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. We also found that the MCTS formationmethod dictated drug sensitivity, where MCTS formed over longer periods of timevia clonal growth were more resistant to treatment. Toward clinical application, we compared an ovarian cancer cell line MCTS formed in polyNIPAAM with cells frompatient-derived malignant ascites. The method that relied on clonal growth(PolyNIPAAM gel) was more time and cost intensive, but yielded MCTS that wereuniformly spherical, and exhibited the most reproducible drug responses.Conversely, MCTS methods that relied on aggregation were faster, but yielded MCTSwith grapelike, lobular structures. These three MCTS formation methods differedin culture time requirements and complexity, and had distinct drug responseprofiles, suggesting the choice of MCTS formation method should be carefullychosen based on the application required.DOI: 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00069 PMCID: PMC5843470PMID: 29527571
