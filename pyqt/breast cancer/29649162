Several natural andsynthetic molecules show activity by interacting with these proteins. Inparticular, a number of vegetal compounds known as phytoestrogens showsestrogenic or anti-estrogenic activity. The majority of these compounds belongsto the isoflavones family and the most representative one, genistein, showsanti-proliferative effects on various hormone-sensitive cancer cells, includingbreast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In this work we describe the identification of structurally related homoisoflavones isolated from Leopoldia comosa (L.) Parl.(L. comosa), a perennial bulbous plant, potentially useful as hormonalsubstitutes or complements in cancer treatments. Two of these compounds have beenselected as potential ligands of estrogen receptors (ERs) and the interactionwith both isoforms of estrogen receptors have been investigated through moleculardocking on their crystallographic structures. The results provide evidence of thebinding of these compounds to the target receptors and their interactions withkey residues of the active sites of the two proteins, and thus they couldrepresent suitable leads for the development of novel tools for the dissection ofER signaling and the development of new pharmacological treatments inhormone-sensitive cancers.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23040894 PMID: 29649162
