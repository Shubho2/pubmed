Accordingly, thismeta-analysis was conducted.METHODS: Relevant studies published until April 2018 were retrieved and werescreened according to established inclusion criteria. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the association betweenperiodontal disease and the risk of breast cancer and fixed effect models wereused according to the results of the heterogeneity test.RESULTS: Eight studies, involving 168,111 individuals, were identified as having explored the association between periodontal disease and breast cancer. Summaryestimates in view of adjusted data showed that periodontal disease did increasesusceptibility to breast cancer (RR = 1.18, 95%CI: 1.11-1.26, I2  = 17.6%), with robust results confirmed by sensitivity analysis.CONCLUSION: Our results provided evidence of a modest positive associationbetween periodontal disease and breast cancer. Implementation of practicalmeasures to prevent and treat periodontal disease is of great public healthsignificance. Moreover, additional studies are recommended to explore this topic in more detail.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/jcpe.12982 PMID: 29974484
