It is commonly assumed thatE-cadherin is uniformly lost during the process of epithelial-mesenchymaltransition. Breast tumor cells typically invade as a cohesive multicellular unit in a process called collective invasion. The aim of this study was to reveal the clinical importance of the expression pattern of E-cadherin and vimentin inbreast cancer.METHODS: E-cadherin and vimentin protein expression was evaluated byimmunohistochemistry in 176 invasive breast cancer samples. Among these,E-cadherin and vimentin expression were evaluated in the set of primary site and metastatic lymph nodes in 65 cases. In addition, E-cadherin and vimentinexpression were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy to see E-cadherin and vimentin localization in the breast cancer cells.RESULTS: Both at the primary site and metastatic lymph nodes, both E-cadherin-and vimentin-positive tumors had the worst disease-free and overall survivalamong all cases. In addition, E-cadherin and vimentin protein is colocalizedwithin the same tumor cells in a human breast cancer specimen.CONCLUSION: Our present data suggest the existence of an aggressive subpopulationin the primary tumor nest of breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
