However, owing to lackof a feasible and safe biopsy method, management of IMNs is still controversialin breast surgery.METHODS: From 2005 to 2009, a total of 337 consecutive breast cancer womenpatients were recruited. All patients underwent IMNs biopsy through intercostalspace or endoscopic lymphatic chain resection. The ER, PR and HER-2 status wereretested according to the current ASCO/CAP guidelines. We analyzed therelationship between clinical pathological parameters and IMNs metastasis andinvestigated the high risk factors and prognostic values of IMNs metastasis inbreast cancer.RESULTS: Among 337 patients, 314 patients underwent intercostal space IMNs biopsyand 23 patients underwent endoscopic lymphatic chain resection. A total of 63(18.69%) patients were pathologically diagnosed with IMNs metastasis. Among them,28 (44.44%) patients changed the pathological lymph node staging, and 15 cases(23.81%) changed the postoperative comprehensive treatment program and acceptedextended postoperative radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis showed that comparedwith no ALN involvement, the risk of IMNs metastasis was significantly increased in patients with 1-3 ALN involvement (OR = 42.097, 95% CI = 5.225-339.178;P = 0.0004) and ≥4 ALN involvement (OR = 82.429, 95%CI = 10.134-670.496;P < 0.0001). The risk of IMNs metastasis in HER-2 positive patients wassignificantly higher than that in negative patients (OR = 5.452, 95%CI = 2.353-12.634; P < 0.0001). However, we did not find IMNs involvement was an independent indicator for both overall survival and disease-free survival.CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical practice and data indicated that IMNs biopsy throughintercostal space and endoscopic lymphatic chain resection are effective andminimally invasive methods to detect the IMNs status, which may be helpful foraccurate tumor staging, risk assessment and option of chemotherapy orradiotherapy to improve the patients' survival.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
