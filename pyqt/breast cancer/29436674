Epub 2018 Feb 7.The targeted inhibition of Hsp90 by a synthetic small molecule, DPide offers aneffective treatment strategy against TNBCs.Oh YJ(1), Park SY(1), Seo YH(1).Author information: (1)College of Pharmacy, Keimyung University, Daegu 704‑701, Republic of Korea.Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are the most aggressive and metastaticsubtype of breast cancers and exhibit poor clinical outcome due to the lack ofdrug target receptors such as estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors(PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2). The limitedeffectiveness of therapeutic options and the poor prognosis of TNBC patientsemphasize the urgent need for identifying new therapeutic agents. In this regard,heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target forthe treatment of TNBCs. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that regulates thefolding, stability, and function of many oncogenic proteins. Hence, theinhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function leads to a simultaneous blockage ofmultiple signaling pathways in the proliferation and survival of cancers. In the present study, we performed the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation ofHsp90 inhibitors and found that a synthetic small molecule, DPide exerted apotent anticancer activity against TNBC cell line, MDA‑MB‑231 and non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, H1975 with GI50 values of 0.478 and 1.67 µM,respectively. Soft‑agar colony formation assay also revealed that DPidesuppressed the anchorage‑independent growth of MDA‑MB‑231 cells. Western blotanalysis indicated that the treatment of MDA‑MB‑231 cells with DPide induced the proteasomal degradation of EGFR, Her2, Met, Akt, c‑Raf, and Cdk4 and theconsequent cleavage of PARP, leading to apoptotic cell death. DPide alsoinhibited the migration and MMP9 activity of MDA‑MB‑231 cells, suggesting thatthe metastatic potential of TNBCs could be suppressed by DPide. Collectively,DPide offers an effective therapeutic option for the treatment TNBCs.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6250 PMID: 29436674
