Secondary outcomes were pCR rate and association to BCT. Meta-analyses wereperformed using random effects models that use inverse-variance weighting foreach treatment arm based on evaluable patients. Point estimates are reported with95% confidence interval (CI), and p < 0.05 was considered statisticallysignificant.RESULTS: Thirty-six studies were identified (N = 12,311 patients). We selectedfor the analysis 16 of 36 studies reporting both pCR and BCT for at least onetreatment arm. Arms per study ranged from one to six; 42 independent units wereavailable to evaluate the association between pCR and BCT. BCT rate ranged 5-76% across arms with an average BCT of 57% (95% CI 52-62%). Significant heterogeneitywas observed among the trials (Cochrane Q = 787, p < 0.001, I2 = 97%). In themeta-regression model, BCT rates were not significantly associated with year offirst patient-in (p = 0.89), grade (p = 0.93) and hormone-receptor status(p = 0.39). Clinical N-stage (p = 0.01) and human epidermal growth factorreceptor (HER2) status (p = 0.03) were significantly associated with BCT. pCRrate ranged 3-60% across studies. The average pCR across all study arms was 24%(95% CI 19-29%). No association was observed between pCR rate in a study arm and the resulting BCT rate in a univariate model (p = 0.34) nor after adjusting forHER2 and clinical nodal status (p = 0.82). In the subset of 14 multi-arm studies,no significant association was seen between the differences in pCR and BCTbetween treatment arms (p = 0.27).CONCLUSIONS: pCR does not increase BCT in patients receiving NST for EBC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
