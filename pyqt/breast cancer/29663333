Instead, gross ETE invading only strap muscles hasbeen designated as a new T3b category. The long-term prognosis of patients withDTC and gross ETE invading only strap muscles was investigated.METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwentthyroidectomy between 1996 and 2005. Differences in cancer-specific andrecurrence-free survival according to extent of ETE were assessed.RESULTS: A total of 3174 patients with DTC were included. No significantdifferences were observed in 10-year cancer-specific survival among patients withno ETE (98·6 per cent), microscopic ETE (98·3 per cent) and gross ETE invadingonly strap muscles (98·9 per cent) (P = 0·375). The 10-year recurrence-freesurvival rate for patients with gross ETE invading only strap muscles (89·2 percent) was shorter than that for patients with no ETE (93·7 per cent; P = 0·016), but similar to that of patients with microscopic ETE (90·3 per cent). Inunivariable analysis, patients with gross ETE invading only strap muscles had asignificantly higher risk of recurrence than those with no ETE (hazard ratio (HR)1·67, 95 per cent c.i. 1·10 to 2·55; P = 0·017). In multivariable analysis, grossETE invading only strap muscles was not an independent predictor of recurrence(HR 1·09, 0·71 to 1·69; P = 0·685).CONCLUSION: Although gross ETE invading only strap muscles may provide prognosticinformation about long-term recurrence, it does not affect mortality. The actual impact of gross ETE invading only strap muscles will be important in revising thestaging system in the future.© 2018 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/bjs.10830 PMID: 29663333
