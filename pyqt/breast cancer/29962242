However, the correlation between IMPDH2 and breast cancerhas never been reported. In this study, IMPDH2 expression was measured in 40cases of breast cancer tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues byquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blottingassays. Then, IMPDH2 expression was further detected in 153 cases of breastcancer tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlation between IMPDH2expression and clinicopathological characteristics and patients' prognosis wasinvestigated in breast cancer. Results shown that IMPDH2 mRNA level in breastcancer tissues was significantly elevated compared with those in matched adjacentnormal tissues (P<0.001). The high-expression rate of IMPDH2 in breast cancertissues was 62.7%, which was significantly higher than those in adjacent normaltissues (17.6%, P<0.001). IMPDH2 high expression correlated with lymph nodemetastasis and TNM stage in breast cancer (P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysisrevealed that IMPDH2 as well as lymph node metastasis and TNM stage weresignificantly associated with patients' prognosis (P<0.05). Multivariate Coxregression analysis showed MPDH2, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage could beserved as independent factors to predict prognosis. Thus, these data indicateIMPDH2 is highly expressed in breast cancer and predicts unfavourable prognosis, which may be served as a potential biomarker.DOI: 10.1080/1354750X.2018.1496360 PMID: 29962242
