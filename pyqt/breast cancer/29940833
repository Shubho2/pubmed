The idea thatdifferences in gene expression ranking are associated with presence or absence ofdisease is compelling and has strong biological plausibility. Nevertheless, theTSP formulation ignores significant available information which can improveclassification accuracy and is vulnerable to selecting genes which do not havedifferential expression in the two conditions ("pivot" genes).RESULTS: We introduce the AUCTSP classifier as an alternative rank-basedestimator of the magnitude of the ranking reversals involved in the original TSP.The proposed estimator is based on the Area Under the Receiver OperatingCharacteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) and as such, takes into account the separationof the entire distribution of gene expression levels in gene pairs under theconditions considered, as opposed to comparing gene rankings within individualsubjects as in the original TSP formulation. Through extensive simulations andcase studies involving classification in ovarian, leukemia, colon, breast andprostate cancers and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, we show the superiority ofthe proposed approach in terms of improving classification accuracy, avoidingoverfitting and being less prone to selecting non-informative (pivot) genes.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed AUCTSP is a simple yet reliable and robust rank-basedclassifier for gene expression classification. While the AUCTSP works by the sameprinciple as TSP, its ability to determine the top scoring gene pair based on therelative rankings of two marker genes across all subjects as opposed to eachindividual subject results in significant performance gains in classificationaccuracy. In addition, the proposed method tends to avoid selection ofnon-informative (pivot) genes as members of the top-scoring pair.DOI: 10.1186/s12859-018-2231-1 PMCID: PMC6020231PMID: 29940833
