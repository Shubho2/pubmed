[Epub ahead of print]Platelet deficiency in Tpo-/- mice can both promote and suppress the metastasisof experimental breast tumors in an organ-specific manner.Thiele W(1)(2), Rothley M(3)(4), Dimmler A(5), Bugert P(6), Salomó Coll C(4),Sleeman JP(3)(4).Author information: (1)Medizinische Fakultät Mannheim, Universität Heidelberg, 68167, Mannheim,Germany. wilko.thiele@medma.uni-heidelberg.de.(2)Institut für Toxikologie und Genetik, KIT Campus Nord, 76021, Karlsruhe,Germany. wilko.thiele@medma.uni-heidelberg.de.(3)Medizinische Fakultät Mannheim, Universität Heidelberg, 68167, Mannheim,Germany.(4)Institut für Toxikologie und Genetik, KIT Campus Nord, 76021, Karlsruhe,Germany.(5)Institut für Pathologie, Vincentius Kliniken Karlsruhe, 76137, Karlsruhe,Germany.(6)Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Immunology, Heidelberg University,Medical Faculty Mannheim, German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Württemberg -Hessen gGmbH, Mannheim, Germany.Platelets are thought to play an important role in metastasis formation, althoughthe mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Here we studied theinfluence of platelet numbers on organ-specific metastasis to the lungs and lymphnodes using Tpo deficient mice that have low platelet counts. After tail veininjection of 4T1 breast cancer cells, the number of lung metastases wassignificantly lower in Tpo-/- mice compared to Tpo+/+ mice. The same was true forthe bone-tropic 4T1.2 derivative. In spontaneous orthotopic metastasis assays,4T1 and 4T1.2 primary tumor growth was not affected by the genotype of the mice. However, the number of 4T1.2 lung metastases was significantly lower in Tpo-/-mice compared to Tpo+/+ mice, whereas the number of 4T1 lung metastases wasunaffected. Moreover, in mice bearing 4T1 tumors, lymph node metastases werelarger in the Tpo-/- background, and lymph node metastasis frequency was higherin Tpo-/- mice bearing 4T1.2 tumors compared to that in wild-type mice. Enhanced lymph node metastasis in Tpo-/- mice was not associated with changes inperitumoral lymphatic vessel density in the primary tumors. Together, our dataindicate that platelets do not affect primary tumor growth in this breast cancer model, but can differentially influence site-specific metastasis to lymph nodesand lungs.DOI: 10.1007/s10585-018-9924-8 PMID: 30043083
