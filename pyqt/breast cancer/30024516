However, these results were inconsistent.METHOD: A systematic search in PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, and ChineseNational Knowledge Infrastructure databases were conducted up to October 1, 2017.The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval was appliedto pool the effect size.RESULTS: Finally, 31 eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. Theoverall results indicated that serum adiponectin levels in BC cases weresignificantly lower than the controls (SMD = -0.33, P < 0.0001). As for thesubgroup analysis of menstrual status, serum adiponectin levels weresignificantly lower in pre- and postmenopausal BC cases. Moreover, the subgroupanalysis by ethnicity in pre- and postmenopausal group indicated an inverseassociation between adiponectin levels and BC risk in Asian population, but notin Caucasian population.CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis suggests that low serum adiponectinconcentration may be associated with an increased BC risk in premenopausal andpostmenopausal women, especially among Asians. Adiponectin may serve as abiomarker of BC risk and help to identify subjects at high risk for BCdevelopment.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011433 PMID: 30024516  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
