Thisstudy investigates the incremental value of optoacoustic imaging in improvingBI-RADS categorization of breast masses at ultrasound.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study device is an optoacoustic breast imaging devicewith a handheld duplex laser and internal gray-scale ultrasound probe, fusingfunctional and morphologic information (optoacoustic ultrasound). In thisprospective multisite study, breast masses assessed as BI-RADS category 3, 4A,4B, 4C, or 5 by site radiologists underwent both gray-scale ultrasound andoptoacoustic imaging with the study device. Independent reader radiologistsassessed internal gray-scale ultrasound and optoacoustic ultrasound features for each mass and assigned a BI-RADS category. The percentage of mass reads for whichoptoacoustic ultrasound resulted in a downgrade or upgrade of BI-RADS categoryrelative to internal gray-scale ultrasound was determined.RESULTS: Of 94 total masses, 39 were biopsy-proven malignant, 44 werebiopsy-proven benign, and 11 BI-RADS category 3 masses were stable at 12-monthfollow-up. The sensitivity of both optoacoustic ultrasound and internalgray-scale ultrasound was 97.1%. The specificity was 44.3% for optoacousticultrasound and 36.4% for internal gray-scale ultrasound. Using optoacousticultrasound, 41.7% of benign masses or BI-RADS category 3 masses that were stable at 12-month follow-up were downgraded to BI-RADS category 2 by independentreaders; 36.6% of masses assigned BI-RADS category 4A were downgraded to BI-RADS category 3 or 2, and 10.1% assigned BI-RADS category 4B were downgraded toBI-RADS category 3 or 2. Using optoacoustic ultrasound, independent readersupgraded 75.0% of the malignant masses classified as category 4A, 4B, 4C, or 5,and 49.4% of the malignant masses were classified as category 4B, 4C, or 5.CONCLUSION: Optoacoustic ultrasound resulted in BI-RADS category downgrading ofbenign masses and upgrading of malignant masses compared with gray-scaleultrasound.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.18436 PMID: 29975115
