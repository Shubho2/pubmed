Tumor size was adjusted for residual cellularity of invasive carcinomaand used to calculate modified RDBN (mRDBN) and compared with unmodified grosstumor size (gRDBN).Results: RDBN could be calculated in 428 cases. Relative risks of recurrence and death were significantly higher for RDBN-3 and RDBN-4 compared with RDBN-1.Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant differences in disease-free survival andoverall survival for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative/human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative and ER-positive/HER2-negative subgroups (P <.0001).Conclusions: Both mRDBN and gRDBN provide prognostic information, particularly inHER2-negative carcinoma; however, mRDBN showed better stratification of RDBN-3and RDBN-4 patients.DOI: 10.1093/ajcp/aqx168 PMID: 29481634
