Increased levels of extracellular AGR2 (eAGR2) have been correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients, making it apotential biomarker. Additionally, neutralizing AGR2 antibodies showedpreclinical effectiveness in murine cancer models suggesting eAGR2 may be atherapeutic target. We set out to identify a peptide by mRNA display that wouldserve as a theranostic tool targeting AGR2. This method enables the selection of peptides from a complex (>1011) library and incorporates a protease incubationstep that filters the selection for serum stable peptides. We performed sixsuccessive rounds of enrichment using a 10-amino acid mRNA display library andidentified several AGR2 binding peptides. One of these peptides (H10),demonstrated high affinity binding to AGR2 with a binding constant (KD) of 6.4nM. We developed an AGR2 ELISA with the H10 peptide as the capture reagent. OurH10-based ELISA detected eAGR2 from cancer cell spent media with a detectionlimit of (20-50 ng/ml). Furthermore, we investigated the therapeutic utility ofH10 and discovered that it inhibited cell viability at IC50 (9-12 μmoles/L) incancer cell lines. We also determined that 10 μg/ml of H10 was sufficient toinhibit cancer cell migration in breast and prostate cancer cell lines. A controlpeptide did not show any appreciable activity in these cells. The H10 peptideshowed promise as both a novel diagnostic and a potential therapeutic peptide.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25221 PMCID: PMC6007958PMID: 29937991
