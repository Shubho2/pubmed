Thirty-eight radiomicfeatures were extracted. Tenfold cross validation was performed to assess theability to distinguish between lesions and cancers using maximum linear sizealone and lesion signatures obtained with stepwise feature selection and a lineardiscriminant analysis classifier including and excluding size features. Areaunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the figure ofmerit.RESULTS: For maximum linear size alone, AUC and 95% confidence interval was 0.797(0.754, 0.835) compared to 0.846 (0.808, 0.875) (P = .005) and 0.848 (0.811,0.880) (P = .003) for lesion signature feature selection protocols including and excluding size features, respectively. The irregularity feature was chosen in 9of 10 folds and in all folds when size features were included and excluded,respectively. AUC for the radiomic signature using feature selection from allfeatures was statistically equivalent to using feature selection from allfeatures excluding size features, within an equivalence margin of 2%.CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of multiple radiomic features, automatically extractedfrom magnetic resonance images, in a lesion signature significantly improved the ability to distinguish between benign lesions and luminal A breast cancers,compared to using maximum linear size alone. The radiomic feature of irregularityappears to play an important but not a solitary role within the context offeature selection and computer-aided diagnosis.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.
