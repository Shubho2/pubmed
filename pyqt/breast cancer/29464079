KAI1 acts via physical/functionalcrosstalk with other membrane receptors. Also, a splice variant of KAI1 (KAI1-SP)has been identified indicative of poor prognosis. We here characterizeddifferential effects of the two KAI1 variants on tumor biological eventsinvolving integrin (αvß3) and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R). InMDA-MB-231 and -435 breast cancer cells, differential effects were documented on the expression levels of the tumor biologically relevant integrin αvß3 whichcolocalized with KAI1-WT but not with KAI1-SP. Cellular motility was assessed by video image processing, including motion detection and vector analysis for thequantification and visualization of cell motion parameters. In MDA-MB-231 cells, KAI1-SP provoked a quicker wound gap closure and higher closure rates thanKAI1-WT, also reflected by different velocities and average motion amplitudes of singular cells. KAI1-SP induced highest cell motion adjacent to the wound gapborders, whereas in MDA-MB-435 cells a comparable induction of both KAI1 variantswas noticed. Moreover, while KAI1-WT reduced cell growth, KAI1-SP significantlyincreased it going along with a pronounced EGF-R upregulation. KAI1-SP-inducedcell migration and proliferation was accompanied by the activation of the focaladhesion and Src kinase. Our findings suggest that splicing of KAI1 does not onlyabrogate its tumor suppressive functions, but even more, promotes tumorbiological effects in favor of cancer progression and metastasis.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23968 PMCID: PMC5814219PMID: 29464079
