To explore the changes in gene expression induced by Stxs that have been shown in other systems to correlate with cancerprogression, we performed the simulated analysis of cDNA dataset and founddifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) of human THP1-monocytic cells treated with Stxs. In this study, the entire data (treated and untreated replicates) wasanalyzed by statistical algorithms implemented in Bioconductor packages. Theoutput data was validated by the k-fold cross technique using generalized linear Gaussian models. A total of 50 DEGs were identified. 7 genes including TSLP, IL6,GBP1, CD274, TNFSF13B, OASL, and PNPLA3 were considerably (<0.00005) related tocancer proliferation. The functional enrichment analysis showed 6 down-regulated and 1 up-regulated genes. Among these DEGs, IL6 was associated with severalcancers, especially with leukemia, lymphoma, lungs, liver and breast cancers. Thepredicted regulatory motifs of these genes include conserved RELA, STATI, IRFI,NF-kappaB, PEND, HLF, REL, CEBPA, DI_2, and NFKB1 transcription factor bindingsites (TFBS) involved in the complex biological functions. Thus, our findingssuggest that Stxs has the potential as a valuable tool for better understandingof treatment strategies for several cancers.DOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00380 PMCID: PMC5859033PMID: 29593668
