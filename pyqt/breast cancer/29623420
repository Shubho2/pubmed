Treatment side effects, older age, lack of confidenceand opportunity to exercise with others in similar circumstances influence this. Our study explored the experiences of people attending a cancer-specificcommunity-based exercise programme (CU Fitter™).METHODS: A survey distributed to those attending the programme gathereddemographic/clinical information, self-reported exercise levels, informationprovision and barriers to/benefits of exercise.RESULTS: Sixty surveys were evaluable from 65/100 returned (62% female, 68%> 60 years, 66% breast/prostate cancer). Most (68%) were receiving treatment.Sixty-eight percent attended classes once or twice weekly. Fifty-five percentreceived exercise advice after diagnosis, usually from their hospitaldoctor/nurse. More (73%) had read about exercising, but less used the Internet tosource information (32%). Self-reported exercise levels were higher currentlythan before diagnosis (p = 0.05). Forty-eight percent said their primary barrier to exercising was the physical impact of cancer/treatment. Improvingfitness/health (40%) and social support (16%) were the most important gains from the programme. Many (67%) had made other lifestyle changes and intented to keep(50%) or increase (30%) exercising.CONCLUSIONS: This community-based cancer-specific exercise approach engagedpeople with cancer and showed physical, psychological, and social benefits.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Community-grown exercise initiatives bringcancer survivors together creating their own supportive environment. Combiningthis with instructors familiar with the population and providing an open-endedservice may prove particularly motivating and beneficial. Further work isrequired to provide evidence for this.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4179-0 PMID: 29623420
