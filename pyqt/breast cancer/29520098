Wedemonstrate a high-resolution intravital microscopy technique to quantify glucoseuptake, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and SO2 to characterize the invivo phentoypes of three distinct murine breast cancer lines. Tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) was thoroughly validated to report on MMP in normaland tumor-bearing mice. Imaging MMP or glucose uptake together with vascularendpoints revealed that metastatic 4T1 tumors maintained increased glucose uptakeacross all SO2 ("Warburg effect"), and also showed increased MMP relative tonormal tissue. Non-metastatic 67NR and 4T07 tumor lines both displayed increased MMP, but comparable glucose uptake, relative to normal tissue. The 4T1peritumoral areas also showed a significant glycolytic shift relative to thetumor regions. During a hypoxic stress test, 4T1 tumors showed significantincreases in MMP with corresponding significant drops in SO2, indicative ofintensified mitochondrial metabolism. Conversely, 4T07 and 67NR tumors shiftedtoward glycolysis during hypoxia. Our findings underscore the importance ofimaging metabolic endpoints within the context of a living microenvironment togain insight into a tumor's adaptive behavior.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22480-w PMCID: PMC5843602PMID: 29520098
