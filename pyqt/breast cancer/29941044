We studied the effect of age on locoregional recurrence and thesurvival of Asian breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving therapy.METHODS: Medical records of 2492 patients treated with breast-conserving therapy between 1989 and 2012 were reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimatelocoregional recurrence, breast cancer-free survival, and breast cancer-specific survival rates. These rates were then compared using log-rank tests. Outcomes andage were modeled by Cox proportional hazards. Fractional polynomials were thenused to test for non-linear relationships between age and outcomes.RESULTS: Patients ≤ 40 years old were more likely to have locoregional recurrencethan were older patients (Hazard ratio [HR] = 2.32, P < 0.001). Locoregionalrecurrence rates decreased year-on-year by 4% for patients with luminal-typebreast cancers, compared with 8% for those with triple-negative cancers.Similarly, breast cancer-free survival rates increased year-on-year by 4% versus 8% for luminal-type and triple-negative cancers, respectively. Breastcancer-specific survival rates increased with age by 5% year-on-year. Both breastcancer-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival rates in patients withluminal cancers exhibited a non-linear ("L-shaped") relationship-where decreasingage at presentation was associated with escalating risks of relapse and death.The influence of age on overall survival was confounded by competing non-cancerdeaths in older women, resulting in a "U-shaped" relationship.CONCLUSIONS: Young Asian breast cancer patients have a continuous year-on-yearincrease in rates of disease relapse and cancer deaths compared with olderpatients with no apparent threshold.DOI: 10.1186/s40880-018-0310-3 PMCID: PMC6020242PMID: 29941044
