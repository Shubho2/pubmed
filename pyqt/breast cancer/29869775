Of the 82respondents that regularly include IMLNs, five were removed as those respondents do not treat this population synchronously. Of the 77 respondents, institutional standard of care varied significantly, though VMAT (34%) and combined staticphoton and electron fields (21%) were the most commonly utilized techniques.Respondents did preferentially select target volume coverage (70%) as the mostimportant clinical priority, followed by normal tissue sparing (25%).CONCLUSION: The results of the survey indicate that the IMLN-inclusion forradiation therapy has not yet been comprehensively adopted. As well, no consensuson best practice for radiation therapy treatment techniques has been reached.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4848-1 PMID: 29869775
