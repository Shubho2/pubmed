This raises discussions about how best to maintain a good quality oflife for these patients. Recent data suggest that post-treatment quality of life (QoL) can be maintained using new treatment options, but little data existregarding the QoL in long-term survivors. This study of 19 patients survivinggreater than two years from the initial treatment of brain metastases suggeststhat long-term QoL can be better than at the start of treatment and perhaps even better than normal, especially between three and five years post-treatment. This improved QoL seems mostly attributable to improved functional and socialwell-being and is possible as long as emotional and physical well-being aremaintained within the normal range.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2358 PMCID: PMC5963947PMID: 29805927
