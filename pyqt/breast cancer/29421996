[Epub aheadof print]Role of ABC transporters in veterinary medicine: pharmaco-toxicologicalimplications.Virkel G(1), Ballent M(1), Lanusse C(1), Lifschitz A(1).Author information: (1)CIVETAN-CONICET-CICPBA, FCV-UNCPBA - Laboratorio de Farmacología, Depto.Fisiopatología Tandil, Buenos Aires. Argentina.Unlike physicians, veterinary practitioners must deal with a number of animalspecies with crucial differences in anatomy, physiology and metabolism.Accordingly, the pharmacokinetic behaviour, the clinical efficacy and the adverseor toxic effects of drugs may differ across domestic animals. Moreover, the useof drugs in food-producing species may impose a risk for humans due to thegeneration of chemical residues in edible products, a major concern for publichealth and consumer's safety. As is clearly known in human beings, the ATPbinding cassette (ABC) of transport proteins may influence the bioavailabilityand elimination of numerous drugs and other xenobiotics in domestic animals aswell. A number of drugs, currently available in the veterinary market, aresubstrates of one or more transporters. Therefore, significant drug-druginteractions among ABC substrates may have unpredictable pharmaco-toxicologicalconsequences in different species of veterinary interest. In this context,different investigations revealed the major relevance of P-gp and other transportproteins, like breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrugresistance-associated proteins (MRPs), in both companion and livestock animals.Undoubtedly, the discovery of the ABC transporters and the deep understanding of their physiological role in the different species introduced a new paradigm into the veterinary pharmacology. This review focus on the expression and function of the major transport proteins expressed in species of veterinary interest, andtheir impact in drug disposition, efficacy and toxicity.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/0929867325666180201094730 PMID: 29421996
