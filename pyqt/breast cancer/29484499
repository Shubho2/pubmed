Thisstudy aims to describe sleep disturbance among Chinese breast cancer survivorsand to examine demographic and clinical correlates as well as psychosocialcorrelates of sleep disturbance.METHODS: Data from 80 Chinese breast cancer survivors in the USA completed theChinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index as well as measures ofquality of life, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress. Participants alsocompleted measures of demographic factors and acculturation.RESULTS: Two thirds (66%) of survivors experienced elevated sleep disturbance.Approximately half (49%) reported sleep efficiency, the percentage of time in bedthat is spent asleep, that was below the recommended cutoff. Compared to thosewithout sleep disturbance, those with sleep disturbance had worse quality oflife, more depressive symptoms, and more perceived stress (ps ≤ .01).CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to examine sleep disturbance among anyAsian cancer population in the USA. Findings indicate Chinese breast cancersurvivors may experience significant disparities in sleep disturbance relative tonon-Hispanic Whites and suggest an urgent need for interventions to address sleepdisturbance among Chinese breast cancer survivors.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4128-y PMCID: PMC5924438 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29484499
