Inadequate adherence to medication may cause alterations inrisk-benefit ratios, resulting in reduced benefits, increased risks or both, and is significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes and higher healthcare costs. We aim to examine the effect of a computer generated short message service(SMS) reminder in improving medication adherence, and inhibiting thearomatisation process amongst breast cancer women receiving oral aromataseinhibitor therapy.METHODS/DESIGN: In this randomised controlled trial, eligible patients will beequally allocated to receive either SMS reminder or standard care. The formerreceives weekly SMS reminder to take medication while the latter does not receiveany. The primary endpoint of medication adherence at 1-year is assessed using theSimplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire, and compared using the χ2 test.Adjustment for baseline covariate and potential confounders will be made usingthe logistic regression. Secondary outcomes involving estrone and androstenedionelevels will be compared using the analysis of covariance, whereas the estradiollevels (< 18.4 pmol/L versus ≥18.4 pmol/L) will be compared using the χ2 test,and the logistic regression. Further, the assessment of knowledge, attitude,behaviour, and barriers and facilitating factors of medication adherence will be made via logistic regression.DISCUSSION: This will be the first study to evaluate short-term clinical outcomesfrom SMS reminder for breast cancer patients on aromatase inhibitor therapy.Random allocation to SMS reminder or control arm ensures that patients in botharms will be comparable with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics,and any difference in outcomes can be attributed to the intervention.Participants are not blinded to the assignment of intervention, thus there may bepotential for bias in outcome assessments.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02524548 .
