All PET/MRI examinations were assessedfor local tumor burden and metastatic spread in two separate reading sessions:(1) One-step algorithm comprising supine whole-body 18F-FDG PET/MRI, and (2)Two-step algorithm comprising a dedicated prone 18F-FDG breast PET/MRI and supinewhole-body 18F-FDG PET/MRI.RESULTS: On a patient based analysis the two-step algorithm correctly identified 37 out of 38 patients with breast carcinoma (97%), while five patients weremissed by the one-step 18F-FDG PET/MRI algorithm (33/38; 87% correctidentification). On a lesion-based analysis 56 breast cancer lesions weredetected in the two-step algorithm and 44 breast cancer lesions could becorrectly identified in the one-step 18F-FDG PET/MRI (79%), resulting instatistically significant differences between the two algorithms (p = 0.0015).For axillary lymph node evaluation sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was 93%,95 and 94%, respectively. Furthermore, distant metastases could be detected inseven patients in both algorithms.CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the necessity and superiority of a two-step18F-FDG PET/MRI algorithm, comprising dedicated prone breast imaging and supinewhole-body imaging, when compared to the one-step algorithm for local andwhole-body staging in breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1007/s00259-018-4102-4 PMID: 30056547
