The 70% ethanolic extract from the rizhomes of Cimicifuga dahurica(Turcz.) Maxim. (Ranunculaceae) was found to possess significant in vitroanti-proliferative effects on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. A phytochemicalinvestigation using assay-guided fractionation of the ethanolic extract of C.dahurica resulted in the isolation of one new phenolic amide glycoside 3, two newlignan glycosides 4 and 7, one new 9,19-cycloartane triterpenoid glycoside 6, andthirteen known constituents 1, 2, 5, and 8⁻17. The structures of 3, 4, 6, and 7were established using contemporary NMR methods and from their HRESIMS data. The anti-proliferative effects of isolated compounds were evaluated using theBrdU-proliferation kit. Five among the 17 isolated compounds showed significantanti-proliferative effects (p &le; 0.05), wherein compound 7 showed the mostsignificant anti-proliferative and cell cycle arresting effect (p &le; 0.05)which followed a dose dependent manner. Western blot protein expression analysis showed a down expression of c-Myc and cyclin D1 which further elucidated theanti-proliferation mechanism of compound 7 while apoptotic effects were found in association with Bcl-2 family protein expression variations. Conclusively thisstudy reports the isolation and identification of 17 compounds from C. dahurica, including four novel molecules, in addition to the fact that compound 7 possessessignificant anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in vitro that may requirefurther exploration.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23051083 PMID: 29734650
