However, its function in breast cancer isunknown. Here we aim to explore the role of AMPH-1 in breast cancer cells.Knockdown of AMPH-1 in breast cancer cells promotes cell proliferation, cellcycle progression and cell migration, and attenuates cell apoptosis. Of note,knockdown of AMPH-1 promotes breast cancer progression in xenograft mouse model. These oncogenic phenotypes may be partially due to the activated EMT and ERKpathways after inhibition of AMPH-1. Oncomine analyses of multiple breast cancer patient datasets show that reduced AMPH-1 mRNA level is significantly associated with breast cancer patients having metastatic events, advanced stage, poorclinical outcomes, and Paclitaxel+FEC treatment resistance. In summary, ourresults identified the anti-oncogenic function of AMPH-1 in breast cancer invitro and in vivo. Activation of AMPH-1 may be a promising approach to treatbreast cancer patients.DOI: 10.7150/jca.25428 PMCID: PMC6010687PMID: 29937937
