In manycases BC has shown resistance to chemotherapy, radiation and hormonal therapy.Development of new, cost effective, affordable treatment method is the need ofhour. Chemical compounds isolated from plants are often biologically active andis attracting the attention of scientific community. Different in vitro and invivo studies have shown a potential role in reducing the risk of cancermetastasis. Large number of phytochemicals are considered to regulate severalmolecular and metabolic processes like cell cycle regulation, apoptosisactivation, angiogenesis and metastatic suppression that can hinders cancerprogression. An extensive review of literature has been conducted to underlinethe key phytochemicals and their mechanism of action. This review article hasdiscussed in detail the regulatory roles of phytochemicals, their analogs andnanoformulations and the probability of using phytochemicals in therapeuticmanagement of BC. Finally, current limitations, challenges and futureperspectives of these phytochemicals are also critically discussed.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
