The objectives of the current study were to evaluate employment trajectories in a cohort ofpatients with early-stage breast cancer and age-matched controls from the time ofdiagnosis to the 2-year follow-up, and identify factors associated withdiminished and emerging employment participation.METHODS: As part of a larger cohort study of 1096 patients with early-stagebreast cancer and same-aged women without breast cancer, data from 723working-age (aged 40-64 years) women (347 patients and 376 controls) wereanalyzed to evaluate 4 employment trajectories (sustained unemployment,diminished employment, emerging employment, and sustained employment).Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associatedwith diminished employment versus sustained employment, and emerging employmentversus sustained unemployment.RESULTS: Lower percentages of patients (71%) compared with controls (79%)reported full-time or part-time employment at enrollment (P<.01). Fatigue was asignificant predictor of diminished employment for both patients (odds ratio[OR], 5.71; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.48-13.15) and controls (OR, 2.38;95% CI, 1.21-4.68). Among patients, African American race (OR, 4.02; 95% CI,1.57-10.28) and public/uninsured insurance status (OR, 4.76; 95% CI, 1.34-12.38) were found to be associated with diminished employment. Among controls, highsocial support was associated with emerging employment (OR, 3.12; 95% CI,1.25-7.79).CONCLUSIONS: Fatigued patients, African American patients, and publiclyinsured/uninsured patients with cancer were more likely to experience diminished employment after 2 years of follow-up. Further investigation with longerfollow-up is warranted to identify factors associated with these disparities inemployment participation after treatment of early-stage breast cancer.
