Randomization (1:1) was to MF or E,applied twice daily from day 1 of PMRT to 14 days after PMRT. Patients werestratified by RT technique, body mass index, and reconstruction status. Dailybolus of 3 to 10 mm was applied in all patients. The primary endpoint was thedevelopment of provider-assessed grade ≥2 (Common Terminology Criteria forAdverse Events version 4.03) ARD with moist desquamation or any grade ≥3dermatitis. Secondary endpoints were time to occurrence of maximum-gradedermatitis and patient-reported skin symptoms using a skin-related quality oflife questionnaire, Skindex-16. Assessments were performed at baseline, weeklyduring PMRT, and 2 weeks after PMRT.RESULTS: 124 patients were enrolled between May 2013 and February 2016. Of those,35% had pathologic stage III disease, 6% had cT4d disease, and 68% underwentreconstruction. Sixty percent received 3-dimensional conformal RT with photonsonly to the chest wall, 18% received electrons and photons, and 23% receivedinverse-planned intensity modulated RT. Groups were well balanced for age, skintype, and stage. The rate of moist desquamation was 54.8% in the entire cohort,with a significantly reduced incidence in the MF arm than in the E arm (43.8% vs 66.7%; P = .012). The MF arm had a lower incidence of maximum skin toxicities(P = .036) and longer time to development of grade 3 dermatitis (46 days vs35.5 days, respectively; P ≤ .001). There was no difference in patient-reportedskin outcomes between arms.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients receiving MF during PMRT experiencedsignificantly reduced rates of moist desquamation in comparison with a controlcream.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2018.02.006 PMID: 29726361
