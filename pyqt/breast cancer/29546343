The current analysis reports onendocrine data of patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure whowere included in the phase III DATA study assessing different durations ofadjuvant anastrozole after tamoxifen.Methods: We identified all patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian functionfailure. Women who underwent a bilateral ovariectomy or used luteinizinghormone-releasing hormone agonists before random assignment were excluded. Plasmaestradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were monitored until 30 months after random assignment at local laboratories. We aimed to determine the ovarian function recovery (OFR) rate during AI use by the cumulative incidence competing risk method and analyzed the trend of estradiol levels during AI use by a nested case-control approach in which a subset of control subjects were compared withthe OFR patients excluding the value at OFR diagnosis.Results: The 329 eligible patients had a median age of 50.0 years (range = 45-57 years) at random assignment. Thirty-nine patients developed OFR, correspondingwith a 30-month recovery rate of 12.4%. Of these, 11 (28.2%) were age 50 years orolder at AI initiation. The estradiol level decreased statistically significantlyby 37.8% (95% CI = 27.4% to 46.7%) over the initial 30 months of AI treatment in both groups. However, the estradiol levels in the women who experienced OFRremained statistically significantly higher (difference = 20.6%, 95% CI = 2.0% to42.7%) prior to OFR diagnosis compared with those who did not experience OFR.Conclusions: The risk of OFR during AI treatment in breast cancer patients withchemotherapy-induced ovarian function failure is relevant, even beyond 45 years. Furthermore, women experiencing OFR had statistically significant higherestradiol levels during AI treatment (before OFR) than those without, withpotential consequences regarding efficacy.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djx074 PMID: 29546343
