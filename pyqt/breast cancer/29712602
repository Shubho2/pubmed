The use of frozen section (FS) pathologic analysis of theprimary tumor may allow for selective surgical nodal staging within oneprocedure. We sought to define the reliability of FS for detection of upstaging. Eight hundred and twenty-seven patients were identified with DCIS on core needle biopsy that underwent 834 operations at our institution between January 2004 and October 2014. We calculated the rate of upstage from DCIS to invasive cancer onboth intraoperative FS and final pathology to determine the performance of FS.Upstage rate on final pathology was 118/834 (14.1%) 95 per cent confidenceinterval 11.8 to 16.7 per cent. FS identified 88/118 (74.6%) of the upstages.Specificity was 99.3 per cent (711/716). Overall accuracy was 95.8 per cent(799/834) and the positive predictive value was 96.0 per cent (711/741 patients).Mean size of invasive cancers identified on FS was 5.6 mm, versus 3.5 mm forthose identified only on permanent section, P = 0.11. Intraoperative FS analysis of DCIS is useful for identification of upstage to invasive disease. This mayfacilitate a selective approach to SLN surgery that both decreases unnecessarySLN surgery and the need for a second operation.PMID: 29712602  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
