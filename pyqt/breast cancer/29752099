Ajmer, Rajasthan 305 817, India.Electronic address: drkaisar@curaj.ac.in.Our aim was to develop multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-based nanoconstructsfor the codelivery of N-desmethyl tamoxifen (N-TAM) and a mild P-gp effluxinhibitor, i.e., quercetin (QT) to treat multiple drug resistant (MDR) cancercells. The hypothesis banks on three-tier attack on the MDR mechanisms viz. drug derivatization, MWCNT permeation and P-gp inhibition. Tamoxifen was converted to N-TAM and was conjugated to carboxylated MWCNTs mediated by a biodegradablelinker, i.e., tetraethylene glycol (TEG). QT was adsorbed on the conjugate tofetch the final product, i.e., N-TAM-TEG-MWCNT-QT. Spectroscopic analysisconfirmed successful conjugation of N-TAM and physical adsorption of QT. Thein-vitro release of N-TAM from the N-TAM-TEG-MWCNT conjugate was minimal to that of pure drug under physiological conditions, but markedly enhanced under theacidic pH of cancer cells. The developed nanometeric formulation was found to be haemo-compatible. Reduced IC50values and better cellular uptake in drug resistantMDA-MB-231 cells were observed, followed by enhanced drug availability in thesystemic circulation of rodents vis-à-vis naïve drug. The smart nanosystemconferred the desired temporal drug delivery, enhanced drug efficacy,biocompatibility and conducive pharmacokinetics, which are the crucial desiredattributes to tackle the increasing concern of MDR in cancer chemotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
