Effects of sex hormones such asestrogens and progesterone have been well described to have a critical impact on breast cancer proliferation. However, the complex network of the chromatinlandscape, enhancer regions and mode of function of steroid receptors (SRs) andother transcription factors (TFs), is an intricate web of signaling andfunctional processes that is still largely misunderstood at the mechanisticlevel. In this review, we describe what is currently known about the dynamicinterplay between TFs with chromatin and the reprogramming of enhancer elements. Emphasis has been placed on characterizing the different modes of action of TFsin regulating enhancer activity, specifically, how different SRs target enhancer regions to reprogram chromatin in breast cancer cells. In addition, we discusscurrent techniques employed to study enhancer function at a genome-wide level.Further, we have noted recent advances in live cell imaging technology. Thesesingle-cell approaches enable the coupling of population-based assays withreal-time studies to address many unsolved questions about SRs and chromatindynamics in breast cancer.Â© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-18-0033 PMCID: PMC6029727 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29692347
