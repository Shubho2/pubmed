Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.Brian.Czerniecki@moffitt.org.BACKGROUND: Although immunotherapy is making rapid inroads as a major treatmentmethod for melanoma, lung, bladder, and hereditary colon cancer, breast cancer(BC) remains one of the tumors yet to experience the cellular immunologyexplosion despite the fact that heavy lymphocyte responses in breast tumorsimprove response to therapy and can predict for long-term survival.RESULTS: Immunotherapies in the form of monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumaband pertuzumab have had an impact on HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2+BC)treatment through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Current evidencesuggests that checkpoint inhibitors and other cellular therapies are at thedoorstep of improving outcomes in triple-negative BC (TNBC) and HER2+BC,especially when combined with standard therapies.CONCLUSIONS: Although this approach has benefitted small numbers of patients todate, numerous clinical trials are underway to define the relative roleimmunotherapy may play in the treatment of BC.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6620-5 PMID: 30014455
