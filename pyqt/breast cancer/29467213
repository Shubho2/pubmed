In the present study,the basal activity of the ABCG2 promoter in liver, kidney, intestine, and breast cell lines was examined using luciferase reporter assays. The promoter activitiesof reference and variant ABCG2 sequences were compared in human hepatocellularcarcinoma cell (HepG2), human embryonic kidney cell (HEK293T), human colorectalcarcinoma cell (HCT116), and human breast adenocarcinoma cell (MCF-7) lines. The ABCG2 promoter activity was strongest in the kidney and intestine cell lines.Four variants in the basal ABCG2 promoter (rs76656413, rs66664036, rs139256004,and rs59370292) decreased the promoter activity by 25%-50% in at least three ofthe four cell lines. The activity of these four variants was also examined invivo using the hydrodynamic tail vein assay, and two single nucleotidepolymorphisms (rs76656413 and rs59370292) significantly decreased in vivo liverpromoter activity by 50%-80%. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed areduction in nuclear protein binding to the rs59370292 variant probe, whereas thers76656413 probe had a shift in transcription factor binding specificity.Although both rs59370292 and rs76656413 are rare variants in all populations,they could contribute to patient-level variation in ABCG2 expression in thekidney, liver, and intestine.Copyright Â© 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/dmd.117.079541 PMCID: PMC5896364 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29467213
