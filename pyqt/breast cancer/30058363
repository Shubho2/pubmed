[Epub ahead of print]Immunogenicity assessment of tbo-filgrastim in cancer patients receivingchemotherapy.Zou L(1), Buchner A(2), Field JA(1), Barash S(3), Liu PM(1).Author information: (1)Biologics Assays & Technology, Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., West Chester, PA19380, USA.(2)Clinical Development, Merckle GmbH, Ulm, Germany.(3)Global Statistics, Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc., West Chester, PA, USA.AIM: This integrated analysis examined the immunogenicity of tbo-filgrastim andits potential clinical impact in three Phase III randomized studies in patientswith breast cancer, lung cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving chemotherapy.RESULTS: Treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies (ADA) occurred in 3/213 (1.4%)breast cancer patients, 2/160 (1.3%) lung cancer patients and 1/63 (1.6%)patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. None of the treatment-emergent ADA showedcross-reactivity toward native granulocyte-colony stimulating factors orexhibited neutralizing activity against tbo-filgrastim. Among patients withtreatment-emergent ADA, there was no treatment-related hypersensitivity oranaphylaxis and no evidence of loss of clinical efficacy.CONCLUSION: Tbo-filgrastim has demonstrated low immunogenicity in cancer patientsreceiving chemotherapy and ADA response does not impact safety and efficacy inthe patients.DOI: 10.4155/bio-2018-0071 PMID: 30058363
