[Epub ahead of print]High turnover of extracellular matrix reflected by specific protein fragmentsmeasured in serum is associated with poor outcomes in two metastatic breastcancer cohorts.Lipton A(1), Leitzel K(1), Ali SM(2), Polimera HV(1), Nagabhairu V(3), MarksE(1), Richardson AE(1), Krecko L(1), Ali A(1), Koestler W(4), Esteva FJ(5),Leeming DJ(6), Karsdal MA(6), Willumsen N(6).Author information: (1)Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA, USA.(2)Lebanon VA Medical Center, Lebanon, PA, USA.(3)Pinnacle Health System, Harrisburg, PA, USA.(4)Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.(5)New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.(6)Nordic Bioscience A/S, Herlev, Denmark.Increased extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and matrix metalloprotease(MMP)-mediated ECM degradation are parts of tumorgenesis and generates specificcollagen fragments that are released into circulation. We evaluated theassociation of specific collagen fragments measured in serum with outcomes in twoindependent metastatic breast cancer (MBC) cohorts. ELISAs were used to measureC1M (MMP-generated type I collagen fragment), C3M (MMP-generated type IIIcollagen fragment), C4M (MMP-generated type IV collagen fragment), and PRO-C3(pro-peptide of type III collagen) in pre-treatment serum from a phase 3randomized clinical trial of 2nd -line hormone therapy (HR+, n= 148), and a 1st-line trastuzumab-treated cohort (HER2+, n=55). All sites of metastases wereincluded. The collagen fragments were evaluated by Cox-regression analysis fortheir association with time-to-progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). Inthe HR+ cohort, higher C1M and C3M levels (75th percentile cut-off) wereassociated with shorter TTP; all fragments were associated with shorter OS. Inthe HER2+ cohort, higher levels of all fragments were associated with shorterTTP; higher PRO-C3 was associated with shorter OS. In multivariate analysis ofthe HR+ trial for OS, higher levels of all fragments were significant for reducedOS when added separately (C1M HR=2.1, p<0.001; C3M HR=1.8, p=0.028; C4M HR=1.8,p=0.018; PRO-C3 HR=1.8, p=0.017); none other clinical covariates weresignificant. In conclusion, collagen fragments quantified in pre-treatment serum was associated with shorter TTP and OS in two independent MBC cohorts receivingsystemic therapy. If validated, quantification of ECM remodeling in serum haspotential as prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers in MBC. This article isprotected by copyright.
