China.Deregulation of msh homeobox 1 (MSX1) has been identified to be associated withmultiple human malignant neoplasms. However, the association of the expressionand biological function of MSX1 with breast tumorigenesis, and the underlyingmechanism remain largely unknown. Therefore, the present study examined theexpression and promoter methylation of MSX1 in breast tumor cell lines, primarybreast tumors and normal breast tissues using semi-quantitative, quantitative andmethylation-specific reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction. Colonyformation assays, flow cytometric analysis, and wound healing and Transwellassays were used to assess various functions of MSX1. Western blot analyses were also conducted to explore the mechanism of MSX1. The results revealed that MSX1was broadly expressed in normal human tissues, including breast tissues, but was frequently downregulated or silenced in breast cancer cell lines and primarytumors by promoter methylation. Methylation of the MSX1 promoter was observed in 7/9 (77.8%) breast cancer cell lines and 47/99 (47.5%) primary tumors, but not innormal breast tissues or surgical margin tissues, suggesting that tumor-specific methylation of MSX1 occurs in breast cancer. Pharmacological demethylationreduced MSX1 promoter methylation levels and restored the expression of MSX1. Theectopic expression of MSX1, induced by transfection with a lentiviral vector,significantly inhibited the clonogenicity, proliferation, migration and invasion of breast tumor cells by inducing G1/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. EctopicMSX1 expression also inhibited the expression of active β-catenin and itsdownstream targets c-Myc and cyclin D1, and also increased the cleavage ofcaspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. In conclusion, MSX1 exertstumor-suppressive functions by inducing G1/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis inbreast tumorigenesis. Its methylation may be used as an epigenetic biomarker for the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3468 PMID: 29436596
