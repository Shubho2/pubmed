Dryness, skin colour and skin thickness were objectively measured using non-invasive instruments. The patients were assessed for differencesbetween their treated and untreated breasts.Results: Skin atrophy was not noticed in any of the 60 patients. Objectiveinstrumental measurements did not reveal any significant differences in skindryness, colour, pigmentation or skin thickness over the average follow-up timeof six years. Clinical assessment based on the RTOG scoring system revealed that the odds ratio of having late skin problems in patients treated with moisturizer compared to patients treated with corticosteroid was 3.2 (95% CI:1.0-10.1).Patients reported minor cosmetic dermatological sequelae. Sevenpatients developed telangiectasia, which caused cosmetic inconvenience.Conclusion: In this study, prophylactic corticosteroid treatment to ameliorateradiation dermatitis during adjuvant ERT of breast cancer was not associated withan increase in late skin toxicity nor did it result in skin atrophy. This studyis limited by its small sample size, and the risk for false positive findings.DOI: 10.1016/j.ctro.2017.09.001 PMCID: PMC5862647PMID: 29594223
