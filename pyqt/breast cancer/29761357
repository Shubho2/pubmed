These lesions were segmented in 2D and 3D to compare thediscriminative power of 2D and 3D texture features. The images were quantizedusing different number of gray-levels to test the influence of quantization.Forty-three rotation-invariant texture features were examined. Feature selection and random forest classification were implemented within a nestedcross-validation structure. Classification was evaluated with the area underreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) considering two strategies:multiclass and one-versus-one.RESULTS: In the multiclass approach, 3D texture features were more discriminativethan 2D features. The best results were achieved for images quantized with 32gray-levels (AUC = 0.873 ± 0.064) using the top four features provided by thefeature selection method based on the p-value. In the one-versus-one approach,high accuracy was obtained when differentiating lung cancer BM from breast cancerBM (four features, AUC = 0.963 ± 0.054) and melanoma BM (eight features, AUC =0.936 ± 0.070) using the optimal dataset (3D features, 32 gray-levels).Classification of breast cancer and melanoma BM was unsatisfactory (AUC = 0.607 ±0.180).CONCLUSION: Volumetric MRI texture features can be useful to differentiate brain metastases from different primary cancers after quantizing the images with theproper number of gray-levels.KEY POINTS: • Texture analysis is a promising source of biomarkers forclassifying brain neoplasms. • MRI texture features of brain metastases couldhelp identifying the primary cancer. • Volumetric texture features are morediscriminative than traditional 2D texture features.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5463-6 PMID: 29761357
