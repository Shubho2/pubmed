Between 2011 and 2015, we enrolled 12 consecutive patients who hadlesions with NME that exceeded the US hypo-echoic area, in which it wasparticularly difficult to evaluate the tumor margin. During pre-operativeplanning before breast-conserving surgery, RVS was used to delineate theenhancing area on the breast surface after additional supine breast MRI wasperformed. We analyzed both the surgical margin positivity rate and there-operation rate. All NME lesions corresponded to the index cancer. In allpatients, the diameter of the NME lesion was greater than that of the hypo-echoiclesion. The median diameters of the NME and hypo-echoic lesions were 24 mm(range: 12-39 mm) and 8.0 mm (range: 4.9-18 mm), respectively (p = 0.0002). AfterRVS-derived skin marking was performed on the surface of the affected breast,lumpectomy and quadrantectomy were conducted in 7 and 5 patients, respectively.The surgical margins were negative in 10 (83%) patients. Two patients withpositive margins were found to have ductal carcinoma in situ in 1 duct each, 2.4 and 3.2 mm from the resection margin, respectively. None of the patients requiredadditional resection. Although further prospective studies are required, thefindings of our preliminary study suggest that it is very well possible that the use of RVS-derived skin marking during pre-operative planning for BCS in patientswith NME would have resulted in surgical outcomes similar to or better than thoseobtained without the use of such marking.Copyright © 2018.
