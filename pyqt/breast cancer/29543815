Thisprospective hospital registry-based case-control study aimed to investigate thesero-epidemiological association between chronic HBV infection and various types of cancer.METHODS: 95,034 patients with first-diagnosed non-hepatocellular malignancy in a tertiary hospital between 2007 and 2014; and 118,891 non-cancer individuals ascontrols from a health promotion center were included. Cases and controls werecompared for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity by conditional regressionwith adjustment for age, hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, alcoholconsumption, smoking status and cholesterol level in both genders.RESULTS: An analysis of matched data indicated significant associations of HBVinfection with lymphoma (adjusted odds ratio[AOR] 1.53 [95% CI 1.12-2.09] in men and 3.04 [1.92-4.82] in women) and biliary cancer (2.59[1.98-3.39] in men and1.71[1.16-2.51] in women). Cervical (1.49[1.11-2.00]), uterine (1.69[1.09-2.61]),breast (1.16[1.02-1.32]), thyroid (1.49[1.28-1.74]), and lung cancers(1.79[1.32-2.44]) in women; and skin cancer (5.33[1.55-18.30]) in men were alsosignificantly related to HBV infection.CONCLUSIONS: Chronic HBV infection is associated with several malignant disordersincluding lymphoma, and biliary, cervical, uterine, breast, thyroid, lung, andskin cancers. Our findings may offer additional insights into the development of these neoplasms and may suggest the need to consider HBV screening in cancerpatients and cancer surveillance in HBV-infected subjects.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193232 PMCID: PMC5854295PMID: 29543815  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
