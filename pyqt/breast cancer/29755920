We performed untargeted metabolomics using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in two invasive ascidian species to investigate theinter-specific chemical diversity of Phallusia nigra and P. arabica in search of drug-like properties and metabolic pathways. The chemical profiling of individualascidian species was obtained using GC-MS, and the metabolites were determined bysearching in NIST library and literature data. The principal component analysisof GC-MS mass spectral variables showed a clear discrimination of these twoascidian species based on the chemical composition and taxonomy. The metabolites,lipids, macrolides, and steroids contributed strongly to the discrimination ofthese two species. Results of this study confirmed that GC-MS-based chemicalprofiling could be utilized as a tool for chemotaxonomic classification ofascidian species. The extract of P. nigra showed promising anti-tumor activityagainst HT29 colon cancer 35 µM and MCF7-breast cancer (34.76 µM) cells compared to P. arabica. Of the more than 70 metabolites measured, 18 metabolites thatmapped various pathways linked to three metabolic pathways being impacted andaltered in steroid biosynthesis, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and steroidhormone biosynthesis were observed to have changed significantly (p > 0.004,FDR < 0.01). Also, higher expression of this pathway was associated with moresignificant cytotoxicity in breast and colon carcinoma cells.DOI: 10.1007/s13205-018-1273-4 PMCID: PMC5945559 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29755920
