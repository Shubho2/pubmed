Since April 2009, we have been referring young patients forfertility counseling provided by a multidisciplinary team. Here we evaluated the efficacy and safety of our current fertility preservation approach. Weretrospectively analyzed the cases of 277 patients < 45 years old at diagnosis,which was made between 2009 and 2016. Seventy-two (26%) patients receivedfertility counseling. Seventeen (6%) of the 277 patients decided to preservetheir fertility before starting adjuvant systemic therapy. Six (35%) patientsunderwent oocyte cryopreservation, and 11 (65%) married patients opted for embryocryopreservation. There were no pregnancies among the patients undergoing oocyte cryopreservation, whereas 3 (27%) of the patients who opted for embryocryopreservation became pregnant. Two (12%) patients stopped endocrine therapyafter 2 years in an effort to become pregnant, but their breast cancers recurred.Though the problem of fertility loss for breast cancer patients is important and we should assess the infertility risk for all patients, we should also considerthe prognosis. In June 2016, we launched a prospective multicenter cohort studyto evaluate the efficacy and safety of fertility preservation in greater detail.DOI: 10.18926/AMO/55854 PMID: 29674762
