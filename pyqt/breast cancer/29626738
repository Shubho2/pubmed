Program costs wereestimated by using data from interviews with program administrative staff.Screening and treatment costs were estimated by using Ministry of Health medical reimbursement data. Estimates for expected rates of downstaging were modeled onthe basis of data from a previous study. ROI, or relative cost savings, wascalculated by comparing treatment cost savings to costs for the screeningprogram. A baseline ROI for facility-based screening was calculated, followed by ROIs for different scenarios.RESULTS: Average per-person treatment cost for screened and unscreened patientswas estimated to be $28,632 and $58,170, respectively, with a cumulative lifetimerisk of 6.36%. Total screening program cost per person was $112.10. The studyestimated an expected decrease in late-stage breast cancer diagnosis by 13.7% as a result of the screening program, saving $4,049 in treatment costs perindividual diagnosed. The analysis resulted in a positive ROI of 133% forfacility-based screening.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer represents an increasing burden on health care inEgypt and other developing countries. This study concludes that a community-baseddownstaging program resulted in a positive ROI, or overall cost-savings. Thefindings inform that policymakers in low-income and middle-income countries mayconsider implementing community-based downstaging programs for breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018.
