Herein, we discuss the clinical,histopathological and genetic profile of a woman diagnosed with TNBC. Since thepatient had no durable response to chemotherapy, a genetic profiling was carried out. Next-generation sequencing analysis of 592 genes showed a missense mutation,p.E545A in PIK3CA, thus the patient was started on the mTOR inhibitor everolimus,in combination with exemestane, which controlled her pain; however, the diseaseprogressed aggressively. More importantly, next-generation sequencing analysisshowed a RICTOR gene amplification (eight copies)Â suggesting that RICTOR promotesthe genesis of TNBC. We conclude that determining regulators of RICTOR andfurthermore, their inhibitors might decrease cancer cells proliferation rate inpatients with TNBC.DOI: 10.2217/pgs-2018-0019 PMID: 29790419
