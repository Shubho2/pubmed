Despite its cytotoxicity, cells can develop drugresistance to Doxorubicin. Uncovering pathways and mechanisms involved in drugresistance is an urgent and critical aim for breast cancer research oriented toimprove treatment efficacy. Here we show that Doxorubicin and otherchemotherapeutic drugs induce the expression of ETV7, a transcriptional repressormember of ETS family of transcription factors. The ETV7 expression led to DNAJC15down-regulation, a co-chaperone protein whose low expression was previouslyassociated with drug resistance in breast and ovarian cancer. There was acorresponding reduction in Doxorubicin sensitivity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We identified the binding site for ETV7 within DNAJC15 promoter andwe also found that DNA methylation may be a factor in ETV7-mediated DNAJC15transcriptional repression. These findings of an inverse correlation between ETV7and DNAJC15 expression in MCF7 cells in terms of Doxorubicin resistance,correlated well with treatment responses of breast cancer patients with recurrentdisease, based on our analyses of reported genome-wide expression arrays.Moreover, we demonstrated that ETV7-mediated Doxorubicin-resistance involvesincreased Doxorubicin efflux via nuclear pumps, which could be rescued in part byDNAJC15 up-regulation. With this study, we propose a novel role for ETV7 inbreast cancer, and we identify DNAJC15 as a new target gene responsible forETV7-mediated Doxorubicin-resistance. A better understanding of the opposingimpacts of Doxorubicin could improve the design of combinatorial adjuvantregimens with the aim of avoiding resistance and relapse.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
