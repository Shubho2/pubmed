In this review, we discuss the fundamentalfunctions of lncRNAs at different regulatory levels and their roles in metabolic balance. Typical examples are introduced to illustrate their diverse molecularmechanisms. The comprehensive investigation and identification of key lncRNAswill not only contribute to insights into diseases, such as breast cancer andtype II diabetes, but also provide promising therapeutic targets for relateddiseases.
