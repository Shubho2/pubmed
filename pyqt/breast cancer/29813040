In 78 (73,5%) patients thetumor was diagnosed incidentally on mammography or ultrasound scan, 28 (26,5%)had palpable lesion. 57 patients had the tumor in the left breast and 49 in theright one. Most often the tumor was localized in external quadrants, namely in 56(52,8%) patients. All patients had breast conserving surgery and then adjuvantradiotherapy of the breast in typical doses. For evaluation of survival we usedthe Kaplan-Meier test and for evaluation of cumulated loco-regional recurrence wehave applied the method of competing risks.RESULTS: At present 101 patients are still alive, 85 have no relapse. 15 patientshad local recurrence and 8 had another cancer. Five patients died duringfollow-up period. Overall 15-years survival in analyzed group was 88% and diseasefree survival was 74%. Of all prognostic factors only the value of Van Nuys indexwas relevant. Patients who had the index value less than 7 had significantlyworse prognosis than patients with value 7 or more (p=0,043).CONCLUSIONS: At present 101 patients are still alive, 85 have no relapse. 15patients had local recurrence and 8 had another cancer.
