The goal of this study was to explore the effects of phthalates onthe growth of normal MCF-10A breast cells modulated by breast fibroblasts.Fibroblasts were derived from normal mammary tissue adjacent to both estrogenreceptor (ER) positive and negative primary breast cancers, which were grownseparately from nontumorigenic MCF-10A epithelial cells. MCF-10A co-culture cellswere treated with 10 nM 17β-estradiol (E2), Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP),di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP), and di(20ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) (10 and 100nM). After incubation for 120 hours, the cells were harvested and extracted forMTT assay. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the proliferative pathwayproteins and the effects on ER α. Only fibroblasts from ER (+) breast cancersignificantly stimulated proliferation of MCF-10A cells. Exposure of theco-culture to E2, BBP, DBP, DEHP, and E2 combined with one of these phthalatesresulted in significantly increased cell proliferation, as well as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and ER α expressions. The present study demonstrates that phthalates express a significant influence in fibroblast-epithelialinteractions, similarly to the effects of E2 on breast cells. The effects ofphthalates on normal breast cells depend upon ER modulating actions. In breastcarcinogenesis, phthalates should be considered as having endocrine disruptingpotential, even at low concentrations.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199596 PMCID: PMC6016934PMID: 29940022
