The blocking effects of ataxia telangiectasia mutated andRad3-related kinase (ATM/ATR) inhibitor caffeine and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)inhibitor pynolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) on etoposide-upregulated MICA/B mRNA and surface protein expressions were investigated. Electrophoretic mobility shiftassay (EMSA) was taken to investigate whether etoposide enhanced the binding ofNF-κB to MICA/B gene promoter.RESULTS: Three topoisomerase inhibitors etoposide, camptothecin and doxorubicine upregulated MICA and MICB mRNA expressions in breast cancer cell MCF-7. Comparingto no-drug-treated cells, MICA mRNA levels increased to (1.68±0.17), (2.54±0.25) and (3.42±0.15) fold, and levels of MICB mRNA increased to (1.82±0.24),(1.56±0.05) and (5.84±0.57) fold respectively in cancer cells treated byetoposide at the concentrations of 5, 20 and 100 μmol/L (P<0.05). MICA and MICBmRNA levels also increased significantly when MCF-7 cells were incubated withcamptothecin or doxorubicine at the specific concentrations (P<0.05). MICB mRNAexpression also increased slightly in another breast cancer cell SK-BR-3 treated by topoisomerase II inhibitors etoposide and camptothecin (P<0.05). Furthermore, etoposide and camptothecin upregulated MICA/B surface protein expression in MCF-7cells (P<0.05), and the upregulation was found in both living and apoptoticcells. Our study showed that etoposide induced-MICA/B expression in MCF-7 wasinhibited by caffeine at different concentrations. When cancer cells were treatedby caffeine with 1, 5 and 10 mmol/L, MICA mRNA levels decreased from (3.75±0.25) to (0.89±0.05), (0.81±0.02) and (0.48±0.04) fold respectively (P<0.001), and MICBmRNA levels decreased from (6.85±0.35) to (1.36±0.13), (0.76±0.06) and(0.56±0.03) fold (P<0.05), while MICA/B protein levels decreased from (3.42±0.05)to (1.32±0.03), (1.21±0.06) and (1.14±0.03) fold (P<0.001), indicating thatetoposide-induced MICA/B expression was inhibited by ATM/ATR inhibitor.Similarly, NF-κB inhibitor PDTC also inhibited MICA/B mRNA and proteinexpressions induced by etoposide significantly when MCF-7 cells were incubatedwith PDTC at the concentrations of 10, 50 and 100 μmol/L (P<0.05), indicatingthat NF-κB was also involved in this process. EMSA showed that the binding ofNF-κB to MICA/B promoter enhanced in MCF-7 cells after etoposide treatment.CONCLUSION: Topoisomerase inhibitor increased MICA/B mRNA and protein expressionsin breast cancer cells, indicating that chemotherapeutic agents might increasethe recognizing and killing ability of immunocytes to breast cancer cells.ATM/ATR and NF-κB pathways might be involved in it.PMID: 29643533
