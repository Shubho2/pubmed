We investigated the depth of tumor invasion and tumor size in resectedspecimens from patients with gastric cancer and assessed the clinical utility of primary tumor score (PTS) calculated by tumor depth and size as a prognosticmarker. We classified 247 patients with gastric cancer into three groups based oncut-off values for deeper tumor invasion (pT2-T4) and larger tumor size (â‰¥ 45 mm)as a PTS of 2 (both abnormalities), 1 (one abnormality), or 0 (neitherabnormality). PTS correlated significantly with lymph node metastasis,lymphovascular invasion, and stage (P < 0.0001 each). Survival differences among groups based on PTS were significant (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysisidentified PTS alone as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.0363). PTSderived from primary tumor information alone is a potentially useful marker forpredicting tumor progression and prognosis in postoperative patients with gastriccancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23953 PMCID: PMC5823562PMID: 29492212
