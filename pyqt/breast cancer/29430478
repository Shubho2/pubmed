However, incorporation of volumetric andtemporal components into DCE-MRIs has not been well studied. We propose maximumintensity projection (MIP) images of subtraction MRI as a way to simultaneouslyinclude four-dimensional (4-D) images into lesion classification usingconvolutional neural networks (CNN). The study was performed on a dataset of 690 cases. Regions of interest were selected around each lesion on three MRIpresentations: (i) the MIP image generated on the second postcontrast subtractionMRI, (ii) the central slice of the second postcontrast MRI, and (iii) the centralslice of the second postcontrast subtraction MRI. CNN features were extractedfrom the ROIs using pretrained VGGNet. The features were utilized in the trainingof three support vector machine classifiers to characterize lesions as malignant or benign. Classifier performances were evaluated with fivefold cross-validation and compared based on area under the ROC curve (AUC). The approach using MIPs[Formula: see text] outperformed that using central-slices of either secondpostcontrast MRIs [Formula: see text] or second postcontrast subtraction MRIs[Formula: see text], at statistically significant levels.DOI: 10.1117/1.JMI.5.1.014503 PMCID: PMC5798576 [Available on 2019-02-05]PMID: 29430478
