[Epub ahead of print]The Enhanced Cytotoxic Effects of the p28-Apoptin Chimeric Protein As A NovelAnti-Cancer Agent on Breast Cancer Cell Lines.Noei A(1), Nili-Ahmadabadi A(2), Soleimani M(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School ofPharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.(2)Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, HamadanUniversity of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.BACKGROUNDS: Peptide-based drugs have shown promising results in overcoming thelimitations of chemotherapeutic drugs by providing a targeted therapy approach tocancer. However, the response rate of targeted therapies is limited, in largepart due to the intra- and inter-heterogeneity of tumors.METHODS: In this study, we engineered a novel chimeric protein composed of thep28 peptide as a tumor-homing killer peptide and apoptin as a killer peptide. We evaluated its cytotoxicity against MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells andHEK-293 normal cells by the MTT assay. Different linkers were evaluated whendesigning the chimeric protein. Three-dimensional structure predictions ofchimeric proteins with different linkers were carried out by Modeller 9.19, andtheir validation and analysis were performed by RAMPAGE.RESULTS: Results showed that a cleavable linker, including furin cleavage sites, is preferred over other linkers. The chimeric protein was then successfullyexpressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography under nativeconditions, then confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Compared withapoptin alone, the chimeric protein showed significantly higher toxicity against breast cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 values of thechimeric protein for MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were 38.55 µg/mL and 43.11 µg/mL, respectively. There was no significant cytotoxic effect on the normal HEK293 cellline.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that fusion of p28 peptide to a potentprotein could provide an effective method for tumor targeting. Further, in vitro and in vivo studies of this novel chimeric protein are underway.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.DOI: 10.1055/a-0654-4952 PMID: 30060264
