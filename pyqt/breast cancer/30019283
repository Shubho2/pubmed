The aim of this prospectiverandomized study is to show its place in excisional breast biopsy.METHODS: An oncoplastic approach excision was compared with conventionalexcisional breast biopsies. The study included 80 patients, of whom half receivedoncoplastic intervention and half received the conventional. The primary endpointwas the cosmetic result. Patient, surgeon and independent observers rated theresults on a four-point scale. Scores other than self-perceived were based onthird-month medical photographs.RESULTS: Between May 20, 2015 and April 27, 2016, 40 patients were randomlyassigned to oncoplastic biopsy and 40 patients were assigned to conventionalexcisional biopsy. Median follow-up was 5.6 months (IQR 3.0-6.0). Self-perceived perfect scoring for general cosmetic outcome was found significantly higher afteroncoplastic biopsy (73 0.5%) comparing with control group (32.4%) (p = 0.001).This impact did not change after adjusting patients for potential confounders.Margin clearance rates in malignant cases were comparable in both arms(p = 0.999); four patients in oncoplastic biopsy group (40%) and three patientsin control group (33%) had positive margins.CONCLUSIONS: The oncoplastic biopsy achieved better cosmetic results with similarsurgical margin positivity rates when compared with conventional breast biopsy.It may be a better biopsy option used for patients requiring excisional breastbiopsy.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0892-2 PMID: 30019283
