The objective of this study was to describe contemporary treatmentpatterns among postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC in the real-world setting.METHODS: Data were collected from 64 community oncologists in the US betweenFebruary and June 2017 using an online medical records extraction tool.Physicians reviewed medical records and provided information on patientdemographics and disease characteristics, and treatment regimens. Treatmentpatterns were described overall and separately by line of therapy and type oftreatment received. Discontinuation rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meieranalyses to account for censoring.RESULTS: Data were collected on 401 patients. Mean age at the time of mBCdiagnosis was 67 years. In the first-line setting, 52.4% of patients received acyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor-based regimen, most commonly with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) (39.2%) or fulvestrant (10.0%); 30.2% receivedendocrine therapy, most commonly an AI (21.4%) or fulvestrant (5.2%) inmonotherapy, while 12.7% received a chemotherapy-based regimen. In thesecond-line setting, 42.9% of patients received a CDK4/6 inhibitor-based regimen,18.4% received endocrine therapy, and 22.4% received a chemotherapy-basedregimen. The 18-month discontinuation rate was 34.5% for patients receiving aCDK4/6 inhibitor-based regimen and 45.8% for patients receiving endocrinemonotherapy.CONCLUSION: CDK4/6 inhibitor-based regimens were the most commonly prescribedtreatment in both first- and second-line settings. A wide variety of treatmentsequences were observed which suggests an absence of a standard of care forpostmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC in real-world practice.DOI: 10.1007/s12325-018-0676-2 PMID: 29582246
