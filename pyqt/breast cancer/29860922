Patients and Methods Patientswere randomly assigned at a two-to-one ratio to ribociclib plus fulvestrant orplacebo plus fulvestrant. The primary end point was locally assessedprogression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival,overall response rate, and safety. Results A total of 484 postmenopausal womenwere randomly assigned to ribociclib plus fulvestrant, and 242 were assigned toplacebo plus fulvestrant. Median progression-free survival was significantlyimproved with ribociclib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant: 20.5months (95% CI, 18.5 to 23.5 months) versus 12.8 months (95% CI, 10.9 to 16.3months), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.593; 95% CI, 0.480 to 0.732; P < .001).Consistent treatment effects were observed in patients who were treatment naïvein the advanced setting (hazard ratio, 0.577; 95% CI, 0.415 to 0.802), as well asin patients who had received up to one line of prior endocrine therapy foradvanced disease (hazard ratio, 0.565; 95% CI, 0.428 to 0.744). Among patientswith measurable disease, the overall response rate was 40.9% for the ribociclibplus fulvestrant arm and 28.7% for placebo plus fulvestrant. Grade 3 adverseevents reported in ≥ 10% of patients in either arm (ribociclib plus fulvestrant vplacebo plus fulvestrant) were neutropenia (46.6% v 0%) and leukopenia (13.5% v0%); the only grade 4 event reported in ≥ 5% of patients was neutropenia (6.8% v 0%). Conclusion Ribociclib plus fulvestrant might represent a new first- orsecond-line treatment option in hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2018.78.9909 PMID: 29860922
