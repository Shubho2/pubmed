Speculatively, ectopic expression of placental gene programs mightalso be related to cancer cells' ability to escape from immune vigilancemechanisms during carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Recently, we publishedthe first human genomic evidence of similar immune related gene expressionprofiles in both placenta (placenta and decidual tissue) and cancer (both primaryand metastatic) in the same patient with lymph-node positive breast carcinomaduring pregnancy. Here we report the first epigenomic analysis of these tissuesamples and describe their main findings, with respect to immune related genesregulation (over or under expressed) in cancer cells with regards placentaltissues. We confirm significant similarities, and hierarchical clustering (bothunsupervised and supervised), in CpG island methylation patterns betweendecidual/placental and cancer microenvironments, which cannot be easily explainedby simple models or unique pathways. Several different cell types are probablyinvolved in these complex immune regulation mechanisms. Cancers may somehow"hijack" gene programs evolved over millions of years to allow for feto-maternal tolerance in placental mammals in order to escape from immune vigilance andspread locally or to distant sites.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23488 PMCID: PMC5814192PMID: 29464052
