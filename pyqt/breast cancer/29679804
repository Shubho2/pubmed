Electronic address: emvalle@usal.es.Polydopamine (PD) is a synthetic melanin pigment of great importance inbiomedicine, where its affinity for metallic cations, especially paramagneticions, has sparked interest in its use in the development of magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) contrast agents. In this work, we report the cytotoxicity ofmetal-enriched PD nanoparticles on NIH3T3, a healthy cell line and BT474, abreast cancer cell line. Remarkably, it was found that the metal- enriched PDparticles (Mn+ = Fe3+, Fe2+ and Cu2+) were highly cytotoxic to the breast cancer cells, even after 24 h of treatment. Although, this effect was not selectivesystems, since an acute cytotoxic effect was also observed on the healthy cellline, this system can be considered as starting point for designing advancedantineoplastic agents.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
