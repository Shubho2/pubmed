However, data from European institutions are limited andrevealed conflicting results. We report on 15-year trends of mastectomy,mastectomy plus immediate reconstruction and contralateral prophylacticmastectomy (CPM) at an academic institution.METHODS: We identified women diagnosed with unilateral early breast cancer atstage 0-IIa, with tumour size ≤ 4 cm, between 2002 and 2016. Trends were assessedusing the Cochrane-Armitage test. Multivariable logistic regression was used toidentify factors associated with receipt of mastectomy plus immediatereconstruction.RESULTS: A total of 2315 patients were identified. Of them, 65.7% underwentbreast conserving surgery (BCS), while 34.3% underwent mastectomy as upfrontsurgery. Two point four per cent also received CPM. Immediate reconstruction was performed in 36.0% of patients receiving mastectomy. There was no change intrends of mastectomy over the 15 years studied (p = 0.69), as well as in trendsof patients undergoing CPM (p = 0.44). In contrast, rates of immediatereconstruction rose significantly over the study period (from 12.2% in 2002 to62.7% in 2016, p < 0.0001). Women were more likely to receive mastectomy plusimmediate reconstruction if they were aged 50 years or younger, or had tumourslarger than 2 cm, or had non-invasive carcinoma.CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that rates of both mastectomy and CPM in earlybreast cancer are not increasing, while use of immediate reconstruction is on therise.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
