Narrative reports have been shown to be incomplete. Synopticreports utilize standardized templates to record data and have emerged as analternative to narrative reports. This study evaluates the uptake and impact ofsynoptic reporting for breast cancer surgery in a community care setting.METHODS: A retrospective review of operative reports documenting breast cancersurgeries over a consecutive 3-year period.RESULTS: 772 narrative reports and 158 synoptic reports were reviewed. Synopticreports were associated with a higher degree of overall completeness (60% vs 45%)when compared to narrative reports. 6 out of 7 surgeons that produced at least 5 synoptic and 5 narrative reports had increases in completeness with use ofsynoptic reporting.CONCLUSIONS: Use of synoptic reporting improves breast cancer operative reportcompleteness and decreases superfluous content when compared to narrativereports. While synoptic report uptake during the study period was suboptimalthere exists several means by which it can be improved, including investment ininformation technology infrastructure and emphasis on stakeholder engagement.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
