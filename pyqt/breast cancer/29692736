Studies have shown that lncRNAs are involved in multiplecellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. In this report, a long non-coding RNA-ATB that is overexpressed in various tumor tissues and cell lines was investigated. Recent evidence suggests that ATB isdysfunctional in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma,gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC), breast cancer (BC), prostatecancer, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreaticcancer, osteosarcoma, and glioma. The high expression of ATB is associated withclinicopathological features of cancer patients. In addition, overexpression oflncRNA-ATB can promote tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. LncRNA-ATBinduces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by competitively binding tomiRNAs, thus promoting tumor progression. Biological functions and mechanisms of ATB in human cancers are discussed here, concluding that lncRNA-ATB may provide anew biomarker for use in diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2018.00321 PMCID: PMC5902489PMID: 29692736
