India.The signalling function of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in endocannabinoidsystem is delineated by Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). MAGL readdresses thelipid stores in the direction of pro-tumorigenic signalling lipids in cancercells. Selective as well as potent MAGL inhibitors are limited in number hencetheir continuous development may lead to a breakthrough invention in the field ofMAGL inhibitors. In succession of the above, we have synthesised2-amino-4-methylthiazole-5-carboxylate derivatives and characterized them bycollective use of IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, Mass spectral data and elemental analysis.Thirteen compounds (3c-g, 4c, 4e, 4f and 6b-f) inhibited MAGL with IC50 value0.037-9.60 µM. Two compounds (3g and 4c) were found most potent with IC50 value0.037 and 0.063µM respectively. Thirty synthesised compounds were sent to NCI foranticancer screening, out of which nine compounds were selected for one doseanticancer assay. Compounds 3g(NSC:788170) and 4c(NSC:788176)were found to bemost potent during one dose anticancer screening and fulfilled the specifiedthreshold for growth inhibition criteria of NCI and were further selected forfull panel five dose assay at 10-fold dilutions of five different concentrations.The compound 3g displayed GI50 value 0.865 µM against EKVX (Non-Small Cell LungCancer cell line), and 1.20 µM against MDA-MB-468(Breast Cancer cell Line), while(4c) showed GI50 value 0.34 and 0.96 µM against HOP-92 and EKVX (Non-Small CellLung Cancer cell line) and 1.08 µM against MDA-MB-231/ATCC (Breast Cancer cellLine). In addition, molecular docking studies of the said MAGL inhibitors havealso been presented in this article.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1389557518666180702103542 PMID: 29962341
