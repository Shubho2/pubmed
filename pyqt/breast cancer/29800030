[Epub ahead ofprint]Use and Effectiveness of Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for Hormone Receptor-PositiveBreast Cancer in Men.Venigalla S(1), Carmona R(1)(2), Guttmann DM(1), Jain V(1), Freedman GM(1), ClarkAS(3), Shabason JE(1).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University ofPennsylvania, Philadelphia.(2)Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia.(3)Department of Medical Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University ofPennsylvania, Philadelphia.Importance: Although adjuvant endocrine therapy confers a survival benefit among females with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer, the effectiveness ofthis treatment among males with HR-positive breast cancer has not been rigorouslyinvestigated.Objective: To investigate trends, patterns of use, and effectiveness of adjuvant endocrine therapy among men with HR-positive breast cancer.Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study identifiedpatients in the National Cancer Database with breast cancer who had receivedtreatment from 2004 through 2014. Inclusion criteria for the primary study cohortwere males at least 18 years old with nonmetastatic HR-positive invasive breastcancer who underwent surgery with or without adjuvant endocrine therapy. A cohortof female patients was also identified using the same inclusion criteria forcomparative analyses by sex. Data analysis was conducted from October 1, 2017, toDecember 15, 2017.Exposures: Receipt of adjuvant endocrine therapy.Main Outcomes and Measures: Patterns of adjuvant endocrine therapy use wereassessed using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Association betweenadjuvant endocrine therapy use and overall survival was assessed using propensityscore-weighted multivariable Cox regression models.Results: The primary study cohort comprised 10 173 men with HR-positive breastcancer (mean [interquartile range] age, 66 [57-75] years). The comparative cohortcomprised 961 676 women with HR-positive breast cancer (mean [interquartilerange] age, 62 [52-72] years). The median follow-up for the male cohort was 49.6 months (range, 0.1-142.5 months). Men presented more frequently than women withHR-positive disease (94.0% vs 84.3%, P < .001). However, eligible men were lesslikely than women to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy (67.3% vs 79.0%; OR,0.61; 95% CI, 0.58-0.63; P < .001). Treatment at academic facilities (odds ratio,1.13; 95% CI, 1.02-1.25; P = .02) and receipt of adjuvant radiotherapy (oddsratio, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.55-3.15; P < .001) or chemotherapy (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.07-1.34; P < .001) were statistically significantly associated withadjuvant endocrine therapy use in men. A propensity score-weighted analysisindicated that relative to no use, adjuvant endocrine therapy use in men wasassociated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.63-0.77;P < .001).Conclusions and Relevance: There is a sex disparate underuse of adjuvantendocrine therapy among men with HR-positive breast cancer despite the use ofthis treatment being associated with improved overall survival. Further research and interventions may be warranted to bridge gaps in care in this population.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1114 PMID: 29800030
