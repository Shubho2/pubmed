Patients were randomized 1:1 byminimization to orally receive either anastrozole (1 mg once daily) plus UFT(tegafur/uracil combination in 1:4 molar ratio; 270 mg/m2/day in two divideddoses) or anastrozole (as above) alone for 24 weeks. Tumor response was assessed by investigator and central review as per RECIST v1.1. The primary endpoint wasthe proportion of patients with best overall response of CR or PR [clinicalresponse rate (RR)] determined by central radiologic review.RESULTS: The study was prematurely terminated due to Grade ≥ 3 liver dysfunction reported in 3 patients receiving anastrozole/UFT. Of 57 patients randomizedbefore termination (29 anastrozole/UFT, 28 anastrozole), all were analyzed forsafety and 56 (28 each group) for tumor response. Compared with anastrozolealone, anastrozole/UFT did not achieve significantly higher RR [39.3% (90% CI23.8-56.5%) vs 14.3% (90% CI 5.0-29.8%); p = 0.0683, Fisher's exact test], butproduced significantly greater tumor shrinkage (mean tumor reduction rate 31.0vs. 14.2%; p = 0.0181, unpaired t-test). Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were morecommon with anastrozole/UFT than with anastrozole (17.2 vs. 0%).CONCLUSION: Although the study was terminated owing to the altered liverfunction, it showed that there was a trend to greater shrinkage of tumor in thecombination group for ER-positive, HER2-negative postmenopausal breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3544-5 PMCID: PMC5854715PMID: 29468454
