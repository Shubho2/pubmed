32. Am Surg. 2018 Jun 1;84(6):881-888.Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Comparison of Race and Survival.Doepker MP, Holt SD, Durkin MW, Chu CH, Nottingham JM.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancerwith a high prevalence in blacks. South Carolina demographically has a highpercentage of blacks. This study examines survival and recurrence associated withTNBC in black and white women. A retrospective review of breast cancer patientswithin the Palmetto Health Cancer Registry was performed from 1999 to 2015.Patient demographics and tumor characteristics were collected and correlated withoutcomes. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), andrecurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed. The total number of breast cancerpatients in the registry was 1723 (1085-white and 638-black). The medianfollow-up was 48.4 months. The majority of cancers diagnosed in both cohorts wereearly stage (I, IIA, IIB, 93.4% vs 90.4% P = NS). We identified 332 patients withTNBC. Of those 332 patients, 144 (43.4%) were whites and 188 (56.6%) were blacks.Older age (P = 0.01), high-grade (P < 0.001), and black race (P < 0.001) weresignificantly associated with TNBC on multivariate analysis. Five- and 10-year OSwas significantly worse in blacks with TNBC (P < 0.001). There was no difference in DSS or RFS between the two cohorts. TNBC disproportionately affects blackwomen and is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with limited treatmentoptions compared with receptor-positive breast cancer. Black patients with TNBCin our study had statistically worse OS. These findings are similar to what hasbeen reported in the literature and prompts further research in newer targetedtherapies.PMID: 29981619  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
