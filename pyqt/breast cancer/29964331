[Epub ahead of print]Inhibition of euchromatin histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2 sensitizes breast cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand throughreactive oxygen species-mediated activating transcription factor 4-C/EBPhomologous protein-death receptor 5 pathway activation.Kim SY(1), Hong M(1), Heo SH(2), Park S(1), Kwon TK(3), Sung YH(1)(4), Oh Y(5),Lee S(5), Yi GS(6), Kim I(1)(4).Author information: (1)ASAN Institute for Life Sciences, ASAN Medical Center, Seoul, Republic ofKorea.(2)Department of Convergence Medicine, ASAN Institute for Life Sciences, ASANMedical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.(3)Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu,Republic of Korea.(4)Department of Convergence Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine,Seoul, Republic of Korea.(5)Russell H.

However, breast cancer cells are generallyresistant to TRAIL, thus limiting its therapeutic potential. In this study, wefound that BIX-01294, a selective inhibitor of euchromatin histonemethyltransferase 2/G9a, is a strong TRAIL sensitizer in breast cancer cells. Thecombination of BIX-01294 and TRAIL decreased cell viability and led to anincrease in the annexin V/propidium iodide-positive cell population, DNAfragmentation, and caspase activation. BIX-01294 markedly increased deathreceptor 5 (DR5) expression, while silencing of DR5 using small interfering RNAs abolished the TRAIL-sensitizing effect of BIX-01294. Specifically, BIX-01294induced C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)-mediated DR5 gene transcriptionalactivation and DR5 promoter activation was induced by upregulation of the proteinkinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase-mediated activating transcriptionfactor 4 (ATF4). Moreover, inhibition of reactive oxygen species byN-acetyl-L-cysteine efficiently blocked BIX-01294-induced DR5 upregulation byinhibiting ATF4/CHOP expression, leading to diminished sensitization to TRAIL.These findings suggest that BIX-01294 sensitizes breast cancer cells to TRAIL by upregulating ATF4/CHOP-dependent DR5 expression with a reactive oxygenspecies-dependent manner. Furthermore, combination treatment with BIX-01294 andTRAIL suppressed tumor growth and induced apoptosis in vivo. In conclusion, wefound that epigenetic regulation can contribute to the development of resistance to cancer therapeutics such as TRAIL, and further studies of unfolded proteinresponses and the associated epigenetic regulatory mechanisms may lead to thediscovery of new molecular targets for effective cancer therapy.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/mc.22872 PMID: 29964331
