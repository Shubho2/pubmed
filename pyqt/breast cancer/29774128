With the recent publication of pivotal trials leading to the approval of these compounds in differentindications, their toxicity profile warrants an update.Materials and Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in July 2017.Studies evaluating US FDA approved doses of one of the following ALK inhibitors: Crizotinib, Ceritinib, Alectinib or Brigatinib as monotherapy were included. Datawere analyzed using random effects meta-analysis for absolute risks (AR), studyheterogeneity, publication bias and differences among treatments.Results: Fifteen trials with a total of 2,005 patients with evaluable toxicitydata were included in this report. There was significant heterogeneity amongstdifferent studies. The pooled AR of death and severe adverse events were 0.5% and34.5%, respectively. Grade 3/4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation were uncommon: 2.6%, 2.5%, 2.7%, 1.2%, respectively.Conclusions: ALK inhibitors have an acceptable safety profile with a low risk of treatment-related deaths. Important differences in toxicity profile were detectedamongst the different drugs.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25154 PMCID: PMC5955140PMID: 29774128
