The pooled diagnosticsensitivity, specificity, and the symmetric receiver operating characteristic(SROC) curve was calculated by combining the individual data extracted from 26included studies.RESULTS: The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of MRI to detectaxillary lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer were 0.77 (95%confidence interval [CI] 0.75-0.80) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.89-0.91), respectively.The pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios were 7.67 (95% CI 5.09-11.53) and 0.23 (95% CI 0.17-0.32), respectively, by random effect method. The areaunder the SROC curve was 0.93 for MRI to detect axillary lymph node metastasis inbreast cancer patients.CONCLUSION: With high sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve, MRI is an effective method to differentiate metastatic axillary lymph node in breastcancer patients, which can provide useful information for surgical procedureselection.Â© 2018 The Authors.
