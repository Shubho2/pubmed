The present study aimed to investigatethe effects of miR-29a on the expression of genes involved in apoptosis,including p21, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), p53 and survivin. The MCF-7 breastcancer cell line was transfected with anti-miR-29a and treated with Taxol insubdivided treatment groups including: Scramble; anti-miR-29a; anti-miR-29a +Taxol; Taxol; and control. Expression levels of p21, BCL-2, p53 and survivin wereevaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.miR-29a knockdown resulted in p21 and p53 upregulation and a decrease in survivinexpression. These results indicated that miR-29a inhibition regulates apoptosis. The present data suggested that miR-29a inhibition may be a promising strategyfor the induction of apoptosis of tumor cells.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2017.1528 PMCID: PMC5776418PMID: 29435304
