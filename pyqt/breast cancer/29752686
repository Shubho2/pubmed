Eribulin was approved for the treatment of metastatic breastcancer through the EMBRACE trial, and a subgroup analysis in this clinical trial indicated the efficacy of eribulin in patients with TNBC. However, the prognosis of patients with TNBC is still poor due to various molecular characteristics.Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more effective treatment for themanagement of TNBC.METHODS: We investigated the synergistic effect of a novel histone deacetylase(HDAC) inhibitor, OBP-801, and eribulin in TNBC cell lines because OBP-801 hasbeen known to enhance the anti-tumor activities of other chemotherapeutic agents.The cell growth was analyzed, and the flow cytometry analysis was conducted toevaluate the effects on cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis. The mechanism underlying the enhancement of inhibition of TNBC cell growth was investigatedthrough Western blot analyses.RESULTS: The combination treatment of OBP-801 with eribulin showed thesynergistic inhibition of the growth in TNBC cells, involved with the enhancementof apoptosis. We, for the first time, found that eribulin upregulated survivinand also that OBP-801 could remarkably suppress the upregulation of survivin byeribulin. Moreover, this combination potently suppressed Bcl-xL and the MAPKpathway compared with either agent alone.CONCLUSION: We found that the combination of OBP-801 and eribulin synergisticallyinhibited theÂ growth with apoptosis in TNBC cells, suggesting that thiscombination might be a promising novel strategy for treating TNBC patients.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4815-x PMID: 29752686
