The main objective of this protocol was to define a minimum set ofeasily implemented quality control tests on digital mammography systems that can be used to assure the performance of a system within a set and acceptable range. Detailed step-by-step instructions have been provided, limiting as much aspossible any misinterpretations or variations by the person performing. It isintended that these tests be implemented as part of the daily routine of medical physicists and system users throughout Europe in a harmonised way so allowingresults to be compared. In this paper the main characteristics of the protocolare illustrated, including examples, together with a brief summary of thecontents of each chapter. Finally, instructions for the download of the fullprotocol and of the related software tools are provided.Copyright © 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica. Published by ElsevierLtd.
