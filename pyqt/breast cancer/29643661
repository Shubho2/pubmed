Recognition of metastatic tumors in the breast isimportant because it would prevent unnecessary mutilating surgery and would lead to appropriate treatment of the primary tumor. Breast metastases from medullarythyroid cancer (MTC) are very rare with only 21 reported cases in the literature.Some MTCs mimic primary invasive lobular carcinoma of the breasthistopathologically and radiologically, making the distinction between the twodiagnostically challenging. We present the case of a 45-year-old femalepresenting with a lump breast, which was later found out to be metastasis frommedullary carcinoma thyroid.DOI: 10.4103/0970-9371.228217 PMCID: PMC5885600PMID: 29643661
