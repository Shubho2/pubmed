[Epub ahead ofprint]A role for FGF2 in visceral adiposity-associated mammary epithelialtransformation.Benham V(1), Chakraborty D(1), Bullard B(1), Bernard JJ(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology , Michigan State University , EastLansing , MI , United States.Obesity is a leading risk factor for post-menopausal breast cancer, and this isconcerning as 40% of cancer diagnoses in 2014 were associated withoverweight/obesity. Despite this epidemiological link, the underlying mechanismresponsible is unknown. We recently published that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) releases FGF2 and stimulates the transformation of skin epithelial cells.Furthermore, obesity is differentially associated with many epithelial cancers,and this mechanistic link could be translational. As FGF2 and FGFR1 areimplicated in breast cancer progression, we hypothesize that VAT-derived FGF2plays a translational role in promoting adiposity-associated mammary epithelialcell transformation. In this brief report, data suggest that FGF2/FGFR1 signalingis a potential mechanistic link in VAT-stimulated transformation of breastepithelial cells.DOI: 10.1080/21623945.2018.1445889 PMID: 29561195
