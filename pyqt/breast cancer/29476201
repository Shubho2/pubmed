Recently,BCSCs are implicated to be a cause of metastasis, tumor relapse, and therapyresistance in breast cancer. BCSCs have unique molecular mechanisms, which can betargeted to eliminate them. These include surface biomarkers, proteins involvedin self-renewal pathways, drug efflux transporters, apoptotic/antiapoptoticproteins, autophagy, metabolism, and microenvironment regulation. The complexmolecular mechanisms behind the survival of BCSCs and pharmacological targets forelimination of BCSCs are described in this review.DOI: 10.1007/s00210-018-1479-3 PMID: 29476201
