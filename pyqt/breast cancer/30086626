[Epub ahead of print]Identification of an orally bioavailable chromene-based Selective EstrogenReceptor Degrader (SERD) that demonstrates robust activity in a model oftamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.Nagasawa J, Govek S, Kahraman M, Lai A, Bonnefous C, Douglas K, Sensintaffar J,Lu N, Lee K, Aparicio A, Kaufman J, Qian J, Shao G, Prudente R, Joseph JD,Darimond B, Brigham D, Maheu K, Heyman R, Rix P, Hager JH, Smith ND.Approximately eighty percent of breast cancers are estrogen receptor alpha (ER-)positive, and although women typically initially respond well to anti-hormonaltherapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, resistance often emerges.Fulvestrant is a steroid-based, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that both antagonizes and degrades ER-, and is active in patients who have progressedon anti-hormonal agents. However fulvestrant suffers from poor pharmaceuticalproperties and must be administered by intra-muscular injections that limit thetotal amount of drug that can be administered, and hence lead to the potentialfor incomplete receptor blockade. We describe the optimization of ER-degradation efficacy of a chromene series of ER modulators resulting in highlypotent and efficacious SERDs. It was found that the side-chain ring size andstereochemical elements were central in driving degradation efficacy, leading to the identification of 14n. When examined in a xenograft model oftamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, biphenol chromene 14n (ER-degradationefficacy = 91%) demonstrated robust activity, while despite superior oralexposure, a mono-phenol chromene 15g (ER- degradation efficacy = 82%) wasessentially inactive. Although not definitively causative, this result suggeststhat optimizing ER- degradation efficacy leads to compounds with robust effects models of tamoxifen-resistance.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00921 PMID: 30086626
