This report highlights gastrointestinal perforation caused bybevacizumab for breast cancer, which is of special interest becausegastrointestinal perforations caused by bevacizumab are very rare in breastcancer.CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of 54-year-old Japanese woman. She wasdiagnosed as having inoperable breast cancer T2 N1 M1 (pleura, peritoneum), StageIV, and received chemotherapy by paclitaxel. There was reduction in the primarytumor and disappearance of the pleural effusion; however, the ascites did notchange. We performed diagnostic laparoscopy which revealed that her wholeperitoneum was thickened, and her small intestine, colon, and her omentum weregrouped and formed an omental cake. We submitted a part of her peritoneum topathological examination and diagnosed the peritoneum dissemination of breastcancer. On the basis of these results, paclitaxel and bevacizumab combinationchemotherapy was started, and a decrease in ascites was seen. However, agastrointestinal perforation occurred on 26th day of second cycle of bevacizumab + paclitaxel, and we performed an emergency operation. In the operation, theomental cake was resolved, and we could search the full length of thegastrointestinal tract. Two small perforations of her small intestine were seen. We performed simple closures for perforations, and peritoneal lavage anddrainage. She was in a state of septic shock, but it improved. It was thoughtthat the small intestinal perforations were caused by the bevacizumab-additional chemotherapy which was very effective.CONCLUSIONS: We report a very rare and valuable case. This case suggests that therisk of gastrointestinal perforation must be considered in a case of bevacizumab administration, and it is necessary to determine carefully the patientadministered bevacizumab, regardless of the type of cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13256-018-1619-x PMCID: PMC5870367PMID: 29580267
