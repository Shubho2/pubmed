Although it is appreciatedthat physiological, pathological, and therapeutic conditions impacthematopoiesis, it remains unclear if targeting hematopoiesis presentsopportunities for limiting bone metastasis. Using pre-clinical breast cancermodels, we discovered that marrow from mice treated with the bisphosphonatezoledronic acid (ZA) are metastasis-suppressive. Specifically, ZA modulatedhematopoietic myeloid/osteoclast progenitor cell (M/OCP) lineage potential toactivate metastasis-suppressive activity. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor(G-CSF) promoted ZA resistance by redirecting M/OCP differentiation. Weidentified M/OCP and bone marrow transcriptional programs associated withmetastasis suppression and ZA resistance. Analysis of patient blood samples takenat random revealed that women with high plasma G-CSF experienced significantlyworse outcome with adjuvant ZA than those with lower G-CSF levels. Our findingssupport discovery of therapeutic strategies to direct M/OCP lineage potential andbiomarkers that stratify responses in patients at risk of recurrence.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-0548 PMID: 30065048
