The effects of MASTL depletion with siRNAs wereevaluated in various breast cancer cells or normal cells. Various methods,including cell viability, cell cycle, soft agar, immunoblotting,immunofluorescence, PP2A activity, live image, and sphere forming assay, wereused in this study.RESULTS: This study showed the oncosuppressive mechanism of MASTL targeting that promotes mitotic catastrophe through PP2A activation selectively in breast cancercells. MASTL expression was closely associated with tumor progression and poorprognosis in breast cancer. The depletion of MASTL reduced the oncogenicproperties of breast cancer cells with high MASTL expression, but did not affect the viability of non-transformed normal cells with low MASTL expression. Withregard to the underlying mechanism, we found that MASTL inhibition caused mitoticcatastrophe through PP2A activation in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, MASTLdepletion enhanced the radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells with increasedPP2A activity. Notably, MASTL depletion dramatically reduced the formation ofradioresistant breast cancer stem cells in response to irradiation.CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that MASTL inhibition promoted mitotic catastrophethrough PP2A activation, which led to the inhibition of cancer cell growth and a reversal of radioresistance in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4600-6 PMCID: PMC6034325PMID: 29976159
