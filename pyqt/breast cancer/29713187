In cancer metastasis, tumor cells must detach from the primary tumor,invade surrounding tissue, and enter and survive in a foreign microenvironment.The metastatic potential of breast cancer is closely related to individualpatient genetic profile. Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanism thatregulates the Hippo pathway in breast cancer metastasis is yet to be fullyelucidated. This article discusses the function and regulation of the Hippopathway, with focus given to its role in the context of breast cancer metastasis.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S157058 PMCID: PMC5909795PMID: 29713187
