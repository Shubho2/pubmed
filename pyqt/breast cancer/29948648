Considering the complexity of IncRNAsregulatory network, the identification of novel and functional lncRNAs associatedwith breast cancer is thus very important. By using Agilent LncRNA Human GeneExpression Microarray, we identified a number of lncRNAs that were differentiallyexpressed in breast cancer compared to their corresponding adjacent tissues.According to the microarray, the expression of p10247, henceforth named aslncRNA-BCHE (standing for lncRNA high expressed in breast cancer), was found tobe uniformly higher in all the five breast cancer tissues tested, and this wasfurther confirmed in 56 breast cancer tissues by real-time RT-PCR. The functionof lncRNA-BCHE in breast cancer cells was tested by knockdown and over-expressionexperiments in vitro. We also analyzed the public cohorts of breast cancerpatients on the Kaplan Meier plotter platform. Clinical analysis revealed thatthe expression of lncRNA-BCHE was significantly correlated with advanced clinicalstage and lymph node metastasis. Our data indicate that lncRNA-BCHE regulates thegrowth, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. In addition, we found thatthese functions are mediated, at least in part, by the regulation of integrinsubunit beta 1 (ITGB1) levels. The expression of ITGB1 serves as a negativeprognostic factor and metastasis risk predictor in breast cancer, irrespective ofsubtype and therapeutic regimen. In summary, our results suggest that lncRNA-BCHEis an oncogenic lncRNA enhancing the growth and metastatic potential of breastcancer cells, and a potential predictor of breast cancer metastatic progression.DOI: 10.1007/s10585-018-9901-2 PMID: 29948648
