Due to its rarity, data on appropriate axillary management islacking, prompting this investigation of LN status and outcomes.Methods: We identified 41 MBC patients treated at our institution 2001-2011 whowere followed for a median of 66 months. Statistical analyses evaluated axillary ultrasound (AUS), fine needle aspiration (FNA), and sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) in association with LN status.Results: Median tumor size was 2.7 cm and 76% were triple-negative. Twenty-three patients (56%) had preoperative AUS: 9 (39%) showed ≥1 suspicious LN, 6 proceededto LN FNA and 3 were confirmed positive. Six patients had neoadjuvantchemotherapy, including 2 FNA LN+. Ten patients were LN+ at operation. Among 19patients undergoing AUS and axillary surgery, AUS ± FNA sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 94%. LN positivity correlated with increasing tumor size, gradeand angiolymphatic invasion. 16 patients recurred, 63% with distant disease(10/16) and one with isolated axillary disease after a negative SLNB not precededby AUS. Overall SLNB accuracy was 96% (23/24), but absent preoperative AUS, 1/7(14%) of SLNBs were falsely negative.Conclusions: Our study is the first to specifically address the performance andutility of AUS/FNA and SLNB for MBC patients. AUS/FNA at diagnosis followed bySLN surgery provided accurate nodal staging and critical prognostic informationto inform treatment recommendations. We recommend this approach for axillarymanagement of MBC patients.DOI: 10.21037/gs.2018.01.01 PMCID: PMC5938275PMID: 29770313
