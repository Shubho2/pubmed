Liquid biopsiesprovide noninvasive prognostic markers such as circulating tumor DNA and RNA.Circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA) in blood is also used to identify mutations ingenes of interest, but additionally, provides information about relativeexpression levels of important genes. In this study, we analyzed PD-L1 expressionin ctRNA isolated from various cancer types. Tumors inhibit antitumor response bymodulating the immune checkpoint proteins programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) andits cognate receptor PD1. The expression of these genes has been implicated inevasion of immune response and resistance to targeted therapies.METHODS: Blood samples were collected from gastric (GC), colorectal (CRC), lung(NSCLC), breast (BC), prostate cancer (PC) patients, and a healthy control group.ctRNA was purified from fractionated plasma, and following reverse transcription,levels of PD-L1 expression were analyzed using qPCR.RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was detected in the plasma ctRNA of all cancer types atvarying frequencies but no PD-L1 mRNA was detected in cancer-free individuals.The frequencies of PD-L1 expression were significantly different among thevarious cancer types but the median relative PD-L1 expression values were notsignificantly different. In 12 cases where plasma and tumor tissue were availablefrom the same patients, there was a high degree of concordance between expressionof PD-L1 protein in tumor tissues and PD-L1 gene expression in plasma, and bothmethods were equally predictive of response to nivolumab.CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 mRNA can be detected and quantitated in ctRNA of cancerpatients. These results pave the way for further studies aimed at determiningwhether monitoring the levels of PD-L1 mRNA in blood can identify patients whoare most likely to benefit from the conventional treatment.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
