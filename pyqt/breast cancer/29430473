Epub 2018 Feb 1.Dose and diagnostic performance comparison between phase-contrast mammographywith synchrotron radiation and digital mammography: a clinical study report.Fedon C(1)(2), Rigon L(1)(3), Arfelli F(1)(3), Dreossi D(4), Quai E(3), TonuttiM(5), Tromba G(4), Cova MA(5)(6), Longo R(1)(3).Author information: (1)Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Trieste, Trieste, Italy.(2)Radboud University Medical Centre, Department of Radiology and NuclearMedicine, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.(3)University of Trieste, Department of Physics, Trieste, Italy.(4)Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste S.C.p.A., Basovizza, Trieste, Italy.(5)Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata di Trieste, Department of Radiology,Trieste, Italy.(6)University of Trieste, Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences,Trieste, Italy.Two dosimetric quantities [mean glandular dose (MGD) and entrance surface airkerma (ESAK)] and the diagnostic performance of phase-contrast mammography withsynchrotron radiation (MSR) are compared to conventional digital mammography(DM). Seventy-one patients (age range, 41 to 82 years) underwent MSR after a DMexamination if questionable or suspicious breast abnormalities were not clarifiedby ultrasonography. The MGD and the ESAK delivered in both examinations wereevaluated and compared. Two on-site radiologists rated the images in consensusaccording to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment categories, which were then correlated with the final diagnoses by means of statisticalgeneralized linear models (GLMs). Receiver operating characteristic curves werealso used to assess the diagnostic performance by comparing the area under thecurve (AUC). An important MGD and ESAK reduction was observed in MSR due to themonoenergetic beam. In particular, an average 43% reduction was observed for the MGD and a reduction of more than 50% for the ESAK. GLM showed higher diagnosticaccuracy, especially in terms of specificity, for MSR, confirmed by AUC analysis ([Formula: see text]). The study design implied that the population wascharacterized by a high prevalence of disease and that the radiologists, who readthe DM images before referring the patient to MSR, could have been influenced in their assessments. Within these limitations, the use of synchrotron radiationwith the phase-contrast technique applied to mammography showed an important dosereduction and a higher diagnostic accuracy compared with DM. These results could further encourage research on the translation of x-ray phase-contrast imaginginto the clinics.DOI: 10.1117/1.JMI.5.1.013503 PMCID: PMC5793956 [Available on 2019-02-01]PMID: 29430473
