However, some rare malignant breast lesions canalso present a hyperechoic appearance. Most of these hyperechoic malignantlesions present other characteristics that are more typically suggestive ofmalignancy such as posterior shadowing, a more vertical axis or irregular marginsthat help to guide the diagnosis. Post magnetic resonance imaging, second-lookultrasound may visualise hyperechoic malignant lesions that would not have beenidentified at first sight and radiologists must know how to recognise theselesions.TEACHING POINTS: • Some rare malignant breast lesions can present ahyperechoic appearance. • Malignant lesions present other characteristics thatare suggestive of malignancy. • An echogenic mass with fat density on mammographydoes not require biopsy.DOI: 10.1007/s13244-017-0590-1 PMCID: PMC5893486PMID: 29476429
