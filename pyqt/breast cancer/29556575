Randomizedtrials have demonstrated that radiation fibrosis may be preventable with amedication regimen of pentoxifylline and vitamin E. This study investigatespatient compliance with pentoxifylline therapy while examining possiblecorrelations to compliance.Methods and materials: We identified 90 patients who were prescribedpentoxifylline (400 mg 3 times daily) and vitamin E (400 IU once daily) afteradjuvant breast radiation. A retrospective cohort study was conducted usingmedical record analysis. Data were collected, including patient age, comorbidconditions, concurrent medications, duration of pentoxifylline and vitamin Etherapy, dose adjustments, patient-reported side effects, and cause fordiscontinuation. A multivariate analysis of the correlation between medicationcompliance and these categorical variables was assessed with a χ2 analysis ofindependence.Results: Patient compliance with pentoxifylline and vitamin E therapy was foundto be poor in 33 of 87 patients (38%) in the cohort, necessitating either dosereductions or discontinuation of therapy. There was a statistically significantcorrelation between concurrent antiemetic therapy and successful completion ofpentoxifylline regimen. Of those on antiemetic therapy, 89% completedpentoxifylline as prescribed versus 48% of those without antiemetics (P < .001). There was a statistically significant correlation between concurrent proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and discontinuation of pentoxifylline. Of those on PPItherapy, 33% completed pentoxifylline versus 81% of those not on PPIs (P < .001).All other variables examined were not significantly correlated with compliance.Conclusions: Patient compliance with pentoxifylline appears to be worse inclinical practice compared with previously published studies. Nausea was the mostfrequently reported indication for treatment modification or discontinuation.Concurrent antiemetic therapy was correlated with strong regimen compliance, but concurrent PPI therapy was correlated with poor compliance, independent ofcomorbid conditions.DOI: 10.1016/j.adro.2017.09.004 PMCID: PMC5856981PMID: 29556575
