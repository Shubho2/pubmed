Weexplored the regulation of autophagy in breast cancer cells by HER2 in vitro and the effects of genetic and pharmacological strategies to increase autophagy onHER2-driven breast cancer growth in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that HER2interacts with Beclin 1 in breast cancer cells and inhibits autophagy. Mice with increased basal autophagy due to a genetically engineered mutation in Becn1 areprotected from HER2-driven mammary tumorigenesis, and HER2 fails to inhibitautophagy in primary cells derived from these mice. Moreover, treatment of micewith HER2-positive human breast cancer xenografts with the Tat-Beclin 1autophagy-inducing peptide inhibits tumor growth as effectively as a clinicallyused HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). This inhibition of tumor growth isassociated with a robust induction of autophagy, a disruption of HER2/Beclin 1binding, and a transcriptional signature in the tumors distinct from thatobserved with HER2 TKI treatment. Taken together, these findings indicate thatthe HER2-mediated inhibition of Beclin 1 and autophagy likely contributes toHER2-mediated tumorigenesis and that strategies to block HER2/Beclin 1 bindingand/or increase autophagy may represent a new therapeutic approach forHER2-positive breast cancers.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).
