Due to the high cost of the therapy and no refund of the drug in many countries, there is still alarge group of patients who do not have the opportunity to receive trastuzumab. Abiosimilar is a medical product highly similar to another already approvedbiological medicine. Biosimilars are approved according to the same standards of pharmaceutical quality, safety and efficacy that apply to all biologicalmedicines. Clinically effective biosimilars may expand patient access totrastuzumab therapy. In the coming months, European Medicines Agency (EMA)continues to increase the number of biosimilar approvals for trastuzumab, helpingto promote competition that can lower therapy costs.© 2018 MEDPRESS.PMID: 29813044
