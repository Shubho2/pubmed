Electronic address: zengmsh@sysucc.org.cn.The sodium pump Na+/K+ ATPase a1 subunit(NKA a1), an attractive cancer-relatedbiomarker and therapeutic target, is closely related to the development andprogression of several cancers including breast cancer. Currently, a NKA a1inhibitor, UNBS1450, has already evidenced its great therapeutic potential inpersonalized cancer treatment. The ability of non-invasive imaging of NKA a1expression would be useful for selecting cancer patients who may benefit fromthis drug. Here, we identified an S3 peptide that is specifically homed to breastcancer by phage display. All data of in vitro and in vivo experiments suggestedthe excellent targeting character of the S3 peptide. As the binding activity ofthe S3 phage was positively correlated to the level of NKA α1 expression invarious breast cancer cells, NKA α1 was validated as the primary target of the S3peptide. Based on immunohistochemistry staining result of 107 breast cancerpatients, NKA α1 was verified to be a novel tracking marker and a prognosticpredictor for breast cancer. Importantly, we proposed and validated an S3peptide-based radiotracer 18F-ALF-NOTA-S3 for PET (Positron Emission Tomography) imaging of breast cancer and other NKA α1-overexpressing cancers, includinghepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, in mouse models. Ourfindings demonstrated the potential application of 18F-ALF-NOTA-S3 forvisualization of NKA α1-positive lesions, which provide a new approach tocharacter tumor phenotypic imaging.Copyright © 2018.
