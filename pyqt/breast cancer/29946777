Breastcancer is a highly heterogeneous disease rooted in a genetic basis and reflected in clinical behavior. The diversity of breast cancer hormone receptor status and the expression of surface molecules has guided therapy decisions for decades;however, subtype-specific treatment often yields diverse responses due to varyingtumor evolution and malignant potential. Although understanding the mechanismsbehind breast cancer heterogeneity is still a challenge, available evidencesuggests that studying its metabolism has the potential to give valuable insight into the causes of these variations, as well as viable targets for intervention.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-77736-8_6 PMID: 29946777
