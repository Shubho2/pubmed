However, several GPCRs retain anatypical intracellular/nuclear location in various types of cancer. Thepathological significance of this is currently unknown. Here we extend thisobservation by showing that the bradykinin B2R (BK-B2R) is nuclearly expressed inthe human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 and in human clinical specimens of TNBC. We posited that these "nuclearized" receptors couldbe involved in oncogenic signaling linked to aberrant growth and survivalmaintenance of TNBC. We used cell-penetrating BK-B2R antagonists, includingFR173657 and novel transducible, cell-permeable forms of the peptide B2Rantagonist HOE 140 (NG68, NG134) to demonstrate their superior efficacy overimpermeable ones (HOE 140), in blocking proliferation and promoting apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells. Some showed an even greater antineoplastic activity overconventional chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. The cell-permeable B2R antagonists had less to no anticancer effects on B2R shRNA-knockdown or non-B2R expressing(COS-1) cells, indicating specificity in their action. Possible mechanisms oftheir anticancer effects may involve activation of p38kinase/p27Kip1 pathways.Together, our data support the existence of a possible intracrine signalingpathway via internal/nuclear B2R, critical for the growth of TNBC cells, andidentify new chemical entities that enable to target the correspondingintracellular GPCRs.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24009 PMCID: PMC5839409PMID: 29515778
