Pathological completeresponse (pCR) of the primary tumor was evaluated using PERCIST, while effects ofclinicopathological factors on progression-free survival (PFS) were examinedusing log-rank and Cox methods.RESULTS: Fifty-six patients and 54 primary tumors were evaluated. Completemetabolic response (CMR), partial metabolic response, stable metabolic disease,and progressive metabolic disease were seen in 45, 7, 3, and 1 patients,respectively, and 43, 7, 3, and 1 primary tumors, respectively. Eighteen (33.3%) of the 54 primary tumors showed pCR. Sensitivity, specificity, positivepredictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of PERCIST to predict pCR were 100% (18/18), 30.6% (11/36), 41.9% (18/43), 100% (11/11), and53.7% (29/54), respectively. An optimal percent decrease in peak standardizeduptake value for a primary tumor corrected for lean body mass (SULpeak) of 84.3% was found to have a sensitivity of 77.8% (14/18), specificity of 77.8% (28/36),PPV of 63.6% (14/22), NPV of 87.5% (28/32), and accuracy of 77.8% (42/54). Seven (12.5%) of the 56 patients developed recurrent disease (median follow-up28.1 months, range 11.4-96.4 months). CMR (p = 0.031), pCR (p = 0.024), and earlyTNM stage (p = 0.033) were significantly associated with longer PFS.CONCLUSION: PERCIST is useful for predicting pathological response and prognosis following NAC in breast cancer patients. However, FDG-PET/CT showed a tendencytoward underestimation of the residual tumor, and relatively low specificity and PPV of PERCIST showed that a combination of other imaging modalities would still be needed to predict pCR.DOI: 10.1007/s00259-018-4008-1 PMID: 29754160
