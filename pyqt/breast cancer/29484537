High premenopausal incidence is distinctive in East-Asian breastcancer. However, human cell lines derived from Asian primary breast tumor arerare. To provide alternative cell line models with a relevant genetic background,we aimed to establish breast cancer cell lines from Taiwanese patients ofHan-Chinese ethnicity. Fresh tissue from mammary tumors were digested intoorganoids, plated and grown in basal serum-free medium of human mammaryepithelial cells (HuMEC) with supplements. Cells were further enriched bypositive selection with CD326 (epithelial cell adhesion molecule; EpCAM)-coatedmicro-magnetic beads. Two breast cancer cell lines derived from premenopausalwomen were successfully established by this method, and named Chang-Gung BreastCancer 01 (CGBC 01) and 02 (CGBC 02). These two cell lines had a similarphenotype with weak expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor(PR), and without amplification of receptor tyrosine protein kinase erbB-2(HER2/neu). Genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) array showedmultiple copy number alterations in both cell lines. Based on gene expressionprofiles, CGBC 01 and 02 were clustered into basal-like subtype with reference tothe breast cancer cell line gene expression database. The tumorigenicity of both cell lines was extremely low in both anchorage-independence assay andtransplantation into the mammary fat pads of nude mice. CGBC 01 and CGBC 02 arelow tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines, established from Han-Chinesepremenopausal breast cancer patients, which serve as in vitro models in studying the biological features of Asian breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s13577-017-0197-3 PMCID: PMC5852199PMID: 29484537  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
