We reviewed our initial experience with proton APBI and felt that a detaileddescription of these effects were needed to permit a common tool to compareexperience with this developing technology. Methods: Sixty sequential patientstreated with proton APBI on a prospective protocol were evaluated and 43 patientswith a minimum six-month follow-up underwent detailed photographic and radiologicanalysis. The tumorectomy cavity plus an additional 1.5 cm clinical target volume(CTV) was treated with two or three passively-scattered proton beams to a dose of34 Gy in 10 fractions in one week. Photographs were taken at the end ofradiation, at two weeks, six weeks, and every six months thereafter. Mammography was obtained at six months after radiation and annually thereafter. All visualchanges were categorized using the smallest meaningful gradations in findings andare demonstrated herein. All treatment-related mammographic findings arereported. Findings: Visual and mammographic findings showed a cleartime-dependent relationship and significant variation between individuals. Peakskin reaction occurred at two to six weeks after completion of therapy. At twoweeks most patients had either no visible effects and patchy erythema involving<50% of the treated skin (60%). At six weeks most patients had either patchyerythema involving <50% of the overlying skin (33%) or patchy erythema involving >50% of the treated skin (28%). Only one patient developed any moistdesquamation. At six months most patients had no visible skin changes (57%) or a small, circular area of mild hyperpigmentation (33%). Mammographic changes seenat six months were regional skin thickening (40%), residual seroma (14%),localized retraction (26%), and fat necrosis (2%). A subcategorized variant onthe CTCAE 4.0 was developed to foster granular recording of these findings.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10040111 PMCID: PMC5923366PMID: 29642467
