Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become standard of care as a complement to surgery in locally advanced or poor-prognosis early stage disease. Theachievement of a complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy correlates withprognosis but it is not possible to predict who will obtain an excellentresponse. The molecular analysis of the tumor offers a unique opportunity tounveil predictive factors. In this work, gene expression profiling in 279 tumorsamples from patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy was performed andprobabilistic graphical models were used. This approach enables addressingbiological and clinical questions from a Systems Biology perspective, allowing todeal with large gene expression data and their interactions. Tumors presentingcomplete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a higher activity of immunerelated functions compared to resistant tumors. Similarly, samples from complete responders presented higher expression ​​of lymphocyte cell lineage markers,immune-activating and immune-suppressive markers, which may correlate with tumor infiltration by lymphocytes (TILs). These results suggest that the patient'simmune system plays a key role in tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment.However, future studies with larger cohorts are necessary to validate thesehypotheses.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25496 PMCID: PMC6021258PMID: 29963222
