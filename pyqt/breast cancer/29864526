[Epub ahead of print]Why breast cancer signatures are no better than random signatures explained.Goh WWB(1), Wong L(2).Author information: (1)School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.Electronic address: wilsongoh@ntu.edu.sg.(2)Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore;Department of Pathology, National University of Singapore, Singapore. Electronic address: wongls@comp.nus.edu.sg.Random signature superiority (RSS) occurs when random gene signatures outperform published and/or known signatures. Unlike reproducibility and generalizabilityissues, RSS is relatively underexplored. Yet, understanding it is imperative for better analytical outcome. In breast cancer, RSS correlates strongly withenrichment for proliferation genes and signature size. Removal of proliferationgenes from random signatures reduces the predictive power of random signatures.Almost all genes are correlated to a certain extent with the proliferationsignature, making complete elimination of its confounding effects impossible. RSSgoes beyond breast cancer, because it also exists in other diseases; it isespecially strong in other cancers in a platform-independent manner, and lesssevere, but present nonetheless, in nonproliferative diseases.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
