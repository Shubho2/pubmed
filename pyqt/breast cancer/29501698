Electronic address: ykanno@phar.toho-u.ac.jp.HER2 overexpression accounts for approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers. Wehave shown that HER2 overexpression leads to elevated expression of the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in breast cancer cells. In this study, firstly, weshowed that AhR expression was up-regulated by treatment with the HER3 ligandheregulin (HRG) in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines. Induction of AhRwas mediated by transcriptional activation of the region of AhR promotercorresponding to - 190 to - 100 bp. In addition, HRG treatment elicited nucleartranslocation of AhR. To investigate the role of AhR in HRG-HER2/HER3 signalingin HER2-overexpressing cells, we established AhR knockout (KO)HER2-overexpressing cells to perform wound-healing assays. HRG-induced cellmigration was markedly attenuated by AhR KO. HRG-induced cell migration wasassociated with increased expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-8 in wild type cells, but not in AhR KO cells. These resultselucidate that AhR is an important factor for the malignancy in HER2overexpressing breast cancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
