[Epub ahead of print]Sepsis and Risk of Cancer Among Elderly Adults in the United States.Liu Z(1), Mahale P(1), Engels EA(1).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute,Rockville, Maryland, USA.Background: Sepsis is an important cause of mortality among older adults in theUnited States. The association between sepsis and subsequent risk of cancer ispoorly understood.Methods: We conducted a case-control study in US adults using the Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. We included1,801,156 cases with a first cancer diagnosis in SEER during 1992-2013 (ages66-115 years) and 200,000 cancer-free controls from a 5% random sample ofMedicare beneficiaries. Sepsis was identified using inpatient Medicare claims.Associations with sepsis were estimated using logistic regression.Results: After correction for multiple comparisons, sepsis was significantlyassociated with increased risk for cancers of the colon (adjusted OR=1.12),rectum (1.13), liver (1.47), lung (1.17), and cervix (1.52), as well as acutemyeloid leukemia (AML, 1.19), chronic myeloid leukemia (1.54), andmyelodysplastic syndrome (1.30). Inverse associations were observed for cancersof the breast (adjusted OR=0.86), prostate (0.75), kidney (0.90), and thyroid(0.68), and melanoma (0.83), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (0.89) and follicular lymphoma (0.65). Sepsis was significantly associated with 9 of these cancers inthe period >5 years following sepsis diagnosis: cancers of thyroid, prostate,colon, rectum, lung, and liver, and follicular lymphoma, melanoma, and AML.Conclusions: Sepsis is associated with increased or decreased risks for a smallgroup of cancers. Factors that may explain these associations include etiologiceffects of bacterial infections, inflammation, or use of antibiotics. Otherassociations may reflect the presence of precursor conditions (e.g., cirrhosis,colorectal polyps) or patterns in ascertainment of cancer and screening.DOI: 10.1093/cid/ciy530 PMID: 29982318
