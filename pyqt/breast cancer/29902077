Multivariate-adjusted risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effect model.Difference in biospecimen proportions of LC n-3 FA between BC cases and non-caseswere analyzed as a standardized mean difference (SMD).RESULTS: Thirteen cohort and eleven case-control studies were eligible for thepresent meta-analysis. The estimated SMD was -0.14 (95% CI: -0.27, -0.11) for LC n-3 FA and -0.27 (95% CI: -0.42, -0.11) for LC n-3/n-6 FA ratio. When comparingthe top tertiles with the bottom baseline levels, circulating LC n-3 FA wassignificantly associated with a lower risk of BC (RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.96), but not AT (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.70, 1.48). Significant inverse dose-responseassociations were observed for each 1% increment of circulating 20:5n-3 and22:6n-3.CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis highlights that circulating LC n-3 FA as abiomarker of intake may be an independent predictive factor for BC, especially20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3.DOI: 10.1080/10408398.2018.1485133 PMID: 29902077
