Previous studies suggest that sonographic features of a primary tumor have the potential to predict ALN status in the preoperativestaging of breast cancer. In this study, a computer-aided prediction (CAP) model as well as the tumor features for ALN metastasis in breast cancers were developedusing breast ultrasound (US) images.METHODS: A total of 249 malignant tumors were acquired from 247 female patients(ages 20-84 years; mean 55 ± 11 years) to test the differences between thenon-metastatic (130) and metastatic (119) groups based on various features. Afterapplying semi-automatic tumor segmentation, 69 quantitative features wereextracted. The features included morphology and texture of tumors inside a ROI ofbreast US image. By the backward feature selection and linear logisticregression, the prediction model was constructed and established to estimate the likelihood of ALN metastasis for each sample collected.RESULTS: In the experiments, the texture features showed higher performance forpredicting ALN metastasis compared to morphology (Az, 0.730 vs 0.667). Thedifference, however, was not statistically significant (p-values > 0.05).Combining the textural and morphological features, the accuracy, sensitivity,specificity, and Az value achieved 75.1% (187/249), 79.0% (94/119), 71.5%(93/130), and 0.757, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed CAP model, which combines textural and morphologicalfeatures of primary tumor, may be a useful method to determine the ALN status in patients with breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
