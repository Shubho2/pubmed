Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the etiologyof tumor development and identify actionable gene aberrations to improveprevention and therapy. Here, 76 sporadic tumors (48 breast, 22 ovarian, and six uterine) from 76 AYA females (age range, 25-39 years) were subjected to wholeexome and RNA sequencing to determine their mutational signatures and actionable gene profiles. Two individuals with breast cancer (4.2% of cases) and one withovarian cancer (5.3% of cases) carried germline BRCA2 mutations. The two caseswith breast tumors also each carried an additional deleterious germline mutation:one in TP53 and the other in CHEK2. Mutational signature analysis of the 76tumors indicated that spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine and activity ofthe APOBEC cytidine deaminase protein family are major causes of mutagenesis. In addition, 18 breast or ovarian tumors (18/70, 26%), including the three caseswith germline BRCA2 mutations, exhibited a predominant "BRCAness" mutationalsignature, an indicator of functional BRCA1/BRCA2 deficiency. Actionableaberrations and high tumor mutation burdens were detected in 24 breast (50%), 17 ovarian (77%), and five uterine (83%) tumor cases. Thus, mutational processes andaberrant genes in AYA tumors are largely shared with those identified in non-AYA tumors. The efficacy of molecular targeting and immune checkpoint inhibitorytherapies should be explored for both AYA and non-AYA patients.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23765 PMCID: PMC5814207PMID: 29464067
