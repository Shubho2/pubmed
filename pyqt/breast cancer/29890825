In this regard, anti-metastatic genes have potential for metastasisinhibition strategies. Recent evidence showed the importance of breast cancermetastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) in control of OS invasiveness, but the regulationof BRMS1 in OS remains largely unknown. Here, we used bioinformatics analyses to predict BRMS1-targeting microRNAs (miRNAs), and the functional binding of miRNAs to BRMS1 mRNA was evaluated using a dual luciferase reporter assay. Among allBRMS1-targeting miRNAs, only miR-151b, miR-7-5p and miR-3200-5p showedsignificant expression in OS specimens. Specifically, we found that onlymiR-3200-5p significantly inhibited protein translation of BRMS1 via pairing tothe 3'-UTR of the BRMS1 mRNA. Moreover, we detected significantly lower BRMS1 andsignificantly higher miR-3200-5p in the OS specimens compared to the pairedadjacent non-tumour bone tissues. Furthermore, BRMS1 and miR-3200-5p levels were inversely correlated to each other. Low BRMS1 was correlated with metastasis and poor patient survival. In vitro, overexpression of miR-3200-5p significantlydecreased BRMS1 levels and promoted OS cell invasion and migration, whiledepletion of miR-3200-5p significantly increased BRMS1 levels and inhibited OScell invasion and migration. Thus, our study revealed that miR-3200-5p may be acritical regulator of OS cell invasiveness.DOI: 10.14348/molcells.2018.2200 PMCID: PMC6030248PMID: 29890825
