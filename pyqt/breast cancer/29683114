Multinomial logisticregression identified phenotypic and genotypic characteristics.RESULTS: Three executive function and concentration trajectory subgroups wereidentified.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Advancing age, greater pretherapy fatigue, and poorerpretherapy cognitive function are associated with the low subgroups. DNA repairand oxidative stress mechanisms may be involved in the cognitive changes thatwomen experience.DOI: 10.1188/18.ONF.308-326 PMCID: PMC6052441 [Available on 2018-11-01]PMID: 29683114
