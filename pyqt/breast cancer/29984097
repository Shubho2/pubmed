A direct regularization imaging (DRI) method for NIRST has the value of not requiring any imagesegmentation. Here, we present a comprehensive investigational study to analyzethe impact of the weighting function implied when weighting the recovery ofoptical coefficients in DRI based NIRST. This was done using simulations, phantomand clinical patient exam data. Simulations where the true object is knownindicate that changes to this weighting function can vary the contrast by 10%,the contrast to noise ratio by 20% and the full width half maximum (FWHM) by 30%.The results from phantoms and human images show that a linear inverse distanceweighting function appears optimal, and that incorporation of this function cangenerally improve the recovered total hemoglobin contrast of the tumor to thenormal surrounding tissue by more than 15% in human cases.DOI: 10.1364/BOE.9.003266 PMCID: PMC6033579PMID: 29984097
