China.The present study aimed to observe the effects of sulindac sulfide on theproliferation and apoptosis of human breast cancer cells MCF-7, and to explorethe potential underlying molecular mechanism. The inhibitory ratio was detectedusing a cell counting kit-8 assay. The changes in cell cycle distribution wereassessed using flow cytometry (FCM). Furthermore, the changes in cell apoptosisrates were detected by Hoechst 33258 staining and FCM coupled with AnnexinV-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining. In addition, the protein expression wasdetected using western blotting. Sulindac sulfide was able to inhibit theproliferation of breast cancer in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition,sulindac sulfide altered the cell cycle of breast cancer cells. The results ofHoechst 33258 staining and FCM coupled with Annexin V-FITC/PI stainingdemonstrated that sulindac sulfide could significantly induce the apoptosis ofMCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent, and time-dependent manner. The western blotanalysis demonstrated the protein expression of Bcl-2 was downregulated, and Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were upregulated. The results of the present study suggest that sulindac sulfide can inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis ofMCF-7 cells.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8331 PMCID: PMC5962841PMID: 29849803
