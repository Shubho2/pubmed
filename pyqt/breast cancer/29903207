Applepolyphenol inhibition of cell 's migration was more significant between 400 and800 μg/mL.CONCLUSION: Apple polyphenol inhibited the vitality, cell growth andproliferation, and migration of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 by decreasing the proteins expression of UHRF1 and MMP2, and the downstream targets of UHRF1, DNMT3a and DNMT3 b, also decreased.PMID: 29903207
