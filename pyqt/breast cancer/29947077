This study aims to assess the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of TILs in BC and its relationship with immune cellsubtypes.METHOD: Immunohistochemically-defined immune cell subtypes; T-cell markers (CD3, CD8, and FOXP3), B-cell marker (CD20) and histiocytic marker (CD68) wereevaluated in a large series (n=1,165) of invasive BC. A subset of full-facehaematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides were examined for TILs heterogeneity within primary tumours and the corresponding local recurrent carcinomas to reporton spatial and temporal TILs heterogeneity. H&E stained sections from multipletumour blocks (3-4 blocks per case) representing different tumour areas wereevaluated to assess TILS inter-slide heterogeneity as well as intra-slideheterogeneity. Both average (AV-TILs) and hotspot (HS-TILs) stromal TILs wereassessed.RESULTS: AV-TILs showed association with all immune cell subtypes however; themain component were CD3+ cells (mean number = 55) whereas CD20+cells comprisedthe least component (the mean number = 13). There was no significant statistical difference between TILs across tumour blocks of the same case (p=0.251 forAV-TILs and p=0.162 for HS-TILs). Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) showedhigher TILs compared with other BC subtypes (p<0.001). High AV-TILs, CD3+, CD8+, and CD20+ cells were associated with longer survival in TNBC (p<0.05). HighAV-TILs in recurrent tumours showed significant association with shorterpost-recurrence survival (p=0.004).CONCLUSION: Despite the heterogeneity of immune cell type components, averageTILs in one full-face H&E stained section reliably represent whole tumour TILs.TILs were associated with outcome in TNBC as well as provided prognosticsignificance in recurrent tumour.
