Given the high prevalence of patients withbreast cancer, health-care costs of bone metastases (>$20,000 per episode) imposea tremendous economic burden on society. To investigate mechanisms of bonemetastasis, we developed femoral artery injection of cancer cells as aphysiologically relevant model of bone metastasis. Comparing young (~6 weeks),skeletally immature mice to old (~6 months) female mice with closed physes(growth plates), we showed significantly greater progression of osteolyticmetastases in young animals. Bone destruction increased in the old mice followingovariectomy, emphasizing the pathologic consequences of greater bone turnover andnet loss. Despite uniform initial distribution of breast cancer cells throughout the hind limb after femoral artery injection, we observed preferential formation of osteolytic bone metastases in the proximal tibia. Tropism for the proximaltibia arises in part because of TGF-Î², a cytokine abundant in both physes ofskeletally immature mice and matrix of bone in mice of all ages. We also showedthat age-dependent effects on osteolytic bone metastases did not occur in malemice with disseminated breast cancer cells in bone. These studies establish amodel system to specifically focus on pathophysiology and treatment of bonemetastases and underscore the need to match biologic variables in the model torelevant subsets of patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.18383/j.tom.2018.00010 PMCID: PMC6035009PMID: 29984313
