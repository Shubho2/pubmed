Importantly, gastric cancer that is synchronouslypresented with lobular breast cancer can be misdiagnosed as primary gastriccancer; therefore, accurate differential diagnosis is required.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 39-year-old woman was visited to our hospital because ofright breast mass and progressive dyspepsia.DIAGNOSES: Invasive lobular carcinoma of breast was diagnosed on core needlebiopsy. Gastroscopy revealed a diffuse scirrhous mass at the prepyloric antrumand diagnosed as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma on biopsy. Synchronousdouble primary breast and gastric cancers were considered. Detailed pathological analysis focused on immunohistochemical studies of selected antibodies, includingthose of estrogen receptors, gross cystic disease fluid protein-15, andcaudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2, were studied. As a result, gastriclesion was diagnosed as metastatic gastric cancer originating from breast.INTERVENTIONS: Right breast conserving surgery was performed, and duodenal stent was inserted under endoscopic guidance to relieve the patient's symptoms.Systemic chemotherapy with combined administration of paclitaxel and trastuzumab was initiated.OUTCOMES: Forty-one months after the diagnosis, the patient is still undergoingthe same therapy. No recurrent lesion has been identified in the breast andevidence of a partial remission of gastric wall thickening has been observed onfollow-up studies without new metastatic lesions.LESSONS: Clinical suspicion, repeat endoscopic biopsy, and detailed histological analysis, including immunohistochemistry, are necessary for diagnosis ofmetastatic gastric cancer from the breast.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010258 PMCID: PMC5895432PMID: 29595684  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
