The degree ofdisparity in access to radiation therapy (RT) for Hispanic-American patients withcancer has not been previously examined in an extensive manner.Methods and materials: An extensive literature search was performed using thePubMed database to examine studies investigating disparities in RT access forHispanic-Americans.Results: A total of 34 studies were found, spanning 10 organ systems. Disparitiesin access to RT for Hispanic-Americans were most prominently studied in cancersof the breast (15 studies), prostate (4 studies), head and neck (4 studies), and gynecologic system (3 studies). Disparities in RT access for Hispanic-Americanswere prevalent regardless of the organ system studied and were compounded bylimited English proficiency and/or birth outside of the United States. A total of26 of 34 studies (77%) involved analysis of a population-based database, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (15 studies); Surveillance,Epidemiology and End Result-Medicare (4 studies); National Cancer Database (3studies); or a state tumor registry (4 studies).Conclusions: Hispanic-Americans in the United States have diminished RT accesscompared with Caucasian patients but are less likely to experience concomitantdisparities in mortality than other underrepresented minorities that experiencesimilar disparities (ie, African-Americans). Hispanic-Americans who are bornoutside of the United States and/or have limited English proficiency may be more likely to experience substandard RT access. These results underscore theimportance of finding nationwide solutions to address such inequalities thathinder Hispanic-Americans and other underrepresented minorities throughout theUnited States.DOI: 10.1016/j.adro.2017.12.003 PMCID: PMC6000066PMID: 29904731
