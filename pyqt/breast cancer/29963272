It has been noticed that new organic ester ligand,O,O'-diethyl-(S,S)-ethylenediamine-N,N'-di-2-(3-cyclohexyl)propanoatedihydrochloride (named DE-EDCP) showed effective cytotoxic capacities againstseveral human and mouse cancer cell lines. However, its effects on tumor growthand metastasis are unexplored. The aim of present study was to examine theability of DE-EDCP to inhibit 4T1 murine breast cancer growth and progression andto explore possible molecular mechanisms. DE-EDCP exhibited significanttumoricidal activity on human and murine breast cancer cell lines. Further,marked reduction of murine breast cancer growth and progression by DE-EDCP wasshown. DE-EDCP exhibits fewer side-effects compared to cisplatin as aconventional chemotherapeutic. Results obtained from in vivo and in vitroexperiments indicate that DE-EDCP induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of4T1 cells. DE-EDCP increases percentage of 4T1 cells in late apoptosis,expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase-3, while decreases expression ofanti-apoptotic Bcl-2. DE-EDCP treatment increased the percentage ofTUNEL-positive nuclei and reduced Ki-67 expression in breast cancer tissue.DE-EDCP decreased expression of cyclin D3 and Ki-67, increased expression ofcyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16, p21 and p27 and arrested 4T1 cells inG0/G1 cell cycle phase. Expression of STAT3 and downstream regulated molecules,NANOG and SOX2, was reduced in 4T1 cells after DE-EDCP treatment. In conclusion, DE-EDCP impairs breast cancer growth and progression by triggering cancer celldeath and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. DE-EDCP might be of interestin the development of the new anticancer agent.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25610 PMCID: PMC6021340PMID: 29963272
