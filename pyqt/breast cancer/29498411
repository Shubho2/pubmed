There is no effectivetargeted treatment available for the TNBC sufferers. Ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) have been previously proposed as drug targets for TNBC based on observations that85% of these tumors express activated RSKs.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein we examined an involvement of RSK1 (p90 ribosomalS6 kinase 1) in a regulation of TNBC growth and metastatic spread in an animalmodel, which closely imitates human disease. Mice were inoculated into mammaryfat pad with 4T1 cells or their RSK1-depleted variant. We examined tumor growthand formation of pulmonary metastasis. Boyden chamber, wound healing and softagarose assays were performed to evaluate cells invasion, migration andanchorage-independent growth.RESULTS: We found that RSK1 promoted tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. After35 days all animals inoculated with control cells developed tumors while in thegroup injected with RSK1-negative cells, there were 75% tumor-bearing mice.Average tumor mass was estimated as 1.16 g and 0.37 g for RSK1-positive vs.-negative samples, respectively (p < 0.0001). Quantification of the macroscopicpulmonary metastases indicated that mice with RSK1-negative tumors developedapproximately 85% less metastatic foci on the lung surface (p < 0.001). This has been supported by in vitro data presenting that RSK1 promotedanchorage-independent cell growth and migration. Moreover, RSK1 knock-downcorresponded with decreased expression of cell cycle regulating proteins, i.e.cyclin D3, CDK6 and CDK4.CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that RSK1 supports tumor growth and metastaticspread in vivo as well as in vitro migration and survival in non-adherentconditions. Further studies of RSK1 involvement in TNBC progression maysubstantiate our findings, laying the foundations for development ofanti-RSK1-based therapeutic strategies in the management of patients with TNBC.DOI: 10.5603/FHC.a2018.0001 PMID: 29498411
