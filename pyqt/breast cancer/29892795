Emerging evidence shows thatmiR-135a is down-regulated in breast cancer cells, but the functional roles ofmiR-135a in breast cancer cells remains unexplored. For this purpose, weinvestigated the expression of miR-135a in breast cancer cells and explored itsfunctional role during breast cancer progression. In vitro study showed thatmiR-135a may be a novel tumor suppressor. Further studies showed thattranscription factors ELK1 and ELK3 are direct target genes of miR-135a thatmodulates the suppressive function of miR-135a in breast cancer cells. Inducedexpression of miR-135a significantly downregulated the expression of ELK1 andELK3 both at mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, the effect of miR-135a inMCF-7 and T47D cells was investigated by the overexpression of miR-135a mimics.In vitro, induced expression of miR-135a in breast cancer cells inhibited cellProliferation and clongenicity. Moreover, a luciferase activity assay revealedthat miR-135a could directly target the 3'-untranslated region (3' UTRS) of ELK1 and ELK3 oncogenes. In addition, rescue experiment demonstrated that the promotedcell growth by transcription factors ELK1 and ELK3 was attenuated by theover-expression of miR-135a. Our study demonstrates that miR-135a regulates cell proliferation in breast cancer by targeting ELK1 and ELK3 oncogenes, and suggeststhat miR-135a potentially can act as a tumor suppressor.DOI: 10.1007/s13258-017-0624-6 PMID: 29892795
