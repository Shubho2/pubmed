We investigated for the first time the potentialcardiotoxic effects of pertuzumab and TDM1, which are not yet fully elucidated,and we tested whether ranolazine could blunt their cardiotoxicity.Methods: The cardiotoxic effects were tested in vitro on rat cardiomyoblasts,human fetal cardiomyocytes, adult-like cardiomyocytes, and in vivo on a mousemodel.Results: All the treated cardiac cell lines were significantly affected bytreatment with the tested drugs. Surprisingly, TDM1 showed stronger inhibitoryeffects on cardiac cells with respect to trastuzumab and pertuzumab by moresignificantly reducing the cell viability and by changing the morphology of thesecells. TDM1 also affected the beating phenotype of adult-like cardiomyocytes invitro and reduced fractional shortening and ejection fraction in vivo in a mouse model. We also found that ranolazine attenuated not only the cardiotoxic sideeffects of trastuzumab but also those of pertuzumab and TDM1, when used incombinatorial treatments both in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by therecovery of fractional shortening and ejection fraction values in mice pretreatedwith TDM1.Conclusion: We demonstrated that it is possible to predict the eventualcardiotoxic effects of novel approved anticancer drugs early by using in vitroand in vivo approaches, which can also be useful to screen in advance thecardioprotective agents, so as to avoid the onset of unwanted cardiotoxic sideeffects.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S157294 PMCID: PMC5914739PMID: 29719406
