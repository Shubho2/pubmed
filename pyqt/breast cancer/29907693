Cancer cell-derived IFN-I is required to recruitBATF3-dependent dendritic cells (DC) to poorly immunogenic tumors and triggerantitumor T-cell responses in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. Wehave previously demonstrated that the exonuclease TREX1 regulates radiationimmunogenicity by degrading cytosolic dsDNA. Tumor-derived DNA can also activate cGAS/STING-mediated production of IFN-I by DCs infiltrating immunogenic tumors.However, how DNA from cancer cells is transferred to the cytoplasm of DCs remainsunclear. Here, we showed that tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) produced by irradiatedmouse breast cancer cells (RT-TEX) transfer dsDNA to DCs and stimulate DCupregulation of costimulatory molecules and STING-dependent activation of IFN-I. In vivo, RT-TEX elicited tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and protected mice from tumor development significantly better than TEX from untreated cancer cells in a prophylactic vaccination experiment. We demonstrated that theIFN-stimulatory dsDNA cargo of RT-TEX is regulated by TREX1 expression in theparent cells. Overall, these results identify RT-TEX as a mechanism wherebyIFN-stimulatory dsDNA is transferred from irradiated cancer cells to DCs. We havepreviously shown that the expression of TREX1 is dependent on the RT dose size.Thus, these data have important implications for the use of RT withimmunotherapy.
