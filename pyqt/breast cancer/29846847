After a medianfollow-up of 52 months, a report from the Swedish Multicenter Cohort Studypresented a worse cancer-specific and event-free survival for patients withmicrometastases than node-negative individuals, but could not demonstrate asignificant difference in overall survival (OS). Due to the tendency of breastcancer to relapse after more than 5-10 years, we now report the long-termsurvival of the cohort.METHODS: Between September 2000 and January 2004, 3355 breast cancer patientswere included in a prospective cohort. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was alwaysperformed. Patients were classified in four groups according to their overallnodal stage: node negative (N0, 2372), ITCs (113), micrometastases (123), andmacrometastases (747). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox proportionalhazard regression models were applied.RESULTS: Median follow-up was 156 months. Ten-year cancer-specific survival andOS were significantly lower in case of micrometastases than in N0 (84.7 vs.93.5%, p = 0.001, and 75.5 vs. 84.2%, p = 0.046, respectively). In case ofmacrometastases, corresponding survival rates were 82.8 and 74.3%. Only for thoseaged less than 50 years, cancer-specific survival and OS were significantly worsein case of ITCs than N0. Patients with micrometastases received less oftenchemotherapy than those with macrometastases (24.4 vs. 53.9%).CONCLUSIONS: Lymph node micrometastases in breast cancer have a prognosticsignificance. This study demonstrates a similar survival for patients withmicrometastases and those with macrometastases, possibly due to systemicundertreatment.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4820-0 PMID: 29846847
