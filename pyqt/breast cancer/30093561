This observation led us to investigate whetherinhibition of p38MAPKα could reduce breast cancer metastases in a clinicallyrelevant model. Orally administered, small-molecule inhibitors of p38MAPKα or itsdownstream kinase MK2, each limited outgrowth of metastatic breast cancer cellsin the bone and visceral organs. This effect was primarily mediated by inhibitionof the p38MAPKα pathway within the stromal compartment. Beyond effectivelylimiting metastatic tumor growth, these inhibitors reduced tumor-associated andchemotherapy-induced bone loss, which is a devastating comorbidity thatdrastically impacts quality of life for cancer patients. These data underscorethe vital role played by stromal-derived factors in tumor progression andidentify the p38MAPK-MK2 pathway as a promising therapeutic target for metastaticdisease and prevention of tumor-induced bone loss.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-0234 PMID: 30093561
