It requires good communicationskills, understanding, and empathy on the part of a clinician. Communication has both verbal and non-verbal components. The requirement for non-verbalcommunication varies with various diverse groups, depending upon their culturaland religious beliefs. Breaking bad news in an ethnically diverse group iscomplex where cultural, religious, and language barriers may exist. The National Health Service was established in 1948. Ethnic minority comprised of only 0.2%(53,000) of the total population. The health care professionals shared the samecultural backgrounds as their patients at that time. Census in 2011 indicatesthat the number of the ethnically diverse group has increased to 14% (2 million) in England and Wales. Eighty-six percent of the population was white British.Asians (Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi, and other) "groups" made up 7.5% of thepopulation; black groups 3.4%; Chinese groups 0.7%; Arab groups 0.4%; and othergroups 0.6%. This figure is expected to increase by 20%-30% in 2050. It is,therefore, important that a doctor working within the National Health Service in the UK, should be prepared to deal with patients who may have a differentculture, faith, language, and set of beliefs. In this article, I have highlightedthe various challenges/issues in communication with such patients, availableresources, and recommendations of strategies to improve their care.Unfortunately, no one single strategy can be applied to all as each patientshould be recognized individually and as such, different factors have differentweightings on each consultation. It is, therefore, important that hospitals raisecultural and religious awareness so that the doctors can be more understandingtoward their patients. This will not only improve the patient's experience,medical staff would also feel professionally satisfied.DOI: 10.2147/JMDH.S166660 PMCID: PMC6037409PMID: 30013358
