In previous work, weshowed that phosphorylation on S1943 promotes myosin-IIA filament disassembly in vitro and enhances EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension of breast tumor cells.However, the contribution of NMHC-IIA S1943 phosphorylation to the modulation of invasive cellular behavior and metastasis has not been examined. Stableexpression of phosphomimetic (S1943E) or non-phosphorylatable (S1943A) NMHC-IIAin breast cancer cells revealed that S1943 phosphorylation enhances invadopodiafunction, and is critical for matrix degradation in vitro and experimentalmetastasis in vivo. These studies demonstrate a novel link between NMHC-IIA S1943phosphorylation, the regulation of extracellular matrix degradation and tumorcell invasion and metastasis.Copyright Â© 2018.
