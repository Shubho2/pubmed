Swingle(Simaroubaceae). The mechanism that underlies the activity of ailanthone on MCF-7cells was investigated by MTT assay. Breast cancer MCF-7 cells were treated with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 Âµg/ml ailanthone for 24, 48 and 72 h. The inhibitionof proliferation induced by treatment with ailanthone was assessed by MTT assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in MCF-7 cells with the same doses ofailanthone for 48 h were determined by flow cytometry. Expression ofapoptosis-associated genes and proteins were analyzed by reversetranscription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis,respectively. The results revealed that ailanthone inhibited MCF-7 cellproliferation. Flow cytometry assay demonstrated that ailanthone inducedapoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells. Western blotting and RT-PCRassays demonstrated that upregulation of pro-apoptotic caspase-3 andBcl-associated X, and downregulation of anti-apoptotic apoptosis regulator B-celllymphoma-2 in MCF-7 cells may be associated with the induction of apoptosis andinhibition of proliferation. To the best of our knowledge, the present study isthe first to investigate the antitumor activity of ailanthone from A. altissimaon MCF-7 cells and to attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanism. The present study revealed the presence of ailanthone-mediated antitumor effects, indicating that ailanthone may be a novel phytomedicine with potential use in breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8039 PMCID: PMC5840722PMID: 29552229
