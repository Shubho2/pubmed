Thisinitiative provided funding and infrastructure to foster coordination of an IBCWorld Consortium of national and international experts, and launch the first everIBC international conference in 2008, which brought together experts from around the world to facilitate collaborations and accelerate progress. Indeed greatprogress has been made since then. National and international experts in IBCconvened at the 10th Anniversary Conference of the MD Anderson IBC Clinic andResearch Program and presented the most extensive sequencing analysis to datecomparing IBC to non-IBC, gene- and protein-based immunoprofiling of IBC versusnon-IBC patients, and converging lines of evidence on the specific role of themicroenvironment in IBC. Novel models, unique metabolic mechanisms, and prominentsurvival pathways have been identified and were presented. Multiple clinicaltrials based on the work of the last decade are in progress or in development.The important challenges ahead were discussed. This progress and a coordinatedsummary of these works are presented herein.DOI: 10.7150/jca.21200 PMCID: PMC5687177PMID: 29667990
