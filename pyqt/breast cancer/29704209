Neurologicsymptoms are one of the main reasons for consultation and a common cause ofdecreased quality of life among cancer patients.AIMS: To identify the neurologic manifestations of patients ≥ 65 years of agediagnosed with cancer and compare them to those presented by a youngerpopulation.METHODS: Cross-sectional study of cancer patients referred to neuro-oncologicconsultation at a Cancer Center. Sociodemographic, health and oncologiccharacteristics were obtained through clinical interviews. Clinical symptoms and final diagnoses were also recorded. Bivariate logistic regression analyses werecarried out.RESULTS: More than 17,000 neuro-oncologic consultations in 3015 patients weregiven, 27% (n = 811) of them were ≥ 65 years of age. Most frequent primaryneoplasms in elderly patients were: breast cancer, hematologic neoplasms,gynecological, urologic, skin and head and neck cancers. Elderly patients had an increased risk of having the following diagnoses: abnormal movements, stroke,peripheral vertigo, dementia, degenerative spine disorder, and delirium.DISCUSSION: Elderly patients are considered a vulnerable population. The present study found that the main neoplasms associated with neurological manifestationsare similar to the reported previously. We described the main symptoms that ledto a neuro-oncological assessment. Moreover, we enlisted the final diagnoses madeon elderly patients and compared them with others reports. To the best of ourknowledge, this study provides valuable information, since there is scarceevidence in the literature about this topic.CONCLUSION: Identifying the frequency and correlation of neurologicmanifestations in older cancer patients will allow for the implementation oftimely multidisciplinary care in an attempt to improve these patients'health-related quality of life.DOI: 10.1007/s40520-018-0961-6 PMID: 29704209
