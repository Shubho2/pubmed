A variety of effective strategies to increasephysical activity in breast cancer survivors have been identified. However, it isunknown which of these strategies is most effective or how these strategies mightbe combined to optimize intervention effectiveness.METHODS: The proposed trial uses multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) toevaluate four evidence-based intervention strategies for increasing physicalactivity in breast cancer survivors. We will enroll 500 breast cancer survivors, age 18 and older, who are 3-months to 5 years post-treatment. Using afull-factorial design, participants will be randomized to receive a combination: 1) supervised exercise, 2) facility access, 3) self-monitoring, and 4)group-based active living counseling. The primary outcome, moderate-to-vigorousphysical activity (MVPA) will be measured at baseline, 3 months, and 6 monthsusing an Actigraph GT3X+. To evaluate intervention effects, a linearmixed-effects model will be conducted with MVPA as the outcome and with time(3 months and 6 months) as the within-subjects factor and intervention (i.e.,supervised exercise, facility access, self-monitoring, and active livingcounseling) as the between subjects factor, along with all two-way interactions.DISCUSSION: The purpose of the PACES study is to evaluate multiple strategies forincreasing physical activity in breast cancer survivors. Results of this studywill provide in an optimized intervention for increasing physical activity inbreast cancer survivors.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03060941 .
