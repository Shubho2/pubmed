[Epub ahead of print]ChIP-seq analysis reveals alteration of H3K4 trimethylation occupancy incancer-related genes by cold atmospheric plasma.Lee S(1), Park S(1), Lee H(1), Jeong D(1), Ham J(1), Choi EH(2), Kim SJ(3).Author information: (1)Department of Life Science, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang, Korea.(2)Plasma Bioscience Research Center, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, Korea.(3)Department of Life Science, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang, Korea.Electronic address: sunjungk@dongguk.edu.Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has gained attention for use in cancer treatmentowing to its ability to preferentially induce cancer cell death; however, theinvolved molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Herein, an epigeneticeffect of CAP on cancer cells was examined by performing a genome-wide ChIP-seqfor H3K4me3 in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Consequently, 899 genes showedsignificantly changed methylation level at H3K4 with constructing "CellularCompromise, DNA Replication, Recombination, Repair, and Cell Cycle" as the topnetwork. Comparisons with expression array data revealed a coincidence betweenhistone modification and gene expression for 18 genes, and the association wasconfirmed by ChIP-PCR and qRT-PCR for selected genes. The expression of theaffected genes, such as HSCB and PRPS1, was recovered when a histone demethylase JARID1A was inhibited. Furthermore, JARID1A was induced by CAP via the reactiveoxygen species signaling. The two genes are known as oncogenes and show a higher expression in breast cancer tissue, and this was supported by the decreasedcolony formation ability of MCF-7 cells when the cells were treated with siRNAsagainst each gene. Taken together, these data indicate that CAP inhibits cancercell proliferation by modulating the methylation level of H3K4 corresponding tooncogenes.Copyright Â© 2018.
