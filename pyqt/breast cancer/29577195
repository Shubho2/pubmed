The relationship between IGFBP6 protein and the expression of genes associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition isstudied. Gene IGFBP6 knockdown does not trigger the epithelial-mesenchymaltransition in MDA-MB-231 cells, but modifies significantly the expression of manygenes involved in this process. A decrease of IGFBP6 expression can involve adecrease in the expression of N-cadherin and transcription factor Slug.DOI: 10.1007/s10517-018-4051-8 PMID: 29577195
