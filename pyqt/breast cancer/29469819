The promoter of the HOTAIR gene contains multiple estrogen responseelements (EREs) and is transcriptionally activated by estradiol in estrogenreceptor-positive breast cancer cells. HOTAIR competes with BRCA1, a criticalprotein in breast cancer and is a critical regulator of genes involved inepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. It mediates an oncogenic action of c-Myc,essential for breast carcinogenesis. The carcinogenic action of HOTAIR wasconfirmed in breast cancer stem-like cells, in which it was essential forself-renewal and proliferation. Several miRNAs regulate the expression of HOTAIR and HOTAIR interacts with many miRNAs to support cancer transformation. Manystudies point at miR-34a as a major component of HOTAIR-miRNAs-cancer cross-talk.The most important role of HOTAIR can be attributed to cancer progression as its overexpression stimulates invasion and metastasis. HOTAIR can regulate autophagy,important for breast cancer cells survival, through the interaction with miRNAsspecific for autophagy genes and directly with these genes. The role ofHOTAIR-mediated autophagy in breast cancer progression can be underlined by itsinteraction with matrix metalloproteinases, essential for cancer invasion, andβ-catenin can be important for this interaction. Therefore, there are severalmechanisms of the interplay between HOTAIR and autophagy important for breastcancer, but further studies are needed to determine more details of thisinterplay.DOI: 10.3390/ijms18112317 PMCID: PMC5713286PMID: 29469819
