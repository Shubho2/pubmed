While immediate reconstruction results in superior aesthetic outcomes, the need for postmastectomy radiation can often only beascertained after review of surgical pathology. Delayed-immediate autologousreconstruction (DIAR) is a reconstructive approach that consists of mastectomywith tissue expander placement in the first stage and flap-based breastreconstruction in the second stage. We describe our institution's experience withDIAR to characterize the reasons in which patients opt for this reconstructiveapproach and analyze its ultimate outcomes.METHODS: We conducted an institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review of all consecutive patients undergoing DIAR performed by the senior authorfrom 2007 to 2016. Data gathered included demographics, operative techniques, andpostoperative outcomes.RESULTS: In our study, 17 patients and 26 breasts underwent DIAR. Seven patients initially planned for and eventually underwent DIAR. Ten patients initiallyplanned for implant-based reconstructions but ultimately underwent DIAR instead. Flap types included deep inferior epigastric perforator (n = 6), superficialinferior epigastric artery (n = 2), and muscle-sparing free transverse rectusabdominis myocutaneous (n = 18). The mean time between mastectomy andreconstruction was 208 days. Complications included tissue expander infection,vascular compromise, abscess formation, hematoma, and skin necrosis.CONCLUSIONS: The delayed-immediate approach allows for breast reconstruction withaesthetic and psychosocial benefits, while enabling postmastectomy radiation inpatients with advanced disease. We describe modifications to DIAR, including use of a flap skin paddle and prolonged time between stages, which allow for broader applicability. We show that DIAR accommodates a range of patient preferences withfew complications.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001380 PMID: 29620551
