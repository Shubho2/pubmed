A total of 50 BCpatients at diagnosis underwent PET/MRI before pharmacological and surgicaltreatment. For each primary lesion, the following data were extracted:morphological data including tumour-node-metastasis stage and lesion size;apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC); perfusion data including forward volumetransfer constant (Ktrans), reverse efflux volume transfer constant (Kep) andextravascular extracellular space volume (Ve); and metabolic data includingstandardized uptake value (SUV), lean body mass (SUL), metabolic tumour volumeand total lesion glycolysis. Immunohistochemical reports were used to determinereceptor status (oestrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2), cellular differentiation status (grade), and proliferation index(Ki67) of the tumour lesions. Correlation studies (Mann-Whitney U test andSpearman's test), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, andmultivariate analysis were performed.RESULTS: Association studies were performed to assess the correlations betweenimaging and histological prognostic markers of BC. Imaging biomarkers, whichsignificantly correlated with biological markers, were selected to perform ROCcurve analysis to determine their ability to discriminate among BC subtypes.SUVmax, SUVmean and SUL were able to discriminate between luminal A and luminal Bsubtypes (AUCSUVmean = 0.799; AUCSUVmax = 0.833; AUCSUL = 0.813) and betweenluminal A and nonluminal subtypes (AUCSUVmean = 0.926; AUCSUVmax = 0.917;AUCSUL = 0.945), and the lowest SUV and SUL values were associated with theluminal A subtype. Kepmax was able to discriminate between luminal A and luminal B subtypes (AUC = 0.779), and its highest values were associated with the luminalB subtype. Ktransmax (AUC = 0.881) was able to discriminate between luminal A andnonluminal subtypes, and the highest perfusion values were associated with thenonluminal subtype. In addition, ADC (AUC = 0.877) was able to discriminatebetween luminal B and nonluminal subtypes, and the lowest ADCmean values wereassociated with the luminal B subtype. Multivariate analysis was performed todevelop a prognostic model, and the best predictive model included Ktransmax and SUVmax parameters.CONCLUSION: Using multivariate analysis of both PET and MRI parameters, aprognostic model including Ktransmax and SUVmax was able to predict the tumoursubtype in 38 of 49 patients (77.6%, p < 0.001), with higher accuracy for theluminal B subtype (86.2%).DOI: 10.1007/s00259-018-4010-7 PMID: 29696443
