Widely accepted molecular classification system usesassessment of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and proliferation marker Ki67. Few studies havebeen conducted on the incidence and molecular types of breast cancer inSub-Saharan Africa. Previous studies mainly from Western and Central Africa,showed breast cancer to occur at younger ages and to present with aggressivefeatures, such as high-grade, advanced stage and triple-negative phenotype(negative for ER, PR and HER2). Limited data from East Africa including Ethiopia however shows hormone receptor negative tumors to account for a lower proportion of all breast cancers than has been reported from elsewhere in Africa.METHODS: In this study from Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, 114 breast cancerpatients diagnosed between 2012 and 2015 were enrolled. ER, PR, Ki67 and HER2receptor status were assessed using immunohistochemistry from tissue microarrays.FISH was used for assessment of gene amplification in all equivocal tumor samplesand for confirmation in HER2-enriched cases.RESULTS: The distribution of molecular subtypes was: Luminal A: 40%; Luminal B:26%; HER2-enriched: 10%; TNBC: 23%. ER were positive in 65% of all tumors and 43%the cases were positive for PR. There was statistically significant difference inmedian age at diagnosis between the molecular subtypes (P < 0.05). There was abimodal distribution of molecular subtypes in different age ranges with Luminal Bsubtype being more common at younger ages (median = 36) and Luminal A subtypemore prevalent at older ages (median = 42). There were no statisticallysignificant differences in tumor grade, histology, and stage between themolecular subtypes of breast cancer.CONCLUSION: The present study detected Luminal A breast cancer to be the mostcommon subtype and reveals a relatively low rate of hormone receptor negative andTNBC. Our findings and results from other East African studies suggest geographicvariability in the distribution of the molecular subtypes of breast cancer inAfrica and hence have important clinical and policy implications for breastcancer control and treatment in Ethiopia.DOI: 10.1186/s12905-018-0531-2 PMCID: PMC5813361PMID: 29444670
