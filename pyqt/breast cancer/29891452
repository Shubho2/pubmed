A PD-L1 blocking antibody was applied to theco-culture, and the changes in the inhibitory effect of the MDA-MB-231 cells ondendritic cell maturation was observed. TNF-α-induced dendritic cells weretreated with a recombinant human PD-L1 protein to study the effect of PD-L1/PD-1 pathway activation on the maturation of dendritic cells. The expression of PD-L1 in MDA-MB-231 cells and the dendritic cell maturation marker HLA-DR and CD83 wereanalyzed using flow cytometry.RESULTS: MDA-MB-231 cell line showed PD-L1 positivity on the cell membrane cells at a rate as high as (99.7∓0.15)%. In mature dendritic cells, the positivityrates for HLA-DR and CD83 were (88.8∓6.96)% and (18.36∓3.07)%, respectively, but in the co-culture system, the positivity rates of the dendritic cells weresignificantly decreased to (42.76∓10.52)% (P<0.01) and (9.93∓2.74)% (P<0.05),respectively, indicating that MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited the maturation ofdendritic cells. Following treatment with a PD-L1 antibody isotype control, thepercentages of HLA-DR- and CD83-positive cells in the co-culture were(45.17∓10.19)% and (10.15∓2.54)%, which were significantly increased to(63.46∓1.72)% and (16.46∓2.58)% after treatment with PD-L1 antibody, respectively(both P<0.05). Compared with the mature dendritic cell controls, the cellstreated with the recombinant human PD-L1 protein exhibited significantly lowered percentages of HLA-DR-positive [from (84.23∓4.18)% to (2.56∓2.39)%, P<0.05] andCD83-positive cells [(87.26∓1.54)% to (60.67∓1.63)%, P<0.05].CONCLUSION: The effect of PD-L1 antibody therapy on triple negative breast cancercan be partially mediated by blocking PD-L1 expression on breast cancer cellmembrane, which attenuates the inhibition of dendritic cell maturation in thecancer microenvironment.PMID: 29891452
