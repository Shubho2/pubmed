For these reasons, it is important to ensure exposuresare optimised to give the required clinical image quality with doses that are as low as reasonably achievable. However, there is little guidance on dose levels inradiotherapy CT imaging either within the UK or internationally.&#13; &#13; This IPEM topical report presents the results of the first UK wide survey of doseindices in radiotherapy CT planning scans. Patient dose indices were collectedfor prostate, gynaecological, breast, 3D-lung, 4D-lung, brain and head/neckscans. Median values per scanner and examination type were calculated andnational dose reference levels and 'achievable levels' of CT dose index(CTDIvol), dose-length-product (DLP) and scan length are proposed based on thethird quartile and median values of these distributions, respectively. &#13;&#13; A total of 68 radiotherapy CT scanners were included in this audit. Theproposed dose reference levels for CTDIvol and DLP are; prostate 16 mGy and 570mGy.cm, gynaecological 16 mGy and 610 mGy.cm, breast 10 mGy and 390 mGy.cm,3D-lung 14 mGy and 550 mGy.cm, 4D-lung 63 mGy and 1750 mGy.cm, brain 50 mGy and1500 mGy.cm and head/neck 49 mGy and 2150 mGy.cm. Significant variations in dose indices were noted, with head/neck and 4D-lung yielding a factor of eighteendifference between the lowest and highest dose scanners. There was also evidence of some clustering in the data by scanner manufacturer, which may be indicativeof a lack of local optimisation of individual systems to the clinical task. It isanticipated that providing this data to the UK and wider radiotherapy communitywill aid the optimisation of treatment planning CT scan protocols.&#13.Â© 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.DOI: 10.1088/1361-6560/aacc87 PMID: 29900881
