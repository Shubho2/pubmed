China.The present study aimed to investigate potential recurrence-risk biomarkers basedon significant pathways for Luminal A breast cancer through gene expressionprofile analysis. Initially, the gene expression profiles of Luminal A breastcancer patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Thedifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using a Limma package andthe hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted for the DEGs. In addition, thefunctional pathways were screened using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomespathway enrichment analyses and rank ratio calculation. The multigene prognostic assay was exploited based on the statistically significant pathways and itsprognostic function was tested using train set and verified using the geneexpression data and survival data of Luminal A breast cancer patients downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. A total of 300 DEGs were identified betweengood and poor outcome groups, including 176 upregulated genes and 124downregulated genes. The DEGs may be used to effectively distinguish Luminal Asamples with different prognoses verified by hierarchical clustering analysis.There were 9 pathways screened as significant pathways and a total of 18 DEGsinvolved in these 9 pathways were identified as prognostic biomarkers. According to the survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve, theobtained 18-gene prognostic assay exhibited good prognostic function with highsensitivity and specificity to both the train and test samples. In conclusion the18-gene prognostic assay including the key genes, transcription factor 7-like 2, anterior parietal cortex and lymphocyte enhancer factor-1 may provide a newmethod for predicting outcomes and may be conducive to the promotion of precisionmedicine for Luminal A breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7940 PMCID: PMC5840762PMID: 29545900
