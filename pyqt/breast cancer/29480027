Cell development andsignaling genes were differentially methylated, with histone methylation analysissuggesting distinct H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 enrichment profiles. An integratedanalysis revealed several tumor suppressor genes downregulated in CSCs.CONCLUSION: Differential activation of various signaling pathways and genescontributes to the tumor-promoting properties of CSCs. Therapeutic targetsidentified in the analysis may contribute to improving treatment options forpatients.DOI: 10.2217/epi-2018-0008 PMID: 29480027
