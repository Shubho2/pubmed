Yet, studies report disparities among Medicare-insured women.These studies do not account for the inherent differences in age andcomorbidities between a younger privately insured and an older Medicarepopulation. We examined immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) utilization betweena matched pre- and post-Medicare population.Methods: Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (1992-2013), breastcancer patients undergoing IBR were identified. To minimize confounding medicalvariables, 64-year-old privately insured women were compared with 66-year-oldMedicare-insured women. Demographic data, IBR rates, and complication rates were compared. Trend over time was plotted for both cohorts.Result: A total of 21,402 64-year-old women and 25,568 66-year-old women wereincluded. Both groups were well matched in terms of demographic type ofreconstruction and complication rates. 72.3% of 64-year-old and 71.2 of %66-year-old women opted for mastectomy. Of these, 25.5% (n = 3,941) of64-year-old privately insured and 17.7% (n = 3,213) of 66-year-oldMedicare-insured women underwent IBR (P < 0.01). During the study period, IBRrates increased significantly in both cohorts in a similar cohort.Conclusion: This study demonstrates significant increasing IBR rates in bothcohorts. Moreover, after an initial slower upward trend, after a decade, IBR in66-year-old Medicare-insured women approached similar rates of breastreconstruction among those with private insurance. Trends in unilateral versusbilateral mastectomy are also seen.DOI: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000001552 PMCID: PMC5811278PMID: 29464148
