The role of Wnt5a expression in breast cancer remains elusive. Weinvestigated the significance of Wnt5a expression in breast cancer. Therelationship between Wnt5a expression and clinicopathologic factors was assessed in invasive breast cancer (n = 178) resected at Hiroshima University Hospitalbetween January 2011 and February 2014. Wnt5a was expressed in 69 of 178 cases(39%) of invasive breast cancer and correlated strongly with estrogen receptor(ER) expression (P < 0.001). Wnt5a expression in ER-positive breast cancercorrelated significantly with lymph node metastasis, nuclear grade, and lymphaticinvasion. The recurrence-free survival was shorter in breast cancer patients withWnt5a expression than in those without (P = 0.024). The migratory capacity ofER-positive breast cancer cells increased with constitutive expression of Wnt5aand decreased with Wnt5a knockdown. DNA microarray analysis identified activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) as the primary gene induced by Wnt5a.ALCAM was expressed in 69% of Wnt5a-positive but only 27% of Wnt5a-negativecancers (Îº = 0.444; P < 0.001). The inhibition of ALCAM reversed the enhancedmigratory effect of Wnt5a, confirming the importance of this protein in themigration of ER-positive breast cancer cells. Wnt5a expression is related to highmalignancy and a poor prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer. We suspect thatWnt5a expression increases the malignancy of breast cancer by increasing themigratory capacity of cancer cells through the induction of ALCAM expression.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24761 PMCID: PMC5940389PMID: 29765514
