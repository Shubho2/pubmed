The pooled hazard ratios with 95% confidenceintervals (CIs) for overall survival (OS), and disease-freesurvival/recurrence-free survival (RFS)/progression-free survival (PFS) werecalculated to estimate the effects of miR-124 expression, methylation, and SNPson cancer prognosis. The Quality in Prognosis Studies and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were utilized to assess the quality of included studies.Results: A total of 20 studies involving 3,574 participants were analyzed inevidence synthesis. Our findings showed that the low expression of miR-124 wassignificantly associated with poor OS (HR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.91-2.94, P = 0.00;HR = 3.10, 95% CI: 2.04-4.70, P = 0.00) and PFS/RFS (HR = 2.21, 95% CI:1.50-3.26, P = 0.00; HR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.20-3.74, P = 0.00). Thehyper-methylation of miR-124 was associated with poor OS (HR = 2.09, 95% CI:1.48-2.95, P = 0.00) and PFS (HR = 3.70, 95% CI: 1.72-7.97, P = 0.00) (Table 3). The patients carrying with Allele C of miR-124 rs5315649 had a worse OS(HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.09-2.07, P = 0.00) and PFS (HR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.20-2.33,P = 0.00) than the carriers with Allele G.Conclusion: The low expression and hyper-methylation of miR-124 was stronglyassociated with poor prognosis, and genetic variations of miR-124 rs531564affected prognosis in cancer patients.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00252 PMCID: PMC6055006PMID: 30062087
