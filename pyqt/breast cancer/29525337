Researchers haveincreasingly focused on developing non-steroidal derivatives for their potential clinical use avoiding steroidal side-effects. Non-steroidal derivatives generallyhave planar aromatic structures attached to the azole ring system. One part ofthis ring system comprises functional groups that inhibit aromatization throughthe coordination of the haem group of the aromatase enzyme. Replacement of thetriazole ring system and development of aromatic/cyclic structures of the sidechain can increase selectivity over aromatase enzyme inhibition. In this study,4-(aryl/heteroaryl)-2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)thiazole derivatives were synthesized andphysical analyses and structural determination studies were performed. The IC50values were determined by a fluorescence-based aromatase inhibition assay andcompound 1 (4-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(pyrimidine-2-yl)thiazole) were found potentinhibitor of enzyme (IC50:0.42 nM). Then, their antiproliferative activity overMCF-7 and HEK-293 cell lines was evaluated using a3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.Compounds 1, 7, 8, 13, 15, 18, 21 were active against MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Lastly, a series of docking experiments were undertaken to analyze the crystalstructure of human placental aromatase and identify the possible interactionsbetween the most active structure and the active site.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
