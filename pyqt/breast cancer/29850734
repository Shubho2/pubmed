In this study, we synthesizedY1Rs-ligand [Pro30, Nle31, Bpa32, Leu34]NPY(28-36) (NPY)-modified andphotosensitizer MC540-loaded LiLuF4:Yb,Er@nLiGdF4@mSiO2 multifunctionalnanocomposites (MNPs) with a core-multishell structure and ultrasmall size. Theirin vitro and in vivo breast tumor targeting, trimodality imaging performance, PDTtherapeutic efficacy, and acute toxicity were evaluated. Our results demonstratedthat the core-multishell MNPs(MC540) could achieve excellent UF imaging, and thatdoping with Gd3+ and Lu3+ rare earth ions could enhance the MR and CT imagingperformance. In addition, the mSiO2 shell provided a higher loading rate for the photosensitizer MC540, and the DSPE-PEG thin layer coating outside theMNPs(MC540) further improved the water solubility and biocompatibility, reducing the acute toxicity of the nanocomposites. Finally, the NPY modification enhanced the targetability of MNPs(MC540)/DSPE-PEG-NPY to breast tumors, improving thetrimodality UF, CT, and MR imaging performance and PDT efficacy forY1-receptor-overexpressed breast cancer. In general, our developedmultifunctional nanocomposites can serve as a theranostic agent with lowtoxicity, providing great potential for their use in clinical breast cancerdiagnosis and therapy.DOI: 10.1039/c8nr02387e PMID: 29850734
