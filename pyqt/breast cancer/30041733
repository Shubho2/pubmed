Data included demographics, histopathology, RS,adjuvant therapy, locoregional (LRR) and distant recurrences (DR), and breastcancer-specific survival.RESULTS: There were 10 (5.4%) breast cancer recurrences, including one breastcancer-specific death. All 184 patients were classified by ASTRO suitabilitycriteria (suitable: 64% (5 LRR), cautionary: 30% (3 LRR), unsuitable: 6.0% (1LRR, 1 DR leading to death). RS were available in 114 estrogen receptor positive patients (<11: 22% (1 LRR), 11-25: 63% (1 LRR), 26-30: 9%, >30: 6%). Meanfollow-up was 55 months.CONCLUSIONS: ASTRO suitability criteria for APBI and RS were useful in makingprognostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients considering IORT.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
