Due to its rarity, MBC research andclinical approach are mostly based upon data derived from female breast cancer(FBC). Increasing evidence indicate that on molecular level MBC may be anheterogeneous disease different from FBC. In order to investigate whetherepigenetic signatures could define molecular subgroups of MBCs, we performedpromoter methylation analysis of genes involved in signal transduction andhormone signalling in BRCA1/2 mutation-positive and -negative MBCs. We examined69 MBCs, paired blood samples, and 15 normal tissues for promoter methylation of hTERT, ESR1, RASSF1, AR, MYC and WNT1 genes. MBCs showed higher gene promotermethylation levels compared to paired blood and normal breast samples.Significantly higher RASSF1 methylation levels were observed in association with BRCA1/2 mutations, HER2 expression and high tumor grade. Significantly higher AR methylation levels were observed in BRCA1/2 wild-type cases and higher WNT1methylation levels in PR negative cases. Overall, our results indicate thatalterations in gene methylation profiles are common in MBC and that methylationpattern of tumor-associated genes may allow for the identification of MBCmolecular subgroups, that could have implications in clinical management of MBCpatients.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24856 PMCID: PMC5929425PMID: 29731982
