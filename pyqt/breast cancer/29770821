Therefore, inhibiting cancer-relatedinflammation significantly improves cancer therapy. It has been reported thatmetformin (MET) inhibits the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a key factor in cancer-related inflammation. However, the short half-life and thelack of tumor targeting limit the anti-inflammatory efficacy of MET in vivo.Herein, using pH-sensitive imine bonds, MET and the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin(DOX) were loaded onto size-shrinkable RGD-DGL-GNP nanoparticles (RDG NPs) forcombination therapy. The RGD-MET-DGL-GNP nanoparticles (RMDG NPs) penetrated deepinto the tumor to deliver MET and inhibit the NF-κB activity in tumor cells,which further decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expressions in tumor tissues and suppressed tumor cell proliferation. As aresult, the co-administration of RGD-DOX-DGL-GNP (RDDG NPs) and RMDG NPs induced an improved therapeutic effect in a xenograft tumor model and alipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary metastasis model with murine 4T1breast cancer and CT26 colon cancer cells. Combining RDDG and RMDG NPs tosimultaneously target tumors and cancer-related inflammation is a very effective anti-cancer strategy.DOI: 10.1039/c8nr01184b PMID: 29770821
