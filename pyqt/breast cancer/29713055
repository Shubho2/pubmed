Hence, finding druggable EMT effectors is critical toefficiently interfere with metastasis formation and to overcome therapyresistance. We have employed a high-content microscopy screen in combination witha kinome and phosphatome-wide siRNA library to identify signaling pathwaysunderlying an EMT of murine mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells.This screen identified the MEK5-ERK5 axis as a critical player in TGFβ-mediatedEMT. Suppression of MEK5-ERK5 signaling completely prevented the morphologicaland molecular changes occurring during a TGFβ-induced EMT and, conversely, forcedhighly metastatic breast cancer cells into a differentiated epithelial state.Inhibition of MEK5-ERK5 signaling also repressed breast cancer cell migration andinvasion and substantially reduced lung metastasis without affecting primarytumor growth. The results suggest that the MEK5-ERK5 signaling axis viaactivation of MEF2B and other transcription factors plays an important role inthe induction and maintenance of breast cancer cell migration and invasion andthus represents an exploitable target for the pharmacological inhibition ofcancer cell metastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0270-8 PMID: 29713055
