Neoadjuvanttrastuzumab therapy improves the prognosis of certain Her‑2‑positive breastcancer patients, however around two‑thirds of patients with Her‑2‑positive breastcancer do not benefit from Her‑2‑targeted therapy. To investigate the keymechanisms in trastuzumab resistance, potential biomarkers for neoadjuvanttrastuzumab sensitivity were investigated using the gene expression omnibus (GEO)database for mRNA microarray data of Her‑2‑positive breast cancer patients whoreceived neoadjuvant trastuzumab therapy. GEO profiles of 22 patients with acomplete response and 48 patients with a partial response were identified in the GSE22358, GSE62327 and GSE66305 datasets. A total of 2,376, 1,000 and 1,152differentially expressed genes in GSE22358, GSE62327 and GSE66305 datasets weredemonstrated, respectively, utilizing GEO2R software. Furthermore, enriched gene ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were analyzedusing the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discoverysoftware. Subsequently, a protein‑protein interaction network was establishedusing STRING software. The results demonstrated that low sex‑determining regionY‑box 11 and high Bcl‑2 expression may be employed as markers for neoadjuvanttrastuzumab therapy for Her‑2‑positive breast cancer. More importantly,phosphoinositide 3‑kinase/Akt and angiogenesis pathways, which are known to bethe key targets of trastuzumab, were activated at a lower level in the partialresponse patients, while the Wnt and estrogen receptor signaling pathways wereactivated in these patients. Therefore, combination therapy of trastuzumab andanti‑Wnt or hormone therapy may be a promising treatment modality and should betested in further studies.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8981 PMCID: PMC6059662PMID: 29750305
