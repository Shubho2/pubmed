These diverse roles of Ets-1 are likely to depend on its interaction proteins. We have previously showed that Ets-1 interacted withDNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex including its regulatory subunits, Ku70 and Ku86 and with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). In this study,the binding domains for the interaction between Ets-1 and these proteins werereported. We demonstrated that the interaction of Ets-1 with DNA-PK was mediated through the Ku70 subunit and was mapped to the C-terminal region of Ets-1 and theC-terminal part of Ku70 including SAP domain. The interactive domains betweenEts-1 and PARP-1 have been mapped to the C-terminal region of Ets-1 and the BRCA1carboxy-terminal (BRCT) domain of PARP-1. The results presented in this study mayadvance our understanding of the functional link between Ets-1 and itsinteraction partners, DNA-PK and PARP-1.DOI: 10.1080/09168451.2018.1484276 PMID: 29912634
