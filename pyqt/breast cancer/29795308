To evaluate this further, weconducted parallel, prospective, first-in-human studies of DS-7423, a dualPI3K/mTOR inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumours in the US and Japan.We pooled and compared the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD),toxicity, and efficacy between these populations.RESULTS: 17 MTA were approved in NA/EU and Asia from 2001 to 2015. Recommendedphase 2 doses (RP2D) were identical across races in 14 of 17 (80%) studies anddifferences were not clinically meaningful. FAD were identical across allregions. 42 and 27 patients from US and Japan, respectively, were enrolled in thephase I studies of DS-7423. Despite differences in race, body weight, and bodymass index, the RP2D were 240â€‰mg/day with no differences in toxicities, PK, PD,or efficacy.CONCLUSIONS: Conducting separate clinical trials of single-agent MTA in Caucasianand Asian populations may be redundant.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0102-1 PMID: 29795308
