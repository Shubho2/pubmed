Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs thatreside in the PVT1 locus are the main driver of the oncogenic roles of PVT1 incancer. However, the oncogenic role and underlying mechanism of miR-1204, locatedin the PVT1 locus, in human cancer is still unclear. In this study, we discoveredthat increased expression of miR-1204 is associated with poor prognosis in BC.Moreover, miR-1204 promotes proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion of BC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigationsdemonstrated that VDR is a novel target gene of miR-1204. Interference of VDRrestored miR-1204-mediated BC cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. Collectively, our results demonstrated that the miR-1204-VDR pathway exertsoncogenic effects in BC with potential therapeutic applications in blocking BCdevelopment and progression.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0215-2 PMID: 29555976
