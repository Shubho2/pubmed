However, the role of cellular Rac1-interacting proteins in thetransforming potential of Rac1P29S remains unclear. We found that the catalyticdomain of DOCK1, a Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)implicated in malignancy of a variety of cancers, can greatly accelerate theGDP/GTP exchange of Rac1P29S. Enforced expression of Rac1P29S induced matrixinvasion and macropinocytosis in wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts(MEFs), but not in DOCK1-deficient MEFs. Consistently, a selective inhibitor ofDOCK1 that blocks its GEF function suppressed the invasion and macropinocytosisin WT MEFs expressing Rac1P29S. Human melanoma IGR-1 and breast cancerMDA-MB-157 cells harbor Rac1P29S mutation and express DOCK1 endogenously. Geneticinactivation and pharmacological inhibition of DOCK1 suppressed their invasionand macropinocytosis. Taken together, these results indicate that DOCK1 is acritical regulator of the malignant phenotypes induced by Rac1P29S, and suggestthat targeting DOCK1 might be an effective approach to treat cancers associatedwith Rac1P29S mutation.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
