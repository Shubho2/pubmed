Follow-up data and a control group from thegeneral population were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Aftercorrection for age and calendar year at time of diagnosis, standardised incidenceratios (SIR) for the first three years after VPD diagnosis were estimated with95% confidence intervals (95%CI).RESULTS: We identified 199 patients with a first diagnosis of VPD (164non-invasive, 35 (micro-)invasive) between 2000 and 2015. The SIR of developingan associated malignancy in the first 3 years after diagnosis was 4.67 (95%CI2.66-7.64). This was mainly due to the high incidence of intestinal malignancies among patients with secondary VPD. Subgroup analysis for cutaneous non-invasiveVPD did not reveal a significantly increased risk for associated malignanciesi.e., SIR 2.08 (95%CI 0.76-4.62).CONCLUSION: Of patients with VPD, 76.9% is diagnosed with cutaneous non-invasive VPD, and this group has no increased risk for developing malignancies of thebreast, intestinal or urological tract. Our study suggests that routine screeningfor these malignancies in patients diagnosed with cutaneous non-invasive VPD may not be necessary. This article is protected by copyright.
