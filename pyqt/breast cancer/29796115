Western blot and immunochemistry were used to examine the expressionof DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) protein inÂ breast cancer cells and tissues. The functional roles of miR-29c in breast cancer cells such as proliferation,migration, invasion, colony formation, and 3D growth were evaluated using MTT,transwell chambers, soft agar, and 3D Matrigel culture, respectively. Inaddition, the luciferase reporter assay was used to check if miR-29c binds the3'UTR of DNMT3B. The effects of miR-29c on the DNMT3B/TIMP3/STAT1/FOXO1 pathwaywere also examined using Western blot and methyl-specific qPCR. The specificinhibitor of STAT1, fludarabine, was used to further check the mechanism ofmiR-29c function in breast cancer cells. Studies on cell functions were carriedout in DNMT3B siRNA cell lines.Results: The expression of miR-29c was decreased with the progression of breastcancers and was closely associated with an overall survival rate of patients.Overexpression of miR-29c inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion,colony formation, and growth in 3D Matrigel while knockdown of miR-29c promotedthese processes in breast cancer cells. In addition, miR-29c was found to bind3'UTR of DNMT3B and inhibits the expression of DNMT3B, which was elevated inbreast cancers. Moreover, the protein level of TIMP3 was reduced whereasmethylation of TIMP3 was increased in miR-29c knockdown cells compared tocontrol. On the contrary, the protein level of TIMP3 was increased whereasmethylation of TIMP3 was reduced in miR-29c-overexpressing cells compared tocontrol. Knockdown of DNMT3B reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasionof breast cancer cell lines. Finally, our results showed that miR-29c exerted itsfunction in breast cancers by regulating the TIMP3/STAT1/FOXO1 pathway.Conclusion: The results suggest that miR-29c plays a significant role insuppressing the progression of breast cancers and that miR-29c may be used as abiomarker of breast cancers.DOI: 10.1186/s13148-018-0495-y PMCID: PMC5956756PMID: 29796115
