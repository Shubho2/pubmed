Our aim was toinvestigate whether the Ki-67 proliferation index in fine needle aspirationmaterial can contribute to the diagnosis of FTC.METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively cytological Ki-67 index determined inroutine clinical setting and clinical data for 61 patients with FTC, 158 patientswith FTA and 15 patients with follicular tumor of uncertain malignant potential(FT-UMP) surgically treated and diagnosed by histopathology at KarolinskaUniversity Hospital 2006-2017 (Cohort A). A previously published cohort of 109patients with follicular tumors was re-analyzed as well (Cohort B).RESULTS: In Cohort A, patients with FTC had a higher Ki-67 index (p < 0.001),larger tumor size (p < 0.001) and higher age at diagnosis (p = 0.036) compared topatients with FTA or FT-UMP. Hürthle cell differentiation, present in 50 FTA, 20 FTC and 8 FT-UMP, was associated with higher Ki-67 index (p = 0.009).Multivariate analysis of Cohort A identified a high Ki-67 index (odds ratio [OR]:1.215, p < 0.001) and large tumor size (OR: 1.038, p < 0.001) as independentpredictors of FTC. Results remained consistent after exclusion of Hürthle celltumors and in pooled analysis of Cohort A + B. The area under curve of the Ki-67 index for predicting FTC was 0.722 and a cut-off for Ki-67 index at above 5%resulted in a specificity at 93% and sensitivity at 31%. Subgroup analysis ofFTCs in Cohort A showed an association of higher Ki-67 index to extrathyroidalextension (p = 0.001) as well as widely invasive subtype (p = 0.019) based on theWHO 2017 classification.CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative Ki-67 index may add diagnostic information for asubset of patients with follicular thyroid tumors.DOI: 10.1007/s12020-018-1627-z PMCID: PMC6061212PMID: 29796987
