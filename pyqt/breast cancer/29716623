Among severaldysregulated miRNAs in human cancer, the up-regulation of miR-221 has beenassociated with development of a variety of hematologic and solid malignancies.In this study, we investigated the involvement of miR-221 in breast cancer.METHODS: TaqMan microRNA assay was used to detect the miR-221 levels in normalcells and in MDA-MB 231 and SkBr3 breast cancer cells as well as in main players of the tumor microenvironment, namely cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).miR-221 mimic sequence and locked nucleic acid (LNA)-i-miR-221 construct wereused to induce or inhibit, respectively, the miR-221 expression in cells used.Quantitative PCR and western blotting analysis were performed to evaluate thelevels of the miR-221 target gene A20 (TNFAIP3), as well as the member of theNF-kB complex namely c-Rel and the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF).Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed to ascertain therecruitment of c-Rel to the CTFG promoter. Finally, the cell growth and migrationin the presence of LNA-i-miR-221 or silencing c-Rel and CTGF by specific shorthairpin were assessed by cell count, colony formation and boyden chambers assays.Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA.RESULTS: We first demonstrated that LNA-i-miR-221 inhibits both endogenous andectopic expression of miR-221 in our experimental models. Next, we found that theA20 down-regulation, as well as the up-regulation of c-Rel induced by miR-221were no longer evident using LNA-i-miR-221. Moreover, we established that themiR-221 dependent recruitment of c-Rel to the NF-kB binding site located withinthe CTGF promoter region is prevented by using LNA-i-miR-221. Furthermore, wedetermined that the up-regulation of CTGF mRNA and protein levels by miR-221 isno longer evident using LNA-i-miR221 and silencing c-Rel. Finally, we assessedthat cell growth and migration induced by miR-221 in MDA-MB 231 and SkBr3 breast cancer cells as well as in CAFs are abolished by LNAi-miR-221 and silencing c-Relor CTGF.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these data provide novel insights into the stimulatoryaction of miR-221 in breast cancer cells and CAFs, suggesting that its inhibitionmay be considered toward targeted therapeutic approaches in breast cancerpatients.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0767-6 PMCID: PMC5930435PMID: 29716623
