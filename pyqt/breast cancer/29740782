QoL-related functions and symptoms (EORTCQLQ-C30/-BR23), health problems, and support needs were assessed. EORTC-QLQscores were compared with age-matched normative values from the generalpopulation in Germany.RESULTS: QoL-related functions and symptoms in patients during cancer treatmentwere worse compared to healthy references, but largely improved over time. Yet,cognitive function and sleep were still significantly impaired at 5-yearfollow-up. Other common long-term problems included sexual issues (45% ofsurvivors), hot flashes (38%), pain (34%), fatigue (24%), and polyneuropathy(21%). Regression analyses indicated fatigue having the strongest impact onglobal QoL. Support needs were expressed mainly for menopausal disorders (43%),physical performance (39%), sleep problems (38%), arthralgia (37%), cognitiveproblems (36%), weight problems (32%), and fatigue (31%).CONCLUSIONS: While QoL in disease-free breast cancer survivors 5 yearspost-diagnosis was largely comparable to the general population on average, stillmany survivors suffered from adverse effects. There appears to be a need forongoing screening and support regarding fatigue, sleep problems, cognitiveproblems, arthralgia/pain, menopausal/sexual symptoms, physical performance, and weight problems during and several years following breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s11136-018-1866-8 PMID: 29740782
