Usingstructural information from known KDM4 and KDM5 inhibitors, a potent series ofpyrazolylpyridines was designed. Structure-activity relationship (SAR)exploration resulted in the identification of compound 33, an orally available,potent inhibitor of KDM5A/5B with promising selectivity. Potent cellularinhibition as measured by levels of tri-methylated H3K4 was demonstrated withcompound 33 in the breast cancer cell line ZR-75-1.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
