[Epub ahead of print]The Impact of ESR1 Mutations on the Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer.Pejerrey SM(1), Dustin D(1), Kim JA(1), Gu G(1), Rechoum Y(1), Fuqua SAW(2).Author information: (1)Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, Baylor College of Medicine, One BaylorPlaza, MS: 600, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.(2)Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, Baylor College of Medicine, One BaylorPlaza, MS: 600, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. sfuqua@bcm.edu.After nearly 20Â years of research, it is now established that mutations withinthe estrogen receptor (ER) gene, ESR1, frequently occur in metastatic breastcancer and influence response to hormone therapy. Though early studies presented differing results, sensitive sequencing techniques now show that ESR1 mutationsoccur at a frequency between 20 and 40% depending on the assay method. Recentstudies have focused on several "hot spot mutations," a cluster of mutationsfound in the hormone-binding domain of the ESR1 gene. Throughout the course oftreatment, tumor evolution can occur, and ESR1 mutations emerge and becomeenriched in the metastatic setting. Sensitive techniques to continually monitormutant burden in vivo are needed to effectively treat patients with mutant ESR1. The full impact of these mutations on tumor response to different therapiesremains to be determined. However, recent studies indicate that mutant-bearingtumors may be less responsive to specific hormonal therapies, and suggest thataromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy may select for the emergence of ESR1 mutations. Additionally, different mutations may respond discretely to targeted therapies.The need for more preclinical mechanistic studies on ESR1 mutations and thedevelopment of better agents to target these mutations are urgently needed. Inthe future, sequential monitoring of ESR1 mutational status will likely directpersonalized therapeutic regimens appropriate to each tumor's unique mutationallandscape.DOI: 10.1007/s12672-017-0306-5 PMID: 29736566
