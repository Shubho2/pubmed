We investigated whether executioner caspase activation downstream of mitochondrial apoptosis was associated with, or independent, ofBCL2's prognostic signature in breast cancer. Levels of pro- and anti-apoptoticBCL2 family proteins were quantified in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)samples and utilised to calculate BCL2 profiles of 845 breast cancer patients.Biomarkers including single apoptosis proteins and network-enriched apoptosissystem signatures were evaluated using uni- and multi-variate Cox-models. In bothTNBC and non-TNBC breast cancer, the anti-apoptotic BCL2 protein was particularlyabundant when compared to other solid tumours. High BCL2 protein levels wereprognostic of favourable outcome across all breast cancers (HR 0.4, 95% CI0.2-0.6, Wald p < 0.0001). Although BCL2 and cleaved caspase-7 levels werenegatively correlated, levels of cleaved caspase-7 were also associated withfavourable outcome (HR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.7, Wald p = 0.001). A combination of lowBCL2 and low cleaved caspase-7 protein levels was highly prognostic ofunfavourable outcome across all breast cancers (HR 11.29, 95% CI 2.20-58.23, Waldp = 0.01). A combination of BCL2 and cleaved caspase-7 levels is a promisingprognostic biomarker in breast cancer patients.KEY MESSAGE: BCL2 levels areelevated in breast cancer where they are marker of good prognosis. BCL2 andactive caspase levels correlate negatively; yet, active caspases indicate goodoutcome. Low BCL2 and low caspase-7 are highly prognostic of unfavourable outcomeacross all breast cancers. BCL2 levels indicate molecular subtype and tumourproliferation status in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s00109-018-1675-0 PMID: 30069746
