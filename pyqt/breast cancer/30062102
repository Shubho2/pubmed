Targeted sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from primary tumor specimens of 63 premenopausalAsian patients who relapsed after initial diagnosis of non-metastatic breastcancer. The most prevalent alterations included: TP53 (65%); PIK3CA (32%); GATA3 (29%); ERBB2 (27%); MYC (25%); KMT2C (21%); MCL1 (17%); PRKDC, TPR, BRIP1 (14%); MDM4, PCDH15, PRKAR1A, CDKN1B (13%); CCND1, KMT2D, STK11, and MLH1 (11%). Sixtyof the 63 patients (95%) had at least one genetic alteration in a signalingpathway related to cell cycle or p53 signaling. The presence of MCL1amplification, HIF-1-alpha transcription factor network pathway alterations, and direct p53 effectors pathway alterations were independent predictors of inferior overall survival from initial diagnosis. Comparison with non-Asian premenopausal tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed a higher prevalence of TP53mutations among HER2-positive cancers, and more frequent TP53, TET2, and CDK12mutations among hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative cancers in our cohort.Given the limited number of non-Asian premenopausal breast cancers that hadrelapsed in TCGA, we compared the frequency of mutations in our cohort with 43premenopausal specimens from both TCGA and International Cancer Genome Consortiumthat had relapsed. There was a trend toward higher prevalence of TP53 mutationsin our cohort. Certain genomic aberrations may be enriched in tumors ofpoor-prognosis premenopausal Asian breast cancers. The development of noveltherapies targeting these aberrations merit further research.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0070-x PMCID: PMC6062514PMID: 30062102
