Overallsurvival was partitioned into time without progression/Grade ≥ 3 adverse events(AEs) toxicity (TWiST), time with Grade ≥ 3 AE toxicity (TOX), and time afterrelapse (REL). Q-TWiST was calculated by multiplying mean time in each healthstate by its assigned utility (base-case utility values: time without symptoms ofdisease progression or toxicity of Grade ≥ 3 adverse events [TWiST] = 1.0, TOX = 0.5, and REL = 0.5). In threshold analyses, TOX and REL varied from 0.0 to 1.0whereas TWiST was maintained at 1.0. Comparisons were made for theintent-to-treat population and the subset of patients initiating the study drugs as second or subsequent lines (2L+) of chemotherapy (per approved nab-Pindication; 2L+ subpopulation). A ≥ 15% relative Q-TWiST gain (vs. mean Pacoverall survival) was considered clearly clinically important.RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat population, nab-P (n = 229) versus Pac (n = 225) resulted in nonsignificant gains of 1.4 months of mean Q-TWiST (11.6 vs. 10.2months; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.03 to 2.8). In the 2L+ subpopulation,nab-P (n = 132) versus Pac (n = 136) resulted in a statistically significant gainof 2.2 months of mean Q-TWiST (10.5 vs. 8.4 months; 95% CI, 0.6-3.8), with a17.1% relative Q-TWiST gain (threshold analysis range, 14.0%-19.5%, both figures significant).CONCLUSION: In its approved indication for metastatic breast cancer, nab-P showeda statistically significant and clearly clinically important improvement inquality-adjusted survival time versus Pac in the 2L+ subpopulation.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
