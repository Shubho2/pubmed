ZFX is widely expressed inpluripotent stem cells and is down-regulated during differentiation of embryonic stem cells. ZFX has five different variants that encode three different proteinisoforms. While several reports have determined the overexpression of ZFX in avariety of somatic cancers, the expression of ZFX-spliced variants in cancercells is not well-understood.Methods: We investigated the expression of ZFX variants in a series of breastcancer tissues and cell lines using quantitative PCR.Results: The expression of ZFX variant 1/3 was higher in tumor tissue compared tomarginal tissue. In contrast, the ZFX variant 5 was down-regulated in tumortissues. While the ZFX variant 1/3 and ZFX variant 5 expression significantlyincreased in low-grade tumors, ZFX variant 4 was strongly expressed in high-gradetumors and demonstrating lymphatic invasion. In addition, our result revealed asignificant association between the HER2 status and the expression of ZFX-splicedvariants.Conclusion: Our data suggest that the expression of ZFX-spliced transcriptsvaries between different types of breast cancer and may contribute to theirtumorigenesis process. Hence, ZFX-spliced transcripts could be considered asnovel tumor markers with a probable value in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy ofbreast cancer.PMID: 29753316
