In thisstudy, a selective and sensitive method was developed for the simultaneousdetermination of all the 7 thiols occurring in the transsulfuration pathway(Cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcys), glutathione (GSH), N-acetylcysteine (Nac), cysteinylglycine (CysGly), glutamylcysteine (GluCys) and cysteamine (CA)) inhuman serum by in-vitro stable isotope labeling - dispersive solid phaseextraction - liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry analysis(IL-DSPE-LC-MS/MS). In the proposed method, a pair of stable isotope-labelingreagents, BQB (ω-bromoacetonylquinolinium bromide) and BQB-D7, were utilized tolabel thiols in human serum samples and thiol standards, respectively. The BQBlabeled thiols which carry a positive charge were extracted and purified withC8-SO3H-based DSPE followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. Good linearities for 7 thiolsoccurring in the transsulfuration pathway were obtained with the coefficient ofdetermination (R2) >0.9901. The limits of detection (LODs) were in the range of0.7-6.0 nmol/L. The method was further applied to investigate the contents changeof 7 thiols in human serum samples of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patientsand breast cancer (BC) patients. The results showed that the contents of thesethiols occurring in the transsulfuration pathway significantly changed and werehighly diseases-related. In addition, partial least squares discriminant analysis(PLS-DA) suggested excellent classification performance between patients andhealthy controls. The findings indicated that these significantly changed thiols occurring in the transsulfuration pathway in T2DM patients and BC patients might serve as the indicator for the diagnosis of T2DM and BC. Taken together, thedeveloped IL-DSPE-LC-MS/MS method provides a promising tool for the sensitiveanalysis of thiols from complex biological samples, which may promote thein-depth investigation of the functions of thiols.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
