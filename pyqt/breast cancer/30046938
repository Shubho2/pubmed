The improved prognosis is only partly explained by stage migration. The distribution of themolecular subtypes of screen-detected breast cancer (SDBC) or their HER2 statushas not been studied extensively. We wished to address these issues through thestudy of a large series of SDBC, with other presentations serving as controls.DESIGN: Deidentified cases of female invasive cancer, diagnosed in Australia and New Zealand during 2005-2015, were retrieved from the BreastSurgANZ Quality Audit(BQA). Method of detection and selected patient, tumour and treatment data wereassessed. Immunohistochemical surrogates for molecular subtypes were defined asLuminal A (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2-), Luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+),HER2-enriched (ER-, PR- and HER2+) and basal-like (triple negative). Results werecompared with the findings of controls and previous studies.RESULT: 100983 invasive cancers were diagnosed, including 32493 (32.7%) SDBC and 66907 (67.3%) with other presentations. The biomarker profile for SDBC versusother presentations in the same population was ER 89.3 versus 80.3%, PR 78.8versus 69.8% and for HER2 11 versus 15.6%. The distribution of molecular subtypeswas Luminal A 81.9 versus 70.74%, Luminal B 7.39 versus 9.52%, HER2-enriched 3.63versus 6.06% and Basal-like 7.08 versus 13.68%. These differences weresignificant (p < 0.0001).CONCLUSION: Molecular profiles of SDBC are significantly different from those of symptomatic cancers, with over-representation of the Luminal A andproportionately lower rates of all other subtypes. We have shown, for the firsttime, significantly lower rates of HER2 positivity in SDBC. These differences maycontribute to the better survival of SDBC and have implications forprognostication, targeted therapy decisions and for laboratory quality assurance programs in setting target ranges for proportions of ER-positive and HER2 resultsin heavily screened populations.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4899-3 PMID: 30046938
