Univariable and multivariableanalyses of factors predicting the development of on-treatment cardiac adverseevents were conducted through logistic regression analysis. The following factorswere evaluated in the univariable analysis: age, menopausal status, body massindex, T stage, and type of chemotherapy protocol.RESULTS: Among the studied patients, 226 patients (6.7%) experienced 230incidents of on-treatment cardiac toxicities. Cardiac ischemia was reported among8 patients, cardiac dysfunction was reported among 19 patients, arrhythmias were reported in 161 patients and other non-specified forms of cardiac adverse events were reported in 42 patients. In univariable logistic regression, the followingparameters were predictive of a higher probability of on-treatment cardiacadverse events (P < 0.05): higher age, higher body mass index and FACchemotherapy protocol. When these factors were included in the multivariablelogistic regression analysis, the following factors were predictive of a higherprobability of cardiac adverse events: higher body mass index (P = 0.050) and FACchemotherapy protocol (P = 0.001).CONCLUSION: On-treatment cardiac events are not uncommon during adjuvantchemotherapy for early breast cancer. Higher dose of anthracyclines and higherbody mass index are associated with a higher risk of on-treatment cardiac events.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0878-0 PMID: 29882200
