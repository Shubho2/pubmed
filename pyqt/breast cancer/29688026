Electronic patient records of iPE patients were reviewed fordemographic and treatment information.RESULTS: 26 iPEs were reported in 1,604 scans (731 patients), incidence 1.6%;female = 15; median age = 66 (range 32-90); main artery = 10; lobar artery = 8;segmental = 7; subsegmental = 1; median time (range) from scan to reporting =1 day (0-60); scan to anticoagulation = 5 days (0-61) (three had no treatment);scan to death = 7 months (1-22+) with nine still alive and two lost to follow up.All had metastatic disease. There was no sudden death. None of the patients whoseanticoagulation started more than 5 days after the iPE CT scan died within 3months. iPE was absent in all repeat staging CT scans (done average 3.4 monthsafter the anticoagulation) in 16 patients, without any anticoagulation in onepatient with segmental iPE.CONCLUSION: Incidence of iPE in patients with current macroscopic malignancy islow-1.6%-mostly seen in lung, breast and colorectal cancer probably due tofrequency of imaging. A few days' delay in anticoagulation does not appear tohave an impact on the risk of sudden cardiac death. Advances in knowledge: Thisstudy tells us that iPE is infrequent, that it can be treated appropriately with anticoagulation, but this does not necessarily need to begin on the same day ofdiagnosis.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170806 PMID: 29688026  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
