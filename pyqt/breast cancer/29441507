For hormone-dependent BC,endocrine therapies varying in efficacy and price are available. The aim of this study is to assess the cost effectiveness of fulvestrant 500 mg as a second-line hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positivemetastatic or locally advanced BC versus letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestanein Sweden.METHODS: A three-state (pre-progression, post-progression, and death)partitioned-survival model was used to estimate progression-free (PFS) andoverall survival (OS) by extrapolating trial results beyond the trial period tocapture costs and benefits over a lifetime perspective. The comparativeeffectiveness was sourced from a network meta-analysis. The evaluation wasconducted from a Swedish national payer perspective; costs, resource use, andquality of life were based on published sources and expert opinion.RESULTS: Compared to anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane the incrementalcost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were €33,808, €33,883, and €49,225 per QALYwith incremental costs of €13,283, €14,986, and €13,862, and incremental QALYs of0.393, 0.442, and 0.282, respectively. Incremental cost per life-year (LY) gained€21,312 (incremental LY of 0.623), €20,338 (incremental LY of 0.737), and €27,854(incremental LY of 0.498) for respective comparators. Applying the upper andlower credible intervals for PFS/OS from the meta-analysis had the greatesteffect on the ICER in the sensitivity analysis. The results were relativelystable when varying other parameters.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that fulvestrant 500 mg may be a cost-effectivealternative to aromatase inhibitors at a threshold of €100,000/QALY.DOI: 10.1007/s41669-017-0031-6 PMCID: PMC5711749PMID: 29441507
