However, the role of FENDRR in breast cancerremains unknown.Materials and methods: We detected the expression of FENDRR in 52 breast cancerpatients' tissues and five breast cancer cell lines. The association betweenFENDRR expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis of breast cancerpatients was also analyzed. Moreover, cell proliferation assays, flow cytometryanalysis, wound-healing assays, and transwell migration assays were performed to detect the biological effects of FENDRR in the breast cancer cells. A xenograftmodel was used to explore the role of FENDRR expression on tumor growth.Results: We found that FENDRR expression was lower in breast cancer cell linesand cancerous tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues. Low expression ofFENDRR was associated with a shorter overall survival and a shorterprogression-free survival in breast cancer patients (p<0.001, p<0.001,respectively). We found that FENDRR inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation andmigration and promotes cell apoptosis, while FENDRR knockdown promotes breastcancer cell proliferation and migration and suppresses cell apoptosis. Finally,we also detected that FENDRR overexpression could inhibit tumor growth in axenograft model.Conclusion: Our data suggested that FENDRR inhibits breast cancer cellproliferation, promotes cell apoptosis, and is associated with good prognosis in breast cancer. Thus, FENDRR plays an important role in the growth and progressionof breast cancer.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S149511 PMCID: PMC5857152PMID: 29559798
