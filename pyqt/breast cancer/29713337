The role of integrins, adhesion receptors thatconnect cells to the extracellular matrix, in MMP expression and activity hasbeen previously suggested. However, the mechanisms by which integrins control MMPexpression are not completely understood. Particularly, the role of α2β1integrin, one of the major collagen I receptors, in MMP activity and expressionhas not been studied. Alternagin-C (ALT-C), aglutamate-cysteine-aspartate-disintegrin from Bothrops alternatus venom, has highaffinity for an α2β1 integrin. Herein, we used ALT-C as a α2β1 integrin ligand tostudy the effect of ALT-C on MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression as well as on tumorcells, fibroblats and endothelial cell migration.Methods: ALT-C was purified by two steps of gel filtration followed by anionexchange chromatography. The α2β1 integrin binding properties of ALT-C, itsdissociation constant (Kd ) relative to this integrin and to collagen I (Col I)were determined by surface plasmon resonance. The effects of ALT-C (10, 40, 100and 1000 nM) in migration assays were studied using three human cell lines: humanfibroblasts, breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-231, and microvascular endothelialcells HMEC-1, considering cells found in the tumor microenvironment. ALT-Ceffects on MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression and activity were analyzed by quantitative PCR and gelatin zymography, respectively. Focal adhesion kinase activation wasdetermined by western blotting.Results: Our data demonstrate that ALT-C, after binding to α2β1 integrin, acts bytwo distinct mechanisms against tumor progression, depending on the cell type: intumor cells, ALT-C decreases MMP-9 and MMP-2 contents and activity, but increasesfocal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and transmigration; and in endothelialcells, ALT-C inhibits MMP-2, which is necessary for tumor angiogenesis. ALT-Calso upregulates c-Myc mRNA level, which is related to tumor suppression.Conclusion: These results demonstrate that α2β1 integrin controls MMP expression and reveal this integrin as a target for the development of antiangiogenic andantimetastatic therapies.DOI: 10.1186/s40409-018-0150-2 PMCID: PMC5917863PMID: 29713337
