Herein, we report a facile andversatile method to synthesize AB2 miktoarm block copolymers bearing a singletoxygen (1O2)-labile regio and stereospecific β-aminoacrylate linkage with 100%E-configuration at the junction via a combination of amino-yne click chemistryand ring opening polymerization. Using this strategy, a series of 1O2-responsive AB2 amphiphilic miktoarm (MA) copolymers composed of hydrophilic polyethyleneglycol (PEG) as the A constituent and hydrophobic polycaprolactone (PCL) as the Bconstituent (MA-PEG- b-PCL2) was synthesized by varying the block length of PCL. The self-assembly characteristics of these well-defined MA-PEG- b-PCL2 copolymersin an aqueous condition were studied by solvent displacement and thin-filmhydration method, and their morphologies were investigated using transmissionelectron microscopy. The copolymers formed spherical, cylindrical, or lamellamorphologies, depending on the chain length and preparation conditions. Ahydrophobic photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and anticancer drug doxorubicin(DOX) were efficiently encapsulated into the hydrophobic core of MA-PEG- b-PCL2copolymer micelles. These coloaded micelles were taken up by human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells. Upon red laser light irradiation, the 1O2-generated by theCe6 induced photocleavage of the β-aminoacrylate moiety, leading to thedissociation of the micellar structure and triggered intracellular drug releasefor effective therapy. Overall, rapid disassembly upon 1O2 generation andsubsequent controlled intracellular drug release suggested that these micellesbearing β-aminoacrylate linkage have a huge potential for on-demand drugdelivery.DOI: 10.1021/acs.biomac.8b00290 PMID: 29690765
