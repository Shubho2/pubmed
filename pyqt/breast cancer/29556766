Marga.Rominger@usz.ch.OBJECTIVES: To assess feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of a novel hand-heldultrasound (US) method for breast density assessment that measures the speed ofsound (SoS), in comparison to the ACR mammographic (MG) categories.METHODS: ACR-MG density (a=fatty to d=extremely dense) and SoS-US were assessedin the retromamillary, inner and outer segments of 106 women by tworadiographers. A conventional US system was used for SoS-US. A reflector servedas timing reference for US signals transmitted through the breasts. Four blinded readers assessed average SoS (m/s), ΔSoS (segment-variation SoS; m/s) and theACR-MG density. The highest SoS and ΔSoS values of the three segments were usedfor MG-ACR whole breast comparison.RESULTS: SoS-US breasts were examined in <2 min. Mean SoS values of densities a-dwere 1,421 m/s (SD 14), 1,432 m/s (SD 17), 1,448 m/s (SD 20) and 1,500 m/s (SD31), with significant differences between all groups (p<0.001). The SoS-UScomfort scores and inter-reader agreement were significantly better than thosefor MG (1.05 vs. 2.05 and 0.982 vs. 0.774; respectively). A strong segmentcorrelation between SoS and ACR-MG breast density was evident (rs=0.622,p=<0.001) and increased for full breast classification (rs=0.746, p=<0.001).SoS-US allowed diagnosis of dense breasts (ACR c and d) with sensitivity 86.2 %, specificity 85.2 % and AUC 0.887.CONCLUSIONS: Using hand-held SoS-US, radiographers measured breast densitywithout discomfort, readers evaluated measurements with high inter-readeragreement, and SoS-US correlated significantly with ACR-MG breast-densitycategories.KEY POINTS: • The novel speed-of-sound ultrasound correlated significantly withmammographic ACR breast density categories. • Radiographers measured breastdensity without women discomfort or radiation. • SoS-US can be implemented on astandard US machine. • SoS-US shows potential for a quantifiable, cost-effective assessment of breast density.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-017-5287-9 PMID: 29556766
