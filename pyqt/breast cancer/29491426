In ~15% of breast cancers, theepidermal growth factor receptor HER2, a transmembrane protein, is overexpressed.This HER2 overexpression is associated with an aggressive form of the disease anda poor clinical prognosis. The extracellular domain (ECD) of HER2 is releasedinto the blood by a proteolytic mechanism known as "ECD shedding". Thisproteolytic shedding leaves a constitutively active truncated receptor in themembrane that is 10-100-fold more oncogenic than the full-length receptor andpromotes the growth and survival of cancer cells. Shedding of the HER2 ECD isincreased during metastasis: whereas 15% of primary breast cancer patients haveelevated levels of serum HER2 ECD (sHER2 ECD), the levels reach 45% in patientswith metastatic disease. Thus, sHER2 ECD has been proposed as a promisingbiomarker for cancer recurrence and for monitoring the disease status of patientsoverexpressing HER2. Nevertheless, in 2016, the American Society of ClinicalOncology advises clinicians not to use soluble HER2 levels to guide their choice of adjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, because theevidence was considered not strong enough. Currently, biomarkers such ascarcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 15-3 are widely used to monitormetastatic breast cancer disease even if the level of evidence of clinical impactof this monitoring is poor. In this article, we review the evidence that sHER2ECD might be used in some situations as a biomarker for breast cancer. Althoughthis serum biomarker will not replace the direct measurement of tumor HER2 statusfor diagnosis of early-stage tumors; it might be especially useful in metastatic disease for prognosis, as an indicator of cancer progression and of therapyresponse, particularly to anti-HER2 therapies. Owing to these data, sHER2 ECDshould be considered as a promising biomarker to detect cancer recurrence andmetastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41374-018-0033-8 PMID: 29491426
