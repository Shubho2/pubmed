We aimed to assess theeffectiveness of various first-line endocrine monotherapies or combinations todetermine the optimal sequence in a network meta-analysis.Materials and methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library forrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception up to November 21, 2017. Weincluded only RCTs that assessed the effectiveness of the following treatments asa monotherapy or in combination as the first-line treatment: tamoxifen,anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant, palbociclib, and ribociclib. Theresults were presented with pooled odds ratio or hazard ratio (HR), and 95%credible interval (CrI). The primary outcomes were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival/time to progression.Results: A total of 16 eligible articles (14 RCTs) involving 6,602 patientstreated with 10 different first-line endocrine therapies were assessed in ournetwork meta-analysis. Palbociclib plus letrozole was superior to anastrozole,letrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant 500 mg, and anastrozole plus fulvestrant(loading dose) (HR=0.44, 95% CrI: 0.33-0.58; HR=0.56, 95% CrI: 0.45-0.68;HR=0.45, 95% CrI: 0.32-0.61; HR=0.58, 95% CrI: 0.42-0.81; HR=0.50, 95% CrI:0.37-0.68; respectively). However, there is no significant advantage comparedwith ribociclib plus letrozole (HR=1.00, 95% CrI: 0.72-1.39). In terms of ORR,ribociclib plus letrozole is more effective than palbociclib plus letrozole (oddsratio=1.30, 95% CrI: 0.83-2.02).Conclusion: Palbociclib plus letrozole and ribociclib plus letrozole might be theoptimal first-line endocrine therapeutic choices for hormonereceptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advancedbreast cancer due to a longer progression-free survival/time to progression and amore efficacious ORR.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S165681 PMCID: PMC5951224PMID: 29780257
