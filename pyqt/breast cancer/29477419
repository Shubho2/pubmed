A total of 13 symptoms were used. With the new MES, the reduced rulesare controlled instead of all possibilities (213= 8192 different possibilitiesoccur). By controlling reduced rules, results are found more quickly. The method of two-level simplification of Boolean functions was used to obtain Reduced Rule Base. Thanks to the developed application with the number of dynamic inputs andoutputs on different platforms, anyone can easily test their own cancer easily.METHODS: More accurate results were obtained considering all the possibilitiesrelated to cancer. Thirteen different risk factors were determined to determinethe type of cancer. The truth table produced in our study has 13 inputs and 4outputs. The Boolean Function Minimization method is used to obtain lesssituations by simplifying logical functions. Diagnosis of cancer quickly thanksto control of the simplified 4 output functions.RESULTS: Diagnosis made with the 4 output values obtained using Reduced Rule Basewas found to be quicker than diagnosis made by screening all 213= 8192possibilities. With the improved MES, more probabilities were added to theprocess and more accurate diagnostic results were obtained. As a result of thesimplification process in breast and renal cancer diagnosis 100% diagnosis speed gain, in cervical cancer and lung cancer diagnosis rate gain of 99% was obtained.CONCLUSIONS: With Boolean function minimization, less number of rules isevaluated instead of evaluating a large number of rules. Reducing the number ofrules allows the designed system to work more efficiently and to save time, andfacilitates to transfer the rules to the designed Expert systems. Interfaces weredeveloped in different software platforms to enable users to test the accuracy ofthe application. Any one is able to diagnose the cancer itself usingdeterminative risk factors. Thereby likely to beat the cancer with earlydiagnosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.01.020 PMID: 29477419
