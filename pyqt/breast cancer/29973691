Genome-wide analyses have revealed abundant and evolutionarilyconserved circular RNAs across species, which suggest specific physiologicalroles of these species. Using a microarray approach, we detected increasedexpression of a circular RNA circ-Dnmt1 in eight breast cancer cell lines and in patients with breast carcinoma. Silencing circ-Dnmt1 inhibited cell proliferationand survival. Ectopic circ-Dnmt1 increased the proliferative and survivalcapacities of breast cancer cells by stimulating cellular autophagy. We foundthat circ-Dnmt1-mediated autophagy was essential in inhibiting cellularsenescence and increasing tumor xenograft growth. We further found thatectopically expressed circ-Dnmt1 could interact with both p53 and AUF1, promotingthe nuclear translocation of both proteins. Nuclear translocation of p53 induced cellular autophagy while AUF1 nuclear translocation reduced Dnmt1 mRNAinstability, resulting in increased Dnmt1 translation. From here, functionalDnmt1 could then translocate into the nucleus, inhibiting p53 transcription.Computational algorithms revealed that both p53 and AUF1 could bind to different regions of circ-Dnmt1 RNA. Our results showed that the highly expressed circular RNA circ-Dnmt1 could bind to and regulate oncogenic proteins in breast cancercells. Thus circ-Dnmt1 appears to be an oncogenic circular RNA with potential forfurther preclinical research.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0369-y PMID: 29973691
