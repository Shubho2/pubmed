Pathologists are increasingly confrontedwith transmale mastectomy specimens. It is not clear whether routinehistopathological examination is useful. This study explored the possible benefitof routine investigation through detailed description of lesions encountered inmastectomy specimens after female-to-male gender-confirming surgery.METHODS: Breast tissue from a cohort of transmen was reviewed. The presence ofbenign and malignant breast lesions was recorded. The number of terminalduct-lobule units (TDLUs) per ten low-power fields (LPFs) was quantified.Information on hormone therapy and morphometry was retrieved for selectedpatients.RESULTS: The cohort included 344 subjects with a mean age of 25·8 (range 16-61)years at the time of surgery; the age at surgery decreased significantly overtime. Older individuals presented with a significantly higher number of breastlesions. The number of TDLUs per LPF was lower in heavier breasts, but did notcorrelate with age. Breast lesions, either benign or malignant, were present in166 individuals (48·3 per cent). Invasive breast cancer was found in two (0·6 percent); one tumour was an unexpected finding. The number of breast lesionsencountered on histopathological examination increased significantly when moretissue blocks were taken.CONCLUSION: The discovery of an unexpected breast cancer in a 31-year-oldtransman emphasizes the importance of thorough routine histopathologicalexamination of mastectomy specimens. The number of tissue blocks taken should be based on age and breast weight.© 2018 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/bjs.10794 PMID: 29623678
