Despite widespread successful usage of these agentsfor the treatment of breast cancer, resistance, tumor relapse and metastasisremain the principal causes of mortality for patients with breast cancer. Whilenumerous groups have made major contributions toward an improved understanding ofresistance mechanisms, the currently insufficient grasp of the most criticalpathways involved in resistance is evident in the inability to adequately treatand drastically improve patient outcomes in females with hormone-refractorybreast cancer, including triple negative breast cancer. Therefore, furtherinvestigation of novel therapeutic approaches is paramount to reveal previouslyunconsidered agents that could be utilized to treat metastatic disease. Numerous naturally occurring phytochemicals have recently gained interest as potentialtherapeutic breast cancer agents appear to directly affect estrogen-dependent andestrogen-independent breast cancer cell proliferation, potentially via affecting breast cancer stem cell populations. While numerous natural compounds haveexhibited promise, they are limited by their bioavailability. Therefore, toeffectively treat future hormone-refractory breast tumors, it is critical toadequately refine and formulate these agents for effective therapeutic use anddelivery. Herein, the literature on the current state of phytochemicals isreviewed, including their limitations and potential as targeted therapies forbreast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8304 PMCID: PMC5943681PMID: 29755596
