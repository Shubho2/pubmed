The surrogacy of PFS or time to progression (TTP) for OShas not been formally investigated in HR+, HER2- MBC.Methods: A systematic literature review of RCTs in HR+, HER2- MBC was conductedto identify studies that reported both median PFS/TTP and OS. The correlationbetween PFS/TTP and OS was evaluated using Pearson's product-moment correlationand Spearman's rank correlation. Subgroup analyses were performed to explorepossible reasons for heterogeneity. Errors-in-variables weighted least squaresregression (LSR) was used to model incremental OS months as a function ofincremental PFS/TTP months. An exploratory analysis investigated the impact ofthree covariates (chemotherapy vs hormonal/targeted therapy, PFS vs TTP, andfirst-line therapy vs second-line therapy or greater) on OS prediction. The lower95% prediction band was used to determine the minimum incremental PFS/TTP months required to predict OS benefit (surrogate threshold effect [STE]).Results: Forty studies were identified. There was a statistically significantcorrelation between median PFS/TTP and OS (Pearson =0.741, P=0.000; Spearman=0.650, P=0.000). These results proved consistent for chemotherapy andhormonal/targeted therapy. Univariate LSR analysis yielded an R2 of 0.354 with 1 incremental PFS/TTP month corresponding to 1.13 incremental OS months.Controlling the type of treatment (chemotherapy vs hormonal/targeted therapy),line of therapy (first vs subsequent), and progression measure (PFS vs TTP) ledto an improved R2 of 0.569 with 1 PFS/TTP month corresponding to 0.78 OS months. The STE for OS benefit was 5-6 months of incremental PFS/TTP.Conclusion: We demonstrated a significant association between PFS/TTP and OS,which may justify the use of PFS/TTP as a surrogate for OS benefit in HR+, HER2- MBC.DOI: 10.2147/BCTT.S162841 PMCID: PMC5942170PMID: 29765247
