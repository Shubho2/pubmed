In addition to consuming glucose, glutamine may play the role as analternative source of nutrient for growth and survival. We aim to characterize a glutamine analog, 18F-(2 S,4 R)4-fluoroglutamine (18F-(2 S,4 R)4-FGln), as animaging agent for interrogating the role of glutamine from the in vitro study of tumor cells to clinical manifestation in breast cancer patients. Purity wasmeasured by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC), and thestability after production was evaluated in phosphate buffer saline (PBS),saline, and mouse and human serum buffers. The presence of Myc expression inMCF-7 and U87 cells was conducted using qPCR. In vitro cell uptake of 18F-(2 S,4 R)4-FGln in MCF-7 and U87 cells was directly compared with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose(18F-FDG). In vivo biodistribution and micro-PET imaging of 18F-(2 S,4 R)4-FGlnin MCF-7 bearing BALB/c nude mice were performed. PET/CT imaging of 18F-(2 S,4R)4-FGln was compared with 18F-FDG in the same group of breast cancer patients ( n = 10). We successfully synthesized 18F-(2 S,4 R)4-FGln with a highradiochemical purity (>98%), and the radiochemical purity was unchanged in PBSand saline buffers during a 2 h incubation. In vitro cell uptake studies of18F-(2 S,4 R)4-FGln displayed a rapid and higher uptake in MCF-7 and U87 cells ascompared with 18F-FDG. Biodistribution and micro-PET images showed excellenttumor accumulation of 18F-(2 S,4 R)4-FGln in the MCF-7-implanted mice tumormodel. In a preliminary clinical study, 18F-(2 S,4 R)4-FGln/PET detected morelesions in breast cancer patients than 18F-FDG/PET (90% vs 80%). Additionally, inone patient with breast lobular carcinoma, there was a lesion mean standardizeduptake value (SUVmean) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for 18F-(2 S,4 R)4-FGln higher than those obtained by 18F-FDG, as determined by PET imaging.18F-(2 S,4 R)4-FGln may be a useful glutamine-targeting metabolic probe fornoninvasive imaging of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00430 PMID: 29985631
