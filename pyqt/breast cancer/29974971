Thesystem can be useful to reduce the number of biopsies and pathological tests,which are invasive, costly, and often unnecessary.METHODS: The proposed CAD system classifies breast tumors into benign andmalignant classes using morphological and textural features extracted from breastultrasound (BUS) images. The images are first preprocessed to enhance the edgesand filter the speckles. The tumor is then segmented semiautomatically using the watershed method. Having the tumor contour, a set of 855 features including 21shape-based, 810 contour-based, and 24 textural features are extracted from each tumor. Then, a Bayesian Automatic Relevance Detection (ARD) mechanism is used forcomputing the discrimination power of different features and dimensionalityreduction. Finally, a logistic regression classifier computed the posteriorprobabilities of malignant vs benign tumors using the reduced set of features.RESULTS: A dataset of 104 BUS images of breast tumors, including 72 benign and 32malignant tumors, was used for evaluation using an eightfold cross-validation.The algorithm outperformed six state-of-the-art methods for BUS imageclassification with large margins by achieving 97.12% accuracy, 93.75%sensitivity, and 98.61% specificity rates.CONCLUSIONS: Using ARD, the proposed CAD system selects five new features forbreast tumor classification and outperforms state-of-the-art, making a reliableand complementary tool to help clinicians diagnose breast cancer.Â© 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/mp.13082 PMID: 29974971
