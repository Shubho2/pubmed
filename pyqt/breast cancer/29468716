The ageeffect on survival is nonlinear in practice and may have one or more importantchange-points at which the trend of the effect can be very different before andafter these threshold ages. Identification of these change-points allows clinicalresearchers to understand the biologic basis for the complex relation between ageand prognosis for optimal prognostic decision. This paper considers estimation ofthe potentially nonlinear age effect for general partly linear survival models toensure a valid statistical inference on the treatment effect. A simple andefficient sieve maximum likelihood estimation method that can be implementedeasily using standard statistical software is proposed. A data-driven adaptivealgorithm to determine the optimal location and the number of knots for theidentification of the change-points is suggested. Simulation studies areperformed to study the performance of the proposed method. For illustrationpurpose, the method is applied to a breast cancer data set from the public domainto investigate the effect of onset age on the disease-free survival of thepatients. The results revealed that the risk is highest among young patients and young postmenopausal patients, probably because of a change in hormonalenvironment during a certain phase of menopause.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/sim.7618 PMID: 29468716
