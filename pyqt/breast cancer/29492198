Kaplan-Meier plot analysis witha total of 734 ER+ samples and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis with 632 samples wereused in the study.Results: High expression of UBASH3B is negatively correlated with distantmetastasis free survival (DMFS, P = 0.01, P = 0.045, P = 0.04 in 2 independentdatasets and a merged dataset, respectively), disease specific survival (DSS, P =0.028) and disease free survival (DFS, P = 0.0052, P = 0.011, P = 0.016 in 3independent datasets, respectively) in ER+ breast cancer patients. Subsetanalysis found that UBASH3B also has prognostic value on both lymph node positiveand negative sub-populations with ER+ breast cancer. This study also demonstratesthat UBASH3B expression is tightly associated with tamoxifen resistance and TP53 mutation, which explains the association between UBASH3B and poor prognosis ofER+ breast cancer. Further analyses show that the expression of UBASH3B isaffected by promoter methylation and copy number loss. Besides, UBASH3B isinversely correlated with ER and down-regulated by ER. Importantly, we findcisplatin could be a therapeutic option targeting on UBASH3B in clinicalsettings.Conclusions: UBASH3B is negatively regulated by ER and confers poor outcome inER+ breast cancer patients. Cisplatin is a potential therapeutic option for themanagement of breast cancer patients with high expression of UBASH3B.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23608 PMCID: PMC5823602PMID: 29492198
