Risk alleles identified from genome-wide association studies(GWAS) could improve prognostication. Those risk alleles that coincided withgenes and somatic copy number aberrations associated with progression of PCa wereselected as the most relevant for prognostication. In a systematic literaturereview, a total of 698 studies were collated. Fifty-three unique SNPs residing in29 genomic regions, including 8q24, 10q11 and 19q13, were associated with PCaprogression. Functional studies implicated 21 of these single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) as modulating the expression of genes in the androgenreceptor pathway and several other oncogenes. In particular, 8q24, encompassingMYC, harbours a high density of SNPs conferring unfavourable pathologicalcharacteristics in low-grade PCa, while a copy number gain of MYC in low-gradePCa was associated with prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radicalprostatectomy. By combining GWAS data with gene expression and structuralrearrangements, risk alleles were identified that could provide a new basis fordeveloping a prognostication tool to guide therapy for men with early prostatecancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24400 PMCID: PMC5849176PMID: 29560112
