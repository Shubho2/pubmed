METHODS: Wequantified 51 18F-Fluoride PET/CT exams performed on female breast cancerpatients. Clinical information (age, time of disease, presence of visceralmetastases, and time to death, progression or bone event) was recorded. The totalvolume of fluoride-avid skeletal metastases (FTV10) and the total activity of18F-Fluoride-avid metastases (TLF10) were calculated manually (mTLF10 and mFTV10,respectively) and semi-automatically (saTLF10 and saFTV10, respectively).RESULTS: Manual and semi-automatic metrics were highly correlated (p<0.0001; CI0.9300 to 0.9769). On multivariable analysis, saTLF10 measures were significantlycorrelated to OS (P = 0.0001) and progression-free survival (P = 0.0006).Approximate times for calculating skeletal tumor burden (semi-automatic vsmanual) were, respectively: 30s vs 321s in patients with less than 5 metastases; 120s vs 640s in patients with 5-10 metastases and 240s vs 1207s in patients with more than 10 lesions. CONCLUSION: Semi-automatic quantification of whole-body18F-Fluoride PET/CT skeletal tumor burden can replace manual quantification inbreast cancer patients and is a strong independent prognostic imaging biomarker.Copyright Â© 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.DOI: 10.2967/jnmt.118.211474 PMID: 30076246
