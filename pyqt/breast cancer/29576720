Thetoxicity of the compounds was studied at three different cell types, normal mousefibroblast (Balb/3T3), mouse fibroblast (L929), and human VERO cells. Thestructures of novel compounds were determined using 1H and 13C NMR, FAB(+)-MS,and elemental analyses. Among the derivatives, 4a-k showed very high activityagainst MV4-11 cell line with IC50 values between 1.13 and 3.21 µg/ml.Additionally, the cytotoxic activity of compounds 4a-k against normal mousefibroblast Balb/3T3 cells is about 20-100 times lower than against cancer celllines. According to our results, compounds 4a, 4b, 4d, and 4i have very strongactivity against human breast carcinoma MCF-7, with IC50 values from 3.18 to4.28 µg/ml. Moreover, diaminotriazines 4a-l showed significant anti-Toxoplasmagondii activity, with IC50 values 9-68 times lower than those observed forsulfadiazine. Molecular docking studies indicated DNA-binding site of hTopoI and hTopoII as possible anticancer targets and purine nucleoside phosphorylase aspossible anti-toxoplasmosis target. Our UV-Vis spectroscopic results indicatealso that diaminotriazine-thiazoles tends to interact with DNA by intercalation. Additionally, the structure and the interaction and binding energies of a modelcomplex formed by compound 4a and two thymine molecules are investigated usingquantum mechanical methods.DOI: 10.1007/s00044-018-2136-6 PMCID: PMC5854716PMID: 29576720
