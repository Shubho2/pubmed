However, the mode of action (MOA) remained unclear.Cytotoxic and antiproliferative properties were determined in this study.Scoulerine reduces the mitochondrial dehydrogenases activity of the evaluatedleukemic cells with IC50 values ranging from 2.7 to 6.5 µM. The xCELLigencesystem revealed that scoulerine exerted potent antiproliferative activity inlung, ovarian and breast carcinoma cell lines. Jurkat and MOLT-4 leukemic cellstreated with scoulerine were decreased in proliferation and viability. Scoulerineacted to inhibit proliferation through inducing G2 or M-phase cell cycle arrest, which correlates well with the observed breakdown of the microtubule network,increased Chk1 Ser345, Chk2 Thr68 and mitotic H3 Ser10 phosphorylation.Scoulerine was able to activate apoptosis, as determined by p53 upregulation,increase caspase activity, Annexin V and TUNEL labeling. Results highlight thepotent antiproliferative and proapoptotic function of scoulerine in cancer cells caused by its ability to interfere with the microtubule elements of thecytoskeleton, checkpoint kinase signaling and p53 proteins. This is the firststudy of the mechanism of scoulerine at cellular and molecular level. Scoulerine is a potent antimitotic compound and that it merits further investigation as ananticancer drug.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22862-0 PMCID: PMC5859271PMID: 29555944
