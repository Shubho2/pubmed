This study aimed to determinethe knowledge and source of information about early detection techniques ofbreast cancer among Iranian women.Methods: Both International (PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) andnational (scientific information database [SID] and Magiran) databases werereviewed launching to September, 2017 to obtain related articles. Steps involvingthe screening, analysis of quality of the studies and extraction of papers wereperformed by two researchers.Results: Of the 749 studies searched initially, 25 studies performed on 11,756people were selected for the final stage. General knowledge for breast cancerscreening among women ranged from 4.5% to 45%. The number of people withsufficient knowledge about breast self-examination in various studies was between5% and 79.8%. The most important source of information was the Healthcare team.Conclusions: Considering the poor knowledge and different source of information, it is suggested that educational programs be conducted around the countryespecially in at-risk populations.DOI: 10.15430/JCP.2018.23.1.51 PMCID: PMC5886495PMID: 29629349
