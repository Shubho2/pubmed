Few studies have examined phthalates in relation to breast cancer(BC), and, to our knowledge, none have considered survival following BC.OBJECTIVES: We examined 11 urinary phthalate metabolites, individually and asmolar sum groupings, in association with BC incidence and subsequent survival.METHODS: Our study includes 710 women diagnosed with first primary BC in1996-1997 and 598 women without BC from Long Island, New York. Within 3 mo ofdiagnosis, participants provided spot urine samples. Nine phthalate metaboliteswere measured in all women; two [monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP) andmonocarboxy-isononyl phthalate (MCNP)] were measured in 320 women with and 205without BC. Women with BC were followed since diagnosis using the National Death Index; during follow-up (median=17.6 y), we identified 271 deaths (98 BCrelated). We examined creatinine-corrected metabolite concentrations inassociation with: BC, using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and95% confidence intervals (CIs) and all-cause/BC-specific mortality, using Coxregression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. We also examined effectmodification by body mass index (BMI) and estrogen receptor (ER) status.RESULTS: The highest (vs. lowest) quintiles of mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate(MCPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), MCNP, and MCOP were associated with BC ORsranging from 0.71-0.73. The highest (vs. lowest) quintiles of mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and MCOP were associated with BC-specific mortality HRs of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.04) and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.23, 1.35), respectively. For BC-specificmortality, interactions were significant between BMI and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxyhexyl)phthalate (MEOHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), andmono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), with positive associations amongwomen with BMI<25 and inverse associations among women with BMI≥25.0 kg/m2.CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with laboratory evidence, we observed inverseassociations between urinary concentrations of several phthalate metabolites and BC and subsequent survival; however, these results should be interpreted withcaution given that biospecimen collection among women with BC occurred afterdiagnosis, which may be of particular concern for our case-control findings.https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2083.DOI: 10.1289/EHP2083 PMCID: PMC6071801PMID: 29701940
