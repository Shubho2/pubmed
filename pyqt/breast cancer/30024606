Therelationship between HOTTIP expression, prognosis, tumor size, and stage ofmammary cancer patients was analyzed. Subsequently, we constructed lentivirus of HOTTIP. Proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and invasion of mammary cancercells transfected with HOTTIP lentivirus were detected by CCK-8 (cell countingkit-8), colony formation, flow cytometry, and transwell assay, respectively. The effect of overexpressed HOTTIP on PI3K/AKT pathway was detected by Western blot.RESULTS: HOTTIP was overexpressed in mammary cancer tissues than that ofparacancerous tissues. HOTTIP expression was negatively correlated with theprognosis of mammary cancer. Overexpressed HOTTIP remarkably promoted cell cycle,and increased expressions of CyclineD1 and PCNA. Meanwhile, overexpressed HOTTIP inhibited cell apoptosis, whereas promoted proliferation and colony formationabilities. Western blot results demonstrated that overexpressed HOTTIP promotesproliferation of mammary cancer cells via PI3K/AKT pathway.CONCLUSIONS: HOTTIP remarkably promotes proliferative and invasive abilities, butinhibits cell apoptosis of mammary cancer cells via PI3K/AKT pathway.PMID: 30024606
