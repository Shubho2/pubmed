Epub 2018 Jul 2.HOXA5 is a tumor suppressor gene that is decreased in gastric cancer.Peng X(1), Zha L(1), Chen A(1), Wang Z(1).Author information: (1)Gastrointestinal Surgical Unit, The First Affiliated Hospital of ChongqingMedical University, Chongqing 400000, P.R. China.The abnormal expression of homeobox A5 (HOXA5) has been observed in breast andcolon cancer; however, the clinical significance of HOXA5 in gastric cancer (GC) is not yet clear. In this study, we found that HOXA5 expression was decreased in GC tissues at the mRNA and protein level compared with paracancerous tissuesusing reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR) and western blot analysis,respectively. Immunohistochemistry and Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis confirmedthat the underexpression of HOXA5 was associated with GC progression andindicated a poor prognosis of patients with GC. Given that proliferation‑related genes may be potential target genes of HOXA5, we performed a series ofexperiments in vitro to examine the effects of HOXA5 on the proliferation of GCcells. A CCK‑8 assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometry revealed thatHOXA5 inhibited the abnormal proliferation of GC cells, and this finding wasfurther supported by a 5‑ethynyl‑2'‑deoxyuridine (EdU) assay. Further mechanisticinvestigation clarified that HOXA5 promoted the protein expression of p21 andinhibited the protein expression of c‑Myc and Ki67. Additionally, the use of nudemouse models also verified that HOXA5 suppressed the proliferation of GC cellsin vivo. Collectively, the findings of this study demonstrate that HOXA5 acts as a tumor suppressor gene during the development and progresion of GC, possiblyfunctioning by inhibiting the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6537 PMID: 30015922
