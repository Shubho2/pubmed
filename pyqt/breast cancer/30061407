Metabolic deregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of somecancers and in metabolic disorders and may result from the inactivation of p53functions. Using RNA sequencing and ChIP sequencing of cancer cells andpreadipocytes, we demonstrate that p53 modulates several metabolic processes via the transactivation of energy metabolism genes including dihydropyrimidinase-like4 (DPYSL4). DPYSL4 is a member of the collapsin response mediator protein family,which is involved in cancer invasion and progression. Intriguingly, DPYSL4overexpression in cancer cells and preadipocytes up-regulated ATP production and oxygen consumption, while DPYSL4 knockdown using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9down-regulated energy production. Furthermore, DPYSL4 was associated withmitochondrial supercomplexes, and deletion of its dihydropyrimidinase-like domainabolished its association and its ability to stimulate ATP production andsuppress the cancer cell invasion. Mouse-xenograft and lung-metastasis modelsindicated that DPYSL4 expression compromised tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.Consistently, database analyses demonstrated that low DPYSL4 expression wassignificantly associated with poor survival of breast and ovarian cancers inaccordance with its reduced expression in certain types of cancer tissues.Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis using the adipose tissue of obese patientsrevealed that DPYSL4 expression was positively correlated with INFg and body massindex in accordance with p53 activation. Together, these results suggest thatDPYSL4 plays a key role in the tumor-suppressor function of p53 by regulatingoxidative phosphorylation and the cellular energy supply via its association withmitochondrial supercomplexes, possibly linking to the pathophysiology of bothcancer and obesity.Copyright Â© 2018 the Author(s).
