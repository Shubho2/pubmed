China.Simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3‑hydroxy‑3-methylglutaryl‑coenzyme A reductase, is been used in the clinic due to its pleiotropic effects, such as breast cancer,prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer. Simvastatin has recently been demonstrated toserve a potential role in the prophylaxis and therapeutics of a number of humancancers. The majority of reports concerning simvastatin treatment in the majorityof human cancers have demonstrated that survivin is significantly decreased as a result and has been implicated in tumorigenesis. However, only a limited numberof studies have investigated the use of simvastatin for the treatment of salivarygland adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC). Therefore, this agent is a candidate forfurther investigation. The aim of the present study was to investigate theeffects of simvastatin on the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of the human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cell line, SACC‑83, as well as survivinexpression in the cells. The Cell Counting kit‑8 assay results revealed thatsimvastatin inhibited the proliferation of SACC‑83 cells in a dose‑dependent (10 to 50 µM) and time‑dependent (24 to 48 h) manner when compared with the untreatedcells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that simvastatin increased thepercentage of cells in early and late apoptosis. Invasion assays revealed thatsimvastatin treatment inhibited the invasiveness of SACC‑83 cells in adose‑dependent manner. In addition, simvastatin downregulated survivin expressionin SACC‑83 cells. In conclusion, simvastatin significantly inhibited theproliferation and invasion of SACC‑83 cells, induced apoptosis, and reduced theexpression of survivin, which suggests that simvastatin may be a novel target forSACC therapy.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9204 PMCID: PMC6072162PMID: 29956779
