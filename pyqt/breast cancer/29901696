It is necessary to identifynew markers for predicting tumor progression and therapeutic molecular targets.It has been reported that CD147 is one of the most commonly expressed proteins inprimary tumors and in metastatic cells. In this study, we investigated the roleof CD147 in human breast cancer metastasis and invasion, and examined itsunderlying molecular mechanisms. Immunohistochemistry results revealed highexpression of CD147 in human breast tumor tissues, which was positivelycorrelated with the malignancy of breast cancer. MCF-7 cells were transfectedwith CD147 siRNA eukaryotic expression vector, which resulted in significantknockdown of CD147. We found that CD147 siRNA dramatically inhibited cellproliferation, metastasis, and invasion. Furthermore, our results demonstratedthat CD147 siRNA inhibited the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9)but had no significant effect on matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2). In addition,CD147 siRNA significantly inhibited the production of vascular endothelial growthfactor (VEGF). Taken together, these data indicate that CD147 promotes breastcancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion by modulating MMP-9 and VEGF expression. Thus, CD147 may be used as an important indicator for the judgment ofmalignant behavior of breast cancer, and may be a potential novel target forbreast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1093/abbs/gmy062 PMID: 29901696
