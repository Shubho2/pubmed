However, its clinical application is limited by cardiotoxicity, such as cardiomyopathy, thatonce developed carries a poor prognosis and is frequently fatal. The controlledrelease of doxorubicin by means of a smart carrier is a strategy to overcome the aforementioned drawback. Herein, doxorubicin/keratin nanoparticles were prepared by loading the drug through ionic gelation and aggregation methods, without usingcross linkers, organic solvents neither surfactants. Both methodologies affordnanoparticles with yields up to 100 wt%, depending on the loading amount ofdoxorubicin. Although aggregation yield smaller nanoparticles (≈100 nm), ionicgelation allows a higher drug loading (up to 30 wt%,). More importantly,nanoparticles obtained through this procedure display a pH-responsive release of the drug: indeed Peppas-Salhin model suggests that, the doxorubicin releasemechanism is predominantly controlled by diffusion at pH 7.4 and by proteinswelling at pH 5. Moreover, nanoparticles prepared by ionic gelation resulted in more efficient cell killing of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells thanthose prepared by aggregation. Based on the herein presented preliminary results,ionic gelation emerges as a promising approach for the preparation ofkeratin-based doxorubicin nanocarriers for cancer therapy, that is worth tofurther investigate.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
