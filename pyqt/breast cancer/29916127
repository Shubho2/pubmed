Lyon, UFR de Médecine Lyon-Est, Lyon, France.jean-charles.rousseau@inserm.fr.Periostin is an extracellular matrix protein that actively contributes to tumorprogression and metastasis. Here, we hypothesized that it could be a marker ofbone metastasis formation. To address this question, we used two polyclonalantibodies directed against the whole molecule or its C-terminal domain toexplore the expression of intact and truncated forms of periostin in the serumand tissues (lung, heart, bone) of wild-type and periostin-deficient mice. Innormal bones, periostin was expressed in the periosteum and specific periostinproteolytic fragments were found in bones, but not in soft tissues. In animalsbearing osteolytic lesions caused by 4T1 cells, C-terminal intact periostin(iPTN) expression disappeared at the invasive front of skeletal tumors wherebone-resorbing osteoclasts were present. In vitro, we found that periostin was a substrate for osteoclast-derived cathepsin K, generating proteolytic fragmentsthat were not recognized by anti-periostin antibodies directed against iPTN. Invivo, using an in-house sandwich immunoassay aimed at detecting iPTN only, weobserved a noticeable reduction of serum periostin levels (- 26%; P < 0.002) inanimals bearing osteolytic lesions caused by 4T1 cells. On the contrary, thisdecrease was not observed in women with breast cancer and bone metastases whenperiostin was measured with a human assay detecting total periostin.Collectively, these data showed that mouse periostin was degraded at the bonemetastatic sites, potentially by cathepsin K, and that the specific measurementof iPTN in serum should assist in detecting bone metastasis formation in breastcancer.DOI: 10.1007/s00223-018-0444-y PMID: 29916127
