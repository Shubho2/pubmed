Analyses occurred between 1/2017 and 5/2017.MAIN MEASURES: Across four nested levels (patient, PCP, primary care practice,and health system), frequency distributions and adjusted rates of primary carepractice characteristics and survey results for four breast screening metrics(percent screened overall, and percent screened age 40-49, 50-74, and 75+) werereported. We used hierarchical multi-level mixed and random effects analysis toassess the relative influences of PCP, primary care practice, and health systemon the breast screening metrics.KEY RESULTS: Overall, the proportion of women undergoing breast cancer screening was 73.1% (73.4% for ages 40-49, 76.5% for 50-74, and 51.1% for 75+). Patientethnicity and number of primary care visits were strongly associated withscreening rates. After adjusting for woman-level factors, 24% of the overallvariation among PCPs was attributable to the primary care practice level, 35% to the health system level, and 41% to the residual variation among PCPs withinpractice. No specific provider-level characteristics were found to bestatistically significant determinants of screening rates.CONCLUSIONS: After accounting for woman-level characteristics, the remainingvariation in breast cancer screening was largely due to provider and healthsystem variation.DOI: 10.1007/s11606-018-4560-1 PMID: 30076569
