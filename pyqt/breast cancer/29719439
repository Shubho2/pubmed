In the literature, rt dose and fractionation schedules areinconsistently reported. We sought to determine the pattern of rt prescribingpractices in a provincial rt program for patients treated with mastectomy andreconstruction.Methods: Women diagnosed with stages 0-iii breast cancer between January 2012 andDecember 2013 and treated with curative-intent rt were identified from aclinicopathology database. Patient demographic, tumour, and treatment informationwere extracted. Of the identified patients, those undergoing mastectomy were the focus of the present analysis.Results: Of 4016 patients identified, 1143 (28%) underwent mastectomy. Thepatients treated with mastectomy had a median age of 57 years, and 37% of themunderwent reconstruction. Treatment with more than 16 fractions of rt wasassociated with autologous reconstruction [odds ratio (or): 37.2; 95% confidence interval (ci): 11.2 to 123.7; p < 0.001], implant reconstruction (or: 93.3; 95%ci: 45.3 to 192.2; p < 0.001), and treating centre. Hypofractionated treatmentwas associated with older age (or: 0.94; 95% ci: 0.92 to 0.96; p < 0.001), andliving more than 400 km from a treatment centre (or: 0.37; 95% ci: 0.16 to 0.86; p = 0.02).Conclusions: Prescribing practices in breast cancer patients undergoingmastectomy are influenced by reconstruction intent, age, nodal status, anddistance from the treatment centre. Those factors should be considered whenmaking treatment decisions.DOI: 10.3747/co.25.3773 PMCID: PMC5927794PMID: 29719439
