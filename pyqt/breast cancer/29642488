This study investigates the selectivekilling potential and mechanisms of sinularin-treated breast cancer cells. In3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay, sinularin dose-responsively decreased thecell viability of two breast cancer (SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231) cells, but showed lesseffect on breast normal (M10) cells after a 24 h treatment. According to7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) flow cytometry, sinularin dose-responsively inducedthe G2/M cycle arrest of SKBR3 cells. Sinularin dose-responsively inducedapoptosis on SKBR3 cells in terms of a flow cytometry-based annexin V/7AAD assay and pancaspase activity, as well as Western blotting for cleaved forms ofpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspases 3, 8, and 9. These caspases and PARPactivations were suppressed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) pretreatment. Moreover,sinularin dose-responsively induced oxidative stress and DNA damage according to flow cytometry analyses of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MitoMP), mitochondrial superoxide, and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine(8-oxodG)). In conclusion, sinularin induces selective killing, G2/M arrest,apoptosis, and oxidative DNA damage of breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23040849 PMID: 29642488
