Epub2018 Apr 3.How to use the Kaiser score as a clinical decision rule for diagnosis inmultiparametric breast MRI: a pictorial essay.Dietzel M(1), Baltzer PAT(2).Author information: (1)Department of Radiology, University Hospital Erlangen-Nürnberg,Maximiliansplatz 1, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.(2)Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-Guided Therapy, Division ofMolecular and Gender Imaging, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer-Guertel,18-20, Vienna, Austria. pascal.baltzer@meduniwien.ac.at.Due to its superior sensitivity, breast MRI (bMRI) has been established as animportant additional diagnostic tool in the breast clinic and is used forscreening in patients with an elevated risk for breast cancer. Breast MRI,however, is a complex tool, providing multiple images containing severalcontrasts. Thus, reading bMRI requires a structured approach. A lack of structurewill increase the rate of false-positive findings and sacrifice most of theadvantages of bMRI as additional work-up will be required. While the BI-RADS(Breast Imaging Reporting And Data System) lexicon is a major step towardstandardised and structured reporting, it does not provide a clinical decisionrule with which to guide diagnostic decisions. Such a clinical decision rule,however, is provided by the Kaiser score, which combines five independentdiagnostic BI-RADS lexicon criteria (margins, SI-time curve type, internalenhancement and presence of oedema) in an intuitive flowchart. The resultingscore provides probabilities of malignancy that can be used for evidence-baseddecision-making in the breast clinic. Notably, considerable benefits have beendemonstrated for radiologists with initial and intermediate experience in bMRI.This pictorial essay is a practical guide to the application of the Kaiser score in the interpretation of breast MRI examinations.TEACHING POINTS: • bMRI requiresstandardisation of patient-management, protocols, and reading set-up. • ReadingbMRI includes the assessment of breast parenchyma, associated findings, andlesions. • Diagnostic decisions should be made according to evidence-basedclinical decision rules. • The evidence-based Kaiser score is applicableindependent of bMRI protocol and scanner. • The Kaiser score provides highdiagnostic accuracy with low inter-observer variability.DOI: 10.1007/s13244-018-0611-8 PMCID: PMC5990997PMID: 29616496
