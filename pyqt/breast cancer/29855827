These strategieshave been widely adopted for patients having breast conservation. This reportdemonstrates the potential impact of the AMAROS trial on axillary therapy in aretrospective cohort of mastectomy patients.METHODS: Patients undergoing primary mastectomy for cT1-2N0 breast cancer who hadone or two positive SLNs were identified from institutional databases(2005-2015). Locoregional management strategies were evaluated, and variablespredictive of the use of postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) were identified.RESULTS: Among 2594 mastectomies, 193 (7%) met the AMAROS eligibility criteria.The median patient age was 50 years (range 22-83 years). Locoregional treatmentconsisted of ALND + PMRT for 102 patients (53%), ALND alone for 66 patients(34%), PMRT alone for 11 patients (6%), and observation for 14 patients (7%).Overall, 59 ALND patients (35%) had additional positive nodes. In themultivariate analysis, age younger than 50 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.55; 95%confidence interval [CI] 1.57-8.45), lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (OR 5.78; 95% CI 2.53-4.78), macrometastases (OR 3.99; 95% CI 1.54-10.97), and extracapsularextension (OR 11.66; 95% CI 2.55-88.34) were associated with receipt of PMRT.CONCLUSION: In this cohort of AMAROS-eligible patients, 168 (87%) underwent ALND,102 (61%) of whom also received PMRT, suggesting that AxRT could have been usedinstead of ALND for a significant number of patients. Preoperative factorsassociated with the receipt of PMRT, such as young age and LVI, may be useful fordefining a multidisciplinary decision-making framework for axillary management inthis population.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6519-1 PMID: 29855827
