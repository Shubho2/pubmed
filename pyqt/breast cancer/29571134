Flavonoid compound oroxylin A (OA) possesses strong anti-cancereffects especially on the liver and breast cancer. However, despite the lowbioavailability, the disposition of OA and its active metabolite in the targetcancer cells remained unclear. In current study, a highly sensitive and selectivesolid phase extraction (SPE)-UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated tosimultaneously quantify the concentrations of OA and its major active metabolite oroxylin A 7-O-d-glucuronide (OG) in HepG2 cell lysate and multiple subcellularorganelle fractions. The proposed method appeared to be suitable for the analysiswith desirable linearity(R2 > 0.99). The relative standard deviations (RSDs) ofintra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy were less than 9.9% and -7.7%, 8.4%and 11% for OA and OG in cell lysate respectively. The intra- precision andaccuracy was less than 9.5% and -11.3%, 9.4% and 12.3% for OA and OG insubcellular organelles respectively. The range of absolute recovery of thismethod in the cell lysate was from 73.1% ± 1.4% to 87.9% ± 6.7%. The RSDs ofmatrix effects of the quality control (QC) samples were below 15%. The uptake anddistribution experiments demonstrated a time-dependent transport characteristicin HepG2 cell lines. Furthermore, both OA and OG were mainly distributed intonuclei after taken up by the tumor cells. In addition, OG was also distributedinto mitochondria, which indicates another potential target of OG. The presentstudy, for the first time, reports the in vitro cell pharmacokinetics profiles ofOA and OG in tumor cell lines in vitro.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
