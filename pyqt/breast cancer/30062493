Affectedpersons need generation-specific attention and care; however, no nationwide studyhas investigated the medical care structure for AYA cancer treatment in Japan.METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey of AYA cancer for frequency of AYApatients, type of cancer, medical facilities, and certified cancer professionals.Data were collected from 14,713 patients at 218 Core Cancer Treatment Hospitals.RESULTS: The average proportion of AYA cancer patients to all cancer patients was3.6%. The median number of patients aged 15 to 24 years per hospital was small(n = 5, range 1-51). The most frequent primary site of AYA cancer was the cervix uteri, but when cancer in situ was excluded, the hematopoietic malignancies were the most frequent cancer in males and females aged 15-24 years. In the age group 25-39 years, testicular and breast cancers were the most frequent cancers inmales and females, respectively. Certified cancer professionals and facilitiesare necessary for appropriate care of AYA cancer patients, but the availabilityof such professionals varied greatly among hospitals. Hospitals with few AYAcancer patients were less likely to employ such physicians.CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that medical care for AYA cancer inJapan requires further refinement and a multidisciplinary approach (217 words).DOI: 10.1007/s10147-018-1323-2 PMID: 30062493
