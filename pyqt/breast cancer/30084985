Herein,we observed frequent amplification of the MIR191/425 locus in breast cancer,which is correlated with poor survival outcome. We demonstrated that themiR-191/425 cluster binds the 3'UTR of the DICER1 transcript andpost-transcriptionally represses DICER1 expression, thereby impairing globalmicroRNAs biogenesis. Functionally, the forced expression of miR-191 or miR-425stimulated the proliferation, survival, migration and invasion of breast cancercells, while the inhibition of miR-191 or miR-425 suppressed these oncogenicbehaviors of breast cancer cells, in a manner dependent on miR-191/425-mediateddownregulation of DICER1. Furthermore, the miR-191/425 cluster promoted breasttumor growth, invasion and metastasis in vivo. The let-7 family of miRNAs wasdownregulated upon forced expression of miR-191 or miR-425, with a corresponding increase in the levels of let-7 target, HMGA2. The forced expression of let-7partially abrogated the miR-191/425-mediated oncogenic effects in breast cancercells, suggestive of let-7 as a downstream effector of the miR-191/425-DICER1axis. Collectively, we proposed that the inhibition of global miRNA processing,through miR-191/425-mediated downregulation of DICER1, promotes breast cancerprogression.DOI: 10.1093/carcin/bgy102 PMID: 30084985
