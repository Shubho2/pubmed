It is known to be involved in lipid metabolism. The role of FABP4 has been reported in various cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer,breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and prostatic cancer. However, its role remainsunclear in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In our study, we investigated theexpression of FABP4 at both mRNA and protein levels, and by examining 175 casesof patients with cancer of the liver tissue microarray, the significance between the expression of FABP4 and clinical characteristics had been discussed. We foundthat FABP4 was lowly expressed in HCC tissues compared to the correspondingtissue adjacent, and the expression of FABP4 was significantly associated withthe tumor size, PVTT, recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Moreover,multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the expression of FABP4, Alb,AFP, HBsAg, and PVTT were independent risk factors for overall survival, and the expression of FABP4, AFP, GGT, tumor size, and encapsulation were independentrisk factors for HCC recurrence. In addition, we revealed that FABP4 suppressedHCC cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of FABP4led to inhibit tumor growth and decreased tumor volume in vivo. These phenotypes were associated with altered expression of Snail and p-STAT3. Our studies thussuggest that FABP4 could be a potential target for HCC chemotherapy.© 2018 The Authors.
