Specific aims of acomplex project were partly focused on revealing new biomarkers of cancer. Wedesigned and set up novel techniques to facilitate the detection of cancerouscells.Materials and methods: As a novel approach, we investigated B cells infiltrating breast carcinomas and melanomas (TIL-B) in terms of their tumour antigen binding potential. By developing the TIL-B phage display technology we provide here a newtechnology for the specific detection of highly tumour-associated antigens.Single chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragment phage ELISA, immunofluorescence (IF)FACS analysis, chamber slide technique with IF confocal laser microscopy andimmunohistochemistry (IHC) in paraffin-embedded tissue sections were set up andstandardized.Results: We showed strong tumour-associated disialylated glycosphingolipidexpression levels on various cancer cells using scFv antibody fragments,generated previously by uniquely invasive breast carcinoma TIL-B phage displaylibrary technology.Conclusions: We report herein a novel strategy to obtain antibody fragments ofhuman origin that recognise tumour-associated ganglioside antigens. Ourinvestigations have the power to detect privileged molecules in cancerprogression, invasiveness, and metastases. The technical achievements of thisstudy are being harnessed for early diagnostics and effective cancertherapeutics.DOI: 10.5114/wo.2018.73884 PMCID: PMC5885074PMID: 29628793
