Determining the impacts on cellular mechanics each pathway incites alone and in unison is critical to developing non-toxic cancer therapies fortriple-negative breast cancers. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) knockoutand activated KRAS (Kristen rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) overexpression inhealthy MCF-10A human breast epithelial cells activated the PI3K and Ras/MAPKpathways, respectively. Cell stiffness and fluidity were simultaneously measured using atomic force microscopy. Results suggest that PTEN knockout reduced cellstiffness and increased cell fluidity independent of PI3K activation. Effects of activated KRAS overexpression on cell stiffness depends on rigidity of cellculture substrate. Activated KRAS overexpression also counteracts the effects of PTEN knockout.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19061613 PMCID: PMC6032141PMID: 29848992
