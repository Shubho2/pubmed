Tam-SLNs were produced by the hot homogenization method. Thecharacterization studies of Tam-SLNs demonstrated good physical stability withsmall particle size. The in vitro cytotoxicity results showed that Tam-SLNsenhanced the efficacy of Tam and reversed the acquired Tam resistance by inducingapoptosis, altering the expression levels of specific miRNA and the relatedapoptosis-associated target-genes in both MCF7 and MCF7-TamR cells withoutdamaging the MCF10A control cells (p < 0.05). In conclusion, we demonstrated amolecular mechanism of the induction of apoptosis by Tam-SLNs in MCF7 andMCF7-TamR cells, and thus, we demonstrated that Tam-SLNs were more effective thanTam. The present study suggests that the use SLNs may be a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome Tam-resistance in breast cancer for clinical use.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
