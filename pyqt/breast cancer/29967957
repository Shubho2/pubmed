Core biopsy and surgical pathology results within 365 days after the mammogram werecollected. Performance metrics, including cancer detection rate (CDR), abnormalinterpretation rate (AIR), positive predictive value (PPV) 2, PPV3, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models werefit to compare performance metrics in the DM and DM/DBT groups while adjustingfor clinical covariates.RESULTS: A total of 22,883 mammograms were performed before DBT integration (DMgroup), and 22,824 mammograms were performed after complete DBT integration(DM/DBT group). After adjusting for multiple variables, the CDR was similar inboth groups (38.2 per 1,000 examinations in the DM/DBT group versus 31.3 per1,000 examinations in the DM group, p = 0.14); however, a higher proportion ofcancers were invasive rather than in situ in the DM/DBT group [83.7% (731/873)versus 72.3% (518/716), p < 0.01]. The AIR was lower in the DM/DBT group (p <0.01), and PPV2, PPV3, and specificity were higher in the DM/DBT group (all p =0.01 or p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Complete integration of DBT into the diagnostic setting isassociated with improved diagnostic performance. Increased utilization of DBT maythus result in better patient outcomes and lead to a shift in the benchmarks thathave been established for DM.KEY POINTS: • Integration of tomosynthesis into the diagnostic setting isassociated with improved performance. • A higher proportion of cancers areinvasive rather than in situ with digital breast tomosynthesis. • Increasedutilization of tomosynthesis may lead to a shift in established benchmarks.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5596-7 PMID: 29967957
