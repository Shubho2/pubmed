However, BC is still the first cause of death amongwomen. Interestingly, several preclinical studies and some clinical evidences arefocused their attention on the role of immune system and immunotherapy on cancer control, also in BC. Areas covered: Usually, BC has been considered a notimmunogenic tumor for its low mutational load. However, recent studies haveevidenced that some subtypes, triple negative and HER-2 positive BC, are 'hot'tumors, thus more immunogenic. Moreover, the presence of immune infiltrate ispositively associated with favorable prognosis. Therefore, the use ofimmune-checkpoint inhibitors seems to be an encouraging treatment option also in BC. Among these drugs, atezolizumab is an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody with aparticular structure that reduce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity againstT cells, increasing quantitatively and qualitatively the effective response.Expert opinion: The use of immunotherapy is a promising option for BC. However,at the same time it still raises many doubts. Surely, the research and thevalidation of immune biomarkers can permit to identify patients who more benefit from these drugs.DOI: 10.1080/14712598.2018.1469619 PMID: 29690797
