Although selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells, adverse reaction in miceand rats has been suggested. EA is a remarkably potent activator of ion channels formed by Transient Receptor Potential Canonical 4 and 5 proteins (TRPC4 andTRPC5) and TRPC4 is essential for EA-mediated cancer cell cytotoxicity. Here wespecifically investigated the relevance of TRPC4 and TRPC5 to the adversereaction. Injection of EA (2 mg.kg-1 i.p.) adversely affected mice for about 1hour, manifesting as a marked reduction in locomotor activity, after which theyfully recovered. TRPC4 and TRPC5 single knockout mice were partially protectedand double knockout mice fully protected. TRPC4/TRPC5 double knockout mice werealso protected against intravenous injection of EA. Importance of TRPC4/TRPC5channels was further suggested by pre-administration of Compound 31 (Pico145), a potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor of TRPC4/TRPC5 channels which didnot cause adverse reaction itself but prevented adverse reaction to EA. EA wasdetected in the plasma but not the brain and so peripheral mechanisms wereimplicated but not identified. The data confirm the existence of adverse reactionto EA in mice and suggest that it depends on a combination of TRPC4 and TRPC5which therefore overlaps partially with TRPC4-dependent cancer cell cytotoxicity.The underlying nature of the observed adverse reaction to EA, as a consequence ofTRPC4/TRPC5 channel activation, remains unclear and warrants furtherinvestigation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25659 PMCID: PMC6049859PMID: 30038709
