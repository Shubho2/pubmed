Events are simulated in the absence ofscreening and treatment, and interventions are then applied to assess theirimpact on population breast cancer trends. The model accommodates differences in natural history associated with estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (HER2) biomarkers, as well as conventional breast cancer riskfactors. The approach for simulating breast cancer natural history isphenomenological, relying on dates, stage, and age of clinical and screendetection for a tumor molecular subtype without explicitly modeling tumor growth.The inputs to the model are regularly updated to reflect current practice.Numerous technical modifications, including the use of object-orientedprogramming (C++), and more efficient algorithms, along with hardware advances,have increased program efficiency permitting simulations of large samples.RESULTS: The model results consistently match key temporal trends in US breastcancer incidence and mortality.CONCLUSION: The model has been used in collaboration with other CISNET models to assess cancer control policies and will be applied to evaluate clinical trialdesign, recurrence risk, and polygenic risk-based screening.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X17698685 PMCID: PMC5862062 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29554462
