Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and overall survival (OS)were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier-estimates. A multivariate Cox proportional hazardsregression model was used to identify potential independent prognostic factorsassociated with the risk of IBTR.RESULTS: A total of 1081 patients were included in this analysis. Simultaneousadditional excisions were performed in 79.4% of patients (tumor positive: 12.2%).Median follow-up after primary diagnosis was 124 months. The IBTR rate after 15years was significantly higher in the group with tumor positive AE (no AE (10.2%)vs. AE tumor positive (27.5%) p = 0.002; AE tumor negative (14.0%) vs. AE tumorpositive (27.5%) p = 0.008). The OS rate did not differ significantly betweengroups. Multivariate analysis revealed residual cancer in AE being associatedwith a significantly increased relative risk of IBTR of 2.0 (p = 0.014).CONCLUSION: In the current analysis residual disease in simultaneous additionalexcisions was associated with an increased risk for IBTR despite negative finalmargin status. This should be considered in the overall therapeutic concept.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
