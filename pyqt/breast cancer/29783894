Epub 2018May 22.Fulvestrant in management of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.Shafaee MN(1)(2)(3), Ellis MJ(1)(2)(3).Author information: (1)Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.(2)Lester & Sue Smith Breast Center, Houston, TX, USA.(3)Dan L Duncan Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.Fulvestrant is a steroidal selective estrogen receptor degrader that was approvedby the US FDA in 2002 for treatment of ER-positive metastatic breast cancer(ER + MBC) post-progression on aromatase inhibitors. In 2017, the label wasupdated to include endocrine therapy naive ER + MBC. While initially fulvestrant was thought to be equivalent to aromatase inhibitors with monthly dose of 250 mg intramuscular injection, several postmarketing trials challenged thisunderstanding. Subsequently, the recommended dose changed to 500 mg monthly plus loading dose, and this was proven to be superior to anastrozole in efficacy. Mostrecently the results of FALCON trial have further challenged the way fulvestrant is viewed and used. This report provides a historical perspective on thiscompound, its evolving role in management of ER + MBC and what the future mayhold for this drug.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-0489 PMID: 29783894
