Population-based sample of 812 164women undergoing screening, 2003 through 2013.Exposures: A total of 2 048 994 digital mammography and/or breast MRI screeningepisodes (mammogram alone vs MRI with or without screening mammogram within 30days).Main Outcomes and Measures: Biopsy intensity (surgical greater than core greater than fine-needle aspiration) and yield (invasive cancer greater than ductalcarcinoma in situ greater than high-risk benign greater than benign) within 90days of a screening episode. We computed age-adjusted rates of biopsy intensity(per 1000 screening episodes) and biopsy yield (per 1000 screening episodes with biopsies). Outcomes were stratified by PHBC and by BCSC 5-year breast cancer riskamong women without PHBC.Results: We included 101 103 and 1 939 455 mammogram screening episodes in women with and without PHBC, respectively; MRI screening episodes included 3763 withPHBC and 4673 without PHBC. Age-adjusted core and surgical biopsy rates (per 1000episodes) doubled (57.1; 95% CI, 50.3-65.1) following MRI compared withmammography (23.6; 95% CI, 22.4-24.8) in women with PHBC. Differences (per 1000episodes) were even larger in women without PHBC: 84.7 (95% CI, 75.9-94.9)following MRI and 14.9 (95% CI, 14.7-15.0) following mammography episodes. Ductalcarcinoma in situ and invasive biopsy yield (per 1000 episodes) was significantlyhigher following mammography compared with MRI episodes in women with PHBC(mammography, 404.6; 95% CI, 381.2-428.8; MRI, 267.6; 95% CI, 208.0-337.8) andnonsignificantly higher, but in the same direction, in women without PHBC(mammography, 279.3; 95% CI, 274.2-284.4; MRI, 214.6; 95% CI, 158.7-280.8).High-risk benign lesions were more commonly identified following MRI regardlessof PHBC. Higher biopsy rates and lower cancer yield following MRI were notexplained by increasing age or higher 5-year breast cancer risk.Conclusions and Relevance: Women with and without PHBC who undergo screening MRI experience higher biopsy rates coupled with significantly lower cancer yieldfindings following biopsy compared with screening mammography alone. Further workis needed to identify women who will benefit from screening MRI to ensure anacceptable benefit-to-harm ratio.DOI: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.8549 PMCID: PMC5876894 [Available on 2019-02-12]PMID: 29435556
