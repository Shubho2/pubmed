[Epub ahead ofprint]Specific Features of Transcription Activity of Cancer-Testis Antigens in Patientswith Metastatic and Non-Metastatic Breast Cancer.Vodolazhsky DI(1), Kutilin DS(2), Mogushkova KA(1), Kit OI(1).Author information: (1)Rostov Research Institute of Oncology, Ministry of Health of the RussianFederation, Rostov-on-Don, Russia.(2)Rostov Research Institute of Oncology, Ministry of Health of the RussianFederation, Rostov-on-Don, Russia. k.denees@yandex.ru.Cancer-testis antigens, effective markers of tissue malignant transformation, arecharacterized by heterogonous transcription depending on the pathologicalfeatures of breast cancer. We performed screening of transcription profile ofcancer-testis antigens specific for breast tumor tissues in female patients with and without regional metastasis. The relative expression of 16 genes (MAGEA1,MAGEA2, MAGEA3, MAGEA4, MAGEB1, MAGEB2, GAGE1, GAGE3, GAGE4, MAGEC1, BAGE, XAGE3,NY-ESO1, SSX2, SYCP1, and PRAME1) was analyzed by RT-qPCR method in biopsyspecimens of the mammary gland tissues obtained during surgery from 25 patients. Differential transcription activity of cancer-testis antigens genes was observed in patients with metastatic (enhanced expression of MAGEA2, MAGEB1, and XAGE3genes) and non-metastatic (enhanced expression of GAGE3 and PRAME1 genes) breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10517-018-4175-x PMID: 30006881
