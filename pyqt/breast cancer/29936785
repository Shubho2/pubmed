There is many models for survival analysis of patients such asCox PH model, Parametric models etc. But some disease are that all of patientswill not experience main event then usual survival model is inappropriate. Inaddition, In the presence of cured patients, if researcher can specifydistribution of survival time, usually cure rate models are preferable toparametric models. Distribution of Survival time can be Weibull, Log normal,Logistic, Gamma and so. Comparison of Weibull, Log normal and Logisticdistribution for finding the best distribution of survival time is purpose ofthis study. Material and Methods: Among 787 patients with BC by Cancer ResearchCenter recognized and followed from 1985 until 2013. Variables stage of cancer,age at diagnosis, tumor size and Number of Removed Positive Lymph Nodes (NRPLN)for fitting Cure rate model were selected. The best model selected with DICcriteria. All analysis were performed using SAS 9.2. Results: Mean (SD) of agewas 48.47 (11.49) years and Mean of survival time and Maximum follow up time was 326 and 55.12 months respectively. During following patients, 145 (18.4%)patients died from BC and others survived (censored). Also, 1-year, 5-year and10-year survival rate was 94, 77 and 56 percent respectively. Log normal modelwith smaller DIC were selected and fitted. All of mentioned variables in themodel were significant on cure rate. Conclusion: This study indicated thatsurvival time of BC followed from Log normal distribution in the best way.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.6.1601 PMID: 29936785
