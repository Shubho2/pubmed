Electronic address: gimpl@uni-mainz.de.The oxytocin receptor, a class A G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), isessentially involved in the physiology of reproduction. Two parameters arecrucially important to support high-affinity agonist binding of the receptor:Mg2+ and cholesterol, both acting as positive modulators. Using displacementassays with a high-affinity fluorescent antagonist (OTAN-A647), we now show that sodium functions as a negative allosteric modulator of the oxytocin receptor. In membranes from HEK293 cells stably expressing the oxytocin receptor, oxytocinbinding occurred with about 15-fold lower affinity when sodium chloride wasincreased from 0 to 300 mM, whereas antagonist binding remained largelyunchanged. The effect was concentration-dependent, sodium-specific, and it wasalso observed for oxytocin receptors endogenously expressed in Hs578T breastcancer cells. A conserved Asp (Asp 85) is known to stabilize the sodium bindingsite in other GCPRs. Mutations of this residue into Ala or Asn are known to yieldnon-functional oxytocin receptors. When Asp 85 was exchanged for Glu, most of theoxytocin receptors were localized in intracellular structures, but a faint plasmamembrane labeling with OTAN-A647 and the appearance of oxytocin-induced calciumresponses indicated that these receptors were functional. However, a sodiumeffect was not detectable for the mutant D85E oxytocin receptors. Thus, theoxytocin receptor is allosterically controlled by sodium similar to other GPCRs, but it behaves differently concerning the involvement of the conserved Asp 85. Incase of the oxytocin receptor, Asp 85 is obviously essential for properlocalization in the plasma membrane.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
