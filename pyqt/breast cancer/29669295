Wereport the generation of a quantitative chemical-genetic interaction map in humanmammary epithelial cells charting the impact of the knockdown of 625 genesrelated to cancer and DNA repair on sensitivity to 29 drugs, covering all classesof chemotherapy. This quantitative map is predictive of interactions maintainedin other cell lines, identifies DNA-repair factors, predicts cancer cell lineresponses to therapy, and prioritizes synergistic drug combinations. We identify that ARID1A loss confers resistance to PARP inhibitors in cells and ovariancancer patients and that loss of GPBP1 causes resistance to cisplatin and PARPinhibitors through the regulation of genes involved in homologous recombination. This map helps navigate patient genomic data and optimize chemotherapeuticregimens by delineating factors involved in the response to specific types of DNAdamage.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
