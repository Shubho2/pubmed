Eleven Japanese patients who received carbon-ion radiotherapyfor breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The original clinical plans wereused for the passive irradiation method, while the plans for the scanningirradiation method were more recently made. Statistical analysis suggested thatthere was no significant difference in superiority in terms of dose distribution between the passive and scanning irradiation methods. The present study foundthat the scanning irradiation method was not always superior to the passivemethod, despite a previous study having reported the superiority of scanningirradiation. The present result is considered to arise from characteristics ofbreast cancer treatment, such as the simplicity of the organ at risk and theshallow depth point of the target from the skin. It is noteworthy that thepresent study suggests that the passive irradiation method can provide betterdose distribution, depending on the case.DOI: 10.1093/jrr/rry052 PMID: 30010816
