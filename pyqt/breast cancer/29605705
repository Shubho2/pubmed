Procedures including ALND were identified using CPT codes. This number was divided by total cases, given a varying number of participating institutions eachyear. Next, cases involving resident participation were identified and divided bytraining level: junior (post graduate year-[PGY] 1-2), senior (PGY 3-5) andfellow (PGY ≥ 6). Two tailed z tests were used to compare proportions, withsignificance determined when p < 0.05.RESULTS: A total of 128,372 women were identified with IBC with 36,844 ALND. ALNDrates decreased by an average of 2.43% yearly from 2007 to 2014. Residentparticipation significantly drops in 2011, from 49.3% before to 29.4% after (p < 0.01). Junior residents experienced a significant decrease in participation rate (43.3%-32.2%, p < 0.05). Senior residents and fellows experienced an upward trendin their participation, although not significant (51.2%-56.3%, p = 0.35, and5.6%-11.6%, p = 0.056, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Using the ACS-NSQIP database, we demonstrate the downward trend inrate of ALND for IBC with subsequent decrease in resident participation. Juniorresidents experienced a significant decrease in their participation with nosignificant change for senior or fellow-level trainees. Awareness of this trendis important when creating future surgical curriculum changes for general surgeryand fellowship training programs.Copyright © 2018 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.
