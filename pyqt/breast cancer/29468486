Immunohistochemicalstaining of CD68 and CD163 was performed, and the infiltrating macrophages andCLSs within breast adipose tissue were evaluated.RESULTS: Group 3 had the largest number of CD68-positive (CD68+) andCD163-positive (CD163+) macrophages and CLSs within adipose tissue (P < 0.001).Among Group 3, cases with high levels of CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages commonlyhad a higher histologic grade (P = 0.016 and P = 0.045), and cases with CD163+CLSs were correlated with old age (P = 0.042), estrogen receptor negativity(P = 0.013), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positivity (P = 0.043), andnon-luminal A type (P = 0.039). Upon univariate analysis, high levels of CD163+macrophages were associated with shorter disease-free survival in node-negativebreast cancer patients (P = 0.033), and CD68+ CLSs were associated with shorteroverall survival in node-positive breast cancer patients (P = 0.015).CONCLUSIONS: CD68+ and/or CD163+ tumor-associated macrophage infiltration as wellas CLSs are present in adipose tissue nearby the breast cancer lesion, and areassociated with various clinicopathologic parameters of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4722-1 PMID: 29468486
