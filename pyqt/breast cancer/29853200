Screening is aprobabilistic approach, which, in order to serve the needs of a few, involves thelargest number to share the potential harmful effects. Improvement of scientific knowledge and opening of the societal debate modified the relation betweencollective and individual stakes over time. This article traces the evolution of the discourse surrounding cancer screening, particularly following thecontroversy surrounding breast cancer screening. Within the framework of a healthpolicy, screening leads in the first place to a collective benefit and second, toan individual benefit. It describes how, within the French context, the debatehas induced a complete re-examination of the modalities of information andconsent leading to a shift from the promotion of screening to more balancedinformation on benefits and risks, so that people can decide whether toparticipate in a more informed way.Copyright © 2018 Société Française du Cancer.
