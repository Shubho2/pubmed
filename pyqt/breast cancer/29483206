Small-molecule inhibitors of CDK4/6 have shown promise in thistumor type in combination with hormonal therapies, reflecting the particulardependence of this subtype of cancer on cyclin D1 and E2F transcription factors. mTOR inhibitors have also shown potential in clinical trials in this diseasesetting. Recent data have suggested cooperation between the PI3K/mTOR pathway andCDK4/6 inhibition in preventing early adaptation and eliciting growth arrest, butthe mechanisms of the interplay between these pathways have not been fullyelucidated. Here we show that profound and durable inhibition of ER+ breastcancer growth is likely to require multiple hits on E2F-mediated transcription.We demonstrate that inhibition of mTORC1/2 does not affect ER function directly, but does cause a decrease in cyclin D1 protein, RB phosphorylation, andE2F-mediated transcription. Combination of an mTORC1/2 inhibitor with a CDK4/6inhibitor results in more profound effects on E2F-dependent transcription, which translates into more durable growth arrest and a delay in the onset ofresistance. Combined inhibition of mTORC1/2, CDK4/6, and ER delivers even moreprofound and durable regressions in breast cancer cell lines and xenografts.Furthermore, we show that CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant cell lines reactivate theCDK-RB-E2F pathway, but remain sensitive to mTORC1/2 inhibition, suggesting that mTORC1/2 inhibitors may represent an option for patients that have relapsed onCDK4/6 therapy.
