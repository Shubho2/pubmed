The molecular mechanismsunderpinning this relationship are yet to be elucidated; however, this reviewexamines the available evidence suggesting that the metabolic abnormalitiesobserved in type 2 diabetes can predispose to the development of breast cancer.Alterations in substrate availability and the hormonal milieu, particularlyhyperinsulinemia, not only create a favorable metabolic environment fortumorigenesis, but also induce metabolic reprogramming events that are requiredfor the transformation of breast cancer cells. In addition, the dysfunction andhypoxia of adipose tissue surrounding the breast cancer niche is another putativelink that will be discussed. Finally, the mechanisms by which breast cancer cellsevade checkpoints associated with nutrient overload will be examined.Experimentally validating these potential links will be important for prediction and treatment of breast cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes.Â© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/JOE-18-0037 PMID: 29487204
