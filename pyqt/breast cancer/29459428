Recent studyrevealed that hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress is involved in theacceleration of tumor metastasis. We used model of high-dosestreptozotocin-induced diabetes to investigate its effect on tumor growth andmodulation of antitumor immune response of 4T1 murine breast cancer in BALB/cmice. Diabetes accelerated tumor appearance, growth and weight, which wasassociated with decreased NK cells cytotoxicity against 4T1 tumor cells in vitro Diabetes reduced frequencies of systemic NKG2D+, perforin+, granzyme+, IFN-γ+ andIL-17+ NK cells, while increased level of PD-1 expression and production of IL-10in NK cells. Diabetes decreased percentage of NKG2D+NK cells and increasedpercentage of PD-1+ NK cells also in primary tumor. Diabetes increasedaccumulation of IL-10+ Tregs and TGF-β+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in spleen and tumor. Diabetic sera in vitro significantly increased thepercentage of KLRG-1+ and PD-1+ NK cells, decreased the percentage of IFN-γ+NKcells, expression of NKp46 and production of perforin, granzyme, CD107a and IL-17per NK cell in comparison to glucose-added mouse sera and control sera.Significantly increased percentages of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) andindoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) producing MDSCs and dendritic cells (DC) werefound in the spleens of diabetic mice prior to tumor induction.1-methyl-DL-tryptophan, specific IDO inhibitor, almost completely restoredphenotype of NK cells cultivated in diabetic sera. These findings indicate thatdiabetes promotes breast cancer growth at least in part through increasedaccumulation of immunosuppressive cells and IDO-mediated attenuation of NK cells.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-17-0529 PMID: 29459428
