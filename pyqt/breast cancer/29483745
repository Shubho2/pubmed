Eclipse planning system was used to design volumetric rotatingintensity-modulated (2F-RapidArc) and two field intensity-modulated radiationtherapy (2F-IMRT) planning for each patient. 2F-RapidArc plans were made usingtwo partial arcs with gantry rotation from 287°-293° to 152°-162°, and 0° to 90 °was avoidance sector. The gantry angle of 2F-IMRT were 301°-311° and 125°-135°.The prescription dose was 46 Gy/23 fractions. All plans required 95% of thetarget volume receiving the prescription dose. The dose distribution of thetarget, organs at risk, machine unit (MU) and treatment time were compared.RESULTS: 2F-RapidArc and 2F-IMRT plans' uniformity index was 1.12±0.02 and1.11±0.03 (P=0.282), respectively; conformal index was 0.80±0.03 and 0.65±0.04(P<0.001), respectively. V110 of plan target volume was 20.98%±14.47% and10.43%±10.49% (P=0.030), respectively. Compared with the 2F-IMRT, 2F-RapidArcplans had a higher dosimetric parameters for left lung: V5 (48.06%±17.32% vs.24.23%±6.56%,P=0.001), V10 (28.89±9.28 vs.17.07±4.78%,P=0.004), Dmean[(9.70±2.14) Gy vs. (6.86±1.77) Gy, P=0.002], increased the double lung: V5(22.85%±7.55% vs. 11.01%± 2.95%,P=0.001), V10 (13.16%±4.33% vs. 7.76%± 2.16%,P=0.006), Dmean [(4.66±0.95) Gy vs. (3.17±0.82) Gy, P=0.001], reduced the leftlung: V40 (3.58%±1.46% vs. 6.19%±3.04%, P=0.006), reduced the double lung: V40(1.61%±0.64% vs. 2.81%± 1.39%,P=0.005), increased cardiac: V5 (39.3%±17.19% vs.8.79%±4.24%, P<0.001), V10 (21.31%±13.8% vs. 5.73%±3.42%, P=0.002), V20(7.80%±6.08% vs. 4.05%±2.85%,P=0.018), Dmean [(0.64±0.25) Gy vs. (0.29±1.39)Gy,P<0.001],reduced the heart: V40(0.50%±0.40% vs. 1.86%±1.94%,P=0.037),increasedthe contralateral breast Dmean [(1.63±1.26) Gy vs. (0.09±0.05) Gy, P=0.004].Compared with 2F-IMRTplan, 2F-RapidArc increased the treatment time [(132.9±7.2) s vs. (140.3±11.6) s, P=0.030]. Both the machine units were almost the same[(467.0±30.4) MU vs. (494.7±44.9) MU, P=0.094].CONCLUSION: Both 2F-RapidArc and 2F-IMRT plans could reach the clinicalrequirements. 2F-RapidArc had a better conformal index, reduced the high dosearea, but increased the low dose regions of the lung, heart, body area, andincreased the average dose of the contralateral breast. The treatment time of2F-RapidArc was longer than that of 2F-IMRT, and the MU of 2F-RapidArc and2F-IMRT plans were almost the same.PMID: 29483745
