Electronic address: natercia@ff.up.pt.The leading cause of cancer death in women around the world is breast cancer. Thearomatase inhibitors (AIs) are considered - as first-line treatment for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast tumors, in postmenopausal women. Exemestane (Exe) is a powerful steroidal AI, however, despite its therapeutic success,Exe-acquired resistance may occur leading to tumor relapse. Our group previously demonstrated that autophagy acts as a pro-survival process in Exe-induced celldeath of ER+ sensitive breast cancer cells. In this work, the role of autophagyand its relationship with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in Exe-acquired resistancewas explored. In that way, the mechanism behind the effects of the combination ofExe with pan-PI3K, or autophagic inhibitors, was studied in a long-term estrogen deprived ER+ breast cancer cell line (LTEDaro cells). Our results indicate thatExe induces autophagy as a cytoprotective mechanism linked to acquiredresistance. Moreover, it was demonstrated that by inhibiting autophagy and/orPI3K pathway it is possible to revert Exe-resistance through apoptosis promotion,disruption of cell cycle, and inhibition of cell survival pathways. This workprovides new insights into the mechanisms involved in Exe-acquired resistance,pointing autophagy as an attractive therapeutic target to surpass it. Thus, ithighlights new targets that together with aromatase inhibition may improve ER+breast cancer therapy, overcoming AIs-acquired resistance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
