Our objective was toconduct a systematic review of the association between dietary patterns andbreast cancer risk.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The original articles included, were published betweenJanuary 2013 and May 2017 and characterized diets using a priori and posterioriapproaches to examine associations between dietary patterns and breast cancerrisk. A novel scoring matrix was used to grade posteriori dietary patternalignment with the American Cancer Society dietary guidelines.RESULTS: Seventeen case-control and nested case-control studies identified 15healthy, and 10 unhealthy, dietary patterns determined posteriori, and 7 dietary indices determined a priori. Vegetables were consistently found in breast cancer protective patterns whereas saturated fat and red and processed meats wereconsistently found in patterns associated with increased breast cancer risk.CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that dietary patterns that include vegetables andlimit saturated fat and red and processed meats may lower breast cancer risk.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12586 PMID: 29848668  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
