[Epub ahead of print]Training Community Health Workers in Motivational Interviewing to Promote Cancer Screening.Brandford A(1), Adegboyega A(1), Combs B(1), Hatcher J(1).Author information: (1)1 University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA.Health disparities researchers attempting to engage and effectively deliverinterventions to underserved populations often encounter a number of challengesranging from geographical considerations to more complex issues of medicalmistrust. While there are a number of strategies researchers may employ toaddress these challenges, one of the most successful of these has been the use ofcommunity health workers (CHWs). Despite the documented success of CHWs, littleinformation exists on the use of theory-driven intervention strategies with thesecommunity partners. Researchers who have partnered with CHWs tend to providebrief descriptions of training strategies and provide little discussion of thechallenges and barriers to training a lay population in the delivery of technicalinterventions, including ensuring fidelity to the intervention protocol. Thepurpose of this article is to describe the feasibility of training CHWs todeliver a motivational interviewing intervention to promote cancer screening inunderserved populations. With this article we present an innovative way to usemotivational interviewing delivered by CHWs. Specifically, we will detail thedevelopment of the training protocol, the implementation of that training in avariety of research settings, and the development and implementation of fidelity protocols. We will use examples from two research studies where CHWs weresuccessfully trained to use MI to promote cancer screening in underservedcommunities to highlight the challenges and barriers faced in developing andimplementing the training and strategies used to overcome these challenges duringthe refinement of the intervention.DOI: 10.1177/1524839918761384 PMID: 29577772
