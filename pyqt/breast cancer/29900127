Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square tests,Kaplan-Meier analyses, Cox proportional hazards models, and a 1:1 propensityscore matching (PSM).Results: Before PSM, a total of 1,475 patients with tumor size ≤2 cm,node-negative disease, and estrogen receptor-positive disease were identified,including 927 (62.8%) underwent postoperative RT and 548 (37.2%) hadpostoperative omission of RT. The administration of postoperative RT steadilydeclined over the study period. Patients with younger age, larger tumor size, andother race/ethnicity were more likely to receive postoperative RT. The medianfollow-up duration was 85.0 months, the 5- and 10-year BCSS rates were 98.7 and97.9%, respectively. The median BCSS was 161.9 and 165.0 months for patients withand without postoperative RT, respectively, and the corresponding 5-year BCSSrates were 98.5 and 98.8%, respectively (p = 0.134). Prognostic analysisindicated that postoperative RT was not associated with improved BCSS ratescompared with RT omission (p = 0.134). After PSM, a total of 431 complete pairswere generated. In the matched population, the 5-year BCSS rates were 98.6 and98.4% in non-postoperative RT and postoperative RT groups, respectively(p = 0.858). The univariate analyses also confirmed that the administration ofpostoperative RT was not associated with better BCSS (p = 0.858).Conclusion: The incidence of breast cancer-related death is probably sufficientlylow to avoid postoperative RT in women aged ≥65 years with TC of the breast afterBCS.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00190 PMCID: PMC5988847PMID: 29900127
