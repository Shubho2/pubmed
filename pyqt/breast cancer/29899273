In thepresent work, five benzo[a]phenoxazinium derivatives have been prepared andevaluated for their in vitro anticancer photodynamic activity for the first time.They are red light absorbers and show low fluorescence quantum yield. Of thesecompounds, PS4 exhibited a higher quantum yield for reactive oxygen species (ROS)generation. The assays with cells in vitro showed that PS1 and PS4 were notsignificantly toxic in the dark, but was robustly toxic against the murine breastadenocarcinoma cells 4T1 and normal murine fibroblast cells NIH-3T3 uponphotoactivation. More interestingly, PS5 was particularly selective towards 4T1cancer cells and nearly non-phototoxic to non-cancerous NIH-3T3 cells. Theresults described in this report suggest that these new benzo[a]phenoxaziniumderivatives are potential candidates as PSs for anticancer PDT. Furtherinvestigation of benzo[a]phenoxaziniums for anticancer PDT is warranted.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23061436 PMID: 29899273
