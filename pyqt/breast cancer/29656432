Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been thought toincrease the risk of cancer by inhibiting calcium signal-mediated apoptosis, but the evidence for this association remains inconclusive. We have reviewedpertinent literature and pooled data to establish a consensus on the relationshipof CCB use and the incidence of these two cancers.METHODS: PubMed was used to conduct a search for English articles from inception to April 2016. Relevant data including study design, number of total participantsand CCB users, total cases of BCa and PCa, age (mean and/or range), follow-upperiod and statistical outcomes were retrieved. Quality assessment was carriedout using Newcastle Ottawa system, with the selection of high-quality studies.Summary effects were obtained using random- and mixed-effects models, followed bysensitivity analysis, and testing for publication bias.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This meta-analysis includes 11 relevant studies for BCaand 6 for PCa. The odds ratio (OR) association between BCa and CCB use was 1.14(95%CI: 1.02, 1.27, P = .02). The OR association between PCa and CCB use was 1.12(95%CI .94-1.35, P = .21).WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Although a statistically significant associationbetween CCB use and incidence of BCa does exist, the limitations of theindividual studies restrict the clinical application of this relationship. Ourmeta-regression model does newly identify a 9-year latency period of CCB use and a significantly increased risk of BCa. No significant association exists between CCB use and the incidence of PCa. Our meta-regression shows CCB may have aprotective effect upon PCa incidence among older populations.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/jcpt.12673 PMID: 29656432
