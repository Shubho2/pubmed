Currently, some molecular markers are in use for breastcancer diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive purposes. Thus, genetic signatures are available for improving the decision-making. The biomarkers are alsoessential as therapeutic approaches, but many questions remain due to the lack ofefficacy on breast cancer treatment, mainly for triple-negative breast cancersubtype. Since the genetic profile of breast cancer can also be related todifferent ethnic groups and geographic areas, the reference populations of thegenetic assays and clinical trials need to include a broader population beyondthe European and North American patients. In this review, we analyzed the currentand potential molecular markers that could help to improve the strategies forbreast cancer therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
