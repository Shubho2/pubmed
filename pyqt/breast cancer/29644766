Descriptive statistics and multivariate logisticregression models were used to assess the association of demographic, clinical,and quality of life variables with survivors' FCR, dichotomized as <14 (low) or≥14 (high) using the Cancer Worry Scale.RESULTS: Out of the 4259 participants, 3124 (73.3%) were diagnosed with breastcancer, 559 (13.1%) with colorectal cancer, 493 (11.6%) with endometrial cancer, and 83 (2%) with ovarian cancer. There were no significant differences in FCR by cancer type (P = .75), with a mean scale score of 10.8 ± 2.87 for allparticipants combined. Approximately 16% (n = 679) were in the high FCR group.Multivariable analyses indicated that being younger at diagnosis, reporting asymptom score of ≥8, receipt of chemotherapy, and lower self-rated health weresignificantly associated with high FCR. Women who were widowed or never marriedwere less likely to report high FCR.CONCLUSIONS: Fear of recurrence was experienced by a small but importantproportion of older, long-term cancer survivors and is associated with multipledemographic and clinical variables. These results will better inform researchers and clinicians regarding the individuals who are at risk of FCR.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4731 PMID: 29644766
