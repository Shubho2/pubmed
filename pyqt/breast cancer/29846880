[Epub ahead of print]The uptake of presymptomatic genetic testing in hereditary breast-ovarian cancer and Lynch syndrome: a systematic review of the literature and implications forclinical practice.Menko FH(1), Ter Stege JA(2), van der Kolk LE(3), Jeanson KN(3), Schats W(4),Moha DA(3), Bleiker EMA(2).Author information: (1)Family Cancer Clinic, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital and The NetherlandsCancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. f.menko@nki.nl.(2)Department of Psychosocial Research and Epidemiology, Antoni van LeeuwenhoekHospital and The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.(3)Family Cancer Clinic, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital and The NetherlandsCancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.(4)Department of Scientific Information Service, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital and The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.Following the identification in a proband of a germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation inhereditary breast-ovarian cancer (HBOC) or a DNA mismatch repair gene mutation inLynch syndrome (LS) he or she will be asked to inform at-risk family membersabout the option for presymptomatic DNA testing. However, in clinical practicemultiple factors may complicate the process of information sharing. We criticallyevaluated studies on the uptake of presymptomatic genetic testing in bothsyndromes. A search of relevant MeSH terms and key words in PubMed, Embase andPsycINFO yielded 795 articles published between 2001 and 2017. Thirty of thesepublications included outcome measures relevant for the current study. Based oninformation provided by the proband (15 studies) the uptake of presymptomaticgenetic testing ranged from 15 to 57% in HBOC, while one study in LS kindredsreported an uptake of 70%. Based on information provided by genetics centres (theremaining 15 studies) the uptake ranged from 21 to 44% in HBOC and from 41 to 94%in LS. However, when genetics centres contacted relatives directly a substantial number of additional family members could be tested. Proband-mediated provisionof information to at-risk relatives is a standard procedure in hereditarybreast-ovarian cancer and Lynch syndrome. However, the resulting uptake ofpresymptomatic testing is disappointing-an issue that is now urgent due to theincreased use of genetic testing in clinical oncology. We propose that additionalstrategies should be introduced including the geneticist directly contactingrelatives. The outcomes of these strategies should be carefully monitored andevaluated.DOI: 10.1007/s10689-018-0089-z PMID: 29846880
