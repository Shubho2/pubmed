Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4) promotes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated withcancer chemoresistance. This study aims to explore the effect of TLR4 in PTXresistance in triple-negative BCA and advanced melanoma and the effect ofcompound A (CpdA) to attenuate this resistance.METHODS: BCA and melanoma cell lines were checked for the response to PTX bycytotoxic assay. The response to PTX of TLR4-transient knockdown cells by siRNAtransfection was evaluated compared to the control cells. Levels ofpro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, and anti-apoptotic protein, XIAP were measured by real-time PCR whereas the secreted IL-8 was quantitated by ELISA inTLR4-transient knockdown cancer cells with or without CpdA treatment. Theapoptotic cells after adding PTX alone or in combination with CpdA were detected by caspase-3/7 assay.RESULTS: PTX could markedly induce TLR4 expression in both MDA-MB-231 BCA andMDA-MB-435 melanoma cell lines having a basal level of TLR4 whereas nosignificant induction in TLR4-transient knockdown cells occurred. ThesiTLR4-treated BCA cells revealed more dead cells after PTX treatment than thatof mock control cells. IL-6, IL-8 and XIAP showed increased expressions inPTX-treated cells and this over-production effect was inhibited in TLR4-transientknockdown cells. Apoptotic cells were detected higher when PTX and CpdA werecombined than PTX treatment alone. Isobologram exhibited the synergistic effectof CpdA and PTX. CpdA could significantly decrease expressions of IL-6, XIAP and IL-8, as well as excreted IL-8 levels together with reduced cancer viabilityafter PTX treatment.CONCLUSIONS: The acquired TLR4-mediated PTX resistance in BCA and melanoma isexplained partly by the paracrine effect of IL-6 and IL-8 released into the tumormicroenvironment and over-production of anti-apoptotic protein, XIAP, in BCAcells and importantly CpdA could reduce this effect and sensitize PTX-inducedapoptosis in a synergistic manner. In conclusion, the possible impact ofTLR4-dependent signaling pathway in PTX resistance in BCA and melanoma isproposed and using PTX in combination with CpdA may attenuate TLR4-mediated PTXresistance in the treatment of the patients.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4155-6 PMCID: PMC5830047PMID: 29486738
