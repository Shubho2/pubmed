Phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of PDH is a relevant event in this process, but it is not durable as it relies on PDH kinases that are activated ordinarilyunder hypoxic conditions. Thus, it remains unclear how PDH is durablydownregulated in cancer cells that are not hypoxic. Building on evidence that PDHactivity depends on the stability of a multi-protein PDH complex, we found thatthe PDH-E1β subunit of the PDH complex is downregulated to inhibit PDH activityunder conditions of prolonged hypoxia. After restoration of normoxic conditions, reduced expression of PDH-E1β was sustained such that glycolysis remained highly activated. Notably, PDH-E1β silencing in cancer cells produced a metabolic state strongly resembling the Warburg effect, but inhibited tumor growth. Conversely,enforced exogenous expression of PDH-E1β durably increased PDH activity andpromoted the malignant growth of breast cancer cells in vivo Taken together, our results establish the specific mechanism through which PDH acts as an oncogenicfactor by tuning glycolytic metabolism in cancer cells.Significance: This seminalstudy offers a mechanistic explanation for why glycolysis is aberrantly activatedin normoxic cancer cells, offering insights into this long-standing hallmark ofcancer termed the Warburg effect.
