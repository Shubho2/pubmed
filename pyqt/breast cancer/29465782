In this study, we investigated microwave parameters as apotential non-invasive approach to detect breast cancer.METHODS: Samples of freshly excised breast tissues (n = 509) from 98 patientswere identified as normal, benign tumor, or malignant cancer via histology.Further samples were prepared and the microwave effective dielectric permittivityand effective conductivity were measured every 0.0375 GHz from 0.5 GHz to 8 GHz. These parameters were compared among the breast tissue types.RESULTS: The effective relative permittivity and effective conductivity at eachfrequency was significantly higher in breast cancer tissues compared with benign tumors, which in turn was significantly higher than in normal breast tissue. The standard deviation of each parameter was narrowest at ~2.5 GHz in both normal andmalignant breast tissues.CONCLUSIONS: The effective dielectric permittivity and effective conductivity,measured via microwave technology, could differentiate breast cancer from normal and benign tumor tissues.© 2018 The Authors.
