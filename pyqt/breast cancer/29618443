The objective of this work was to demonstrate directradiolabeling of epirubicin with 99mTc, quality control, biologicalcharacterization and scientigraphic evaluation in tumor bearing mice. The99mTc-epirubicin labeling was optimized by varying the amounts of ligand100-350μg, stannous chloride dihydride 20-50μg and pH range 2-10 by using NaOH orHCl. The radiochemical purity of 99mTc-epirubicin was evaluated bychromatographic techniques (Whatman No. 3 paper and ITLC-SG). HPLC analyses were performed to check purity of epirubicin and radiochemical purity of labeled99mTc- epirubicin. Biodistribution and scintigraphic imaging of 99mTc-epirubicin was performed in normal and tumor bearing mice at various time intervals. Theoptimum conditions ensuring 99mTc-epirubicin labeling yield as high as 99% byadding 35μg SnCl2.2H2O, 200μg of ligand at pH 6 for 30 min at room temperature(25°C±2°C). HPLC of 99mTc-epirubicin shows about 99% binding of the compound withtechnetium-99m. Electrophoresis study indicated the neutral nature of99mTc-epirubicin. Biodistribution data and scintigraphic results showed that99mTc-epirubicin accumulated in the liver as well as in tumor with significantuptake and excellent retention. 99mTc-epirubicin shows good stability in humanserum. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed the significantly uptake of99mTc-epirubicin in the tumor, and also indicating the efficiency of99mTc-epirubicin as a tumor diagnostic agent.PMID: 29618443
