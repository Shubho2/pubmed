China.A total of 60 breast cancer (BC) tissues and adjacent healthy tissues frompatients who underwent surgery in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University werecollected for analysis in the present study. Results from reversetranscription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) demonstrated that,compared with the adjacent healthy tissues, the expression levels of microRNA(miR)‑142‑5p were significantly elevated in BC tissues. Bioinformatics analysiswas performed using TargetScan for the prediction of potential target sites that matched the seed region of miR‑142‑5p; phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)exhibited the highest score and was selected for further analysis. Results ofRT‑qPCR analysis demonstrated that, compared with the adjacent healthy tissues,the mRNA expression levels of PTEN were significantly decreased in breast cancer tissues. miR‑142‑5p and PTEN expression levels were positively and negativelyassociated, respectively, with patient tumor size and metastasis. MDA‑MB‑231cells were divided into three groups including the Control group, the miR‑NCinhibitor group and the miR‑142‑5p inhibitor group. As for alterations in cellbehavior, including cell viability and cell apoptosis, and protein expressionlevels, there were no significant differences between Control and miR‑NCinhibitor groups. MTT assay results revealed that, compared with Control andmiR‑NC inhibitor groups, miR‑142‑5p inhibitor reduced MDA‑MB‑231 cellproliferation. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that, compared with Control and miR‑NC inhibitor groups, miR‑142‑5p inhibitor treatment induced MDA‑MB‑231cell apoptosis. Western blotting results demonstrated that, compared with Controland miR‑NC inhibitor groups, miR‑142‑5p inhibitor treatment significantlyincreased the expression of PTEN, reduced the activation ofphosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase/RACα serine/threonine‑proteinkinase signaling. Finally, PTEN was demonstrated to interact with miR‑142‑5p fromthe results of dual‑luciferase reporter assay in the present study. The findings of the present study suggested that miR‑142‑5p may be a potential therapeutictarget for the future investigations and insights for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8812 PMCID: PMC5983952PMID: 29620260
