Electronic address: weixue_jnu@aliyun.com.Antitumor efficacy of ursolic acid (UA) is seriously limited due to its lowhydrophilicity and needy bioavailability. To overcome these obstacles,chemosensitive polyspermine (CPSP) conjugated with UA and folic acid (FA) as anovel targeted prodrug was designed and successfully synthesized in thisinvestigation. This prodrug not only showed high aqueous solubility,GSH-triggered degradation and good biocompatibility, but also exhibited betterinhibition effect on the tumor cells proliferation in comparison with free UA.FA-CPSP-UA could down-regulate the generation of GSH and manifest excellentability in enhancing antitumor efficacy. In addition, FA-CPSP-UA could inhibitthe expression of MMP-9, which led to restricting MCF-7 cells migration. Takentogether, the results indicated that FA-CPSP-UA, as a carrier, can efficientlydeliver UA to folate receptor positive cancer cells and improve tumor therapy of UA by Chemosensitive effect.Copyright Â© 2018.
