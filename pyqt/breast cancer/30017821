Electronic address: bmadison@wustl.edu.Intestinal epithelial stem cell (IESC) fate is promoted by two majortranscriptional regulators, the TCF4/β-catenin complex and ASCL2, which driveexpression of IESC-specific factors, including Lgr5, Ephb2, and Rnf43. Canonical Wnt signaling via TCF4/β-catenin directly transactivates Ascl2, which in turnauto-regulates its own expression. Conversely, Let-7 microRNAs antagonize theIESC lineage by repressing specific mRNA targets. Here, we identify the zincfinger transcription factor PLAGL2 as a Let-7 target that regulates IESC fate.PLAGL2 drives an IESC expression signature, activates Wnt gene expression, andenhances a TCF/LEF reporter in intestinal organoids. In parallel, viacell-autonomous mechanisms, PLAGL2 is required for lineage clonal expansion anddirectly enhances expression of ASCL2. PLAGL2 also supports enteroid growth andsurvival in the context of Wnt ligand depletion. PLAGL2 expression is stronglyassociated with an IESC signature in colorectal cancer and may be responsible forcontributing to the aberrant activation of an immature phenotype.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
