In this study, weanalyzed the OR expression profiles of several different carcinoma tissues, with a focus on breast cancer. The expression of OR2B6 was detectable in breastcarcinoma tissues; here, transcripts of OR2B6 were detected in 73% of all breast carcinoma cell lines and in over 80% of all of the breast carcinoma tissuesanalyzed. Interestingly, there was no expression of OR2B6 observed in healthytissues. Immunohistochemical staining of OR2B6 in breast carcinoma tissuesrevealed a distinct staining pattern of carcinoma cells. Furthermore, we detecteda fusion transcript containing part of the coding exon of OR2B6 as a part of asplice variant of the histone HIST1H2BO transcript. In addition, in cancertissues and cell lines derived from lung, pancreas, and brain, OR expressionpatterns were compared to that of corresponding healthy tissues. The number ofORs detected in lung carcinoma tissues was significantly reduced in comparison tothe surrounding healthy tissues. In pancreatic carcinoma tissues, OR4C6 wasconsiderably more highly expressed in comparison to the respective healthytissues. We detected OR2B6 as a potential biomarker for breast carcinoma tissues.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00033 PMCID: PMC5818398PMID: 29497600
