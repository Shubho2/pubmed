Imaging showed a massmeasuring approximately 5 cm × 4 cm in the right frontal lobe, which also filled the right nasal cavity. Histopathologically, the intracranial tumor tissues were composed of both mature tissues, including glands and squamous epithelial cellsand immature neuroectodermal components. However, the tumor tissues in the nasal cavity were mainly immature neuroectodermal components that mimicked olfactoryneuroblastoma. The cells stained positively for neuron-specific enolase, AlphaThalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked, and Oligodendrocytetranscription factor on immunostaining, proving a neuroectodermaldifferentiation.DIAGNOSES: According to these findings, the tumor was diagnosed as a primaryintracranial immature teratoma that also involved the nasal cavity afterexcluding the metastatic tumors.INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent 2 surgeries. The first surgery was via thesubfrontal approach, followed by a second endoscopic sinus surgery performed 22days later.OUTCOMES: The patient had no recurrence within a 6-month follow-up after the lastsurgery.LESSONS: When an intracranial immature teratoma involves the nasal cavity, thelesions in the nasal cavity may mimic other tumors including olfactoryneuroblastoma. We suggest that thorough examination of tumor tissues andidentification of variable components are critical for the appropriate diagnosis of intracranial immature teratoma, a rare tumor.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011527 PMID: 29995824  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
