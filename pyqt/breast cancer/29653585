Our method was completely automated apart from manual localization of the approximate tumor center. The most enhancing tumor volume (METV) was automatically calculated forthe pre-treatment and early treatment exams. Performance of METV in the task ofpredicting a recurrence was evaluated using ROC analysis. The association ofrecurrence-free survival with METV was assessed using a Cox regression modelcontrolling for patient age, race, and hormone receptor status and evaluated byC-statistics. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate survival functions.RESULTS: The C-statistics for the association of METV with recurrence-freesurvival were 0.69 with 95% confidence interval of [0.58; 0.80] at pre-treatment and 0.72 [0.60; 0.84] at early treatment. The hazard ratios calculated fromKaplan-Meier curves were 2.28 [1.08; 4.61], 3.43 [1.83; 6.75], and 4.81 [2.16;10.72] for the lowest quartile, median quartile, and upper quartile cut-pointsfor METVÂ at early treatment, respectively.CONCLUSION: The performance of the automatically-calculated METV rivaled that of a semi-manual model described for the ACRIN 6657 study (published C-statistic0.72 [0.60; 0.84]), which involved the same dataset but required semi-manualdelineation of the functional tumor volume (FTV) and knowledge of thepre-surgical residual cancer burden.DOI: 10.1186/s40644-018-0145-9 PMCID: PMC5899353PMID: 29653585  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
