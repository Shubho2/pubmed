Intravasation of metastatic cells into blood stream initiated by their invasion to vascular layer would be a significant characteristic of metastasis. Many types of biochemicaland bioelectrical sensors were developed for early detection of metastasis. Thesimplicity of the setup, the ease of the readout, detection of the trace of rare metastatic cells and the feasibility to perform the assay with standardlaboratory equipment are some of the challenges limiting the usability of thesensors in tracing the metastasis. Here we describe a biosensor based on recentlyreported metastatic diagnosis assay; Metas-Chip, with the assistance ofnanoroughened Poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) layer to diagnose populatedmetastatic breast cells from primary cancerous ones. Retraction and detachment ofHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) invaded by metastatic cells as a recently found phenomena is the mechanism of the action. A population of HUVECswould be detached from the gold microelectrodes, patterned on nanoroughenedsurface, which would lead to large changes in impedance. Here, applyingbiocompatible and patternable nanoroughened surface instead of using adhesivelayers which might produce electrical noises resulted in great sensitivity anddetectivity of the sensor. Apart from the tight interaction between endothelialcells and nanocontacts of the electrodes, using low concentration (10%) of tumor cells in this invasion assay, might enhance its application in clinical trials.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
