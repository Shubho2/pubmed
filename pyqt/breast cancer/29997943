However,the mechanisms underlying the benefits of local anesthesia on cancer recurrenceare not well understood.Methods: In this study, we investigated the biological effects of ropivacaine on breast cancer cells and the mechanisms of its action with emphasis onmitochondrial respiration.Results: Ropivacaine significantly inhibited growth, survival, andanchorage-independent colony formation in two human breast cancer cell lines. It also acted synergistically with a 5-FU in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically,ropivacaine was found to inhibit mitochondrial respiration by suppressingmitochondrial respiratory complex I and II activities, leading to energydepletion, and oxidative stress and damage. The inhibitory effects of ropivacainein breast cancer cells were abolished in mitochondrial respiration-deficient œÅ0cells, indicating that mitochondrial respiration is essential for the mechanismof action of ropivacaine. Ropivacaine inhibited phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR,rS6, and EBP1 in breast cancer cells, suggesting the association between Akt/mTORsignaling pathway and mitochondrial functions in breast cancer.Conclusions: Our work clearly demonstrates the inhibitory effects of ropivacaine in breast cancer by disrupting mitochondrial function. Our findings provide aproper understanding of how local anesthetics reduce the risk of tumorrecurrence, and thus, support the use of ropivacaine for surgery and to controlpain in patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.21037/jtd.2018.05.21 PMCID: PMC6006047PMID: 29997943
