[Epub ahead of print]Respiratory Failure Due To Plant Poisoning: Nicotiana glauca Graham.Sercan Y(1), Selahattin KG(1).Author information: (1)Department of Emergency Medicine, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey.BACKGROUND: Cases of human poisoning associated with Nicotiana glauca Graham are quite rare. Patients may consume the plant by mistaking it for spinach or use it as a folk remedy. The toxin stimulates the acetylcholine receptors in the centraland autonomic nervous systems. A prompt and appropriate supportive treatment iscrucial for survival.CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old female with a known breast cancer was brought to ouremergency department (ED) with complaints of nausea and vomiting. The patientstated that her complaints started 2 h after she had cooked and eaten a plant in the hopes that it would help cure her cancer. On the second hour after arrival,the patient became confused. It was observed that the chest wall movements haddecreased and that the patient had difficulty breathing. Due to respiratoryfailure, orotracheal intubation was performed to secure the airway. A sample ofthe plant that was eaten was requested from the patient's relatives. According toan Internet search, the plant sample was identified as N. glauca Graham. Thepatient was diagnosed with N. glauca Graham poisoning. The patient was extubated after 30 h. On 3-month follow-up, the patient was neurologically intact and hadno complaints related to poisoning. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OFTHIS?: Patients with incurable diseases such as cancer tend to try folk remedies and can end up in ED. In patients who present with muscle paralysis andrespiratory failure, emergency physicians should consider N. glauca Graham as acause of plant poisoning.Copyright © 2018.
