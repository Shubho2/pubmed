The present study aimed to evaluate theantitumor potential, describe the cell death mechanism and the effects of3-Heptyl-3,4,6-trimethoxy-3Hisobenzofuran-1-one (AMS35AA) in combination withdifferent chemotherapeutic agents in the MCF-7 cell line.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of cytotoxic, genotoxic, membrane integrity, celldeath and gene expression induced by the compound was performed.RESULTS: The AMS35AA and its association with 5-FU demonstrated reduction of cellviability; increase of cell death; enhancement of genomic damage and accumulationof cells in G2/M phase.CONCLUSION: AMS35AA has potential for breast cancer treatment since it is capableof exerting cytotoxic and cytostatic effects in a breast cell line and also couldbe an adjuvant in cancer therapy when combined with 5-FU.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12761 PMID: 30061223  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
