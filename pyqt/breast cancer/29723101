However, it is exceedingly rare in very young patients, andespecially in adolescents. Herein, we report a case of an 18-year-old femalediagnosed with invasive BC. The proband had been found to be negative for BC inclose family members. A common BC genetic screening test for the Polishpopulation did not detect any known founder mutations in the BRCA1 gene. Further evaluation identified a p.Ile157Thr (I157T) mutation in the CHEK2 gene, ap.Ala1991Val (A1991V) variant of unknown significance in the BRCA2 gene,p.Lys751Gln (K751Q) variant in the XPD (ERCC2) gene, and a homozygousp.Glu1008Ter (E1008*) mutation in the NOD2 gene. No other mutation had been foundby next generation sequencing in major BC high-risk susceptibility genes BRCA1,BRCA2, as well as 92 other genes. To date, all these found alterations have been considered as low to moderate risk factors in the general population and moderaterisk factors in younger women (<35 years of age). There are no previous articles relating low and moderate risk gene mutations to very young onset (below 20years) BC with a fatal outcome. In our patient, a possible cumulative orsynergistic risk effect for these 4 alterations, and a mutation in the NOD2 gene in particular, of which both presumably healthy parents were found to becarriers, is suggested.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2017.1416931 PMCID: PMC5989804 [Available on 2019-05-03]PMID: 29723101
