The aim of this study wasto investigate the role of the X chromosome gain in the development of MBC andits relation with AR gene copy number and expression.The X chromosome status was assessed in 66 cases of male invasive and in situ duct breast carcinoma, in 34cases of gynecomastia associated with cancer, and in 11 cases of tumor-freegynecomastia. Cases were tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) toassess the X chromosome status and AR amplification. AR expression was studied byimmunohistochemistry (IHC). In addition, AR methylation status was assessed.Xchromosome gain was observed in 74.7% of invasive duct carcinoma, in 20.6% of in situ duct carcinoma, and in 14.6% of gynecomastia when associated with cancer,while all cases of tumor-free gynecomastia showed wild X chromosome asset. ARgene copy number when increased paralleled the number of X chromosomes. AR IHCexpression was observed in 100% of MBC tested. AR gene methylation statusrevealed low level or absence of methylation.These data suggest that X chromosomecan play a role in the neoplastic transformation of male breast epithelium. Xchromosome gain is paralleled by AR gene polysomy. Polysomic AR genes show lowmethylation levels and high AR protein expression on IHC. These data should betaken into consideration for MBC treatment planning.DOI: 10.1007/s00428-018-2377-2 PMID: 29802469  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
