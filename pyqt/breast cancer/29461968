However, the underlying mechanisms of this protectiveeffect remain to be fully elucidated. It is unclear whether exercise canattenuate or modify the pro-tumour effects of obesity and related conditions,such as hyperlipidaemia. This review summarises how hyperlipidaemia and exercise contribute to or reduce breast cancer risk and progression, respectively, andhighlights the possible mechanisms behind each. In particular, the effects ofexercise and hyperlipidaemia on the immune microenvironment of tumours isanalysed. The potential value of commonly investigated circulating factors asexercise-modulated, prognostic biomarkers is also discussed. We propose thatexercise may alleviate some of the pro-tumorigenic effects of hyperlipidaemiathrough the reduction of blood lipid levels and modulation of cytokine release toinduce beneficial changes in the tumour microenvironment.Copyright Â© 2016 International Society of Exercise and Immunology.
