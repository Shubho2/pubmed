It serves an important role in the activation ofintegrin, which, in turn, is known to mediate physiological and pathologicalprocesses, including cell adhesion, growth, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. Invertebrates, there are two Talin genes, Talin1 and Talin2. Talin1 is known toregulate focal adhesion dynamics, cell migration and cell invasion; however, the precise role of Talin2 in cancer remains unclear. In the present study, thefunctional role of Talin2 was examined in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line.Talin2 knockdown significantly inhibited growth, migratory capacity andinvasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells, and promoted apoptosis. The expression levelsof Talin2 in breast cancer cells and in the peritumoral normal breast tissueswere also determined by immunohistochemistry. Talin2 was identified to beoverexpressed in breast cancer tissues compared with that in the peritumoralbreast tissues. In addition, the knockdown of Talin2 by specific RNA interferencemarkedly inhibited cell growth, and caused the downregulation of the apoptoticmarkers, cleaved Caspase-3 and phosphorylation of poly ADP-ribose polymerase.These findings demonstrate that Talin2 expression is upregulated in human breast cancer and that downregulation of Talin2 may serve as a useful therapeutic targetin patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8641 PMCID: PMC6006181PMID: 29928413
