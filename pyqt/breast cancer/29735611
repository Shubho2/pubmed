Survivin is the smallest member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosisproteins (IAPs) family, which plays critical roles in cell division and cellsurvival. High expression levels of survivin have been associated withtherapeutic resistance in various cancers. We recently developed a novelsmall-molecule survivin inhibitor mimicking the IAP-binding motif of secondmitochondria-derived activator of caspase, which showed high potency in promotingsurvivin degradation. Here, we show that survivin inhibitor MX106/MX107suppresses TNBC cell proliferation. Moreover, MX106/MX107 synergized withchemotherapeutic drugs or radiation and significantly enhanced tumoricidalefficacy of genotoxic treatments. Mechanistically, MX106/MX107 induceddegradation of XIAP and/or cIAP1, which inhibited nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)activation by genotoxic agents. Treatment with MX106/MX107 alone did not activatealternative NF-κB signaling in breast cancer cells, which is likely attributable to their selective potency in degrading survivin in these cells. In addition,survivin degradation by MX106/MX107 dramatically increased abnormal mitoticspindle formation and cell division failure, which led to cell cycle arrest inbreast cancer cells. Overall, our study suggests that combination treatment ofTNBC using survivin inhibitors MX106/MX107 with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs can achieve significantly improved therapeutic efficacy, which depends onMX106/MX107-mediated inhibition of genotoxic NF-κB activation.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/jpet.118.249151 PMID: 29735611
