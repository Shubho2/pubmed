How the epigenetic reader mediates breast cancer progression remains poorly understood. Here, we showed that the epigenetic reader zinc fingerMYND-type containing 8 (ZMYND8) is induced by HIF-1 and HIF-2 in breast cancercells and also upregulated in human breast tumors, and is correlated with poorsurvival of patients with breast cancer. Genetic deletion of ZMYND8 decreasesbreast cancer cell colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro, andinhibits breast tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs in mice. The ZMYND8'soncogenic effect in breast cancer requires HIF-1 and HIF-2. We further showedthat ZMYND8 interacts with HIF-1α and HIF-2α and enhances elongation of theglobal HIF-induced oncogenic genes by increasing recruitment of BRD4 andsubsequent release of paused RNA polymerase II in breast cancer cells. ZMYND8acetylation at lysines 1007 and 1034 by p300 is required for HIF activation andbreast cancer progression and metastasis. These findings uncover a primaryepigenetic mechanism of HIF activation and HIF-mediated breast cancerprogression, and discover a possible molecular target for the diagnosis andtreatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1172/JCI95089 PMCID: PMC5919820PMID: 29629903
