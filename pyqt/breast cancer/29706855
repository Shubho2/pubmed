Here, a novel type of theranostic agent, bismuth sulfide@mesoporous silica (Bi2S3@ mPS) core-shellnanoparticles (NPs), for targeted image-guided therapy of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) positive breast cancer is developed. To generate suchNPs, polyvinylpyrrolidone decorated rod-like Bi2S3 NPs are chemicallyencapsulated with a mesoporous silica (mPS) layer and loaded with an anticancerdrug, doxorubicin. The resultant NPs are then chemically conjugated withtrastuzumab (Tam, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER-2 overexpressed breastcancer cells) to form Tam-Bi2S3@mPS NPs. By in vitro and in vivo studies, it isdemonstrated that the Tam-Bi2S3@mPS bear multiple desired features for cancertheranostics, including good biocompatibility and drug loading ability as well asprecise and active tumor targeting and accumulation (with a bismuth content intumor being â‰ˆ16 times that of nontargeted group). They can simultaneously serveboth as an excellent contrast enhancement probe (due to the presence of strongX-ray-attenuating bismuth element) for computed tomography deep tissue tumorimaging and as a therapeutic agent to destruct tumors and prevent metastasis bysynergistic photothermalchemo therapy.DOI: 10.1002/adfm.201704623 PMCID: PMC5918278PMID: 29706855
