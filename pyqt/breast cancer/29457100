This studyretrospectively examined whether differences in heart rate variability may berelated to the appearance of postoperative pain in patients undergoing breastcancer surgery.Findings: We retrospectively analyzed 20 postoperative patients who had no painimmediately upon admission to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), divided into two groups: group A (n = 16) had no pain on admission to PACU, remaining painfree upon discharge (12 h after surgery); group B (n = 4) comprised patients withno pain on admission to PACU but who experienced increasing pain requiringintervention in PACU 1 h after surgery. HRV was measured immediately on admissionto PACU and 2 h after surgery; this included variables of low-frequency power(LF), high-frequency power (HF), and LF/HF. There were significant differences inHF and LF/HF in group A compared with those in group B on admission to PACU(immediately after arrival): HF, group A, 35.4 ± 18.1; group B, 64.2 ± 9.5*;LF/HF group A, 2.7 ± 2.4; group B, 0.6 ± 0.2*, *p < 0.05). There was nosignificant difference in the Numerical rating scale (NRS) between the two groupsimmediately after admission to PACU. At 1 h after the surgery, NRS in Group Bincreased, and there were significant differences in NRS values between the twogroups 1 h after surgery prior to the use of analgesic agents (NRS, group A,1.0 ± 0.9; group B, 4.0 ± 1.4*, *p < 0.01). Patients in group A required noanalgesic agents for at least 12 h after surgery.Conclusions: Lower HF and higher LF/HF values immediately after arrival in PACUwere observed in patients remaining pain free for 12 h after surgery compared to patients who experienced increasing postoperative pain 1 h after surgery. Thedata suggest that differences in HRV may be related to the appearance ofpostoperative pain.DOI: 10.1186/s40981-017-0123-4 PMCID: PMC5804653PMID: 29457100
