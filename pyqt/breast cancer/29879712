Epub 2018 Jun 7.Galangin Induces Apoptosis in MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cells ThroughMitochondrial Pathway and Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/Akt Inhibition.Liu D(1), You P(1), Luo Y(2), Yang M(3), Liu Y(1).Author information: (1)School of Pharmacy, Hubei Key Laboratory of Resource Science and Chemistry in Chinese Medicine, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, China.(2)Affiliated Renhe Hospital of China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China.(3)School of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, China.AIMS: The study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of inhibition ofproliferation and apoptosis induction by galangin against MCF-7 human breastcancer cells.METHODS: Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to assess cell viability and flowcytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis. The expression level ofapoptosis-related proteins (cleaved-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-8,cleaved-caspase-3, Bad, cleaved-Bid, Bcl-2, Bax, p-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3K], and p-Akt) and cell cycle-related proteins (cyclin D3, cyclin B1,cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, p21, p27, p53) were evaluated byWestern blotting.RESULTS: Galangin increased the expression of Bax and decreased the expression ofBcl-2 in a concentration-dependent manner, inhibited cell viability, and induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, the expression of cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-8,caspase-3, Bid, and Bad increased significantly while the expression of p-PI3Kand p-Akt proteins decreased. In addition, the protein levels of cyclin D3,cyclin B1, CDK1, CDK2, and CDK4 were downregulated while the expression levels ofp21, p27, and p53 were upregulated significantly.CONCLUSION: Galangin could suppress the viability of MCF-7 cells and induce cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway and PI3K/Akt inhibition as well as cellcycle arrest.Â© 2018 S.
