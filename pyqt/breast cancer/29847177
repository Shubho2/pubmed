However, the therapeuticefficacy of nanoscale anticancer drug delivery systems is severely truncated bytheir low tumor-targetability and inefficient drug release at the target site.Here, the design and development of novel l-peptide functionalizeddual-responsive nanoparticles (l-CS-g-PNIPAM-PTX) for active targeting andeffective treatment of GRP78-overexpressing human breast cancer in vitro and invivo are reported. l-CS-g-PNIPAM-PTX NPs have a relative high drug loading(13.5%) and excellent encapsulation efficiency (74.3%) and an average diameter of275 nm. The release of PTX is slow at pH 7.4 and 25 °C but greatly accelerated atpH 5.0 and 37 °C. MTT assays and confocal experiments showed that thel-CS-g-PNIPAM-PTX NPs possessed high targetability and antitumor activity toward GRP78 overexpressing MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. As expected,l-CS-g-PNIPAM-PTX NPs could effectively treat mice bearing MDA-MB-231 humanbreast tumor xenografts with little side effects, resulting in completeinhibition of tumor growth and a high survival rate over an experimental periodof 60 days. These results indicate that l-peptide-functionalized acid - andthermally activated - PTX prodrug NPs have a great potential for targetedchemotherapy in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/10717544.2018.1477863 PMID: 29847177
