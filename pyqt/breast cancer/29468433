Male CDH1germline mutation carriers have by the age of 80Â years an estimated 70%cumulative incidence of gastric cancer, females of 56% for gastric and of 42% forlobular breast cancer. Metastatic HDGC has a poor prognosis which is worse thanfor sporadic gastric cancer. To date, there have been no treatment optionsdescribed tailored to this molecular subtype of gastric cancer. Here we reviewrecent differential drug screening and gene expression results in c.1380delCDH1-mutant HDGC cells which identified drug classes targeting PI3K(phosphoinositide 3-kinase), MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), FAK (focaladhesion kinase), PKC (protein kinase C), and TOPO2 (topoisomerase II) asselectively more effective in cells with defective CDH1 function. ERK1-ERK2(extracellular signal regulated kinase) signaling measured as top enrichednetwork in c.1380delA CDH1-mutant cells. We compared these findings to synthetic lethality and pharmacological screening results in isogenic CDH1-/- MCF10Amammary epithelial cells with and without CDH1 expression and current knowledgeof E-cadherin/catenin-EGFR cross-talk, and suggest different rationales how loss of E-cadherin function activates PI3K, mTOR, EGFR, or FAK signaling. These leads represent molecularly selected treatment options tailored to the treatment ofCDH1-deficient familial gastric cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s40169-018-0184-7 PMCID: PMC5821620PMID: 29468433
