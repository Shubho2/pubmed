This study aimed to develop Tmx-loaded span-based nano-vesicles for delivery to malignant tissues withmaximum efficacy. The effect of three variables on vesicle size (Y1), zetapotential (Y2), entrapment efficiency (Y3) and the cumulative percent releaseafter 24 h (Y4) were optimized using Box-Behnken design. The optimized formulawas prepared and tested for its stability in different storage conditions. Theobserved values for the optimized formula were 310.2 nm, - 42.09 mV, 75.45 and71.70% for Y1, Y2, Y3, and Y4, respectively. The examination using electronmicroscopy confirmed the formation of rounded vesicles with distinctive bilayerstructure. Moreover, the cytotoxic activity of the optimized formula on bothbreast cancer cells (MCF-7) and normal cells (BHK) showed enhanced selectivity(9.4 folds) on cancerous cells with IC50 values 4.7 ± 1.5 and 44.3 ± 1.3 μg/ml oncancer and normal cells, respectively. While, free Tmx exhibited lowerselectivity (2.5 folds) than optimized nano-vesicles on cancer cells with IC50values of 9.0 ± 1.1 μg/ml and 22.5 ± 5.3 μg/ml on MCF-7 and BHK cells,respectively. The promising prepared vesicular system, with greater efficacy and selectivity, provides a marvelous tool to overcome breast cancer treatmentchallenges.DOI: 10.1208/s12249-018-0962-y PMID: 29470829
