Clinical trials have established that the combinationof a CDK 4/6 inhibitor with letrozole can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) versus letrozole monotherapy and is safe and well tolerated.Cost-effectiveness studies are required to inform payers and clinical decisionmakers on the money value of combination treatment in clinical practice.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ribociclib plus letrozole versuspalbociclib plus letrozole and versus letrozole monotherapy in the first-linetreatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breastcancer from a U.S. private third-party payer perspective.METHODS: A partitioned survival model including 3 health states (progressionfree, with either overall response or stable disease; progressed disease; anddeath) simulated lifetime costs and outcomes over a 40-year lifetime horizon witha 1-month cycle length. Clinical efficacy data (PFS and overall survival [OS])were derived from a phase III trial of ribociclib plus letrozole (MONALEESA-2;NCT01958021), a phase II trial of palbociclib plus letrozole (PALOMA-1;NCT00721409), and a Bayesian network meta-analysis. Health care costs includeddrug acquisition and monitoring, disease management, subsequent therapies, andserious drug-related adverse events. Effectiveness was measured in life-years,derived from survival projections, and in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs),calculated from time spent in each state combined with health-state utilityvalues. A one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis explored the impact ofuncertainty in key model parameters on results, and probabilistic uncertainty wasassessed through a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis.RESULTS: Ribociclib plus letrozole was dominant versus palbociclib plusletrozole, with a cost saving of $43,037 and a gain of 0.086 QALYs. Compared withletrozole monotherapy, ribociclib plus letrozole was associated with anincremental cost of $144,915 and an incremental QALY of 0.689, equating to anincremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $210,369 per QALY. Key model driversincluded OS HRs for palbociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole and forribociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole, the PFS HR for palbociclib plusletrozole versus letrozole, PD health-state costs, utility of response, and cost discount rate. The probabilities that ribociclib plus letrozole wascost-effective versus letrozole at thresholds of $50,000, $100,000 and $200,000per QALY gained were 1.6%, 6.3%, and 50.5%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, ribociclib plus letrozole is a cost-effective alternative to palbociclib plus letrozole for the first-line treatment ofpostmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Ribociclib plus letrozole is also cost-effective versus letrozole monotherapy at willingness-to-pay thresholds greater than $198,000 per QALY (for probabilisticanalysis).DISCLOSURES: Funding for this study was provided by Novartis, which manufactures ribociclib and provided input on the study design and data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
