In this study, we propose and apply a novelmethod, ISOform-Patterns (ISOP), based on mixture modeling, to characterize theexpression patterns of isoform pairs from the same gene in single-cellisoform-level expression data.Results: We define six principal patterns of isoform expression relationships anddescribe a method for differential-pattern analysis. We demonstrate ISOP through analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from a breast cancer cell line, with replication in three independent datasets. We assigned the pattern types to each of 16Â 562 isoform-pairs from 4929 genes. Among those, 26% of the discoveredpatterns were significant (P<0.05), while remaining patterns are possibly effectsof transcriptional bursting, drop-out and stochastic biological heterogeneity.Furthermore, 32% of genes discovered through differential-pattern analysis werenot detected by differential-expression analysis. Finally, the effects ofdrop-out events and expression levels of isoforms on ISOP's performances wereinvestigated through simulated datasets. To conclude, ISOP provides a novelapproach for characterization of isoform-level preference, commitment andheterogeneity in single-cell RNA-sequencing data.Availability and implementation: The ISOP method has been implemented as a Rpackage and is available at https://github.com/nghiavtr/ISOP under a GPL-3license.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformaticsonline.DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty100 PMCID: PMC6041805PMID: 29490015
