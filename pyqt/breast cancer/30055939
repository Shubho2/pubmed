Electronic address: Annelie.liljegren@sll.se.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with breast cancer receiving mastectomy in ourinstitution are offered immediate breast reconstruction (IBR). IBR may have animpact on the optimisation of radiation therapy (RT). Therefore, we aimed toevaluate the clinical target volume (CTV) dose coverage when disregarding thedose received by the breast implant in women treated for breast cancer.Furthermore, to investigate the safety of immediate breast reconstruction (IBR)with an implant (IBR+) in terms of recurrence and survival compared to patientswithout an implant (IBR-).PATIENTS AND METHODS: This matched-cohort included 128 patients with IBR+ and 252IBR- patients (controls). The potential confounding effects of tumour stage andtreatment were controlled for. For IBR+ patients, the implant volume was excludedfrom the CTV in the RT planning images, and the RT target coverage (V95%: CTVcovered by ≥the 95% isodose) was compared between the IBR+ and IBR- groups.RESULTS: A limited under dosage was observed in patients without lymph-nodeirradiation; the V95% mean values for the CTV subtracting the implant were 84%and 92%, for IBR+ and IBR- groups, respectively. Median follow-up duration was5.8 years (0.1-7.5 years). In comparing IBR+ and IBR- groups, no statisticallysignificant differences were found in the incidence of recurrence rate ratios or recurrence free survival (log-rank p = 0.142), overall survival (log-rankp = 0.096), or breast cancer specific survival (log-rank p = 0.147).CONCLUSIONS: Post-mastectomy radiation therapy and implant-based reconstructionlead to minor under dosage of the target, due to the projection of thesubcutaneous tissue in the presence of the implant. However, recurrence andsurvival rates were equally distributed among IBR+ and IBR- patients indicatingthat the overall treatment protocol used in our institution is safe.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
