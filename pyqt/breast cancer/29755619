CSCs initiate tumorigenesis, and areinvolved in tumor recurrence and metastasis. Furthermore, data show that CSCs arehighly resistant to anticancer drugs. Cetuximab, a specific anti-epidermal growthfactor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody, is used in cancer treatment. Althoughdevelopment of resistance to cetuximab is well recognized, the underlyingmechanisms remain unclear. Lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of epidermal growth factorreceptor (EGFR)/ErbB2, has antiproliferative effects and is used to treatpatients with ErbB2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In this review, cetuximab and lapatinib-resistant oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells proliferationand migration signal transduction passway is discussed by introducing ourresearch.DOI: 10.1016/j.jdsr.2017.11.001 PMCID: PMC5944082PMID: 29755619
