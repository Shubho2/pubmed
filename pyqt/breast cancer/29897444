Thisis particularly problematic, given the importance of medical practitioners'discussing the topic with cancer patients, along with the centrality ofspirituality to many AI patients. The purpose of this article was to explore AIwomen cancer survivors' spiritual coping with their experiences. Using acommunity-based participatory research approach, this qualitative descriptivestudy included a sample of 43 AI women cancer survivors (n = 14 breast cancer, n = 14 cervical cancer, and n = 15 colon and other types of cancer). Qualitativecontent analysis revealed that most participants (76 percent, n = 32) citedprayer as an important part of their cancer recovery and coping strategies. Many participants expressed how prayer and spirituality connected them to family, tofaith communities, and to others. In addition to prayer, over a third (36percent, n = 15) of participants emphasized faith as a recovery and copingstrategy. Results indicate that most women drew great comfort, strength, hope,and relief from their spiritual and faith traditions, indicating that religiousand spiritual practices may be an important protective factor against the strain of the cancer experience.DOI: 10.1093/hsw/hly015 PMID: 29897444
