Electronic address: mmorgan@rcsi.ie.The implementation of mammographic screening programmes in many countries hasbeen linked to a marked increase in early detection and improved prognosis forbreast cancer patients. Breast tumours can be detected by assessing severalfeatures in mammographic images but one of the most common are the presence ofsmall deposits of calcium known as microcalcifications, which in many cases maybe the only detectable sign of a breast tumour. In addition to their efficacy in the detection of breast cancer, the presence of microcalcifications within abreast tumour may also convey useful prognostic information. Breast tumours with associated calcifications display an increased rate of HER2 overexpression aswell as decreased survival, increased risk of recurrence, high tumour grade andincreased likelihood of spread to the lymph nodes. Clearly, the presence ofmicrocalcifications in a tumour is a clinically significant finding, suggestingthat a detailed understanding of their formation may improve our knowledge of theearly stages of breast tumourigenesis, yet there are no reports which attempt to bring together recent basic science research findings and current knowledge ofthe clinical significance of microcalcifications. This review will summarise the most current understanding of the formation of calcifications within breasttissue and explore their associated clinical features and prognostic value.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
