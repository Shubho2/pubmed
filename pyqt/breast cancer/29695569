A polyurethane-based tissue adhesive(TissuGlu®) might facilitate drainage-free wound healing after mastectomy in anon-invasive manner.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospectively, data from 84 patients (42 receivingTissuGlu®, 42 receiving a drainage) who underwent mastectomy, were collected (90 days postoperative follow-up). Study endpoints were defined as the number offluid-related postoperative clinical interventions, cumulative volume ofpostoperative wound fluid, duration of hospitalization and postoperativecomplications.RESULTS: In the entirety of postoperative interventions, no significantdifference could be demonstrated (p=0.298). The drainage arm showed significantlyless seroma aspirations (p=0.024) and complications (p=0.012). A significantlyreduced length of hospitalization (p<0.001) and less cumulative wound secretionvolume (p<0.001) appeared in the TissuGlu® group.CONCLUSION: The polyurethane-based tissue adhesive is a less invasive alternativeto drain use in mastectomy.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11284 PMCID: PMC6000807PMID: 29695569
