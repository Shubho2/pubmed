But the incidence isrising and in some patient groups reaching 15% over the course of their lives.The major risk factors for the development of male breast cancer includeadvancing age, hormonal imbalance, radiation exposure, and a family history ofbreast cancer. Regarding the latter, incidence can be linked to mutations inhigh- or low-penetrance genes. The most relevant risk factor for the development of male breast cancer is a mutation in the BRCA2 gene. Most cases present latebecause of a lack of awareness of the existence of such a malignancy in males andignorance of the related risk factors.
