To our knowledge, no studies have examinedwhether consumption of cruciferous vegetables has changed accordingly, and whatimpact, if any, on breast cancer risk may have resulted. Objective: The timetrend in cruciferous vegetable intake was investigated between 1982 and 1998, andits associations with breast cancer risk were examined. Methods: In ahospital-based case-control study in 1491 patients with breast cancer and 1482controls, loess curves were constructed to describe the relation between medianconsumption of cruciferous vegetables and year of admission. ORs and 95% CIs werecalculated with unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, year ofadmission, family income, body mass index, cigarette smoking, age at menarche,parity, age at first birth, family history of breast cancer, hormone replacement therapy, and total meat intake. Results: Consumption patterns differed betweencases and controls. A slow but steady increase in cruciferous vegetable intakewas observed in the cases, although among controls, cruciferous vegetableconsumption increased from 1982 to 1987, reached a plateau during 1988-1992, and then declined from 1993 to 1998. Accordingly, although an overall inverseassociation with breast cancer risk was observed for cruciferous vegetable intake(highest compared with lowest quartile-OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.86; P-trend =0.0006), the inverse association tended to be more pronounced within morerecent-year strata, with an OR of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.83) for 1993-1998compared with an OR of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.23) for 1982-1987. Conclusions: The consumption of cruciferous vegetables increased during the past 2 decades,showing different trends in cases and controls. The subtle but sustained increasein cruciferous vegetable intake reported by the cases could influence associationstudies with breast cancer risk.DOI: 10.3945/cdn.117.000448 PMCID: PMC5998357PMID: 29955715
