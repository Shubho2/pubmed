The present study was designed to evaluate a chip-baseddigital PCR (dPCR) system for assessing HER2 amplification from formalin-fixedparaffin-embedded breast carcinoma tissue and to compare this system withimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).Materials and methods: A total of 84 breast carcinoma tissue samples wereanalyzed by IHC, FISH, and chip-based dPCR in a blinded manner.Results: All nine IHC-positive and 35 IHC-negative samples had equivalent resultswith dPCR, taking an amplification ratio threshold of 1.8 as a positive result.Of the 40 IHC equivocal samples, 10 were assessed as positive, 27 as negative,and three as equivocal by dPCR.Conclusion: These results demonstrate that chip-based dPCR is suitable for HER2amplification detection in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples in a clinicalsetting, providing the advantages of superior turnaround time,cost-effectiveness, and increased precision with absolute quantification comparedwith conventional tests such as FISH and IHC. This methodology was especiallybeneficial in tissue samples with low DNA concentration.DOI: 10.2147/BCTT.S161264 PMCID: PMC6061198PMID: 30087576
