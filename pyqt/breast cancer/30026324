[Epub ahead of print]Targeting CCR8 induces protective antitumor immunity and enhances vaccine-inducedresponses in colon cancer.Villarreal DO(1), L'Huillier A(2), Armington S(2), Mottershead C(2), FilippovaEV(2), Coder BD(2), Petit RG(2), Princiotta MF(2).Author information: (1)ImmunoOncology - Research, Advaxis (United States) dovill33@gmail.com.(2)ImmunoOncology - Research, Advaxis (United States).CCR8 is a chemokine receptor expressed principally on regulatory T cells (Tregs) and is known to be critical for CCR8+ Treg-mediated immunosuppression. Recentstudies have demonstrated that CCR8 is uniquely upregulated in humantumor-resident Tregs of breast, colon, and lung cancer patients when compared to normal tissue-resident Tregs. Therefore, CCR8+ tumor-resident Tregs are rational targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we demonstrate that monoclonal antibody(mAb) therapy targeting CCR8 significantly suppresses tumor growth and improveslong-term survival in colorectal tumor mouse models. This antitumor activitycorrelated with increased tumor-specific T cells, enhanced infiltration of CD4+and CD8+ T cells, and a significant decrease in the frequency of tumor-residentCD4+CCR8+ Tregs. Tumor-specific CD8+ T cells displayed lower expression ofexhaustion markers as well as increased functionality upon restimulation.Treatment with anti-CCR8 mAb prevented de novo induction and suppressive functionof Tregs without affecting CD8+ T cells. Initial studies explored a combinatorialregimen using anti-CCR8 mAb therapy and a Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-basedimmunotherapy. Anti-CCR8 mAb therapy synergized with Lm-based immunotherapy tosignificantly delay growth of established tumors and prolong survival.Collectively, these findings identify CCR8 as a promising new target for tumorimmunotherapy and provide a strong rationale for further development of thisapproach, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other immunotherapies.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-1119 PMID: 30026324
