We divided the patients into two groups, according to theclassification of the Brazilian National Elderly Policy and the Statute of theElderly: young (age <60 years) and elderly (60 years or more). We also groupedthem according to the World Health Organization classification: young people (age<44 years), middle age (45-59 years); elderly (age 60-89 years) and extremeadvanced age (90 years or older). We applied the surgical risk classification of the American Society of Anesthesiologists to investigate the role of thepreoperative physical state as a possible predictor of complications.RESULTS: of the 560 patients operated on, 94 (16.8%) were 60 years of age orolder. We observed a local complication rate of 49.8%, the majority beingself-limited. The incidences of necrosis, infection and dehiscence were 15.5%,10.9% and 9.3%, respectively. Patients older than 60 years presented a chance of complication 1.606 times greater than the younger ones. Forty-five (8%) patients had loss of the reconstruction; there was no statistically significant differencein the mean age of the patients who presented this result or not (p=0.321).CONCLUSION: in selected patients, breast reconstruction can be considered safe;most documented complications were limited and could be treated conservatively.DOI: 10.1590/0100-6991e-20181616 PMID: 29617492
