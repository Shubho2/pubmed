[Epub ahead of print]MicroRNA-498 promotes proliferation and migration by targeting the tumorsuppressor PTEN in breast cancer cells.Chai C(1), Wu H(1), Wang B(1), Eisenstat DD(2), Leng RP(1).Author information: (1)Heritage Medical Research Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine andPathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.(2)Department of Oncology, Cross Cancer Institute, University of Alberta,Edmonton, Alberta Canada.Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with a poorprognosis and high mortality rate. The tumor suppressor PTEN plays an importantrole in cell proliferation and cell migration by negatively regulating thePI3K/Akt pathway. PTEN is down-regulated by microRNAs in multiple cancers.However, few microRNAs have been reported to directly target PTEN in TNBC. Inthis study, microRNAs predicted to target PTEN were screened by usingimmunoblotting and luciferase reporter assays. Expression levels of microRNA-498 (miR-498) were measured by TaqMan microRNA assays. We performed clonogenic, cell cycle and scratch wound assays to examine the oncogenic role of miR-498. Wedemonstrated that miR-498 directly targeted the 3'UTR of PTEN mRNA and reducedPTEN protein levels in TNBC cells. Compared to the non-tumorigenic breastepithelial cell line MCF-10A, TNBC cell lines overexpressed miR-498. Moreover,miR-498 promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in TNBC cells in aPTEN-dependent manner. Suppressing miR-498 overexpression impaired the oncogenic effects of miR-498 on cell proliferation and cell migration. This studyidentified a novel microRNA (miR-498) overexpressed in TNBC cells and itsoncogenic role in suppressing PTEN. These results provide new insight into thedown-regulation of PTEN and indicate a potential therapeutic target for treating TNBC.DOI: 10.1093/carcin/bgy092 PMID: 29985991
