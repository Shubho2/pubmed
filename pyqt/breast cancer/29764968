The riskof RICHD increases with radiation dose. Exposed patients may present decadesafter treatment with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic myocardialperfusion defects to ostial, triple-vessel disease and sudden cardiac death.RICHD is insidious, with a long latency and a tendency to remain silent late intothe disease course. Vessel involvement is often diffuse and is preferentiallyproximal. The pathophysiology is similar to that of accelerated atherosclerosis, characterised by the formation of inflammatory plaque with high collagen andfibrin content. The presence of conventional risk factors potentiates RICHD, and aggressive risk factor management should ideally be initiated prior to radiation therapy. Stress echocardiography is more sensitive and specific than myocardialperfusion imaging in the detection of RICHD, and CT coronary angiography showspromise in risk stratification. Coronary artery bypass grafting is associatedwith higher risks of graft failure, perioperative complications and all-causemortality in patients with RICHD. In most cases, the use of drug-eluting stentsis preferable to surgical intervention, bare metal stenting orballoon-angioplasty alone.Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
