A3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and a plate clone formation assay were used to examine inhibition of theproliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells by FL118. Cell cycle distribution was detected using flow cytometry. A wound healing assay and a transwell assay were performed to detect the effects of FL118 on migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells,respectively. qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry were used tostudy the effects of FL118 on expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT)-related molecules and Wnt/ β-catenin signaling components in MDA-MB-231cells. The current results indicated that FL118 inhibited the proliferation,migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. FL118 caused MDA-MB-231 cells to accumulate in the S phase. FL118 significantlysuppressed the expression of vimentin while enhancing the expression ofE-cadherin. Moreover, decreased expression of β-catenin and its targets survivin and cyclin Dl was detected in the nucleus of MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together,the current results suggest that FL118 inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling, leadingto suppressed EMT and decreased migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.5582/bst.2017.01288 PMID: 29553100
