The 2 micro-invasive areas found were too small for reliableimmunostainings for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors. In the sentinellymph-node, a subcapsular tumor embole of about 50 cancer cells was identified onthe extemporaneous cryo-cut section, but not on further sections afterparaffin-embedding of the sample. Considering this tumor metastatic potential, wedecided to assess HER2 status on the metastatic embole using pathological andmolecular micro-methods. We laser-microdissected the tumor cells, extracted theirDNA, and performed droplet-digital-PCR (ddPCR) for HER2 gene copy numbervariation. The HER2/RNaseP allele ratio was 5.2 in the laser-microdissected tumorcells, similar to the 5.3 ratio in the HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cellline BT-474. We thus optimized the adjuvant treatment of our patient and shereceived a trastuzumab-based adjuvant chemotherapy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25161 PMCID: PMC5978270PMID: 29854320
