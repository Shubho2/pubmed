DC (MP) is an ancient Indianmedicinal plant traditionally used to treat Parkinson's disease. L-Dopa (LD),precursor of dopamine is abundantly found in the seeds of MP. L-dopa is a naturalinhibitor of prolactin (PRL) hormone which is required to maintain lactation inwomen but it's over production (hyperprolactinemia) plays critical role inadvancement of breast cancer.AIM OF THE STUDY: We aim to examine the pharmacological effect of LD and MP onthis hyperprolactinemia associated breast cancer and related signaling foreffective management of the disease. We also investigated chemo-sensitizingeffect of MP on hyperprolactinemia-mediated cisplatin resistance.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic seed extract of MP were prepared and analysedusing HPLC. Effect of LD and MP on the cellular viability of breast cancer cells (T47D, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) were evaluated using MTT assay. Further,effect of LD and MP on colony forming potential, DNA damage, cell cycledistribution and apoptosis was determined using agar/agarose method, comet assay and annexin and PI method followed by FACS analysis. To reveal the molecularmechanism involved in the anti-cancer activity of MP, transcriptional andtranslational level analysis of the key proteins involved in the PRL-mediatedsignaling, was performed using RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The effect of MPextract on PRL-mediated signaling was validated using dopaminergic agonistbromocriptine. MP extract and cisplatin was given in different combination withappropriate controls to check their effect on chemo-resistivity of breast cancer cells.RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that MP seed extract has the potential toinhibit cellular proliferation of PRL expressing T47D and MCF-7 breast cancercells via induction of DNA damage, G1 phase of cell cycle arrest and apoptosismore effectively as compare to LD. Further, MP-mediated anti-cancerous effect wasassociated with the downregulation of PRL expression, further suppressing theJAK2/STAT5A/Cyclin D1 signaling pathway which has been validated usingdopaminergic agonist bromocriptine. Cancer-related hyperprolactinemia conferscisplatin resistance, we observed that MP via PRL inhibition, enhances cisplatin efficacy after their combinatorial treatment in breast cancer cells.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our study suggests that MP could be recommended asdietary supplement along with the chemotherapeutic agents against breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
