Aberrant silencing or activationof such alternative promoters is associated with multiple diseases includingcancer, but little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that controlalternative promoter choice. The SHC1 gene encodes p46Shc/p52Shc and p66Shc,proteins oppositely regulating anchorage independent growth that are producedrespectively by transcription initiated from the upstream and downstream tandempromoters of SHC1 Here we demonstrate that activation of these promoters ismutually exclusive on separate alleles in single primary endothelial cells in aheritable fashion, assuring expression of both transcripts by the cell.Peripheral blood lymphocytes that do not transcribe p66Shc transcribed p52Shcbiallelically. This distinct monoallelic transcription pattern is established by allele-specific chromosomal looping between tandem promoters, which silences the upstream promoter. Our results reveal a new mechanism to control alternativepromoter usage through higher order chromatin structure.Copyright Â© 2018 American Society for Microbiology.DOI: 10.1128/MCB.00658-17 PMCID: PMC5902595 [Available on 2018-10-16]PMID: 29440311
