With relatively little is known about thegenetic abnormalities present in these secondary tumors, we examined genomicvariation in biospecimens from radiation-associated breast angiosarcomas.Experimental Design: Patients were identified that had a previous breast cancerdiagnosis, received radiation therapy, and developed angiosarcoma in theipsilateral breast as the earlier cancer. Tumor regions were isolated fromarchival blocks using subsequent laser capture microdissection. Next generationsequencing was performed using a targeted panel of 160 cancer-related genes.Genomic variants were identified for mutation and trinucleotide-based mutational signature analysis.Results: 44 variants in 34 genes were found in more than two thirds of the cases;this included 12 variants identified as potentially deleterious. Of particularnote, the BRCA1 DNA damage response pathway was highly enriched with geneticvariation. In a comparison to local recurrences, 14 variants in 11 genes werepresent in both the primary and recurrent lesions including variants in genesassociated with the DNA damage response machinery. Furthermore, the mutationalsignature analysis shows that a previously defined IR signature is present inalmost all of the current samples characterized by predominantly Câ†’Tsubstitutions.Conclusions: While radiation-associated breast angiosarcomas are relativelyuncommon, their prognosis is very poor. These data demonstrate a mutationalpattern associated with genes involved in DNA repair. While important inrevealing the biology behind these tumors, it may also suggest new treatmentstrategies that will prove successful.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24273 PMCID: PMC5839370PMID: 29515789
