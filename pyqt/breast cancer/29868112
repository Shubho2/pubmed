Here, we used whole-exome sequencing(WES) to identify genetic variants associated to HBC in 17 patients of Brazilwith familial BC and negative for causal variants in major BC risk genes(BRCA1/2, TP53, and CHEK2 c.1100delC). First, we searched for rare variants in 27known HBC genes and identified two patients harboring truncating pathogenicvariants in ATM and BARD1. For the remaining 15 negative patients, we found asubstantial vast number of rare genetic variants. Thus, for selecting the mostpromising variants we used functional-based variant prioritization, followed byNGS validation, analysis in a control group, cosegregation analysis in one familyand comparison with previous WES studies, shrinking our list to 23 novel BCcandidate genes, which were evaluated in an independent cohort of 42 high-risk BCpatients. Rare and possibly damaging variants were identified in 12 candidategenes in this cohort, including variants in DNA repair genes (ERCC1 and SXL4) andother cancer-related genes (NOTCH2, ERBB2, MST1R, and RAF1). Overall, this is thefirst WES study applied for identifying novel genes associated to HBC inBrazilian patients, in which we provide a set of putative BC predisposing genes. We also underpin the value of using WES for assessing the complex landscape ofHBC susceptibility, especially in less characterized populations.DOI: 10.3389/fgene.2018.00161 PMCID: PMC5949367PMID: 29868112
