We pooled risk factor and pathology data on 5,905 HR+ breastcancer cases and 26,281 controls from 11 epidemiological studies. Proliferationwas determined by centralized automated measures of KI67 in tissue microarrays.Odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values for case-case andcase-control comparisons for risk factors in relation to levels of grade andquartiles (Q1-Q4) of KI67 were estimated using polytomous logistic regressionmodels. Case-case comparisons showed associations between nulliparity and highKI67 [OR (95% CI) for Q4 vs. Q1 = 1.54 (1.22, 1.95)]; obesity and high grade[grade 3 vs. 1 = 1.68 (1.31, 2.16)] and current use of combined hormone therapy(HT) and low grade [grade 3 vs. 1 = 0.27 (0.16, 0.44)] tumors. In case-controlcomparisons, nulliparity was associated with elevated risk of tumors with highbut not low levels of proliferation [1.43 (1.14, 1.81) for KI67 Q4 vs. 0.83(0.60, 1.14) for KI67 Q1]; obesity among women ≥50 years with high but not lowgrade tumors [1.55 (1.17, 2.06) for grade 3 vs. 0.88 (0.66, 1.16) for grade 1]and HT with low but not high grade tumors [3.07 (2.22, 4.23) for grade 1 vs. 0.85(0.55, 1.30) for grade 3]. Menarcheal age and family history were similarlyassociated with HR+ tumors of different grade or KI67 levels. These findingsprovide insights into the etiologic heterogeneity of HR+ tumors.© 2018 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley & SonsLtd on behalf of UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31352 PMCID: PMC6041155 [Available on 2019-08-15]PMID: 29492969
