However, developing nanoparticles could help to improve theefficacy/toxicity balance of this doublet by improving drug trafficking anddelivery to tumors. This project aimed to develop an immunoliposome in breastcancer, combining docetaxel encapsulated in a stealth liposome engrafted withtrastuzumab, and comparing its performances on human breast cancer cell lineswith standard combination of docetaxel plus trastuzumab.Methods: Several strategies to engraft trastuzumab to pegylated liposomes weretested. Immunoliposomes made of natural (antibody nanoconjugate-1 [ANC-1]) andsynthetic lipids (ANC-2) were synthesized using standard thin film method andcompared in size, morphology, docetaxel encapsulation, trastuzumab engraftmentrates and stability. Antiproliferative activity was tested on human breast cancermodels ranging from almost negative (MDA-MB-231), positive (MDA-MB-453) tooverexpressing (SKBR3) HER2. Finally, cell uptake of ANC-1 was studied byelectronic microscopy.Results: ANC-1 showed a greater docetaxel encapsulation rate (73%±6% vs 53%±4%)and longer stability (up to 1 week) as compared with ANC-2. Both ANC presentedparticle size ≤150 nm and showed similar or higher in vitro antiproliferativeactivities than standard treatment, ANC-1 performing better than ANC-2. The IC50sfor docetaxel combined to free trastuzumab were 8.7±4, 2±0.7 and 6±2 nM withMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453 and SKBR3, respectively. The IC50s for ANC-1 were 2.5±1,1.8±0.6 and 3.4±0.8 nM and for ANC-2 were 1.8±0.3 nM, 2.8±0.8 nM and 6.8±1.8 nMwith MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453 and SKBR3, respectively. Cellular uptake appeared to depend on HER2 expression, the higher the expression, the higher the uptake.Conclusion: In vitro results suggest that higher antiproliferative efficacy andefficient drug delivery can be achieved in breast cancer models usingnanoparticles.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S162454 PMCID: PMC6014390PMID: 29950829  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
