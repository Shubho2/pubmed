Previous studies have shown that the IL-17A-mediatedinvasion of breast cancer cells can be inhibited by selective antagonists of the matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), suggesting that the cross-talk between IL-17Aand MMP-9 may promote cancer invasiveness and metastasis. Here, we present anovel strategy for developing cancer therapeutics, based on the simultaneousbinding and inhibition of both IL-17A and MMP-9. To this end, we use abi-specific heterodimeric fusion protein, comprising a natural inhibitor of MMPs (N-TIMP2) fused with an engineered extracellular domain (V3) of the IL-17Areceptor. We show that, as compared with the mono-specific inhibitors of IL-17A(V3) and MMP-9 (N-TIMP2), the engineered bi-specific fusion protein inhibits bothMMP-9 activation and IL-17A-induced cytokine secretion from fibroblasts andexhibits a synergistic inhibition of both the migration and invasion of breastcancer cells. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that dual targetingof inflammatory (IL-17A) and extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP) pathways canpotentially be used as a novel therapeutic approach against cancer. Moreover, theplatform developed here for generating the bi-specific IL-17A/MMP-9 inhibitor canbe utilized for generating bi-specific inhibitors for other cytokines and MMPs.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25526 PMCID: PMC6033355PMID: 29983876
