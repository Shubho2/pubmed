[Epub ahead ofprint]Neuropilin-1 upregulation elicits adaptive resistance to oncogene-targetedtherapies.Rizzolio S, Cagnoni G, Battistini C, Bonelli S, Isella C, Van Ginderachter JA,Bernards R, Di Nicolantonio F, Giordano S, Tamagnone L.Cancer cell dependence on activated oncogenes is targeted therapeutically, butacquired resistance is virtually unavoidable. Here we show that the treatment of addicted melanoma cells with BRAF-inhibitors, and of breast cancer cells withHER2-targeted drugs, led to an adaptive rise in Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) expression,which is crucial for the onset of acquired resistance to therapy. Moreover, NRP1 levels dictated the efficacy of MET oncogene-inhibitors in addicted stomach andlung carcinoma cells. Mechanistically, NRP1 induced a JNK-dependent signalingcascade leading to the upregulation of alternative effector kinases, EGFR orIGF1R, which in turn sustained cancer cell growth and mediated acquiredresistance to BRAF, HER2, or MET inhibitors. Notably, the combination withNRP1-interfering molecules improved the efficacy of oncogene-targeted drugs, and prevented, or even reversed, the onset of resistance in cancer cells and tumormodels. Our study provides the rationale for targeting the NRP1-dependentupregulation of tyrosine kinases, responsible for loss of responsiveness tooncogene-targeted therapies.DOI: 10.1172/JCI99257 PMID: 29953416
