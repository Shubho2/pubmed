This study aimed toinvestigate competing causes of death and prognostic factors within a largecohort of breast cancer patients and to describe the heart-specific mortality in relation to the general population.Methods and results: In this registry-based cohort study, women diagnosed withbreast cancer between 2000 and 2011, who were treated with radiotherapy orchemotherapy and followed until 2014, were identified from the Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End Results-18 (SEER-18) database. Cumulative mortalityfunctions were computed. To investigate heart-specific mortality relative to the general population, long-term (≥10 years) standardized mortality ratios (SMRs)were calculated. Prognostic factors for heart-specific mortality were assessed bycalculating cause-specific hazard ratios (HRcs) with corresponding 95% confidenceintervals using the Cox proportional hazards regression. Subgroup analysis onintermediate-term mortality according to molecular subtypes, for whichinformation was available since 2010, was performed. In total, 347 476 breastcancer patients were eligible to be included in the study. Among all possiblecompeting causes of death, breast cancer accounted for the highest cumulativemortality. Compared with the general population, heart-specific mortality ofbreast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy was lower[SMRoverall 0.84 (0.79-0.90)]. In subgroup analysis, human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive subtype was not associated with increasedheart-specific mortality relative to HER2-negative patients [HRcs 0.96(0.70-1.32)].Conclusion: Heart-specific mortality among breast cancer survivors is notincreased compared with the general population. Human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2-positive patients do not have increased heart-specific mortalitycompared to HER2-negative patients.DOI: 10.1093/eurheartj/ehy167 PMID: 29635274
