Boughey.Judy@mayo.edu.BACKGROUND: While breast cancer has historically been treated with surgeryfollowed by adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) and radiation when indicated, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) use is thought to be increasing; however, the trends of itsuse in various biological subtypes have not been evaluated. We sought to evaluatethe trend of NAC use over time by biological subtype.METHODS: We identified all patients with invasive breast cancer who underwentcurative intent surgery and were treated with chemotherapy from 2010 to 2015 fromthe National Cancer Database. An unadjusted analysis of trends in proportionsover time was performed using Cochran-Armitage trend tests stratified by hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.RESULTS: Of 315,264 patients who received chemotherapy, 251,726 (79.8%) received AC and 63,538 (20.2%) received NAC. From 2010 to 2015, significant increases inNAC use were seen in all biologic subtypes (all p < 0.001). The highestproportions and greatest increases in proportions of NAC were seen amongtriple-negative breast cancers (TNBC; 19.5-33.7%) and HER2+ (HR-/HER2+,21.5-39.8%; HR+/HER2+, 17.0-33.7%) tumors. HR+/HER2- tumors also had astatistically significant increase in use but this increase was less dramatic(13.0-16.8%) and NAC use in recent years was significantly lower than in othersubtypes (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Within patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer, its receiptin the neoadjuvant setting has been increasing among all biologic subtypes. Thehighest use of NAC is in TNBC and HER2+ disease, with use in these subgroupsbeing twice as frequent as in HR+/HER2- disease.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6531-5 PMID: 29786125
