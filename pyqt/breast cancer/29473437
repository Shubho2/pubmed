Ltd ., Jinan , P.R.China.One new triterpenoid saponin (1), as well as six known ones (2-7), were isolated from the ethanol extract of the thorns of Gleditsia sinensis. Their structureswere elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis in conjunction with chemical evidence. Cytotoxic activity of compounds 1-6 was evaluated against human breast cancer MCF 7 cells in vitro by the MTT method. Our results revealed moderateactivities for compounds 1-6 with IC50 values of 18.43, 30.47, 18.46, 10.02,30.76, and 17.32 μM, respectively. Furthermore, compounds 1, 3, 4, and 6 induced apoptosis in MCF 7 cell, with 1 and 6 causing late apoptosis of MCF 7 cells,while 3 and 4 acting oppositely.DOI: 10.1080/14786419.2018.1443092 PMID: 29473437
