In this review, we discuss therole of dysregulation of spliceosomal component genes and associated factors inthe progression of breast cancer, their role in therapy resistance and the use ofquantitative isoform expression as potential prognostic and predictive biomarkerswith a particular focus on oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.Â© 2018 The authors.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-18-0068 PMCID: PMC6055305PMID: 29848666
