China.Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 15-20% of allbreast cancer cases and is usually more aggressive with a poorer clinical outcomecompared with other breast cancer subtypes. Evidence of the involvement ofmicroRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer has provided an opportunity for the development ofnovel effective therapeutic targets in TNBC. In the present study, the miRNAexpression profiles of the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7cells, was evaluated by using miRNA microarray analysis. A total of 107differentially expressed miRNAs (57 upregulated and 50 downregulated) wereidentified in MDA-MB-231 cells compared with MCF-7 cells. Five prominentlydysregulated miRNAs (miR-200c-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-222-3p, miR-192-5p andmiR-146a) were further confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerasechain reaction. In addition, gene ontology analysis and pathway enrichmentanalysis revealed that the dysregulated miRNAs and predicted targets were foundto be involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase, Wnt, and transforminggrowth factor-Î² signaling pathways, which were known to contribute to TNBCprogression and metastasis. Finally, miRNA gene network analyses suggested thatmiR-200c may serve as a crucial miRNA in breast cancer. Taken together, thesefindings may provide a comprehensive view of the function of aberrant miRNAsinvolved in TNBC, and dysregulated miRNAs hold promise as potential biomarkersand therapeutic targets for patients with TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7707 PMCID: PMC5778821PMID: 29435032
