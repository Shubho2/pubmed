To augment the gene/drug load capacity and circumvent thepotential toxicity brought by traditional inorganic and polymeric nanocarriers, a"stealth" carrier was herein designed in a simple self-assembly of(-)-epigallocatechin-3- O-gallate (EGCG) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) byrecruiting protamine as a biodegradable medium for the treatment ofdrug-resistant triple-negative breast cancer. In the self-assembled nanogel,entrapped siRNA played a central role in sensitizing the tumor response toEGCG-involved chemotherapy, and the positively charged protamine served as theassembly skeleton to fully accommodate gene and drug molecules and minimize thefactors causing side effects. As compared to stand-alone chemotherapy with EGCG, the multicomponent nanogel revealed a 15-fold increase in the cytotoxicity todrug-resistant MDA-MB-231 cell line. Moreover, equipped with hyaluronic acid and tumor-homing cell-penetrating peptide as the outmost targeting ligands, thesiRNA- and EGCG-loaded nanogel demonstrates superior selectivity and tumor growthinhibition to free EGCG in xenograft MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice. Meanwhile,thanks to the acknowledged biosafety of protamine, little toxicity was found tonormal tissues and organs in the animal model. This gene/drug self-assembly cagedin a biodegradable carrier opens up an effective and secure route fordrug-resistant cancer therapy and provides a versatile approach for codelivery ofother genes and drugs for different medical purposes.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b19577 PMID: 29436217
