Electronic address: koegel@em.uni-frankfurt.de.Target-specific treatment modalities are currently not available fortriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and acquired chemotherapy resistance is aprimary obstacle for the treatment of these tumors. Here we employed derivatives of BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines that were adapted to grow in thepresence of either 5-Fluorouracil, Doxorubicin or Docetaxel in an aim to identifymolecular pathways involved in the adaptation to drug-induced cell killing. Allsix drug-adapted BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines displayed cross resistance tochemotherapy and decreased apoptosis sensitivity. Expression of theanti-apoptotic co-chaperone BAG3 was notably enhanced in two thirds (4/6) of the six resistant lines simultaneously with higher expression of HSP70 in comparison to parental controls. Doxorubicin-resistant BT-549 (BT-549rDOX20) and5-Fluorouracil-resistant MDA-MB-468 (MDA-MB-468r5-FU2000) cells were chosen forfurther analysis with the autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 and lentiviraldepletion of ATG5, indicating that enhanced cytoprotective autophagy partiallycontributes to increased drug resistance and cell survival. Stable lentiviralBAG3 depletion was associated with a robust down-regulation of Mcl-1, Bcl-2 andBcl-xL, restoration of drug-induced apoptosis and reduced cell adhesion in these cells, and these death-sensitizing effects could be mimicked with the BAG3/Hsp70 interaction inhibitor YM-1 and by KRIBB11, a selective transcriptional inhibitor of HSF-1. Furthermore, BAG3 depletion was able to revert the EMT-liketranscriptional changes observed in BT-549rDOX20 and MDA-MB-468r5-FU2000 cells.In summary, genetic and pharmacological interference with BAG3 is capable toresensitize TNBC cells to treatment, underscoring its relevance for cell deathresistance and as a target to overcome therapy resistance of breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
