China.Development of an improved breast cancer therapy has been an elusive goal ofcancer gene therapy for a long period of time. Human mesenchymal stem cellsderived from umbilical cord (hUMSCs) genetically modified with the interleukin(IL)-18 gene (hUMSCs/IL-18) were previously demonstrated to be able to suppressthe proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. In thepresent study, the effect of hUMSCs/IL-18 on breast cancer in a mouse model wasinvestigated. A total of 128 mice were divided into 2 studies (the early-effectstudy and the late-effect study), with 4 groups in each, including the PBS-,hUMSC-, hUMSC/vector- and hUMSC/IL-18-treated groups. All treatments wereinjected along with 200 µl PBS. Following therapy, the tumor size, histologicalexamination, and expression of lymphocytes, Ki-67, cluster of differentiation 31 and cytokines [interleukin (IL)-18, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-γ and TNF-α] in each group were analyzed. Proliferation of cells (assessed by measuring tumor size andKi-67 expression) and metastasis, (by determining pulmonary and hepaticmetastasis) of breast cancer cells in the hUMSC/IL-18 group were significantlydecreased compared with all other groups. hUMSCs/IL-18 suppressed tumor cellproliferation by activating immunocytes and immune cytokines, decreasing theproliferation index of proliferation marker protein Ki-67 of tumor cells andinhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, hUMSCs/IL-18 were able to induce amore marked and improved therapeutic effect in the tumor sites, particularly inearly tumors. The results of the present study indicate that hUMSCs/IL-18 wereable to inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells in vivo, possibly leading to an approach for a novel antitumor therapy in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8166 PMCID: PMC5920279PMID: 29725393
