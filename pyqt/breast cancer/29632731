However, thesuppressive function of MDSCs on B cells and its underlying mechanism remainunclear. Here, we show that in 4T1 breast cancer mice, a significantly increased number of MDSCs, in parallel with splenic B cells, are accumulated when compared to normal mice. In the presence of MDSCs, the surface molecules of B cells areremolded, with checkpoint-related molecules such as PD-1 and PD-L1 changingprominently. MDSCs also emerge as vital regulators in B-cell immune functionssuch as proliferation, apoptosis and the abilities to secrete antibodies andcytokines. Our study further identifies that MDSCs can transform normal B cellsto a subtype of immuno- regulatory B cells (Bregs) which inhibit T-cell response.Furthermore, we identified a novel kind of Bregs with a specific phenotypePD-1-PD-L1+CD19+, which exert the greatest suppressive effects on T cells incomparison with the previously reported Bregs characterized as CD1d+CD5+CD19+,CD5+CD19+ and Interleukin (IL)-10-secreting B cells. Our results highlight thatMDSCs regulate B-cell response and may serve as a therapeutic approach inanti-tumor treatment. Investigation of this new Breg subtype extends ourunderstanding of regulation of T-cell response and sheds new light on anti-tumor immunity and immune therapy.DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1413520 PMCID: PMC5889195 [Available on 2019-02-20]PMID: 29632731
