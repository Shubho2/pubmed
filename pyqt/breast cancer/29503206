Electronic address: xianc@email.unc.edu.To discriminate the patient subpopulations with different clinical outcomeswithin each breast cancer (BC) subtype, we introduce a robust,clinical-practical, activity-based proteogenomic method that identifies, in theironcogenically active states, candidate biomarker genes bearing patient-specifictranscriptomic/genomic alterations of prognostic value. First, we used theintronic splicing enhancer (ISE) probes to sort ISE-interacting trans-actingprotein factors (trans-interactome) directly from a tumor tissue for subsequentmass spectrometry characterization. In the retrospective, proteogenomic analysis of patient datasets, we identified those ISE trans-factor-encoding genes showing interaction-correlated expression patterns (iCEPs) as new BC-subtypic genes.Further, patient-specific co-alterations in mRNA expression of select iCEP genes distinguished high-risk patient subsets/subpopulations from other patients withina single BC subtype. Function analysis further validated a tumor-phenotypictrans-interactome contained the drivers of oncogenic splicing switches,representing the predominant tumor cells in a tissue, from which novelpersonalized biomarkers were clinically characterized/validated for preciseprognostic prediction and subsequent individualized alignment of optimal therapy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
