Bone metastases was confirmed in all patients by technetium-99mhydroxymethylene diphosphonate (99mTc-HMDP) bone scintigraphy. The numeric ratingscale (NRS) and performance status (PS) were used to assess the degree of painand patients' physical condition. The extent of bone metastases was assessed withimaging modalities including CT, MRI and/or 99mTc bone scintigraphy beforetreatment and 2 or 3 months after.RESULTS: The pain relief response of 89SrCl2 with ZA for bone metastases was 94% (48/51) from 1 to 3 months after treatment. The tumoricidal effect of concurrent therapy by 89SrCl2 with ZA for painful bone metastases was 8/22 as shown byimaging modalities and the rate of non-progressive disease (non-PD) was 19/22.Pain due to bone metastases assessed with the NRS was significantly improved(P<0.001) in many types of primary cancer, including prostate, breast and lungcancers.CONCLUSION: Concurrent therapy of 89SrCl2 with ZA may offer not only pain relief,but also a tumoricidal effect for painful bone metastases.DOI: 10.1967/s002449910702 PMID: 29550842  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
