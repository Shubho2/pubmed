Herein, the clinicalvalue of miR-331 expression was investigated by analyzing its levels in breastbenign and malignant tumors.METHODS: The expression levels of miR-331 were quantified via real-time PCR in130 malignant and 66 benign breast tissue specimens collected after surgicalresection of primary tumors. The generated data were analyzed by applying severalstatistical tests in order to examine the relationship of miR-331 expression withvarious established clinicopathological features and survival data of patients.RESULTS: Our data showed that miR-331 was overexpressed in malignant breasttumors compared to their benign counterparts both overall (P = 0.026) andindividually when the subgroups of fibroadenoma and invasive ductal carcinomawere analyzed with each other (P = 0.001). ROC curve analysis confirmed thediagnostic value of these variations, providing an AUC value equal to 0.597(P = 0.026) and 0.663 (P = 0.001), respectively. Furthermore, miR-331 levels wereelevated (P = 0.026) in ductal cancerous specimens compared to the lobular onesbut failed to correlate with other clinicopathological features or survival data of the breast cancer patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that miR-331 levels might providevaluable information regarding the differential diagnosis of benign and malignantbreast tumors but present no prognostic value for breast cancer.Copyright © 2018.
