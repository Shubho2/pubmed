Several studies have shown thatcantharidin has a cytotoxic effect on various cancer cells. However, few studies have examined the effect of cantharidin on signal transducer and activator oftranscription 3 (STAT3) signaling in cancer. In this study, we isolatedcantharidin from cantharides by bioassay-guided fractionation and examined itsinhibitory effect on STAT3 activation in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells,expressing high level of phosphorylated STAT3. Cantharides were extracted withacetonitrile and separated into hexane, methylene chloride/acetonitrile, andwater fractions. The methylene chloride/acetonitrile fraction was furtherseparated into four fractions by preparative high-throughput high-performanceliquid chromatography. Cantharidin was then isolated from the third fraction bycountercurrent chromatography and structurally determined by comparing nuclearmagnetic resonance and high-resolution mass spectrometry data. Cantharidininhibited STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cantharidinsuppressed epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signalingpathways through inhibition of EGF receptor phosphorylation. Moreover,cantharidin reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis with downregulation of STAT3 target genes, such as Bcl-2, COX-2, and cyclin D1. Taken together, this study provides evidence that cantharidin may be a potential therapeutic agent fortriple-negative breast cancer by reducing EGFR-mediated STAT3 and Akt signalingpathways.DOI: 10.1007/s11418-018-1226-6 PMID: 30043217
