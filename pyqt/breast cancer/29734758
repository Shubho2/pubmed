We here investigated the prevalence of CD146 expression inbreast cancer subtypes, its relation to prognosis, the relation between CD146 andEMT and the outcome to tamoxifen. Primary breast cancer tissues from 1342patients were available for this retrospective study and immunohistochemicallystained for CD146. For survival analyses, pure prognosis was studied by onlyincluding lymph-node negative patients who did not receive (neo)adjuvant systemictreatment (n = 551). 11% of the tumors showed CD146 expression. CD146 expression was most prevalent in triple-negative cases (64%, p < 0.001). In univariableanalysis, CD146 expression was a prognostic factor for both metastasis-freesurvival (MFS) (p = 0.020) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.037), but not inmultivariable analysis (including age, tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor (ER),progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) andKi-67). No correlation between CD146 and EMT nor difference in outcome tofirst-line tamoxifen was seen. In this large series, our data showed that CD146is present in primary breast cancer and is a pure prognostic factor for MFS andOS in breast cancer patients. We did not see an association between CD146expression and EMT nor on outcome to tamoxifen.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10050134 PMCID: PMC5977107PMID: 29734758
