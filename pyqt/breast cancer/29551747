In this study, doxorubicin (DOX) and imatinib (IM) wereco-loaded into folate receptor targeted (FR-targeted) pH-sensitive liposomes(denoted as FPL-DOX/IM) to fulfill intracellular acid-sensitive release andreverse drug resistance. FPL-DOX/IM could maintain stability in blood circulationwith approximate diameters of 100 nm and rapidly release encapsulated drugs intumor acidic microenvironment. Moreover, the IM in combination therapy couldovercome chemoresistance associated with DOX effectively by inhibiting ABCtransporter function and improving chemotherapy sensitivity. The designedliposomes co-loaded with DOX and IM significantly enhanced anti-tumor effectsboth in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that FPL-DOX/IM provides anovel strategy to improve chemotherapeutic efficacy against MDR tumors.Copyright © 2018.
