DNA methylation, an epigenetic event, plays animportant role in cancer susceptibility. In this paper, we use DNA methylationand gene expression data integration and pathway analysis to further explore and understand the complex relationship between methylation and gene expression.Results: Through linear modeling and analysis of variance, we obtain genes thatshow a significant correlation between methylation and gene expression. We thenexamine the functions and relationships of these genes using bioinformatic tools and databases. In particular, using ConsensusPathDB, we analyze the networks ofstatistically significant genes to identify hub genes, genes with a large number of links to other genes. We identify eight major hub genes, all in strongassociation with cancer susceptibility. Through further analysis of the function,gene expression level, and methylation level of these hub genes, we conclude thatthey are novel potential biomarkers for breast cancer.Conclusions: Our findings have various implications for cancer screening, earlydetection methods, and potential novel treatments for cancer. Researchers canalso use our results to develop more effective methods for cancer study.DOI: 10.1186/s13040-018-0174-8 PMCID: PMC6019806PMID: 29983747
