The DCISionRT biologic signature developed inthis study provides recurrence risk and predicts radiation therapy (RT) benefitfor DCIS patients following breast conserving surgery (BCS).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A biologic signature that calculates an individualizedDecision Score (DS) was developed and cross-validated in 526 DCIS patientstreated with BCS ±RT. The relationship was assessed between DS and 10-year riskof invasive breast cancer (IBC) or any ipsilateral breast event (IBE), including IBC or DCIS. RT benefit was evaluated by risk group and as a function of DS.RESULTS: The DS was significantly associated with IBC and IBE risk, HR (per 5units) of 4.2 and 3.1, respectively. For patients treated without RT, DSidentified a Low Group with 10-year IBC risk of 4% (7% IBE) and an Elevated Groupwith IBC risk of 15% (23% IBE). In analysis of DS and RT by Group, the ElevatedGroup received significant RT benefit, HR of 0.3 for IBC and IBE. In aclinicopathologically low risk subset, DS reclassified 42% of patients into theElevated Group. In an interaction analysis of DS and RT, patients with elevatedDS had significant RT benefit over baseline.CONCLUSIONS: The DS was prognostic for risk and predicted RT benefit for DCISpatients. DS identified a clinically meaningful low risk group, and a group with elevated 10-year risks that received substantial RT benefit over baseline.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0842 PMID: 30054280
