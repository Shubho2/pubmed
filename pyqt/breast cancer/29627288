Axial,sagittal, or coronal fat-suppressed T2-weighted (T2WI), T1-weighted (T1WI), andDWI images were acquired. Total MRI acquisition and set-up time was approximately45 minutes. Metastatic disease on MRI was confirmed based on T2WIcharacteristics. The number of lesions was established on computed tomography(CT) or positron emission tomography (PET-CT). Whole-body ADC maps and T2WI were constructed, and region-of-interests were drawn in normal and abnormal-appearing tissue for quantitative analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using apaired t tests and P < .05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: There were 91 metastatic lesions detected from the CT or PET-CT with amissed recurrent lesion in the prostate. Multiparametric WB-MRI had excellentsensitivity (96%) for detection of metastatic lesions compared to CT. ADC mapvalues and the ADC ratio in metastatic bone lesions were significantly increased (P < .05) compared to normal bone. In soft tissue, ADC map values and ratios inmetastatic lesions were decreased compared to normal soft tissue.CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that multiparametric WB-MRI is feasible foroncologic staging to identify bony and visceral metastasis in breast, prostate,pancreatic, and colorectal cancers. WB-MRI can be tailored to fit the patient,such that an "individualized patient sequence" can be developed for acomprehensive evaluation for staging and response during treatment.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.
