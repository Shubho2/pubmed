But pre-clinical studies are reporting both itsradioprotective and radiosensitizing properties, possibly mediated through aninteraction between melatonin and the regulation of estrogens. Melatoninpre-treatment prior to ionizing radiation was associated with a decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in p53 mRNA expression, leading to an increase inthe radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells. At the same time, a decrease inradiation-induced side effects was described in breast cancer patients and inrodent models. This review examines the potential for melatonin to improve thetherapeutic outcomes of breast radiation therapy, specifically estrogen receptor positive patients. Evidence suggests that melatonin may offer a novel, non-toxic and cheap adjuvant therapy to improve the existing treatment modalities. Butfurther research is required in the clinical setting before a clear understandingof its therapeutic benefits is determined.DOI: 10.1080/09553002.2018.1446227 PMID: 29521142
