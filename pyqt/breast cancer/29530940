Theyblock estrogen biosynthesis through aromatase inhibition, thus preventing tumour progression. Besides the therapeutic success of the third-generation AIs,acquired resistance may develop, leading to tumour relapse. This resistance isthought to be the result of a change in the behaviour of ER in these breastcancer cells, presumably by PI3K/AKT pathway enhancement along with alterationsin other signalling pathways. Nevertheless, biological mechanisms, such asapoptosis, autophagy, cell cycle modulation and activation of androgen receptor(AR), are also implicated in acquired resistance. Moreover, clinical evidencedemonstrated that there is a lack of cross-resistance among AIs, although thereason is not fully understood. Thus, there is a demand to understand themechanisms involved in endocrine resistance to each AI, since the search for new strategies to surpass breast cancer acquired resistance is of major concern.Â© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-17-0425 PMID: 29530940
