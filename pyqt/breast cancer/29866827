Here, we demonstrate accuratesubtyping from molecular properties of epithelial cells using emerginghigh-definition Fourier transform infrared (HD FT-IR) spectroscopic imagingcombined with machine learning algorithms. In addition to detecting fourepithelial subtypes, we simultaneously delineate three stromal subtypes thatcharacterize breast tumors. While FT-IR imaging data enable fully digitalpathology with rich information content, the long spectral scanning timesrequired for signal averaging and processing make the technology impractical for routine research or clinical use. Hence, we developed a confocal design in which refractive IR optics are designed to provide high-definition, rapid spatialscanning and discrete spectral tuning using a quantum cascade laser (QCL) source.This instrument provides simultaneously high resolving power (2-μm pixel size)and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (>1,300), providing a speed increase of∼50-fold for obtaining classified results compared with present imagingspectrometers. We demonstrate spectral fidelity and interinstrument operabilityof our developed instrument by accurate analysis of a 100-case breast tissue set that was analyzed in a day, considerably speeding research. Clinical breastbiopsies typical of a patients' caseload are analyzed in ∼1 hour. This studypaves the way for comprehensive tumor-microenvironment analyses in feasible time periods, presenting a critical step in practical label-free molecularhistopathology.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).
