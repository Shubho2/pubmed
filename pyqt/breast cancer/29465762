Whereas various anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)drugs have been developed, trastuzumab is still the only anti-HER2 drug presentlyavailable for gastric cancer. In this study, we propose novel treatment optionsfor patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. First, we determined themolecular profiles of 12 gastric cancer cell lines, and examined the antitumoreffect of the pan-HER inhibitors afatinib and neratinib in those cell lines.Additionally, we analyzed HER2 alteration in 123 primary gastric cancers resectedfrom Japanese patients to clarify possible candidates with the potential torespond to these drugs. In the drug sensitivity analysis, both afatinib andneratinib produced an antitumor effect in most of the HER2-amplified cell lines. However, some cells were not sensitive to the drugs. When the molecular profiles of the cells were compared based on the drug sensitivities, we found that cancer cells with lower mRNA expression levels of IGFBP7, a tumor suppressor gene thatinhibits the activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), wereless sensitive to pan-HER inhibitors. A combination therapy consisting of pan-HERinhibitors and an IGF-1R inhibitor, picropodophyllin, showed a notablesynergistic effect. Among 123 clinical samples, we found 19 cases of HER2amplification and three cases of oncogenic mutations. In conclusion, afatinib andneratinib are promising therapeutic options for the treatment of HER2-amplifiedgastric cancer. In addition to HER2 amplification, IGFBP7 might be a biomarker ofsensitivity to these drugs, and IGF-1R-targeting therapy can overcome druginsensitiveness in HER2-amplified gastric cancer.Â© 2018 The Authors.
