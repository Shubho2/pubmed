Multivariable logisticregression analysis was performed to assess clinical factors associated with boneloss.RESULTS: Of the 238 women in the final cohort, 20 women had intact ovaries(median age 54.5years) and 218 had undergone risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) (median age 57). The prevalence of bone loss was 55% in the no RRSO group and 72.5% in the RRSO group (P=0.10). In multivariable analysis, only higher bodymass index (OR 0.6 per 5kg/m2, 95% CI: 0.4-0.7) and nonwhite race compared towhite (OR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.2-0.9) were protective for bone loss while older age (OR1.5 per 10years, 95% CI: 1.1-2.1) and selective estrogen receptor modulator use(3.1, 95% CI: 1.2-10.1) were associated with increased odds of bone loss. Amongwomen with RRSO, bone loss was more frequent in women who had postmenopausal(n=106) compared to women who had premenopausal RRSO (n=112), (82.1% and 63.4%respectively, P=0.002). In multivariable analysis, only BMI was protective ofbone loss (OR 0.5, 95%, CI: 0.4-0.7) but neither age nor menopausal status atRRSO were associated with bone loss.CONCLUSION: Bone loss is common in women with BRCA mutations who undergo RRSO.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
