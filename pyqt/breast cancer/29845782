Epub 2018 May 15.Breast Cancer Heterogeneity: A focus on Epigenetics and In Vitro 3D ModelSystems.Suresh PK(1).Author information: (1)Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Biosciences and Technology,Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.Electronic Address:p.k.suresh@vit.ac.in.Breast cancer (BC) is a widely prevalent form of neoplasia in women with fairlyalarming mortality statistics. This aspect may be attributed, in part, to thecurrent spatial and temporal heterogeneity-based limitations in therapies withpossible recurrence of this tumour at primary and/or secondary sites. Such anextensive phenotypic heterogeneity in breast cancer is unlikely to be adequately or completely comprehended by an immuno-histopathology-based classificationalone. This finding has warranted research and development in the area ofmicroarray-based methods (i.e. transcriptomic and proteomic chips) for animproved molecular classification of this complex and heterogeneous tumour.Further, since epigenetics can also be an important determinant in terms ofdiagnosis, prognosis and therapy, this review provides an insight into themolecular portrait of BC in genetic and epigenetic terms. Specifically, the rolesof characteristic DNA and histone-based modifications as well as mi-RNAbasedalterations have been discussed with specific examples. Also, their involvementin epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes in cancer stem cells (CSCs) has been outlined. Last but not least, the salient aspects and the advantages of ex vivo/in vitro 3D model systems in recapitulating several aspects of BC tumour (particularly the architecture as well as the apico-basal polarity) arementioned. This review hopes to provide not only an improved and updatedunderstanding of the epigenetics of breast cancer, but to also elaborate ontumour model development/refinement, biomarker evaluation, drug resistance andtest of individual drugs or drug combinations and drug delivery systems.CopyrightÂ© by Royan Institute.
