In the latter case, chemotherapy is preferred. Few studieshave compared these two strategies. We used the Epidemiological Strategy andMedical Economics (ESME) programme, UNICANCER, a large national observationaldatabase (NCT03275311), to address this question.METHODS: All patients who initiated treatment for a newly diagnosed HR+HER2-negative MBC between January 2008 and December 2014 in any of the 18 French Comprehensive Cancer Centers participating to ESME were selected. Patients shouldbe aromatase inhibitor (AI)-sensitive (no previous AI or relapse occurring morethan 1 year after last adjuvant AI). Objectives of the study were evaluation ofprogression-free and overall survival (OS) according to the type of first-linetreatment adjusted on main prognostic factors using a propensity score.RESULTS: Six thousand two hundred sixty-five patients were selected: 2733 (43.6%)received endocrine therapy alone, while 3532 (56.4%) received chemotherapy asfirst-line therapy. Among the latter, 2073 (58.7%) received maintenance endocrinetherapy. Median OS was 60.78 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 57.16-64.09)and 49.64 months (95% CI, 47.31-51.64; p < 0.0001) for patients receivingendocrine therapy alone and chemotherapy ± maintenance endocrine therapy,respectively. However, this difference was not significant after adjusting on thepropensity score (hazard ratio: 0.943, 95% CI 0.863-1.030, p = 0.19).CONCLUSION: In this large retrospective cohort of patients with AI-sensitivemetastatic luminal BC, OS was similar, whether first-line treatment waschemotherapy or endocrine therapy. In agreement with international guidelines,endocrine therapy should be the first choice for first-line systemic treatmentfor MBC in the absence of visceral crisis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
