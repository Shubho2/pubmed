As this combination does not lead tosignificant hepatic metabolism, in some clinical situations it may prove useful, especially in cases with liver dysfunction and an urgent clinical need for rapid tumor shrinkage. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy andsafety of the combination of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in patients withmetastatic breast cancer with significant alterations of biochemistry.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 109 patients with metastatic breast cancer andliver dysfunction were treated; time-to-progression, overall survival and trends in liver function were evaluated.RESULTS: The median time-to-progression was 3.4 months, and median overallsurvival was 7.8 months. About 50% of patients obtained a complete, partial orstable biochemical response and 24 patients were subsequently able to receiveadditional therapies.CONCLUSION: Our results show that this therapeutic doublet represents aclinically effective, safe and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with metastatic breast cancer and liver dysfunction.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12795 PMID: 30061257  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
