EPconstitutes 3% of all plasma cell tumors. Most of the cases of EP occur in thehead and neck regions, especially in the aerodigestive tract. We present a caseof recurrent epistaxis for 6Â months and extensive workup revealed EP of the rightnasal cavity. Primary care physicians and otolaryngologists should be aware ofthis very rare but a plausible cause of epistaxis and keep EP in the differentialdiagnosis of recurrent epistaxis.DOI: 10.1080/00325481.2018.1502015 PMID: 30016897
