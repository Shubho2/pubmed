The aim of this population-based study was to assess andcompare the efficacy and patient satisfaction of standard breast-conservationsurgery with oncoplastic breast-conservation surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a population-based, retrospective, observationalcohort study on all women undergoing breast-conservation surgery in Iceland from the 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2014. A multivariate logistic regression andlinear regression were performed to assess differences in outcomes and a patient satisfaction questionnaire was used to assess certain patient-related outcomemeasures.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 750 women underwent breast-conserving surgery,665 had standard breast-conservation surgery and 85 oncoplasticbreast-conservation surgery. Oncoplastic breast-conservation surgery wasassociated with a significantly larger mean size (2.4 cm vs 1.7 cm, p < 0.001)and weight (181.8 g vs 63.4 g, p < 0.001) of breast specimen excised whencompared to standard breast-conservation surgery. After correcting forconfounding factors, there was no significant difference in surgical margininvolvement (odds ratio = 0.97, confidence interval = 0.44-1.97), frequency ofcomplications (odds ratio = 1.06, confidence interval = 0.46-2.18), frequency of reoperations (odds ratio = 0.98; confidence interval = 0.50-1.81), or time tofirst adjuvant therapy (-0.23 days for oncoplastic breast-conservation surgery,p = 0.95). Patient satisfaction was high in both groups, although notstatistically different (96% in oncoplastic breast-conservation surgery group vs 89% in the standard breast-conservation surgery group, p = 0.84). Our resultsshow that oncoplastic breast-conservation surgery is at least as safe as standardbreast-conservation surgery in selected cases and may be preferable in ductalcarcinoma in situ.DOI: 10.1177/1457496918766686 PMID: 29756510
