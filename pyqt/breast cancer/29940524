Electronic address: grazia.arpino@unina.it.Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents the 15-20% of all breast cancers (BC) and is characterized by a very aggressive behavior. Recent data suggest thatTNBC is not a single disease, but it is rather an umbrella for differentontology-profiles such as basal like 1 and 2, mesenchymal, and the luminalandrogen receptor (LAR). The LAR subtype is characterized by the expression ofthe Androgen Receptor (AR) and its downstream effects. Notwithstanding the roleof the AR in several signaling pathways, its impact on a biological and clinical standpoint is still controversial. The LAR subtype has been associated withbetter prognosis, less chemotherapy responsiveness and lower pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant treatment. Clinical evidence suggests a role foranti-androgen therapies such as bicalutamide, enzalutamide and abiraterone,offering an interesting chemo-free alternative for chemo-unresponsive patients,and therefore potentially shifting current treatment strategies.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
