Hence, we propose a deeplearning-based HER2 deep neural network (Her2Net) to solve this issue. Theconvolutional and deconvolutional parts of the proposed Her2Net frameworkconsisted mainly of multiple convolution layers, max-pooling layers, spatialpyramid pooling layers, deconvolution layers, up-sampling layers, and trapezoidallong short-term memory (TLSTM). A fully connected layer and a softmax layer were also used for classification and error estimation. Finally, HER2 scores werecalculated based on the classification results. The main contribution of ourproposed Her2Net framework includes the implementation of TLSTM and a deeplearning framework for cell membrane and nucleus detection, segmentation, andclassification and HER2 scoring. Our proposed Her2Net achieved 96.64% precision, 96.79% recall, 96.71% F-score, 93.08% negative predictive value, 98.33% accuracy,and a 6.84% false-positive rate. Our results demonstrate the high accuracy andwide applicability of the proposed Her2Net in the context of HER2 scoring forbreast cancer evaluation.DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2018.2795742 PMID: 29432100
