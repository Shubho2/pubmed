This study aimed to assess theprecision of ultrasound (US) for predicting pathologic complete response(pCR = ypT0) after NACT.METHODS: This retrospective mono-center study included 124 invasive breast cancerpatients treated with NACT. Patients received US before and after NACT withdocumentation of clinical partial response (cPR) and clinical complete response(cCR). Post-operatively, the pathologic response was defined as absence of tumor cells (ypT0), presence of non-invasive tumor cells (ypTis) or invasive tumorcells (ypTinv). Sensitivity and specificity of US as well as false negative rate (FNR), negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) wereanalysed for receptor subtypes. A multivariable logistic regression modelassessed the influence of patient- and tumor-associated covariates as predictors for pCR.RESULTS: 50 patients (40.3%) achieved pCR, 39 (78.0%) had a corresponding cCR.Overall sensitivity was 60.8% and specificity 78.0% for US-predicted remission.NPV and FNR differed substantially between subtypes. NPV was highest (75.0%) intriple negative (TN) subtype, while FNR was low (37.5%). Therefore, pathological response was most accurately predicted for TN cancers. NPV forhuman-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor-2-positive/hormone-receptor-positive(HER2+/HR+) was 55.6%, for HER2+/HR- 64.3% and for HER2-/HR+ 16.7%, FNRs were40.0%, 71.4% and 32.3%, respectively. Receptor subtypes impacted pCRsignificantly (p-value: 0.0033), cCR correlated positively with pCR (p-value:0.0026).CONCLUSION: US imaging is insufficient to predict pCR with adequate accuracy.Receptor subtypes, however, affect diagnostic precision of US and pathologicoutcome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
