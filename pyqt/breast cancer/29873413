The combined effect of genetic variants in genes of this pathway may have a causal role in breast cancerdevelopment. We examined 7086 SNPs that were not highly correlated (r2  < 0.8) in35 Hippo pathway genes using data from the genome-wide association study ofbreast cancer from the Root Consortium, which includes 3686 participants ofAfrican ancestry from Nigeria, United States of America, and Barbados: 1657 cases(403 estrogen receptor-positive [ER+], 374 ER-) and 2029 controls. Gene-levelanalyses were conducted using improved AdaJoint test for large-scale geneticassociation studies adjusting for age, study site and the first four eigenvectorsfrom the principal component analysis. SNP-level analyses were conducted withlogistic regression. The Hippo pathway was significantly associated with risk of ER+ breast cancer (pathway-level P = 0.019), with WWC1 (Padj  = 0.04) being theleading gene. The pathway-level significance was lost without WWC1 (P = 0.12).rs147106204 in the WWC1 gene was the most statistically significant SNP aftergene-level adjustment for multiple comparisons (OR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.41-0.70,Padj  = 0.025). We found evidence of an association between genetic variations inthe Hippo pathway and ER+ breast cancer. Moreover, WWC1 was identified as themost important genetic susceptibility locus highlighting the importance ofgenetic epidemiology studies of breast cancer in understudied populations.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/mc.22845 PMID: 29873413
