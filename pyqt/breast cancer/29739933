Here we show through whole-exome and targeted massively parallelsequencing analysis that whilst estrogen receptor (ER)-positiveadenomyoepitheliomas display PIK3CA or AKT1 activating mutations, ER-negativeadenomyoepitheliomas harbor highly recurrent codon Q61 HRAS hotspot mutations,which co-occur with PIK3CA or PIK3R1 mutations. In two- and three-dimensionalcell culture models, forced expression of HRASQ61R in non-malignant ER-negativebreast epithelial cells with or without a PIK3CAH1047R somatic knock-in resultsin transformation and the acquisition of the cardinal features ofadenomyoepitheliomas, including the expression of myoepithelial markers, areduction in E-cadherin expression, and an increase in AKT signaling. Our resultsdemonstrate that adenomyoepitheliomas are genetically heterogeneous, and qualify mutations in HRAS, a gene whose mutations are vanishingly rare in common-typebreast cancers, as likely drivers of ER-negative adenomyoepitheliomas.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04128-5 PMCID: PMC5940840PMID: 29739933
