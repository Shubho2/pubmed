R. China.A photosensitizer with high phototoxicity, low dark toxicity, and good watersolubility is crucial for effective photodynamic therapy (PDT). In this study, a novel class of porphyrin-based water-soluble derivative and its isomers, namedphotohexer-1 (P-1) and photohexer-2 (P-2), were synthesized and investigated for anticancer activity. Both of the isomers, P-1 and P-2, could be utilized aspotential sensitizers for PDT not only owing to their definite constituents butpredominantly due to their good absorption in the phototherapeutic window andhigh generation of intracellular ROS. Therein, P-2 exhibited strongerphototoxicity against breast cancer cells with weaker dark toxicity than P-1;however, both P-1 and P-2 were highly phototoxic as compared to their homologous compound, hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME). These findings were consistentwith the antitumor efficacy in vivo. Moreover, P-1 and P-2 could both effectivelylocalize in multiple subcellular organelles, triggering increased cellularapoptosis or necrosis under laser irradiation as compared to HMME. In conclusion,the findings of the study suggest that the two highly water-soluble porphyrinderivatives may serve as promising putative photosensitizers for improving thetherapeutic efficiency of PDT.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00547 PMID: 30048595
