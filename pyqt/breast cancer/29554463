Since the advent of screening mammography in the 1980's, the incidence ofDCIS has increased dramatically. The value of screen detection and treatment ofDCIS, however, is a matter of controversy, as it is unclear the extent to whichdetection and treatment of DCIS prevents invasive disease and reduces breastcancer mortality. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of existingCancer Intervention and Surveillance Modelling Network (CISNET) modelingapproaches for the natural history of DCIS, and to compare these to othermodeling approaches reported in the literature.DESIGN: Five of the 6 CISNET models currently include DCIS. Most models assumethat some, but not all, lesions progress to invasive cancer. The natural history of DCIS cannot be directly observed and the CISNET models differ in theirassumptions and in the data sources used to estimate the DCIS model parameters.RESULTS: These model differences translate into variation in outcomes, such asthe amount of overdiagnosis of DCIS, with estimates ranging from 34% to 72% forbiennial screening from ages 50 to 74 y. The other models described in theliterature also report a large range in outcomes, with progression rates varying from 20% to 91%.LIMITATIONS: DCIS grade was not yet included in the CISNET models.CONCLUSION: In the future, DCIS data by grade from active surveillance trials,the development of predictive markers of progression probability, and evidencefrom other screening modalities, such as tomosynthesis, may be used to inform andimprove the models' representation of DCIS, and might lead to convergence of the model estimates. Until then, the CISNET model results consistently show aconsiderable amount of overdiagnosis of DCIS, supporting the safety and value of observational trials for low-risk DCIS.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X17729358 PMCID: PMC5862063 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29554463
