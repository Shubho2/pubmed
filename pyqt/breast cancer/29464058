In this study, we demonstratethat trastuzumab downregulates both gene and protein expressions of type IIB DNA topoisomerase/DNA topoisomerase IIB (TOP2B), a major intracellular targetmediating doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, in human primary cardiomyocytes.This in turn induces DNA damage activity and DNA double strand breaks, which isindicated by the enhanced phosphorylation of H2AX (Î³H2AX) and ataxiatelangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR pS428) in trastuzumab-treatedcardiomyocytes. Furthermore, concurrent or sequential treatment of doxorubicinand trastuzumab significantly increases the downregulation of the protein levels of TOP2B, enhances apoptosis and cell growth inhibition, and promotes production of reactive oxidative and nitrative species in human cardiomyocytes as comparedto either trastuzumab or doxorubicin treatment, indicating augmentation ofcardiotoxicity in combination therapy. Additionally, our data reveal thatdoxorubicin treatment increases the levels of ErbB2/HER2 expression in humancardiomyocytes as compared with that in cells not treated with doxorubicin,leading to the enhanced activity downstream of HER2 signaling. Consequently, thismay render the cardiomyocytes to become addicted to HER2 signaling for survivalunder stressed conditions. Enhanced HER2 protein expression leaves cardiomyocytesmore sensitive to trastuzumab treatment after doxorubicin exposure. This studyprovides molecular basis for significantly increased cardiotoxicity in cancerpatients who are treated with anthracyclines and trastuzumab-based combinationregimens.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23543 PMCID: PMC5814198PMID: 29464058
