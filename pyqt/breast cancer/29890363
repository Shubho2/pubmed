Thegoals of this study are to develop an exosome platform that can target regions oftumor hypoxia and that can be monitored in vivo using magnetic particle imaging(MPI). Four types of exosomes (generated under hypoxic or normoxic conditions,and with or without exposure to X-ray radiation) were isolated from MDA-MB-231human breast cancer cells. Exosomes were labeled by DiO, a fluorescent lipophilictracer, to quantify their uptake by hypoxic cancer cells. Subsequently, theexosomes were modified to carry SPIO (superparamagnetic iron oxide) nanoparticlesand Olaparib (PARP inhibitor). FACS and fluorescence microscopy showed thathypoxic cells preferentially take up exosomes released by hypoxic cells, comparedwith other exosome formulations. In addition, the distribution of SPIO-labeledexosomes was successively imaged in vivo using MPI. Finally, the therapeuticefficacy of Olaparib-loaded exosomes was demonstrated by increased apoptosis and slower tumor growth in vivo. Our novel theranostic platform could be used as aneffective strategy to monitor exosomes in vivo and deliver therapeutics tohypoxic tumors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
