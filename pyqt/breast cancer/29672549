This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of tumors developing inLS patients.METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 55 LS patients treated at TokyoMetropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital.RESULTS: The median age at the diagnosis of the first malignant tumor and firstLS-related tumor was 44 (range, 19-65) and 44 (range, 24-66) years, respectively.Of the 55 LS patients with developing malignant tumors, 45 (93.8%) developed anLS-related tumor as the first malignant tumor. Colorectal cancer (CRC) developed in 47 patients (85.4%), followed by endometrial cancer (n = 13, 56.5%) in femalesand gastric cancer (n = 10, 18.1%). In 6 gastric cancer patients, Helicobacterpylori was detected in resected specimens. Twenty-nine patients (52.7%) developedCRC and extra-colonic tumors; of these, 15 patients (48.3%) had mutations inMLH1, 10 (58.8%) in MSH2, and 4 (57.1%) in MSH6. At the age of 50, the cumulativeincidence was 50.9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 36.9-63.3%] for CRC, 17.4%(95% CI, 5.2-35.6%) for endometrial cancer, and 5.5% (95% CI, 1.4-13.8%) forgastric cancer. Eight gastric cancer, one breast cancer patient, five bladdercancer patients, and one prostate cancer patient demonstrated loss of expression of the mismatch repair (MMR) protein; patients with thyroid cancer, spindle cell sarcoma, and giant cell tumors did not demonstrate this.CONCLUSION: Gastric cancer incidence was high in Japanese patients with LS andassociated with H. pylori infection. MMR protein deficiency caused thedevelopment of malignant tumors in LS patients.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195572 PMCID: PMC5908237PMID: 29672549  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
