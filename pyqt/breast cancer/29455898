A contentanalysis of interactions between women with breast cancer and their therapeuticradiographers.Barracliffe L(1), Yang Y(2), Cameron J(3), Bedi C(3), Humphris G(4).Author information: (1)School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, UK.(2)Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Southern Medical University, Nanfang Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, China.(3)Edinburgh Cancer Centre, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.(4)School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, UK; Edinburgh Cancer Centre,Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK. Electronic address:gmh4@st-andrews.ac.uk.Fears of cancer recurrence (FCR) in patients with breast cancer are hypothesised to develop over the period from diagnosis, through treatment and thereafter. Acrucial point may be the contact that patients have with their therapeuticradiographer in review appointments. The study aimed to (1) describe andcategorise the content of the identified emotional talk, and (2) consider theevidence for an association of content with FCR trajectory.METHODS: A concurrent mixed methods approach was applied as part of a larger investigation (FORECAST)of breast cancer patients (n=87). Patients completed a daily diary during theirradiotherapy treatment. Audio recordings were collected of review appointments.The Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences (VR-CoDES) system was usedto code patient emotional cues and concerns (CCs). Purposeful sampling of thedaily diary ratings identified 12 patients (30 consultations) with an increasing (n=6) or decreasing (n=6) FCR trajectory. The emotional talk of these patients attheir weekly reviews was content analysed.RESULTS: Four themes were identified from 185 CCs: Physical Symptoms, FactorsExternal to Hospital, Treatment, and Labelling Cancer. FCR decreasing trajectory group consultations were longer (p<0.02), expressed twice as many CCs as theincreasing trajectory group (p<0.001), and were more likely to refer to cancerdirectly (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The emotional content expressed matched features outlined in theLee-Jones et al. (1997) FCR model, and showed evidence of avoidance in increasingFCR trajectory patients.Copyright Â© 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2018.01.004 PMID: 29455898
