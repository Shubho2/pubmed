We compared TIL levels and the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.METHODS: We evaluated the percentage of stromal TILs in 198ER-positive/HER2-negative patients in whom RS was obtained by examining slides ofsurgical specimens by standardized methodology proposed by the international TIL Working Group. TIL levels were categorized as high (≥ 60%), intermediate(11-59%), or low (≤ 10%). All tumors were treatment-naïve.RESULTS: Ninety-seven (49.0%), 88 (44.4%), and 13 patients (6.6%) had low,intermediate, and high TIL levels, respectively. There was a significant but weakcorrelation between continuous RS and continuous TIL levels (Pearson's R = 0.201,p = 0.004). The mean RS was significantly highest in high TIL tumors (17.8 ± 10.7in low TIL tumors, 19.4 ± 8.7 in intermediate TIL tumors, and 26.2 ± 8.2 in high TIL tumors; p = 0.014). However, when we compared categorized RS and TIL levels, we found that tumors with high TIL levels tended to have higher RS (≥ 26) but it was not significant (p = 0.155). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed thathigh RS was not an independent factor associated with high TIL levels.Chemo-endocrine therapy was more frequently performed among patients with highTILs and less frequently among those with low or intermediate TILs (p <  0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Despite of a weak correlation between continuous TIL levels and RS, we found that tumors with high TIL levels tended to have a higher RS inER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Further study is warranted consideringthe clinical outcomes.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4228-6 PMCID: PMC5866511PMID: 29573739
