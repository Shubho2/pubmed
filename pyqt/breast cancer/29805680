The presentstudy investigated the usefulness of exosome-encapsulated microRNA-223-3p(miR-223-3p) as a biomarker for detecting IDC in patients initially diagnosedwith DCIS by biopsy. The potential association between miR-223-3p andclinicopathological characteristics was examined in patients with breast cancer. Exosomes of 185 patients with breast cancer were separated from plasma byultracentrifugation. Initially a microRNA (miRNA) microarray was examined toreveal the invasion specific miRNAs using exosomes collected from 6 patients withbreast cancer, including 3 DCIS patients, 3 IDC patients and 3 healthy controls. In the miR microarray analysis the miR-223-3p levels of IDC patients demonstratedthe highest fold-change compared with those in the DCIS patients and healthycontrols. The potential of miR-223-3p for cell proliferation and cell invasionwere examined in vitro using MCF7 cells transfected with the miR-223-3p gene.MCF7 cells transfected with the miR-223-3p gene significantly promoted cellproliferation and cell invasive ability (P<0.05). The plasma exosomal miR-223-3p levels of the other 179 patients with breast cancer and 20 healthy controls were measured using TaqMan miR assays. The exosomal miR-223-3p levels of the patients with breast cancer were significantly increased compared with the healthycontrols (P<0.01). A statistically significant association was observed betweenthe exosomal miR-223-3p levels and histological type, pT stage, pN stage,pathological stage, lymphatic invasion and nuclear grade (P<0.05). The exosomalmiR-223-3p levels of IDC patients (stage I) and upstaged IDC patients (stage I)were significantly higher compared with the DCIS patients (P<0.05). These resultssuggest that exosomal miR-223-3p may be a useful preoperative biomarker toidentify the invasive lesions of DCIS patients diagnosed by biopsy. In addition, plasma exosome-encapsulated miR-223-3p level was significantly associated withthe malignancy of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8457 PMCID: PMC5958689PMID: 29805680
