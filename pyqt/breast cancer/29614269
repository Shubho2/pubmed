Electronic address: pharma12@zju.edu.cn.In recent years, a large amount of clinical and experimental data has shown that M2-like polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an important role incancer metastasis. Therefore, TAMs, especially M2-like TAMs is a promising targetfor anti-tumor metastasis therapy. Here, we found that celastrol dose-dependentlysuppressed IL-13 induced CD206 expression both in RAW264.7 and in primarymacrophages. Consistently, celastrol also inhibited the expression of M2-likespecific genes, including MRC1, Arg1, Fizz1, Mgl2 and CD11c. Further, by theemployment of 4T1 breast cancer model, we found that celastrol significantlyprevented cancer metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, celastrol completelyameliorated STAT6 phosphorylation, which is the key signal molecule responsiblefor M2 polarization. Our research puts forward a new application of celastrol in anti-cancer metastasis, by intervening M2-like polarization through inhibitingSTAT6.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
