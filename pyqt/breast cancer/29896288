Twohundred forty-two stage II NPC patients were enrolled between May 2008 and April 2014 and received radical IMRT with simultaneous integrated boost technique using6 MV photons; some patient groups also received chemotherapy every 3 weeks for2-3 cycles. The median follow-up duration was 69 months for all patients. At the last follow-up, 18 patients had experienced treatment failure; locoregionalrelapse among the IMRT alone, NAC+IMRT, NAC+CCRT, and CCRT occurred in 3, 3, 4and 5, respectively; distant metastases in 0, 0, 2 and 1, respectively, and therewas a statistically significant difference among four groups (P=0.019). The5-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-freesurvival (DMFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) ratesfor all patients were 94.7%, 98.7%, 92.9%, and 93.4%, respectively. Five-yearLRRFS, DMFS, PFS, and OS were similar among the IMRT alone, NAC+IMRT, NAC+CCRT,and CCRT treatment groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that acombined regimen was not an independent prognostic factor for any survivaloutcome. However, patients who received IMRT plus chemotherapy experienced moreacute adverse events than those who received IMRT alone. Thus, the addition ofNAC and/or CC to IMRT did not improve survival outcomes, but was associated with higher incidences of acute treatment-associated toxicities than IMRT alone inpatients with stage II NPC.DOI: 10.7150/jca.25042 PMCID: PMC5995949PMID: 29896288
