There were 2552 individual responses for FISH and 1871individual responses for brightfield ISH. Consensus response rates werecomparable for FISH (2474 of 2524; 98.0%) and brightfield ISH (2135 of 2189;97.5%). The FISH analysis yielded an average HER2 copy number per cell that wassignificantly higher (by 2.86; P = .02) compared with brightfield ISH foramplified cores. For nonamplified cores, FISH yielded slightly, but notsignificantly, higher (by 0.17; P = .10) HER2 copy numbers per cell. There was nosignificant difference in the average HER2 to control ratio for eitherconsensus-amplified or consensus-nonamplified cores. Participants reported"unable to analyze" more frequently for brightfield ISH (244 of 2453; 9.9%) than they did for FISH (160 of 2684; 6.0%).CONCLUSIONS: - Our study indicates a high concordance rate in proficiency testingsurveys, with some significant differences noted in the technical performance of these assays. In borderline cases, updated American Society of ClinicalOncology/College of American Pathologists cutoff thresholds that place greateremphasis on HER2 copy number per cell could accentuate those differences between FISH and brightfield ISH.DOI: 10.5858/arpa.2017-0457-CP PMID: 29733681
