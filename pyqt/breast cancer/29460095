All patients had well-demarcated movable breast masses. Ultrasonography showed circumscribedmasses suggesting benign tumors in all cases, and mammography revealedwell-defined, high-density masses, with or without calcification. The massesprogressed in two patients. A preoperative histological diagnosis of carcinomawas made following needle biopsy in four patients. Tumorectomy, breast-conservingsurgery, and mastectomy were performed in three, two, and two patients,respectively. One patient underwent lymph node dissection and another underwentsentinel node biopsy. Histologically, the masses were diagnosed as invasiveductal carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ, arising in a benign phyllodes tumor, fibroadenoma, or fibroadenomatoid mastopathy. Lymph node metastasis was detected in two patients. There was no recurrence in any ofthe patients.CONCLUSIONS: Although a carcinoma within a preexisting benign fibroepithelialtumor is extremely rare, it is important to be aware of the possibility ofinvasive and metastatic disease.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0847-7 PMID: 29460095
