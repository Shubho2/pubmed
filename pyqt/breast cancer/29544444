The purpose of this study was to explorethe association of ERCC2 and MTHFR polymorphisms with genetic susceptibility tobreast cancer in Moroccan population.METHODS: We genotyped ERCC2 polymorphisms (rs1799793 (G934A) and rs13181(A2251C)) and MTHFR polymorphisms (rs1801133 (C677T) and rs1801131 (A1298C))using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. Genotypes were compared in 151 BC cases and156 population-matched controls. Allelic, genotypic and haplotype associationswith the risk and clinicopathological features of BC were assessed using logisticregression analyses.RESULTS: ERCC2-rs1799793-AA genotype was associated with high risk of BC comparedto wild type genotype (recessive model: OR: 2.90, 95% CI: 1.34-6.26, p = 0.0069) even after Bonferroni correction (p < 0,0125). MTHFR rs1801133-TT genotype wasassociated with increased risk of BC (recessive model, OR: 2.49, 95% CI:1.17-5.29, p = 0.017) but the association turned insignificant after Bonferronicorrection. For the rest of SNPs, no statistical associations to BC risk weredetected. Significant association with clinical features was detected forMTHFR-rs1801133-TC genotype with early age at diagnosis and familial BC.Following Bonferroni correction, only association with familial BC remainedsignificant. MTHFR-rs1801131-CC genotype was associated with sporadic BC.ERCC2-rs1799793-AA genotype correlated with ER+ and PR+ breast cancer.ERCC2-rs13181-CA genotype was significantly associated large tumors (T ≥ 3) in BCpatients. None of these associations passed Bonferroni correction. Haplotypeanalysis showed that ERCC2 A-C haplotype was significantly associated withincreased BC risk (OR: 3.71, 95% CI: 1.7-8.12, p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0008 beforeand after Bonferroni correction, respectively) and positive expression of ER and PR in BC patients. ERCC2 G-C haplotype was correlated with PR negative and largertumor (T4). We did not find any MTHFR haplotypes associated with BCsusceptibility. However, the less common haplotype MTHFR T-C was more frequent inyoung patients and in familial breast cancer, while MTHFR C-C haplotype wasassociated with sporadic BC form.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are a first observation of association between ERCC2SNPs and breast cancer in Moroccan population. The results suggested that ERCC2and MTHFR polymorphisms may be reliable for assessing risk and prognosis of BC inMoroccan population.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4214-z PMCID: PMC5856390PMID: 29544444
