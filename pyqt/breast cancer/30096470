Secondary breast cancers among childhood cancer survivorshave been well described in the literature but less is known about MBC.PATIENTS AND METHOD: We carried out an analysis in a cohort of 7,019 5-yearsurvivors of a solid childhood (< 20 years) cancer treated in France before 2001 and followed for an average of 20 years and compared breast cancers occurring in both men and women.RESULTS: Among the 7,019 survivors, four out of 3,893 male survivors developedbreast cancer, compared to 99 out of 3,126 female survivors. All the men had apast history of radiotherapy. The four men with MBC had estrogen receptors and 3 had progesterone receptors.CONCLUSION: MBC is a rare second malignancy among childhood cancer survivors.Radiotherapy is a recognized risk factor but more data about eventual geneticmutations is necessary. Regular screening based only on a past history ofradiotherapy is not recommended, however attention must be given in the case ofsuspicious symptoms.Copyright © 2018.
