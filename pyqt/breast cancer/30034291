Macrophages infiltrate tumors, where they are the most abundantimmune cell population and secrete a number of cytokines. Aspirin acts as achemopreventive agent against cancer development. This study investigated whetheraspirin regulates crosstalk between breast cancer cells and macrophages. To studythese interactions in a tumor microenvironment, a conditioned media was employed using 4T1 breast cancer cells cultured in RAW 264.7 cell-conditioned medium(RAW-CM), and a cocultured model of both cells was used. When 4T1 cells werecultured in the RAW-CM, there were increases in cell viability and secretion ofthe cytokines VEGF, PAI-1, TNF-α, and IL-6. Treatment with aspirin inhibited 4T1 cell growth and migration and MCP-1, PAI-1, and IL-6 production. In the cocultureof both cells, aspirin inhibited secretion of MCP-1, IL-6, and TGF-β.Furthermore, aspirin significantly decreased the M2 macrophage marker CD206, but increased M1 marker CD11c expression. In summary, aspirin treatment inhibited thecrosstalk of 4T1 and RAW 264.7 cells through regulation of angiogenic andinflammatory mediator production and influenced the M1/M2 macrophage subtype.This highlighted that aspirin suppresses the tumor favorable microenvironment andcould be a promising agent against triple-negative breast cancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6380643 PMCID: PMC6035832PMID: 30034291
