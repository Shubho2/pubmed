Case definition: (1) presence of a primary nodular lesion inthe breast and (2) cytological or histological documentation of cancer from aprimary or metastatic site.SETTING: Administrative databases from Umbria Region, Azienda Sanitaria Locale(ASL) Napoli 3 Sud (NA) and Friuli VeneziaGiulia (FVG) Region.PARTICIPANTS: Women with breast carcinoma in situ (n=246) or invasive breastcancer (n=384) diagnosed (in primary position) between 2012 and 2014.OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity for codes 233.0 and 174.x.RESULTS: For invasive breast cancer the sensitivities were 98% (95% CI 93% to99%) for Umbria, 96% (95% CI 91% to 99%) for NA and 100% (95% CI 97% to 100%) forFVG. Specificities were 90% (95% CI 82% to 95%) for Umbria, 91% (95% CI 83% to96%) for NA and 91% (95% CI 84% to 96%) for FVG.For carcinoma in situ thesensitivities were 100% (95% CI 93% to 100%) for Umbria, 100% (95% CI 95% to100%) for NA and 100% (95% CI 96% to 100%) for FVG. Specificities were 98% (95%CI 93% to 100%) for Umbria, 86% (95% CI 78% to 92%) for NA and 90% (95% CI 82% to95%) for FVG.CONCLUSIONS: Administrative healthcare databases from Umbria, NA and FVG areaccurate in identifying hospitalised news cases of carcinoma of the breast. Theproposed case definition is a powerful tool to perform research on largepopulations of newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.
