We propose arobust technical and statistical framework that enables transferring ofestablished real-time quantitative PCR assays across real-time quantitative PCRplatforms without compromising analytical and clinical validity. The feasibility of our approach was tested on MammaTyper, an in vitro diagnostic assay thatquantifies breast cancer biomarkers and dichotomizes results according to cutoff points. CFX96, Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast, and Mx3000P were chosen as thecandidate platforms, whereas the LightCycler 480 II was used as a reference. Two instruments were used per platform, and they were tested initially forequivalence via Bland-Altman and Deming regression analyses. A method comparison approach was adapted to adjust cutoffs for the new systems and the cross-platformagreement was evaluated. Finally, precision was estimated for each platform. The performance on the candidate devices was highly comparable to the referenceplatform, with a 7 log quantification range and amplification efficiencies of 97%to 103%. The equivalence tests successfully prequalified instruments, preventing constant and proportional errors and enabling reliable adjustments of cutoffs,which resulted in cross-platform marker and subtype agreements of 91% to 100% andκ values between 0.78 and 1.00. Provided that platform-specific adjustments areimplemented, the described process can help expand the operability ofquantitative diagnostic tests while maintaining assay performancecharacteristics.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Associationfor Molecular Pathology.
