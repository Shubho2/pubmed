A breast cancer risk score was calculated among 100,000 people. Choosing two "parents" and the allelesthey transmit at random, 100,000 "daughters" were simulated. The population wasdivided by deciles of risk score. Comparing mean risk score in the mother anddaughter populations provided information regarding the general relationship at apopulation level. By examining the distribution of daughter's risk score withineach decile of maternal risk score, the transmission was evaluated at the subjectlevel.RESULTS: Mean values of risk score were 85.1 (St Dev = 7.5) and 85.0 (StDev = 7.5) for the populations of mothers and daughters, respectively (meanabsolute difference = 0.02, p = 0.48). When examining the transmission of riskscore from mothers to daughters in specific deciles of risk, statisticallysignificant differences were observed in all deciles (ranged between 0.001and < 2.2 × 10-16).CONCLUSION: The relationship at the subject level will not provide informationregarding prevention and screening of offspring based on the knowledge ofparents' risk score alone. The present results show that risk estimation bypolygenic risk scores is personal, and evaluation of risk score is required foreach individual.Copyright © 2018.
