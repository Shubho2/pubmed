Multiple compensatory receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)pathways are known to contribute to lapatinib resistance. The heterogeneity ofthese adaptive responses is a significant hurdle for finding most effectivecombinatorial treatments. The goal of this study was to identify a unifyingmolecular mechanism whose targeting could help prevent and/or overcome lapatinib resistance. Using the MMTV-ERBB2;mutant p53 (R175H) in vivo mouse model ofERBB2-positive breast cancer, together with mouse and human cell lines, wecompared lapatinib-resistant vs. lapatinib-sensitive tumor cells biochemicallyand by kinome arrays and evaluated their viability in response to a variety ofcompounds affecting heat shock response. We found that multiple adaptive RTKs areactivated in lapatinib-resistant cells in vivo, some of which have beenpreviously described (Axl, MET) and some were novel (PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, VEGFR1,MUSK, NFGR). Strikingly, all lapatinib-resistant cells show chronically activatedHSF1 and its transcriptional targets, heat shock proteins (HSPs), and, as aresult, superior tolerance to proteotoxic stress. Importantly,lapatinib-resistant tumors and cells retained sensitivity to Hsp90 and HSF1inhibitors, both in vitro and in vivo, thus providing a unifying and actionabletherapeutic node. Indeed, HSF1 inhibition simultaneously downregulated ERBB2,adaptive RTKs and mutant p53, and its combination with lapatinib preventeddevelopment of lapatinib resistance in vitro. Thus, the kinome adaptation inlapatinib-resistant ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells is governed, at least inpart, by HSF1-mediated heat shock pathway, providing a novel potentialintervention strategy to combat resistance.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0691-x PMCID: PMC5967334PMID: 29799521
