In-depth knowledge of breast cancer such as early symptoms and riskfactors was poorly found among them. Television broadcast and relatives orfriends with breast cancers were the main sources of information about breastcancer. Of all participants, 72.8% (2167/2978) had heard about breast cancer as afrequent cancer affecting women, and 63.3% (1884/2978) knew that family historyof breast cancer was a risk factor for breast cancer. Over half of them wereaware that a breast lump could be a symptom of breast cancer. Multivariateanalysis identified the following variables that predicted awareness of breastcancer: young age (OR=0.843, 95% CI 0.740 to 0.961), occupation (agriculturalworker) (OR=12.831, 95% CI 6.998 to 23.523), high household social status(OR=0.644, 95% CI 0.531 to 0.780), breast hyperplasia history (OR=1.684, 95% CI1.273 to 2.228), high behavioural prevention score (OR=4.407, 95% CI 3.433 to5.657).CONCLUSION: Most women were aware of breast cancer as a disease, but theirin-depth knowledge of it was poor. More publicity and education programmes toincrease breast cancer awareness are necessary and urgent, especially for theageing women and agricultural workers.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
