The primary PK end point was AUC0-∞. Equivalence was determinedby using the predefined margins of 0.8 to 1.25. Other PK parameters were includedas secondary end points.FINDINGS: Baseline demographic characteristics for the 73 randomized subjectswere similar across the 2 groups: median age 29 and 30 years old (ranges 19 -45), median weight 78.6 and 81.7 kg (ranges 60.2 - 101). The 90% CIs for thegeometric least squares mean of the AUC0-∞ were included within the margins of0.8 to 1.25. All other PK parameters were comparable for both HD201 andEU-trastuzumab. The proportions of subjects who experienced adverse eventsrelated to the study drug were 61.8% and 82.9% in the HD201 and EU-trastuzumabgroups, respectively. The most frequently reported adverse events related to the study drug were infusion-related reactions. No subjects had positive results for antidrug antibodies after a single dose.IMPLICATIONS: This study reported the PK equivalence between HD201 andEU-trastuzumab. HD201 was well tolerated with no safety concerns aftersingle-dose administration in healthy male subjects. EudraCT No.: 2012-000805-56.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.
