MicroRNA-27b is an example of anoncogenic miRNA, and it is frequently upregulated in breast cancer. MicroRNAshave been found to deregulate tumor metabolism, which typically manifests asheightened cellular glucose uptake in consort with increased flux throughglycolysis, followed by the preferential conversion of glycolytic pyruvate intolactate (a phenomenon known as the Warburg Effect). Pyruvate Dehydrogenase, anenzyme complex linking glycolysis with downstream oxidative metabolism,represents a key location where regulation of metabolism occurs; PDHX is a keystructural component of this complex and is essential for its function.METHODS: We sought to characterize the role of miR-27b in breast cancer byidentifying novel transcripts under its control. We began by utilizingluciferase, RNA, and protein assays to establish PDHX as a novel target ofmiR-27b. We then tested whether miR-27b could alter metabolism using severalmetabolite assay kits and performed a seahorse analysis. We also examined how thealtered metabolism might affect cell proliferation. Lastly, we confirmed therelevance of our findings in human breast tumor samples.RESULTS: Our data indicate that Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Protein X is a credibletarget of miR-27b in breast cancer. Mechanistically, by suppressing PDHX, miR-27baltered levels of pyruvate, lactate and citrate, as well as reducingmitochondrial oxidation and promoting extracellular acidification. These changes corresponded with an increased capacity for cell proliferation. In human breasttumor samples, PDHX expression was deficient, and low levels of PDHX wereassociated with reduced patient survival.CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNA-27b targets PDHX, resulting in an altered metabolicconfiguration that is better suited to fuel biosynthetic processes and cellproliferation, thereby promoting breast cancer progression.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0851-8 PMCID: PMC6048708PMID: 30012170
