We set out to measure the uptake of tamoxifen, and the alternativeraloxifene, in national prescribing data sets.METHODS: Tamoxifen and raloxifene data were extracted from England's monthlyprescribing data sets, October 2010-October 2017. We used interrupted time seriesanalysis to reveal national and local responses to guidelines. We investigatedvariation between practices by calculating percentiles for prescribing rates and ratios of change.RESULTS: We found an increase in monthly tamoxifen prescribing following release of the guidelines, with an increase in gradient (p = 0.001) but no step change(p = 0.342). Alongside a small change in raloxifene prescribing we estimate 8450 women took up chemoprevention between 2013 and 2016. We did not find evidencethat this was limited to a small group of practices.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the uptake of new guidance onchemoprevention has been slow and has potentially left women exposed to avoidablerisk. Improving dissemination of guidance to healthcare professionals androutinely monitoring implementation could help reduce this risk.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0065-2 PMID: 29681615
