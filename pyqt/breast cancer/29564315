Basal characteristics and in vitro fertilization (IVF)outcomes were compared according to the age of women (age <35 vs. age ≥35) andthe starting phase of ovarian stimulation (early follicular phase vs. latefollicular phase vs. luteal phase).Results: Patients who were administered with a letrozole-combined regimen, thepeak serum estradiol (E2) was maintained at a low level (386.3±346.9 pg/mL). EOR was 52.4±78.8 pg/mL, and EMOR was 71.0±41.2 pg/mL. When the 2 groups werecompared according to the age of women (age <35 vs. age ≥35), EOR was 34.5(22.2-46.5) pg/mL and 40.7 (19.3-65.3) pg/mL, respectively; EMOR was 79.8(40.8-90.6) pg/mL and 68.8 (44.5-85.9) pg/mL, respectively. There was nosignificant difference in the IVF outcomes. When the 2 groups were comparedaccording to the starting phase of ovarian stimulation, there were no significantdifferences in IVF outcomes, EOR and EMOR among the groups.Conclusion: Measuring the peak E2 concentration in breast cancer patientsundergoing IVF for fertility preservation with a co-treatment of letrozole allowsfor the prediction of the numbers of oocytes and mature oocytes.DOI: 10.5468/ogs.2018.61.2.242 PMCID: PMC5854904PMID: 29564315
