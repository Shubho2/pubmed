MBC istypically very aggressive with a poor prognosis. In men, it has only beenreported three times in the literature. We report a 47-year-old man who presentedwith right-sided breast erythema and nipple inversion. Mammogram revealed a2.4 cm spiculated mass. Initial pathology was inconclusive; however, right-sided simple mastectomy showed invasive metaplastic carcinoma with adenosquamoushistology. He received adjuvant chemotherapy with 4 cycles of dose denseAdriamycin and cyclophosphamide followed by 12 weeks of paclitaxel and chest wallradiation. Although oestrogen receptor status was 1%, tamoxifen was not given dueto recent diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Two years after treatment, he iscurrently living with no signs of recurrence. This case will serve as a usefuladdition to the current literature discussing successful diagnosis, treatment andprognosis of a man with MBC.© BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article)2018.
