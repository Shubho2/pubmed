Epub2018 Feb 13.MI130004, a Novel Antibody-Drug Conjugate Combining Trastuzumab with a Moleculeof Marine Origin, Shows Outstanding In Vivo Activity against HER2-ExpressingTumors.Avilés P(#)(1), Domínguez JM(#)(2), Guillén MJ(1), Muñoz-Alonso MJ(1), MateoC(1), Rodriguez-Acebes R(1), Molina-Guijarro JM(1), Francesch A(1), Martínez-LealJF(1), Munt S(1), Galmarini CM(1), Cuevas C(1).Author information: (1)Research Department, PharmaMar S.A., Colmenar Viejo, Madrid, Spain.(2)Research Department, PharmaMar S.A., Colmenar Viejo, Madrid, Spain.jmdominguez@pharmamar.com.(#)Contributed equallyIn the search for novel payloads to design new antibody-drug conjugates (ADC),marine compounds represent an interesting opportunity given their unique chemicalfeatures. PM050489 is a marine compound that binds β-tubulin at a new site anddisrupts the microtubule network, hence leading to mitotic aberrations and celldeath. PM050489 has been conjugated to trastuzumab via Cys residues through anoncleavable linker, and the resulting ADC, named MI130004, has been studied.Analysis of MI130004 delivered data consistent with the presence of two moleculesof PM050489 per antibody molecule, likely bound to both sides of theintermolecular disulfide bond connecting the antibody light and heavy chains. Theantitumor activity of MI130004 was analyzed in vitro and in vivo in differentcell lines of diverse tumor origin (breast, ovary, and gastric cancer) expressingdifferent levels of HER2. MI130004 showed very high in vitro potency and goodselectivity for tumor cells that overexpressed HER2. At the cellular level,MI130004 impaired tubulin polymerization, causing disorganization anddisintegration of the microtubule network, which ultimately led to mitoticfailure, mirroring the effect of its payload. Treatment with MI130004 in micecarrying histologically diverse tumors expressing HER2 induced a long-lastingantitumor effect with statistically significant inhibition of tumor growthcoupled with increases in median survival time compared with vehicle ortrastuzumab. These results strongly suggest that MI130004 is endowed withremarkable anticancer activity and confirm the extraordinary potential of marine compounds for the design of new ADCs.
