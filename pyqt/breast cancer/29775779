Electronic address:angelo.dileo@uslcentro.toscana.it.Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease which has been characterised andstratified by many platforms such as clinicopathological risk factors, genomicassays, computer generated models, and various "-omic" technologies. Genomic,proteomic and transcriptomic analysis in breast cancer research is wellestablished, and metabolomics, which can be considered a downstream manifestationof the former disciplines, is of growing interest. The past decade has seensignificant progress made within the field of clinical metabolomic BC research,with several groups demonstrating results with significant promise in the settingof BC screening and biological characterisation, as well as future potential for prognostic metabolomic biomarkers.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
