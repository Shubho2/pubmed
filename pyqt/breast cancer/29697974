However, conventional PKA assays based on colorimetric, radioactive, and fluorometric techniques suffer from intensive labeling-related preparations, background interference, photobleaching, and safety concerns. Whilesurface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-based assays have been developed forvarious enzymes to address these limitations, their use in probing PKA activityis limited due to subtle changes in the Raman spectrum with phosphorylation.Here, we developed a robust colloidal SERS-based scheme for label-freequantitative measurement of PKA activity using gold nanostars (AuNS) as a SERSsubstrate functionalized with bovine serum albumin (BSA)-kemptide (Kem)bioconjugate (AuNS-BSA-Kem), where BSA conferred colloidal stability and Kem is ahigh-affinity peptide substrate for PKA. By performing principle componentanalysis (PCA) on the SERS spectrum, we identified two Raman peaks at 725 and1395 cm-1, whose ratiometric intensity change provided a quantitative measure of Kem phosphorylation by PKA in vitro and allowed us to distinguish MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells known to overexpress extracellular PKA catalyticsubunits from noncancerous human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) basedon their PKA activity in cell culture supernatant. The outcome demonstratedpotential application of AuNS-BSA-Kem as a SERS probe for cancer screening based on PKA activity.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b05417 PMID: 29697974
