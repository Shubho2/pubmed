Measurement data included demographics andFACT-G results. Descriptive analysis of demographics and trends in referralrecommendations and FACT-G scores was completed.RESULTS: All 30 participants were females diagnosed with breast cancer of variousstages, ages 28 to 81 years. Approximately 1.5 years elapsed between cancerdiagnosis and completion of the FACT-G. Participants received surgery (100%),radiation (76%), and chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy (43%). Resultsdemonstrated that participants reported having a lack of energy (24%) and werebothered by side effects of their treatment (20%). The greatest impact onfunctional well-being was difficulty sleeping (50%).LIMITATIONS: Decreased ability to generalize the data to breast cancer survivors due to small sample size from one institution and potential referral bias.CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors experience QOL issues throughout the continuum oftheir care, which can result in long-term effects on their physical, functional, social and emotional well-being. QOL is a major focus for cancer survivors andmany times determines a survivor's healthcare decisions. QOL measurements can be utilized at multiple points during survivorship to identify the need forreferrals and to guide interventions.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2272 PMCID: PMC5935424PMID: 29736356
