Palliative treatment aimed to alleviate pain and nausea in patients withadvanced disease is a cornerstone of oncology. In 2007, the Israeli Ministry ofHealth began providing approvals for medical cannabis for the palliation ofcancer symptoms. The aim of this study is to characterize the epidemiology ofcancer patients receiving medical cannabis treatment and describe the safety and efficacy of this therapy.METHODS: We analyzed the data routinely collected as part of the treatmentprogram of 2970 cancer patients treated with medical cannabis between 2015 and2017.RESULTS: The average age was 59.5 ± 16.3 years, 54.6% women and 26.7% of thepatients reported previous experience with cannabis. The most frequent types ofcancer were: breast (20.7%), lung (13.6%), pancreatic (8.1%) and colorectal(7.9%) with 51.2% being at stage 4. The main symptoms requiring therapy were:sleep problems (78.4%), pain (77.7%, median intensity 8/10), weakness (72.7%),nausea (64.6%) and lack of appetite (48.9%). After six months of follow up, 902patients (24.9%) died and 682 (18.8%) stopped the treatment. Of the remaining,1211 (60.6%) responded; 95.9% reported an improvement in their condition, 45patients (3.7%) reported no change and four patients (0.3%) reporteddeterioration in their medical condition.CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis as a palliative treatment for cancer patients seems to bewell tolerated, effective and safe option to help patients cope with themalignancy related symptoms.Copyright © 2018 European Federation of Internal Medicine.
