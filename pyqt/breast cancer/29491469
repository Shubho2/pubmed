We aimed to scan the genome for heritablemethylation marks associated with breast cancer susceptibility by studying 25Australian multiple-case breast cancer families. Here we report genome-wide DNAmethylation measured in 210 peripheral blood DNA samples provided by familymembers using the Infinium HumanMethylation450. We develop and apply a newstatistical method to identify heritable methylation marks based on complexsegregation analysis. We estimate carrier probabilities for the 1000 mostheritable methylation marks based on family structure, and we use Coxproportional hazards survival analysis to identify 24 methylation marks withcorresponding carrier probabilities significantly associated with breast cancer. We replicate an association with breast cancer risk for four of the 24 marksusing an independent nested case-control study. Here, we report a novel approach for identifying heritable DNA methylation marks associated with breast cancerrisk.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03058-6 PMCID: PMC5830448PMID: 29491469  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
