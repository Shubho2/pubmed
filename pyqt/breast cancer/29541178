China.Breast cancer is one of the most common metastatic tumor types. Reports havesuggested that Tunicamycin may inhibit the aggressiveness of cancer cells bypromoting their apoptosis. In the present study, the inhibitory effects ofTunicamycin were investigated and the potential molecular mechanism underlyingthe Tunicamycin-inhibited growth and aggressiveness of breast cancer cells wasexplored. In vitro assays demonstrated that Tunicamycin significantly inhibitedgrowth and arrested the cell cycle of breast cancer cells in a dose-dependentmanner, compared with control cells. Results revealed that Tunicamycin treatment suppressed the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Significantlyincreased apoptosis of breast cancer cells was observed subsequent to Tunicamycintreatment, as compared with control cells. Mechanism analysis demonstrated thatTunicamycin inhibited the protein kinase B (Akt) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)signaling pathways, whilst Akt overexpression significantly cancelled out theTunicamycin-inhibited growth and aggressiveness of breast cancer cells, ascompared with control cells. In vivo assays revealed that Tunicamycin treatmentsignificantly inhibited tumor growth and significantly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice, compared with the PBS-treated group. In conclusion, theseresults indicate that Tunicamycin may inhibit the growth and aggressiveness ofbreast cancer cells via regulation of the Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7874 PMCID: PMC5835892PMID: 29541178
