In the present work, we have characterized the role of Nup153 in acellular model of prostate cancer (PCa). The analysis of several immortalizedcell lines derived from freshly explants of prostate cancer specimens showed thatNup153 protein was higher and present in multimeric complexes with eNOS and ERβas compared to normal/hyperplastic prostate epithelial cells. This phenomenon wasenhanced in the presence of 17β-estradiol (E2, 10-7M). Further experimentsrevealed that eNOS and ERβ were present in a DNA binding complexes associatedwith Nup153 promoter as demonstrated by ChIPs. Notably, after Nup153 depletion(siNup153), a reduction of migration capacity and colony formation in primarytumor-derived and metastatic PCa cells was observed. In addition, eNOS and ERβnuclear localization was lost upon siNup 153 regardless of E2 treatment,suggesting that Nup153 is a key regulator of prostate cancer cell function and ofthe nuclear translocation of these proteins in response to hormone stimulus.Taken altogether our findings indicate that in PCa cells: i. the expression andfunction of Nup153 is modulated by estrogen signaling; ii. Nup153 contributes to cell migration and proliferation; iii. Nup153 regulates the nuclear translocationof eNOS and ERβ by forming a multimeric complex. Our findings unveil Nup153 as a novel component of the estrogen-dependent multimeric complex, thus representing apotential therapeutic candidate in prostate cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25462 PMCID: PMC6021351PMID: 29963256
