Patients receivedfulvestrant 250 mg intramuscularly every 28 days (from January 2009 to November2010) or 500 mg intramuscularly every 28 days (from December 2010 to August2016). Tumor responses were assessed every 8 weeks and at the end of treatment,as well as when disease progression was suspected.Results: A total of 84 patients were included in this study. A median of twoprevious endocrine treatments had been performed; 79% of the patients hadreceived two or more endocrine treatments. Forty-five patients (54%) had beentreated with chemotherapy for MBC before the fulvestrant treatment course.Visceral metastasis was found in 49 patients (58%). The estimated medianprogression-free survival and overall survival were 4.4 months (95% confidenceinterval [CI], 3.4 to 5.5) and 32.5 months (95% CI, 17.6 to 47.4), respectively. The disease control rate was 40.5% (95% CI, 30.5 to 51.5); partial response wasobserved in 16% of the patients and stable disease was observed in 25% of thepatients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were mild-to-moderategrade myalgia (10.5% of the patients), injection site pain (7%), and fatigue(7%). Fulvestrant was generally well tolerated.Conclusions: Fulvestrant showed encouraging clinical activity and favorablefeasibility in postmenopausal women with MBC who had been treated with multipleendocrine therapies and/or cytotoxic chemotherapies.DOI: 10.3904/kjim.2017.226 PMID: 29540055
