Among the newtargeted agents, anticancer drugs exploiting the cell-cycle machinery have shown great potential in preclinical studies. CDK4/6 inhibitors target the cyclinD/CDK/retinoblastoma signaling pathway, inducing cell-cycle arrest, reduced cell viability and tumor shrinking. As the cyclin D/CDK complex is activateddownstream of estrogen signaling, the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors withstandard endocrine therapies represents a rational approach to elicit synergicantitumor activity in hormone receptor-positive BC. The results of clinicaltrials have indeed confirmed the superiority of the combination of CDK4/6inhibitors plus endocrine therapies over endocrine therapy alone. Currentlyapproved are three compounds that exhibit similar structural characteristics aswell as biological and clinical activities. Abemaciclib is the latest CDK4/6inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in view of theresults of the MONARCH 1 and 2 trials. Further trials are ongoing as otherimportant questions await response. In this review, we focus on abemaciclib toexamine preclinical and clinical results, describing current therapeuticindications, open questions and ongoing clinical trials.DOI: 10.2147/DDDT.S137783 PMCID: PMC5818877PMID: 29497278
