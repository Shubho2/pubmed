Based on DXA-scans prior to and one year followingchemotherapy, the loss of BMD was evaluated in early stage breast cancer patientstreated from January 2012 to December 2014. A total of 492 patients receivedeither eight cycles of neoadjuvant or six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Thefinal analysis included 152 patients with two DXA-scans. The patients had asignificant loss of BMD in the hip [-0.0124 g/cm2 (95% confidence interval (CI)-0.018; -0.007) P<0.001] and in the lumbar spine [-0.029 g/cm2 (95% CI: -0.036;-0.023) P<0.001] corresponding to a change of -1, 3 and -2, 9%, respectively.Premenopausal women had a significant loss of BMD in the lumbar spine -0.045g/cm2 equivalent to -4.3%, which was significantly increased compared withpostmenopausal women (P<0.001) in the univariate analysis, whereas only a trendpersisted in the multivariate analysis (P=0.60). There was no significantdifference in BMD loss (lumbar spine P=0.176) between patients receiving adjuvantand neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In conclusion, neoadjuvant and adjuvantchemotherapy is associated with significant BMD loss in both hip and lumbarspine. Furthermore, the results of the present study indicate that premenopausal women have a pronounced BMD loss in the lumbar spine. Further studiesinvestigating osteoporosis prophylaxis in premenopausal patients are warranted.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2018.1615 PMCID: PMC5958697PMID: 29805791
