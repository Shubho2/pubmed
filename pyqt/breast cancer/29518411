AFPep was assessed for tolerability in a variety of invivo models, notably including assessment for effects on rat liver and humanhepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and xenografts.RESULTS: AFPep arrests the growth of human MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts,inhibits the estrogen-induced growth of mouse uteri, and does not affect livergrowth nor stimulate growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines whengrowing in vitro or as xenografts in vivo. AFPep is well tolerated in mice, rats,dogs, and primates.CONCLUSIONS: AFPep is effective for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancerand exhibits a therapeutic index that is substantially wider than that for drugs currently in clinical use. The data emphasize the importance of pursuingpre-clinical toxicology studies with the intent to enter clinical trials.Copyright Â© 2018.
