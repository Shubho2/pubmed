Data quality ofthe mortality variable version 2.0 is reported here.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, sensitivity ofmortality information improved from 66 percent in EHR structured data to 91percent in the composite dataset, with high date agreement compared to the NDI.For advanced melanoma, metastatic colorectal cancer, and metastatic breastcancer, sensitivity of the final variable was 85 to 88 percent. Kaplan-Meiersurvival analyses showed that improving mortality data completeness minimizedoverestimation of survival relative to NDI-based estimates.CONCLUSIONS: For EHR-derived data to yield reliable real-world evidence, it needsto be of known and sufficiently high quality. Considering the impact of mortalitydata completeness on survival endpoints, we highlight the importance of dataquality assessment and advocate benchmarking to the NDI.Â© 2018 The Authors.
