MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenesis byregulating specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and their roles inBCSCs are becoming more apparent. We try to reveal the mechanism by whichspecific miRNA plays its function in BCSCs. Herein, we show that miR-130a-3p isdown-regulated in human breast cancer tissues and exosomes from circulatingblood. Overexpression of miR-130a-3p in BCSCs inhibited cellular proliferation,migration, and invasion, and silencing of miR-130a-3p had the opposite effects.We also confirmed that RAB5B is directly down-regulated by miR-130a-3p. Knockdownof RAB5B also inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, we found that lower levels of exosome-derived miR-130a-3p are associated withlymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage. Taken together, our resultsdemonstrate that miR-130a-3p may act as a disease progression monitoringindicator and therapeutic target in breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
