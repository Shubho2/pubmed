The instruments used in this study were the MemorialSymptom Assessment Scale-Short Form, the Multidimensional Scale of PerceivedSocial Support, 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Cancer CopingQuestionnaire. The collected data were then analyzed using the SPSS 23.0 and AMOS23.0 programs.RESULTS: Symptom distress was found to have a significant indirect effect oncoping (beta=-.32, p=.002), but not a significant direct effect (beta=.06,p=.577). Additionally, based on the values obtained for the squared multiplecorrelation, symptom distress, social support, and resilience were found toexplain 46.4% of the total variance of coping.CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, it can be suggested that in orderto enhance young breast cancer survivors' ability to cope with the distress they commonly feel, intervention methods that strengthen resilience and provide socialsupport should be developed and made available to them.© 2018 Korean Society of Nursing Science.DOI: 10.4040/jkan.2018.48.2.241 PMID: 29735883
