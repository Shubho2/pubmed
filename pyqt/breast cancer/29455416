However, the contribution of IKKβ expressed by bone cells of thetumour microenvironment to breast cancer-induced osteolysis has yet to beinvestigated. Here, we studied the effects of the verified selective IKKβinhibitors IKKβIII or IKKβV on osteoclast formation and osteoblastdifferentiation in vitro and in vivo, human and mouse breast cancer cells'support for osteoclast formation and signalling in vitro and osteolysis ex vivoand in immunocompetent mice after supracalvarial injection of human MDA-MB-231conditioned medium or intra-cardiac injection of syngeneic 4T1 breast cancercells. Pre-treatment with IKKβIII or IKKβV prior to exposure to tumour-derivedfactors from human and mouse breast cancer cell lines protected against breastcancer-induced osteolysis in two independent immunocompetent mouse models ofosteolysis and the ex vivo calvarial bone organ system. Detailed functional andmechanistic studies showed that direct inhibition of IKKβ kinase activity inosteoblasts and osteoclasts was associated with significant reduction ofosteoclast formation, enhanced osteoclast apoptosis and reduced the ability ofosteoblasts to support osteoclastogenesis in vitro. When combined with previousfindings that suggest NFκB inhibition reduces breast cancer tumorigenesis andmetastasis our present findings have an important clinical implication on raisingthe possibility that IKKβ inhibitors, as bone anabolics, osteoclast inhibitors aswell as anti-metastatic agents, may have advantages over anti-osteoclasts agents in the treatment of both skeletal and non-skeletal complications associated with metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s00223-018-0406-4 PMCID: PMC6061461PMID: 29455416
