Based on previous reports demonstrating afunctional role for DNMT1 in DNA repair and our previous studies demonstrating anability of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) to resensitize tumors toprimary therapies, we hypothesized that combining a DNMTi with PARPi wouldsensitize PARPi-resistant breast and ovarian cancers to PARPi therapy,independent of BRCA status.Experimental Design: Breast and ovarian cancer celllines (BRCA-wild-type/mutant) were treated with PARPi talazoparib and DNMTiguadecitabine. Effects on cell survival, ROS accumulation, and cAMP levels wereexamined. In vivo, mice bearing either BRCA-proficient breast or ovarian cancercells were treated with talazoparib and guadecitabine, alone or in combination.Tumor progression, gene expression, and overall survival were analyzed.Results:Combination of guadecitabine and talazoparib synergized to enhance PARPiefficacy, irrespective of BRCA mutation status. Coadministration of guadecitabinewith talazoparib increased accumulation of ROS, promoted PARP activation, andfurther sensitized, in a cAMP/PKA-dependent manner, breast and ovarian cancercells to PARPi. In addition, DNMTi enhanced PARP "trapping" by talazoparib.Guadecitabine plus talazoparib decreased xenograft tumor growth and increasedoverall survival in BRCA-proficient high-grade serous ovarian and triple-negativebreast cancer models.Conclusions: The novel combination of the next-generationDNMTi guadecitabine and the first-in-class PARPi talazoparib inhibited breast andovarian cancers harboring either wild-type- or mutant-BRCA, supporting furtherclinical exploration of this drug combination in PARPi-resistant cancers.
