[Epub ahead of print]Clinicopathologic features of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer patientswith late recurrence.Murata T(1), Jinno H(2), Takahashi M(3), Shimoda M(4), Hayashida T(3), KameyamaK(5), Kitagawa Y(3).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Kitasato University Kitasato Institute Hospital, Tokyo,Japan.(2)Department of Surgery, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.(3)Department of Surgery, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.(4)Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.(5)Division of Diagnostic Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo,Japan.The number of long-term breast cancer survivors with a risk of late recurrence isincreasing. Hormone-receptor-positive patients have greater risks of laterecurrence. Although several studies demonstrated that extended adjuvantendocrine therapy reduces the incidence of late recurrence, it remains unclearwhich hormone-receptor-positive patients have greater risks of late recurrence.Hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer patients were retrospectively selectedfrom the prospective database of primary breast cancer patients treated at KeioUniversity Hospital from January 1989 to December 2003. Late recurrence wasdefined as initial recurrence after 5 years from the initial surgery. Weevaluated the clinicopathologic features of breast cancer patients with laterecurrence. At a median follow-up of 10.9 years (range, 5.1-23.8), 371 patientshad no recurrence, 90 had early recurrence (within 5 years), and 83 had laterecurrence. Multivariate analysis revealed that >4 involved lymph nodes weresignificant risk factors for late recurrence (P < .001), whereas 1-3 positivenodes were not. Endocrine therapy significantly reduced the incidence of laterecurrence (P < .001). After menopause, adjuvant therapy with aromataseinhibitors resulted in longer disease-free survival than tamoxifen (10-yeardisease-free survival: 97.6% vs 89.7%, P = .0955). High nodal involvement wassignificantly correlated with late recurrence in hormone-receptor-positive breastcancer patients. Hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer patients who receiveadjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen alone might be candidates for extended endocrine therapy.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13033 PMID: 29687661
