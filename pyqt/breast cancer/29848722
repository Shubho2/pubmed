The search for perioperative prognosticfactors could help determine high risk groups of patients. The aim of study wasto evaluate the significance of tumour markers (TM) on long-term treatmentresults.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Liver surgery was carried out in 32 women for BCLM. Theperioperative serum levels of CEA, CA19-9, TPA, TPS, CYFRA 21-1 and TK weredetermined.RESULTS: Preoperative levels of CA19-9 were significant for overall survival(OS)(p<0.05) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p<0.01). TPA, TPS and CYFRA 21-1levels were significant for OS (p<0.05; p<0.04; p<0.05). Postoperative levels of CEA, TPS and CYFRA 21-1 were significant for RFS (p<0.04; p<0.01; p<0.02), while CA19-9 postoperative levels were significant for OS and RFS (p<0.03; p<0.01).CONCLUSION: Perioperative TM serum levels may represent prognostic indicatorsreflecting the results of surgical treatment of BCLM.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12640 PMID: 29848722  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
