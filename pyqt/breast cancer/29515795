Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa,FL, USA.Background: Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase is an enzyme that causesimmunosuppression in tumors. Indoximod inhibits the indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase pathway and enhances immunologic responses to dendritic cell (DC) vaccinespreclinically. Adenovirus p53 (Ad.p53) is used to generate DC vaccines againstp53. A phase-1/2 trial of indoximod with Ad.p53-DC vaccine was conducted.Materials and Methods: The phase-1 study combined 7 indoximod dose levels with < 6 Ad.p53-DC vaccinations every 2 weeks. Primary endpoints were maximum-tolerated dose in phase 1 and objective response in phase 2. Flow cytometry measured immuneresponses.Results: Thirty-nine patients were treated. In combination with Ad.p53-DCvaccine, the maximum-tolerated dose of indoximod was 1600 mg twice daily.Attributable toxicities were grade 1-2. Best response was stable disease in 4patients. Immunologic responses were detected in 7 out of 23 evaluable patients. Median progression-free survival was 13.3 weeks (95% confidence interval,12.97-21.85) and median overall survival was 20.71 weeks (95% confidenceinterval, 25.75-46.15). Nine out of 22 patients (40%) benefitted fromchemotherapy after vaccination. Median overall survival in chemotherapyresponders was 69.4 weeks (30.1-122.1).Conclusions: Indoximod 1600 mg twice daily with Ad.p53-DC was well tolerated.There may have been a chemosensitization effect. Future trials should explorecombining this treatment with chemotherapy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24118 PMCID: PMC5839376PMID: 29515795
