We examinedtwo groups of patients who underwent direct-to-implant (DTI) reconstruction afterNSM, comparing complications encountered, revision rates, and aesthetic outcomes.The patients were stratified based on type of surgical incision and assigned toinframammary fold (IMF) and non-IMF groups.Methods: We investigated 141 patients (145 breasts) subjected to NSM andimmediate DTI reconstruction between 2013 and 2016. A total of 62 breasts (in 58 patients) were surgically removed via IMF incisions, with the other 83 breasts(in 83 patients) removed by non-IMF means.Results: Complications associated with IMF (n=62) and non-IMF (n=83) incisionswere as follows: skin necrosis (IMF, 9; non-IMF, 18); hematoma (IMF, 3; non-IMF, 4); seroma (IMF, 8; non-IMF, 4); mild capsular contracture (IMF, 4; non-IMF, 7); and tumor recurrence (IMF, 2; non-IMF, 8). Surgical revisions were counted asduplicates (IMF, 18; non-IMF, 38). Aesthetic outcomes following IMF incisionswere rated as very good (44.2%), good (23.1%), fair (23.1%), or poor (9.6%).Conclusion: IMF incision enables complete preservation of the nipple-areolarcomplex, yielding superior aesthetic results in immediate DTI breastreconstruction after NSM. The nature of incision used had no significant impacton postoperative complications or reoperation rates and had comparable oncologic safety to that of non-IMF incisions. IMF incisions produced the least visiblescarring and did not affect breast shape. Most patients were satisfied with theaesthetic outcomes.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.213 PMCID: PMC6015980PMID: 29963118
