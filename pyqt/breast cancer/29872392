Limited knowledge regarding GPCR expression in cancer cells likely has contributed to this lack of use of GPCR-targeted drugs as cancertherapeutics. We thus undertook GPCRomic studies to define the expression ofendoGPCRs (which respond to endogenous molecules such as hormones,neurotransmitters and metabolites) in multiple types of cancer cells. UsingTaqMan qPCR arrays to quantify the mRNA expression of âˆ¼340 such GPCRs, we foundthat human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells/stromal cells associated withCLL, breast cancer cell lines, colon cancer cell lines, pancreatic ductaladenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and PDACtumors express 50 to >100 GPCRs, including many orphan GPCRs (which lack knownphysiologic agonists). Limited prior data exist regarding the expression orfunction of most of the highly expressed GPCRs in these cancer cells and tumors. Independent results from public cancer gene expression databases confirm theexpression of such GPCRs. We propose that highly expressed GPCRs in cancer cells (for example, GPRC5A in PDAC and colon cancer cells and GPR68 in PDAC CAFs) maycontribute to the malignant phenotype, serve as biomarkers and/or may be noveltherapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00431 PMCID: PMC5972277PMID: 29872392
