TheAR/ER ratio has been reported to impact prognosis and response to antiestrogenendocrine therapy (ET).METHODS: We assessed whether AR in primary tumors and/or matched metastases is a predictor of efficacy of first-line ET in advanced BC. Patients who had received first-line ET (2002-2011) were recruited, while those given concomitantchemotherapy or trastuzumab or pretreated with > 2 lines of chemotherapy wereexcluded. ER, progesterone receptor (PgR), Ki67 and AR expression were assessedby immunohistochemistry, and HER2 mainly by fluorescent in-situ hybridization.Cut-offs of 1 and 10% immunostained cells were used to categorize AR expression.RESULTS: Among 102 evaluable patients, biomarkers were assessed in primary tumorsin 70 cases and in metastases in 49, with 17 patients having both determinations.The overall concordance rate between primary tumors and metastases was 64.7% (95%CI 42%-87.4%) for AR status. AR status did not affect TTP significantly, whereas PgR and Ki67 status did. AR/PgR ≥0.96 was associated with a significantly shorterTTP (HR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.05-2.61, p = 0.028). AR status in primary tumors ormetastases was not associated with progressive disease (PD) as best response. In contrast, Ki67 ≥ 20% and PgR < 10% showed a statistically significant associationwith PD as best response.CONCLUSIONS: AR expression does not appear to be useful to predict the efficacyof ET in advanced BC, whereas Ki67 and PgR exert a greater impact on itsefficacy.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4239-3 PMCID: PMC5872575PMID: 29587674
