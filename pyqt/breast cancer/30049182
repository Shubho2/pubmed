Email: ricvandana7@gmail.comObjective: The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy ofdifferent machine learning algorithms for breast cancer risk calculation.Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted of published research articles ondiagnostic test accuracy of different machine learning algorithms for breastcancer risk calculation published between January 2000 and May 2018 in the onlinearticle databases of PubMed, ProQuest and EBSCO. Paired forest plots wereemployed for the analysis. Numerical values for sensitivity and specificity were obtained from false negative (FN), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) andtrue positive (TP) rates, presented alongside graphical representations withboxes marking the values and horizontal lines showing the confidence intervals(CIs). Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were applied toassess the performance of diagnostic tests. Data were processed using ReviewManager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3). Results: A total of 1,879 articles were reviewed, ofwhich 11 were selected for systematic review and meta-analysis. Fve algorithmsfor machine learning able to predict breast cancer risk were identified: SuperVector Machine (SVM); Artificial Neural Networks (ANN); Decision Tree (DT); NaiveBayes (NB); and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). With the SVM, the Area Under Curve(AUC) from the SROC was > 90%, therefore classified into the excellent category. Conclusion: The meta-analysis confirmed that the SVM algorithm is able tocalculate breast cancer risk with better accuracy value than other machinelearning algorithms.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.7.1747 PMID: 30049182
