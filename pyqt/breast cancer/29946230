A major reason forthis is that most current techniques and model systems do not capture thecomplexity of signal transduction that occurs between CAFs and tumor cells.Methods: In this study, we employed a stable isotope labeling with amino acids incell culture (SILAC) strategy to label invasive breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231, and breast cancer patient-derived CAF this has already been defined above cells. We used an antibody-based phosphotyrosine peptide enrichment method coupled toLC-MS/MS to catalog and quantify tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated signaltransduction events induced by the bidirectional communication betweenpatient-derived CAFs and tumor cells.Results: We discovered that distinct signaling events were activated in CAFs and in tumor epithelial cells during the crosstalk between these two cell types. Weidentified reciprocal activation of a number of receptor tyrosine kinasesincluding EGFR, FGFR1 and EPHA2 induced by this bidirectional communication.Conclusions: Our study not only provides insights into the mechanisms of theinteraction between CAFs and tumor cells, but the model system described herecould be used as a prototype for analysis of intercellular communication in many different tumor microenvironments.DOI: 10.1186/s12014-018-9197-x PMCID: PMC6003199PMID: 29946230
