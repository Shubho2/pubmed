We aim to describe the real-world treatmentpatterns and overall survival (OS) for women surviving five or more years frominitiation of trastuzumab for HER2+MBC.METHODS: This is a retrospective, whole-of-population cohort study of womeninitiating trastuzumab for HER2+MBC between 2001 and 2011, followed to 2016. Wedefined long-term survivors (LTS) as those patients surviving ≥ 5 years fromtrastuzumab initiation. We used dispensing claims to describe timing of cancertreatments used by LTS and to estimate time on and off HER2-targeted therapies,and OS from trastuzumab initiation for HER2+MBC.RESULTS: Of 4177 women initiating trastuzumab for HER2+MBC, 1082 (26%) survived≥ 5 years. Median age for LTS was 54 years (IQR 46-63). At a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 36% of LTS died; their conditional probability of surviving anadditional 5 years was 55%. Median time on trastuzumab and all HER2-targetedtherapy was 58.9 months (27.6-88.1) and 69.1 months (35.6-124.5), respectively.85% of LTS had a period off HER2 therapy, lasting a median of 30.4 months(8.2-NR).CONCLUSIONS: LTS generally receive HER2-targeted therapies for periods of timelonger than in clinical trials, but most LTS also had breaks in treatment. Moreresearch is needed to understand the effects of long-term treatment and toidentify patients who may be able to safely discontinue HER2-targeted therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4804-0 PMID: 29736743
