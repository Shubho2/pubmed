A computer-aideddetection (CAD) framework for mass detection in DBT has been developed and isdescribed in this paper. The proposed framework operates on a set oftwo-dimensional (2D) slices. With plane-to-plane analysis on corresponding 2Dslices from each DBT, it automatically learns complex patterns of 2D slicesthrough a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). It then applies multipleinstance learning (MIL) with a randomized trees approach to classify DBT imagesbased on extracted information from 2D slices. This CAD framework was developedand evaluated using 5040 2D image slices derived from 87 DBT volumes. Theempirical results demonstrate that this proposed CAD framework achieves muchbetter performance than CAD systems that use hand-crafted features and deepcardinality-restricted Bolzmann machines to detect masses in DBTs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
