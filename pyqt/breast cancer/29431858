The level of local or globalasymmetry is assessed by analyzing mammographic features extracted from thebilaterally matched regions of interest (ROIs), or from the entire breast,respectively. The selected local and global feature vectors are combined andclassified using a maximum likelihood obtained from a naïve Bayes classifier.This scheme was evaluated using a leave-one-case-out cross-validation method thatwas applied to 243 subjects from mini-MIAS and INbreast databases. In addition,the result is compared with a conventional unilateral (or single) image-based CADscheme.RESULTS: Using a case-based evaluation approach and an area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) as a performance index, the newscheme yielded AUC = 0.79 ± 0.07, an 8.2% increase compared withAUC = 0.73 ± 0.08 obtained using the unilateral image-based CAD scheme.CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that applying bilateral asymmetry analysisincreases the discriminatory power of CAD schemes while optimizing the likelihoodassessment of breast abnormalities presence. Therefore, the proposed CAD approachprovides the radiologist with beneficial supplementary information and canindicate high-risk cases.© 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/mp.12806 PMID: 29431858
