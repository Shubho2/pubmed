This studyaimed to describe the extent and range of oral and dental complications in BMTrecipients and to identify gaps in service provision provided to this high-riskgroup.METHODS: Participants were Allo-BMT recipients, aged >18 years, and receivedtransplants between 2000 and 2012 in NSW. They completed seven surveys, thepurpose-designed Sydney Post-BMT Study survey and six other validatedinstruments.RESULTS: Of 441 respondents, many reported dry mouth (45.1%), dental caries(36.7%), mouth ulcers (35.3%), oral GVHD (35.1%), gingivitis (16.2%), toothabscess (6.1%) and oral cancer (1.5%). Regular dental visits were reported by66.2% of survivors. Middle-high income, older age and geographic location showed a positive association with regular dental visits. Of those who did not visit thedentist regularly, 37% stated they did not feel it necessary, 36% reported costand 20% stated it was not advised by the treating team.CONCLUSION: Despite oral complications commonly occurring after Allo-BMT, manysurvivors receive inadequate dental care. These results emphasize the need forimproved oral health education, the importance of regular dental checks andimprovement in the delivery of dental health services for BMT survivors.© 2018 Australian Dental Association.DOI: 10.1111/adj.12627 PMID: 29878377
