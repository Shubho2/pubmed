The following data were collected: age, gender, smoking status, tumor staging, type of lung cancer, and time from the date when thepatient was diagnosed with cancer to the starting date of effective treatment.Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used toinvestigate the association between potential confounders identified during thestudy design. After the final adjusted model was determined, tests forinteraction among all predictors were performed.Results: Inclusion criteria were met by 359 patients. In the adjusted analysis,delayed treatment delivery was a protective factor for the risk of death, with a crude hazard ratio (HR) =0.75 (0.59-0.97; P=0.02) and an adjusted HR =0.59(0.46-0.77; P<0.001). However, a statistically significant interaction withmortality was observed between timely treatment and tumor stage. Patients withstage II disease who received delayed treatment had a higher risk of death [HR=3.08 (1.05-9.0; P=0.04)]. On the other hand, stage IV patients who receiveddelayed treatment had a 52% reduction in mortality [HR =0.48 (0.35-0.66;P<0.001)].Conclusions: Stage of disease influenced the association between start of thetreatment and mortality, and only the subgroup of stage II patients seemed tobenefit from early treatment.DOI: 10.21037/jtd.2018.05.22 PMCID: PMC6006055PMID: 29997944
