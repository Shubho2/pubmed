Electronic address: gux2002@suda.edu.cn.A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 12 (ADAM12) is highly expressed in multiplecancers such as breast and cervical cancers and its high expression reduces theoverall patient survival rate. ADAM12 has two major splicing variants, the longmembrane-anchored form ADAM12L and the short secreted form ADAM12S. However, how they are regulated and whether they are modulated similarly or differently incells are not clear. Here, we use affinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify the ADAM12S-interacting proteins. Spectral counting and MaxQuantlabel-free quantification reveal that ADAM12S but not ADAM12L specificallyinteracts with a subset of endoplasmic reticulum proteins, such as endoplasmin(GRP94), 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), and UDP-glucose:glycoproteinglucosyltransferase I (UGGT1), that regulate the folding and processing ofsecreted proteins. Further biochemical experiments validate the interactionbetween ADAM12S and several of its interacting proteins. Computational dockinganalysis demonstrates that GRP94 preferentially interacts with ADAM12S overADAM12L. The data also suggest that both the protein expression level and thesecretion of ADAM12S are regulated by GRP94 expression and knockdown. Our resultsreveal a link between these two proteins that are highly expressed in cancercells. Furthermore, our studies define a new ADAM12S-specific regulator that may contribute to the cancer development.SIGNIFICANCE: A Disintegrin AndMetalloproteinase 12 (ADAM12) is highly expressed in many cancers such as lung,breast, and cervical cancers. ADAM12 has two major splicing variants, the longmembrane-anchored form ADAM12L and the short secreted form ADAM12S. However, how they are regulated and whether they are modulated similarly or differently arenot completely understood. We use affinity purification and label-freequantitative proteomics to identify the ADAM12S-interacting proteins. Our resultsreveal that ADAM12S specifically interacts with a subset of endoplasmic reticulumproteins, including endoplasmin (GRP94), UDP-glucose:glycoproteinglucosyltransferase I (UGGT1), and neutral α-glucosidase AB (GANAB). Computermodeling reveals that ADAM12S interacts with the surface amino acids of GRP94more strongly than ADAM12L. Biochemical experiments further reveal that GRP94regulates both the protein level and the secretion of ADAM12S. Database miningfinds that both GRP94 and ADAM12 are highly expressed in multiple cancers andtheir high expression is correlated with poor patient survival rate. Takentogether, our work discovers a new upstream regulator for ADAM12S, which maycontribute to its distinct functions in the regulation of the migration andinvasion of cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
