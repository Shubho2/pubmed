Hinging on recent researchthat training attentional control can reduce emotional vulnerability, we assesshow improving cognitive function could reduce emotional vulnerability in femalesurvivors of breast cancer.METHODS: Participants took part in a course of adaptive dual n-back cognitivetraining (Training Group) or a non-adaptive active control group (Active Control)for 12 days across a 2-week period. Transfer-related training gains were assessedimmediately after the intervention, at a shorter 1-month follow-up and at alonger follow-up time of approximately 15 months post intervention, to assesssustainability of training effects.RESULTS: Adaptive cognitive training reduced anxiety and rumination with effects evident at shorter and longer term follow-up assessments.CONCLUSIONS: Our results are among the first to suggest that adaptive cognitivetraining can reduce emotional vulnerability in breast cancer, with the potential to enhance quality of life in survivorship. Our findings have profoundimplications for designing interventions targeting cognitive function inpopulations who have suffered from cancer.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4727 PMID: 29631328
