Type of axillary surgery was analyzed using the FORDSscope of regional lymph node surgery variable. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to identify independent predictors associated with SNB aloneand the use of PMRT.RESULTS: Of 8089 patients, 2482 (30.7%) underwent SNB alone, 1339 (16.6%)underwent axillary dissection (ALND) alone, and 4268 (52.7%) underwent SNBfollowed by ALND. Fifty-seven percent of patients with micrometastases underwent SNB alone compared with 22.6% of patients with macrometastases. Independentpredictors of SNB alone for patients with micrometastases were African Americanrace, number of nodes positive, and PMRT. For patients with macrometastases, age,facility type and location, and PMRT were independent predictors for SNB alone.Of 2449 patients who underwent SNB alone, 1538 (62.8%) had no PMRT, 261 (10.7%)had PMRT alone, and 650 (26.5%) had PMRT with regional nodal irradiation.Patients undergoing SNB alone were 1.70 times [96% confidence interval (CI)1.45-2.00] more likely to undergo PMRT than upfront ALND and 1.51 times (96% CI1.34-1.71) more likely than SNB followed by ALND.CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons are omitting completion ALND in a third of early-stage,node-positive mastectomy patients. SNB alone patients are more likely to undergo PMRT than patients undergoing ALND.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6409-6 PMID: 29626303
