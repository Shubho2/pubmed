In recent years, studies have demonstrated different phenotypesamong BCSCs. Furthermore, BCSCs of diverse phenotypes are present at differenttumour sites and different histological stages. Fibroblasts are involved in thephenotypic transformation of BCSCs. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)participate in the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, therebypromoting the acquisition of stem cell characteristics, but little is known aboutthe role of normal fibroblasts (NFs) in the phenotypic transformation of BCSCs orabout the effect of CAFs and NFs on BCSC phenotypes.Methods: A total of six pairs of primary CAFs and NFs were isolated from surgicalsamples of breast cancer patients and subjected to morphological,immunohistochemical, cell invasion and proteomics analyses. After establishing a cell culture system with conditioned medium from CAFs and NFs, we used themammosphere formation assay to explore the effect of CAFs and NFs on theself-renewal ability of BCSCs. The effect of CAFs and NFs on the phenotypicdifferentiation of BCSCs was further analysed by flow cytometry andimmunofluorescence.Results: The isolated CAFs and NFs did not show significant differences in cellmorphology or alpha-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) expression, but cell invasion andproteomics analyses demonstrated heterogeneity among these fibroblasts. Both CAFsand NFs could promote the generation of BCSCs, but CAFs displayed a greaterability than NFs in promoting mammosphere formation. Conditioned medium from CAFsincreased the proportion of aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 positive (ALDH1+) BCSCs, butconditioned medium from NFs was more likely to promote the generation ofCD44+CD24- BCSCs from MCF-7 cells.Discussion: This study validated the heterogeneity among CAFs and NFs andexpanded on the conclusion that fibroblasts promote the generation of cancer stemcells. Our results particularly emphasized the effect of NFs on the phenotypictransformation of BCSCs. In addition, this study further highlighted the roles ofCAFs and NFs in the induction of different phenotypes in BCSCs.DOI: 10.7717/peerj.4805 PMCID: PMC5958881PMID: 29780673
