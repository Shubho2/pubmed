Electronic address:apaulovi@fredhutch.org.The Fanconi anemia pathway is an important coordinator of DNA repair pathways andis particularly relevant to repair of DNA inter-strand crosslinks. Central to thepathway is monoubiquitination of FANCD2, requiring the function of multipleproteins in an upstream Fanconi core complex. We present development andanalytical characterization of a novel assay for quantification of unmodified andmonoubiquitinated FANCD2 proteoforms, based on peptide immunoaffinity enrichment and targeted multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (immuno-MRM). Theimmuno-MRM assay is analytically characterized using fit-for-purpose methodvalidation. The assay linear range is >3 orders of magnitude with totalrepeatability <16% CV. In proof-of-principle experiments, we demonstrateapplication of the multiplex assay by quantifying the FANCD2 proteoformsfollowing mitomycin-c treatment in an isogenic pair of FancA-corrected anduncorrected cell lines, as well as primary peripheral blood mononuclear cellsfrom Fanconi Anemia patients. Additionally, we demonstrate detection ofendogenous FANCD2 monoubiquitination in human breast cancer tissue. Theimmuno-MRM assay provides a potential functional diagnostic for patients withFanconi Anemia with defects in the upstream FA complex or FANCD2, and a potentialtest for predicting sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents in human cancers.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
