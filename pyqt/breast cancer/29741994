However choosing an appropriate isolationmethod is an important step in obtaining cells with optimal quality and yield in companion with economical considerations. The purpose of this study was toisolate more pure MSCs from human breast tumor tissue by a modified explantculture method.METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor tissues (n = 8) were cut into 1 to 3-mmcube-like pieces (explant). Each explant was placed in a well of 24-well formatplates, cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and maintained at 37°C with 5% humidified incubator. Morphological phenotypes of the cells weresurveyed by an inverted microscope and wells with rather homogenousfibroblast-like morphology cell were considered as positive and selected for moreexpansion and characterization.RESULTS: A total of 185 wells, 63.7% of wells were positive that were chosen for expansion. Flowcytometry analysis demonstrated that isolated cells were positive for CD73, CD44, CD29, CD105, and CD90 but negative for CD11b, CD45, CD34, andHLA‑DR. In addition, cells possessed the capability of multipotentialdifferentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes.DOI: 10.1080/15321819.2018.1447487 PMID: 29741994  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
