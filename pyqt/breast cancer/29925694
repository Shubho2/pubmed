However, attempts at targeting the shedMUC1 N-terminal subunit have been unsuccessful. We report here the generation of mAb 3D1 against the nonshed oncogenic MUC1 C-terminal (MUC1-C) subunit. We showthat mAb 3D1 binds with low nM affinity to the MUC1-C extracellular domain at therestricted Î±3 helix. mAb 3D1 reactivity is selective for MUC1-C-expressing human cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells. Internalization of mAb 3D1 intocancer cells further supported the conjugation of mAb 3D1 to monomethylauristatin E (MMAE). The mAb 3D1-MMAE antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) (a) killsMUC1-C-positive cells in vitro, (b) is nontoxic in MUC1-transgenic (MUC1.Tg)mice, and (c) is active against human HCC827 lung tumor xenografts. Humanized mAb(humAb) 3D1 conjugated to MMAE also exhibited antitumor activity in (a) MUC1.Tgmice harboring syngeneic MC-38/MUC1 tumors, (b) nude mice bearing human ZR-75-1breast tumors, and (c) NCG mice engrafted with a patient-derived triple-negative breast cancer. These findings and the absence of associated toxicities supportclinical development of humAb 3D1-MMAE ADCs as a therapeutic for the many cancerswith MUC1-C overexpression.DOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.99880 PMID: 29925694
