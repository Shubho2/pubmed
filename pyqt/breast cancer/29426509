Electronic address:hfyang@shnu.edu.cn.Particles which bear tumor cell targeting and multimode imaging capabilities are promising in tumor diagnosis and cancer therapy. A simple and versatile method tofabricate gold/polydopamine-Methylene Blue@Bovine SerumAlbumin-glutaraldehyde-Transferrin composite particles (Au/PDA-MB@BSA-GA-Tf NPs) for tumor cell targeting and fluorescence (FL) / surface-enhanced Ramanscattering (SERS) dual-modal imaging were reported in this work. Polydopamine(PDA) spheres played an important role in gold ion reduction, gold nanoparticle(Au NPs) binding and methylene blue (MB) adsorption, MB were employed as bothfluorescence label and Raman reporter. In addition, glutaraldehyde (GA)crosslinked bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the outer layer of Au/PDA-MBnanoparticles can prevent MB from dissociation and leakage. The compositenanoparticles were further conjugated with transferrin (Tf) to target transferrinreceptor (TfR)-overexpressed cancer cells. The targeting ability as well as theintracellular location of the probe was investigated through SERS mapping andfluorescence imaging. Their excellent biocompatibility was demonstrated by lowcytotoxicity against breast cancer cell (4T1 cell).Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
