However, their impact on the breast tissue phenotypehas been poorly studied. Here, we investigate the association of imaging data of tumors to gene expression signatures from 71 patients with breast cancer thatunderwent pre-treatment digital mammograms and tumor biopsies. From digitalmammograms, a semi-automated radiogenomics analysis generated 1,078 featuresdescribing the shape, signal distribution, and texture of tumors along theircontralateral image used as control. From tumor biopsy, we estimated theOncotypeDX and PAM50 recurrence scores using gene expression microarrays. Then,we used multivariate analysis under stringent cross-validation to train modelspredicting recurrence scores. Few univariate features reached Spearmancorrelation coefficients above 0.4. Nevertheless, multivariate analysis yieldedsignificantly correlated models for both signatures (correlation of OncotypeDX = 0.49 ± 0.07 and PAM50 = 0.32 ± 0.10 in stringent cross-validation and OncotypeDX = 0.83 and PAM50 = 0.78 for a unique model). Equivalent models trained from theunaffected contralateral breast were not correlated suggesting that the imagesignatures were tumor-specific and that overfitting was not a considerable issue.We also noted that models were improved by combining clinical information (triplenegative status and progesterone receptor). The models used mostly wavelets andfractal features suggesting their importance to capture tumor information. Ourresults suggest that molecular-based recurrence risk and breast cancer subtypeshave observable radiographic phenotypes. To our knowledge, this is the firststudy associating mammographic information to gene expression recurrencesignatures.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193871 PMCID: PMC5875760PMID: 29596496  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
