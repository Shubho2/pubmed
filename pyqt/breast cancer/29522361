We sought to describe thedifferential outcomes of patients with BO MBC in clinical trials and explorewhether there was a discrepancy in radiographic reads between investigator andblinded independent central review. Methods We pooled and analyzed data on 10,521patients from 13 prospective trials submitted for MBC treatment in initial orsupplemental New Drug or Biologics License Applications from 2005. Three subsets were evaluated: BO, bone with other metastases (BWO), and no bone metastases(NBM). Early discordance rate and late discordance rate were calculated from3,733 and 2,813 patients subject to a blinded independent central review,respectively. Results Bone metastases were identified in 49% (range: 42% to 73%) of patients across trials. BO disease was present in 12.5% (range: 4% to 26%),dependent on subtype. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) andoverall survival (OS) for the pooled trials demonstrated improved outcomes forthe BO subgroup compared with other subgroups (BO v BWO PFS hazard ratio [HR],0.64; 95% CI, 0.591 to 0.696; BO v NBM PFS HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.76; BO vBWO OS HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.61; BO v NBM OS HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.61 to0.76). The BO subgroup has a higher early discordance rate and lower latediscordance rate than the BWO and NBM subgroups. Conclusion To our knowledge,this review is the largest analysis to date of the BO subgroup of MBC andsuggests this subgroup may have a distinct natural history. There also seems tobe a difference in how the local investigators assessed progression events in theBO subgroup when compared with the other two groups.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.74.6917 PMCID: PMC5908220 [Available on 2019-04-20]PMID: 29522361
