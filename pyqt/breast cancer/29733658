However, the slow blood clearance of BV, which may increase the occurrence risk of hematotoxicity, hinders the applicationof BV-RIT. Using the avidin chase is a long-known blood clearance enhancementstrategy for biotinylated-mAb. To enhance RIT efficacy by increasing theradioactivity dose, we evaluated the ability of avidin to accelerate the bloodclearance of yttrium-90 (90Y)-labeled biotinylated BV (90Y-Bt-BV) in a xenograft mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The biodistribution study inthe TNBC xenograft mice confirmed the high and specific tumor accumulation of theindium-111 (111In)-BV. The blood clearance enhancement effect of the avidin chasewas demonstrated in the normal mouse studies with 111In-Bt-BV. In the subsequent biodistribution studies with the tumor-bearing mice, an optimized dose of avidin injection subsequent to 111In-Bt-BV with an appropriate biotin valencysuccessfully accelerated the blood clearance of 111In-Bt-BV without impairing itstumor accumulation level. The avidin chase enabled an increase in the maximumtolerated dose of 90Y-Bt-BV to twice as much as that of 90Y-BV in tumor-bearingmice and thereby significantly improved the therapeutic effect of 90Y-Bt-BVcompared to 90Y-BV ( p < 0.05). These results underscored the potentialusefulness of 90Y-bevacizumab-RIT with the avidin chase for the treatment ofVEGF-positive tumors.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00027 PMID: 29733658
