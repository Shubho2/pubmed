We present therectangle-to-cube nipple flap, a new technique for challenging nipplereconstruction. A review of published techniques is compared and contrasted with this flap design. Methods: Following bilateral total skin-sparing mastectomies, apatient with breast cancer underwent breast reconstruction with tissue expanders and subsequent nipple reconstruction with the rectangle-to-cube nipple flap. Aninferiorly based rectangular flap with medial and lateral extensions is designed inferior to the transverse scar. Upon elevation and rotation, the medial andlateral flaps form a cube. Results: In all cases of rectangle-to-cube nippleflaps performed at our institution, adequate nipple projection and patientsatisfaction have been achieved at 2-month postoperative evaluation. Conclusion: The rectangle-to-cube nipple flap provides sustained nipple projection due to thede-epithelialized base on which the flap sits. The rectangle-to-cube nipple flap also takes advantage of a long transverse scar, and it can be extended to includelonger scars for scar revisions.PMCID: PMC5865227PMID: 29623151
