From Egyptian papyri to Hippocratic theory, from Galen'sdissections to Halsted's radical mastectomy, and from sentinel lymph node mappingto the development of nipple-sparing mastectomies, this review starts at thebeginning and highlights breakthroughs and innovation in technique and medicinethat have fundamentally changed the way breast cancer is managed. The progressiondepicted in this review acts as a proxy to the management of other complexdiseases. Breast cancer was initially managed with operative extirpation alone,but now requires a multidisciplinary team across various surgical, medical,psychological, and social specialties in order to produce the best outcomes forour patients.DOI: 10.21037/gs.2017.09.07 PMCID: PMC6006018PMID: 29998080
