European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23) are now the most common and well developedinstruments assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of breast cancerpatients internationally, whereas there are relatively few Chinese studies. This study has two aims: to investigate the HRQOL and explore which dimensions ofHRQOL play more important roles in breast cancer patients' overall quality oflife in China and to explore the latent factor structure and the potentialcomplementary relationship between these two EORTC questionnaires.Methods: This cross-sectional and descriptive study was performed from October2014 to February 2015 in Qingdao Municipal Hospital, China. A total of 621 women breast cancer patients were enrolled. EOTRC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 were used toevaluate the HRQOL of the participants. The nonparametric test, multiple linearregression, and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were the main statisticalmethods we used.Results: 608 participants completed the questionnaires with a response rate of97.9%. The mean age of the participants was 48.0 years (SD=9.6). About 33% wereilliterate or only finished primary school education. Almost half participants(47.4%) only adopted chemotherapy. HRQOL was significantly different with regard to patients' social-demographic and clinical characteristics. Age, residence,educational level, employment status, and TNM stage were five significantpredictors for global health status. Pain, dyspnea, sexual enjoyment, andsystemic therapy side-effect were main subscales which had a significant impacton the global health status for patients in different TNM stage. The EFA resultsuggested that QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 were complementary questionnaires.Conclusions: The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires provide complementary information regarding breast cancer patients' HRQOL, and depending on thedifferent cancer staging functional/symptom scales which significantlycontributed to the overall HRQOL differed.DOI: 10.1155/2018/1452635 PMCID: PMC6051298PMID: 30065931
