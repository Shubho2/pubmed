[Epub ahead of print]Differences in Balance Function Between Cancer Survivors and Healthy Subjects: A Pilot Study.Morishita S(1), Mitobe Y(1), Tsubaki A(1), Aoki O(2), Fu JB(3), Onishi H(1),Tsuji T(4).Author information: (1)1 Niigata University of Health and Welfare, Niigata, Japan.(2)2 Shijonawate Gakuen University, Osaka, Japan.(3)3 University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.(4)4 Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Older adults who have survived cancer experience significantly more fallscompared with healthy adults. Adult cancer survivors may also have a lowerbalance function than healthy adults. We examined muscle strength and balancefunction among 19 cancer survivors and 14 healthy subjects. The mean age of thecancer survivors was 51.5 ± 11.2 years; 6 men and 13 women. Cancer diagnosesincluded breast cancer, retroperitoneal sarcoma, acute leukemia, lung cancer,colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, Ewing's sarcoma, and tongue cancer. The meanage of healthy subjects was 47.4 ± 14 years; 3 men, 11 women. Muscle strength wasassessed using hand grip and knee extensor strength tests. Balance function wasevaluated using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and body sway was tested using a force platform. No significant differences were found with respect to right andleft grip strength or right and left knee extension strength between the 2groups. A significantly higher TUG time was observed in cancer survivors than in healthy subjects ( P < .05). With eyes open, the area of the center of pressurewas significantly larger in cancer survivors than in healthy subjects ( P < .05).Similarly, the length per area was significantly lower both with eyes open andclosed for cancer survivors than for healthy subjects ( P < .05). TUG wassignificantly correlated with muscle strength in both groups ( P < .05). However,no body sway parameters were related to muscle strength in either group. Cancersurvivors had lower balance function that might not have been related to musclestrength. Cancer survivors should be evaluated for balance function as there is apotential for impairment. The findings of this study will be relevant forplanning the prevention of falls for cancer survivors.DOI: 10.1177/1534735418790387 PMID: 30043664
