For the middle point on the mastectomyscar an almost moderate positive correlation with gross elasticity was found aswell (0.38, p = 0.04) 2) Content and face validity have been found to be good.Eighty-nine percent of the respondent found the instructions understandable and98% found the scoring system obvious. Thirty-seven percent of the therapistssuggested to add the possibility to evaluate additional anatomical locations incase of reconstructive and/or bilateral surgery.CONCLUSIONS: The MAP-BC evaluation tool for myofascial adhesions in breast cancerpatients has good face and content validity. Evidence for good concurrentvalidity of the skin level was found only on the mastectomy scar itself.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193915 PMCID: PMC5844553PMID: 29522540  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
