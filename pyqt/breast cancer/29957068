These compounds were screened for cell cycle disturbance and apoptosisinduction. They were found to cause PreG1Â apoptosis and complete cell growtharrest at G2/M. They induce apoptosis via caspase-3 and Bax activation anddownregulation of Bcl2.CONCLUSION: benzo[f][1,4]oxazepine represents a scaffold for further optimizationto obtain promising anticancer agents.DOI: 10.4155/fmc-2018-0068 PMID: 29957068
