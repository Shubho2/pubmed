[Epub ahead of print]Drug-Drug Interaction Study of Apixaban with Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus inHealthy Volunteers.Bashir B(1)(2), Stickle DF(3), Chervoneva I(1), Kraft WK(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacologyand Experimental Therapeutics, Thomas JeffersonUniversity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.(2)Department of Medical Oncology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia,Pennsylvania, USA.(3)Department of Pathology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia,Pennsylvania, USA.Apixaban is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 in the liver and intestine, undergoes direct intestinal excretion, and is a substrate to permeabilityglycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters. We examined the drug interactions between cyclosporine and tacrolimus (combinedinhibitors of CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP) with apixaban in 12 healthy adult malevolunteers. Apixaban 10 mg was administered orally alone, in combination with100 mg cyclosporine or 5 mg tacrolimus. Co-administration with cyclosporineresulted in increase in apixaban maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) and areaunder the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiableconcentration (AUC(0-tlast) ) with associated geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and90% confidence intervals (CIs) of 143% (112, 183) and 120% (97, 148),respectively. Co-administration with tacrolimus resulted in reduction in apixabanCmax and AUC(0-tlast) with associated GMRs (90% CI) of 87% (69, 112) and 78% (63,97), respectively. The observed changes in apixaban exposure margins withcyclosporine or tacrolimus are within the range of the historical clinicaldevelopment program, therefore, apixaban dose adjustments are not warranted.© 2018 The Authors.
