However, the molecular and cellularmechanisms whereby PKCζ regulates tumorigenesis and metastasis are still notfully understood. In this study, proteomics and bioinformatics analyses wereperformed to establish a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network associatedwith PKCζ, laying a stepping stone to further understand the diverse biologicalroles of PKCζ.Methods: Protein complexes associated with PKCζ were purified byco-immunoprecipitation from breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 and identified byLC-MS/MS. Two biological replicates and two technical replicates were analyzed.The observed proteins were filtered using the CRAPome database to eliminate thepotential false positives. The proteomics identification results were combinedwith PPI database search to construct the interactome network. Gene ontology (GO)and pathway analysis were performed by PANTHER database and DAVID. Next, theinteraction between PKCζ and protein phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit alpha(PPP2CA) was validated by co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting andimmunofluorescence. Furthermore, the TCGA database and the COSMIC database wereused to analyze the expressions of these two proteins in clinical samples.Results: The PKCζ centered PPI network containing 178 nodes and 1225 connections was built. Network analysis showed that the identified proteins weresignificantly associated with several key signaling pathways regulating cancerrelated cellular processes.Conclusions: Through combining the proteomics and bioinformatics analyses, a PKCζcentered PPI network was constructed, providing a more complete picture regardingthe biological roles of PKCζ in both cancer regulation and other aspects ofcellular biology.DOI: 10.1186/s12953-018-0134-8 PMCID: PMC5828088PMID: 29491746
