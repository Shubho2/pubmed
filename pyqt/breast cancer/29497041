The integrity of these structures is regulated by extracellular and intracellular signals andpathways that act on the functional units of cell adhesion such as the celladhesion molecules/adhesion receptors, the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteinsand the cytoplasmic plaque/peripheral membrane proteins. In advanced cancer,these regulatory pathways are dysregulated and lead to cell-cell adhesiondisassembly, increased invasion and metastasis. The Metastasis suppressor protein1 (MTSS1) plays a key role in the maintenance of cell-cell adhesions and its losscorrelates with tumour progression in a variety of cancers. However, themechanisms that regulate its function are not well-known. Using a system biology approach, we unravelled potential interacting partners of MTSS1. We found thatthe secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 1 (SCAMP1), a molecule involvedin post-Golgi recycling pathways and in endosome cell membrane recycling,enhances Mtss1 anti-invasive function in HER2+/ER-/PR- breast cancer, bypromoting its protein trafficking leading to elevated levels of RAC1-GTP andincreased cell-cell adhesions. This was clinically tested in HER2 breast cancertissue and shown that loss of MTSS1 and SCAMP1 correlates with reduceddisease-specific survival. In summary, we provide evidence of the cooperativeroles of MTSS1 and SCAMP1 in preventing HER2+/ER-/PR- breast cancer invasion and we show that the loss of Mtss1 and Scamp1 results in a more aggressive cancercell phenotype.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0364-9 PMCID: PMC5832821PMID: 29497041
