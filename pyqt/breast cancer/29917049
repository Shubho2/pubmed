HRD levels can be estimatedusing various mutational signatures from next generation sequencing data and weused this approach to determine whether breast cancer brain metastases showaltered levels of HRD scores relative to their corresponding primary tumor.Patients and methods: We used a previously published next generation sequencingdataset of twenty-one matched primary breast cancer/brain metastasis pairs toderive the various mutational signatures/HRD scores strongly associated with HRD.We also performed the myChoice HRD analysis on an independent cohort of seventeenbreast cancer patients with matched primary/brain metastasis pairs.Results: All of the mutational signatures indicative of HRD showed a significant increase in the brain metastases relative to their matched primary tumor in thepreviously published whole exome sequencing dataset. In the independentvalidation cohort the myChoice HRD assay showed an increased level in 87.5% ofthe brain metastases relative to the primary tumor, with 56% of brain metastases being HRD positive according to the myChoice criteria.Conclusions: The consistent observation that brain metastases of breast cancertend to have higher HRD measures may raise the possibility that brain metastases may be more sensitive to PARP inhibitor treatment. This observation warrantsfurther investigation to assess whether this increase is common to othermetastatic sites as well, and whether clinical trials should adjust theirstrategy in the application of HRD measures for the prioritization of patientsfor PARP inhibitor therapy.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy216 PMID: 29917049
