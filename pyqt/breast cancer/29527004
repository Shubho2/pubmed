Here, weaddressed the function of miR-155 using LC-MS/MS-based metabolic profiling ofmiR-155 deficient breast cancer cells. Our results revealed the loss of miR-155hampers glucose uptake and glycolysis, via the down-regulation of glucosetransporters and metabolic enzymes including HK2, PKM2, and LDHA. We showed this is due to the down-regulation of cMYC, controlled throughphosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit alpha (PIK3R1)-PDK1/AKT-FOXO3apathway. UTR analysis of the PIK3R1 and FOXO3a indicated miR-155 directlyrepresses these genes. A stable expression of miR-155 in patient-derived cells(PDCs) showed activated glucose metabolism whereas a stable inhibition of miR-155reduced in vivo tumor growth with retarded glucose metabolism. Furthermore,analysis of 50 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) specimens and specific uptakevalue (SUV) of PET images revealed a positive correlation between miR-155 leveland glucose usage in human breast tumors via PIK3R1-PDK/AKT-FOXO3a-cMYC axis.Collectively, these data demonstrate the miR-155 is a key regulator of glucosemetabolism in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0124-4 PMCID: PMC5978802PMID: 29527004
