The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of mucosal and cutaneous HPV in tumours from Moroccan BC patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Frozen tumours from 76 BC cases and 12 controls wereevaluated for the presence of 62 HPV-types using highly sensitive assays thatcombine multiplex polymerase chain reaction and bead-based Luminex technology.RESULTS: HPV DNA was found in 25.0% of BC tumours and only 8.3% of controls. Betaand gamma HPV types were found in 10.5% and 6.6% of BC tumours, respectively.High-risk mucosal types HPV16 and 18 were not detected in the subjects, but otherprobable/possible high-risk or high-risk -HPV types (HPV51, 52, 58, 59, and 66)were found in 5.3% of BC tumours. Statistical analysis showed no significantdifference between, controls, BC cases and the inflammatory status (p > 0.05).CONCLUSION: HPV DNA was found 3 times as frequently in the BC tumours as in thecontrols. However, this difference requires confirmation in a larger sample.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.DOI: 10.1016/j.pvr.2018.04.003 PMCID: PMC5909064PMID: 29660489
