Electronic address: zhaocs@mail.sysu.edu.cn.Therapeutic effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) are limited by the selectivity of photosensitizer (PS). Herein, a novel tumor-targeted drug-PS conjugate(Gan-ZnPc) which integrated with zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and Ganetespib hasbeen developed. ZnPc is a promising PS with remarkable photosensitizationability. Ganetespib is a heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor withpreferential tumor selectivity and conjugated to ZnPc as a tumor-targeted ligand.The multifunctional small molecule conjugate, Gan-ZnPc, could be bound toextracellular Hsp90 and then selectively internalized into the tumor cells,followed by the generation of abundant intracellular reactive oxygen species(ROS) upon irradiation. Besides, Gan-ZnPc can arrest cell proliferation andinduce apoptosis by the inhibition of Hsp90. Herein, with combination of theinhibition of Hsp90 and the generation of cytotoxic ROS, Gan-ZnPc implementstumor selectivity, concentrated PDT and chemotherapy in a synergistic manner,which results in highly effective anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
