Purpose: To assess theprevalence and intensity of symptoms among cancer patients receiving palliativecare in a Greek hospital and to examine the association between reported symptomsand social clinical and demographic characteristics. Material-methods: Thisdescriptive research was conducted during a sixmonth period using a convenientsample of 123 advanced cancer patients. All participants were assessed for their symptoms using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) with a questionnairecovering demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: The mean age was63.8± 10.8 years, with lung and breast (58.5% and 11.4%, respectively) as themost common primary cancer types. The most severe symptoms were fatigue, sleepdisturbance, dyspnea, depression and anxiety. Negative correlations were revealedbetween age and the following symptoms: pain (r = -0.354, p = 0.001), fatigue (r = -0.280, p = 0.002), nausea (r = -0.178, p = 0.049), anorexia (r = -0.188, p =0.038), dyspnea (r = -0.251, p = 0.005), and depression (r = -0.223, p = 0.013). Advanced breast cancer patients scored higher in pain, fatigue and dyspneacompared to those with other cancers. Conclusions: Hospitalized cancer patientsin Greece experience several symptoms during the last months of their life. Theseare influenced by demographic characteristics. Appropriate interventions arestrongly advised with appropriate recognition and evaluation of symptoms byhealth professionals.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.1047 PMCID: PMC6031771PMID: 29699055
