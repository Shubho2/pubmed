Patient health system usage and costs werealso assessed.METHODS: A multiple-baseline study across three sites. The RT Prepareintervention comprised two consultations with a radiation therapist: prior totreatment planning and on the first day of treatment. Radiation therapistsfocused on providing sensory and procedural information and addressing patients' pre-treatment anxiety. Usual care data were collected prior to interventioncommencement. Data collection occurred: after meeting their radiation oncologist,prior to treatment planning, first day of treatment and after treatmentcompletion. Multilevel mixed effects regression models were used.RESULTS: In total, 218 usual care and 190 intervention patients participated.Compared with usual care, intervention participants reported lower psychological distress at treatment commencement (p = 0.01); lower concerns about radiotherapy (p < 0.01); higher patient knowledge (p < 0.001); higher preparedness forprocedural concerns (p < 0.001) and higher preparedness for sensory-psychologicalconcerns at treatment planning (p < 0.001). Mean within-trial costs per patientwere estimated at $AU159 (US$120); mean ongoing costs at $AU35 (US$26).CONCLUSION: The RT Prepare intervention was effective in reducing breast cancerpatients' psychological distress and preparing patients for treatment. Thisintervention provides an opportunity for radiation therapists to extend theirrole into providing patients with information and support prior to treatment toreduce psychological distress.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0112-z PMID: 29855611
