NOD1 and NOD2 are innate immune receptors responsible for sensing a subset of bacterial-derived components, and to further translate thesepathogenic signals through pro-inflammatory and survival pathways. NOD1 and NOD2 have been further associated with tumorigenesis, particularly in gastrointestinalcancers. NOD1 has also been suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene in a model ofestrogen receptor-dependent breast cancer. Contrarily, NOD2 polymorphisms areassociated with higher risk of breast cancer, with no tumor suppressor role beingreported. To better delineate this issue, we investigated NOD1 and NOD2expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines, as well as their potentialimpact in breast tumorigenesis based on in vitro assays.RESULTS: The highly invasive Hs578T breast cell line presented the second highestNOD1 expression and the lowest NOD2 expression in our panel. Therefore, weinvestigated whether NOD1 and/or NOD2 might act as a tumor suppressor in thiscell model. Our studies indicate that overexpression of either NOD1 or NOD2reduces cell proliferation and increases clonogenic potential in vitro.Elucidation of NOD1 and NOD2 effects on tumor cell viability and proliferationmay unveil potential targets for future therapeutic intervention.DOI: 10.1186/s13104-018-3335-4 PMCID: PMC5883347PMID: 29615116
