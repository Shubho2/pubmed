Herewith, we investigated for the first time the effect ofN-(p-coumaroyl) serotonin (CS), isolated from Centaurea seed on a drug-resistant breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cells. Viability and proliferation of the cells wereexamined with trypan blue exclusion assay and3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Caspace-8,cell cycle, and CD24/CD44/CD56/ CD58/CD71/CD15 expression were tested with flowcytometry.RESULTS: Treatment with CS significantly reduced cell viability. Induction ofcell death and cell cycle arrest was confirmed with flow cytometry. Aftertreatment with CS, there was a dose-dependent decrease in CD24/CD44/CD58/CD71expression, whereas there was no change in CD56 and CD15 expression.CONCLUSION: The treatment of breast cancer cells with CS may represent a noveltherapeutic strategy and requires further investigation.PMID: 29552772
