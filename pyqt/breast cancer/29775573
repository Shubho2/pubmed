Therefore, the objective of the present study is toimprove the therapeutic efficacy and prevention of doxorubicin (DOX)-inducedtoxicity, by the concurrent use of Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C). In this study, I3Cwas administered (20 mg/kg b.w., p.o.) to breast adenocarcinoma (Ehrlich ascites carcinoma) induced solid tumor bearing mice alone as well as in combination with DOX (5 mg/kg b.w., i.p.) in concomitant and pretreatment schedule. The resultsshowed that concurrent administration of I3C and DOX significantly (P < 0.05)improved therapeutic efficacy as evidenced by reduction of tumor size andenhancement of host survivability. Oral administration of I3C significantly(P < 0.05) inhibited the expression of NF-κβ in both tumor cells and cardiactissue as well as maximizes the therapeutic outcome in terms of tumor cellkilling and toxicity. In addition, I3C sensitized tumor cells to DOX-therapy bydown-regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and byup-regulating molecules like Bax, cytochrome c, caspases, which led to PARPcleavage and apoptosis. Significant inhibition of angiogenesis along withreduction in the serum levels of VEGF-A and MMP-9 further contribute to thesensitization accomplished by I3C. Moreover, we also found that I3C providedadditional host survival advantages by attenuated DOX-induced toxicities through modulation of Nrf2/ARE pathway and promoted expression of cytoprotective proteinsHO-1, NQO1 and GSTπ in cardiac tissue. In addition, I3C significantly attenuated DOX-induced inflammation by down-regulation of NF-kβ, iNOS, COX-2 and IL-6 incardiac tissue. Thus, the present study clearly suggested therapeutic benefit of I3C in combination with DOX by augmenting anticancer efficacy and diminishingtoxicity to the host.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
