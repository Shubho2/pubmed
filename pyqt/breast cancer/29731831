Furthermore, folate receptor (FR)βexhibits an M2-like functional profile. In the present study, CD68 and CD163 wereused to evaluate and classify tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The expressionof CD68, CD163 and FRβ by TAMs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Tissues wasinvestigated. Samples from 105 patients with HCC were evaluated usingimmunohistochemistry. The results revealed that CD68 and CD163 overexpression wasassociated with a worse prognosis. The number of CD68 positive cells observed wassignificantly higher in patients with stage IV cancer. Furthermore, an increasein CD68 positive cells was observed in patients with median tumor size ≥3.5 cmand in patients with poorly differentiated HCC. The number of CD163 positivecells was also significantly increased in patients with median tumor size ≥3.5 cmand in those with poorly differentiated HCC. A low CD163/68 ratio was correlated with a worse outcome. The ratio was significantly lower in patients with stage IVcancer, patients with des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin abnormalities, patients with blood vessel infiltration and patients with intrahepatic metastasis. The numberof FRβ positive cells was not correlated with clinicopathological features. Theresults of the present study indicate that overexpression of CD68 and CD163 maybe associated with a worse patient outcome. The evaluation of CD68 and CD163positive cells in a cancer microenvironment is controversial. TAMs are not simplycells with single markers or restricted M1 or M2 phenotypes; they are morediverse and heterogeneous. Further studies are required to determine thecross-interaction between diverse TAMs and the tumor microenvironment.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2018.5959 PMCID: PMC5920942PMID: 29731831
