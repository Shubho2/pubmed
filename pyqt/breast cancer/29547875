Electronicaddress: rajendraprasad.vvs@viper.ac.in.Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) leads to the emergence of multidrugresistance (MDR) in cancer treatment. Acridones have the potential to reverse MDRand sensitize cells. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate thechemosensitization potential of acridones by employing various molecularmodelling techniques. Pharmacophore modeling was performed for the dataset ofchemosensitizing acridones earlier proved for cytotoxic activity against MCF7breast cancer cell line. Gaussian-based QSAR studies also performed to predictthe favored and disfavored region of the acridone molecules. Molecular dynamicssimulations were performed for compound 10 and human P-glycoprotein (obtainedfrom Homology modeling). An efficient pharmacophore containing 2 hydrogen bondacceptors and 3 aromatic rings (AARRR.14) was identified. NCI 2012 chemicaldatabase was screened against AARRR.14 CPH and identified 25 best-fit molecules. Potential regions of the compound were identified through Field (Gaussian) based QSAR. Regression analysis of atom-based QSAR resulted in r2 of 0.95 and q2 of0.72, whereas, regression analysis of field-based QSAR resulted in r2 of 0.92 andq2 of 0.87 along with r2cv as 0.71. The fate of the acridone molecule (compound10) in the P-glycoprotein environment is analyzed through analyzing theconformational changes occurring during the molecular dynamics simulations.Combined data of different in silico techniques provided basis for deeperunderstanding of structural and mechanistic insights of interaction phenomenon ofacridones with P-glycoprotein and also as strategic basis for designing morepotent molecules for anti-cancer and multidrug resistance reversal activities.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
