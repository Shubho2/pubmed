One such factor is stromal fibrosis, a histopathologic negativeprognostic criterion for invasive breast cancer. Since the stromal composition ofthe breast is largely adipose and fibroblast tissue, it is important tounderstand how alterations in these tissues affect cancer progression. To addressthis question, a novel transgenic animal model was developed by crossingMMTV-NeuT mice containing a constitutively active ErbB2 gene into the FAT-ATTAC(fat apoptosis through targeted activation of caspase 8) background, whichexpresses an inducible caspase 8 fusion protein targeted to mammary adiposetissue. Upon caspase 8 activation, lipoatrophy of the mammary gland results instromal fibrosis and acceleration of mammary tumor development with an increasein tumor multiplicity. Fibrosis was accompanied by an increase in collagendeposition, Î±-smooth muscle actin and CD31 expression in the tumor stroma as wellas an increase in PD-L1-positive tumor cells, and infiltration by regulatory Tcells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages. Geneexpression and signal transduction profiling indicated upregulation of pathwaysassociated with cytokine signaling, inflammation and proliferation. This modelshould be useful for evaluating new therapies that target desmoplasia in the TME associated with invasive cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24233 PMCID: PMC5814280PMID: 29487713
