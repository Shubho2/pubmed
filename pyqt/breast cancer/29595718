Palpable lesions were detected at a smaller size in augmentation patients (1.6 cm versus 2.3 cm; p <0.001). Fewer lesions in augmented patients were detected by screeningmammography (77.8 percent of cases versus 90.7 percent of controls; p = 0.010).Patients with implants were more likely to undergo an excisional biopsy fordiagnosis (20.5 percent versus 4.4 percent; p < 0.001), rather than image-guided core needle biopsy (77.3 percent versus 95.3 percent; p < 0.001). Earlier stagingin augmented patients approached but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.073). Augmented patients had higher mastectomy rates (74.5 percent versus 57.0 percent) and lower rates of breast-conservation therapy (25.5 percent versus 43percent; p = 0.023). Neither implant fill type nor anatomic location affectedmethod of diagnosis, stage, or treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Palpable detection of breast cancer is more likely at a smaller sizein augmented patients, yet it is less likely on screening mammography than incontrols. Augmentation breast cancer patients have a comparable disease stage andare more likely to undergo mastectomy rather than lumpectomy. Both silicone andsaline implants, whether placed submuscularly or subglandularly, have comparable effects on breast imaging, biopsy modality, and surgical intervention.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004196 PMID: 29595718
