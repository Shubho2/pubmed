The aim of this study was to examine the impact of receptorphenotype in patients with nodal metastases who undergo NAC to see whether thisapproach can identify those who may be suitable for conservative axillarymanagement.Methods: Between 2009 and 2014, all patients with breast cancer and biopsy-provennodal disease who received NAC were identified from prospectively developeddatabases. Details of patients who had axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)following NAC were recorded and rates of pathological complete response (pCR)were evaluated for receptor phenotype.Results: Some 284 patients with primary breast cancer and nodal metastasesunderwent NAC and subsequent ALND, including two with bilateral disease. The mostcommon receptor phenotype was luminal A (154 of 286 tumours, 53·8 per cent), withlesser proportions accounted for by the luminal B-Her2 type (64, 22·4 per cent), Her2-overexpressing (38, 13·3 per cent) and basal-like, triple-negative (30, 10·5per cent) subtypes. Overall pCR rates in the breast and axilla were 19·9 per cent(54 of 271 tumours) and 37·4 per cent (105 of 281) respectively. Axillary pCRrates were highest in the Her2-overexpressing group (27 of 35, 77 per cent) andlowest in the luminal A group (35 of 153, 22·9 per cent) (P < 0·001). Nodalburden (median number of positive nodes excised) was lower in theHer2-overexpressing group compared with the luminal A group (0 versus 3;P < 0·001).Conclusion: Her2 positivity was associated with increased rates of axillary pCRand reduced nodal burden following NAC.DOI: 10.1002/bjs5.6 PMCID: PMC5989970PMID: 29951604
