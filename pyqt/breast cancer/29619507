Assessment of theresponse of 98 patients was made. The overall objective response rate was 42.9%(95% CI 32.9-52.8%), with two complete responses and 40 partial responses. Thedisease control was 79.6% (95% CI 71.5-87.7%). With 29 months of the median time of follow-up, the median progression-free survival was 5.8 months (95% CI4.30-7.30 months) and the median overall survival was 11.5 months (95% CI9.08-13.9 months). The 1-year survival rate was 48.0%. The most common grades 3and 4 toxicities included neutropenia (32.7%), leucopenia (17.8%), fatigue(5.61%), and anemia (4.67%). Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 23.4% patients andgrade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy occurred in 12.1% of the patients.CONCLUSIONS: Combination chemotherapy with PTX and OXA offers a new, effectiveand safe regimen for patients with advanced gastric cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3576-x PMID: 29619507
