Recall rate is a principal performancemetric for screening mammography because it directly relates to the rate offalse-positive examinations. This study aims to compare the recall rate derivedusing two sources-the claims-based Hospital Compare (HC) dataset from the Centersfor Medicare & Medicaid Services versus the National Mammography Database (NMD)from the American College of Radiology-to understand the implications inpay-for-performance and quality improvement activities.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively compared the recall ratereported by NMD facilities with that reported in the HC dataset. Site matchingwas performed by facility name and zip code, followed by manual verification.Scatterplots, correlations, a paired t test, and Bland-Altman analysis wereperformed to assess association between the two measures.RESULTS: During the period from October 1 to December 1, 2016, 92 facilities wereunambiguously matched using 2014-2015 records in both datasets. The recall rates were positively correlated (r = 0.428, p < 0.001), but the mean HC recall rate(8.5% ± 2.86% [SD]) was significantly (p < 0.001) lower than the mean NMD recall rate (10.6% ± 3.90%).CONCLUSION: The NMD and HC are two commonly used datasets for measuring screeningmammography recall rate. Although recall rates are correlated at the individualfacility level, there are important differences that have implications forquality improvement and pay-for-performance.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.19229 PMID: 29792737
