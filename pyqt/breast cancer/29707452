Wepresent a novel technique of raising a pedicled descending branch latissimusdorsi (LD) mini-flap for reconstruction of PM defects via an axillary incision.After PM, the LD mini-flap is harvested through the existing axillary incision ofthe axillary dissection or the sentinel lymph node biopsy. The descendingbranches of thoracodorsal vessels and nerve are carefully identified andisolated. The transverse branches are protected to maintain muscle innervationand function. The LD muscle is then undermined posteriorly and inferiorly tocreate a submuscular pocket and a subcutaneous pocket between LD muscle andsuperficial fascia. Once the submuscular plane is created, the muscle is divided along the muscle fibers from the deep surface including a layer of fat above the muscle. Finally, the LD mini-flap is transferred to the breast defect. Given the limited length and mobility of the LD mini-flap, this approach is best utilizedfor lateral breast defects. However, for medial defects, the lateral breasttissue is rearranged to reconstruct the medial breast defect, and an LD mini-flapis then used to reconstruct the lateral breast donor site. This technique cantherefore be employed to reconstruct all quadrants of the breast and can provide aesthetic outcomes without scars on the back, with minimal dysfunction of LDmuscle.DOI: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000001692 PMCID: PMC5908510PMID: 29707452
