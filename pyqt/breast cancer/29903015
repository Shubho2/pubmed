Though the exact function of the protein isnot fully known, its expression has been reported to be upregulated in humanbreast cancer.We focused on studying the expression of mammaglobin-B gene andprotein in canine mammary tumor (CMT) tissue. Expression of mammaglobin-B mRNAand protein were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively.RESULTS: High levels of mammaglobin-B mRNA expression (6.663 ± 0.841times) wasobserved in CMT as compared to age and breed matched healthy controls. Further,expression of mammaglobin-B protein was detected in paraffin-embedded mammarytumor tissues from the same subjects by IHC. Mammaglobin-B protein wasoverexpressed only in 6.67% of healthy mammary glands while, a high level of its expression was scored in 76.7% of the CMT subjects. Moreover, no significantdifferences in terms of IHC score and qRT-PCR score with respect to CMThistotypes or tumor grades were observed, indicating that mammaglobin-Bover-expression occurred irrespective of CMT types or grades.CONCLUSION: Overall, significantly increased expression of mammaglobin-B protein was found in CMTs with respect to healthy mammary glands, which positivelycorrelates to its transcript. These findings suggest that overexpression ofmammaglobin-B is associated with tumors of canine mammary glands.DOI: 10.1186/s12917-018-1507-z PMCID: PMC6003043PMID: 29903015
