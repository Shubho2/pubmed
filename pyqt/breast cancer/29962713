A total of171 new diagnosed carcinoma breast patients who underwent staging 18F-FDG PET/CT scan and routine conventional imaging including mammosonography of breast andaxilla, chest X-ray, ultrasound sonography abdomen, and bone scan were includedin the study. Staging was done according to the American Joint Committee onCancer staging (tumor-node-metastasis). Changes in staging and management with18F-FDG PET/CT scan were assessed.Results: Overall PET/CT upstaged in 22.2% of cases and changed management in15.78% of cases. PET/CT upstaged in three of eight cases in Stage IA patients butchanged management in only one case. In Stage IIA, of 31 patients PET/CT upstagedin two patients (6.45%). In Stage IIB, of 45 patients PET/CT upstaged in sixpatients (13.3%). In Stage IIIA, of 22 patients PET/CT upstaged in six patients(27.2) and in five patients there is a change in management. In Stage IIIB, of 43patients PET/CT upstaged in 21 patients (48.8%) with change in management in 13patients (25.5%).Conclusion: 18F-FDG PET/CT scan can be helpful in a significant number ofpatients with Stage IIB and above in upstaging and changing management.DOI: 10.4103/ijnm.IJNM_52_18 PMCID: PMC6011560PMID: 29962713
