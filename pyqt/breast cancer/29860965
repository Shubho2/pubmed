[Epub ahead ofprint]Early breast cancer: why does obesity affect prognosis?Heetun A(1), Cutress RI(1), Copson ER(1).Author information: (1)Cancer Sciences Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine,University ofSouthampton,Somers Cancer Sciences Building,Southampton General Hospital,Tremona Road, Southampton SO16 6YD,UK.High BMI is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in post-menopausalwomen but poorer outcomes in all age groups. The underlying mechanism is likelyto be multi-factorial. Patients with a high BMI may present later due to bodyhabitus. Some studies have also indicated an increased incidence of biologically adverse features, including a higher frequency of oestrogen receptor (ERnegative) tumours, in obese patients. Obese patients have a higher frequency ofsurgical complications, potentially delaying systemic therapies, and reportssuggest that chemotherapy and endocrine therapy are less effective in patientswith BMI â‰¥30 kg/m2.High BMI is generally interpreted as excess adiposity and aWorld Cancer Research Fund report judged that the associations between BMI andincidence of breast cancer were due to body fatness. However, BMI cannotdistinguish lean mass from fat mass, or characterise body fat distribution. Most chemotherapy drugs are dosed according to calculated body surface area (BSA).Patients with a similar BSA or BMI may have wide variations in their distributionof adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (body composition); however, few studieshave looked at the effect of this on chemotherapy tolerance or effectiveness.Finally, adjuvant treatments for breast cancer can themselves result in bodycomposition changes.Research is required to fully understand the biologicalmechanisms by which obesity influences cancer behaviour and the impact of obesityon treatment effectiveness and tolerance so that specific management strategiescan be developed to improve the prognosis of this patient group.DOI: 10.1017/S0029665118000447 PMID: 29860965
