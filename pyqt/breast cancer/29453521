Radioactive seedlocalization overcomes these disadvantages, but implementation is limited due to radiation safety requirements. Magnetic seeds potentially offer the logisticalbenefits and transcutaneous detection equivalence of a radioactive seed, witheasier implementation. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility andsafety of using magnetic seeds for breast lesion localization.METHODS: A two-centre open-label cohort study to assess the feasibility andsafety of magnetic seed (Magseed) localization of breast lesions. Magseeds wereplaced under radiological guidance into women having total mastectomy surgery.The primary outcome measure was seed migration distance. Secondary outcomemeasures included accuracy of placement, ease of transcutaneous detection, seedintegrity and safety.RESULTS: Twenty-nine Magseeds were placed into the breasts of 28 patients underultrasound guidance. There was no migration of the seeds between placement andsurgery. Twenty-seven seeds were placed directly in the target lesion with theother seeds being 2 and 3Â mm away. All seeds were detectable transcutaneously in all breast sizes and at all depths. There were no complications or safety issues.CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic seeds are a feasible and safe method of breast lesionlocalization. They can be accurately placed, demonstrate no migration in thisfeasibility study and are detectable in all sizes and depths of breast tissue.Now that safety and feasibility have been demonstrated, further clinical studies are required to evaluate the seed's effectiveness in wide local excision surgery.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4709-y PMCID: PMC5953977PMID: 29453521
