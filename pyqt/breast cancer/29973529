Carmen.Waengler@medma.uni-heidelberg.de.Heterobivalent peptidic ligands (HBPLs), designed to address two differentreceptors independently, are highly promising tumor imaging agents. For example, breast cancer has been shown to concomitantly and complementarily overexpress theneuropeptide Y receptor subtype 1 (NPY(Y₁)R) as well as the gastrin-releasingpeptide receptor (GRPR). Thus, radiolabeled HBPLs being able to bind these tworeceptors should exhibit an improved tumor targeting efficiency compared tomonospecific ligands. We developed here such bispecific HBPLs and radiolabeledthem with 68Ga, achieving high radiochemical yields, purities, and molaractivities. We evaluated the HBPLs and their monospecific reference peptides invitro regarding stability and uptake into different breast cancer cell lines and found that the 68Ga-HBPLs were efficiently taken up via the GRPR. We alsoperformed in vivo PET/CT imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies in T-47Dtumor-bearing mice for the most promising 68Ga-HBPL and compared the results tothose obtained for its scrambled analogs. The tumors could easily be visualizedby the newly developed 68Ga-HBPL and considerably higher tumor uptakes andtumor-to-background ratios were obtained compared to the scrambled analogs in andex vivo. These results demonstrate the general feasibility of the approach to usebispecific radioligands for in vivo imaging of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3390/ph11030065 PMID: 29973529
