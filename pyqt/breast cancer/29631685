DNA repair and apoptosis are estimated to becritical players of adverse effects in response to radiotherapy. Our aim was todefine the association of DNA repair (ERCC1 and XPC) and apoptotic (BCL2, CASP3and NFKB1) gene expression, DNA damage levels, apoptosis changes and DNA repairgene variations with the risk of acute side effects in breast cancer patients.The study included 100 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer; an experimental case group (n=50) with acute side effects and the control group (n=50) withoutside effects. Gene expression was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Micronucleus (MN) and8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) assays were performed to compare the DNAdamage levels. Apoptosis was examined by TDT-mediated dUTP-biotin nickend-labeling (TUNEL) staining. ERCC1 rs3212986 and XPC rs3731055 polymorphismswere genotyped by real-time PCR technique. No significantly correlation of DNArepair and apoptosis gene expression and DNA damage levels with acute sideeffects in response to radiotherapy. Also, there was no association betweenapoptosis levels and acute effects. ERCC1 rs3212986 CC genotype showed aprotective effect against radiotherapy-induced acute reactions (p&lt;0.001; OR:0.21; 95% CI= 0.08-0.52). Our results suggest that apoptosis and DNA damagelevels are not associated with acute radiosensitivity. DNA repair may affect the risk of acute reactions. Further studies are needed to validate the currentfindings.PMID: 29631685
