China.The present study was performed to explore the prognostic significance ofperiostin expression in a cohort of patients with early-stage breast cancertreated with breast conserving surgery following radiotherapy. A tissuemicroarray of tumor samples from 259 patients with early-stage breast cancer was assayed for periostin, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 and Ki-67 expression by immunohistochemistry. Theassociation of periostin with other clinicopathological parameters and clinicaloutcomes, including local recurrence free survival (RFS), distant metastasis freesurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), were assessed through log-rank testsand univariate and multivariate analysis. Periostin expression was identified in 91 of the 259 tissue samples (35%). The periostin status was significantlyassociated with histological grade (P=0.001), nodal status (P=0.023), molecularsubtype (P<0.01), ER status (P<0.01), PR status (P<0.01) and Ki-67 expression(P=0.011). Furthermore, periostin expression was associated with an increasedrisk of five-year local recurrence (95.8% vs. 89.0%; P=0.017) and distantmetastasis (92.3% vs. 79.1%; P=0.001) in patients with early stage breast cancer.Multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards model demonstrated thatperiostin expression was an independent predictor of all clinical outcomes inbreast cancer (RFS, P=0.018; DFS, P=0.025; OS, P=0.047). Therefore, it wasconcluded that periostin is associated with an increased risk of local relapseand distant metastasis in early-stage breast cancer treated with conservingsurgery and radiotherapy. This association should be further investigated inlarger cohorts to validate the clinical significance of periostin expression.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8310 PMCID: PMC5920502PMID: 29725485
