[Epub ahead of print]An integrative framework for protein interaction network and methylation data to discover epigenetic modules.Ma X, Sun PG, Zhang ZY.DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic modification that plays an importantrole in cancers. The available algorithms fail to fully characterize epigeneticmodules. To address this issue, we first characterize the epigenetic module as a group of well-connected genes in the protein interaction network and are alsoco-methylated based on gene methylation profiles. Then, the epigenetic modulediscovery problem is transformed into an optimization problem. Then, aregularized nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm for methylation modules(RNMF-MM) is presented, where the co-methylation constraint is treated as aregularizer. Using the artificial networks with known module structure, wedemonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approachesin terms of accuracy. On the basis of breast cancer methylation data and protein interaction network, the RNMF-MM algorithm discovers methylation modules that aresignificantly more enriched by the known pathways than those obtained by otheralgorithms. These modules serve as biomarkers for predicting cancer stages andestimating survival time of patients. The proposed model and algorithm provide aneffective way for the integrative analysis of protein interaction network andmethylation data.DOI: 10.1109/TCBB.2018.2831666 PMID: 29994031
