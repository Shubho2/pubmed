Successful translation of genomic medicine into clinical care will require that providers of this information areaware of the level of understanding, attitudes, perceived risks, benefits, andconcerns of their patients. We used a mixed methods approach to conduct in-depth interviews with participants in the NCI-funded Breast Cancer Family Registry(BCFR). Our goal was to gain a better understanding of attitudes towardsdifferent types and amounts of genomic information, current interest in pursuing genomic testing, and perceived risks and benefits. We interviewed 32 women fromthe six BCFR sites in the USA, Canada, and Australia. In this sample of womenwith a personal or family history of breast cancer, we found high acknowledgementof the potential of genetics/genomics to improve their own health and that oftheir family members through lifestyle changes or alterations in their medicalmanagement. Respondents were more familiar with cancer genetics than the geneticsof other diseases. Concerns about the testing itself included a potential senseof loss of control over health, feelings of guilt on passing on a mutation to achild, loss of privacy and confidentiality, questions about the test accuracy,and the potential uncertainty of the significance of test results. These dataprovide important insights into attitudes about the introduction of increasingly complex genetic testing, to inform interventions to prepare individuals for theintroduction of this new technology into their clinical care.DOI: 10.1007/s12687-018-0365-5 PMID: 29804257
