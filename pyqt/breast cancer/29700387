In particular, the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab represents the gold standard forthe treatment of HER2+ breast cancer patients. Its contribution in dampeningcancer progression is mainly attributed to the antibody-dependent cell-mediatedcytotoxicity (ADCC) rather than HER2 blockade. Here, multiple half chains oftrastuzumab were conjugated onto magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (MNP-HC) todevelop target-specific and biologically active nanosystems to enhance anti-HER2 therapeutic potential. HER2 targeting was assessed in different human breastcancer cell lines, where nanoparticles triggered site-specific phosphorylation inthe catalytic domain of the receptor and cellular uptake by endocytosis. MNP-HCinduced remarkable antiproliferative effect in HER2+ breast cancer cells,exhibiting enhanced activity compared to free drug. Accordingly, nanoparticlesinduced p27kip1 expression and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, without loosingcapability to prime ADCC. Finally, MNP-HC affected viability oftrastuzumab-resistant cells, suggesting interference with the resistancemachinery. Our findings indicate that multiple arrangement of trastuzumab halfchain onÂ the nanoparticle surface enhances anticancer efficacy in HER2+ breastcancer cells. Powerful inhibition of HER2 signaling could promote responsiveness of resistant cells, thus suggesting ways for drug sensitization.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-24968-x PMCID: PMC5920071PMID: 29700387
