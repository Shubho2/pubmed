Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)7 isnecessary for transcription, and acts by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain(CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PolII) to enable transcription initiation. CDK7additionally regulates the activities of a number of transcription factors,including estrogen receptor (ER)-α. Here we describe a new, orally bioavailableCDK7 inhibitor, ICEC0942. It selectively inhibits CDK7, with an IC50 of 40nmol/L; IC50 values for CDK1, CDK2, CDK5, and CDK9 were 45-, 15-, 230-, and30-fold higher. In vitro studies show that a wide range of cancer types aresensitive to CDK7 inhibition with GI50 values ranging between 0.2 and 0.3 μmol/L.In xenografts of both breast and colorectal cancers, the drug has substantialantitumor effects. In addition, combination therapy with tamoxifen showedcomplete growth arrest of ER-positive tumor xenografts. Our findings reveal that CDK7 inhibition provides a new approach, especially for ER-positive breast cancerand identify ICEC0942 as a prototype drug with potential utility as a singleagent or in combination with hormone therapies for breast cancer. ICEC0942 mayalso be effective in other cancers that display characteristics of transcription factor addiction, such as acute leukaemia and small-cell lung cancer.
