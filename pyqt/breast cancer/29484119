This study investigates macrophage polarization induced bytriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell-derived exosomes that promote lymphnode (LN) metastasis in orthotopic TNBC models. The MDA-MB-231 cancer cell lineexpressing the exosomal CD63-red fluorescence (RFP) fusion protein was generated to noninvasively visualize exosome transfer into cancer cells and macrophages.Administration of RFP-tagged exosomes enhanced migration of macrophages andinduced macrophage polarization in vitro. In orthotopic TNBC models, noninvasive bioluminescent imaging, ultrasound-guided photoacoustic imaging, and histologicalanalysis revealed that intravenous injection of RFP-tagged exosomes promotedprimary tumor growth and axillary LN metastasis in which expression of CD206, amarker or alternatively activated type 2 (M2) macrophages, was significantlyhigher than expression of NOS2, a marker of classically activated type 1 (M1)macrophages. These results suggest breast cancer cell-derived exosomes stimulate macrophage polarization that creates favorable conditions for LN metastaticprocesses in TNBC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23238 PMCID: PMC5800911PMID: 29484119
