Electronic address: mlj2963@qau.edu.cn.Milk lipids, important for infant growth and development, are produced andsecreted by mammary gland under the regulation of steroid hormones, growthfactors, and microRNAs (miRNAs). miR-221 has been identified in milk andadipocytes and it plays important roles in regulating normal mammary epithelialhierarchy and breast cancer stem cells; however, its roles in lipid metabolism inmammary epithelial cells (MECs), the cells of lipid synthesis and secretion, are as yet unknown. Through overexpression or inhibition of miR-221 expression, wefound that it regulated lipid metabolism in MECs and was expressed differentiallyat various stages during murine mammary gland development. Inhibition of miR-221 expression increased lipid content in MECs through elevation of the lipidsynthesis enzyme FASN, while overexpression of miR-221 reduced MEC lipid content.Moreover, the steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone decreased miR-221expression with a subsequent increase in lipid formation in MECs. The expression of miR-221 was lower during lactation, which suggests that it may be involved in milk production. Therefore, miR-221 might be a useful target for influencing milklipid production.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.biocel.2018.02.014 PMID: 29474925
