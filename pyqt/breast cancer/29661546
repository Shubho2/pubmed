The purpose ofthis paper is to confirm whether the number of metastases can be accuratelydiagnosed by preoperative computed tomography (CT), ultrasound sonography (US),and US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the axillary LNs finding of preoperativeCT/US of 470 breast cancer patients. Metastasis was suspected based on thefollowing findings: LNs with a long-axis diameter of ≥10 mm or a short-axisdiameter of ≥5 mm on CT, and LNs with the absence of a fatty hilum, focalcortical thickness or a cortical thickness ≥2 mm on US. We also examined theresults of FNAC making a rapid bedside diagnosis (bedside-FNAC) of 162 LNs thatwere suspected to metastatic based on the US findings.RESULTS: On CT, all cases with ≥3 LNs with a long-axis diameter of ≥10 mm and ashort-axis diameter of ≥5 mm had metastasis. However, there was no relationshipbetween the number of detected LNs and the number of metastases. On US, 75.7% of LNs with the absence of a fatty hilum and all LNs with cortical thickness ≥6 mmhad metastasis. The accuracy of bedside-FNAC for suspicious LNs was 100%.CONCLUSIONS: Although we can pick up LNs that are likely to have metastasis onCT/US, it was impossible to accurately predict the number of metastases on CT/US.However, bedside-FNAC of suspicious LNs could accurately predict the number ofmetastases.Copyright © 2018.
