Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-producing bacteria demonstrate achallenging problem for health care. Aim of the study was the biosynthesis ofAuNPs using Rosa damascenes petals extract and conjugation to ceftriaxoneantibiotic (Cef-AuNPs) to inhibit ESBL-producing bacteria and study assesses invitro anticancer activity. Characterization of the synthesized AuNPs andCef-AuNPs was studied. ESBL-producing strains, Acinetobacter baumannii ACI1 andPseudomonas aeruginosa PSE4 were used for testing the efficacy of Cef-AuNPs. The cells of MCF-7 Breast cancer were treated with previous AuNPs and Cef-AuNPs atdifferent time intervals. Cytotoxicity effect of apoptosis and its molecularmechanism were evaluated. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy established the formation of AuNPs and Cef-AuNPs.Transmission electron microscope demonstrated that the formed nanoparticles were of different shapes with size ~15-35 nm and the conjugation were established by aslight increase in size. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ofCef-AuNPs against tested strains were obtained as 3.6 and 4 μg/L, respectively.Cef-AuNPs demonstrated a decrease in the MIC of ceftriaxone down to more than 27 folds on the studied strains. The biosynthesized AuNPs displayed apoptotic andtime-dependent cytotoxic effects in the cells of MCF-7 at concentration of0.1μg/mL medium. The Cef-AuNPs have low significant effects on MCF-7 cells. Theseresults enhance the conjugating utility an old unresponsive ceftriaxone withAuNPs to restore its efficiency against otherwise resistant bacterial pathogens. Additionally, AuNPs may be used as an alternative chemotherapeutic treatment ofMCF-7 cancer cells.DOI: 10.4014.jmb/1711.11037 PMID: 30022648
