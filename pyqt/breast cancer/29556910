The aims of ourstudy were to evaluate the incidences and risk factors of second primary femalegenital cancers (corpus uteri, cervix uteri plus ovary) in a large cohort ofbreast cancer survivors. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results(SEER) database, we examined the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and riskfactors for second primary female genital cancers observed between 2000 and 2014.Breast cancer survivors had increased SIRs for second corpus uteri cancers andsecond ovarian cancers and a decreased SIR for second cervical cancers (SIR 1.17,1.12, and 0.64, respectively). Risk factors of second corpus uteri cancers werethe age at first cancer diagnosis, race (black vs. white, aHR = 1.142 95% CI1.005-1.298), and progesterone receptor (PR) status (PR+ vs. PR-, aHR = 1.131 95%CI 1.004-1.273). In addition, the risk of second ovarian cancer was positivelyassociated with age while inversely associated with race (black vs. white,aHR = 0.691 95% CI 0.555-0.859) and estrogen receptor (ER) status (ER+ vs. ER-,aHR = 0.655 95% CI 0.544-0.788). Age, race, and hormone receptor status are risk factors of developing second female genital cancers among breast cancersurvivors. Older age, black race, and a PR+ status in survivors are associatedwith a higher risk of second corpus uteri cancers. Additionally, older age and anER- status should increase vigilance for potential second ovarian cancers.DOI: 10.1007/s12672-018-0330-0 PMCID: PMC5945714PMID: 29556910
