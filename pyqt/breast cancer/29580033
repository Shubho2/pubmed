Although, chemotherapy is an important candidate in cancer treatment,but it has many side effects on healthy tissues of the body. Therefore, Nanotechnology is used for specific function, by the least side effects and damage tonormal cells. Materials and method: In this study, the pharmacological propertiesof PEGylated Nano-niosomal Gingerol was examined. Noisome were prepared usingreverse phase evaporation method, which contains specific proportion ofcholesterol, span60 and polyethylene glycol. Then, PEGylated the preparedformulation by PEG6600. The amount of release and encapsulation of the drug wasinvestigated. The percentage of remains of cancer cell line T47D treated withPEGylated niosomal Gingerol. Results: The average diameter of the nanoparticles, size distribution and zeta potential were reported for PEGylated niosomal sample 35.65 nm, 0.17 and 21 mv, and for PEGylated niosomal drug sample 256.9 nm, 0.23and 28 mv, respectively. The amount of OD for encapsulated drug was 0.198, alsothe amount of concentration of the drug which is not encapsulated, was 0.77947 Î¼lof the drug per ml. This value of encapsulated drug was 76.38 percent.Conclusion: The results showed that IC50 of the formulation of PEGylatednanoniosomal Gingerol is less than the standard drug. It seems, the cause of thisphenomenon is due to the effect of Polyethylene glycol, in more stability andslower drug release, in the formulation of PEGylated niosome. Also, Polyethylene glycol makes increase in the drug dealing and its greater influence with thetarget cell. In this study, more than 76% of the Gingerol drug in PEGylatednanoniosomal formulation were enclose. Also, we could reduce the amount of drugrelease, as much as possible.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.3.645 PMCID: PMC5980835PMID: 29580033
