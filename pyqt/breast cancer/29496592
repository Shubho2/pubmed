Therefore, discovering noveltherapies that are safe, efficacious and affordable are required for the bettermanagement of this disease. Tocotrienols, analogues of vitamin E have gainedincreased attention due to their safety and efficacy. Extensive research over thepast several years has strongly indicated that tocotrienols can efficientlyprevent/inhibit the growth of different cancers such as cancers of blood, brain, breast, cervical, colon, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach etc. Thisis mainly accredited to their ability to modulate various molecular targetsinvolved in cancer cell proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, andmetastasis such as NF-κB, STAT3, Akt/mTOR, etc. In addition, increasing lines of evidence has shown that tocotrienols can sensitize cancer cells tochemotherapeutic agents such as celecoxib, doxorubicin, erlotinib, gefitinib,gemcitabine, paclitaxel, statin etc. Moreover, several clinical trials haveconfirmed the safety and tolerability of tocotrienols in humans. This reviewsummarizes the potential of tocotrienols for the prevention and treatment ofdifferent cancers based on the available in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies.Copyright © 2018.
