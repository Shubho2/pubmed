However, many patients develop resistanceto tamoxifen, and the mechanism underlying tamoxifen resistance is not wellunderstood. Here we examined whether ER-c-Src-HER2 complex formation is involved in tamoxifen resistance.METHODS: MTT and colony formation assays were used to measure cell viability and proliferation. Western blot was used to detect protein expression and proteincomplex formations were detected by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence.SiRNA was used to examine the function of HER2 in of BT474 cells. An in vivoxenograft animal model was established to examine the role of c-Cbl in tumorgrowth.RESULTS: MTT and colony formation assay showed that BT474 cells are resistant to tamoxifen and T47D cells are sensitive to tamoxifen. Immunoprecipitationexperiments revealed ER-c-Src-HER2 complex formation in BT474 cells but not inT47D cells. However, ER-c-Src-HER2 complex formation was detected afteroverexpressing HER2 in T47D cells and these cells were more resistant totamoxifen. HER2 knockdown by siRNA in BT474 cells reduced ER-c-Src-HER2 complexformation and reversed tamoxifen resistance. ER-c-Src-HER2 complex formation was also disrupted and tamoxifen resistance was reversed in BT474 cells by the c-Src inhibitor PP2 and HER2 antibody trastuzumab. Nystatin, a lipid raft inhibitor,reduced ER-c-Src-HER2 complex formation and partially reversed tamoxifenresistance. ER-c-Src-HER2 complex formation was disrupted by overexpression ofc-Cbl but not by the c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase mutant. In addition, c-Cbl couldreverse tamoxifen resistance in BT474 cells, but the ubiquitin ligase mutant had no effect. The effect of c-Cbl was validated in BT474 tumor-bearing nude mice in vivo. Immunofluorescence also revealed ER-c-Src-HER2 complex formation wasreduced in tumor tissues of nude mice with c-Cbl overexpression.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that c-Cbl can reverse tamoxifen resistance inHER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells by inhibiting the formation of theER-c-Src-HER2 complex.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4387-5 PMCID: PMC5930956PMID: 29720121
