SMYD2 wasexpressed at significantly higher levels in breast cancer cell lines and inbreast tumor tissues. Silencing of SMYD2 by RNAi in triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) cell lines or inhibition of SMYD2 with its specific inhibitor, AZ505,significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. SMYD2 executes this activity viamethylation and activation of its novel non-histone substrates, including STAT3and the p65 subunit of NF-κB, leading to increased TNBC cell proliferation andsurvival. There are cross-talk and synergistic effects among SMYD2, STAT3, andNF-κB in TNBC cells, in that STAT3 can contribute to the modification of NF-κBp65 subunit post-translationally by recruitment of SMYD2, whereas the p65 subunitof NF-κB can also contribute to the modification of STAT3 post-translationally byrecruitment of SMYD2, leading to methylation and activation of STAT3 and p65 inthese cells. The expression of SMYD2 can be upregulated by IL-6-STAT3 andTNFα-NF-κB signaling, which integrates epigenetic regulation to inflammation inTNBC development. In addition, we have identified a novel SMYD2 transcriptionaltarget gene, PTPN13, which links SMYD2 to other known breast cancer associatedsignaling pathways, including ERK, mTOR, and Akt signaling via PTPN13 mediatedphosphorylation.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0347-x PMCID: PMC5832424PMID: 29487338
