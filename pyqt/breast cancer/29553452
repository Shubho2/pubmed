Female health-care workers' awareness of breastcancer screening is important because their beliefs and behaviours couldinfluence other women. The aim of this study was to assess mammography screening uptake by female health-care workers at primary health-care centres and toidentify the primary motivators and barriers that affect uptake.METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all governmental primary health-carecentres in the West Bank. Governorates were grouped into three regions asfollows: north West Bank (Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarm, Tubas, Qalqiliya, and Salfit), middle West Bank (Jerusalem, Jericho, and Ramallah), and south West Bank (Hebron,and Bethlehem). The study population included all female health-care workersolder than 40 years. Those who performed mammography for a suspected mass orother breast abnormalities were excluded. A self-administered questionnaire wasused to collect data on demographic characteristics, knowledge about mammography screening, the extent and regularity of mammography screening, and motivators andbarriers influencing their mammography screening uptake. The rate of mammography screening uptake was calculated. χ2 test and t tests were used to assessscreening motivators and barriers. The study was approved by the InstitutionalReview Board of the An-Najah National University. Participation was voluntary,and written consent was obtained from each participant.FINDINGS: 299 female health-care workers completed a self-administeredquestionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 46 years (SD 4·7). 284 (95%) women had adequate knowledge about breast cancer and mammography screening, and149 (50%) women reported having had at least one mammogram. 62 (21%) women hadhad regular scheduled mammograms. The most frequent reported motivators were the perceived benefit that early detection of breast cancer is important for itsmanagement (269 [90%] women) and the belief that mammography can detect breastcancer before its symptoms appear (251 [84%] women). The most frequent barrier tomammography screening was being busy (140 [47%] women) and the lack of perceived susceptibility (125 [42%] women).INTERPRETATION: Mammography screening was suboptimal in a population of femalehealth-care workers. Educational interventions are needed to remove barriers thatlimit compliance to recommendations and to emphasise the importance of earlydetection in breast cancer management. Ensuring the availability andaccessibility of screening services, particularly for health-care workers within their work settings, would improve the acceptance and compliance for mammography screening programmes.FUNDING: None.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
