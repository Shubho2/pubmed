Electronic address:charlie.wang@shenogen.com.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the common primary liver cancer and the thirdleading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide. It is generally thought thatthe estrogen-signaling pathway is not related to the development and progression of human HCC. However, accumulating evidences indicate the existence of a rapidestrogen signaling in HCC cells that is able to promote cell growth. However, thereceptor that mediates the rapid estrogen signaling in HCC cells has not beenestablished. Previously, our laboratory identified a variant of ER-α, ER-α36, andfound that ER-α36 mediates the rapid estrogen signaling such as the activation ofthe MAPK/ERK signaling in breast carcinoma cells. Our current experiments studiedthe role of the rapid estrogen signaling mediated by ER-α36 in growth of HCCHepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells that highly express ER-α36 and found these cells werestrongly responsive to the rapid estrogen signaling. Knockdown of ER-α36expression in these HCC cells using the shRNA method attenuated theirresponsiveness to estrogen and destabilized EGFR protein. ER-α36 mediatedestrogen-induced phosphorylation of Src and the MAPK/ERK as well as cyclin D1expression. In addition, there existed an ER-α36/EGFR positive regulatory loop inHCC cells that was important for the maintenance and positive regulation of HCCtumorsphere cells. Our results thus indicated that the rapid estrogen receptor ismediated by ER-α36 in HCC cells through the EGFR/Src/ERK signaling pathway andsuggested that the ER-α36/EGFR signaling loop is a potential target to developnovel therapeutic approaches for HCC treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
