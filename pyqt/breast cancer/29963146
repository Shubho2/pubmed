China.A number of studies have indicated that thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ1)functions as a tumor suppressor. TRs mediate transcriptional responses through a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD). A novel rat TRβ isoform (rTRβΔ) waspreviously identified, in which a novel exon, N (108 bp), is located betweenexons 3 and 4 within the DBD; this exon represents the only difference betweenrTRβΔ and rTRβ1. In vitro, rTRβΔ exhibits a stronger tumor-suppressive capacitythan rTRβ1, and further analysis revealed a high level of conservation betweenthe rat and human DBD sequences. In the present study, an artificially modifiedhuman TRβ1 (m-hTRβ1) was constructed via the introduction of the 108-bp sequence into the corresponding position of the wild-type human TRβ1 (wt-hTRβ1) DBD. Anelectrophoretic mobility shift assay and transfection experiments confirmed that m-hTRβ1 is functional. Overexpression of m-hTRβ1 inhibits the proliferation ofMDA-MB-468 cells in the presence of triiodothyronine by promoting apoptosis,which may be associated with the upregulation of Caspase-3 and Bak geneexpression and the activation of the Caspase-3 protein. In addition, thepro-apoptotic effect of m-hTRβ1 was stronger, compared with wt-hTRβ1. Theseresults indicated that m-hTRβ1 may act as a tumor suppressor in MDA-MB-468 cells.These data provided a novel insight into gene therapy for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8764 PMCID: PMC6019938PMID: 29963146
