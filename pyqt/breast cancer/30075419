Electronicaddress: cme_virendra@yahoo.co.in.This study explores the potential of dendritic unimolecular nanoconstruct,PAMAM-Tryptophan-(N-acetylglucosamine) [PTN] as anti-cancer drug delivery system.The PAMAM dendrimers were modified with L-tryptophan and N-acetyl glucosamine(NAG) for higher drug loading and to utilize GLUT transporters, respectively. Thenanocarriers were characterized by 1H NMR, DSC, and dynamic light scattering.Effect of doxorubicin (DOX)- loaded PTN was studied on MDA-MB-231 and HepG2 cellsby cell viability assay. Further flow cytometry analysis was carried out toassess apoptosis. Pre-treatment with NAG was carried out to keep GLUTtransporters continuously engaged and to determine GLUT targeting. Confocalmicroscopy demonstrated significantly higher uptake of FITC tagged PTN thanPAMAM. DOX-loaded PTN demonstrated pH-sensitive drug release with significant(P < 0.001) higher cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells than PAMAM. Thepercentage viability after 48 h was found to be 5.0 ± 2.32, 18.3 ± 2.91 and5.9 ± 0.55% for free DOX, PAMAM-DOX, and PTN-DOX, respectively in MDA-MB-231cells. A similar profile was observed for HepG2 cells. Further, flow cytometryanalysis confirmed that the cell death mode was apoptosis. Pre-treatment with NAGduring cell viability assay and flow cytometry evidenced GLUT targeting. Takentogether, conjugating tryptophan to parent dendrimer could significantly enhance cargo loading capacity and binding NAG could be an attractive therapeuticapproach for GLUT transporters mediated delivery of anticancer drugs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
