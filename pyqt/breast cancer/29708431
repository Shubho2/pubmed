All the compounds except 5g and 5e found to be less toxicfor the human dermal fibroblast cells. The effective interactions of thecompounds in silico with MDM2 exemplified their inhibitory potency. Thederivatives also showed moderate antimicrobial activity.CONCLUSION: The halogen atoms on various positions of the N-arylamino ring playedan advantageous role in elevating the potency of the molecules. Thus, theseconjugates could be used as a lead for further optimization to achieve promising therapeutics.DOI: 10.4155/fmc-2017-0191 PMID: 29708431
