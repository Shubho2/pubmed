The natural product salinomycin, a K+-selectiveionophore, was recently found to exert selectivity against such cancer stemcells. This selective effect is thought to be due to inhibition of the Wntsignaling pathway, but the mechanistic basis remains unclear. Here, we develop a functionally competent fluorescent conjugate of salinomycin to investigate themolecular mechanism of this compound. By subcellular imaging, we demonstrate arapid cellular uptake of the conjugate and accumulation in the endoplasmicreticulum (ER). This localization is connected to induction of Ca2+ release from the ER into the cytosol. Depletion of Ca2+ from the ER induces the unfoldedprotein response as shown by global mRNA analysis and Western blot analysis ofproteins in the pathway. In particular, salinomycin-induced ER Ca2+ depletionup-regulates C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), which inhibits Wnt signaling bydown-regulating β-catenin. The increased cytosolic Ca2+ also activates proteinkinase C, which has been shown to inhibit Wnt signaling. These results revealthat salinomycin acts in the ER membrane of breast cancer cells to cause enhancedCa2+ release into the cytosol, presumably by mediating a counter-flux of K+ ions.The clarified mechanistic picture highlights the importance of ion fluxes in the ER as an entry to inducing phenotypic effects and should facilitate rationaldevelopment of cancer treatments.DOI: 10.1021/acscentsci.8b00257 PMCID: PMC6026786PMID: 29974072
