Currently, multigene assays are widely used topredict the risk of relapse after surgery. Molecular targeted agents have beeninvestigated extensively, and some of them are clinically available to date. Thisreview focuses on precision medicine, especially, genome medicine, in breastcancer.DOI: 10.21037/cco.2018.06.04 PMID: 30056731
