Epub 2018 Mar1.1,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D prevents tumorigenesis by inhibiting oxidative stressand inducing tumor cellular senescence in mice.Chen L(1), Yang R(1), Qiao W(1), Yuan X(1), Wang S(2), Goltzman D(3), Miao D(1).Author information: (1)State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Department of Anatomy,Histology and Embryology, The Research Center for Bone and Stem Cells, NanjingMedical University, Nanjing, China.(2)Department of Breast Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing MedicalUniversity, Nanjing, China.(3)Calcium Research Laboratory, McGill University Health Centre and Department ofMedicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.Human epidemiological studies suggest that 1,25(OH)2 D3 deficiency might increasecancer incidence, but no spontaneous tumors have been reported in mice lacking1,25(OH)2 D3 or deficient in its receptor. In our study, we detected, for thefirst time, diverse types of spontaneous tumors in l,25(OH)2 D3 deficient micemore than 1 year of age. This was associated with increased oxidative stress,cellular senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype molecules, suchas hepatocyte growth factor, mediated via its receptor c-Met. Furthermore,1,25(OH)2 D3 prevented spontaneous tumor development. We also demonstrated thatl,25(OH)2 D3 deficiency accelerates allograft tumor initiation and growth byincreasing oxidative stress and DNA damage, activating oncogenes, inactivatingtumor suppressor genes, stimulating malignant cell proliferation and inhibitingtheir senescence; in contrast, supplementation with exogenous l,25(OH)2 D3 orantioxidant, or knock-down of the Bmi1 or c-Met oncogene, largely rescued thephenotypes of allograft tumors. Results from our study suggest that 1,25(OH)2 D3 deficiency enhances tumorigenesis by increasing malignant cell oxidative stressand DNA damage, stimulating microenvironmental cell senescence and asenescence-associated secretory phenotype, and activating oncogenes andinactivating tumor suppressor genes, thus increasing malignant cellproliferation. Our study provides direct evidence supporting the role of vitamin D deficiency in increasing cancer incidence. Conversely, 1,25(OH)2 D3 preventedspontaneous tumor development, suggesting that this inhibitory effect preventsthe initiation and progression of tumorigenesis, thus provides a mechanisticbasis for 1,25(OH)2 D3 to prevent tumorigenesis in an aging organism.Â© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31317 PMID: 29441580
