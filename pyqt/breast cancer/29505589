Because high-dose conformality can be achieved using a particlebeam, a small uncertainty can affect tumor control or cause normal-tissuecomplications. From this perspective, the treatment planning system (TPS) must beaccurate. However, there is a well-known inaccuracy regarding dose computation inheterogeneous media. This means that verifying the uncertainty level is one ofthe prerequisites for TPS commissioning. We evaluated the range accuracy of thedose computation algorithm implemented in a commercial TPS, and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation against measurement using a CT calibration phantom. A treatment planwas produced for eight different materials plugged into a phantom, andtwo-dimensional doses were measured using a chamber array. The measurement setup and beam delivery were simulated by MC code. For an infinite solid water phantom,the gamma passing rate between the measurement and TPS was 97.7%, and thatbetween the measurement and MC was 96.5%. However, gamma passing rates betweenthe measurement and TPS were 49.4% for the lung and 67.8% for bone, and betweenthe measurement and MC were 85.6% for the lung and 100.0% for bone tissue. Foradipose, breast, brain, liver, and bone mineral, the gamma passing rates computedby TPS were 91.7%, 90.6%, 81.7%, 85.6%, and 85.6%, respectively. The gammapassing rates for MC for adipose, breast, brain, liver, and bone mineral were100.0%, 97.2%, 95.0%, 98.9%, and 97.8%, respectively. In conclusion, thedescribed procedure successfully evaluated the allowable range uncertainty forTPS commissioning. The TPS dose calculation is inefficient in heterogeneous mediawith large differences in density, such as lung or bone tissue. Therefore, thelimitations of TPS in heterogeneous media should be understood and applied inclinical practice.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193904 PMCID: PMC5837130PMID: 29505589  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
