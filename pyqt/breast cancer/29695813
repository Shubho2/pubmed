Previous animal studies have shown that the use of triaza chelators for 64Cu labelling of synthetic Affibody molecules is suboptimal. In this study, wetested a hypothesis that the use of cross-bridged chelator, CB-TE2A, incombination with Gly-Glu-Glu-Glu spacer for labelling of Affibody molecules with radiocopper would improve imaging contrast. CB-TE2A was coupled to the N-terminusof synthetic Affibody molecules extended either with a glycine (designationCB-TE2A-G-ZHER2:342) or Gly-Glu-Glu-Glu spacer (CB-TE2A-GEEE-ZHER2:342).Biodistribution and targeting properties of 64Cu-CB-TE2A-G-ZHER2:342 and64Cu-CB-TE2A-GEEE-ZHER2:342 were compared in tumor-bearing mice with theproperties of 64Cu-NODAGA-ZHER2:S1, which had the best targeting properties inthe previous study. 64Cu-CB-TE2A-GEEE-ZHER2:342 provided appreciably lower uptakein normal tissues and higher tumor-to-organ ratios than 64Cu-CB-TE2A-G-ZHER2:342 and 64Cu-NODAGA-ZHER2:S1. The most pronounced was a several-fold difference inthe hepatic uptake. At the optimal time point, 6 h after injection, the tumoruptake of 64Cu-CB-TE2A-GEEE-ZHER2:342 was 16 ± 6%ID/g and tumor-to-blood ratiowas 181 ± 52. In conclusion, a combination of the cross-bridged CB-TE2A chelator and Gly-Glu-Glu-Glu spacer is preferable for radiocopper labelling of Affibodymolecules and, possibly, other scaffold proteins having high renal re-absorption.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-24785-2 PMCID: PMC5916907PMID: 29695813
