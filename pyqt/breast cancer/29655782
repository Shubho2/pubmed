Breast cancer cells are not in direct contact with thesemicrobes, but disease could be influenced by bacterial metabolites includingsecondary bile acids that are exclusively synthesized by the microbiome and knownto enter the human circulation. In murine and bench experiments, a secondary bileacid, lithocholic acid (LCA) in concentrations corresponding to its tissuereference concentrations (< 1 μM), reduced cancer cell proliferation (by 10-20%) and VEGF production (by 37%), aggressiveness and metastatic potential of primary tumors through inducing mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, increased antitumorimmune response, OXPHOS and the TCA cycle. Part of these effects was due toactivation of TGR5 by LCA. Early stage breast cancer patients, versus controlwomen, had reduced serum LCA levels, reduced chenodeoxycholic acid to LCA ratio, and reduced abundance of the baiH (7α/β-hydroxysteroid dehydroxylase, the keyenzyme in LCA generation) gene in fecal DNA, all suggesting reduced microbialgeneration of LCA in early breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
