The hyperactive metabolism of cancercells supports their extreme adaptability and plasticity and facilitatesresistance to common anticancer therapies. In spite the potential relevance of a metastasis metabolic control therapy, so far, limited experience is available in this direction. Here, we evaluated the effect of the recently describedα-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) inhibitor, (S)-2-[(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)amino] succinic acid (AA6), in an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer 4T1 andin other human breast cancer cell lines. In all conditions, AA6 altered Krebscycle causing intracellular α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) accumulation. Consequently,the activity of the α-KG-dependent epigenetic enzymes, including the DNAdemethylation ten-eleven translocation translocation hydroxylases (TETs), wasincreased. In mice, AA6 injection reduced metastasis formation and increased 5hmClevels in primary tumours. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo treatment with AA6determined an α-KG accumulation paralleled by an enhanced production of nitricoxide (NO). This epigenetically remodelled metabolic environment efficientlycounteracted the initiating steps of tumour invasion inhibiting theepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, AA6 treatment could be linked to upregulation of the NO-sensitive anti-metastatic miRNA 200 familyand down-modulation of EMT-associated transcription factor Zeb1 and its CtBP1cofactor. This scenario led to a decrease of the matrix metalloproteinase 3(MMP3) and to an impairment of 4T1 aggressiveness. Overall, our data suggest thatAA6 determines an α-KG-dependent epigenetic regulation of theTET-miR200-Zeb1/CtBP1-MMP3 axis providing an anti-metastatic effect in a mousemodel of breast cancer-associated metastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0802-8 PMCID: PMC6037705PMID: 29988033
