Moreover, several cell surfacemarkers, such as CD44 and EpCAM, are molecular targets on cancer stem-like cells of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate whether catumaxomab, aclinical-grade bispecific antibody that binds to both EpCAM on tumor cells andCD3 on T-cells, combined with activated T-cells can eliminate chemoresistanttriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, a cell line (MUK-BC1) was established from humanbreast carcinoma cells derived from a patient with chemoresistant anddisseminated breast cancer. These EpCAM-positive TNBC cells were almostcompletely resistant to various drug-mediated cytotoxicities up to aconcentration of 10 μg/ml.RESULTS: Pre-treatment with catumaxomab and subsequent addition ofinterleukin-2/OKT3-activated autologous T-cells eliminated EpCAM-positive TNBCcells.CONCLUSION: Catumaxomab combined with activated T-cells may be a potenttherapeutic modality to overcome chemoresistant EpCAM-positive TNBC cells.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12724 PMID: 29970561  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
