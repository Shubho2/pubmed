The concentrations of the ligands in serum samples showedcorrelations r2 ≥ 0.84 between the single-plex and three-plex methods. Thethree-plex assay demonstrated limit of detection levels at 0.16 ng/L for AR,0.23 ng/L for BTC and 0.22 ng/L for TGF-α. Total coefficients of variations were 8.5%-31% for AR, 11%-21.8% for BTC and 12.4%-16.2% for TGF-α. Spiking experimentsshowed a mean recovery of 97% for AR, 86% for BTC and 81% for TGF-α. Theconcentrations of the EGFR ligands did not change significantly after series offreeze thaw cycles or incubation at 22 °C for up to 24 h.CONCLUSION: This robust three-plex assay with up to 40-fold increase insensitivity relative to conventional ELISA is the first published method that hasthe required sensitivity to measure AR, BTC and TGF-α simultaneously in humanblood samples.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
