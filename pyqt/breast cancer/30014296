As three leading causes of deaththat endanger women's health, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and cervical cancerare characterized by high degree of malignancy, metastasis and recurrence.Associated with women's fertility, these three malignancies are common andrepresentative among females. These years, research findings have suggested that CSCs are closely connected with many cancers (including aforementioned threemalignancies) and several processes of tumors such as their genesis anddevelopment. CSCs have become great concerns for current cancer treatment andinterventions. This paper does not only summarize roles of CSCs in genesis,development, drug resistance, metastasis and recurrence of breast cancer, ovariancancer and cervical cancer, but also proposes potential methods of treatment and intervention, in hope of inspiring readers and researchers.DOI: 10.1007/s12253-018-0448-y PMID: 30014296
