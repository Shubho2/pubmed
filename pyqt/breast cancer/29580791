We assessedassociations between (i) lesion pattern (mass vs. nonmass) and PPV; (ii) lesionpattern and suspected likelihood of cancer (low vs. moderate vs. high); (iii)background parenchymal uptake (BPU) (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous) and PPV; (iv)breast density (dense vs. non-dense) and PPV; and (v) BPU and density.RESULTS: One hundred ten of 153 patients were diagnosed with malignancy orhigh-risk pathology (PPV1 = 71.9%), and 130/193 biopsies resulted in malignant orhigh-risk lesions (PPV3 = 67.4%). Biopsies of mass vs. nonmass findings hadcomparable PPV3 (71.7% vs. 61.3%; P = .0717). Mass findings were correlated with higher suspicion for cancer than nonmass findings (P < .001). There was nosignificant difference in PPV3 when comparing biopsies from homogeneous vs.heterogeneous BPU (72.5% vs. 60.7%; P = .103). No association was found betweenpatients' BPU and diagnosed cancer or high-risk lesions (P = .513). Biopsies fromnondense breasts demonstrated higher PPV3 than biopsies from dense breasts (85.4%vs. 60.6%; P = .0025); patients with nondense breasts were more likely to bediagnosed with cancer or high-risk pathology (PPV1 = 87.8% vs. 66.0%;P = .00844). Dense breasts had a greater association with heterogeneous BPU(P = .0844).CONCLUSION: Neither variability in mass or nonmass positive MBI findings, norvariability in BPU on MBI were significant determinants for the probability ofmalignancy. Dense breasts were associated with lower predictability andheterogeneous BPU on MBI.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists. Published byElsevier Inc.
