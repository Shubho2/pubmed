The present meta-analysis examines the effects of the 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D and vitaminD intake on breast cancer risk. For this purpose, a PubMed, Scopus and Web ofScience-databases search was conducted including all papers published with thekeywords "breast cancer" and "vitamin D" with at least one reported relative risk(RR) or odds ratio (OR). In total sixty eight studies published between 1998 and 2018 were analyzed. Information about type of study, hormonal receptors andmenopausal status was retrieved. Pooled OR or RR were estimated by weightingindividual OR/RR by the inverse of their variance Our study showed a protectiveeffect between 25 (OH) D and breast cancer in both cohort studies (RR = 0.85,95%CI:0.74-0.98) and case-control studies (OR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.56-0.76). However,analyzing by menopausal status, the protective vitamin D - breast cancerassociation persisted only in the premenopausal group (OR = 0.67, 95%CI:0.49-0.92) when restricting the analysis to nested case-control studies. Nosignificant association was found for vitamin D intake or 1,25(OH)2D.CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests a protective relationship between circulatingvitamin D (measured as 25(OH) D) and breast cancer development in premenopausalwomen.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27297-1 PMCID: PMC5997996PMID: 29899554
