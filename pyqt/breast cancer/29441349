Analysis of circulatingtumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and tumor-derived exosomes,all collectively referred to as "liquid biopsies," are not only a modality tomonitor treatment efficacy, disease progression, and emerging therapy resistance mechanisms, but they also assess tumor heterogeneity and evolution in real time. We review the literature concerning the examination of ctDNA and CTC in adiagnostic setting, evaluating their prognostic, predictive, and monitoringcapabilities. We discuss the advantages and limitations of various leadingctDNA/CTC analysis technologies. Finally, guided by the results of clinicaltrials, we discuss the readiness of cell-free DNA and CTC as routine biomarkersin the context of various common types of neoplastic disease. At this moment, onecannot conclude whether or not liquid biopsy will become a mainstay in oncologypractice.DOI: 10.3389/fmed.2018.00009 PMCID: PMC5797586PMID: 29441349
