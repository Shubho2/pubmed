To identifythe differentially expressed genes and the key signaling pathways in early-onset breast cancer, we have carried out the bioinformatic analysis of an RNA arraydataset in the GEO database, GSE109169, which was acquired from early-onsetbreast cancer patient. A total of 118 differentially expressed genes inearly-onset breast cancer were significantly changed compared with that inadjacent normal tissues. Most of these genes are classified into threecategories: signaling molecule, enzyme modulator, and hydrolase. Gene ontologyterms reveal that most of these genes are involved in cellular and metabolicprocesses, biological regulation, binding and catalytic activities, and receptor regulation. Protein-protein interaction network was constructed and has twohighly enriched modules: one with up-regulated genes and the other withdown-regulated genes. The singling pathways are mainly enriched in the cellularimmune system, lipid metabolism and other types of metabolic pathways. Finally,we have plotted the Kaplan-Meier curves of two up-regulated and twodown-regulated genes for the overall survival prediction in breast cancer. These results greatly expand the current view of early-onset breast cancer and shedlight on the discovery of drug candidates and the improvement for the prognosis.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1130-7 PMID: 29644522
