The mutant p53 proteins have lost wild-type p53 activity and gained newfunctions that contribute to malignant tumor progression. Different p53 mutationscreate distinct profiles in loss of wild-type p53 activity and gain of functions.Targeting the consequences generated by the great number of p53 mutations wouldbe extremely complex. Therefore, in this study we used a workaround and tookadvantage of the fact that mutant p53 cannot bind H2AX. Using this, we developed a new approach to repress the acquisition of mutant p53 functions. We show herethat the delivery of a circular RNA circ-Ccnb1 inhibited the function of threep53 mutations. By microarray analysis and real-time PCR, we detected decreasedcirc-Ccnb1 expression levels in patients bearing breast carcinoma. Ectopicdelivery of circ-Ccnb1 inhibited tumor growth and extended mouse viability. Usingproteomics, we found that circ-Ccnb1 precipitated p53 in p53 wild-type cells, butinstead precipitated Bclaf1 in p53 mutant cells. Further experiments showed that H2AX serves as a bridge, linking the interaction of circ-Ccnb1 and wild-type p53,thus allowing Bclaf1 to bind Bcl2 resulting in cell survival. In the p53 mutantcells, circ-Ccnb1 formed a complex with H2AX and Bclaf1, resulting in theinduction of cell death. We found that this occurred in three p53 mutations.These results shed light on the possible development of new approaches to inhibitthe malignancy of p53 mutations.DOI: 10.1038/s41418-018-0115-6 PMID: 29795334
