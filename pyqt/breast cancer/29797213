Melatonin is a hormone synthesized by the pineal gland at night in theabsence of light. Levels of melatonin and the metabolite of oxidative metabolism AFMK (acetyl-N-formyl-5-methoxykynurenamine), are suggested as potentialbiomarkers of BC risk. The aims of this study were to evaluate levels ofmelatonin and AFMK in women recently diagnosed with BC, women under adjuvantchemotherapy, and night-shift nurses, and compare them with healthy women toevaluate the relation of these compounds with BC risk.METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 47 women with BC, 9 healthy women, 10 healthy night shift nurses, and 6 patients under adjuvant chemotherapy. Compound levels were measured by mass spectrometry.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that women with BC had lower levelsof melatonin compared to control group women, and even lower in night-shiftnurses and in patients under adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no significantdifference of AFMK levels between the groups. In addition to this, high levels ofmelatonin and AFMK were related to patients with metastasis, and high levels ofAFMK were related to the presence of lymph node-positive, tumor > 20 mm andpatients who sleep with light at night. Our results showed a reduction ofmelatonin levels in BC patients, suggesting a relation with the disease, and inaddition, point to the importance of melatonin supplementation in women that workat night to reduce the BC risk.DOI: 10.1007/s12020-018-1624-2 PMID: 29797213
