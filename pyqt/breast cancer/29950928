In this study, we established cisplatin (DDP) resistant TNBC cells toinvestigate the potential relationship among ETS1, IKKα/NF-κB and resistance.Methods: The sensitivity was evaluated by MTT, apoptosis analysis. Theintracellular DDP concentration difference was tested by inductively coupledplasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method. Molecular pathological mechanism of DDPresistance was explored by microarray analysis and PPI network analysis. TheETS1, NF-κB signaling change were assessed by western blot and q-PCR in vitro andvivo. The existing binds between ETS1 and the core IKKα promoter were found byluciferase assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation technique (ChIP).Results: MDA-MB-231/DDP (231/DDP) cell had a higher IC50 value of cisplatin,lower intracellular DDP concentration, and lower apoptosis ratio than MDA-MB-231 (231/wt) cell line treated with DDP. Increased ABC transporters were induced bythe activation of NF-κB pathway in 231/DDP cells. ETS1, RPL6, RBBP8, BIRC2, PIK3Aand RARS were six important genes for DDP-resistance based on PPI network andexpression validation. Protein expression of ETS1 and IKKα were significantlyup-regulated in 231/DDP cells. However, inhibition of ETS1 expression enhanceschemo-sensitivity to DDP and reversed the activation of NF-κB pathway in 231/DDP cells and subcutaneous transplantation tumor in vivo. Moreover, there is existingbinds between ETS1 and the core IKKα promoter though luciferase assay and ChIP.Conclusion: This study enables us to understand the functions of ETS1 in TNBCchemotherapy and suggests that ETS1 could be used as a novel marker of poorresponse to DDP and a potential therapeutic target for TNBC chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1186/s12935-018-0581-4 PMCID: PMC6009945PMID: 29950928
