Standardclinical and pathologic factors are routinely used to support prognosis anddecisions about adjuvant therapies. Hormone receptor and her2 status areessential for decision-making about the use of adjuvant hormonal and anti-her2therapies respectively. Genomic assays are now commercially available to aid ineither further prognostication or in refining the potential benefit of adjuvantchemotherapy. The current genomic assays all generally quantify estrogen receptorand proliferation gene sets (among others) by rna expression, although thespecific genes assayed are quite discordant. The present review focuses on thepivotal studies in which each assay attempted to demonstrate clinical utility,with an emphasis on prospective trial data for each assay, if available. Usinggenomic assays, health care providers will increasingly be able to individualize therapy or de-escalate therapy, optimizing clinic benefit while minimizingtoxicities from systemic therapies.DOI: 10.3747/co.25.3814 PMCID: PMC6001757PMID: 29910655
