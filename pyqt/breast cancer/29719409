Frequencies of somatic mutations or tumor mutationburden (TMB) were associated with immunogenicity of breast cancer. This studyaimed to predict the level of TMB in patients with breast cancer by theexpression of estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), HER-2, and Ki-67, therebyanticipating the prognosis of patients and the possible response toimmunotherapy.Patients and methods: In 53 patients with breast cancer, the 453 multigenes panelbased on NGS was used to determine the TMB value of breast cancer in thepatient's primary tumor tissues. The predicted TMB value was divided into 4groups: A (0-3.33), B (3.33-5.56), C (5.56-8.89), and D (>8.89), according to thequartile method, with group A as reference level. Logistic regression was used toanalyze the risk ratio of each molecule type, and the prediction model wasestablished. Survival probabilities by covariates were assessed usingKaplan-Meier estimator survival analysis and Cox's proportional hazards models.Results: In 53 patients, the TMB value measured by the NGS polygenic panel wasbetween 0 and 14.4/Mb. TMB distribution in 53 cases of breast cancer tissue: 18cases in A group, 22 cases in B group, 10 cases in C group, and 3 cases in Dgroup. HER-2 expression positivity was significantly associated with TMB (HER-2positive vs HER-2 negative, odds ratio [OR] =34.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]:3.711-821.689, P=0.0065). Higher TMB was distributed in the patients who wereKi-67 expression positive (>14%) than those who were Ki-67 expression negative(≤14%) (OR =0.217, 95% CI: 0.054-0.806, P=0.0242). However, no significantdifferences of TMB were found between ER-positive group and ER-negative group (OR=3.133, 95% CI: 0.124-127.687, P=0.4954) and between PR-positive group andPR-negative group in terms of TMB (OR =1.702, 95% CI: 0.162-20.335, P=0.6492).The predicted model is TMB = -1.14×ER +0.53×PR +3.55×HER-2-1.53×Ki-67+ CONSTANT(INTERCEPT). Patients with low TMB had a better disease-free survival (DFS) than those with high TMB (83 vs 59 m, P=0.002). In a multivariate analysis, high TMB(>5.56) was an independent predictive factor for decreased DFS (adjusted hazardratio [HR], 5.594; 95% CI: 1.694-18.473; P = 0.005).Conclusion: The preliminary results suggest that the level of TMB value inpatients with breast cancer can be predicted based on the expression levels ofER, PR, HER-2, and Ki-67, which may indicate the prognostic and predictive value of immunotherapy in patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S159830 PMCID: PMC5914885PMID: 29719409
