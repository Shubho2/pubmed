The process of information provision and decision-making may alsocontribute to the observed variation; the objective of the current study was togive insight in the underlying decision-making process for IBR and to determinethe effect of being informed about IBR on receiving IBR.METHODS: A total of 502 patients with IBR and 716 without IBR treated attwenty-nine hospitals were invited to complete an online questionnaire onobtained information and decision-making regarding IBR. The effect of beinginformed about IBR on receiving IBR was determined by logistic regressionanalysis.RESULTS: Responses from five hundred and ten patients (n = 229 IBR, n = 281without IBR) were analysed. Patients with IBR compared to patients withoutreconstruction showed a difference in patient, tumour, treatment (includingradiotherapy), and hospital characteristics. Patients with IBR were more ofteninformed about IBR as a treatment option (99% vs 73%), they discussed(dis)advantages more often with their physician (86% vs 68%), and they were more often involved in shared decision-making (91% vs 67%) compared to patientswithout IBR. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, corrected forconfounders, showed that being informed about IBR increased the odds forreceiving IBR fourteen times (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The positive effect of being informed about IBR on receiving IBRstresses the importance of treatment information in the decision-making processfor IBR.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
