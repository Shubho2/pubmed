Electronic address:lglou@mail.shcnc.ac.cn.Hsp90 regulates the stability of oncoproteins important in tumor development and progression, and represents a potential therapeutic target. However, all Hsp90inhibitors currently in clinical trials target Hsp90 ATPase activity and exhibit low selectivity and high toxicity. In this study, we discovered a new Hsp90inhibitor, DCZ3112, with a novel mechanism of action. DCZ3112 directly bound tothe N-terminal domain of Hsp90 and inhibited Hsp90-Cdc37 interaction withoutinhibiting ATPase activity. DCZ3112 inhibited the proliferation predominantly in HER2-positive breast cancer cells, including those resistant to the classicalHsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, which mainly targets ATPase. DCZ3112 producedsynergistic in vitro activity in inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing G1-phasearrest and apoptosis, and reducing AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Consistent withthis, DCZ3112 alone inhibited the growth of HER2-positive BT-474 xenografts, and exhibited enhanced antitumor activity when combined with the anti-HER2 antibodytrastuzumab. Importantly, DCZ3112 also significantly inhibited the growth oftrastuzumab-resistant BT-474 cells, and combined treatment retained synergisticantitumor activity. Thus, our findings show that disrupting Hsp90-Cdc37interaction may represent a promising strategy against HER2-positive breastcancer, especially those with acquired resistance to trastuzumab.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
