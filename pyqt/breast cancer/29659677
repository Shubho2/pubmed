Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel,Switzerland.(7)Candiolo Cancer Institute - FPO, IRCCS, Candiolo, Turin.(8)Department of Oncology, University of Torino, Turin, Italy.Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an oncogenic driver, and awell-established therapeutic target in breast and gastric cancers. Usingfunctional and genomic analyses of patient-derived xenografts, we previouslyshowed that a subset (approximately 5%) of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC)tumors is driven by amplification or mutation of HER2. This paper reviews therole of HER2 amplification as an oncogenic driver, a prognostic and predictivebiomarker, and a clinically actionable target in CRC, considering the specificsof HER2 testing in this tumor type. While the role of HER2 as a biomarker forprognosis in CRC remains uncertain, its relevance as a therapeutic target hasbeen established. Indeed, independent studies documented substantial clinicalbenefit in patients treated with biomarker-driven HER2-targeted therapies, withan impact on response rates and duration of response that compared favorably withimmunotherapy and other examples of precision oncology. HER2-targeted therapeuticstrategies have the potential to change the treatment paradigm for a clinicallyrelevant subgroup of metastatic CRC patients.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy100 PMCID: PMC5961091PMID: 29659677
