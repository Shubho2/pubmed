In the last decade there wasan increasing interest in the possible viral etiology of human breast cancer.Since then, many viruses have been associated with this disease (murine mammarytumor virus, MMTV; Epstein-Barr virus, EBV; and human papillomavirus, HPV).Recently, BLV has been identified in human breast cancers giving rise to thehypothesis that it could be one of the causative agents of this condition. BLV isa retrovirus distributed worldwide that affects cattle, causing lymphosarcoma in a small proportion of infected animals. Because of its similarity with humanretroviruses like HTLV and HIV, BLV was assumed to also be involved in tumoremergence. Based on this assumption, studies were focused on the possible role ofBLV in human breast cancer development. We present a compilation of the currentknowledge on the subject and some prospective analysis that is required to fully end this controversy.DOI: 10.1007/s10911-018-9397-z PMID: 29777406
