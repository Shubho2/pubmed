Studies have shown that when metalloestrogens bind to the ER,there is an increase in transcription and expression of estrogen-regulated genes,which induces proliferation of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Methylmercury(MeHg), a metalloestrogen, is present in the environment and is toxic at moderateto high concentrations. However, at lower concentrations MeHg may promote theproliferation of ER-positive breast cancers and protect cells againstpro-apoptotic signals.Objective: To investigate the effects of MeHg treatment on breast cancer cells invitro.Materials and methods: MCF7 breast cancer cells were treated with concentrations of MeHg ranging from 1 nM to 100 mM. Hg analysis was used to quantifyintracellular mercury concentrations. Cell proliferation and apoptosis weredetermined by cell counting and Annexin-V staining, respectively.Results: We defined a protocol that maximizes cellular exposure to mercury.Treatment of human ER-positive breast cancer cells with 1 nM MeHg promotedproliferation, while treatment with a concentration of 100 nM induced apoptosis.Discussion and conclusions: Clarifying the effects of MeHg on breast cancer will improve our understanding of how environmental toxins affect tumor progressionand may lead to the development of future therapeutic strategies.DOI: 10.1016/j.toxrep.2018.05.002 PMCID: PMC5984200PMID: 29868453
