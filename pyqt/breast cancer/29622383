The aim of this study was to evaluate theeffect of core needle biopsy (CNB) tumor size on final pT stage.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our information system was searched to identify allpatients who underwent excisional procedures for invasive breast carcinoma fromJanuary 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The tumor size on CNB and final excision,the number of cases in which the CNB size was larger, and the percentage of casesin which using the CNB tumor size changed the final pT stage were recorded.RESULTS: From 1380 primary breast excisions/mastectomies, a total of 870 caseswere included. In 82 (9.4%) the CNB tumor size was larger (63 of 82 cases) or no residual tumor was identified on excision (19 of 82 cases). From these 82 cases, 40 (48.7%) were properly staged on the basis of CNB tumor size, 16 (19.5%) werenot staged, and 26 (31.7%) were staged using the final excision tumor size.Change in stage occurred in 7 of these 26 patients.CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that in most cases, the largest tumor size isfound in the excision/mastectomy specimen. However, in 9.4% (82 of 870), the CNB contains the most accurate tumor size for pT staging. On the basis of ourresults, including the largest linear tumor extent on the CNB report isrecommended.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
