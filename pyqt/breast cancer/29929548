Limited data in the metastatic settingare available.METHODS: Secondary lesions from 94 BC patients, 43 triple-negative (TN) and 51HER2-positive, were evaluated for TILs and expression of CD8, FOXP3, and PD-L1 byimmunohistochemistry.RESULTS: TILs levels on metastasis were generally low (median 5%) and did notdiffer between TN and HER2+ tumors. Younger patients showed significantly lowerTILs (p = 0.002). In HER2+ patients, TILs were higher in lung metastases ascompared to other sites (p = 0.038). TILs composition was different acrossmetastatic sites: skin metastases presented higher FOXP3 (p = 0.002) and lowerCD8/FOXP3 ratio (p = 0.032). Patients treated for metastatic BC prior to biopsyhad lower CD8 (overall: p = 0.005, HER2+: p = 0.011, TN: p = 0.075). In TNpatients, median overall survival (OS) was 11.8 and 62.9 months for patients withlow and high TILs, respectively (HR 0.29, 95%CI 0.11-0.76, log-rank p = 0.008).CD8/FOXP3 ratio was also prognostic in TN patients (median OS 8.0, 13.2, and54.0 months in 1st, 2nd and 3th tertile, log-rank p = 0.019). Both TILs andCD8/FOXP3 ratio were independent factors at multivariate analysis.Counterintuitively, in HER2+ BC, low TILs tumors showed better prognosis (median OS 53.7 vs 39.9 months in TILs low and TILs high, not statistically significant).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the relevance of TILs as prognostic biomarker for TNBC even in the advanced setting and provide novel hypothesis-generatingdata on potential sources of immune heterogeneity of metastatic BC.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1003-1 PMCID: PMC6013851PMID: 29929548
