HIP was implemented to merge the schedule ofonce-daily breast hypofractionation with partial breast treatment.METHODS: We identified 38 breast cancers in 37 patients from 2013 to 2014 treatedat our institution with HIP following lumpectomy for early stage breast cancer.Patients received a hypo-fractionated course (≤ 20 fractions) of once dailyradiation to the partial breast (lumpectomy cavity + margin) utilizing DIBHregardless of laterality. Clinical and treatment-related characteristics wereobtained, including target volume and organ at risk (OAR) dosimetriccharacteristics. Patients were followed clinically and with at least yearlymammograms for up to 36 months (range 5-36 months). Acute and late toxicity wasscored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03.RESULTS: Patients received a median dose of 42.56 Gy in 16 Fractions (Fx) (range 40.05-53.2 Gy; and 15-20 Fx). OAR doses were low, with a mean heart dose of0.37 Gy, an ipsilateral lung V20 mean of 4%, and a contralateral lung V5 of 1%.Acute toxicity (≤ grade 2) was present in 79% (n = 30) of the cases, withdermatitis being the most common finding (63%). Late grade 1-2 toxicity waspresent in 42% (n = 16) of the cases, with hyperpigmentation being the mostcommon finding (n = 9). There were no severe acute or late toxicities (≥ grade3). At a median follow up of 21 months, there were no local, regional, or distantfailures.CONCLUSIONS: We report limited toxicity in this low risk cohort of patients with early stage breast cancer treated with HIP, a unique and logical combination of3-D conformal external beam radiotherapy, moderate hypo-fractionation, and DIBH.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-1079-x PMCID: PMC6064058PMID: 30053864
