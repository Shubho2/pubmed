[Epub ahead of print]Breast Implant-Associated Bilateral B-Cell Lymphoma.Chen V(1), Hoang D(1), Clancy S(1).Author information: (1)Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Keck School of Medicine,University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.Lymphomas associated with implants are predominantly of T-cell type-withanaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) being most reported. That said, to date 6cases of B-cell lymphoma associated with breast implants have been reported. All cases exhibited unilateral breast involvement. Here, the authors report a case oflow-grade B-cell lymphoma occurring bilaterally in a 34-year-old woman with ahistory of Poly Implant Prosthese silicone implants at age 20, T-cellangioimmunoblastic lymphoma, and subsequent myeloablative double cord bloodtransplantation. Lymphoma cells were positive for CD20, CD5, BCL-2, CD21, CD23,IgD, IgM, with very low Ki-67 of 1%. Nevertheless, cases of ALCL associated with breast implants are rare but much more documented in literature than B-celllymphomas associated with breast implants, as in this patient. Identification of a relationship between breast cancer and silicone is still ongoing in theliterature, with long-term clinical follow-up required. More research will benecessary to fully characterize the occurrence, course, and association of thisdisease with breast implants in order to properly guide diagnosis and management.DOI: 10.1093/asj/sjy093 PMID: 29635460
