Authors aimed to investigatethe diagnostic role of miRNA-17-5p, miR-155 and miRNA-222 in serum samples frombreast cancer patients (n = 80), benign breast patients (n = 40) and healthyindividuals (n = 30) using quantitative real-time PCR technique. Median levels ofinvestigated markers revealed significant increase in primary breast cancerfollowed by benign and control groups. Investigated miRNAs reported significantrelation with clinical stages and histological grading, while only miRNA-17-5pshowed significant relation with hormone receptors. When considering investigatedmiRNAs as compared to tumor marker, their sensitivities were superior over tumor markers for early diagnosis of breast cancer, detection of early stages and lowgrades breast cancer patients. In conclusion, detection of the miRNA-17-5p,miR-155 and miRNA-222 expression levels in serum samples is significant promisingmolecular markers for early breast cancer diagnosis.DOI: 10.1080/13813455.2018.1482355 PMID: 29925280
