In obesity, adipose tissue secretes additional resistin, which prompts aproinflammatory effect through its action on adenylate cyclase-associated protein1 (CAP1). Several studies have associated the RETN gene single nucleotidepolymorphism (SNP) rs1862513 (-420C<G) with serum resistin levels and breastcancer. The CAP1 gene SNP rs35749351 (missense, Arg294His), located in theextracellular domain, has not previously been studied in cancer. These two SNPs, the mRNA expression levels of the two alleles for each of the cognate genes, and the serum resistin levels were compared between patients and controls todetermine their association with breast cancer in Mexican women in this study.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 308 controls and 100 female patientswith breast cancer. SNPs were detected by PCR-RFLP from DNA isolated fromperipheral blood. Gene expression was performed with hydrolysis probes in tumortissue. Resistin levels were quantified from serum samples by ELISA.RESULTS: The RETN rs1862513CG/GG and CAP1 rs35749351GA/AA genotypes wereassociated with 1.61 and 2.193-fold increased risks of breast cancer,respectively, compared with the CC and GG genotypes. Similarly, carriers of the Gallele of rs1862513 and the A allele of rs35749351, had 1.51 and 2.217-foldincreased risks of breast cancer compared with the C and G alleles, respectively.The rs1862513GG/rs35749351AA genotype combination increased breast cancer risk bytwofold. Serum resistin levels in postmenopausal breast cancer women were higher compared with postmenopausal controls. Tissue CAP1 expression showed differences with regard to molecular subtypes and metastases.CONCLUSION: The RETN and CAP1 polymorphisms and gene expression may be potential biomarkers for breast cancer risk.DOI: 10.1089/gtmb.2017.0212 PMID: 29641286
