Evaluating drugs that havealready been proved safe for use in humans and testing them for a new indication greatly reduces the time and monetary costs involved in finding treatments forlife-threatening conditions. Here tamoxifen, a drug that is used for thetreatment of breast cancer, is investigated in a mouse model of Duchenne musculardystrophy. Tamoxifen was efficacious in countering the symptoms of the diseasewithout affecting the underlying genetic cause. Based on these results, tamoxifenhas been tested in other forms of muscle disease with success. Drug repurposingmay not only be a cost-effective manner for treating a variety of diseases, itmay also help us uncover common mechanisms between conditions that werepreviously thought to be unrelated.DOI: 10.2533/chimia.2018.238 PMID: 29720316  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
