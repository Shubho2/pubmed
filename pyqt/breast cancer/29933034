[Epub ahead of print]CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer therapy: Current practice and futureopportunities.Lynce F(1), Shajahan-Haq AN(1), Swain SM(2).Author information: (1)Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University MedicalCenter, Washington DC, USA.(2)Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University MedicalCenter, Washington DC, USA. Electronic address: Sandra.Swain@georgetown.edu.Dysregulation of the cyclin dependent kinase pathway in luminal breast cancercreates a new therapeutic opportunity for estrogen receptor positive breastcancer. Initial pan-CDK inhibitors were associated with extensive toxicities but in recent years, the development of potent specific CDK inhibitors with favorabletolerability has driven renewed interests in this class of targeted therapies.Palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib are specific CDK4/6 inhibitors that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in combinationwith endocrine therapy for women with advanced hormone receptor positive breastcancer. These three anticancer therapeutics were approved based on progressionfree survival benefit seen on phase III trials with the most common grade 3treatment-related side effects being neutropenia, fatigue, nausea and diarrhea.Except for estrogen receptor positivity, no biomarkers predictive of response to CDK4/6 inhibitors have been identified to date. Based on mechanistic insightshere described, CDK4/6 inhibitors are currently being explored in combinationwith other agents, including targeted therapies, immunotherapy and chemotherapy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
