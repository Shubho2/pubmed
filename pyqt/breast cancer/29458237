The primary endpoint was PFS.Results: There was no significant difference in PFS between the combination andmonotherapy arm (median, 6.4 months vs. 4.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.11; p=0.84). In patients with triple-negativebreast cancer (TNBC, n=90), the combination significantly improved PFS (median,4.7 months vs. 2.5 months; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.91; p=0.02). Objectiveresponse rate was numerically higher in the combination arm, though it failed to reach statistical significance (44.4% vs. 33.3%, p=0.30). Overall survival didnot differ between arms (median, 20.4 months vs. 24.0 months; p=0.63). Whilegrade 3 or 4 neutropenia was more common in the combination arm (39.6% vs 9.0%), hand-foot syndrome was more often observed in capecitabine arm. Quality of lifemeasurements in global health status was similar. However, patients in thecombination arm showed significantly worse symptom scales especially innausea/vomiting and diarrhea.Conclusion: Irinotecan plus capecitabine did not prove clinically superior tosingle-agent capecitabine in anthracycline- and taxane-pretreated HER2 negativeMBC patients. Toxicity profiles of the two groups differed but were manageable.The role of added irinotecan in patients with TNBC remains to be elucidated.DOI: 10.4143/crt.2017.562 PMID: 29458237
