Recentstudies reported that COP1 overexpression is associated with increased cellproliferation, transformation, and disease progression in a variety of cancertypes. In this study, we investigated whether COP1 regulates p53-mediated cellcycle arrest and apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines.METHODS: We downregulated COP1 expression using lentiviral particles expressingshort hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting COP1 and measured the effects of theknockdown in three different breast cancer cell lines.RESULTS: COP1 silencing resulted in p53 activation, which induced the expression of p21 and p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) expression, and reduced the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Notably, knockdown of COP1 wasassociated with cell cycle arrest during the G0/G1 phase.CONCLUSIONS: The COP1-mediated degradation of p53 regulates cancer cell growthand apoptosis. Our results indicate that COP1 regulates human breast cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. These findings suggestthat COP1 might be a promising potential target for breast cancer-related genetherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0849-5 PMID: 29516369
