Electronic address: lacoutum@mskcc.org.With increasing survival rates across all cancers, survivors represent a growing population that is frequently affected by persistent or permanent hair growthdisorders as a result of systemic therapies, radiotherapy, surgical procedures,and therapeutic transplants. These hair disorders include persistentchemotherapy-induced alopecia, persistent radiotherapy-induced alopecia,endocrine therapy-induced alopecia and hirsutism, post-surgery alopecia andlocalized hypertrichosis, alopecia attributed to therapeutic transplants, and to novel anticancer therapies. The information contained in this continuing medical education article should facilitate a better understanding on hair disorders incancer survivors, so that adequate support and therapies may be provided tocancer survivors.Copyright Â© 2018.
