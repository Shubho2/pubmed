Only the minor part of allcancer cases are caused by inborn predisposition; the absolute majority carry asporadic character based on modifiable risk factors which play a central role in cancer prevention. Amongst most promising candidates for dietary supplements are bioactive phytochemicals demonstrating strong anticancer effects. Abundantevidence has been collected for beneficial effects of flavonoids, carotenoids,phenolic acids, and organosulfur compounds affecting a number of cancer-relatedpathways. Phytochemicals may positively affect processes of cell signaling, cell cycle regulation, oxidative stress response, and inflammation. They can modulate non-coding RNAs, upregulate tumor suppressive miRNAs, and downregulate oncogenic miRNAs that synergically inhibits cancer cell growth and cancer stem cellself-renewal. Potential clinical utility of the phytochemicals is discussedproviding examples for chemoprevention against and therapy for human breastcancer. Expert recommendations are provided in the context of preventivemedicine.DOI: 10.1186/s12199-018-0724-1 PMID: 30092754
