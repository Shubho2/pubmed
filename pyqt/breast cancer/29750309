China.Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer‑associated mortality in womenworldwide. Strong evidence has suggested that Ran, which is a small GTP bindingprotein involved in the transport of RNA and protein across the nucleus, may be akey cellular protein involved in the metastatic progression of cancer. Thepresent study investigated Ran gene expression in breast cancer tissue samplesobtained from 140 patients who had undergone surgical resection for breastcancer. Western blot analysis of Ran in breast cancer tissues and paired adjacentnormal tissues showed that expression of Ran was significantly increased inbreast cancer tissues. Immunohistochemistry analyses conducted on formalin‑fixed paraffin‑embedded breast cancer tissue sections revealed that Ran expression was associated with tumor histological grade, nerve invasion and metastasis, vascularmetastasis and Ki‑67 expression (a marker of cell proliferation). Kaplan‑Meiersurvival analysis showed that increased Ran expression in patients with breastcancer was positively associated with a poor survival prognosis. Furthermore,in vitro experiments demonstrated that highly migratory MDA‑MB‑231 cancer cellstreated with Ran‑si‑RNA (si‑Ran), which knocked down expression of Ran, exhibiteddecreased motility in trans‑well migration and wound healing assays. Cell cycleanalysis of Ran knocked down MDA‑MB‑231 cells implicated Ran in cell cycle arrestand the inhibition of proliferation. Furthermore, a starvation and re‑feeding(CCK‑8) assay was performed, which indicated that Ran regulated breast cancercell proliferation. Taken together, the results provide strong in vitro evidence of the involvement of Ran in the progression of breast cancer and suggest that itcould have high potential as a therapeutic target and/or marker of disease.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8952 PMCID: PMC6059664PMID: 29750309
