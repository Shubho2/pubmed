Its expression profile is altered in various tumoursincluding that of the breast. We studied the effect of inhibiting NKP activity innon-tumorigenic breast cell line and in estrogen receptor positive and negativebreast cancer cells.METHODS: Expression and localization of NKP and downstream signaling moleculeswere determined by RT-PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. Cellproliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle stage were determined using MTT, annexin V and flow cytometry. Cell motility and invasion were determined using woundhealing and matrigel assays. Total matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) was determined by a fluorescence-based assay.RESULTS: NKP was mainly localized on the cell membrane. Its baseline expressionand activity were enhanced in breast cancer compared to the non-tumorigenicbreast cell line. Ouabain and 3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxyxanthone (TTX) treatmentsignificantly inhibited NKP activity, which significantly reduced cellproliferation, motility, invasion and pH-induced membrane blebbing. EGFstimulation induced internalization of NKP from the cell membrane to thecytoplasm. Ouabain inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of Rac/cdc42, profillin,ERK1/2 and P70S6K.CONCLUSIONS: The NKP may offer a novel therapeutic target in breast cancerpatients who have developed metastasis, aiming to improve therapeutic outcomesand enhance survival rate.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193779 PMCID: PMC5874017PMID: 29590154  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
