Triple-negativebreast cancers (TNBCs) typically have high levels of CNVs and diverse driverlesions in their genomes. Thus, there is significant interest in exploitinggenomic data to develop predictive immunotherapy biomarkers for patients withTNBC.METHODS: Whole tissue samples from 55 resected TNBCs were screened byimmunohistochemistry (IHC) for PD-1 and PD-L1 by using validated antibodies andestablished scoring methods for staining of tumor and non-tumor cells. Inparallel, we interrogated biopsies from each resection with DNA content flowcytometry and sorted the nuclei of diploid, tetraploid, and aneuploid cellpopulations. CNVs were mapped with CNV oligonucleotide arrays by using purified(>95%) tumor populations. We generated whole exome data for 12 sorted tumorsamples to increase the resolution within loci of interest and to incorporatesomatic mutations into our genomic signatures.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 staining was detected on tumor cells in 29 out of 54 (54%) evaluable cases and was associated with increased overall survival(P = 0.0024). High levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 (IHC ≥4) were present in 11 out of 54(20%) and 20 out of 54 (37%) cases with staining of PD-L1 primarily on tumorcells for 17 out of 20 (85%) cases. The latter included tumors with both high(>50) and low (<20) numbers of CNVs. Notably, homozygous deletion of PTEN (n = 6)or activating mutation in PIK3CA (n = 1) was not associated with increasedexpression of either immune checkpoint activator in TNBC. In contrast, twotreatment-naïve cases with EGFR driver amplicons had high PD-L1 tumor staining.High mutational load and predicted neoepitopes were observed in MSI+ and high CNVburden TNBCs but were not associated with high PD-L1 expression on tumor cells.Our results challenge current models of genomic-based immunotherapy signaturesyet suggest that discrete genomic lesions may complement existing biomarkers toadvance immune checkpoint therapies for patients with TNBC.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1004-0 PMCID: PMC6042255PMID: 29996881
