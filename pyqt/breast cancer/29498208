[Epub ahead of print]Outcomes of Australian patients receiving non-funded anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors for non-melanoma cancers.Tiu C(1), Wong A(1), Herschtal A(1), Mileshkin L(1).Author information: (1)Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Victoria, Australia.AIM: To characterize the outcomes of patients with nonmelanoma solid tumorsreceiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy not funded by the Australian PharmaceuticalBenefits Scheme.METHODS: Medical records of patients with metastatic nonmelanoma tumor diagnoses treated with anti-PD-1 (self-funded pembrolizumab or nivolumab through an access program) from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, at Peter MacCallum CancerCentre, were retrospectively reviewed. Events after December 31, 2016, werecensored.RESULTS: Of 47 patients identified, 27 (57%) had lung cancer. Twenty-six hadcompassionate access to nivolumab (24 lung, one renal, one gastroesophageal with possible new lung primary). Median overall survival was 5.7 months. Eleven (23%) achieved a partial response; none had complete response. Twenty (43%) had diseaseprogression on first imaging; 16 (48%) of these continued treatment beyondradiological progression, with three achieving subsequent partial responses. Ten (21%) were not re-staged mostly due to rapid deterioration or death. At 6 and 12 months, nine (20%) and two (4%) remained on treatment, respectively. Five (12%)discontinued treatment due to immune-related toxicities. Of 34 patients who died,71% received treatment within the last month of life; 38% died in an acutehospital. None of 25 patients with poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Groupperformance scores of 2-4 responded.CONCLUSION: The response rates and overall survival of patients with NSCLC, renalcarcinoma and triple negative breast cancer of good performance status receiving anti-PD-1 therapy outside of a clinical trial are consistent with clinical trial data. However, patients with poor ECOG performance status are unlikely torespond. Careful patient selection and counseling about the potential outcomes ofself-funding treatment in this setting is needed.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ajco.12867 PMID: 29498208
