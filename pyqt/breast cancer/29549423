The UGCG has beenassociated with several cancer-related processes such as maintaining cancer stem cell properties or multidrug resistance induction. The precise mechanismsunderlying these processes are unknown. Here, we investigated the molecularmechanisms occurring after UGCG overexpression in breast cancer cells. Weobserved alterations of several cellular properties such as morphologicalchanges, which enhanced proliferation and doxorubicin resistance in UGCGoverexpressing MCF-7 cells. These cellular effects seem to be mediated by analtered composition of glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs), especiallyan accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer),which leads to an activation of Akt and ERK1/2. The induction of the Akt andERK1/2 signaling pathway results in an increased gene expression of multidrugresistance protein 1 (MDR1) and anti-apoptotic genes and a decrease ofpro-apoptotic gene expression. Inhibition of the protein kinase C (PKC) andphosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) reduced MDR1 gene expression. This studydiscloses how changes in UGCG expression impact several cellular signalingpathways in breast cancer cells resulting in enhanced proliferation and multidrugresistance.DOI: 10.1007/s00018-018-2799-7 PMID: 29549423
