Studies of proteins in blood plasma, possiblyassociated with mammographic density, are well-suited as these allow large-scale analyses and might shed light on the association between breast cancer and breastdensity.METHODS: Plasma samples from 1329 women in the Swedish KARMA project, withoutprior history of breast cancer, were profiled with antibody suspension bead array(SBA) assays. Two sample sets comprising 729 and 600 women were screened by twodifferent SBAs targeting a total number of 357 proteins. Protein targets wereselected through searching the literature, for either being related to breastcancer or for being linked to the extracellular matrix. Association betweenproteins and absolute area-based breast density (AD) was assessed by quantileregression, adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI).RESULTS: Plasma profiling revealed linear association between 20 proteins and AD,concordant in the two sets of samples (p < 0.05). Plasma levels of seven proteinswere positively associated and 13 proteins negatively associated with AD. Foreleven of these proteins evidence for gene expression in breast tissue existed.Among these, ABCC11, TNFRSF10D, F11R and ERRF were positively associated with AD,and SHC1, CFLAR, ACOX2, ITGB6, RASSF1, FANCD2 and IRX5 were negatively associatedwith AD.CONCLUSIONS: Screening proteins in plasma indicates associations between breastdensity and processes of tissue homeostasis, DNA repair, cancer developmentand/or progression in breast cancer. Further validation and follow-up studies of the shortlisted protein candidates in independent cohorts will be needed to infertheir role in breast density and its progression in premenopausal andpostmenopausal women.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0940-z PMCID: PMC5813412PMID: 29444691
