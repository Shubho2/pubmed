The TPS dose calculations were verified using Thermo Luminescencedosimeters (TLD) measurements. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the plans wasgenerated in the TPS, and also tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) values were calculated using DVH data for eachtechnique. For TCP and NTCP modeling, Poisson Linear-Quadatric (PLQ) andLyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) models were used, respectively.Results: The TCPs for the chest wall, internal mammary nodes, supraclavicularnodes, and axilla for the combined photon-electron was 90%, 90%, 90%, and 65%,respectively, which was higher compared to tangential beams (up to 11%, 11%, 5%, and 5%, respectively) and the electron therapy (up to 11%, 11%, 33%, and 23%,respectively) Whereas the NTCPs of the tangential beams for ipsilateral andcontralateral lungs, heart, and chest wall-lung interface was 4%, 1%, 3%, and5.6%, respectively. These NTCP values were considerably lower than electrontherapy (up to 42%, 66%, and 40% and 30%, respectively) and combinedphoton-electron (up to 55%, 75%, 50%, and 20%, respectively) methods.Conclusion: Tangential beam is suggested for treating mastectomy patients, due tosufficient value of TCP, and also lower NTCP compared to the other techniquessuch as electron therapy and combined photon-electron.DOI: 10.4103/abr.abr_198_17 PMCID: PMC6036776PMID: 30050887
