Herceptin, a humanized antibody against HER2, is a standardtherapy in HER2-overexpressing cases. Approximately one-third of patients relapsedespite treatment. Therefore numerous studies have investigated the molecularmechanisms associated with Herceptin resistance. An interaction between HER2signalling and steroid hormone receptor signalling pathways has been previouslyinvestigated, but the effect of this relationship on Herceptin resistance hasnever been studied. The present study analysed an impact of the steroid hormone, progesterone (PG), on Herceptin-dependent cell growth inhibition. Resultsindicated that Herceptin-inhibited proliferation of breast cancer cell linesoverexpressing HER2 (BT474 and MCF/HER2) in 3D culture is abolished by PG.Furthermore, results demonstrated that PG led to the activation ofHER2/HER3-mediated signalling. Moreover, PG treatment induced a shift ofHerceptin-dependent cell cycle arrest in G1 phase towards S and G2 phases withconcomitant upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and downregulationof CDK inhibitor p27Kip1. These results demonstrate for the first time PGinvolvement in the failure of Herceptin treatment in vitro. The presentobservations suggest that cross-talk between PG- and HRG/HER2-initiatedsignalling pathways may lead to the acquisition of resistance to Herceptin inpatients with BCa.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7493 PMCID: PMC5774405PMID: 29434878
