Screening and advancements intreatments have improved survival rate of women suffering from this ailment.Novel therapeutic techniques may further reduce cancer related mortality. One of the several emerging therapeutic options is Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) that uses light activated photosensitizer (PS) inducing cell death by apoptosis and/ornecrosis. Nanotechnology has made contribution to improve photosensitizer forPDT, increasing the efficiency of therapy using gold and silver nanoparticles.Efforts have been done to develop better mechanism to improve PS and consequentlyPDT effects. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of the PDT using goldnanoparticles (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) when mixed to methyleneblue (MB) in the treatment of the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line(MDA-MB-468). The MDA-MB-468 was treated in the presence of different MBconcentrations with/without AuNPs or AgNPs. The colloidal solution of AgNPsshowed a plasmon resonance band at 411 nm in UV-visible range and a bimodal size distribution. The results of viability analysis showed that cells treated withnanoparticles exhibited higher cytotoxicity than cells treated with only MB,improving the efficiency of the treatment in the tumor cells. The cytotoxicityeffect of MB associated with AgNPs on MDA-MB-468 cell line could be related toincreased reactive oxygen species production due to the release of Ag+ ions from nanoparticles surface, suggesting that the association between FS and AgNPs haspotential as a PDT agent.Copyright © 2018.
