On further workup, she was found tohave metastatic lobular breast carcinoma causing gastric outlet obstruction,diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration after previousgastric mucosal biopsies were unremarkable. In most reported cases of gastricmetastasis from breast cancer, a diagnosis was established by mucosal biopsy.This case is an important reminder that mucosal biopsies can be negative in about20% of patients with gastric metastasis, which may lead to a delay in diagnosisand treatment. Gastroenterologists should be diligent in taking deeper biopsiesif there is a suspicion for gastric metastasis.DOI: 10.1155/2018/2820352 PMCID: PMC5925204PMID: 29850292
