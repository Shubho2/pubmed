Dev Cell. 2018 Mar 12;44(5):539-541.Macroautophagy (autophagy) is intimately linked with cell death and allows cells to evade apoptosis. This has prompted clinical trials to combine autophagyinhibitors with other drugs with the aim of increasing the likelihood of cancercells dying. However, the molecular basis for such effects is unknown. Here, wedescribe a transcriptional mechanism that connects autophagy to apoptosis. Theautophagy-regulating transcription factor, FOXO3a, is itself turned over by basalautophagy creating a potential feedback loop. Increased FOXO3a upon autophagyinhibition stimulates transcription of the pro-apoptotic BBC3/PUMA gene to cause apoptosis sensitization. This mechanism explains how autophagy inhibition cansensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy drugs and allows an autophagy inhibitor to change the action of an MDM2-targeted drug from growth inhibition to apoptosis,reducing tumor burden in vivo. Thus, a link between two processes mediated via a single transcription factor binding site in the genome can be leveraged toimprove anti-cancer therapies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
