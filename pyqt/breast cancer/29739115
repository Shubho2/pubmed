Tofind the expression of ABCG2 in lymphatic node metastasis (N1) and N0, weperformed immunofluorescence, analyzed by Confocal technology.RESULTS: Compared to adjacent normal tissues, the percentage and density ofpositive cells expressing ABCG2 in colon cancer were significantly increased. In addition, ABCG2 expression in plasma membrane was related to lymph nodemetastasis in colon cancer, which was further verified to be downregulated by2.7-fold in N1 to N0 through immunofluorescent analysis.CONCLUSIONS: ABCG2 expression in colon cancer was up-regulated, and itsexpression was decreased in the plasma membrane of colon cancer with lymphaticnode metastasis (N metastasis).PMID: 29739115
