We compared the dose distributions ofDWA, nc3D-CRT and tVMAT in 24 consecutive left-sided breast cancer patientstreated with APBI (38.5 Gy in 10 fractions). The average doses and volumes to theplanning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk, especially heart and leftanterior descending artery (LAD) were compared among DWA, nc3D-CRT and tVMAT.RESULTS: The doses and volumes to the PTVs did not differ significantly among thethree plans. For the DWA plans, the mean dose to the heart was 0.2 ± 0.1 Gy, lessthan those of the nc3D-CRT and tVMAT plans. The D2% values of the planning organ at risk volume of the LAD were 9.3 ± 10.9%, 28.2 ± 31.9% and 20.3 ± 25.7% forDWA, nc3D-CRT and tVMAT, respectively. The V20Gy and V10Gy of the ipsilaterallung for the DWA plans were also significantly lower.CONCLUSIONS: DWA allowed to find a better compromise for OAR which overlappedwith the PTV. Use of the DWA for APBI improved the dose distributions comparedwith those of nc3D-CRT and tVMAT.Copyright © 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica. Published by ElsevierLtd.
