Electronic address:krolson@buffalo.edu.The tumor specificity of JAA-F11, a novel monoclonal antibody specific for theThomsen-Friedenreich cancer antigen (TF-Ag-alpha linked), has beencomprehensively studied by in vitro immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of humantumor and normal tissue microarrays and in vivo biodistribution and imaging bymicro-positron emission tomography imaging in breast and lung tumor models inmice. The IHC analysis detailed herein is the comprehensive biological analysisof the tumor specificity of JAA-F11 antibody performed as JAA-F11 is progressing towards preclinical safety testing and clinical trials. Wide tumor reactivity of JAA-F11, relative to the matched mouse IgG3 (control), was observed in 85% of1269 cases of breast, lung, prostate, colon, bladder, and ovarian cancer.Staining on tissues from breast cancer cases was similar regardless of hormonalor Her2 status, and this is particularly important in finding a target on thecurrently untargetable triple-negative breast cancer subtype. Humanization ofJAA-F11 was recently carried out as explained in a companion paper "Humanization of JAA-F11, a Highly Specific Anti-Thomsen-Friedenreich Pancarcinoma Antibody andIn Vitro Efficacy Analysis" (Neoplasia 19: 716-733, 2017), and it was confirmedthat humanization did not affect chemical specificity. IHC studies with humanizedJAA-F11 showed similar binding to human breast tumor tissues. In vivo imaging andbiodistribution studies in a mouse syngeneic breast cancer model and in amouse-human xenograft lung cancer model with humanized 124I- JAA-F11 constructconfirmed in vitro tumor reactivity and specificity. In conclusion, the tumorreactivity of JAA-F11 supports the continued development of JAA-F11 as a targetedcancer therapeutic for multiple cancers, including those with unmet need.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
