In order toanalyze the association between XPA rs1800975 polymorphism and the risk of breastcancer, a meta-analysis was performed in the present study.METHODS: The literature search for relevant studies was conducted in PubMed,Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), andWanfang Med Online databases. The odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95%confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using fixed-effect/random-effects models by the STATA 12.0 software. The sources of heterogeneity were analyzed by subgroup analysis.RESULTS: Six case-control studies involving 5069 subjects (2338 patients and 2731healthy controls) were included in the present meta-analysis. In the pooledanalysis, no obvious association was found between XPA rs1800975 polymorphism andthe risk of breast cancer in all genetic models. However, in subgroup analysisbased on ethnicity, XPA rs1800975 polymorphism was found to be related todecreased breast cancer risk in non-Asians in the recessive model (OR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.64-1.00, P = .045). Moreover, source of control subgroup analysisdemonstrated that XPA rs1800975 polymorphism might decrease the risk of breastcancer in population-based group in the recessive model (OR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.64-1.00, P = .045).CONCLUSION: XPA rs1800975 polymorphism may decrease the risk of breast cancer in both non-Asians and population-based patients. Large sample size andwell-designed study is needed for further assessing the role of XPA polymorphism in breast cancer risk.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011276 PMCID: PMC6039675PMID: 29953005  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
