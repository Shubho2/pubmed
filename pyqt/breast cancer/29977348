Fine tuning oftreatment guidelines.Suter MB(1), Pagani O(2).Author information: (1)Oncology Unit, ASST Settelaghi, Varese, Italy.(2)Institute of Oncology and Breast Unit of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona,Switzerland.Despite breast cancer being uncommon in young women, it is still the mostfrequent cancer diagnosed in women aged 15-39 years, and the leading cause ofdeath in this age group in high-income countries, after accidents andself-injury. The present review summarizes the most recent guidelines and offers an expert perspective on the many challenges associated with treatment of youngwomen with breast cancer. We will especially focus on early breast cancer,exploring the specificities of the diagnostic process, imaging techniques,locoregional and systemic treatments, and the added value of dedicatedmultidisciplinary teams. Specific differences in adjuvant treatment betweenpremenopausal and postmenopausal women, especially regarding endocrine therapy,will be addressed in detail. Research questions and current gaps in importantfields, such as the paucity of age-specific data regarding antihuman epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (anti-HER2) therapy and gene panels such as OncotypeDXor MAMMAPRINT will be highlighted. A consistent part of this review is dedicated to the issues defining 'young women', such as fertility preservation, managinglong-term side effects of oncological treatments and genetic counselling, bydetailing current strategies and future perspectives.DOI: 10.1177/1758835918776923 PMCID: PMC6024273PMID: 29977348
