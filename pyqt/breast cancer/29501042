This study aims toinvestigate anti-tumor effects of cdtB on breast cancer development. Clostridium difficile strain was cultured and cdtB recombinant protein (rcdtB) wassynthesized. Breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, was divided into Normalcontrol, rcdtB 50, 100, 200 and 400 ng/ml group in vitro. Mice were divided into Normal control and rcdtB treatment group (400 ng/ml) in vivo.3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay wasperformed to evaluate inhibitive effects of rcdtB on cell growth. Flow cytometry and transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling(TUNEL) were employed to examine apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, respectively.Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by utilizing commercial kit. B-celllymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were examined usingwestern blot. Inflammatory response was detected using haematoxylin and eosin(HE). Erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (C-erbB-2) andcyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) were examined using immunohistochemical andimmunofluorescence assay, respectively. The results indicated that rcdtBsignificantly induced MDA-MB-231 death, inhibited growth and decreased S-phasecells compared to Normal control group (P < 0.05). rcdtB significantly inducedearly and late apoptosis, and decreased Bcl-2 levels compared to Normal controlgroup (P < 0.05). rcdtB significantly inhibited cell migration compared to Normalcontrol group (P < 0.05). rcdtB significantly inhibited tumor growth andactivated inflammation of breast cancer model compared to Normal control group(P < 0.01). rcdtB significantly reduced C-erbB-2 and Cox-2 in tumor tissuescompared to Normal control group (P < 0.01). In conclusion, rcdtB treatmentinhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis through inhibiting Bcl-2 expression,inflammatory responses, and activating C-erbB-2 and Cox-2 expression in breastcancer mouse model.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
