China.Long non-coding RNAs play crucial roles in various biological activities anddiseases. The role of long intergenic non-coding RNA01638 (linc01638) in breastcancer, especially in HER2-positive breast cancer,remains largely unknown. Inthis study, linc01638 was found to be remarkably overexpressed in HER2-positivebreast cancer cells and tissues. Suppression of linc01638 enhanced cellapoptosis, as well as inhibited the growth and invasiveness of HER2-positivebreast cancer cells in vitro and tumor progression and metastasis in vivo.Furthermore, inhibition of linc01638 by shRNA attenuated expression of DNMT1,DNMT3a, and DNMT3b,and promoted expression of BRCA1 and PTEN in HER2-positivebreast cancer cells and mouse xenograft models, indicating that linc01638promoted tumorigenesis, partly by stimulating DNMTs signaling pathway andinhibiting expression of BRCA1/PTEN in HER2-positive breast cancer. Thesefindings collectively suggest that linc01638 might be a promising biomarker andtherapeutic target for treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1568009618666180709163718 PMID: 29992881
