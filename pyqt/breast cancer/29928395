Proproteinconvertase subtilisin/kexin type 6 (PCSK6) is a proteinase that regulates theproteolytic activity of various precursor proteins as well as protein maturation.PCSK6 also influences cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration.Therefore, to investigate the effects of PCSK6 in breast cancer, human breastcancer MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with recombinant human PCSK6 in vitro.Treatment with recombinant PCSK6 significantly increased the proliferation,invasion and migration abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, PCSK6treatment reduced cell cycle arrest and prevented apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells. This provides further support for the hypothesis that PCSK6 serves a role inpromoting tumor cell proliferation. PCSK6 treatment also increased the expressionof phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and Wnt family member3A, suggesting that these pathways are activated by PCSK6. The results of thepresent study suggested that PCSK6 may promote the proliferation of breast cancerMDA-MB-231 cells by disturbing cell cycle arrest via the mitogen-activatedprotein kinase pathway. Therefore, PCSK6 may be a potential therapeutic targetfor breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8654 PMCID: PMC6006270PMID: 29928395
