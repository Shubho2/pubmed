The cancer probability from screening by mammography and conventional USwere scored using Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).Elastography was used to re-evaluate inconsistent conventional US and mammographyresults. The diagnostic performance of conventional US, mammography, and Combinedconventional clinical imaging and SWE was compared. The clinicopathologicalfeatures of all breast cancer patients with inconsistent (and consistent)conventional US and mammography findings were compared.RESULT: Finally, 147 lesions were confirmed benign and 135 were malignant. TheAUC of Combined conventional clinical imaging plus elastography imaging (0.870)was significantly higher than mammography (0.735, p < 0.001) or conventional US(0.717, p < 0.001) alone. Among the 135 breast cancers, 79 of the conventional USand mammography findings were consistent and 56 were inconsistent. Youngerage(<50y) (p = 0.035), non-invasive (p = 0.037), smaller size (p = 0.002) andnegative lymph node status (p = 0.026) were significantly associated withinconsistent findings.CONCLUSION: The added SWE in breast screening when inconsistent results frommammography and conventional US occurred is necessary and effective.DOI: 10.3233/CH-180398 PMID: 29843228
