Wehypothesized that the rate of variant reclassification likewise differs byancestry.Methods: Nonbenign variants in actionable genes were collected from consentingsubjects undergoing genetic testing at two Southern California sites fromSeptember 1996 through December 2016. Variant reclassifications were recorded as they were received, until February 2017 or reclassification to benign. Excluding duplicate variants (same ancestry, laboratory, classification), generalizedlinear models for the hereditary breast cancer genes (BRCA1/2) and other variantsinvestigated whether rate of reclassification differed for seven categories ofancestry compared with non-Hispanic European. Models took into accountlaboratory, year, gene, sex, and current classification (handled as atime-dependent covariate) and were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing.Results: Among 1483 nonbenign variants, 693 (46.7%) involved BRCA1/2. Overall,268 (18.1%) variants were reclassified at least once. Few (9.7%) reclassifiedvariants underwent a net upgrade in pathogenicity. For BRCA1/2 variants,reclassification rates varied by ancestry and increased over time, more steeplyfor ancestries with lower initial rates (African, Ashkenazi, Chinese) than forancestries whose initial rates were high (Middle Eastern) or similar tonon-Hispanic European (non-Chinese Asian, Native American, Hispanic). Incontrast, reclassification rates of non-BRCA1/2 variants did not vary over timebut were elevated for most minority ancestries except non-Chinese Asian andNative American.Conclusions: For nonbenign variants in cancer-related genes, the rates at whichreclassifications are issued vary by ancestry in ways that differ between BRCA1/2and other genes.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy027 PMID: 29618041
