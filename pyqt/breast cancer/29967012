Here, we ask whether BC200 RNA becomes detectable inperipheral blood of patients with invasive breast cancer. Using quantitativereverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methodology, we observed that BC200 RNA bloodlevels were significantly elevated, in comparison with healthy subjects, inpatients with invasive breast cancer prior to tumorectomy (p=0.001) and inpatients with metastatic breast cancer (p=0.003). In patients with invasivebreast cancer who had recently undergone tumorectomy, BC200 RNA blood levels werenot distinguishable from levels in healthy subjects. However, normality analysis revealed a heterogeneous distribution of patients in this group, including asubgroup of individuals with high residual BC200 RNA blood levels. In blood from patients with invasive breast cancer, BC200 RNA was specifically detected in the mononuclear leukocyte fraction. The qRT-PCR approach is sensitive enough todetect as few as three BC200 RNA-expressing tumor cells. Our work establishes thepotential of BC200 RNA detection in blood to serve as a molecular indicator ofinvasive breast malignancy.Â© American Federation for Medical Research (unless otherwise stated in the textof the article) 2018.
