Vital status was determined throughthe national death index after ~ 18 years of follow-up (N = 237/597 breastcancer-specific/all-cause deaths). We used Cox proportional hazards regression toestimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multiplicative interaction by body mass index (BMI) was evaluated usingthe likelihood ratio test.RESULTS: Ever aspirin use was inversely associated with breast cancer-specificmortality (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.59-1.29), but positively associated with all-causemortality (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.99-1.48); the CIs included the null values. The HRs,however, were more pronounced for the highest level of duration, frequency,regularity, and timing for all-cause, but not breast cancer-specific mortality.Interactions with BMI revealed no significant heterogeneity (pinteraction = 0.37 and pinteraction = 0.36, respectively).CONCLUSION: Pre-diagnosis aspirin use was not strongly associated with mortality following breast cancer. The all-cause mortality associations, however, wereslightly stronger when we considered patterns of use.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1020-5 PMID: 29516320
