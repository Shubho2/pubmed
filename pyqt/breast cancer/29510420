Studies demonstrate that thesewomen are at increased risk for perioperative complications. A systematic review was conducted to assess the outcomes in obese women who underwent breastreconstruction following mastectomy.METHODS:  Cochrane, PUBMED, and EMBASE electronic databases were screened anddata were extracted from included studies. The clinical outcomes assessed weresurgical complications, medical complications, length of postoperative hospitalstay, reoperation rate, and patient satisfaction.RESULTS:  Out of 33 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review and 29provided enough data to be included in the meta-analysis (71,368 patients, 20,061of whom were obese). Obese women (body mass index > 30 kg/m2) were 2.29 timesmore likely to experience surgical complications (95% confidence interval (CI)2.19-2.39; p < 0.00001), 2.89 times more likely to have medical complications(95% CI 2.50-3.35; p < 0.00001), and had a 1.91 times higher risk of reoperation (95% CI 1.75-2.07; p < 0.00001). The most common complication, wound dehiscence, was 2.51 times more likely in obese women (95% CI 1.80-3.52; p < 0.00001).Sensitivity analysis confirmed that obese women were more likely to experiencesurgical complications (risk ratio 2.36, 95% CI 2.22-2.52; p < 0.00001).CONCLUSIONS:  This study provides evidence that obesity increases the risk ofcomplications in both implant-based and autologous reconstruction. Additionalprospective and observational studies are needed to determine if the weightreduction prior to reconstruction reduces the perioperative risks associated withobesity.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.DOI: 10.1055/s-0038-1627449 PMID: 29510420
