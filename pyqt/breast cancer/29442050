In this study, we constructed an aziditaxel-loaded nano drugdelivery system using human serum albumin as a carrier, and further investigated its anti-tumor effect on TNBC in vitro. An emulsion solvent evaporation methodwas employed to prepare aziditaxel-loaded human serum albumin nanoparticles(AT-NPs). Their physicochemical properties were characterized according tomorphology, particle size, zeta potential, reconstitution stability and in vitro drug release. The in vitro anti-tumor effects of AT-NPs on TNBC were evaluatedusing a 4T1 murine triple negative mammary cancer cell lines as the TNBC model.The results showed that AT-NPs could be effectively taken up by 4T1 cells in atime-dependent manner. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay showed that the IC50 of AT-NPswas 0.17 Î¼g/ml. Meanwhile, compared with AT, AT-NPs had a better ability topromote apoptosis and induce G2/M cycle arrest. On the other hand, AT-NPs hadsignificantly inhibitory effects on the 4T1 cell adhesion, migration and invasionwith the respective average inhibition ratios of 32.53%, 83.26% and 75.78%. Thus,our study revealed that AT-NPs had favorable antitumor activity in vitro andexhibited a good prospect for application in the field of TNBC therapy.DOI: 10.1691/ph.2017.6146 PMID: 29442050
