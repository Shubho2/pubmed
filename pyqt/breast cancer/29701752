The miR-223/FBXW7pathway has been reported to be a crucial clue to the mechanism ofchemoresistance in many human cancers, such as gastric cancer, breast cancer, andnon-small cell lung cancer. However, it is unclear whether similar mechanisms of doxorubicin resistance are involved in colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of thecurrent study was to evaluate the role of miR-223/FBXW7 pathway inchemosensitivity in different CRC cell lines and to investigate the relevantunderlying mechanisms. We found that high levels of FBXW7 expression wereassociated with increased doxorubicin sensitivity in different CRC cell lines,and FBXW7 was regulated by miR-223. Overexpression of miR-223 decreased FBXW7expression and the sensitivity of CRC cells to doxorubicin, while suppression of miR-223 had the opposite effect. Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT) was proved to be regulated by miR-223/FBXW7 pathway and involved in thedrug resistance. In conclusion, miR-223/FBXW7 axis regulates doxorubicinsensitivity through EMT in CRC, which may lead to the development ofindividualized treatment in clinical practice.DOI: 10.1093/abbs/gmy040 PMID: 29701752
