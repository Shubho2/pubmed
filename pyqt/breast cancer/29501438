The justificationfor this study is to show that excellent survival rates are also obtained bytreating with adjuvant hormone therapy alone, based on clinical risk assessment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive, observational and retrospective study wasperformed between 2006 and 2016 with endocrine-sensitive, HER-2 negative, nodenegative breast cancer, greater than 1cm or between 0.6 and 1cm with unfavourablefeatures. Retrospective review of health records. Mortality data of the National Registry of Deaths.RESULTS: A total of 203 patients were evaluable for survival. One hundred andtwenty-three (60.50%) were treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, 77(37.90%) with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, one (0.50%) with chemotherapyalone and 2 (1%) were not treated. The overall survival rate at 5 years was 97%(95% confidence interval [CI] 94-100). Distant recurrence-free interval was 94%(95% CI 90-98). In the subgroup of patients treated with endocrine therapy alone,overall survival and distant recurrence-free interval rates at 5 years were 98%(95% CI 95-100) and 97% (95% CI 93-100), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with endocrine-sensitive, HER-2-negative, node negativebreast cancer treated with endocrine therapy alone according to their clinicalrisk have similar survival outcomes as those treated with endocrine therapyaccording to their genomic risk.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier España, S.L.U.
