The aimof this open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II study was to determinewhether prophylactic pyridoxine could delay the onset of capecitabine-induced HFSin patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: Patients received either concomitant pyridoxine (60 mg per day;pyridoxine group), or no pyridoxine but treatment with capecitabine-containingregimens (no pyridoxine group). Study treatment was administered until thedevelopment of grade 2 or worse HFS or disease progression. The primary endpoint was the time to onset of grade 2 or worse HFS from the start of protocoltreatment.RESULTS: A total of 135 patients were randomized to the pyridoxine (n = 67) or nopyridoxine (n = 68) groups. Grade 2 or worse HFS developed in 19 of 66 patients(28.8%) versus 21 of 67 patients (31.3%) in the pyridoxine and no pyridoxinegroups, respectively. The median time to onset of grade 2 or worse HFS was 13.6and 10.6 months in the pyridoxine and no pyridoxine groups, respectively [hazard ratio = 0.75 (80% confidence interval 0.50-1.13), one-sided P = 0.18].CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic pyridoxine was not shown to have an effect on the onsetof capecitabine-associated HFS in this study.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0879-z PMID: 29948956
