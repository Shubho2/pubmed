In this study we aimed to evaluate both the nephrotoxic effects ofzoledronic acid (ZA) and the protective effects of vitamin E (Vit-E) on thisprocess under light and electron microscopy.Material and methods: A total of 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups. The first group constituted the control group. The second group was giveni.v. ZA of 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 12 weeks from the tail vein. The third group received the same dosage of ZA with an additional i.m. injection of 15 mgVit-E every week for 12 weeks. Tissues were taken 4 days after the last dose ofZA for histopathological and ultrastructural evaluation. Paller score, tubularepithelial thickness and basal membrane thickness were calculated for each group.Results: For group 2, the p-values are all < 0.001 for Paller score, epitelialthickness, and basal membrane thickness. For group 3 (ZA + Vit. E), the p-values are < 0.001 for Paller score, 0.996 for epitelial thickness, and < 0.001 basalmembrane thickness. Significant differences were also observed in ultrastructuralchanges for group 2. However, adding Vit-E to ZA administration reversed all the histopathological changes to some degree, with statistical significance.Conclusions: Administration of ZA had nephrotoxic effects on rat kidney observed under both light and electron microscopy. Concomitant administration of Vit-Esignificantly reduces toxic histopathological effects of ZA.DOI: 10.5114/aoms.2016.60227 PMCID: PMC5868662PMID: 29593813
