Thus, OSNA, basedon gene amplification without RNA purification, might be impacted by numerousfactors persisting in a sample, and thereby potentially acting as PCR inhibitors.However, neither the characteristics of breast cancers showing inhibitory effectsduring OSNA, nor any of the possible inhibitors, have as yet been identified.Inhibitory effects detected during OSNA in 72 metastatic lymph nodes and thepatients' clinicopathological features were examined. Left-over OSNA samples wereanalyzed with mass spectrometry to identify proteins possibly acting asinhibitors. Most tumors showed inhibitory effects, though to varying degrees.Large tumor, young age and high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte counts were relatedto stronger inhibitory effects. Proteome analysis revealed elevations in RPB9protein and EIF2 signaling upregulation in samples showing strong inhibitoryeffects. Tumors showing strong inhibitory effects had clinically relevantcharacteristics, including large size and extensive tumor-infiltrating lymphocyteinvolvement. Identifying inhibitors in OSNA might provide new insights intobreast cancer biology as well as advancing the current technology.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25911-w PMCID: PMC5954024PMID: 29765119
