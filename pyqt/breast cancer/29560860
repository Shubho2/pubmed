Previously, we documented both the indispensable role of theextracellular matrix (ECM) protein, laminin-111 (LN1), in the formation of normalbreast acini, and the phenotypic reversion of cancer cells to acini-likestructures in 3-dimensional (3D) gels with inhibitors of oncogenic pathways.Here, we asked how laminin (LN) proteins integrate the signaling pathwaysnecessary for morphogenesis. We report a surprising reciprocal circuitrycomprising positive players: laminin-5 (LN5), nitric oxide (NO), p53, HOXD10 and three microRNAs (miRNAs) - that are involved in the formation of mammary acini in3D. Significantly, cancer cells on either 2-dimensional (2D) or 3D andnon-malignant cells on 2D plastic do not produce NO and upregulate negativeplayers: NFκB, EIF5A2, SCA1 and MMP-9 - that disrupt the network. Introducingexogenous NO, LN5 or individual miRNAs to cancer cells reintegrates thesepathways and induces phenotypic reversion in 3D. These findings uncover theessential elements of breast epithelial architecture, where the balance betweenpositive- and negative-players leads to homeostasis.© 2017, Furuta et al.DOI: 10.7554/eLife.26148 PMCID: PMC5862529PMID: 29560860
