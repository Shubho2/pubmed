This requires co-operation between the E-cadherin-basedadhesions and the associated actin cytoskeleton. In cancer, this co-operationoften fails, predisposing cells to migration through molecular mechanisms thathave only been partially characterized. Here, we demonstrate that the actinfilament cross-linker α-actinin-1 is frequently increased in human breast cancer.In mammary epithelial cells, the increased α-actinin-1 levels promote cellmigration and induce disorganized acini-like structures in Matrigel. This isaccompanied by a major reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and theassociated E-cadherin-based adhesions. Increased expression of α-actinin-1 isparticularly noted in basal-like breast cancer cell lines, and in breast cancerpatients it associates with poor prognosis in basal-like subtypes. Downregulationof α-actinin-1 in E-cadherin expressing basal-like breast cancer cellsdemonstrate that α-actinin-1-assembled actin fibers destabilize E-cadherin-based adhesions. Taken together, these results indicate that increased α-actinin-1expression destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions, which is likely to promotethe migratory potential of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our results identifyα-actinin-1 as a candidate prognostic biomarker in basal-like breast cancer.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196986 PMCID: PMC5942811PMID: 29742177  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
