However, the current assays of CTCs' detection face serious challenges regarding specificity and sensitivity.METHODS: In this study, we developed a novel strategy that combined negativeenrichment (NE), immunocytochemistry CD45 staining and fluorescence in situhybridization (FISH) to identify, enumerate and characterize CTCs. CTCs wereidentified as DAPI+/CD45-/Chromosome multiploid. The assay was evaluated withdifferent cancer cell lines including lung, breast, esophageal and gastriccancer. And then, the developed assay was applied in cancer patients to explorethe possibility of clinical application and whether CTC number was related toclinicopathological factors.RESULTS: The average recover rate of esophageal cancer cell line Eca-109 usingnegative enrichment was higher than 80% and the multiploid cells rate of fourcancer cell lines were >96%, which demonstrate the NE-FISH platform is favorable for CTCs detection. CTCs count was significantly higher in lung cancer patientsthan healthy controls and benign lung disease with an area under ROC curve of0.905 (95% confidence interval 0.866-0.944, P < .001). Using a cutoff value of 2 CTCs, the positive rate of detecting lung, gastric, breast and esophageal cancer patients were 71.33%, 86.21%, 76.77% and 78.35%, respectively. Besides, CTCscould be detected in stage I with the positive rate of 64.15% for lung cancer,83.33% for gastric cancer, 78.95% for breast cancer and 68.18% for esophagealcancer, which may promote the early diagnose and influence the treatment decisionfor better management of those cancer in clinic.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that CTCs could be detected in diverse cancersusing the novel NE-FISH platform with high sensitivity and specificity.Therefore, analysis of CTCs with NE-FISH has a clear potential to improve themanagement of cancer patients in clinical use.Copyright © 2018.
