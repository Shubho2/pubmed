Materials and Methods In this retrospective study (from January 2015 to December 2016), the location of the breasts with respect to the reduced tube current zone was determined. With Monte Carlo simulations, patient-specific dose distributionsof chest CT scans were calculated for 50 female patients (mean age, 53.7 years ± 17.5; range, 20-80 years). The potential dose reduction with OBTCM was assessed. In addition, simulations of clinical OBTCM scans were made for 17 of the 50female patients (mean age, 43.8 years ± 17.1; range, 20-69 years). Posteriororgans in the field of view were analyzed and lifetime attributable risk (LAR) ofcancer incidence and mortality was estimated. Image quality between standard CTand OBTCM scans was compared. Results No women had all breast tissue within thereduced tube current zone. Dose reductions of 18% in the thyroid and 9% in thebreasts were observed, whereas the doses in lung, liver, and kidney were 17%,11%, and 26% higher. Overall, the LAR for cancer incidence was not significantly different between conventional and OBTCM scanning (P = .06). Image qualityimproved with OBTCM (P < .002). Conclusion The potential benefit of OBTCM to the female breast in chest CT is overestimated because of a limited reduced tubecurrent zone; despite a 9% dose reduction to the female breast, posterior organs will absorb up to 26% more radiation, resulting in no reduction inradiation-induced malignancies. © RSNA, 2018.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018170757 PMID: 29584596  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
