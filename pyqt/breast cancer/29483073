Using a healthy lifestyle index (HLI) score, we assessed the association of a combination of selected modifiable risk factors (diet, alcohol, physical activity, BMI, and smoking) with risk of invasive breast cancer in theWomen's Health Initiative (WHI). This study comprised 131,833 postmenopausalwomen, of whom 8,168 had breast cancer, who were enrolled in the WHIObservational Study or the WHI clinical trials. Cox proportional hazardsregression was used to estimate the HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for theassociation of the score with the risk of developing breast cancer overall andaccording to specific breast cancer clinicopathologic characteristics. There was a 4% reduction in the risk of breast cancer per unit increase in the HLI score.Compared with those with an HLI score in the lowest quintile level, those in the highest quintile level had 30%, 37%, and 30% lower risk for overall, ER+/PR+, andHER2+ breast cancer, respectively (HR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64-0.76; 0.63, 0.57-0.69;and 0.70; 0.55-0.90, respectively). We also observed inverse associations betweenthe score and risk of breast cancer irrespective of nodal status, tumor grade,and stage of the disease. Most individual lifestyle factors were independentlyassociated with the risk of breast cancer. Our findings support the view thatpromoting healthy lifestyle practices may be beneficial with respect to lowering risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women.
