As the number of cancer survivors increases, it is importantto support their social comeback during and after treatment.Methods: Questionnaires were distributed to breast cancer patients treated inAichi Cancer Center Hospital between June and November 2014. Responders werecategorized according to adjuvant therapy (Group A: none, Group B: endocrinetherapy, Group C: chemotherapy), or if they had advanced or recurrent breastcancer (Group D).Results: A total of 279 patients returned questionnaires (62, 79, 92 and 46patients in Groups A, B, C and D, respectively). In adjuvant treatment groups, 43patients (18.5%) quit their job during or after treatment. Most patients had quittheir jobs at the time of diagnosis (7.5%), followed by those undergoingchemotherapy (5.6%) and those at the time of operation (4.9%). Quit rate from theworkplace in which patients worked at the time of diagnosis was highest in Group C (30%), followed by Group B (20%) and Group A (13%). At the time of operation,127 patients (57%) were absent from work. In Group D, 16 patients (35%) quittheir job during treatment. Rates for patients currently working who had anxiety were 62, 30, 26 and 9% in Groups D, C, B and A, respectively.Conclusions: In adjuvant treatment groups, in which quit rate was highest at the time of diagnosis, consultation about working is necessary immediately afterdiagnosis. Patients treated most heavily had higher quit rates and experiencedmore anxiety about working.DOI: 10.1093/jjco/hyy088 PMID: 29939297
