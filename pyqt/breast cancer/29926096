Anunderstanding of the expected satisfaction and breast-related quality of lifeassociated with each type of procedure is central to the decision-making process.Objective: To determine outcomes reported by patients undergoing postmastectomybreast reconstruction using implant or autologous techniques 2 years aftersurgery.Design, Setting, and Participants: Patients were recruited from 11 centers (57plastic surgeons) across North America for the Mastectomy Reconstruction OutcomesConsortium study, a prospective, multicenter trial, from February 1, 2012, toJuly 31, 2015. Women undergoing immediate breast reconstruction using implant or autologous tissue reconstruction after mastectomy for cancer treatment orprophylaxis were eligible. Overall, 2013 women (1490 implant and 523 autologoustissue reconstruction) met the inclusion criteria. All patients included in this analysis had 2 years of follow-up.Exposures: Procedure type (ie, implant vs autologous tissue reconstruction).Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes of interest were scores on theBREAST-Q, a validated, condition-specific, patient-reported outcome instrument,which were collected prior to and at 2 years after surgery. The following 4domains of the BREAST-Q reconstruction module were evaluated: satisfaction withbreasts, psychosocial well-being, physical well-being, and sexual well-being.Responses from each scale were summed and transformed on a 0 to 100 scale, withhigher numbers representing greater satisfaction or quality of life.Results: Of the 2013 women in the study (mean [SD] age, 48.1 [10.5] years for thegroup that underwent implant-based reconstruction and 51.6 [8.7] years for thegroup that underwent autologous reconstruction), 1217 (60.5%) completedquestionnaires at 2 years after reconstruction. After controlling for baselinepatient characteristics, patients who underwent autologous reconstruction hadgreater satisfaction with their breasts (difference, 7.94; 95% CI, 5.68-10.20;P < .001), psychosocial well-being (difference, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.25-5.29;P = .002), and sexual well-being (difference, 5.53; 95% CI, 2.95-8.11; P < .001) at 2 years compared with patients who underwent implant reconstruction.Conclusions and Relevance: At 2 years, patients who underwent autologousreconstruction were more satisfied with their breasts and had greaterpsychosocial well-being and sexual well-being than did those who underwentimplant reconstruction. These findings can inform patients and their cliniciansabout expected satisfaction and quality of life outcomes of autologous vsimplant-based procedures and further support the adoption of shared decisionmaking in clinical practice.DOI: 10.1001/jamasurg.2018.1677 PMID: 29926096
