Body mass index, waistcircumference, total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-densitylipoproteins (LDL), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), triglycerides, glycatedhemoglobin, HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, lipid accumulation product (LAP), and visceraladiposity index (VAI) were assessed. Logistic regression was adjusted for bodymass index and age to quantify the association between breast cancer risk andinsulinresistance, dyslipidemias, and visceral adiposity.RESULTS: the case group had higher insulin resistance (p < 0.001), LAP (p =0.012), and VAI (p = 0.004), and lower concentrations of HDL (p = 0.024) andHOMA-β(p = 0.010) compared to the control. Insulin resistance (OR = 3.00, 95% CI:1.75-5.17, p < 0.001) and higher VAI (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.17-3.13, p = 0.01)were associated with breast cancer, whereas the highest concentration of HDLreduces the chances of cancer by 53% (95% CI: 0.32-0.86, p = 0.026). In themultivariate analysis, only LAP and VAI were associated to breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: visceral fat accumulation increases the risk of breast cancer.PMID: 29974765
