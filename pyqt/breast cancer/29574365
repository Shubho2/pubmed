Here, we present additional analyses of patient-reported HRQoL outcomes from FALCON.METHODS: Women with endocrine therapy-naïve HR+ LA/MBC were randomised 1:1 tofulvestrant (days 0, 14, 28, then every 28 d) or anastrozole (daily) untildisease progression or discontinuation. HRQoL was assessed by FACT-Bquestionnaire (TOI and FACT-B total score) at randomisation and every 12 weeksduring treatment. HRQoL data post-treatment (with or without progression) werealso collected.RESULTS: In total, 462 patients were randomised (fulvestrant, n = 230;anastrozole, n = 232). Compliance to FACT-B overall ranged from 60.0 to 97.4%.Mean change from baseline in TOI and FACT-B total score remained broadly stable(approximately ± 3 points to week 132) and was similar between arms duringtreatment. HRQoL was also maintained in FACT-B subscales. Approximately one-thirdof patients had improved TOI (≥+6 points) and FACT-B (≥+8 points) total scoresfrom baseline up to week 120 and 132, respectively, of treatment with fulvestrant(ranges 26.4-45.0% and 22.4-35.8%, respectively) and anastrozole (ranges18.6-32.9%, and 22.7-37.9%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Mean change from baseline in TOI and FACT-B total score wasmaintained for fulvestrant and anastrozole; similar proportions of patients inboth arms had improved TOI and FACT-B total scores.
