A previous study showed that a plasma telomeric cfDNA level decreases in sporadic breastcancer patients compared to controls. Tumor suppressor gene products includingBRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1&2) play an important role in telomere maintenance. In thisstudy, we hypothesized that the plasma telomeric cfDNA level is associated withthe mutation status of BRCA1&2 genes. To test this hypothesis, we performedplasma telomeric cfDNA quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based assays to compare 28 womencarriers of the BRCA1&2 mutation with age-matched controls of 28 healthy women.The results showed that the plasma telomeric cfDNA level was lower in unaffected BRCA1&2 mutation carriers than in age-matched controls from non-obese women (BMI < 30), while there was no association between unaffected BRCA1&2 mutationcarriers and age-matched controls in obese women (BMI > 30). Moreover, the plasmatelomeric cfDNA level applied aptly to the Tyrer-Cuzick model in non-obese women.These findings suggest that circulating cfDNA may detect dysfunctional telomeres derived from cells with BRCA1&2 mutations and, therefore, its level is associatedwith breast cancer susceptibility. This pilot study warrants furtherinvestigation to elucidate the implication of plasma telomeric cfDNA levels inrelation to cancer and obesity.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23767 PMCID: PMC5790533PMID: 29423116
