However, its expression pattern and function in papillarythyroid cancer (PTC) are unknown. This study aimed to identify the clinical,biological, and mechanistic impacts of INAVA on PTC.Methods: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, real time PCR, andimmunohistochemistry, the expression of INAVA in PTC was analyzed. Gain- andloss-of-function assays were performed to investigate the role of INAVA in PTCcell invasion, migration, and metastasis. We explored the molecular mechanismsunderlying the roles of INAVA in PTC cells using transcriptome resequencing, realtime PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.Results: We found that INAVA expression was significantly upregulated in PTC and was significantly associated with lymph nodeÂ metastasis. Loss- andgain-of-function experiments demonstrated that INAVA promoted the aggressivephenotype of PTC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic study suggested thatupregulation of INAVA resulted in elevated fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1),which in turn increased the expression level of matrix metalloproteinases 9(MMP9). We further identified that the level of INAVA was positively correlatedwith the levels of FGF1 and MMP9 in clinical PTC specimens.Conclusion: These data establish a novel role for INAVA in promoting PTCprogression and suggest that INAVA may represent a therapeutic target for thedisease.DOI: 10.1186/s13578-018-0224-4 PMCID: PMC5887255PMID: 29632659
