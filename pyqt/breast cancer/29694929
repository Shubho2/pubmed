Epub 2018 Apr 14.3-Acetyl-8-methoxy-2[H]-chromen-2-one derived Schiff bases as potentantiproliferative agents: Insight into the influence of 4(N)-substituents on the in vitro biological activity.Kalaiarasi G(1), Rex Jeya Rajkumar S(2), Aswini G(1), Dharani S(1), FronczekFR(3), Prabhakaran R(4).Author information: (1)Department of Chemistry, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore 641 046, India.(2)Department of Biosciences and Technology, Karunya University, Coimbatore 641114, India.(3)Department of Chemistry, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803,USA.(4)Department of Chemistry, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore 641 046, India.Electronic address: rpnchemist@gmail.com.A series of 3-acetyl-8-methoxycoumarin appended thiosemicarbazones (1-4) wasprepared from the reaction of 3-acetyl-8-methoxycoumarin with 4(N)-substitutedthiosemicarbazides in a view of ascertaining their biological properties with thechange of N-terminal substitution in the thiosemicarbazide moiety. Comprehensive characterization was brought about by various spectral and analytical methods.The molecular structures of all the compounds were determined by single crystalX-ray diffraction analysis. Binding studies with Calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) andproteins such as Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and Human Serum Albumin (HSA)indicated an intercalative mode of binding with DNA and static quenchingmechanism with proteins. The compounds cleaved plasmid DNA (pBR322) and actedwell as free radical scavengers. A good spectrum of antimicrobial activity wasobserved against four bacterial and five fungal pathogens. The compoundsexhibited profound antiproliferative activity on MCF-7 (human breast cancer) and A549 (human lung carcinoma) cell lines. Assay on human normal keratinocyte cellline HaCaT showed that the compounds were non-toxic to normal cells.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
