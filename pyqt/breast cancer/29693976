Biomarkers are important for diagnosis of HCCat an early stage. Osteopontin (OPN), a glycoprotein secreted by macrophages,osteoblasts, and T cells, is also highly expressed in a variety of tumors, suchas examples in the breast, colon, and stomach. The present study aimed tocorrelate the serum level of OPN in HCV-positive hepatocellular carcinomapatients, with OPN expression in tumor and non-tumor liver tissues in order toidentify its efficacy as a biomarker for diagnosis. Material and Methods: Out of total of 146 patients, 80 were selected for inclusion in the study. Blood samplesas well as specimens of tumor and non-tumor liver tissue were collected. Inaddition, blood samples from 20 healthy volunteers were obtained as controls.Serum OPN and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were evaluated by ELISA for HCC and controlgroups. OPN and AFP gene expression were examined by real-time PCR, afterhomogenization and DNA extraction from serum samples and liver tissues. Results: It was found that serum OPN levels were significantly higher in the HCC groupcompared to normal group (P=0.009), with a strong positive correlation with AFPexpression. However, there was no significant difference between OPN expressionin tumor and non-tumor liver tissue. Conclusion: Serum OPN is highly suggested tobe a professional candidate for HCC early diagnosis, with a diagnostic abilityand accuracy equal or higher than for AFP.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.1021 PMCID: PMC6031767PMID: 29693976
