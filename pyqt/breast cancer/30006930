In the EU FP7 program CTCTrap, we aimed tovalidate and optimize the recently introduced Diagnostic LeukApheresis (DLA) toscreen liters of blood. Here we present the results obtained from 34 metastaticcancer patients subjected to DLA in the participating institutions. 7.5 mL blood processed with CellSearch was used as 'gold standard' reference. DLAs wereobtained from 22 metastatic prostate and 12 metastatic breast cancer patients at four different institutions without any noticeable side effects. DLA samples wereprepared and processed with different analysis techniques. Processing DLA usingCellSearch resulted in a 0 - 32 fold increase in CTC yield compared to processing7.5 mL blood. Filtration of DLA through 5µm pores microsieves was accompanied by large CTC losses. Leukocyte depletion of 18mL followed by CellSearch yielded anincrease of the number of CTC but a relative decrease in yield (37%) versusCellSearch DLA. In 4 out of 7 patients with 0 CTC detected in 7.5 mL of blood,CTC were detected in DLA (range 1 - 4 CTC). The CTC obtained through DLA enables molecular characterization of the tumor. CTC enrichment technologies howeverstill need to be improved to isolate all the CTC present in the DLA. This articleis protected by copyright.
