Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated withincreased breast cancer risk and mortality from breast cancer is greater in AAWcompared to WW. Data show MetS affects health-related quality of life (HRQoL).Exercise studies report improvements in MetS, however, no study to date hasexamined HRQoL in metabolically unhealthy AAW enrolled in an exercise trial.METHODS: This report examined the effect of a 6-month, 3-arm (supervisedexercise, home-based exercise, control) randomized exercise controlled trial onHRQoL among 213 obese, metabolically unhealthy, postmenopausal AAW at high riskfor breast cancer.RESULTS: Certain baseline participant characteristics were related to baselineHRQoL dimensions. The "exercise group" (supervised group combined with thehome-based group) showed significantly greater improvement in health changescores (M = 13.6, SD = 3.1) compared to the control group (M = 0.7, SD = 4.4)(p = 0.02) over the 6-month study period. There were no significant differencesin HRQoL change scores between the 3 study groups, however, althoughnon-significant, data indicated most HRQoL change scores were more favorable inthe supervised group.CONCLUSION: While significant improvement occurred in health change scores in thecombined supervised and home-based group compared to the control group, we didnot observe any significant differences on HRQoL change scores between all three study groups. However, while non-significant, there was a trend for morefavorable HRQoL change scores in the supervised group versus the home-based andcontrol groups. Additional research is needed to further explore this topic.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.cct.2018.02.005 PMCID: PMC5871580 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29428830
