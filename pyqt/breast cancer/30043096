It is a potent therapy target and its inhibition chemosensitises solid tumours. Despiterecent advances in SK1 inhibitors synthesis and validation, their clinical safetyand chemosensitising options are not well described. In this study, we havedesigned, synthesised and tested a new specific SK1 inhibitor with a low toxicityprofile.METHODS: Field template molecular modelling was used for compound design. Leadcompounds were tested in cell and mouse cancer models.RESULTS: Field template analysis of three known SK1 inhibitors, SKI-178, 12aa andSK1-I, was performed and compound screening identified six potential new SK1inhibitors. SK1 activity assays in both cell-free and in vitro settings showedthat two compounds were effective SK1 inhibitors. Compound SK-F has potentlydecreased cancer cell viability in vitro and sensitised mouse breast tumours todocetaxel (DTX) in vivo, without significant whole-body toxicity.CONCLUSION: Through field template screening, we have identified a new SK1inhibitor, SK-F, which demonstrated antitumour activity in vitro and in vivowithout overt toxicity when combined with DTX.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4900-1 PMID: 30043096
