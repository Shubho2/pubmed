Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.BACKGROUND: Findings from a recent prospective cohort study in Californiasuggested increased risk of breast cancer associated with higher exposure tocertain carcinogenic and estrogen-disrupting hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).However, to date, no nationwide studies have evaluated these possibleassociations. Our objective was to examine the impacts of mammary carcinogen and estrogen disrupting HAPs on risk of invasive breast cancer in a nationwidecohort.METHODS: We assigned HAPs from the US Environmental Protection Agency's 2002National Air Toxics Assessment to 109,239 members of the nationwide, prospective Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII). Risk of overall invasive, estrogen receptor(ER)-positive (ER+), and ER-negative (ER-) breast cancer with increasingquartiles of exposure were assessed in time-varying multivariable proportionalhazards models, adjusted for traditional breast cancer risk factors.RESULTS: A total of 3321 invasive cases occurred (2160 ER+, 558 ER-) duringfollow-up 1989-2011. Overall, there was no consistent pattern of elevated risk ofthe HAPs with risk of breast cancer. Suggestive elevations were only seen withincreasing 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane exposures (multivariable adjusted HR ofoverall breast cancer = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.98-1.29; ER+ breast cancer HR = 1.09; 95%CI: 0.92, 1.30; ER- breast cancer HR = 1.14; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.61; each in the top exposure quartile compared to the lowest).CONCLUSIONS: Exposures to HAPs during adulthood were not consistently associated with an increased risk of overall or estrogen-receptor subtypes of invasivebreast cancer in this nationwide cohort of women.DOI: 10.1186/s12940-018-0372-3 PMCID: PMC5870204PMID: 29587753
