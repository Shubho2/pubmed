Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the HER2 protein is the most commonscreening test, thus precise and reproducible IHC-scoring is of utmostimportance. Interobserver variance still is a problem; in particular in gastriccarcinomas the reliable differentiation of IHC scores 2+ and 1+ is challenging.Herein we describe the physical basis of what we called the 'magnification rule':Different microscope objectives are employed to reproducibly subdivide thecontinuous spectrum of IHC staining intensities into distinct categories (1+, 2+,3+).METHODS: HER2-IHC was performed on 120 breast cancer biopsy specimens (n = 40 percategory). Width and color-intensity of membranous DAB chromogen precipitateswere measured by whole-slide scanning and digital morphometry. Image-analysisdata were related to semi-quantitative manual scoring according to themagnification rule and to the optical properties of the employed microscopeobjectives.RESULTS: The semi-quantitative manual HER2-IHC scores are correlated tocolor-intensity measured by image-analysis and to the width of DAB-precipitates. The mean widths ±standard deviations of precipitates were: IHC-score 1+,0.64 ± 0.1 μm; score 2+, 1.0 ± 0.23 μm; score 3+, 2.14 ± 0.4 μm. The width ofprecipitates per category matched the optical resolution of the employedmicroscope objective lenses: Approximately 0.4 μm (40×), 1.0 μm (10×) and 2.0 μm (5×).CONCLUSIONS: Perceived intensity, width of the DAB chromogen precipitate, andabsolute color-intensity determined by image-analysis are linked. Theseinterrelations form the physical basis of the 'magnification rule': 2+precipitates are too narrow to be observed with 5× microscope objectives, 1+precipitates are too narrow for 10× objectives. Thus, the rule uses the opticalresolution windows of standard diagnostic microscope objectives to derive thewidth of the DAB-precipitates. The width is in turn correlated withcolor-intensity. Hereby, the more or less subjective estimation of IHC scoresbased only on the staining-intensity is replaced by a quasi-morphometricmeasurement. The principle seems universally applicable to immunohistochemicalstainings of membrane-bound biomarkers that require an intensity-dependentscoring.DOI: 10.1186/s13000-018-0696-x PMCID: PMC5848460PMID: 29530054
