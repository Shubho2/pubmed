Neurotoxic chemotherapy drugs are known to harmperipheral nerves and cause a chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN is one of the most common adverse events associated with Paclitaxelchemotherapy and may remain present long after the termination of chemotherapy.Thus, it reduces the patients' quality of life (QoL) both during chemotherapy andonwards, and can impose a danger on breast cancer survivors due to an increasedrisk of falling and fall-related injuries.METHODS: The aim of this randomized-controlled trial (RCT) (n = 36) (IG:intervention group, n = 17) (CG: control group, n = 19) was to determine whether sensorimotor exercises have a positive effect on physical and psychologicalparameters in breast cancer patients undergoing neurotoxic chemotherapy(Paclitaxel).RESULTS: As a result, we were able to show significant improvements in posturalstability in monopedal stance [left leg 16.17 ± 3.67 vs. 21.55 ± 5.33 (p < 0.001)and right leg 15.14 ± 2.30 vs. 20.85 ± 5.05 (p < 0.001)] and in bipedal stance[T1 vs. T0, - 0.49 (IG) vs. + 1.14 (CG) p = 0.039].DISCUSSION: These results in posturography correlate with the clinicalpresentation with intervention group patients scoring significantly better on theFullerton Advanced Balance Scale [37.71 ± 2.73 vs. 34.47 ± 3.98 (p = 0.004)].Moderate strength training successfully prevented a strength loss in the IG that was remarkable in the CG (- 1.60 vs. 0.60, p = 0.029). Concerning thepsychological parameters assessed via EORTC- and MFI-questionnaires, nosignificant improvements were found.CONCLUSION: Future studies should focus on the correlation of clinical andposturometry findings and subjective QOL such as the long-term-development ofCIPN.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2686-5 PMID: 29943097  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
