Themost frequent tumor is fibroadenoma. Juvenile fibroadenoma is a rare variant offibroadenoma and is characterized by rapidly enlarging, painless, and unilateral masses occurring at ages between 10 and 18 years.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 17-year-old girl who first presented to a hospital due to aleft breast tumor.DIAGNOSES: Juvenile fibroadenoma of the left breast.INTERVENTIONS: She underwent fibroadenoma excision, but she complained of a mass that presented in her left breast 3 months after surgery. After 2 years ofobservation, the mass became tender and enlarged. We conducted a wide excision ofthe tumor. Recurrent juvenile fibroadenoma with hypercellular fibromyxoid stroma of the breast was noted.OUTCOMES: The patient is in good general condition without tumor relapses during the 4 months of follow-up.LESSONS: Recurrent fibroadenomas, particularly those of a large size with a rapidgrowth rate, in the same breast suggest a high possibility of transformation. We recommend wide tumor resection.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010765 PMCID: PMC5976346PMID: 29768365  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
