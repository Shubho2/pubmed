The aim of this study was to produce apolyclonal antibody (PAb) against recombinant human ROR1 protein to be used as a tool for investigation of ROR1 expression in human cancer tissue blocks. Theextracellular part of human ROR1 recombinant protein was expressed usingpET-28b(+) plasmid in Escherichia coli Bl21(DE3) host. The recombinant ROR1, as acandidate immunogen, was purified and injected to a New Zealand rabbit. Followed by raising the titration of antibody, polyclonal anti-ROR1 antibody was purified through affinity chromatography column. After determining the purity of PAbanti-ROR1, its specific reactivity was assessed through various assessments. Flowcytometry analysis showed that PAb anti-ROR1 specifically recognizes ROR1molecule in a number of positive and negative cell lines. Results obtained fromdetection of ROR1 in paraffin-embedded breast adenocarcinoma tissue blocks(n = 11) also demonstrated that PAb anti-ROR1 can effectively be used inimmunohistochemistry. In conclusion, the developed anti-ROR1 PAb can be used as atool for determining the prognostic value of ROR1 in histopathology of cancertissues.DOI: 10.1089/mab.2017.0059 PMID: 29474159
