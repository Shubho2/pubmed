We usedtrajectory analysis to identify groups with similar development patterns in BMIand Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between trajectorygroups and mortality, and interactions with oestrogen receptor status andsmoking. We used c-index statistics to compare the trajectory model with thesingle measure model of BMI.RESULTS: We identified three distinct trajectory groups, with a mean BMI at age20 of 19, 22 and 24 increasing to 23 (normal-to-normal), 29(normal-to-overweight) and 37 (normal-to-obese) at 50-64 years of age,respectively. Women in the normal-to-obese trajectory group experiencedsignificantly higher overall mortality than those in the normal-to-normaltrajectory group (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.21‒2.56). The association declined to anon-significant level after adjustments for clinical prognostic factors. Althoughnot significant, the same tendency was seen for breast cancer-specific mortality.The association was strongest in women with oestrogen receptor-negative tumours. Weight changes over time were not significantly different from a single BMImeasure before diagnosis to predict survival.CONCLUSION: Weight gain affects overall mortality after breast cancer butclinical prognostic factors largely eliminate the association. Using trajectoriesof weight changes did not improve the predictive value compared to a singlemeasure of BMI.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4771-5 PMID: 29637418
