An array of newN-substituted-2-(4-oxo-3-(4-sulfamoylphenyl)-3,4-dihydrobenzo[g]quinazolin-2-ylthio) acetamides 5-18 were designed and synthesized from the starting compound4-(2-mercapto-4-oxobenzo[g]quinazolin-3(4H)-yl) benzenesulfonamide 4. Thetargeted compounds were screened for their cytotoxic activity against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. The IC50 of all the compounds were in the range of0.36-40.90 µM. The percentage inhibition towards EGFR was measured and found tobe in the range of 63.00-16.90 %. The most potent compounds 5, 9, 15, 17 and 18were further screened for their activity against both EGFR and HER2 receptors.The compounds showed IC50 in the range of 0.64-1.81 µM for EGFR and 1.13-2.21 µM for HER2, in comparison to erlotinib, the reference drug. Compound 17, the mostpotent towards EGFR in this series, undergoes cell cycle analysis and was foundto arrest the cycle at the G2/M phase. Measurement of the cytotoxicity ofcompound 17 against normal breast cell line showed mild cytotoxic activity. Themost potent compounds were subjected to a single dose of 8 Gy of γ-radiation and the cytotoxicity of the tested compounds was found to increase after irradiation,thus proving the synergistic effect of γ-irradiation. Molecular docking wasadopted for all the synthesized compounds to confirm their mechanism of action.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bioorg.2018.07.015 PMID: 30041137
