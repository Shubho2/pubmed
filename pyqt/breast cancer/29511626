Published prospective andretrospective papers investigating BM and SREs in breast cancer patients innon-trial settings were identified and systematically reviewed.Results: Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Incidences of BM basedon new diagnosis, length of BM-free interval (BMFI) and number and sites of BMwere detected by 17 of 24 studies. Seven studies included in the review weresubjected to analyses of risk factors for BM. Developments of SREs regarding the occurrence ratio of total and specific SREs, SERs-free interval (SREFI) and thefirst-line therapy for SREs were observed in 16 of 24 studies. Out of 5 studies, we extracted uni- and multivariate analysis of risk factor for SREs and out of 16studies - predictors for survival in breast cancer patients with BM.Conclusions: BM and SREs are common problems in non-trial breast cancerpopulations. Patient demographics, clinical stage, tumor pathological type,molecular receptors status are significantly risk factors for incidence of BM,SREs and the survival. The unique characteristics of BM and SREs in breast cancerpatients should be taken into account in future randomized controlled trials, as to optimize individual treatment options and assure a maximally long good qualityof life.DOI: 10.1016/j.jbo.2018.01.004 PMCID: PMC5832676PMID: 29511626
