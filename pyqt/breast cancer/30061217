Thisstudy aimed to explore the possibility of using circulating precursor miRs(pre-miRs) as clinical biomarkers of recurrence in breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed miR microarray analyses of circulating miRsin blood from patients with or without recurrence of breast cancer and identifiedmiR-488-5p as a recurrence-related miR. Then, the expression levels ofpre-miR-488 or miR-488-5p were measured by RT-qPCR and the clinicopathologicaland prognostic significance of circulating pre-miR-488 was assessed in the blood of breast cancer patients.RESULTS: A positive correlation was noted between pre-miR-488 and miR-488-5pexpression in blood. In 330 cases of surgically-treated breast cancer, highexpression of circulating pre-miR-488 was an independent poor prognostic factorfor recurrence-free survival.CONCLUSION: Circulating pre-miR-488 expression could be a novel prognosticbiomarker for predicting recurrence in breast cancer patients.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12755 PMID: 30061217  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
