A nonexperimental descriptive design overtime was utilized. Participants were women who were undergoing autologousabdominal breast reconstruction for breast cancer (N = 20). Data were collectedpreoperatively and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr postsurgery. Complications weremonitored intraoperatively and up to 30 days postsurgery. Psychological stresswas measured with the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), and a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Cytokines wereassayed using the 27-plex kit with a Bio-Plex Plus. Although breast cancer isconsidered a stressor, in this sample of women, scores of the PSS, IES-R, and VASshowed that in fact these participants experienced low levels of psychologicalstress. All measured biochemical mediators in serum and wound fluid were detectedand trends were identified. IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1β,RANTES, and VEGF were present in the highest concentrations. Significant changes in levels of cytokines in wound fluid were observed in IL-1β, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6,IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-17, FGF-basic, G-CSF, MIP-1α, PDGF-bb, MIP-1β, RANTES, and TNF-α. The remaining cytokine concentrations stayed stable over time. Thesefindings suggest that although these women were not experiencing high levels ofstress, meaningful cytokine patterns were detected.DOI: 10.1097/PSN.0000000000000223 PMID: 29846337
