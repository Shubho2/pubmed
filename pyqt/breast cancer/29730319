Feasibility was evaluated bycomputing median (range) recruitment, withdrawal and adherence rates.Meta-analyses were performed to evaluate exercise safety and effects on healthoutcomes only. The influence of intervention characteristics (mode, supervision, duration and timing) on exercise outcomes were also explored.DATA SYNTHESIS: There were no differences in adverse events between exercise and usual care (risk difference: <0.01 [95% CI: -0.01, 0.01]), p=0.38). Medianrecruitment rate was 56% (1%-96%), withdrawal rate was 10% (0%-41%) and adherencerate was 82% (44%-99%). Safety and feasibility outcomes were similar,irrespective of exercise mode, supervision, duration, or timing. Effects ofexercise for quality of life, fitness, fatigue, strength, anxiety, depression,body mass index and waist circumference compared with usual care were significant(standardised mean difference range: 0.17-0.77, p<0.05).CONCLUSION: The findings support the safety, feasibility and effects of exercise for those with stage II+ breast cancer, suggesting that national andinternational exercise guidelines appear generalizable to women with local,regional and distant breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018.
