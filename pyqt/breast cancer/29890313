Electronic address: smaranda.belciug@inf.ucv.ro.(2)Royal Society of Medicine, United Kingdom.Methods based on microarrays (MA), mass spectrometry (MS), and machine learning(ML) algorithms have evolved rapidly in recent years, allowing for earlydetection of several types of cancer. A pitfall of these approaches, however, is the overfitting of data due to large number of attributes and small number ofinstances -- a phenomenon known as the 'curse of dimensionality'. A potentiallyfruitful idea to avoid this drawback is to develop algorithms that combine fastcomputation with a filtering module for the attributes. The goal of this paper isto propose a statistical strategy to initiate the hidden nodes of a single-hiddenlayer feedforward neural network (SLFN) by using both the knowledge embedded indata and a filtering mechanism for attribute relevance. In order to attest itsfeasibility, the proposed model has been tested on five publicly availablehigh-dimensional datasets: breast, lung, colon, and ovarian cancer regarding geneexpression and proteomic spectra provided by cDNA arrays, DNA microarray, and MS.The novel algorithm, called adaptive SLFN (aSLFN), has been compared with fourmajor classification algorithms: traditional ELM, radial basis function network(RBF), single-hidden layer feedforward neural network trained by backpropagation algorithm (BP-SLFN), and support vector-machine (SVM). Experimental resultsshowed that the classification performance of aSLFN is competitive with thecomparison models.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
