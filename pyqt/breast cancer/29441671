The successful conjugating of MTX onto thenanoparticles (NPs) was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetricanalysis, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer, and transmission electron microscopytechniques. The results showed that the average size was 46.82 ± 5.03 nm. Thistarget drug delivery system is dependent on the release of the MTX within thelysosomal compartment. Hemolysis assay and cytotoxicity study results on HFF-2and HEK-293 cell lines show that as prepared MNPs are biocompatible. Thecytotoxicity of void of the MTX and F-Gly-MTX NPs were compared to each other by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay of the treatedMCF-7 cell line. Enzymatic release studies exhibited the release of the MTX viapeptide bond cleavage in the presence of proteinase K. These studies specify thatthe F-Gly-MTX NPs have a very remarkable anticancer effect, for breast cancercell line. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
