A series of novel furan C-2 quinoline and 1, 2,4-triazole (FQT) coupled hybrids were designed and synthesized to evaluate fortheir DNA cleavage and cytotoxic studies.Objectives: In this work we describe the synthesis and biological evaluation offuran C-2 quinoline coupled triazoles exposed for cytotoxic and DNA cleavagestudy.Methods: The electrophoretic DNA cleavage studies on λ-DNA (Eco-RI/Hinda-IIIdouble digest) using agarose gelelectrophoresis and the cytotoxic activity werecarried out by MTT assay method.Results: The results revealed that, the molecules 7(a-o) did cleave the DNAcompletely with no trace of fragments at 100 µg concentration, on the other hand,cytotoxic assay was achieved by two different human cancer cell lines (melanomacell line-A375 and breast cancer cell line MDA-MB 231). Among the synthesizedcompounds 7a, 7b, 7c and 7k exhibited potent cytotoxic activity with IC50 values ranging from 2.9, 4.0, 7.8 and 5.1 µg/ml against A375 and 6.2, 9.5, 11.3 and 7.3 µg/ml against, MDA-MB 231, respectively.Conclusion: In synthesized compounds 7(a-o) exhibited complete DNA cleavage at100 µg/ml and the compounds 7a, 7b, 7c and 7k showed very less cytotoxic innature. The structure activity relationship revealed that, the presence ofhalogen group/atoms at para position of phenyl ring remarkably enhanced the DNAcleavage and cytotoxic activities among the synthesized compounds.DOI: 10.2174/1874104501812010060 PMCID: PMC5997846PMID: 30008962
