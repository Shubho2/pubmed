Quantitative analyses including breastboundary segmentation and calcification localization are essential steps in aComputer Aided Diagnosis system based on mammography analysis. Due to unevensignal spatial distributions of pectoral muscle and glandular tissue, plusvarious artifacts in imaging, it is still challenging to automatically analyzemammogram images with high precision. In this paper, a fully automated pipelineof mammogram image processing is proposed, which estimates skin-air boundaryusing gradient weight map, detects pectoral-breast boundary by unsupervisedpixel-wise labeling with no pre-labeled areas needed, and finally detectscalcifications inside the breast region with a novel texture filter. Experimentalresults on Mammogram Image Analysis Society database show that the proposedmethod performs breast boundary segmentation and calcification detection withhigh accuracy of 97.08% and 96.15% respectively, and slightly higher accuraciesare achieved on Full-Field Digital Mammography image datasets. Calculation ofJaccard and Dice indexes between segmented breast regions and the ground truthsare also included as comprehensive similarity evaluations, which could providevaluable support for mammogram analysis in clinic.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
