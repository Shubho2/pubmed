It has been demonstrated that the suppression or inhibition of GGCT has anantitumor effect in cancer-bearing xenograft mice. Based on these observations,GGCT is now recognized as a promising therapeutic target in various cancers. Thisreview summarizes recent advances on the mechanisms of the antitumor activity of GGCT inhibition.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19072054 PMID: 30011933
