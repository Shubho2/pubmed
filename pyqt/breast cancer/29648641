Survey data were analyzed usinglogistic regression; semi-structured interviews were transcribed and analyzedusing elements of the grounded theory method.Main Outcome Measure: Women were categorized as never having had mammography orhaving had at least one mammogram in the past.Results: From survey data, having had a Pap in the past year was associated with ever having had breast screening (odds ratio = 2.15; 95% confidence interval1.30-3.54). Compared with never-screened women, ever-screened women had betterknowledge of Mexican recommendations for the frequency of mammography screening(49.5% vs 31.7% P < 0.001). A higher percentage of never-screened women perceivedthat a mammography was a painful procedure (44.5% vs 33.8%; P < 0.001) and fearedreceiving bad news (38.4% vs 22.2%; P < 0.001) compared with ever-screened women.Women who participated in semi-structured, in-person interviews expressed a lack of knowledge about Mexican standard mammographic screening recommendations forage for starting mammography and its recommended frequency. Women insured underthe 'Opportunities' health insurance program said that they are referred toreceive Pap tests and mammography.Conclusions: Local strategies to reduce mammogram-related pain and fear of badnews should work in tandem with national programs to increase access toscreening.DOI: 10.1093/intqhc/mzy053 PMID: 29648641
