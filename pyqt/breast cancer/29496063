Accordingly, all of non-metastatic N1b PTC patients are classified asstage I or II solely according to an age-cutoff of 55 years. We hypothesized thatincorporating other lymph node (LN) factors into TNM staging system would better predict cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in N1b patients.METHODS: We enrolled 745 N1b PTC patients without distant metastasis. Alternativeprognostic LN factors and cut-off points were assessed using Cox regression andtime-dependent ROC analysis. Alternative prognostic groupings were derived based on minimal hazard differences for CSM among groups stratified by LN risk and age.We assessed accuracy of CSM prediction.RESULTS: Lateral LN ratio (LNR) >0.3 and largest LN size >3 cm were prognosticfactors for CSM. Stage II patients (eighth edition) with LN risk (lateral LNR>0.3 or largest LN size >3 cm) had a much higher CSM rate (20.9%) than those inthe same stage without LN risk (3.2%). Alternative prognostic grouping (Group 1, <55 years without LN risk; Group 2, <55 years with LN risk or ≥55 years withoutLN risk; and Group 3, ≥55 with LN risk) achieved higher proportions of varianceexplained (PVEs) for predicting CSM (10.7%) than those of the eighth edition TNM staging system (4.8%).CONCLUSIONS: The proposed grouping for N1b patients using LN risk can distinguishpatients with poor prognosis from those with good prognosis better than theeighth edition TNM staging system.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
