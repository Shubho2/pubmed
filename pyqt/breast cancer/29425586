Electronicaddress: xpchen@umac.mo.Metastasis is responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths andprevention of metastasis remains a big challenge for cancer therapy. CucurbitacinB (Cuc B) is a natural triterpenoid with potent anticancer activities while itseffect on metastasis remains unclear. In the present study, the inhibitory effectand mechanisms of Cuc B on metastasis were investigated in MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells. The cells were treated with or without Cuc B, and the cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay. The effect of Cuc B on metastasis was evaluated withwound healing, transwell, and adhesion assays. Furthermore, the adhesion ofcancer cells to endothelial cells was determined. The protein expression wasdetermined by Western blotting. Cuc B (< 100 nmol·L-1) showed no obviouscytotoxicity to MDA-MB-231 cells, but significantly inhibited migration,invasion, and adhesion to Matrigel, fibronectin, type I collagen, and endothelialcells. Cuc B dramatically inhibited the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin in dose- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, Cuc Binduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which could bereduced by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). In addition, NAC pretreatment could reverseCuc B-induced suppression of migration and adhesion, expression of FAK, butshowed no effect on paxillin expression. In summary, Cuc B suppressedROS-dependent metastasis through FAK pathway in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells,demonstrating novel mechanisms for the anticancer effects of Cuc B.Copyright © 2018 China Pharmaceutical University.
