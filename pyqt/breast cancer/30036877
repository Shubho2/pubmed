Epub 2018 Jul 23.Eribulin as a Feasible and Safe Monotherapy in a Dialytic Pretreated Woman withMetastatic Breast Cancer: A Case Report.Nettuno R, Menditto C.Eribulin, a non-taxane inhibitor of microtubule dynamics, is approved for thetreatment of metastatic breast cancer patients after progression withanthracyclines and taxanes. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, information on itsuse in dialytic patients is not available to date. This report describes the caseof a chemo-pretreated dialytic woman with lung, bone, and liver metastasis frombreast cancer, who experienced stable disease with a response < 20% with eribulinin fifth line after 3 hormonal lines and 1 chemotherapy line. This case suggests the feasibility and good tolerability of eribulin in this peculiar setting.Â© 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.DOI: 10.1159/000489064 PMID: 30036877  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
