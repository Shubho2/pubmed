Recently, histone deacetylase (HDAC)inhibitors have developed into a promising cancer treatment. However, resistance mechanism induced by HDAC inhibitors remains largely unknown. Here we report thata HDAC inhibitor, JNJ-2648158 induced transcription of XIAP by activating AP-1expression, which conferring resistance to chemotherapeutics. Our results showed that high expression of c-Fos caused by HDAC inhibitor promoted AP-1 formationduring acquired resistance towards chemo-drugs, indicating an extremely poorclinical outcome in breast cancers and liver cancers. Our study reveals a novelregulatory mechanism towards chemo-drug resistance, and suggests that XIAP mayserve as a potential therapeutic target in those chemo-resistant cancer cells.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23897 PMCID: PMC5865658PMID: 29581832
