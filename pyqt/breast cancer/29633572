Inparticular, hierarchical molecular filters, based on molecular shape similarity, structure-based pharmacophore, and molecular docking, were applied on a largechemical collection of commercial compounds to identify unexplored and patentablemicrotubule-destabilizing candidates. The herein proposed 37 novel hits, showing new molecular scaffolds (such as1,3,3a,4-tetraaza-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7a-octahydroindene or dihydropyrrolidin-2-onefused to a chromen-4-one), are provided with antiproliferative activity in the μmrange toward MCF-7 (human breast cancer lines). Importantly, there is a likelycausative relationship between cytotoxicity and the inhibition of tubulinpolymerization at the colchicine binding site, assessed through fluorescencepolymerization assays.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.DOI: 10.1111/cbdd.13200 PMID: 29633572
