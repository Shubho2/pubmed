Feature analysis was done byclassifying BSGI uptake into mass, non-mass, or focus/foci. Descriptors for mass,non-mass, or focus/foci were shape, distribution, number, and intensity. BSGIfeatures of known malignancies and lesions that were additionally found by BSGIwere correlated with mammographic breast density, histology, hormonal status, andclinical follow-up data obtained over at least 2 years.RESULTS: Among 372 breast lesions from 231 patients, 241 malignancies had beenpathologically confirmed prior to BSGI and 131 additional lesions were found onBSGI. Irregular shape was more predictive of malignancy than oval shape (p=0.004)in mass uptake. Linear/ductal distribution was more predictive of malignancy thanfocal, regional, and segmental distribution (p<0.05) in non-mass uptake.Mammographic breast density was not associated with BSGI features. The lesion to normal ratio (LNR) was higher in the postmenopausal patients than that in thepremenopausal patients (p=0.003).CONCLUSIONS: The feature analysis of radiotracer uptake in BSGI is useful inpredicting whether breast lesions are malignant or benign.KEY POINTS: • The feature analysis of BSGI uptake is useful in predictingmalignancy. • Irregular shape was predictive of malignancy in mass uptake. •Linear/ductal distribution was predictive of malignancy in non-mass uptake.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5563-3 PMID: 29948076
