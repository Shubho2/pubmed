We sought to determine the prevalence and significance of germlinecancer susceptibility gene variants in PDAC with paired somatic and survivalanalyses.METHODS: Using a customized next-generation sequencing panel, germline/somaticDNA was analyzed from 289 patients with resected PDAC ascertained withoutpreselection for high-risk features (e.g., young age, personal/family history).All identified variants were assessed for pathogenicity. Outcomes were analyzedusing multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression.RESULTS: We found that 28/289 (9.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5-13.7%)patients carried pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants, including 21(7.3%) dsDDR gene variants (3 BRCA1, 4 BRCA2, 14 other dsDDR genes [ATM, BRIP1,CHEK2, NBN, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51C]), 3 Lynch syndrome, and 4 other genes (APCp.I1307K, CDKN2A, TP53). Somatic sequencing and immunohistochemistry identifiedsecond hits in the tumor in 12/27 (44.4%) patients with germline variants (1failed sequencing). Compared with noncarriers, patients with germline dsDDR gene variants had superior overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54; 95% CI 0.30-0.99;P = 0.05).CONCLUSION: Nearly 10% of PDAC patients harbor germline variants, although themajority lack somatic second hits, the therapeutic significance of which warrantsfurther study.DOI: 10.1038/s41436-018-0009-5 PMID: 29961768
