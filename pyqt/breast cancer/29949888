The overexpression of calcium ion channels and transporter genes is seen in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Since nakedsiRNA is anionic and prone to nuclease-mediated degradation, it has limitedpermeability across the cationic cell membrane and short systemic half-life,respectively. Carbonate apatite (CA) nanoparticles were formulated,characterized, loaded with a series of siRNAs, and delivered into MCF-7 and 4T1breast cancer cells to selectively knockdown the respective calcium and magnesiumion channels and transporters. Individual knockdown of TRPC6, TRPM7, TRPM8,SLC41A1, SLC41A2, ORAI1, ORAI3, and ATP2C1 genes showed significant reduction (p < 0.001) in cell viability depending on the cancer cell type. From a variety ofcombinations of siRNAs, the combination of TRPC6, TRPM8, SLC41A2, and MAGT1siRNAs delivered via CA produced the greatest cell viability reduction, resultingin a cytotoxicity effect of 57.06 ± 3.72% (p < 0.05) and 59.83 ± 2.309% (p =0.09) in 4T1 and MCF-7 cell lines, respectively. Some of the combinations wereshown to suppress the Akt pathway in Western Blot analysis when compared to thecontrols. Therefore, CA-siRNA-facilitated gene knockdown in vitro holds a highprospect for deregulating cell proliferation and survival pathways through themodulation of Ca2+ signaling in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.3390/toxics6030034 PMID: 29949888
