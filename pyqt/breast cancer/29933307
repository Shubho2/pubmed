[Epub ahead ofprint]Impact of Comorbidity on Symptoms and Quality of Life Among Patients BeingTreated for Breast Cancer.Wu HS(1), Davis JE, Chen L.Author information: (1)Author Affiliations: Goldfarb School of Nursing at Barnes-Jewish College (Drs Wu and Davis); and Washington University in St Louis (Dr Chen), St Louis,Missouri.BACKGROUND: Cancer patients often have other noncancer medical conditions.Presence of comorbidities negatively affects cancer survival.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate comorbidity, risk factors forcomorbidity, and how comorbidity was associated with symptoms and quality of lifein patients being treated for breast cancer.METHODS: One hundred and one breast cancer chemotherapy outpatients completedthis study. Comorbid conditions, weight, height, and smoking status wereidentified by chart review. Symptoms and quality of life were self-reported usingpsychometrically sound instruments. Log-linear regression analyses with age asthe covariate examined impact of ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and smoking oncomorbidities.RESULTS: Approximately 84% of the participants had 1 or more comorbid conditions.Adjusting for age, number of comorbidities differed by BMI (P = .000); the obese group had significantly more comorbidities than the normal and overweight groups.The interaction between BMI and smoking was significant (P = .047). The obeseparticipants who smoked had significantly more comorbidities compared with those who were obese but did not smoke (P = .001). More comorbid conditions wereassociated with greater pain (P < .05) and poorer sleep quality (P < .05).Comorbidity significantly correlated with symptoms and functional aspects ofquality of life (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively). A greater number ofcomorbidities was associated with lower physical and role functioning and worsefatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, and nausea and vomiting (all P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity exerts negative impacts on symptoms and quality of life.Weight and smoking status are strong determinants of breast cancer comorbidity.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Personalized care planning, weight management, andsmoking cessation may lead to better cancer outcomes.DOI: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000623 PMID: 29933307
