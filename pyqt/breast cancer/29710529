Model mice wereadministered XHP for 2 weeks, and tumor tissues were then removed, weighed,sliced, and homogenized. Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment were isolatedby magnetic cell sorting and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.Treg cell apoptosis was detected by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. mRNAexpression levels of MEKK1, SEK1, JNK1, and AP-1 in Treg cells in the tumormicroenvironment were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and their proteinexpression levels were detected by immunofluorescence staining and western blot.RESULTS: Tumor weights were significantly lower in the XHP groups compared withthe untreated control group. The overall number of Treg cells in the tumormicroenvironment decreased while the number of apoptotic Treg cells increasedwith increasing doses of XHP. mRNA and protein expression levels of MEKK1, SEK1, JNK1, and AP-1 in Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment increased withincreasing doses of XHP.CONCLUSION: XHP might promote Treg cell apoptosis in the tumor microenvironmentand further inhibit the tumor growth of 4T1 mouse breast cancer. The mechanism ofXHP may be related to upregulation of gene and protein expression of MEKK1, SEK1,JNK1, and AP-1 in Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment.Copyright Â© 2018.
