A total of 176 tumor tissuesfrom 176 patients who had hormone receptor positive breast cancer with tamoxifen treatment were used to measure miRNA expression using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).RESULTS: The five miRNAs were all up-regulated in distant recurrence cases within5 years after surgery and during tamoxifen treatment. Kaplan-Meier survivalanalyses based on expression cut-offs determined by receiver characteristicscurves (ROC) showed that high expression of miR-134, miR-125b-5P, miRNA-30a,miR-10a-5p, and miR-222 were significantly (log-rank p-value = 0.006, p-value <0.0001, p-value < 0.0001, p-value < 0.0001, and p-value < 0.0001, respectively)associated with short relapse-free time. Our results were used to build acombined 3 miRNAs expression model. It could be used to categorize high-risksubset of patients with short relapse-free survival (AUC = 0.891,p-value < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Distant recurrence during tamoxifen treatment of hormone positivebreast cancer might be affected by tamoxifen resistance related miRNAs. Suchdistant recurrence can be predicted using miRNA measurement.DOI: 10.1080/1354750X.2018.1499131 PMID: 30010434
