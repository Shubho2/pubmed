Accepted for publication April 26, 2018.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate demographic and clinical features andpredictors of mortality in Korean patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc).METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter medical chart review in Korean patients diagnosed with SSc from 1986 to 2016 at 11 university hospitalsrepresenting each geographic area of Korea. SSc patients were defined accordingto the American College of Rheumatology preliminary classification criteria andsubtyped as limited cutaneous (lcSSc) or diffuse cutaneous (dcSSc) SSc.RESULTS: We enrolled 751 patients (female, 86.7%; mean age at diagnosis, 48.9yrs). The most common organ involvement was interstitial lung disease (52.7%),followed by gastroesophageal reflux disease (32.9%) and pulmonary arterialhypertension (13.6%). Patients with lcSSc were more common than those with dcSSc (64.8 vs 35.2%), whereas anti-Scl-70 and anticentromere antibody positivity were identified in 302 (42.5%) and 175 (25.5%) patients, respectively. In the 46(6.1%) patients who developed a malignancy, lung cancer (23.9%) was the mostcommon diagnosis, followed by gastric (13%) and breast cancer (13%). During thestudy period, 57 (7.6%) patients died, and the 5- and 10-year survival rates were94% and 87%, respectively. Increased age at diagnosis, cardiovascularinvolvement, and anti-Scl-70 antibody positivity were significant predictors ofdeath.CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations and survival rates in Korean SSc patients aresimilar to those of other populations. However, the prevalence of anti-Scl-70antibody is higher in Korean SSc patients compared with whites, while theprevalence of anticentromere antibody is lower.DOI: 10.3899/jrheum.171443 PMID: 30008455
