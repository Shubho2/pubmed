We prospectively examined surgical,demographic, and psychosocial factors associated with chronic pain 6 months afterbreast surgery.METHODS: Patients undergoing breast surgery for benign and malignant diseasepreoperatively completed validated questionnaires to assess baseline pain andpsychosocial characteristics. Pain at 6 months was quantified as the Pain Burden Index (PBI), which encompasses pain locations, severity, and frequency. Surgical type was categorized as breast-conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy, andmastectomy with reconstruction; axillary procedure was categorized as no axillarysurgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and axillary dissection. PBI wascompared between groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) orKruskal-Wallis ANOVA, and the relationship between baseline demographic andpsychosocial factors and PBI was assessed using Spearman's Rank Correlation.p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTS: PBI was variable amongst patients reporting this endpoint (n = 216) at6 months, but no difference was found between primary breast surgical types (BCS,mastectomy, and mastectomy with reconstruction) or with surgical duration.However, axillary dissection was associated with higher PBI than SLNB and noaxillary procedure (p < 0.001). Younger age (< 0.001) and higher BMI (p = 0.010),as well as higher preoperative anxiety (p = 0.017), depression (p < 0.001), andcatastrophizing scores (p = 0.005) correlated with higher 6-month PBI.CONCLUSIONS: Amongst surgical variables, only axillary dissection was associated with greater pain at 6 months after surgery. Patient characteristics that wereassociated with higher PBI included lower age and higher BMI, as well as higherbaseline anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6644-x PMID: 30014456
