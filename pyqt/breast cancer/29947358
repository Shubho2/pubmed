Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) weremeasured bilaterally at each trapezius with a manual QST algometer. PPT valueswere split, yielding low, moderate, and high pain sensitivity subgroups. Subgroupself-reported characteristics were compared using Spearman's correlation,chi-square, and one-way analysis of variance.RESULTS: Lower PPT (higher sensitivity) was associated with higher levels of paininterference and maladaptive pain cognitions. The high-sensitivity group reportedhigher pain severities, interference, and catastrophizing and lower belief ininternal locus of pain control than the low-sensitivity group.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Individualized interventions for maladaptive paincognitions before surgery may reduce pain sensitivity and the severity of chronicpain developed after surgery.DOI: 10.1188/18.ONF.483-495 PMID: 29947358
