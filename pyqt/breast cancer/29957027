CIMP-related drugs were analyzed by analysis ofvariance. Tissue-cell-drug networks were developed to predict drug response ofindividual samples.RESULTS & CONCLUSION: One hundred and thirty-six copy number gain and 142 copynumber loss cell lines were classified into CIMP-high and CIMP-low groups,meanwhile 9 and 24 CIMP-associated drugs were identified, respectively.Specially, breast invasive carcinoma samples primarily composed by HCC1419 werepredicted to be sensitive to GSK690693. The study provides guidance for drugresponse in cancer therapy through genome-wide DNA methylation.DOI: 10.2217/epi-2017-0162 PMID: 29957027
