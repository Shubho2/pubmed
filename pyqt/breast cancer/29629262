Ingrassia Hospital Palermo,Italy.(2)Emergency Room G.F. Ingrassia Hospital Palermo, Italy.(3)Department of Chemistry, University of Palermo, Italy.Free-floating thrombus in the right ventricle, associated with a massive acutepulmonary embolism (PE), is a rare phenomenon. PE is an important clinical entitywith considerable mortality despite advances in diagnosis and treatment. Theprognosis of PE depends on right ventricular dysfunction, myocardial injurymarkers, and early treatment. In this report, we present the case of a71-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer admitted to intensive care unitfor PE complicated by syncope. Although our case may seem complex because it isnot represented in the guidelines, the result was satisfactory and showed howtreatment with new anticoagulants (in this case apixaban) after massivethrombolysis of PE could be considered and included in the new guidelines.DOI: 10.4103/jcecho.jcecho_35_17 PMCID: PMC5875138PMID: 29629262
