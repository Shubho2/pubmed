Electronic address:jinwei7207@163.com.The overexpression of EGFR often occurs in TNBC, and the anti-EGFR receptorantibody cetuximab is used widely to treat metastatic cancer in the clinic.However, EGFR-targeted therapies have been developed for TNBC without clinicalsuccess. In this study, we show that impaired EGFR degradation is crucial forresistance to cetuximab, which depends on the cell surface molecule CD44. Tofurther investigate the role of CD44 in EGFR signaling and its treatmentpotential, we developed a targeting fusion protein composed of an anti-EGFR scFv generated from cetuximab and truncated protamine, called Ce-tP. CD44 siRNA can bespecifically delivered into EGFR-positive TNBC cells by Ce-tP. Efficientknockdown of CD44 and suppression of both EGFR and downstream signaling by theCe-tP/siRNA complex were observed in EGFR-positive TNBC cells. More importantly, our results also showed that targeted delivery of siRNA specific for CD44 canefficiently overcome resistance to EGFR targeting in TNBC cells both in vitro andin vivo. Overall, our results establish a new principle to achieve EGFRinhibition in TNBC and limit drug resistance.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
