Several blood-based biosourcesand biomolecules, such as cell-free DNA and RNA, proteins, circulating tumorcells, and extracellular vesicles, have been explored for molecular testdevelopment. We recently discovered the potential of tumor-educated bloodplatelets (TEP) as a noninvasive biomarker trove for RNA biomarker panels. TEPsare involved in the progression and spread of several solid tumors, and splicedTEP RNA surrogate signatures can provide specific information on the presence,location, and molecular characteristics of cancers. So far, TEP samples frompatients with different tumor types, including lung, brain, and breast cancers,have been tested, and it has been shown that TEPs from patients with cancer aredistinct from those with inflammatory and other noncancerous diseases. It remainsto be investigated how platelets are "educated," which mechanisms causeintraplatelet RNA splicing, and whether the relative contribution of specificplatelet subpopulations changes in patients with cancer. Ultimately, TEP RNA may complement currently used biosources and biomolecules employed for liquid biopsy diagnosis, potentially enhancing the detection of cancer in an early stage andfacilitating noninvasive disease monitoring.
