Immunohistochemistry was applied to detect ER,PR, and Her-2.Results: The current study findings indicated a significant correlation of 90%between CNB and SE specimens for ER expression. The correlation between CNB andSE specimens was estimated as 81% and 97.3% for PR and Her-2, respectively.Discussion: CNB can be performed confidently to determine ER and Her-2. For PR,results obtained from CNB should be considered.PMCID: PMC5835367PMID: 29531544
