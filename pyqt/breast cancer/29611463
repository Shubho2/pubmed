Furthermore, many groups have focused moreon developing novel and efficient treatment methods, such as photodynamic therapyand photothermal therapy, since both therapies have shown inspiring potential in the application of antitumor. The mentioned treatments exhibited the superiority of cooperative manner and showed the ability to compensate for the adverseeffects caused by conventional monotherapy in proposed strategies. In view of theabove descriptions, we formulated a thermosensitive drug delivery system, whichachieved the enhanced delivery of cisplatin and two photosensitizers (ICG andCe6) by dual-targeting traction. Drawing on the thin film hydration method,cisplatin and photosensitizers were encapsulated inside nanoparticles. Meanwhile,the targeting peptide cRGD and targeting molecule folate can be modified on thesurface of nanoparticles to realize the active identification of tumor cells. Themeasurements of dynamic light scattering showed that the prepared nanoparticleshad an ideal dispersibility and uniform particle size of 102.6Â nm. On the basisof the results observed from confocal laser scanning microscope, the modifiednanoparticles were more efficient endocytosed by MCF-7 cells as a contrast toSGC-7901 cells. Photothermal conversion-triggered drug release andphoto-therapies produced a significant apoptosis rate of 85.9% on MCF-7 cells.The distinguished results made it believed that the formulated delivery systemhad conducted great efforts and innovations for the realization of concisecollaboration and provided a promising strategy for the treatment of breastcancer.DOI: 10.1080/09205063.2018.1460141 PMID: 29611463
