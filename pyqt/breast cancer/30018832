We describe a caseof a 70-year-old woman with recurrent erysipelas in her left arm due to infectionwith streptococci of the mitis group. Her past medical history includeslymphoedema of the left arm secondary to lymph node dissection due to breastcancer surgery. On seven different occasions during a decade, she has presented aclinical picture of erysipelas and in three of them with Streptococcus mitisgroup bacteraemia. The results indicate that two cases were caused byStreptococcus mitis and one case was caused by Streptococcus oralis. This is, to our knowledge, the first reported cases of S. mitis and of S. oralis as thecausative agents of erysipelas.DOI: 10.1155/2018/5156085 PMCID: PMC6029475PMID: 30018832
