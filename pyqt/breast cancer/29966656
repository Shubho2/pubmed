Electronic address: liusidemed@126.com.Withaferin A (WA) is an active steroidal lactone derived from the herbal plantWithania somnifera, which exhibits antitumor activity with reactive oxygenspecies (ROS) modulating in a variety of cancer models, such as breast cancer,lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, thedirect effect and mechanism of WA on CRC cells has not been previouslydetermined. The present study investigated the anti-tumor effects of WA on CRCcells in vitro, and explored the mechanisms of action. The flow cytometry wasapplied for detecting the accumulation of ROS with the treatment of withaferin A.We performed the flow cytometry and western blot to evaluate the withaferin Ainduced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human colon cancer cells. And toverify the ROS accumulation induced mitochondrial dysfunction after the treatmentof withaferin A, fluorescence microscope and western blot were applied. WAexerted a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on HCT-116 and RKO cells. The effectwas associated with ROS-mediated cell cycle arrest and the expression ofapoptotic proteins. In addition, WA promoted ROS production and decreasedmitochondrial membrane potential accompanying with mitochondrial dysfunction.Taken together, these results strongly indicated that WA directly inhibits cellgrowth and induces apoptosis in CRC cells through ROS-mediated mitochondrialdysfunction and JNKs pathway, and WA may be a promising potential candidate fortherapeutic application of CRC.Copyright Â© 2018.
