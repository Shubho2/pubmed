We have exploited poly(A-) RNA-Seq data generatedin our lab in MCF-7 breast cancer cells to define a compilation of exoniccircRNAs more comprehensive than previously existing lists. Development of anovel computational tool, named CircHunter, allowed us to more accuratelycharacterize circRNAs and to quantitatively evaluate their expression in publiclyavailable RNA-Seq data from breast cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. Weobserved and confirmed, by ChIP analysis, that exons involved in circularization events display significantly higher levels of the histone post-transcriptionalmodification H3K36me3 than non-circularizing exons. This result has potentialimpact on circRNA biogenesis since H3K36me3 has been involved in alternativesplicing mechanisms. By analyzing an Ago-HITS-CLIP dataset we also found thatcircularizing exons overlapped with an unexpectedly higher number of Ago binding sites than non-circularizing exons. Finally, we observed that a subset of MCF-7circRNAs are specific to tumor versus normal tissue, while others can distinguishLuminal from other tumor subtypes, thus suggesting that circRNAs can be exploitedas novel biomarkers and drug targets for breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24522 PMCID: PMC5865691PMID: 29581865
