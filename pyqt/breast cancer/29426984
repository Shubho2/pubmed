We studied the effect of parity and timesince last birth on breast cancer subtype and outcome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multivariate cohort studyincluding all premenopausal women with early breast cancer aged ≤ 50 years(N = 1306) at diagnosis at the University Hospitals Leuven (Jan. 2000-Dec. 2009).Primary study endpoints were the breast cancer subtype, disease-free survival,and distant disease-free survival by parity and time since last birth.Statistical methods used were baseline-category logits models and Coxproportional hazard models. Multivariable models were used to correct forpossible confounders.RESULTS: Breast cancer subtypes did not differ between nulliparous (N = 266) and parous women (N = 1040) but subtypes differed significantly in parous women bytime since last birth (p < 0.001). Tumors within 5 years of last birth wereproportionally more likely triple negative and HER-2 like, even when correctedfor age at diagnosis. After a mean follow-up period of 10 years, parous women hada better disease-free survival compared to nulliparous women (HR 0.733; CI0.560-0.961; p = 0.025, HR 0.738; CI 0.559-0.974; p = 0.032 before and aftercorrection for known prognostic factors, respectively). In parous women, a longertime since last birth was correlated with a longer disease-free survival comparedto patients with a recent pregnancy (HR 0.976; CI 0.957-0.996; p = 0.018).However, after correction, this association completely disappeared (HR 1.010; CI 0.982-1.040; p = 0.480).CONCLUSION: We observed a better disease-free survival for parous thannulliparous women. The influence of recent birth on disease-free survival isprobably due to tumor and patient characteristics, as recent birth is associated with more aggressive subtypes.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4701-6 PMID: 29426984
