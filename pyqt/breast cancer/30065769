Iran.Quinazoline is one of the most widespread scaffolds amongst natural and syntheticbioactive compounds. Recently the quinazoline derivatives and in particular the4-anilinoquinazolines have attracted much attention for their anticancerproperties due to their capability to stabilize the kinase activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A series of fifteen previously designed andsynthesized 4-anilinoquinazoline analogs (4-18) were evaluated for cytotoxicactivity on two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468). Ligandefficiency and binding mode studies were also done and evaluated for theirpotentially EGFR inhibitory effects in comparison with imatinib and erlotinib as reference drugs. Among the tested 4-anilinoquinazolines, compound 11 , whichcontains diethoxy at phenyl ring and morpholino pendants at positions 5 and 7 of the quinazoline ring, demonstrated the most potent biological activity on bothcell lines. Our new quinazoline derivatives with different substituents such ascyclic or linear ethers and flour groups may be a promising cytotoxic leadcompounds for further anti-breast cancer research.DOI: 10.4103/1735-5362.235163 PMCID: PMC6040169PMID: 30065769
