[Epub ahead of print]Assessment of Functional Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Pathway Activity in CancerTissue Using Forkhead Box O Target Gene Expression in a Knowledge-BasedComputational Model.van Ooijen H(1), Hornsveld M(2), Dam-de Veen C(1), Velter R(1), Dou M(1),Verhaegh W(1), Burgering B(2), van de Stolpe A(3).Author information: (1)Philips Research, Eindhoven, the Netherlands.(2)University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands.(3)Philips Research, Eindhoven, the Netherlands. Electronic address:anja.van.de.stolpe@philips.com.The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is commonly activated in cancer.Tumors are potentially sensitive to PI3K pathway inhibitors, but reliablediagnostic tests that assess functional PI3K activity are lacking. Because PI3Kpathway activity negatively regulates forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factor activity, FOXO target gene expression is inversely correlated with PI3K activity.A knowledge-based Bayesian computational model was developed to infer PI3Kactivity in cancer tissue samples from FOXO target gene mRNA levels and validatedin cancer cell lines treated with PI3K inhibitors. However, applied to patienttissue samples, FOXO was often active in cancer types with expected active PI3K. SOD2 was differentially expressed between FOXO-active healthy and cancer tissuesamples, indicating that cancer-associated cellular oxidative stressalternatively activated FOXO. To enable correct interpretation of active FOXO in cancer tissue, threshold levels for normal SOD2 expression in healthy tissue weredefined above which FOXO activity is oxidative stress induced and below whichPI3K regulated. In slow-growing luminal A breast cancer and low Gleason scoreprostate cancer, FOXO was active in a PI3K-regulated manner, indicating inactive PI3K. In aggressive luminal B, HER2, and basal breast cancer, FOXO wasincreasingly inactive or actively induced by oxidative stress, indicating PI3Kactivity. We provide a decision tree that facilitates functional PI3K pathwayactivity assessment in tissue samples from patients with cancer for therapyresponse prediction and prognosis.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.
