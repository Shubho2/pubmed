Although UGT genes are highly clustered,the formation of chimeric transcripts by intergenic splicing between two or more UGT genes has not yet been reported. This study identified 12 chimerictranscripts (chimeras A-L) containing exons from two or three genes of the fourneighboring UGT genes (UGT2B15, UGT2B29P2, UGT2B17, and UGT2B29P1) in human liverand prostate cancer cells. These chimeras typically contain the first five exons of UGT2B15 or UGT2B17 (exons 1-5) spliced to a terminal exon (exon 6) from adownstream UGT gene. Hence they encode truncated UGTs with novel C-terminalpeptides. Functional assays of representative chimeric UGT proteins (termedchimeric UGT2B15 and chimeric UGT2B17) showed that they are inactive and canrepress the activity of wild-type UGTs. Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstratedheterotypic interactions between chimeric UGT2B15 (or chimeric UGT2B17) and theUGT2B7 protein. Thus oligomerization of the chimeric UGTs with wild-type UGTs mayexplain their inhibitory activity. Studies in breast and prostate cancer cellsshowed that both wild-type and chimeric UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 transcripts areregulated in a similar way at the transcriptional level by sex hormones throughtheir canonical promoters but are differentially regulated at thepost-transcriptional level by micro-RNA 376c via their unique 3'-untranslatedregions. In conclusion, the formation of chimeric transcripts by intergenicsplicing among UGT genes represents a novel mechanism contributing to thediversity of the human UGT transcriptome and proteome. The differentialpost-transcriptional regulation of wild-type and variant transcripts bymicro-RNAs may contribute to their deregulated expression in cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/mol.118.111773 PMID: 29959221
