However, whether lytic EBV infection alsocontributes to tumors is unclear, although the association between malariainfection and Burkitt lymphomas (BLs) may involve excessive lytic EBVreplication. A particular variant of the viral promoter (Zp) that controls lytic EBV reactivation is over-represented, relative to its frequency in non-malignant tissue, in EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinomas and AIDS-related lymphomas. To date, no functional differences between the prototype Zp (Zp-P) and thecancer-associated variant (Zp-V3) have been identified. Here we show that asingle nucleotide difference between the Zp-V3 and Zp-P promoters creates abinding site for the cellular transcription factor, NFATc1, in the Zp-V3 (but notZp-P) variant, and greatly enhances Zp activity and lytic viral reactivation inresponse to NFATc1-inducing stimuli such as B-cell receptor activation andionomycin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restoring this NFATc1-motif to theZp-P variant in the context of the intact EBV B95.8 strain genome greatlyenhances lytic viral reactivation in response to the NFATc1-activating agent,ionomycin, and this effect is blocked by the NFAT inhibitory agent, cyclosporine,as well as NFATc1 siRNA. We also show that the Zp-V3 variant is over-represented in EBV-positive BLs and gastric cancers, and in EBV-transformed B-cell linesderived from EBV-infected breast milk of Kenyan mothers that had malaria duringpregnancy. These results demonstrate that the Zp-V3 enhances EBV lyticreactivation to physiologically-relevant stimuli, and suggest that increasedlytic infection may contribute to the increased prevalence of this variant inEBV-associated malignancies.DOI: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1007179 PMID: 30052684
