MATERIAL AND METHODS Aretrospective study included 3,944 patients diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004 and 2015 and with known blood type. Clinical and demographic patient dataincluded age, sex, body mass index (BMI), menopausal status. The breast tumortype, size, grade, TNM stage, and the presence of lymph node and distantmetastases were noted. Histopathology of the breast tumors had included routinedetection of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and estrogenreceptor (ER) levels. RESULTS The 3,944 patients with breast cancer were bloodgroup, type A, B, O, and Rh-positive or Rh-negative; the median age was 47.9years (range, 18.2-89.6 years); 99.5% (3923/3,844) were women, and 0.5% (21/3944)were men. Patients with blood type 0 had a significantly smaller tumor sizecompared with patients with blood types A or B. There were no significantdifferences between blood groups and patient age, BMI, menopausal status, tumorhistology, ER status, HER2 status, lymph node and distant metastasis. However,there was a significant difference in the prevalence of lobular breast cancer,levels of ER-positive tumor cells, and prevalence of cases with tumor metastases in Rh-positive patients compared with Rh-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS Thefindings of this retrospective study showed that the type, grade, stage, andhormonal status of breast cancer showed no significant associations with ABOblood grouping.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.909499 PMCID: PMC6069505PMID: 29981282
