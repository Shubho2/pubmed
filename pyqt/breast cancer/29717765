China.Gambogic acid (GA) has been widely used as an anticancer drug for differenttumors, including thyroid cancer. However, the potential function and molecularmechanisms of GA in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) has not been illustrated thusfar. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the antitumor effects of GA on ATC cells and investigate its underlying molecular mechanisms. The resultsrevealed that GA significantly decreased the viability and proliferation, as wellas induced cell apoptosis in ATC cell lines. Next, it was demonstrated that GAdecreased the expression of bromodomain‑containing protein 4 (BRD4), which hasbeen reported to function as an oncogene in various types of cancer. BRD4expression was significantly higher in ATC tissues compared with that in adjacentnormal thyroid tissues. In addition, BRD4 silencing significantly repressed thecell viability and proliferation, and increased the cell apoptotic rate in vitro,while it also delayed the tumor growth in vivo. Notably, ectopic BRD4 expression significantly weakened the biological effects of GA on ATC cells in vitro andin vivo, which suggested that GA served its anticancer functions partially viadownregulating BRD4. In conclusion, BRD4, functioning as an oncogene in ATC, isimportant for the antiproliferative and pro‑apoptotic effects of GA.DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3642 PMCID: PMC5979940PMID: 29717765
