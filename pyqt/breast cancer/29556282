China.Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer pathogenesis are not fullyunderstood. The present study examined the role of miR-433 in breast cancer andinvestigated its underlying molecular mechanisms of action. Reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysiswere performed to analyze the level of microRNA (miRNA/miR)/mRNA and proteinexpression, respectively. Additionally, MTT assay was used to determined cellproliferation and viability. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Adual-luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the identity of the downstreamtarget of miR-433. The results revealed that miR-433 was downregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-433 inhibited cellproliferation and cell viability in BT-549 cells, whereas downregulation ofmiR-433 increased cell proliferation and cell viability in MDA-MB-231 cells.Further flow cytometry analysis revealed that miR-433 was able to induceapoptosis and also alter the levels of proteins expression of B-cell lymphoma-2and Bcl-associated X. Bioinformatics analysis showed that RAC-Î³serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT3) was one of the downstream targets ofmiR-433, and luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that AKT3 is a directtarget of miR-433. The knockdown of AKT3 was able to inhibit proliferation andviability in BT-549 cells. Overexpression of AKT3 prevented the inhibitoryeffects of miR-433 on proliferation and viability in BT-549 cells. The level ofAKT3 mRNA expression was upregulated in breast cancer tissues compared withnormal tissues and was inversely correlated with miR-433 expression levels. Insummary, the results of the present study results indicate that thetumor-suppressive role of miR-433 may be mediated by regulating AKT3. miR-433 maytherefore serve as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7803 PMCID: PMC5844142PMID: 29556282
