Electronic address: feifeili717@ahmu.edu.cn.Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant subtype of breastcancer in which the cell surface lacks usual targets for drug to exhibit itseffects. Epirubicin (Epi) is widely used for TNBC, but a substantial number ofpatients develop Epi resistance that is usually associated with poor prognosis.Transforming growth factor (TGF-β) is a multifunctional cytokine. In recentstudy, it appears that TGF-β influences the cancer stem cell population, thus,the drug resistance of cancer may also be affected. We used epirubicin to treatMDA-MB-231 (MB-231) cells and found that TGF-β and breast cancer stem cellmarkers CD44+CD24- were increased and were dose-dependent of epirubicin. Weestablished drug-resistant cell line from parental MB-231 cells by chronictreatment with low-concentration epirubicin. The MB-231/Epi cell line showedrelatively slow growth rate with varied morphology. Transwell assay and drugsensitivity assay revealed that the malignant cell behaviors in terms ofmigration, invasion and epirubicin-resistant properties were markedly increasedin the MB-231/Epi cells. Western blot, immunofluorescence assay, and flowcytometry were used to analyze the expression levels of the breast cancer stemcell markers, CD44 and CD24. Mammospheres assay showed that the stemness ofMB-231/Epi was increased compared to their parental cells. Interestingly,MB-231/Epi cells showed different expression levels of apoptosis-related markers:Bcl2, Bax; EMT-related markers E-cadherin, N-cadherin and cell cycle-relatedmarker cyclinD1. These genes have all been shown to be regulated by the TGF-βpathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that TGF-β plays a vital role inTNBC epirubicin-resistance through regulating stemness, EMT and apoptosis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
