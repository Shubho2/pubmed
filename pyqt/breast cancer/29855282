Here, we evaluatedwhether obesity is differentially associated with the risk of breast tumorsubtypes, as defined by 6 immunohistochemical markers (ER, PR, HER2, Ki67, Bcl-2 and p53, separately and combined), in the prospective EPIC-Germany Study(n = 27,012).METHODS: Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues of 657incident breast cancer cases were used for histopathological analyses.Associations between BMI and breast cancer risk across subtypes were evaluated bymultivariable Cox regression models stratified by menopausal status and hormonetherapy (HT) use.RESULTS: Among postmenopausal non-users of HT, higher BMI was significantlyassociated with an increased risk of less aggressive, i.e. ER+, PR+, HER2-,Ki67low, Bcl-2+ and p53- tumors (HR per 5 kg/m2: 1.44 [1.10, 1.90], p = 0.009),but not with risk of more aggressive tumor subtypes. Among postmenopausal usersof HT, BMI was significantly inversely associated with less aggressive tumors (HRper 5 kg/m2: 0.68 [0.50, 0.94], p = 0.018). Finally, among pre- andperimenopausal women, Cox regression models did not reveal significant linearassociations between BMI and risk of any tumor subtype, although analyses by BMI tertiles showed a significantly lower risk of less aggressive tumors for women inthe highest tertile (HR: 0.55 [0.33, 0.93]).CONCLUSION: Overall, our results suggest that obesity is related to risk ofbreast tumors with lower aggressiveness, a finding that requires replication inlarger-scale analyses of pooled prospective data.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4548-6 PMCID: PMC5984403PMID: 29855282
