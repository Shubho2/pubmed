Recently, alterations of KIBRA expression caused by promotormethylation have been reported for several types of cancer. Our current studyaimed to design an artificial transcription factor capable of re-activatingexpression of the tumor suppressor KIBRA and the hippo pathway. We engineered anew gene named 'ZFP226' encoding for a ~23 kDa fusion protein. ZFP226 belongs to the Cys2-His2 zinc finger type and recognizes a nine base-pair DNA sequence5'-GGC-GGC-GGC-3' in the KIBRA core promoter P1a. ZFP226 showed nuclearlocalization in human immortalized kidney epithelial cells and activated theKIBRA core promoter (p < 0.001) resulting in significantly increased KIBRA mRNAand protein levels (p < 0.001). Furthermore, ZFP226 led to activation of hipposignaling marked by elevated YAP and LATS phosphorylation. In Annexin V flowcytometry assays ZFP226 overexpression showed strong pro-apoptotic capacity onMCF-7 breast cancer cells (p < 0.01 early-, p < 0.001 late-apoptotic cells). Weconclude that the artificial transcription factor ZFP226 can be used for targetKIBRA and hippo pathway activation. This novel molecule may represent a moleculartool for the development of future applications in cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22600-6 PMCID: PMC5844865PMID: 29523820
