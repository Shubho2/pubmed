Although numerous publicationshave reported the correlation between B7-H3 and cancer progression in many types of cancers, mechanistic studies on how B7-H3 regulates cancer malignancy arerare, and the mechanisms underlying the role of B7-H3 in drug resistance arealmost unknown. Here we report a novel finding that upregulation of B7-H3increases the breast cancer stem cell population and promotes cancer development.Depletion of B7-H3 in breast cancer significantly inhibits the cancer stem cells.By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we found that B7-H3 is associatedwith the major vault protein (MVP) and activates MEK through MVP-enhancing B-RAF and MEK interaction. B7-H3 expression increases stem cell population by bindingto MVP which regulates the activation of the MAPK kinase pathway. Depletion ofMVP blocks the activation of MEK induced by B7-H3 and dramatically inhibits B7-H3induced stem cells. This study reports novel functions of B7-H3 in regulatingbreast cancer stem cell enrichment. The novel mechanism for B7-H3-induced stemcell propagation by regulating MVP/MEK signaling axis independent of the classic Ras pathway may have important implications in the development of strategies for overcoming cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0407-9 PMID: 30082909
