The composite was characterized by using FT-IR, XRD,HRTEM, SAED, EDS, and SEM. TEM images showed the hexagonal shape of nanocompositewith the size range of 50-70 nm. Further, PEC-GG-ZnO was used as animmunomodulator for the first time to improve the cancer cells killingcapabilities of human peripheral-blood lymphocytes (PBL). The lymphocyteproliferation assay proved the immunostimulatory property of the PEC-GG-ZnO whichincreased with the increase in concentration (25 μg/ml to 200 μg/ml). ELISAdetection confirmed a significant increase in the release of IFN-γ, IL-2 andTNF-α cytokines and flow cytometry analysis revealed enhanced expression of CD3, CD8, and CD56 after treating PBL with PEC-GG-ZnO as compared to PEC and GGtreatment. Moreover, we also found that nanocomposite pretreated human PBLdisplayed enhanced cytotoxicity towards lung (A549) and breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cells as compared to untreated PBL. The microcytotoxicity assay also demonstratedthat with increase in effector: target ratios from 2.5:1 to 20:1, there was anincrease in the cancer cell death. Taken together, the current data corroborates the immunostimulatory activities of PEC-GG-ZnO, a novel nanocomposite, hence itcan serve as a promising cancer therapeutic agent.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
