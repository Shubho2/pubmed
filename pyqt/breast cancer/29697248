Here, we designed iodinated,water-soluble NIR boron dipyrromethene-based PSs to achieve image-guided andefficient PDT against cancer in vivo that is enhanced by leveragingtumor-specific pH-responsive activation. PEG2k5c-I and PEG2k5c-OMe-I localized totumors and were activated by acidic pH in the tumor microenvironment to produce1O2 and fluorescence for efficient PDT and effective cancer detection afterintravenous administration. Upon NIR irradiation, these PSs exhibited strong NIR absorption at 660 and 690 nm, stable NIR emission at 692 and 742 nm, and high 1O2quantum yields of 0.78 and 0.72 in acidic pH. PEG2k5c-I and PEG2k5c-OMe-I killed cancer cells upon irradiation of NIR light and were nontoxic without irradiation.Light-activated PDT treatment of breast cancer tumors in mice resulted insuppression of tumor growth, DNA damage, and necrosis selectively in tumors. Thiswork thus introduces a versatile method to directly synthesize modularpH-responsive water-soluble PSs and provides a versatile strategy for activatablePDT against cancer.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b04710 PMID: 29697248
