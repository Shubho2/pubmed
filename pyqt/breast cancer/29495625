They are formed by proteins named connexins(Cxs) that have long been considered as a tumor suppressor. This widespread view has been challenged by recent studies suggesting that the role of Connexin 43(Cx43) in cancer is tissue- and stage-specific and can even promote tumorprogression. High throughput profiling of invasive breast cancer has allowed for the construction of subtyping schemes that partition patients into at least four distinct intrinsic subtypes. This study characterizes Cx43 expression duringcancer progression with each of the tumor subtypes using a compendium of publiclyavailable gene expression data. In particular, we show that Cx43 expressiondepends greatly on intrinsic subtype. Tumor grade also co-varies with patientsubtype, resulting in Cx43 co-expression with grade in a subtype-dependentmanner. Better survival was associated with a high expression of Cx43 inunstratified and luminal tumors but with a low expression in Her2e subtype. Abetter understanding of Cx43 regulation in a subtype-dependent manner is neededto clarify the context in which Cx43 is associated with tumor suppression orcancer progression.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19030693 PMCID: PMC5877554PMID: 29495625
