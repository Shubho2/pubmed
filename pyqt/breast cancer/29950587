In this study, nationalstatistical data were used to study the association between these forms ofalopecia and the risk of cancer. We enrolled 668,604 patients who were treatedfor alopecia from 2007 to 2014, and age- and sex-matched control subjects. AA andAT/AU patients had slightly higher overall cancer risks (hazard ratio (HR),1.043; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.022-1.065 and HR, 1.07; 95% CI,1.013-1.129, respectively) than controls, after adjusting for confoundingfactors. The risks of oral cavity, esophagus, liver, biliary tract, pancreas,larynx, lung, kidney, breast, cervix, ovary, uterus, testis, nerve, and skincancers; and lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia, were not increased inalopecia patients. In AA or AT/AU patients, the only increased risk was that ofthyroid cancer. In AA patients alone, the risks of bladder and prostate cancerswere increased. Thus, the cancer risks varied by the alopecia subtype. Carefulmonitoring is needed to explore if the actual risks of thyroid, bladder, andprostate cancers are increased in alopecia patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-28142-1 PMCID: PMC6021412PMID: 29950587
