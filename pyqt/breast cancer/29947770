[Epub ahead of print]Modeling dynamics for oncogenesis encompassing mutations and genetic instability.Fassoni AC(1), Yang HM(2).Author information: (1)Instituto de Matemática e Computação, UNIFEI, Itajubá, Minas Gerais, Brazil.(2)Instituto de Matemática, Estatística e Computação Científica, UNICAMP,Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil.Tumorigenesis has been described as a multistep process, where each step isassociated with a genetic alteration, in the direction to progressively transforma normal cell and its descendants into a malignant tumour. Into this work, wepropose a mathematical model for cancer onset and development, considering three populations: normal, premalignant and cancer cells. The model takes into account three hallmarks of cancer: self-sufficiency on growth signals, insensibility toanti-growth signals and evading apoptosis. By using a nonlinear expression todescribe the mutation from premalignant to cancer cells, the model includesgenetic instability as an enabling characteristic of tumour progression.Mathematical analysis was performed in detail. Results indicate that apoptosisand tissue repair system are the first barriers against tumour progression. Oneof these mechanisms must be corrupted for cancer to develop from a single mutant cell. The results also show that the presence of aggressive cancer cells opensway to survival of less adapted premalignant cells. Numerical simulations wereperformed with parameter values based on experimental data of breast cancer, and the necessary time taken for cancer to reach a detectable size from a singlemutant cell was estimated with respect to some parameters. We find that the ratesof apoptosis and mutations have a large influence on the pace of tumourprogression and on the time it takes to become clinically detectable.DOI: 10.1093/imammb/dqy010 PMID: 29947770
