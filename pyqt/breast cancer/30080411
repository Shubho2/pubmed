[Epub ahead ofprint]Polychlorinated biphenyl quinones promotes breast cancer metastasis throughROS-mediated nuclear factor kappa B-matrix metalloproteinase signaling.Wang Y, Wang Y, Liu Z, Dong W, Yang B, Xia X, Song E, Song Y.It is generally acknowledged that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) exposureincreased the incidence of cancer, however, the underlying mechanism(s) ofPCBs-induced cancer metastasis are unclear. PCBs is readily to metabolize, littleinformation is available regarding the effect of PCBs metabolites on cancermetastasis. Currently, we evaluated a high reactive PCBs metabolite,2,3,5-trichloro-6-phenyl-[1,4]-benzoquinone (PCB29-pQ), relevant exposure withmammary cancer metastasis. Multiple line of evidences illustrated that PCB29-pQinduces breast cancer invasion and migration. In particular, this appearance isassociated with two-fold elevation of matrix metalloproteinases-2/-9 (MMP-2/-9)and extracellular nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), respectively. Our resultsclearly demonstrated the translocation of cytosolic NF-κB into the nucleus, by a factor of about 2.4. We also revealed the activation of corresponding upstreamsignaling cascades phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and p38, and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), by factors of 3.15, 3.09 and 1.69, respectively. Moreover, therewas a marked induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after PCB29-pQ challenge and antioxidant treatment markedly inhibited PCB29-pQ-mediated activation ofthese axis signaling. Collectively, our result suggested that PCB29-pQ inducesbreast cancer metastasis via ROS-dependent NF-κB-MMP signaling.DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.8b00148 PMID: 30080411
