Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, possessesanti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that treatment with DHA wouldreduce the expression of proinflammatory genes and aromatase, the rate-limitingenzyme for estrogen biosynthesis, in benign breast tissue of overweight/obesewomen. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase II study of DHA givenfor 12 weeks to overweight/obese women with a history of stage I-III breastcancer, DCIS/LCIS, Paget's disease, or proliferative benign breast disease wascarried out. In this placebo controlled trial, the primary objective was todetermine whether DHA (1,000 mg by mouth twice daily) reduced breast tissuelevels of TNFα. Secondary objectives included evaluation of the effect of DHA on breast tissue levels of COX-2, IL1β, aromatase, white adipose tissueinflammation, and gene expression by RNA-seq. Red blood cell fatty acid levelswere measured to assess compliance. From July 2013 to November 2015, 64participants were randomized and treated on trial (32 women per arm). Increasedlevels of omega-3 fatty acids in red blood cells were detected followingtreatment with DHA (P < 0.001) but not placebo. Treatment with DHA did not alter levels of TNFα (P = 0.71), or other biomarkers including the transcriptome inbreast samples. Treatment with DHA was overall well-tolerated. Althoughcompliance was confirmed, we did not observe changes in the levels ofprespecified biomarkers in the breast after treatment with DHA when compared withplacebo.
