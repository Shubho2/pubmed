In the analysis of omics data, clustering is an essential step and serves multiplepurposes including for example revealing the unknown functionalities of omicsunits, assisting dimension reduction in outcome model building, and others. Inthe most recent omics studies, a prominent trend is to conduct multilayerprofiling, which collects multiple types of genetic, genomic, epigenetic andother measurements on the same subjects. In the literature, clustering methodstailored to multilayer omics data are still limited. Directly applying theexisting clustering methods to multilayer omics data and clustering each layerfirst and then combing across layers are both "suboptimal" in that they do notaccommodate the interconnections within layers and across layers in aninformative way.METHODS: In this study, we develop the MuNCut (Multilayer NCut) clusteringapproach. It is tailored to multilayer omics data and sufficiently accounts forboth across- and within-layer connections. It is based on the novel NCuttechnique and also takes advantages of regularized sparse estimation. It has anintuitive formulation and is computationally very feasible. To facilitateimplementation, we develop the function muncut in the R package NcutYX.RESULTS: Under a wide spectrum of simulation settings, it outperformscompetitors. The analysis of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data on breast cancerand cervical cancer shows that MuNCut generates biologically meaningful resultswhich differ from those using the alternatives.CONCLUSIONS: We propose a more effective clustering analysis of multiple omicsdata. It provides a new venue for jointly analyzing genetic, genomic, epigenetic and other measurements.DOI: 10.1186/s12864-018-4580-6 PMCID: PMC5991460PMID: 29703159
