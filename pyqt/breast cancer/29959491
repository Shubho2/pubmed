Data for 111 micrometastatic diseases were applied to the PREDICTversion 2.0 and re-classified using the 8th edition of the cancer staging manual.RESULTS: Univariable analyses demonstrated worse disease-free and overallsurvival rates for patients with node-positive cancer; however, the significance was not maintained in multivariable analyses. Chemotherapy improved outcomes inpatients with node-positive and non-luminal A-like subtype cancers. The PREDICTtool demonstrated good performance when estimating the 5-year overall survivalfor pN1mi disease (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve,0.834). According to the updated staging system, 74% of cases were down-staged toIA, and clearly splitting survival curves were identified.CONCLUSION: pN1mi disease alone did not adversely affect survival outcomes.Biologic and treatment factors determined outcomes in cases of small-volume node micrometastasis. The PREDICT tool or new staging classification could helppredict the survival of patients with micrometastatic sentinel nodes.DOI: 10.1007/s00268-018-4725-4 PMID: 29959491
