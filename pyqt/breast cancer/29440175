Molecular patterns representing tissue orhistologic dominant effects were first removed computationally, with theresulting classes representing emergent themes across tumor lineages.Results: Keydifferences involving mRNAs, miRNAs, proteins, and DNA methylation underscoredthe pan-cancer classes. One class expressing neuroendocrine and cancer-testisantigen markers represented ∼4% of cancers surveyed. Basal-like breast cancerssegregated into an exclusive class, distinct from all other cancers. Immunecheckpoint pathway markers and molecular signatures of immune infiltrates weremost strongly manifested within a class representing ∼13% of cancers.Pathway-level differences involving hypoxia, NRF2-ARE, Wnt, and Notch weremanifested in two additional classes enriched for mesenchymal markers and miR200 silencing.Conclusions: All pan-cancer molecular classes uncovered here, with the important exception of the basal-like breast cancer class, involve a wide rangeof cancer types and would facilitate understanding the molecular underpinnings ofcancers beyond tissue-oriented domains. Numerous biological processes associated with cancer in the laboratory setting were found here to be coordinatelymanifested across large subsets of human cancers. The number of cancersmanifesting features of neuroendocrine tumors may be much higher than previously thought, which disease is known to occur in many different tissues.
