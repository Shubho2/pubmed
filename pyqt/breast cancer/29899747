Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) do not express HER2 or the receptors forestrogen or progesterone, and so often have a poor prognosis. Tumor-infiltrating T cells have been well-characterized in TNBC, and increased numbers areassociated with better outcomes; however, the potential roles of B cells andplasma cells have been large. Here, we conducted a retrospective correlativestudy on the expression of B cell/plasma cell-related genes, and the abundanceand localization of B cells and plasma cells within TNBCs, and clinical outcome. We analyzed 269 TNBC samples and used immunohistochemistry to quantifytumor-infiltrating B cells and plasma cells, coupled with NanoString measurement of expression of immunoglobulin metagenes. Multivariate analysis revealed thatpatients bearing TNBCs with above-median densities of CD38+ plasma cells hadsignificantly better disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.26-0.77;p = 0.004) but not overall survival (OS), after adjusting for the effects ofknown prognostic factors. In contrast, TNBCs with higher immunoglobulin geneexpression exhibited improved prognosis (OS p = 0.029 and DFS p = 0.005). Thepresence of B cells and plasma cells was positively correlated (p < 0.0001,R = 0.558), while immunoglobulin gene IGKC, IGHM, and IGHG1 mRNA expressioncorrelated specifically with the density of CD38+ plasma cells (IGKC p < 0.0001, R = 0.647; IGHM p < 0.0001, R = 0.580; IGHG1 p < 0.0001, R = 0.655).Interestingly, after adjusting the multivariate analysis for the effect ofintratumoral CD38+ plasma cell density, the expression levels of all three genes lost significant prognostic value, suggesting a biologically important role ofplasma cells. Last but not least, the addition of intratumoral CD38+ plasma cell density to clinicopathological features significantly increased the prognosticvalue for both DFS (ΔLRχ2 = 17.28, p = 1.71E-08) and OS (ΔLRχ2 = 10.03,p = 6.32E-08), compared to clinicopathological features alone. The bestcombination was achieved by integrating intratumoral CD38+ plasma cell densityand IGHG1 which conferred the best added prognostic value for DFS (ΔLRχ2 = 27.38,p = 5.22E-10) and OS (ΔLRχ2 = 21.29, p = 1.03E-08). Our results demonstrate that the role of plasma cells in TNBC warrants further study to elucidate therelationship between their infiltration of tumors and disease recurrence.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01209 PMCID: PMC5988856PMID: 29899747
