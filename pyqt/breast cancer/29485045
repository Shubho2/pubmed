These polarized macrophages were co-cultured with IBC cells (SUM149,KPL4, MDA-IBC3, or SUM190) without direct contact for 24 hours, then subjected toirradiation (0, 2, 4, or 6 Gy). Interleukin (IL)4/IL13-induced activation ofSTAT6 signaling was measured by Western blotting of phospho-STAT6 (Tyr641), andexpression of M2 polarization gene markers (CD206, fibronectin, and CCL22) wasmeasured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: Expression of M2 polarization markers was higher in M2-polarizedmacrophages after IL4/IL13 treatment than in control (M0) or M1-polarizedmacrophages. Co-culture of IBC cell lines with M1-polarized THP-1 macrophagesmediated radiosensitivity of IBC cells, whereas co-culture with M2-polarizedmacrophages mediated radioresistance. Phosphopeptide mimetic PM37, targeting the SH2 domain of STAT6, prevented and reversed IL4/IL13-mediated STAT6phosphorylation (Tyr641) and decreased the expression of M2 polarization markers.Pretreatment of M2-THP1 macrophages with PM37 reduced the radioresistance theyinduced in IBC cells after co-culture. Targeted proteomics analysis of IBC KPL4cells using a kinase antibody array revealed induction of protein kinase C zeta(PRKCZ) in these cells only after co-culture with M2-THP1 macrophages, which was prevented by PM37 pretreatment. KPL4 cells with stable short hairpin RNAknockdown of PRKCZ exhibited lower radioresistance after M2-THP1 co-culture.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that inhibition of M2 polarization of macrophagesby PM37 can prevent radioresistance of IBC by down-regulating PRKCZ.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.
