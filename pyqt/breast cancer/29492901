Also, its potential toinduce autophagy has been established. Unfolded protein responses and starvation of amino acids are known to trigger autophagy. As yet, however, the molecularmechanism underlying PA deficiency-induced autophagy is not fully clarified.Here, we aimed to determine the apoptotic effect of DENSpm after autophagyinhibition by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or siRNA-mediated Beclin-1 silencing incolon cancer cells.METHODS: The apoptotic effects of DENSpm after 3-MA treatment or Beclin-1silencing were determined by PI and AnnexinV/PI staining in conjunction with flowcytometry. Intracellular PA levels were measured by HPLC, whereas autophagy andthe expression profiles of PA key players were determined in HCT116, SW480 andHT29 colon cancer cells by Western blotting.RESULTS: We found that DENSpm-induced autophagy was inhibited by 3-MA treatmentand Beclin-1 silencing, and that apoptotic cell death was increased by PAdepletion and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) upregulation. Wealso found that autophagy inhibition led to DENSpm-induced apoptosis through Atg5down-regulation, p62 degradation and LC3 lipidation in both HCT116 and SW480cells. p53 deficiency did not alter the response of the colon cancer cells toDENSpm-induced apoptotic cell death under autophagy suppression conditions.CONCLUSIONS: From our results we conclude that DENSpm-induced apoptotic celldeath is increased when autophagy is inhibited by 3-MA or Beclin-1 siRNA through PA depletion and PA catabolic activation in colon cancer cells, regardless p53mutation status.DOI: 10.1007/s13402-017-0369-x PMID: 29492901
