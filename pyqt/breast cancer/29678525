Whether close margins <2 mm are associated with inferior outcomes remains controversial. This study evaluated 10-year outcomes by margin status in a population-basedcohort treated with BCS and adjuvant radiation therapy (RT).METHODS AND MATERIALS: The subjects were 10,863 women with invasive cancercategorized as pT1 to T3, any N, and M0 referred from 2001 to 2011, an era inwhich the institutional policy was to re-excise close or positive margins, exceptin select cases. All women underwent BCS and whole-breast RT with or withoutboost RT. Local recurrence (LR) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) wereexamined using competing-risk analysis in cohorts with negative (≥2 mm; n = 9241,85%), close (<2 mm; n = 1310, 12%), or positive (tumor touching ink; n = 312, 3%)margins. Multivariable analysis and matched-pair analysis were performed.RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 8 years. Systemic therapy was used in87% of patients. Boost RT was used in 34.1%, 76.9%, and 79.5% of patients withnegative, close, and positive margins, respectively. In the negative, close, and positive margin cohorts, the 10-year cumulative incidence of LR was 1.8%, 2.0%,and 1.1%, respectively (P = .759). Corresponding BCSS estimates were 93.9%,91.8%, and 87.9%, respectively (P < .001). On multivariable analysis, closemargins were not associated with increased LR (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidenceinterval 0.79-1.97; P = .350) or reduced BCSS (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidenceinterval 0.98-1.58, P = .071) relative to negative margins. On matched-pairanalysis, close margin cases had similar LR (P = .114) and BCSS (P = .100) tonegative margin controls.CONCLUSIONS: Select cases with close or positive margins in this population-basedanalysis had similar LR and BCSS to cases with negative margins. While thesefindings do not endorse omitting re-excision for all cases, the data support apolicy of accepting carefully selected cases with close margins for adjuvant RTwithout re-excision.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
