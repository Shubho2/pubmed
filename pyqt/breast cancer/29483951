Few studies have examined whether the associations between reproductivefactors and breast cancer differed across races/ethnicities. Methods We analyzed a sub-sample (70, 734) of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO)dataset. Participants with valid baseline questionnaire and without breast cancerat enrollment were included into analysis. We stratified the participants intosubgroups based on their races/ethnicities then estimated the effects of thereproductive factors on breast cancer within each group using Cox-proportionregression models. Results Oral contraceptive use (HR=1.09, 95% confidenceinterval or CI=1.01, 1.18), advanced age at natural menopause (HR=1.25, 95%CI=1.06, 1.49) were associated with increased risk of breast cancer innon-Hispanic Caucasians group only. Long term use of menopausal hormone therapy(more than five years) was associated with increased risk of breast cancer inboth of the non-Hispanic Caucasian (HR=1.44, 95% CI=1.31, 1.59) group and thenon-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (HR=1.98, 95% CI=1.23, 3.20) group, but notin other race/ethnic groups. Hispanics who tried to become pregnant for a year ormore had increased risk of breast cancer (HR=2.60, 95% CI=1.05, 6.46) than their counterparts without difficulty in getting pregnancy. In addition, surgeryinduced menopause was found to be a protective factor for breast cancer innon-Hispanic Caucasian (HR=0.88, 95% CI=0.79, 0.98) group only. Conclusions Weconcluded that different races/ethnicities had different breast cancer relatedreproductive risk factors. Non-Hispanic Caucasians had the most breast cancerrelated reproductive risk factors, while the minorities had none or few breastcancer related reproductive risk factors and among these few factors only 1 wasalso risk factor for non-Hispanic Caucasians.DOI: 10.7150/jca.22869 PMCID: PMC5820913PMID: 29483951
