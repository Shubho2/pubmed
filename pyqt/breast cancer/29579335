It evaluatedwhether survival differed between cancers diagnosed in 1992-2002 (the earlierperiod) and cancers diagnosed in 2003-2013 (the later period) and by the age atdiagnosis (<65 vs ≥65 years), stage at diagnosis (local orregional/distant/unknown), and sex. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazardsmodels were used to estimate univariate and multivariate-adjusted cause-specific survival for each cancer.RESULTS: An improvement was observed in 5-year survival over time from lungcancer (hazard ratio [HR] for the later period vs the earlier period, 0.83; 95%confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.97), and a marginally nonsignificant improvementwas observed for colorectal cancer (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-1.01). Site-specificdifferences in survival were observed by age and stage at diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the first data on cancer survival among ANpeople in almost 2 decades. During this time, AN people have experiencedimprovements in survival from lung and colorectal cancers. The reasons for these improvements may include increased access to care (including screening) as wellas improvements in treatment. Improving cancer survival should be a priority for reducing the burden of cancer among AN people and eliminating cancer disparities.Cancer 2018;124:2570-7. © 2018 American Cancer Society.© 2018 American Cancer Society.DOI: 10.1002/cncr.31350 PMCID: PMC6028236 [Available on 2019-06-15]PMID: 29579335
