Overall, niraparib is welltolerated and its toxicities, primarily hematologic, are manageable especiallywith recently released initial dose modification guidelines based on weight andbaseline platelet count. The role of niraparib as maintenance following frontlineplatinum-based chemotherapy as well as in the treatment of recurrent high-gradeserous ovarian cancer is an active area of investigation. Areas covered: Thisreview focuses on niraparib, its pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and adverseeffects as evidenced by prospective clinical trials, and licensed indications.Expert commentary: Niraparib introduced the use of PARP inhibitors regardless of biomarker status. Recent studies highlight the critical need for more accuratebiomarkers to identify patients most likely to benefit from treatment with PARPinhibitors. In the next 5Â years, we anticipate further expansion of andelucidation regarding the optimal indication for use of niraparib in thetreatment of ovarian cancer.DOI: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1490180 PMID: 29911447
