And treatments against CSCs are well concerned issues.Peptides targeting to mouse and human CSCs were screened from an M13 phagedisplay library. The first subset of cancer stem cell homing peptides (CSC HPs), CSC HP-1 to -12, were screened with mouse EMT6 breast cancer stem cells. Amongthem, CSC HP-1, CSC HP-3, CSC HP-8, CSC HP-9, and CSC HP-10 can bind to mouseCT26 colon CSCs; CSC HP-1, CSC HP-2, CSC HP-3, and CSC HP-8 can bind to mouseHepa1-6 liver CSCs; as well as CSC HP-1, CSC HP-2, CSC HP-3, CSC HP-8, CSC HP-9, CSC HP-10, and CSC HP-11 can bind to human PANC-1 pancreatic CSCs. The secondsubset of cancer stem cell homing peptides, CSC HP-hP1 to -hP3, were screenedwith human PANC-1 pancreatic CSCs. Both CSC HP-hP1 and CSC HP-hP2 weredemonstrated able to bind mouse EMT6, CT26 and Hepa1-6 CSCs as well as humancolorectal HT29 and lung H1650 CSCs. CSC HP-1 and CSC HP-hP1 could stronglyassociate with the Globo 4 and Lewis Y glycan epitopes coupled on a microarraychip or Globo 4 and Globo H conjugated on bovine serum albumin. CSC HP-10, CSCHP-11 and CSC HP-hP2 could associate with the disialylated saccharideNeu5Ac-α-2,6-Gal-β-1,3-(Neu5Ac-α-2,6)-GalNAc coupled on a microarray chip. These results indicate that the CSC HPs may target to the known stem cell glycanmarkers GbH and Lewis Y as well as the disialylated saccharide.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24960 PMCID: PMC5945507PMID: 29755667
