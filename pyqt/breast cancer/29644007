BFFS rate at 36 months was lowerin patients with RILAlow and HT+ than in patients with RILAhigh and HT- (75.8%and 100%, respectively; p = 0.004, hazard ratio 5.84 [95% confidence interval(CI) 1.8-19.1]). Conversely, BFFS at 36 months was comparable in patients withRILAhigh and HT+ and in patients with RILAlow and HT- (89.8% and 93.5%,respectively; p = 0.39, hazard ratio 1.7 [95% CI 0.51-5.65]), showing that these two parameters influenced independently the occurrence of severe breast fibrosis.BFFS rate was not affected by the HT type (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor) and timing (concomitant or sequential with radiotherapy).Conclusions: HT and RILA score independently influenced BFFS rate at 36 months.Patients with RILAhigh and HT- presented an excellent BFFS at 36 months (100%).Materials and methods: Breast Fibrosis-Free Survival (BFFS) rate was assessedrelative to RILA categories and to adjuvant HT use (HT+ and HT-, respectively) ina prospective multicentre study (NCT00893035) which enrolled 502 breast cancerpatients (456 evaluable patients). Breast fibrosis was recorded according toCTCAE v3.0 grading scale; RILA score was defined according to two categories(<12%: RILAlow; ≥12%: RILAhigh).DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24606 PMCID: PMC5884662PMID: 29644007
