This study assesses evolution inpatterns of fertility discussion/preservation over time and reports pregnancyoutcomes in a cohort of young BC patients.METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 590 BC patients aged ≤40 diagnosed between2000 and 2016 at a large cancer center was identified. Fertility counseling andpreservation patterns for patients receiving chemotherapy were analyzed andcompared for two cohorts: 2004-2006 and 2014-2016 (total n = 161). Outcomes were reported for patients with documented pregnancy after BC.RESULTS: Significantly, more patients diagnosed in 2014-2016 had evidence ofdiscussion on fertility issues and/or application of fertility preservationtechniques versus patients diagnosed in 2004-2006 (82.9% vs. 66.0%, p = 0.017).In particular, there was a significant difference in rate of documented fertilityissues discussion (67.6% vs. 34.0%, p < 0.001). Age >35 and parity wereassociated with lower rates of fertility discussion/preservation. However, rates significantly improved over time (77.6% in 2014-2016 vs. 58.1% in 2004-2006 forpatients aged >35, p = 0.046; 80.7% in 2014-2016 vs. 57.6% in 2004-2006 forpatients with children at diagnosis, p = 0.018). Twenty-six patients withpregnancy after BC were identified; eight delivered at the age of >40. Nocomplications for women or newborns were reported. Only two patients experienced BC relapse.CONCLUSIONS: In this small retrospective cohort, no safety concerns wereidentified for pregnancy after BC. The importance attributed by clinicians toaddress fertility issues has increased over time.DOI: 10.1089/jwh.2018.6986 PMID: 29963941
