The objective of the present analysis was toassess the effects of marital status on survival in patients with HR positiveMBC. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients diagnosed with HR positive MBC from 1990 to2014 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database wereincluded. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard regressionwere used to identify the effects of marital status on cancer-specific survival(CSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS A total of 3612 cases were identified inthis study. Married patients had better 5-year CSS and 5-year OS than unmarriedmen. In multivariate Cox regression models, unmarried patients also showed highermortality risk for both CSS and OS, independent of age, race, grade, stage, PRstatus, HER2 status, and surgery. Subgroup survival analysis according todifferent ER/PR status showed that married patients had beneficial CSS resultsonly in ER+/PR+ subtype, and CSS in the married and unmarried groups did notsignificantly differ by TNM stage. The results were further confirmed in the 1: 1matched group. CONCLUSIONS Marital status was an important prognostic factor for survival in patients with HR positive MBC. Unmarried patients are at greater riskof death compared with married groups. The survival benefit for married patients remained even after adjustment, which indicates the importance of spousal supportin MBC.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.910811 PMCID: PMC5994964PMID: 29795054
