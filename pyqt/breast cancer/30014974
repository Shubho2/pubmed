This study sought to determine the prevalence and risk factors forfatigue among breast cancer (BC) survivors receiving aromatase inhibitors (AIs).MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study amongpostmenopausal women with stage 0 to III BC receiving adjuvant AI therapy at the outpatient breast oncology clinic of a large university hospital. Participantswith a score ≥4 on the 'worst fatigue' item of the Brief Fatigue Inventory wereclassified as having moderate or severe fatigue. Multivariate logistic regressionanalyses were performed to evaluate risk factors.RESULTS: Among 1103 participants, 616 (55.8%) had moderate or severe fatigue. In the multivariate logistic regression model, women younger than 55 years weresignificantly more likely to report moderate to severe fatigue than women olderthan 65 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.07-2.35; p = 0.023). Compared to women with high school or less education,women with college or more education were significantly more likely to reportmoderate to severe fatigue (AOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.02-1.91; p = 0.037).Increasing body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with increased riskof experiencing moderate to severe fatigue (overweight: AOR = 1.37, 95% CI =1.01-1.84, p = 0.042; obesity: AOR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.53-2.81, p < 0.001).Fatigue was significantly correlated with pain severity (r = 0.48, p < 0.001) andinsomnia (r = 0.62, p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Moderate to severe fatigue complaints exceed 50% among AI users.Fatigue is highly related to younger age, higher education level, higher BMI,pain severity and insomnia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
