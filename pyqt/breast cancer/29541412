We investigatedthe role of FEN1 in cisplatin resistance and the chemosensitizing effects ofcurcumin in breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that FEN1 overexpressionpromotes cisplatin resistance in breast cancer cells, and that FEN1 knockdownenhances cisplatin sensitivity. Curcumin down-regulated FEN1 expression in adose-dependent manner. A combination of cisplatin and curcumin enhanced breastcancer cell sensitivity to cisplatin by down-regulating FEN1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Increased ERK phosphorylation contributed to cisplatin resistanceand cisplatin-induced FEN1 overexpression in breast cancer cells. Inhibiting ERK phosphorylation stimulated the chemosensitizing effect of curcumin to cisplatinby targeting FEN1. These data reveal that FEN1 overexpression promotes cisplatin resistance, and suggest FEN1 could be a potential therapeutic target to relievecisplatin resistance in breast cancer. We also demonstrated that curcuminsensitizes breast cancer cells to cisplatin through FEN1 down-regulation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24109 PMCID: PMC5834274PMID: 29541412
