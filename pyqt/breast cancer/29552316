R.China.IL-6 is critical for tumorigenesis. However, previous studies on the association of IL-6 promoter polymorphisms with predisposition to different cancer types are somewhat contradictory. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis regarding the relationship between IL-6 promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms and cancersusceptibility and prognosis. Up to April 2017, 97 original publications wereidentified covering three IL-6 promoter SNPs. Our results showed statisticallysignificant association between IL-6 promoter and cancer risk and prognosis.Subgroup analysis indicated that rs1800795 was significantly associated withincreased risk of cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostatecancer, lung cancer, glioma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma butnot gastric cancer and multiple myeloma. Furthermore, rs1800796 was significantlyassociated with increased risk of lung cancer, prostate cancer and colorectalcancer but not gastric cancer. Additionally, rs1800797 was significantlyassociation with breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma anddiffuse large B-cell lymphoma but not gastric cancer. Simultaneously, rs1800795and rs1800796 were associated with a significantly higher risk of cancer in Asia and Caucasian, rs1800797 was associated with a significantly risk of cancer inCaucasian but not in Asia. Furthermore, IL-6 promoter polymorphisms weresignificantly associated with the prognosis of cancer. Considering thesepromising results, IL-6 promoter including rs1800795, rs1800796 and rs1800797 maybe a tumor marker for cancer therapy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24033 PMCID: PMC5844752PMID: 29552316
