Fulvestrant and tamoxifen represent the majorendocrine drugs for the treatment of breast cancer patients, and yet little isknown about the biological mechanisms of acquiring resistance to fulvestrant and tamoxifen, let alone the differences between cell lines resistant to these twodrugs. Exploration of the differential miRNA profiles between these two celllines is a useful way to further clarify these resistance mechanisms. Thefulvestrant-resistant cell line (MCF7-F) and the tamoxifen-resistant cell line(MCF7-T) were established from the drug-sensitive parental MCF7 cell line using a21-day high-dose antiestrogen induction method. Differentially expressed miRNAprofiles of MCF7-F and MCF7-T were detected using microarray; then, multiplebioinformatic analyses were carried out, including protein-protein interactionnetwork, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathwayanalysis. Compared with the parental MCF7 cell line, more miRNAs were found to beparticipating in the process of acquiring fulvestrant resistance than tamoxifenresistance. miR-4532, miR-486-5p, miR-138, miR-1228, and miR-3178 could be newtargets for combating both fulvestrant resistance and tamoxifen resistance.miR-3188, miR-21, miR-149, and others may be associated with fulvestrantresistance, whereas miR-342 and miR-1226 may be associated with tamoxifenresistance in breast cancer cells. We found differential miRNA profiles betweenfulvestrant-resistant and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, but thedefinite mechanism involved in gaining resistance still needs further study.DOI: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000623 PMID: 29557813
