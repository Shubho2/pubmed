Greece.Transition to menopause is associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, mainly attributed to lipid and glucose metabolism dysregulation, aswell as to body fat redistribution, leading to abdominal obesity. Indeed,epidemiological evidence suggests that both early menopause (EM, defined as ageat menopause <45 years) and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI, defined as age at menopause <40 years) are associated with 1.5-2-fold increase in CVD risk.Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) exerts a favorable effect on CVD risk factors(with subtle differences regarding estrogen dose, route of administration,monotherapy or combination with progestogen and type of progestogen). Concerning CVD morbidity and mortality, most studies have shown a beneficial effect of MHTin women at early menopausal age [<10 years since the final menstrual period(FMP)] or younger than 60 years. MHT is strongly recommended in women with EM andPOI, as these women, if left untreated, are at risk of CVD, osteoporosis,dementia, depression and premature death. MHT has also a favourable benefit/risk profile in perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women, provided that thepatient is not at a high CVD risk (as assessed by 10-year calculation tools).Transdermal estrogens have a lower risk of thrombosis compared with oralregimens. Concerning progestogens, natural progesterone and dydrogesterone has a neutral effect on CVD risk factors. In any case, the decision for MHT should beindividualized, tailored according to the symptoms, patient preference and therisk of CVD, thrombotic episodes and breast cancer.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1570161116666180709095348 PMID: 29984659
