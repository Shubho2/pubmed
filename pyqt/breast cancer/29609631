For each patient, 9 representative points were drawn on the helical CT images of liver segments 1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 6, 7, and 8,respectively, and adaptively deformed to 2 phases of the 4DCT images at the endof inspiration (phase 0 CT) and expiration (phase 50 CT) in the treatmentplanning system. Using the amplitude of each point between phase 0 CT and phase50 CT, we established quantitative data for the respiration-induced motion ofeach liver segment in 3-dimensional directions. Moreover, using the amplitudebetween the original helical CT and both 4DCT images, we rendered the individual segment expansion margin of ITV for hepatic target delineation to cover more than95% of each tumor.RESULTS: The average amplitude (mean ± standard deviation) was 0.6 ± 3.0 mm inthe left-right (LR) direction, 2.3 ± 2.4 mm in the anterior-posterior (AP)direction, and 5.7 ± 3.4 mm in the superior-inferior (SI) direction,respectively. All of the segments moved posteriorly and superiorly duringexpiration. Segment 7 had the largest amplitude in the SI direction, at8.6 ± 3.4 mm. Otherwise, the segments over the lateral side, including segments2, 3, 6, and 7, had greater excursion in the SI direction compared to the medial segments. To cover more than 95% of each tumor, the required expansion margin of ITV in the LR, AP, and SI directions were at least 2.5 mm, 2.5 mm, and 5.0 mm on average, respectively, with variations between different segments.CONCLUSIONS: The greatest excursion occurred in liver segment 7, followed by the segments over the lateral side in the SI direction. The individual segmentexpansion margin of ITV is required to delineate targets for each segment anddirection.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-1007-0 PMCID: PMC5879734PMID: 29609631
