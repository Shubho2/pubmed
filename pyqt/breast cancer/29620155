However, reactivation of Oct3/4expression is observed in several human breast cancer cell lines, but not innon‑malignant cells. To examine Oct3/4 expression in human primary breastcarcinomas and normal breast tissues, we obtained breast tumor tissues from28 patients and normal breast tissues from 9 women. According to quantitativepolymerase chain reaction, all of the tumor tissues, irrespective of tumor typeor clinicopathological status, expressed Oct3/4 mRNA at 10- to 100- fold higherlevels than that in the normal breast tissues. Expression of the Oct3/4 proteinin tumors was confirmed by western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining. Additionally, rapid amplification of cDNA ends and DNA sequencing revealedexpression of multiple Oct4 gene transcripts from chromosome 6 (POU5F1) in normalbreast tissues and the non‑malignant breast epithelial cell line MCF‑10A; bycontrast, the breast tumors and malignant breast cancer cell line MCF‑7predominantly expressed transcripts of an Oct4-like gene (POU5F1B) fromchromosome 8, which was termed Oct3 in the current study. The deduced amino acid sequences of full-length Oct3 and Oct4 are 96% identical. The findings of thecurrent study indicated that Oct3, rather than Oct4, may serve as a novelclinical marker and a potential target for gene-specific therapy of breastcancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4341 PMID: 29620155
