Inflammasomes are oligomeric protein complexes activated in responseto pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecularpatterns (DAMPs). PAMPs and DAMPs are released from infected cells, tumors anddamaged tissues. Inflammasomes activate and release inflammatory cytokines suchas IL-1Î² and IL-18. The various inflammasomes and inflammatory cytokines andchemokines play contrasting roles in cancer development and progression. In this review, we describe the roles of different inflammasomes in lung, breast,gastric, liver, colon, and prostate cancers and in glioblastomas.PMCID: PMC5934549PMID: 29736304
