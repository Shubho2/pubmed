In this 1-year longitudinal study, weaimed at seeking information on the frequency, clinical features, and course ofpainless and painful intercostobrachial neuropathy. We enrolled 40 womenpreviously undergoing breast cancer surgery. In these patients, we collected, at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery, clinical and quantitative sensory testing (QST)variables to diagnose intercostobrachial neuropathy, DN4 questionnaire toidentify neuropathic pain, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory to assess thedifferent neuropathic pain symptoms, the Beck Depression Inventory to assessdepressive symptoms, and SF36 to assess quality of life and Patient GlobalImpression of Change. Clinical and QST examination showed an intercostobrachialneuropathy in 23 patients (57.5%). Out of the 23 patients, five experiencedneuropathic pain, as assessed with clinical examination and DN4. Axillary surgeryclearance was associated with an increased risk of intercostobrachial neuropathy.Whereas sensory disturbances improved during the 1-year observation, neuropathic pain did not. Nevertheless, Beck Depression Inventory, SF36, and the PatientGlobal Impression of Change scores significantly improved over time. Our studyshows that although intercostobrachial neuropathy is a common complication ofbreast cancer surgery, neuropathic pain affects only a minor proportion ofpatients. After 1 year, sensory disturbances partially improve and have only amild impact on mood and quality of life.DOI: 10.1007/s10072-018-3418-y PMID: 29705914
