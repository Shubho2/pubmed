Electronic address: 420306100@qq.com.Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) are both immunosuppressive proteins. Here, we investigated the relationship betweenPD-1 and IDO in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and in tumor-draining lymphnodes (TDLNs) in breast cancer patients. First, the protein and mRNA expressionlevels of PD-1 and IDO in 20 frozen tissues were examined using Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Second, 151 paraffin-embedded breastsamples and 52 lymph node samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Third,correlation and survival data for PD-1 and IDO in 963 breast tumor patients were mined using the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal. We found that the protein expressionlevel of IDO was significantly increased in frozen tumor tissues (P = .005). Fromparaffin-embedded samples in the TME, PD-1+ cells were only located in thestroma, while IDO was expressed in myoepithelial, stromal, and tumor cells. PD-1 and stromal IDO in the TME showed increased expression in tumors (P< .001 and P <.001, respectively). In TDLNs, PD-1+ cells were primarily located in the germinalcenters (GCs), and IDO+ cells were primarily located in the paracortex. Normallymph nodes expressed PD-1 and IDO at the same level as non-metastatic andmetastatic lymph nodes (P = .151 and P = .812, respectively). According tocBioPortal, the correlation analysis showed that IDO and PD-1 had highcorrelation coefficients (r = 0.83). These findings suggest that there is apositive correlation between the expression of PD-1 and IDO and that blockingboth PD-1 and IDO pathways may represent an attractive therapeutic strategy inbreast cancer treatment.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
