We use scientific publication data fromWeb of Science Core Collection and combine bibliometrics and social networkanalysis techniques to identify the most relevant journals, research areas,countries and research organizations in cancer scientific landscape. The results show: Oncotarget as the journal with most publications; a significant increase inChina's publications, reaching United States' publications in 2017; MD CancerCenter, University of California and Harvard University as organizations withmost publications; cell biology as the most frequent research area; breast, lung and colorectal cancer as the most frequent keywords; high density ofco-authorship between organizations in the West, especially in the US, and lowdensity between organizations in Asian and lower and medium income countries. Ourfindings can be used to guide a global knowledge platform guiding policy,planning and funding decisions as well as to establish new institutionalcollaborations.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25730 PMCID: PMC6078146PMID: 30093962
