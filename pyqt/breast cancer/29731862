China.Immunotherapy is currently considered as one of the major anti-tumor modalities, but its efficacy is limited. Dasatinib could improve the expansion andrecruitment of cluster of differentiation (CD) 8+T cells and natural killer (NK) cells to the tumor microenvironment. The present study aimed to evaluate thesynergistic anti-tumor effects of dasatinib with dendritic cell (DC) vaccine inmetastatic breast cancer. Dasatinib with DC vaccine was administered to miceinoculated with 4T1 breast cancer cells. Thereafter, tumor volume was measuredevery other day. On day 34, lung metastasis was assessed with a stereomicroscope.Tumor proliferation and angiogenesis were determined by immunohistochemistry.Apoptosis in tumor tissues was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling. The results showed that although there were nosignificant differences in tumor volumes between the untreated control, DCvaccine and dasatinib groups, the tumor volume was significantly decreased in thecombined treatment group compared to the other three groups. Mice in the combinedtreatment group showed the longest survival time, while mice treated with either single treatment had a slightly increased survival time compared to the untreatedcontrol mice. Additionally, the number of metastatic lung nodules wassignificantly decreased in combined treatment group compared with the dasatinibalone, DC vaccine alone and untreated control groups. Furthermore, the combinedtreatment group showed significantly reduced intratumoral microvessel densitycompared to the other three groups. In addition, the ratios of CD8+ T and NKcells were significantly increased in the combined treatment group compared with the other three groups. These results suggest that dasatinib combined with the DCvaccine is a possible modality for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8188 PMCID: PMC5920940PMID: 29731862
