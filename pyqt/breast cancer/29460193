The survey included questions related to theparticipants' demographics, breast cancer and lymphoedema medical history,prescription and use of compression garments and their beliefs about compression and lymphoedema. Data were analysed using principal component analysis andmultivariable logistic regression.RESULTS: Compression garments had been prescribed to 83% of 201 women withlymphoedema within the last 5 years, although 37 women had discontinued theiruse. Even when accounting for severity of swelling, type of garment(s) and advicegiven for use varied across participants. Use of compression garments was driven by women's beliefs that they were vulnerable to progression of their disease and that compression would prevent its worsening. Common reasons given as to whywomen had discontinued their use included discomfort, and their lymphoedema wasstable. Participant characteristics associated with discontinuance of compressiongarments included their belief that (i) the garments were not effective inmanaging their condition, (ii) experienced mild-moderate swelling and/or (iii)had experienced swelling for greater than 5 years.CONCLUSION: The prescription of compression garments for lymphoedema is highlyvaried and may be due to lack of underpinning evidence to inform treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4093-5 PMID: 29460193
