Electronic address:lrgoulart@ufu.br.Breast Cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease whose most aggressivebehavior is displayed by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which lacks anefficient targeted therapy. Despite its controversial role, one of the proteinsthat having been linked with BC is Annexin A1 (AnxA1), which is a Ca+2 bindingprotein that acts modulating the immune system, cell membrane organization andvesicular trafficking. In this work we analyzed tissue microarrays of BC samples and observed a higher expression of AnxA1 in TNBCs and in lymph node metastasis. We also observed a positive correlation in primary tumors between expressionlevels of AnxA1 and its receptor, FPR1. Despite displaying a lesser strength,this correlation also exists in BC lymph node metastasis. In agreement, we havefound that AnxA1 was highly expressed and secreted in the TNBC cell lineMDA-MB-231 that also expressed high levels of FPR1. Furthermore, we demonstrated,by using the specific FPR1 inhibitor Cyclosporin H (CsH) and theimmunosuppressive drug Cyclosporin A (CsA), the existence of an autocrinesignaling of AnxA1 through the FPR1. Such signaling, elicited by AnxA1 upon itssecretion, increased the aggressiveness and survival of MDA-MB-231 cells. In thismanner, we demonstrated that CsA works very efficiently as an FPR1 inhibitor.Finally, by using CsA, we demonstrated that FPR1 inhibition decreased MDA-MB-231 tumor growth and metastasis formation in nude mice. These results indicate thatFPR1 inhibition could be a potential intervention strategy to manage TNBCsdisplaying the characteristics of MDA-MB-231 cells. FPR1 inhibition can beefficiently achieved by CsA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2018.06.010 PMID: 29932988
