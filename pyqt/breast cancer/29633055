In cancer cells, aberrantubiquitination may promote the activity of oncogenic pathways with subsequenttumour progression. Kelch-like family member 7 (KLHL7) is involved in theregulation of ubiquitination and may play a role in breast cancer (BC). Presentstudy aims to evaluate the biological and clinical usefulness of KLHL7 in BCutilising large well-characterised cohorts with long-term follow-up.METHODS: The relationships between KLHL7 gene copy number alteration (CNA) andmRNA expression and clinicopathological variables and clinical outcomes wereevaluated in 1980 patients from the METABRIC BC cohort. Prognostic significanceof KLHL7 mRNA was validated using the Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner v4.0datasets (n = 5206). KLHL7 protein expression was assessed usingimmunohistochemistry in a large annotated series of early-stage BC (n = 917) withlong-term follow-up.RESULTS: KLHL7 CNA was significantly correlated with its mRNA expression. KLHL7mRNA expression was higher in luminal B and basal-like molecular subtypes and in higher grade tumours. Increased KLHL7 protein expression was significantlycorrelated with features of aggressive phenotype including lymphovascularinvasion, high histological grade, hormonal receptor negativity, high PIK3CA and p53 expression. Outcome analysis showed that high KLHL7 expression is anindependent predictor of shorter survival (p = 0.0011).CONCLUSIONS: KLHL7 appears to play an important role in BC progression. HighKLHL7 protein expression identified a subgroup of BC with aggressive behaviourand provided independent prognostic information.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4777-z PMID: 29633055
