Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical rolesin tumor progression. Here, we identified lncRNA MIR100HG as a pro-oncogene forTNBC progression. Knockdown of MIR100HG decreased cell proliferation and induced cell arrest in the G1 phase, whereas overexpression of MIR100HG significantlyincreased cell proliferation. Furthermore, MIR100HG regulated the p27 gene tocontrol the cell cycle, and subsequently impacted the progression of TNBC. Inanalyzing its underlying mechanism, bioinformatics prediction and experimentaldata demonstrated that MIR100HG participated in the formation of RNA-DNA triplex structures. MIR100HG in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and breast cancer celllines showed higher expression in TNBC than in other tumor types with poorprognosis. In conclusion, our data indicated a novel working pattern of lncRNA inTNBC progression, which may be a potential therapeutic target in such cancers.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0869-2 PMCID: PMC6057987PMID: 30042378
