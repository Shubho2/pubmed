[Epub ahead of print]MAC30 knockdown involved in the activation of the Hippo signaling pathway inbreast cancer cells.Song GQ(1), Zhao Y(1).Author information: (1)Department of Breast Surgery, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, 36 Sanhao Street, Heping District, Shenyang, Liaoning 110004, P.R.China.Down-regulation of the meningioma-associated protein (MAC30) gene has been found in many solid cancers. This study was carried out to determine the roles and the mechanisms of MAC30 in breast cancer. We used our own data and a public database to analyze the MAC30 mRNA and protein levels in breast cancer tissues. Inaddition, we established MAC30 knockdown breast cancer cells using MAC30 siRNA.The roles of MAC30 were detected by using the Soft agar assay, Annexin-V-FITC/PI double staining and the Transwell assay. Western blotting was used to analyze thepotential mechanism(s) of MAC30 in these cells. We found that MAC30 mRNA andprotein were higher in the cancer tissues compared to the matched normal tissues.MAC30 expression was associated with tumor size, tumor differentiation andestrogen receptor (ER) status. Overall survival rate of the patients with lowMAC30 expression was obviously higher than the ones with high expression. Theapoptotic ratio was lower in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells with MAC30expression. By Western blot analysis, we found that increased levels ofphosphorylated YAP1, MST1 and LATS1 after MAC30 siRNA transfection in these twocells. In summary, we demonstrate that MAC30 knockdown is involved in theactivation of the Hippo signaling pathway.DOI: 10.1515/hsz-2018-0250 PMID: 29990302
