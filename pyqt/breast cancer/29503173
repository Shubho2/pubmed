The requirement for informed consent was waived. A total of 195consecutive newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer patients (age 33-83 years;mean 54.0 years) with preoperative breast US with SWS measurement of the lesionwere identified. They underwent surgery between May 2012 and May 2013. SWS wasmeasured at the center and three marginal zones in the main tumors, and themaximum value was used for analyses. For 35 patients who underwent primarysystemic therapy (PST), the maximum SWS before PST was used. Cox proportionalhazards modeling was used to identify the relationship betweenclinical-pathologic factors and disease-free survival.RESULTS: Fourteen recurrences occurred at 6-47 months (mean 22.3 months) aftersurgery. On multivariate analysis, a positive history of PST (hazard ratio[HR] = 4.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.66, 14.70; P = .004), adjuvantchemotherapy (HR = 3.67; 95% CI: 1.11, 12.1; P = .033), and higher maximum SWS(HR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.23; P = .020) were associated with poorerdisease-free survival.CONCLUSION: Higher maximum SWS on preoperative US, in addition to a positivehistory of PST and adjuvant chemotherapy, was significantly associated withpoorer disease-free survival of patients with invasive breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.
