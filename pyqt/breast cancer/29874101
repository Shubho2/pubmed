Active immunotherapyusing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted vaccinesrepresents an attractive option in combating breast cancer. DifferentHER2-derived vaccines have been developed over the years. Many clinical trialshave been carried out in evaluating HER2-based vaccines. The authors reviewedcurrent literature on HER2-based vaccines in clinical trials. The trials covered in this mini-review represent some of the major trials published in the past 20years regarding the clinical use and test of HER2 vaccines. Their focus is ontrials using HER2 peptide vaccines as the majority of clinical trials initiatedor published used HER2 peptide-based vaccines. Findings from combination therapy trials of HER2 peptide vaccines with other treatment modalities are alsopresented.DOI: 10.1089/cbr.2017.2327 PMID: 29874101
