We addressed a questionnaire to the data managers of theEUSOMA breast centers network in order to acquire information with regard totheir education, training, role, activity, recognition, and satisfaction. Breast centers' data managers are highly educated individuals with a variety ofbackgrounds carrying out, more frequently part-time and as temporary employees, ajob for which they received little specific training.
