Promyelocytic leukemia(PML) gene produces several isoforms due to alternative splicing; however, thebiological function of each specific isoform has yet to be identified. In thisstudy, we report a previously unknown role for PMLIV, the most intensely studied nuclear isoform, in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling-associated EMTand migration in breast cancer. This study demonstrates that PMLIV overexpressionpromotes a more aggressive mesenchymal phenotype and increases the migration ofMCF-7 cancer cells. This event is associated with activation of the TGF-βcanonical signaling pathway through the induction of Smad2/3 phosphorylation and the translocation of phospho-Smad2/3 to the nucleus. In this study, we report apreviously unknown role for PMLIV in TGF-β signaling-induced regulation of breastcancer-associated EMT and migration. Targeting this pathway may betherapeutically beneficial.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26862 PMID: 29943817
