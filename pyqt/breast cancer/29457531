RhoA signalling is critical to many cellular processesincluding migration, mechanotransduction, and is often disrupted incarcinogenesis. Investigating RhoA activity in a native tissue environment ischallenging using conventional biochemical methods; we therefore developed aRhoA-FRET biosensor mouse, employing the adaptable nature of intravital imagingto a variety of settings. Mechanotransduction was explored in the context ofosteocyte processes embedded in the calvaria responding in a directional mannerto compression stress. Further, the migration of neutrophils was examined during in vivo "chemotaxis" in wound response. RhoA activity was tightly regulatedduring tissue remodelling in mammary gestation, as well as during mammary andpancreatic carcinogenesis. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of RhoA wastemporally resolved by the use of optical imaging windows in fully developedpancreatic and mammary tumours in vivo. The RhoA-FRET mouse therefore constitutesa powerful tool to facilitate development of new inhibitors targeting the RhoAsignalling axis.DOI: 10.1080/21541248.2018.1438024 PMID: 29457531
