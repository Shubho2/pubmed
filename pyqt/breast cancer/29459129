Electronic address:ahmedkamal@iict.res.in.A series of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-benzimidazole conjugates were synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against four human cancer celllines i.e.; HeLa (cervical), A549 (lung), MCF-7 (breast) and DU-145 (prostate)along with normal HEK-293 cell line. Amongst them, conjugate 6d displayedsignificant cytotoxicity against human lung cancer cell line, A549 with IC50value 1.08 µM. Further, cell cycle analysis revealed that this compound arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase in A549 cells. Furthermore, the tubulinpolymerization assay results suggest that this conjugate (6d) exhibitssignificant inhibitory effect on the tubulin assembly with an IC50 value of1.68 µM. Moreover, the apoptotic inducing properties of compound 6d was confirmedby Hoechst staining, measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) andannexin V-FITC assay. Further, molecular docking studies revealed that compound6d occupied the colchicine binding site.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bioorg.2018.02.005 PMID: 29459129
