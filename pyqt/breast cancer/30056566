Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin areeffective chemotherapeutic agents for which dosing is limited by development ofcardiotoxicity. Our published evidence shows that targeting CD47 enhancesradiation-induced growth delay of tumors while remarkably protecting softtissues. The protection of cell viability observed with CD47 is mediatedautonomously by activation of protective autophagy. However, whether CD47protects cancer cells from cytotoxic chemotherapy is unknown.METHODS: We tested the effect of CD47 blockade on cancer cell survival using a2-dimensional high-throughput cell proliferation assay in 4T1 breast cancer cell lines. To evaluate blockade of CD47 in combination with chemotherapy in vivo, we employed the 4T1 breast cancer model and examined tumor and cardiac tissueviability as well as autophagic flux.RESULTS: Our high-throughput screen revealed that blockade of CD47 does notinterfere with the cytotoxic activity of anthracyclines against 4T1 breast cancercells. Targeting CD47 enhanced the effect of doxorubicin chemotherapy in vivo by reducing tumor growth and metastatic spread by activation of an anti-tumor innateimmune response. Moreover, systemic suppression of CD47 protected cardiac tissue viability and function in mice treated with doxorubicin.CONCLUSIONS: Our experiments indicate that the protective effects observed withCD47 blockade are mediated through upregulation of autophagic flux. However, the absence of CD47 in did not elicit a protective effect in cancer cells, but itenhanced macrophage-mediated cancer cell cytolysis. Therefore, the differentialresponses observed with CD47 blockade are due to autonomous activation ofprotective autophagy in normal tissue and enhancement immune cytotoxicity againstcancer cells.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4884-x PMID: 30056566
