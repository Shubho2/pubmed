Closeinteractions between cancer cells and stroma are known to regulate several cancerpathways and thus the determination of different tumor-stromal interactions couldbe an important step in invasiveness. The breast cancer microenvironment is acomplex combination of several different cell types and molecules and a keycontributor to tumor development and progression. The microenvironment includesfibroblasts, macrophages, immune cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes,endothelial cells and angiogenic vascular cells, whereas stromal cells surroundand interact with tumor cells. Recent data demonstrate significant geneexpression alterations in microenvironment cells during disease progression andseveral stromal cell types are implicated in promoting the "hallmarks of cancer",which can be explored as targets for cancer therapy. Besides identifying newtherapeutic targets, the microenvironment has also been implicated inchemotherapy resistance, suggesting that the crosstalk between cancer and itsmicroenvironment is a promising strategy to target breast cancer.DOI: 10.14670/HH-18-021 PMID: 29978449
