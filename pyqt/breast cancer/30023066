However,the influence of prior cancer on survival outcomes of current pancreatic cancerremains unclear.Methods: Eligible populations were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results programs from 2000 to 2012. We adopted Kaplan-Meier curves andCox analysis to compare survival differences between patients with and withoutprior cancer.Results: Overall, 67,555 pancreatic cancer patients, including 5582 (8.26%) with and 61,973 (91.74%) without prior cancer, were included. The most common types ofprior cancers were prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers. The median time fromdiagnosis of an initial malignancy to subsequent pancreatic cancer was 59.8months. Patients with a prior cancer had higher overall one-year and three-yearsurvival rates compared with those without a prior cancer. Multivariable Coxanalysis demonstrated that a history of prior malignancy could independentlypredict the better overall survival outcome of pancreatic cancer (HR = 0.92, 95% CI, 0.89-0.94, p < 0.001), especially for colorectal, breast, corpus uteri andprostate cancer survivors.Conclusions: A history of cancer did not contribute to a poor survival outcomefor patients with pancreatic cancer. More prospective trials might be warrantedto validate our findings.DOI: 10.1177/2050640618765505 PMCID: PMC6047279PMID: 30023066
