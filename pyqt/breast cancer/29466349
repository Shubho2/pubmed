Thisstudy investigated the information requirements of young women to support theirtreatment decision making at diagnosis. .PARTICIPANTS &AMP; SETTING: A purposeful sample of 20 women diagnosed with breastcancer aged 40 years or younger who had undergone surgery and had participated ina large cohort study in the United Kingdom. .METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: Audio recordings of semistructured interviews were used toreveal information received at the time of surgical treatment. .FINDINGS: Themes identified were types of breast cancer, surgical treatments,nonsurgical treatments, fertility, and surgery and after surgery. Participantsfelt that information required throughout treatment was influenced by individual life circumstances, such as children or plans for children, relationships, andcareer intentions. Participants felt information was lacking on the effects oftreatment on body image, reconstructive surgery, and genetic predisposition tobreast cancer. .IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Knowledge of the information requirements of youngwomen diagnosed with breast cancer allows nursing staff to provide tailoredsupport at times identified as most useful.DOI: 10.1188/18.ONF.165-175 PMID: 29466349
