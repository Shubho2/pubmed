This study examined whether chemotherapy preference was associated with toxicity, efficacy, quality of life (QoL), and functional outcomes duringand after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy in older women with breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of CALGB 49907, arandomized trial that compared standard adjuvant chemotherapy versus capecitabinein patients age 65 years or older with breast cancer. A subset of 145 patientscompleted a questionnaire to describe chemotherapy preference pre-treatment. The association of this pre-treatment preference with the patient's perception ofself-health, predicted and actual QoL, patient- and professional-reportedtoxicity, mental health, self-rated function, and survival was studied during andafter treatment.RESULTS: The median age of patients was 71 years and 47% had a high preferencefor chemotherapy. On baseline demographics, the low preference group had a higherproportion of white patients (95% vs. 78%, p = 0.004). Before treatment, lowchemotherapy preference was associated with greater nausea/vomiting (p = 0.008). Mid-treatment, low preference was associated with lower QoL, worse social,emotional and physical function (all p ≤ 0.02) and worse nausea/vomiting, cancer symptoms and financial worries (all p < 0.05). The association notedmid-treatment, resolved after treatment completion except with financial worries which persisted at 24 months. Low preference was associated with higher rates of grade 3-5 adverse events (53% vs. 34%, p = 0.02) but was not associated withsurvival.CONCLUSIONS: Low chemotherapy preference prior to treatment initiation wasassociated with lower QoL, worse physical symptoms and self-rated function andmore adverse events mid-treatment. There is no association of chemotherapypreference with survival.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
