MBI showed Tstage migration in 26 patients (9%), with frequent detection of in situ carcinomaaround the tumor. Surgical management was adjusted in 14 of these patients (54%).In 17 of 287 patients (6%), MBI revealed 21 proven additional lesions in theipsilateral, contralateral breast or both. In 18 of these additional foci (86%), detected in 15 patients, malignancy was found. Thirteen of these 15 patients had ipsilateral cancer and 2 patients bilateral malignancy. In total, MBI revealed a larger tumor extent, additional tumor foci or both in 40 patients (14%), leading to treatment adjustment in 25 patients (9%).CONCLUSION: MBI seems to be a useful imaging modality with a high predictivevalue in revealing ipsilateral and bilateral disease not visualized bymammography and ultrasound. It may play an important role in delineating theextent of the index lesion during preoperative planning. Incorporation of MBI in the clinical work-up as an adjunct modality to mammography and ultrasound maylead to better selection of patients who could benefit from BCS.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4706-1 PMCID: PMC5953986PMID: 29435855
