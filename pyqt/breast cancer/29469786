Clinically it is similar toPaget disease of the breast, appearing as red, well-demarcated eczematoidlesions, with slightly raised edges. A high degree of clinical suspicion is very important when evaluating these lesions in order to avoid misdiagnosis and delay of effective treatment. We present a case of vulvar Paget disease treated withvulvectomy.PMID: 29469786  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
