These factors transcriptionally activate genes that allow cells to adapt to hypoxia. In cancers, hypoxia and HIFs have beenassociated with increased invasion, metastasis, and resistance to chemo andradiation therapy. Here we have characterized the metabolic consequences ofsilencing HIF-1α and HIF-2α singly or combined in MDA-MB-231 triple negativehuman breast cancer xenografts, using non-invasive proton magnetic resonancespectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) of in vivo tumors, and high-resolution 1H MRS of tumor extracts. Tumors from all three sublines showed a significant reduction of growth rate. We identified new metabolic targets of HIF, and demonstrated thedivergent consequences of silencing HIF-1α and HIF-2α individually on some ofthese targets. These data expand our understanding of the metabolic pathwaysregulated by HIFs that may provide new insights into the adaptive metabolicresponse of cancer cells to hypoxia. Such insights may lead to novel metabolismbased therapeutic targets for triple negative breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24569 PMCID: PMC5880607PMID: 29632647
