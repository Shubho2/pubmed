The aim of the present study was to developpaclitaxel hybrid nanomicelles for oral administration to treat resistant breast cancer.Methods: Evaluations were performed on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells,drug-resistant breast cancer MCF-7/Adr cells, and in MCF-7/Adr-xenografted BALB/cnude mice. The nanomicelles were composed of the polymer soluplus, d-Î±-tocopherylpolyethyleneglycol 1000 succinate (TPGS1000), and dequalinium (DQA). Theconstructed paclitaxel hybrid nanomicelles were ~65 nm in size.Results: The nanomicelles improved cellular uptake and anticancer efficacy in theresistant breast cancer cells and induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Themechanism of the apoptosis-inducing effect was related to the co-localization of the nanomicelles with mitochondria; the activation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, cytochrome C, and apoptotic enzymes caspase 9 and 3; and the inhibition ofanti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Oral administration of paclitaxel hybridnanomicelles had the same anticancer efficacy as the intravenous injection oftaxol in resistant breast cancer-bearing mice. The oral suitability of thisformulation was associated with the nanostructure and the actions of TPGS1000 andDQA.Conclusion: The fabricated paclitaxel hybrid nanomicelles could provide apromising oral formulation to treat drug-resistant breast cancer.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S150140 PMCID: PMC5799853PMID: 29440897  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
