This study was conducted to assess the immunoexpression of P63 and SOX2in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and to evaluate the predictivediagnostic value of these markers for specific types of TNBC. Methods:Histological slides and paraffin blocks of TNBC cases were collected from Dr.Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia from 5-years period (2011-2015). Each histological slide was subjected to immunohistochemical staining for P63 (nucleusand cytoplasm) and SOX2 (nucleus), with specific primer antibodies.Immunoexpression of P63 and SOX2 was evaluated using immunoreactivity scoring.Associations between P63 and SOX2 immunoexpression and TNBC types were assessedusing Mann Whitney tests. In addition, the predictive diagnostic values of these markers were assessed. Results: Forty TNBC histological slides were included, and23 (57.5%) were Basal-like type TNBC and 17 (42.5%) were Non basal-like typeTNBC. Immunoexpression of P63 nucleus and SOX2 was not different between types ofTNBC. However, immunoexpression of P63 in the cytoplasm in Basal-like type TNBCwas significantly higher than in Non basal-like type TNBC ( p=0.021). Predictordiagnostic value analysis suggested that immunoexpression of P63 in cytoplasm had56.5% sensitivity and 70.6% specificity for diagnosing Basal-like type TNBC, witharea under curve of 0.64.    Conclusions: Immunoexpression of P63 in thecytoplasm has a relatively weak diagnostic value to discriminate Basal-like andNon basal-like types of TNBC.DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.12671.2 PMCID: PMC5820604PMID: 29527291
