The expression levels ofIGF-1 and ERK in MS patients with CRC were higher while expression levels ofGLUT4 were lower compared to MS patients without CRC (P< 0.01). Expression levelsof ERK, IGF-1, GLUT4 were associated with clinical characteristics of CRC,including tumor size, distant metastasis and advanced stages (III/IV) (P< 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Expressions of IGF-1, ERK and GLUT4 in greater omental adiposetissues might be useful biomarkers and predictive targets in the diagnosis ofCRC.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-170942 PMID: 29504525
