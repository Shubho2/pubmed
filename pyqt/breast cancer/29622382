Radiation dermatitis has a significant impact onquality of life and can result in treatment interruptions or cessation. Thepurpose of this study was to prospectively follow breast radiation dermatitis anddetermine trends including peak toxicity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Upon initiation of RT treatment, to assess skin reaction,each patient was seen weekly by the healthcare team, or contacted via telephoneto assess patient-reported symptoms. Weekly progression of radiation dermatitiswas assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE),version 4.03. Patients were stratified for analysis of radiation dermatitis basedon RT technique and dosage.RESULTS: A total of 148 patients with 2 or more skin assessments were analyzed.The majority of patients received 2-field tangential RT (64.2%) with a dose of5000 cGy in 25 fractions. Overall, patients experienced the most Grade 2 CTCAEtoxicity (61.9%) 2 weeks after completion of RT; Grade 3 toxicity also peaked at this time (8.3%). Regardless of stratification by RT technique or by dosage ofRT, Grade 2 and 3 toxicities consistently peaked at 1 or 2 weeks after RT.CONCLUSIONS: Breast radiation dermatitis appears to peak approximately 2 weeksafter RT. Treatment factors such as technique or dosing regimen do not appear to have a substantial effect on radiation dermatitis, but our study was limited bysmall sample size. This study provides additional evidence that radiationdermatitis should continue to be followed closely, especially in the 2 weeksfollowing RT.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
