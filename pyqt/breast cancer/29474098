Dose prescription was 50 Gy. Plans werecompared in terms of doses to the planning target volume, organs at risk and the homogeneity index. The non-parametric Friedman test for paired data and theConover post hoc analysis were used for data analysis.RESULTS: HT provided the highest D90 and D98% and the lowest HI, V107% and D2%.HT was associated with the lowest D2% and V25 Gy to the heart in left-sidedtreatments but the mean cardiac dose was highest. HT provided the highest V5 Gyand V20 Gy to the ipsilateral lung, but the V30 Gy was lower. The contralateralbreast and lung were more exposed with HT.CONCLUSION: The present dosimetric study together with daily use of CT-MV imageguided RT have led us to opt for HT after mastectomy and breast reconstructionand to draw up a suitable protocol for treating the chest wall and levels III andIV draining nodes. Advances in knowledge: HT is a suitable for treating the chestwall and levels III and IV draining nodes.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20160874 PMID: 29474098  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
