We assessed psychosocial needs and correlates in women initiating testing for highgenetic BC risk in clinics in France and Germany, and compared these results withdata from a literature review. Among the 442 counselees consecutively approached,212 (83%) in France and 180 (97%) in Germany, mostly BC patients (81% and 92%,respectively), returned the 'Psychosocial Assessment in Hereditary Cancer'questionnaire. Based on the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) BC risk estimation model, the mean BClifetime risk estimates were 19% and 18% in France and Germany, respectively. In both countries, the most prevalent needs clustered around the "living withcancer" and "children-related issues" domains. In multivariate analyses, a highernumber of psychosocial needs were significantly associated with younger age (b = -0.05), higher anxiety (b = 0.78), and having children (b = 1.51), but not withcountry, educational level, marital status, depression, or loss of a familymember due to hereditary cancer. These results are in line with the literaturereview data. However, this review identified only seven studies thatquantitatively addressed psychosocial needs in the BC genetic counseling setting.Current data lack understandings of how cancer risk counseling affectspsychosocial needs, and improves patient-centered care in that setting.DOI: 10.3390/ijerph15020319 PMCID: PMC5858388PMID: 29439543
