TNBC patients usually have shorter survival time afterdiagnosis of brain metastasis, suggesting an innate ability of TNBC tumor cellsin adapting to the brain. In this study, we establish novel animal models toinvestigate early tumor adaptation in brain metastases by introducing bothpatient-derived and cell line-derived CSC-enriched brain metastasis tumorspherecells into mice. We discovered astrocyte-involved tumor activation ofprotocadherin 7 (PCDH7)-PLCβ-Ca2+-CaMKII/S100A4 signaling as a mediator of brain metastatic tumor outgrowth. We further identified and evaluated the efficacy of aknown drug, the selective PLC inhibitor edelfosine, in suppressing the PCDH7signaling pathway to prohibit brain metastases in the animal models. The results of this study reveal a novel signaling pathway for brain metastases in TNBC andindicate a promising strategy of metastatic breast cancer prevention andtreatment by targeting organ-adaptive cancer stem cells.Significance: Thesefindings identify a compound to block adaptive signaling between cancer stemcells and brain astrocytes.
