The common method fortreating cancer (especially BC) is applying a single anticancer agent, however,due to some disadvantages including cytotoxicity, side effects, and multidrugresistance, the efficiency and application of this method are limited. Toovercome these challenges, the combinational delivery of anticancer drugs(including chemical agents, genetic materials, etc.) has been introduced. Toincrease the efficacy of this new method, several nanocarriers includinginorganic nanoparticles (such as, magnetic nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles,etc.) and organic ones (e.g., dendrimers, liposomes, micelles, and polymericnanoparticles) have been used. Based on the literature, combinational deliveryusing nanocarriers showed promising results in the treatment of BC. In thisreview, combination regimens for the treatment of BC, nanocarriers containingcombinations of pharmaceutical agents (including small molecule chemotherapeutic,biological, and gene therapy agents) as an opportunity to overcome chemotherapychallenges and, finally, examples of these formulations have been presented. Thisreview aims to provide a better understanding of these increasingly important newmethods of cancer treatment and the main issues and key considerations for arational design of nanocarriers used in combinational delivery of differentsynergistic anticancer agents. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
