In this study, we evaluate theeffectiveness of a comprehensive, lifestyle medicine intervention, Lifestyle180®, on chronic disease risk factors and quality of life in cancer survivors.DESIGN: Retrospective subgroup analysis of a clinical program.SETTINGS/LOCATION: An outpatient medical facility.SUBJECTS: Lifestyle 180 participants with a diagnosis of past cancer.INTERVENTION: Sixty-four hours of intensive nutrition, culinary medicine,physical activity, and stress relief practices over a 6-month period, with 9- and12-month follow-up.OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre-postanalysis (baseline vs. 12 months) included biometrics: weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and blood pressure; standard laboratory tests: lipids, C-reactive protein, fasting insulin/glucose, andinsulin resistance; and empirically validated questionnaires: perceived stress,depression, and quality of life.RESULTS: Fifty-eight cancer survivors participated in Lifestyle 180. Average age was 63 years, roughly 75% of participants were female, and the greatest majority had a diagnosis of breast, prostate, or skin cancer. Diagnosis of hyperlipidemia,hypertension, diabetes, and prediabetes presented in 47%, 57%, 22%, and 50% ofpatients, respectively. Forty-five percent of patients were obese, 24% wereoverweight, and 16% were depressed. At 12 months, participants lost an average of14 pounds (-6.6%, p < 0.001) and 2.6 inches off their waist (-5.9%, p < 0.001).BMI decreased significantly by an average of 2.4 kg/m2 (-6.8%, p < 0.001).Significant decreases from well-managed baseline levels also occurred in mostmeasured biomarkers (average change: high-density lipoprotein +3.3 mg/dL,p < 0.05; triglycerides -23.0 mg/dL, p < 0.01; C-reactive protein -1.3 mg/L,p < 0.01; fasting insulin -4.2 μU/mL, p < 0.05; and homeostasis modelassessment-insulin resistance -1.5, p < 0.01; n = 40). Changes in psychosocialvariables included significant improvements in perceived stress (-20%, p < 0.01) and quality of life (+54%, p < 0.001). We were unable to detect a difference indepressive symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors participating in a comprehensive intervention couldemploy the prescribed lifestyle modifications to produce clinically relevanthealth and quality-of-life benefits. These data support the American CancerSociety (ACS) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommendations toincorporate healthy lifestyle modifications into long-term cancer survivorshipcare.DOI: 10.1089/acm.2018.0193 PMID: 30067063
