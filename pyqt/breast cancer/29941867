We previously linked fourmicroRNAs to breast cancer prognosis. One of these microRNAs, hsa-miR-7, wasfound to be regulated by another type of ncRNA, the circular non-coding RNA(circRNA) CDR1-AS, which contains multiple hsa-miR-7 binding sites. Based on thisfinding, we studied the potential clinical value of this circRNA on breast cancerprognosis in a cohort based on a cohort that was previously analysed forhsa-miR-7 and in an adjuvant hormone-na√Øve cohort for 1st-line tamoxifentreatment outcomes, in which we also analysed hsa-miR-7. A negative correlationwas observed between hsa-miR-7 and CDR1-AS in both cohorts. Despite associations with various clinical metrics (e.g., tumour grade, tumour size, and relapselocation), CDR1-AS was neither prognostic nor predictive of relevant outcomes in our cohorts. However, we did observe stromal CDR1-AS expression, suggesting apossible cell-type specific interaction. Next to the known association ofhsa-miR-7 expression with poor prognosis in primary breast cancer, we found that high hsa-miR-7 expression was predictive of an adverse response to tamoxifentherapy and poor progression-free and post-relapse overall survival in patientswith recurrent disease.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27987-w PMCID: PMC6018428PMID: 29941867
