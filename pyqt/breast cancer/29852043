[Epub ahead of print]Effect of Adjuvant Trastuzumab for a Duration of 9 Weeks vs 1 Year WithConcomitant Chemotherapy for Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor2-Positive Breast Cancer: The SOLD Randomized Clinical Trial.Joensuu H(1), Fraser J(2), Wildiers H(3), Huovinen R(4), Auvinen P(5), Utriainen M(1), Nyandoto P(6), Villman KK(7), Halonen P(1), Granstam-Björneklett H(8),Lundgren L(9), Sailas L(10)(11), Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T(12), Tanner M(13),Yachnin J(14), Ritchie D(2), Johansson O(15), Huttunen T(16), Neven P(3), Canney P(2), Harvey VJ(17), Kellokumpu-Lehtinen PL(13), Lindman H(18).Author information: (1)Department of Oncology, Helsinki University Hospital and University ofHelsinki, Helsinki, Finland.(2)Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, Glasgow, United Kingdom.(3)University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.(4)Department of Oncology, Turku University Central Hospital, Turku, Finland.(5)Department of Oncology, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.(6)Päijät-Häme Central Hospital, Lahti, Finland.(7)Örebro University Hospital, Örebro, Sweden.(8)Västerås Central Hospital, Västerås, Sweden.(9)Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.(10)Vaasa Central Hospital, Vaasa, Finland.(11)North Carelia Central Hospital, Joensuu, Finland.(12)Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu,Finland.(13)Department of Oncology, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.(14)Eskilstuna Hospital, Eskilstuna, Sweden.(15)Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland.(16)4Pharma, Turku, Finland.(17)Auckland City Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand.(18)Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.Importance: Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive earlybreast cancer. While the standard duration of trastuzumab treatment is 12 months,the benefits and harms of trastuzumab continued beyond the chemotherapy areunclear.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant trastuzumab continued beyond chemotherapy in women treated with up-front chemotherapy containing ataxane and trastuzumab.Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, randomized (1:1) clinical trialincluding women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Chemotherapy was identical inthe 2 groups, consisting of 3 cycles of 3-weekly docetaxel (either 80 or 100mg/m2) plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles of fluorouracil,epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Thereafter, no trastuzumab was administered in the 9-week group, whereas controls received trastuzumab to complete 1 year ofadministration. Disease-free survival (DFS) was compared between the groups usinga Cox model and the noninferiority approach. The estimated sample size was 2168patients (1-sided testing, with a relative noninferiority margin of 1.3). FromJanuary 3, 2008, to December 16, 2014, 2176 patients were accrued from 7countries.Intervention: Docetaxel plus trastuzumab for 9 weeks, followed by 3 cycles offluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide in both groups. Controls continuedtrastuzumab to 1 year.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary objective was DFS; secondary objectivesincluded distant disease-free survival, overall survival, cardiac DFS, andsafety.Results: In the 2174 women analyzed, median age was 56 (interquartile range[IQR], 48-64) years. The median follow-up was 5.2 (IQR, 3.8-6.7) years.Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (hazard ratio, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12-1.72). Distant disease-free survival andoverall survival did not differ substantially between the groups. Thirty-six (3%)and 21 (2%) patients in the 1-year and the 9-week groups, respectively, hadcardiac failure; the left ventricle ejection fraction was better maintained inthe 9-week group. An interaction was detected between the docetaxel dose and DFS;patients in the 9-week group treated with 80 mg/m2 had inferior and those treatedwith 100 mg/m2 had similar DFS as patients in the 1-year group.Conclusions and Relevance: Nine weeks of trastuzumab was not noninferior to 1year of trastuzumab when given with similar chemotherapy. Cardiac safety wasbetter in the 9-week group. The docetaxel dosing with trastuzumab requiresfurther study.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00593697.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1380 PMID: 29852043
