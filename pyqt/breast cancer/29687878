In the lasttwenty years early diagnosis, neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic treatment thattargeted to specific molecular targets have significantly reduced the mortalityfrom breast cancer. However, the increase in survival has allowed to observe the cardiotoxic effects of anticancer therapy and increased mortality fromcardiovascular causes, resulting in a large literature where experts try toidentify the correct management of this critical problem. Even thought theincreased attention in this field, many questions have not yet answers and newstudies are needed.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a broad search of the English-languageliterature in Medline using the following search terms: cardiotoxicity,anthracyclines, trastuzumab, breast cancer, left ventricular dysfunction, heartfailure. A manual examination of the articles found has been performed.RESULTS: We provide a comprehensive assessment of the current knowledge aboutcardiotoxicity induced by anthracycline plus trastuzumab in women affected bybreast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Early identification and prompt treatment of subclinicalcardiotoxicity may improve cardiologic prognosis of these patients and may allow oncologists to avoid withdrawal of chemotherapy. That is why it becomes alwaysmore important the creation of multidisciplinary teams where cardiologists andoncologists work together to ensure optimal care to oncologic patients treatedwith cardiotoxic agents.PMID: 29687878
