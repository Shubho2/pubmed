Email: suhailymh@usm.myBackground: Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease and the leadingcause of cancer death among women globally. This study aimed to determine themedian survival time and prognostic factors for breast cancer patients in aNorth-East State of Malaysia. Methods: This retrospective cohort study wasconducted from January till April 2017 using secondary data obtained from thestateâ€™s cancer registry. All 549 cases of breast cancer diagnosed from 1stJanuary 2007 until 31st December 2011 were selected and retrospectivelyfollowed-up until 31st December 2016. Sociodemographic and clinical informationwas collected to determine prognostic factors. Results: The average (SD) age atdiagnosis was 50.4 (11.2) years, the majority of patients having Malay ethnicity (85.8%) and a histology of ductal carcinoma (81.5%). Median survival times forthose presenting at stages III and IV were 50.8 (95% CI: 25.34, 76.19) and 6.9(95% CI: 3.21, 10.61) months, respectively. Ethnicity (Adj. HR for Malay vsnon-Malay ethnicity=2.52; 95% CI: 1.54, 4.13; p<0.001), stage at presentation(Adj. HR for Stage III vs Stage I=2.31; 95% CI: 1.57, 3.39; p<0.001 and Adj. HRfor Stage IV vs Stage I=6.20; 95% CI: 4.45, 8.65; p<0.001), and history ofsurgical treatment (Adj. HR for patients with no surgical intervention=1.95; 95% CI: 1.52, 2.52; p<0.001) were observed to be the statistically significantprognostic factors associated with death caused by breast cancer. Conclusion: Themedian survival time among breast cancer patients in North-East State of Malaysiawas short as compared to other studies. Primary and secondary prevention aimed atearly diagnosis and surgical management of breast cancer, particularly among the Malay ethnic group, could improve treatment outcome.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.2.497 PMCID: PMC5980940PMID: 29480991
