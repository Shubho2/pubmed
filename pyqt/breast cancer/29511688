However, studies in breast cancer patients are rare.Objective: To analyze 200 patient set-ups in 20 patients with breast cancer bycomparing the OSMS with the conventional cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).Method: Displacements from concurrent OSMS and CBCT registrations were comparedin a total of 200 setups of 20 patients to analyze the interfractionaldisplacement and positioning displacement in three dimensions (lateral,longitudinal, and vertical directions).Results: The interfractional displacement on the lateral, longitudinal, andvertical directions for OSMS versus CBCT was 0.049 ± 0.254 versus 0.041 ± 0.244centimeters (cm); 0.018 ± 0.261 versus 0.040 ± 0.242 cm; 0.062 ± 0.254 versus0.065 ± 0.240 cm, respectively, without any significant difference (all P >0.05). The duration for CBCT scan was about 60 seconds (s), while that for image processing, matching, and couch displacement was at least 5 minutes (min). Theaverage scanning time with OSMS was less than 20 s, and the total duration forpositioning was less than 1 min.Conclusion: OSMS is an efficient tool to improve the accuracy and increase thespeed for verifying the patient positioning in radiotherapy for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6415497 PMCID: PMC5817315PMID: 29511688
