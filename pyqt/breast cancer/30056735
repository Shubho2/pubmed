For a good death, patients consider fivefactors important: managing physical symptoms, avoiding a useless prolongation ofdying, having good self-esteem, relieving burdens on the family, and deepeningties with loved ones. Four out of those 5 are accomplished by the implementation of advance care planning (ACP). ACP is not simply a formal writing of a patient'spreferences about end-of-life treatment, but it is a process of communicationbetween a patient, their family and care providers. There are few studies on ACP for patients with metastatic breast cancer. However, data on seriously illpatients support ACP's favorable effects on end of life care outcomes for notonly patients, but family members and care providers as well. The observed keysto success for ACP were trained facilitators, education of the medical staff,inclusion of family and surrogate members, and a system to support ACP. ACPshould be regarded as a standard of care to improve the quality of life ofpatients with metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.21037/cco.2018.06.03 PMID: 30056735
