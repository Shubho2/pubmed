China.RATIONALE: Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is an immune-mediatedneurological deficit affecting the cerebellum. Anti-Yo antibody positive PCD is arare occurrence most likely associated with gynecologic or breast malignancies.The identification of the underlying tumor is a diagnostic challenge in many ofthese patients.PATIENT CONCERNS: We present a 68-year-old woman with acute symptoms of PCD as a first sign of underlying occult malignancy. Further investigation revealed apositive anti-Yo antibody. Although brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) wasunremarkable, positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)revealed intense hypermetabolism of cerebellum and diffused hypometabolism in therest of brain. On 1-year follow-up, despite the primary malignancy is stillunknown, her symptoms improved significantly after immunotherapy.DIAGNOSES: Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.INTERVENTIONS: The patient was given IV methylprednisolone 500 mg once a day for 5 consecutive days, followed by oral prednisone 60 mg once a day for 3 months.OUTCOMES: The patient's symptoms were gradually improved during thehospitalization period. On one year follow up, she was able to walk independentlyand perform some simple tasks.LESSONS: Cerebellar hypermetabolism in PCD suspected patients may help confirmingthe diagnosis in an earlier stage and may predict a better outcome afterimmunotherapy.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010717 PMCID: PMC6024112PMID: 29901574  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
