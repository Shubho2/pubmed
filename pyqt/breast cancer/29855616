However, the acquired resistance to this therapeuticmodality is a major clinical challenge. Here we show that ionizing irradiation(IR)-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) at the Tyr705 residue and the induction of reactive oxygen species(ROS) in wild-type and radioresistant MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 triple-negativebreast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. Comparing with radiosensitive parental TNBCcells, significantly low levels of ROS and higher protein levels of phospho-STAT3and Bcl-2 were observed in TNBC cells with acquired radioresistance. Moreover,knockdown of STAT3 by shRNA sensitized the TNBC cells to IR. Niclosamide, apotent inhibitor of STAT3, overcame the radioresistance in TNBC cells viainhibition of STAT3 and Bcl-2 and induction of ROS. In combination withradiation, niclosamide treatment resulted in significant increase of ROSgeneration and induction of apoptosis in parental and radioresistant TNBC cellsin vitro and TNBC xenograft tumors in vivo. These findings demonstrate thatactivation of STAT3 and Bcl-2 and reduction of ROS contribute to the development of radioresistance in TNBC, and niclosamide acts as a potent radiosensitizer via inhibiting STAT3 and Bcl-2 and increasing ROS generation in TNBC cells andxenograft tumors. Our findings suggest that niclosamide in combination withirradiation may offer an effective alternative approach for restoring thesensitivity of radioresistant TNBC cells to IR for improved therapeutic efficacy and outcomes.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0340-y PMID: 29855616
