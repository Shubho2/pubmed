Nevertheless, the association between the prognosis of patientswith advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and LDH is not wellunderstood. This explorative and retrospective study was conducted to clarify theissue. We found that abnormal baseline LDH levels (> 250 IU/L) were significantlyassociated with age (> 40 y vs. ≤ 40 y, OR: 0.383, P = 0.031) and number ofmetastatic sites (2 vs. 1, OR: 4.619, P = 0.006; ≥ 3 vs. 1, OR: 4.727, P =0.002). The progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with post-treatment LDHhigher than baseline (Group 1) was significantly shorter than that in patientswith LDH decreased to normal (Group 3) and those with normal baseline andpost-treatment LDH (Group 4) (Group 3 vs. Group 1, HR: 0.517, P = 0.038; Group 4 vs. Group 1, HR: 0.346, P < 0.001). Overall survival (OS) in patients withabnormal baseline LDH was significantly shorter than in patients with normalbaseline LDH (abnormal vs. normal, HR: 2.073, P < 0.001). Patients whosepost-treatment LDH decreased to normal had the most objective response (complete and partial responses) rate after first-line chemotherapy (Group 3 vs. Group 1,OR: 0.074, P < 0.001). In this exploratory analysis, baseline LDH levelsassociated with OS, while LDH changes after first-line chemotherapy associatedwith PFS and the chemotherapeutic response. These results show that LDH may have important prognostic value for the survival and chemotherapeutic response inpatients with advanced TNBC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24246 PMCID: PMC5828224PMID: 29535837
