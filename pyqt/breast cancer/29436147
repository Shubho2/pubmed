The independent UKalcohol education charity Drinkaware was among the organisations whoseinformation was studied, and based on the analysis claims were made ofmisrepresentation of evidence about the alcohol-related risk of cancer andalcohol industry influence. This commentary challenges the validity of thesefindings in respect to the evidence relating to the Drinkaware information, asthe analysis is found to be misrepresenting the information by both disregarding the wider information content provided and the order and prominence with whichalcohol-related cancer risk is presented. Furthermore, it is argued that thepublic has a right to be provided with relevant evidence-based information about cancer risk. It is critical that Drinkaware's important public health function isnot compromised by unjustified allegations of inaccuracy and by unwarrantedattacks on its independence and integrity.Â© 2018 The Authors Drug and Alcohol Review published by John Wiley & SonsAustralia, Ltd on behalf of Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol andother Drugs.DOI: 10.1111/dar.12676 PMCID: PMC5873271PMID: 29436147
