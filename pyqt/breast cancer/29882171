The sample included GCs who: (1) practicecancer genetic counseling, (2) report a cancer practice setting, and (3) have aUS mailing address. We assessed: (1) number of Spanish-speaking GCs, (2)estimated proportion of Hispanic patients, and (3) approaches used to counselSSP. Of respondents (n = 229), 10% (n = 23) spoke Spanish. A higher proportion ofGCs practicing in states with ≥ 25% Hispanics reported speaking Spanish compared to those in states with lower Hispanic populations (p = 0.02). While there was a significantly higher percentage of Spanish-speaking GCs in states with largerHispanic populations, the absolute number was low and unlikely to meet the needs of patients. There is need to increase availability of GCS for SSPs and tounderstand the impact of services on patient health outcomes.DOI: 10.1007/s10903-018-0772-z PMID: 29882171
