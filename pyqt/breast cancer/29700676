Historically matchedblood has not always been collected as a source of germline DNA. This projectaimed to establish if normal FFPE breast tissue could be used as an alternativeto blood.METHODS: Exome sequencing was carried out on matched tumour tissue, normal breasttissue and blood on five patients in the START trial. Retrieved samples had been archived at different centres for at least 13 years. Following tissuemacro-dissection and DNA extraction, targeted exome capture was performed usingSureSelect Human All Exome v5 reagents (Agilent). Illumina paired-end librarieswere prepared from the captured target regions and sequenced on a HiSeq2500(Illumina) acquiring 2 × 75 bp reads. Somatic variants were called using theMuTect software analysis tool and copy number abnormalities (CNA) were identifiedusing CNVkit. Targeted sequencing and droplet digital PCR were used to validatesomatic variants and CNA, respectively.RESULTS: Overlap of somatic variants and CNA called on tumour versus blood andtumour versus normal breast tissue was good. Agreement in somatic variant callingranged from 76.9 to 93.6%. Variants with an allele frequency lower than 10% were more difficult to validate irrespective of the type of germline DNA used.Pearson's correlation coefficients for paired comparisons of CNA using blood ornormal tissue as reference ranged from 0.70 to 0.94.CONCLUSIONS: There is good correlation between the somatic mutations and CNAcalled using archived blood or normal breast tissue as germline referencematerial.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4798-7 PMCID: PMC6022520PMID: 29700676
