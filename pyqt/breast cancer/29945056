The pathological diagnosis was myofibroblastoma with spindle cell neoplasm with immunoreactivity.Myofibroblastoma is a rare benign disease and there is a lack of reports ofmultimodality imaging of this disease. We review the imaging features of thisrare disease across multiple imaging modalities with pathological correlation,and provide current treatment recommendations as well.Copyright Â© 2018.
