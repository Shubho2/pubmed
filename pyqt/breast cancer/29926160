Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a techniquewhich has been widely evaluated during the past decades. This review aims todetermine the clinical usefulness of OCT during cancer interventions focussing onqualitative features, quantitative features and the diagnostic value of OCT.METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for articles publishedbefore May 2018 using OCT in the field of surgical oncology. Based on thesearticles, an overview of the clinical usefulness of OCT was provided per tumortype.RESULTS: A total of 785 articles were revealed by our search, of which a total of136 original articles were available for analysis, which formed the basis of thisreview. OCT is currently utilised for both preoperative diagnosis andintraoperative detection of skin, oral, lung, breast, hepatobiliary,gastrointestinal, urological, and gynaecological malignancies. It showedpromising results in tumor detection on a microscopic level, especially usinghigher resolution imaging techniques, such as high-definition OCT and full-field OCT.CONCLUSION: In the near future, OCT could be used as an additional tool duringbronchoscopic or endoscopic interventions and could also be implemented in marginassessment during (laparoscopic) cancer surgery if a laparoscopic or handheld OCTdevice will be further developed to make routine clinical use possible.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2690-9 PMID: 29926160
