We aimed to investigate the association betweencircadian pathway genetic variation and risk of developing common cancers basedon the findings of genome-wide association studies (GWASs).METHODS: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 17 circadian genes reported bythree GWAS meta-analyses dedicated to breast (Discovery, Biology, and Risk ofInherited Variants in Breast Cancer (DRIVE) Consortium; cases, n = 15,748;controls, n = 18,084), prostate (Elucidating Loci Involved in Prostate CancerSusceptibility (ELLIPSE) Consortium; cases, n = 14,160; controls, n = 12,724) andlung carcinoma (Transdisciplinary Research In Cancer of the Lung (TRICL)Consortium; cases, n = 12,160; controls, n = 16,838) in patients of Europeanancestry were utilized to perform pathway analysis by means of the adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) method. Data were also available for the followingsubgroups: estrogen receptor negative breast cancer, aggressive prostate cancer, squamous lung carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma.RESULTS: We found a highly significant statistical association between circadian pathway genetic variation and the risk of breast (pathway P value = 1.9 × 10-6;top gene RORA, gene P value = 0.0003), prostate (pathway P value = 4.1 × 10-6;top gene ARNTL, gene P value = 0.0002) and lung cancer (pathway Pvalue = 6.9 × 10-7; top gene RORA, gene P value = 2.0 × 10-6), as well as alltheir subgroups. Out of 17 genes investigated, 15 were found to be significantly associated with the risk of cancer: four genes were shared by all threemalignancies (ARNTL, CLOCK, RORA and RORB), two by breast and lung cancer (CRY1and CRY2) and three by prostate and lung cancer (NPAS2, NR1D1 and PER3), whereas four genes were specific for lung cancer (ARNTL2, CSNK1E, NR1D2 and PER2) and twofor breast cancer (PER1, RORC).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, based on the largest series ever utilized forARTP-based gene and pathway analysis, support the hypothesis that circadianpathway genetic variation is involved in cancer predisposition.DOI: 10.1186/s12916-018-1010-1 PMCID: PMC5817863PMID: 29455641  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
