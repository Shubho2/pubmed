Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) have beenimplicated in cancer metastases and progression, thus, the need for the discoveryand development of effective BCSCs-specific therapies against metastatic andtriple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The expression of SCUBE2, originallyidentified in vascular endothelia, then in several non-endothelial cell types, isdownregulated in invasive breast carcinomas. However, the role of SCUBE2 in BCSCsremains unknown. This present study investigated the probable involvements ofSCUBE2 in BCSCs and TNBC metastasis.METHODS: The mRNA expression of SCUBE2, stemness and EMT markers in MDA-MB-231and Hs578T tumorspheres or adherent cells were evaluated by qRT-PCR andmicroarray analyses. Using gene overexpression, in vitro migration and invasionassays, as well as in vivo bioluminescence imaging, we evaluated the role ofSCUBE2 in MDA-MB-231 or Hs578T BCSCs. Western blot and cytotoxicity assays helpedidentify and validate SCUBE2 molecular target(s) and inhibitor(s).RESULTS: Concurrently increased SCUBE2 expression and cell motility were observedin TNBC tumorspheres compared to the parental adherent cells. SCUBE2overexpression augmented BCSCs motility in vitro, and enhanced TNBC metastasis invivo. While SCUBE2 overexpression activated Notch signaling its downregulationsuppressed Notch signal effectors NICD, Jagged 1, HEY1, and HES1.CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that SCUBE2 expression is upregulated in BCSCs,promote EMT and enhance TNBC metastasis by activating Notch signaling. Thisreveals a potential druggable molecular target and an effective therapeuticstrategy against metastatic and aggressive TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
