Chemo-resistance is often associated with changes in activity of the RAS/MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways and/or a high expression of ATP bindingcassette (ABC) transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancerresistance protein (BCRP). To assess the therapeutic efficacy in ATC of acombination of the dual mTOR kinase inhibitor vistusertib (AZD2014) andpaclitaxel (PTX), we generated a new cell line (Rho-) via the selection of human thyroid carcinoma 8505C cells that exhibit a low accumulation of rhodamine 123,which serves as a P-gp and BCRP substrate.METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used for P-gp and BCRP expression analyses inprimary ATC patient samples. Spheroid formation and immunodeficient NSG mice wereused for performing in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity assays, respectively.MTT, flow-cytometry, fluorescent microscopy, cell death and proliferation assays,as well as migration, invasion and gelatin degradation assays, were used toassess the potential of AZD2014 to enhance the effects of PTX. ATC xenografts in SCID mice were used for evaluating in vivo treatment efficacies.RESULTS: Rho- cells were found to be 10-fold more resistant to PTX than 8505Ccells and, in addition, to be more tumorigenic. We also found that AZD2014sensitized Rho- cells to PTX by inhibiting proliferation and by inducingautophagy. The combined use of AZD2014 and PTX efficiently inhibited in vitro ATCcell migration and invasion. Subsequent in vivo xenograft studies indicated that the AZD2014 and PTX combination effectively suppressed ATC tumor growth.CONCLUSIONS: Our data support results from recent phase I clinical trials usingcombinations of AZD2014 and PTX for the treatment of solid tumors. Suchcombinations may also be employed for the design of novel targeted ATC treatment strategies.DOI: 10.1007/s13402-018-0380-x PMID: 29790111
