NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs) are expressedon various tumor types and immunosuppressive cells within tumormicroenvironments, providing suitable targets for cancer therapy.METHODS: We applied a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) approach for the targeting of NKG2DLs expressed on human TNBCs. Lentiviral vectors were used to express the extracellular domain of human NKG2D that binds various NKG2DLs, fused tosignaling domains derived from T cell receptor CD3 zeta alone or with CD27 or4-1BB (CD137) costimulatory domain.RESULTS: Interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoted the expansion and self-enrichment ofNKG2D-redirected CAR T cells in vitro. High CD25 expression on first-generationNKG2D CAR T cells was essential for the self-enrichment effect in the presence ofIL-2, but not for CARs containing CD27 or 4-1BB domains. Importantly,self-enriched NKG2D CAR T cells effectively recognized and eliminated TNBC celllines in vitro, and adoptive transfer of T cells expressing NKG2D CARs with CD27 or 4-1BB specifically enhanced NKG2D CAR surface expression, T cell persistence, and the regression of established MDA-MB-231 TNBC in vivo. NKG2D-z CAR T cellslacking costimulatory domains were less effective, highlighting the need forcostimulatory signals.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that CD27 or 4-1BB costimulated,self-enriched NKG2D CAR-redirected T cells mediate anti-tumor activity againstTNBC tumor, which represent a promising immunotherapeutic approach to TNBCtreatment.DOI: 10.1186/s13045-018-0635-z PMCID: PMC6035420PMID: 29980239
