The introduction of HER2-targeted therapies led to significantimprovement in the prognosis of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, forboth early and advanced disease. These targeted therapies include the antibodies trastzumab and pertuzumab, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib, and theantibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). T-DM1 combines theanti-tumor activity of trastuzumab with that of DM1, a highly potent derivativeof the anti-microtubule agent maytansine, resulting in increased anti-tumoractivity. Notably, this agent has been demonstrated to be safe and is associated with low toxicity rates. However, maytansinoid, the cytotoxic component of T-DM1,does have the potential to induce various adverse events, particularly radiation necrosis, when used in combination with stereotactic radiosurgery. In thisreview, we aimed to summarize the current literature regarding T-DM1 safety andtoxicity, with special emphasis on the existing landmark studies.DOI: 10.1159/000480492 PMCID: PMC5803744 [Available on 2018-12-01]PMID: 29456473
