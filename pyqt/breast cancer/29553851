[Epub ahead ofprint]Adjuvant radiotherapy does not affect hemostasis.Begtrup KM(1), Hojbjerg JA(1), Offersen BV(2), Hvas AM(1).Author information: (1)a Center for Hemophilia and Thrombosis, Department of Clinical Biochemistry , Aarhus University Hospital , Aarhus , Denmark.(2)b Department of Experimental Clinical Oncology , Aarhus University Hospital , Aarhus , Denmark.Cancer is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolic disease. Venousthromboembolic disease accounts for a substantial addition to morbidity andmortality rates in cancer patients and is the second leading cause of death incancer patients, exceeded only by the underlying cancer. Only few previousstudies have investigated the influence of radiotherapy on hemostasis and whetherradiotherapy in itself causes an increased risk of venous thromboembolic disease.The aim was to investigate if adjuvant radiotherapy affects hemostasis aftersurgery and chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Radiotherapy consistedof either 40 Gy/15 fractions or 50 Gy/25 fractions. Blood samples were obtainedfrom 39 consecutive women before and immediately after the first, theintermediate, and the final radiation fraction. Platelet function was measuredusing impedance aggregometry, and thrombin generation was determined inplatelet-poor plasma using calibrated automated thrombogram. Furthermore,P-selectin, international normalized ratio, fibrinogen, activated partialthromboplastin time, coagulation factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, C-reactiveprotein (CRP), and soluble thrombomodulin were measured before and afterradiation treatment. Platelet aggregation was within reference interval beforeinitiation of radiotherapy, and remained unaffected during the radiation course. Neither serum P-selectin, thrombin generation, fibrinogen, coagulation factorVIII, von Willebrand factor, CRP nor thrombomodulin were substantially influencedby radiation treatment. The present study showed that radiotherapy did not affecthemostasis, neither by a single radiation dose nor during the radiation course,in early breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy.DOI: 10.1080/09537104.2018.1448378 PMID: 29553851
