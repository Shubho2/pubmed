Electronic address: yun.he@cqu.edu.cn.A series of novel azacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidines were synthesized, and evaluated for their antiproliferative activities against A549, MCF7, SH-SY5Y and CNE human cancer cell lines in vitro by using the CCK-8 assay. A number of compounds showedlow micromolar antiproliferative activities against MCF7 cell line. Compound 4j, containing a pyrrolidine moiety, exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity withan IC50 value of 0.58 μM. Furthermore, breast cancer cells were used to explorethe inhibition mechanism of these azacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidines. The resultssuggested these compounds were involved in inducing cell apoptosis viaup-regulation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 protein expression, and the cell cyclewas arrested at the S phase. Our reports here represent the first studies on the biological activities of azacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidines.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
