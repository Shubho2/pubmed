GovernadorMagalhães Barata 992, Belém, Pará, 66063-240, Brazil.Cancer is a genetic disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth andmetastasis. Cancer can have a number of causes, such the activation of oncogenes,the inactivation of tumor-suppressing genes, mutagenesis provoked by externalfactors, and epigenetic modifications. The development of diagnostic tools andtreatments using a molecular biological approach permits the use of sensitive,low-cost, noninvasive tests for cancer patients. Biomarkers can be used toprovide rapid, personalized oncology, in particular the molecular diagnosis ofchronic myeloid leukemia, and gastric, colon, and breast cancers. Molecular testsbased on DNA methylation can also be used to direct treatments or evaluate thetoxic effects of chemotherapy. The adequate diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of the response of cancer patients to treatment are essential to ensure the most effective therapy, reduce the damaging effects of treatment, and direct thetherapy to specific targets, and in this context, molecular biology has becomeincreasingly important in oncology. In this brief review, we will demonstrate thefundamental importance of molecular biology for the treatment of three types ofcancer-chronic myeloid leukemia, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, andastrocytomas (sporadic tumors of the central nervous system). In each of thesethree models, distinct biological mechanisms are involved in the transformationof the cells, but in all cases, molecular biology is fundamental to thedevelopment of personalized analyses for each patient and each type of neoplasia,and to guarantee the success of the treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s10238-018-0518-1 PMID: 30006681
