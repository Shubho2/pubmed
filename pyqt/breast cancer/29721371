As these factors are hypothesized to bestrong immunologic prerequisites for the use of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) antibodies, multiple clinical trials testing single ICBs have advanced to PhaseIII, with early indications of heterogeneous response rates of <20% to anti-PD1and anti-PDL1 ICB. While promising, these modest response rates highlight theneed for mechanistic studies to understand how different ICBs function, how theircombination impacts functionality and efficacy, as well as what immunologicparameters predict efficacy to different ICBs regimens in TNBC. To address these issues, we tested anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 in multiple models of TNBC and foundthat their combination profoundly enhanced the efficacy of either treatmentalone. We demonstrate that this efficacy is due to anti-CTLA4-driven expansion ofan individually unique T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire whose functionality isenhanced by both intratumoral Treg suppression and anti-PD1 blockade of tumorexpressed PDL1. Notably, the individuality of the TCR repertoire was observedregardless of whether the tumor cells expressed a nonself antigen (ovalbumin) or if tumor-specific transgenic T-cells were transferred prior to sequencing.However, responsiveness was strongly correlated with systemic measures oftumor-specific T-cell and B-cell responses, which along with systemic assessment of TCR expansion, may serve as the most useful predictors for clinicalresponsiveness in future clinical trials of TNBC utilizing anti-PD1/anti-CTLA4ICB.DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1421891 PMCID: PMC5927534PMID: 29721371
