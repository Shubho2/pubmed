Hence, in this study, we present theviscoelastic properties (moduli and viscosities) and the actin cytoskeletalstructures of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells with differentmetastatic potential. These include: MCF-10A normal breast cells (studied as acontrol); MDA-MB-468 cells (less metastatic TNBC cells), and MDA-MB-231 cells(highly metastatic TNBC cells). A combination of shear assay and digital imaging correlation (DIC) techniques is used to measure the local viscoelastic propertiesof live breast cells subjected to constant shear stress. The local moduli andviscosities of the nuclei and cytoplasm are characterized using a generalizedMaxwell model, which is used to determine the time-dependent creep responses ofcells. The nuclei are shown to be stiffer and more viscous than the cytoplasms ofthe normal breast cells and TNBC cells. The MCF-10A normal breast cells are foundto be twice as stiff as the less metastatic MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells andover ten times stiffer than the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.Similar trends are also observed in the viscosities of the nuclei and thecytoplasms. The measured differences in cell viscoelastic properties are alsoassociated with significant changes in the cell cytoskeletal structure, which is studied using confocal fluorescence microscopy. This reveals significantdifferences in the levels of actin expression and organization in TNBC cells asthey become highly metastatic. Our results suggest that the shear assaymeasurements of cell viscoelastic properties may be used as effective biomarkers for TNBC diagnosis and screening.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
