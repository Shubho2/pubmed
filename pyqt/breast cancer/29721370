Isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors elicitanti-tumor immune responses that are distinct from those induced by inhibitors ofclass I PI3K isoforms (pan-PI3K inhibitors). The present study investigated thetherapeutic effect and potential for stimulating anti-tumor immunity of combined therapy with an anti-HER2/neu antibody and pan-PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941) or aPI3K p110α isoform-selective inhibitor (A66) in mouse models of breast cancer.The anti-neu antibody inhibited tumor growth and enhanced anti-tumor immunity in HER2/neu+ breast cancer TUBO models, whereas GDC-0941 or A66 alone did not.Anti-neu antibody and PI3K inhibitor synergistically promoted anti-tumor immunityby increasing functional T cell production. In the presence of the anti-neuantibody, A66 was more effective than GDC-0941 at increasing the fraction ofCD4+, CD8+, and IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytepopulation. Detection of IFN-γ levels by enzyme-linked immunospot assay showedthat the numbers of tumor-specific T cells against neu and non-neu tumor antigenswere increased by combined PI3K inhibitor plus anti-neu antibody treatment, with A66 exhibiting more potent effects than GDC-0941. In a TUBO (neu+) and TUBO-P2J(neu-) mixed tumor model representing immunohistochemistry 2+ tumors, A66suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival to a greater extent than GDC-0941 when combined with anti-neu antibody. These results demonstrate that a PI3Kp110α-isoform-selective inhibitor is an effective adjunct to trastuzumab in thetreatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1421890 PMCID: PMC5927520 [Available on 2019-01-16]PMID: 29721370
