We implemented aperformance improvement program to increase the uptake of preventive therapyamong women with atypical hyperplasia (AH) and lobular cancer in situ(LCIS).Methods: A performance improvement program was implemented at the MDAnderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), November 2015 to February 2017, forpatients with a new (<6 months) or existing (≥6 months) diagnosis of AH/LCIS. Theprogram consisted of an audit of eligible women who were recommended andprescribed preventive therapy and the provision of clinical performance feedback to providers. The baseline uptake of preventive therapy was estimated frompatients enrolled in a high-risk breast cohort.Results: Baseline uptake ofpreventive therapy was 44%. The program registered 408 patients with a new (n =87) or existing diagnosis (n = 321) of AH/LCIS; mean age was 57 and 71% werenon-Hispanic white. Ninety-eight percent of patients received a recommendationfor preventive therapy. The overall prescribing of preventive therapy to patientswith a new or existing diagnosis was 82% (monthly range, 40%-100%; Ptrend = 0.76)and 48% (monthly range, 27%-57%; Ptrend < 0.01), respectively. Adherence amongpatients with a new or existing diagnosis was 76% and 48% (P < 0.01) at 6 months,respectively.Conclusion: A system-level approach improved the uptake ofpreventive therapy. Identifying women at the time of diagnosis of AH/LCIS andoffering a strong recommendation are key components for improving acceptance and adherence with preventive therapy.
