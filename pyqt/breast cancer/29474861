MicroRNA-140-3p had a good diagnosticaccuracy for discrimination of the two groups (AUC = 0.667; sensitivity = 70%;specificity = 50%). Serum microRNA-140-3p level was overexpressed inpremenopausal patients who were ≤48 years old. ROC curve showed a similar patternagain (AUC = 0.690; sensitivity = 73%; specificity = 50%).CONCLUSIONS: microRNA-140-3p has the potential for detection of breast cancer,especially in premenopausal and in ≤48 years old women.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
