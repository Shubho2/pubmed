Multivariate analysis showed that elder patient (OR: 25.301), internal vascularity (OR: 4.518), and notcircumscribed margin (OR: 3.813) were independent predictors for malignancy,while predominately cystic lesions (OR: 0.178) was a predictor for benign lesions(all p < 0.05). Invalid SWS measurement was occurred in 19 of 31 (61.3%)malignant lesions and 16 of 62 (25.8%) benign lesions, respectively (p < 0.05).The mean SWS value for malignant lesions was significantly lower than that forbenign ones, being 1.60±0.63 m/s (range, 0.68-2.70 m/s) versus 2.33±0.77 m/s(range, 0.67-3.97 m/s) (p < 0.05). Areas under the ROC curve (Azs) for BreastImaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment, strain elasticity score, ARFI imaging and valid point SWS measurement were 0.844, 0.734, 0.763 and0.778,respectively.CONCLUSIONS: US BI-RADS category, strain elastography score, ARFI imagingpatterns and point SWS measurement are useful for malignancy prediction ofcomplex cystic and solid breast lesions. The result that SWS for malignantlesions is lower than benign one should be carefully interpreted since invalidSWS measurement is excluded for analysis. The true stiffness of malignant cystic and solid lesions should be further evaluated with a new generation oftwo-dimensional SWS imaging.DOI: 10.3233/CH-170252 PMID: 29660903  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
