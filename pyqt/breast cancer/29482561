X-ray-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) has gained a majorattention owing to the limitless penetration of X-rays. However, substantialoutcomes have still not been achieved due to the low luminescence efficiency ofscintillating nanoparticles and weak energy transfer to the photosensitizer. The present work describes the development of Y2.99Pr0.01Al5O12-based (YP) mesoporoussilica coated nanoparticles, multifunctionalized with protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)and folic acid (YPMS@PpIX@FA) for potential application in targeted deep PDT.RESULTS: A YP nanophosphor core was synthesized using the sol-gel method to beused as X-ray energy transducer and was then covered with a mesoporous silicalayer. The luminescence analysis indicated a good spectral overlap between thePpIX and nanoscintillator at the Soret as well as Q-band region. The comparisonof the emission spectra with or without PpIX showed signs of energy transfer, aprerequisite for deep PDT. In vitro studies showed the preferential uptake of thenanocomposite in cancer cells expressing the folate receptorFolr1, validating thetargeting efficiency. Direct activation of conjugated PpIX with UVA in vitroinduced ROS production causing breast and prostate cancer cell death indicatingthat the PpIX retained its activity after conjugation to the nanocomposite. Thein vivo toxicity analysis showed the good biocompatibility and non-immunogenicresponse of YPMS@PpIX@FA.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that YPMS@PpIX@FA nanocomposites are promisingcandidates for X-ray-mediated PDT of deep-seated tumors. The design of thesenanoparticles allows the functionalization with exchangeable targeting ligandsthus offering versatility, in order to target various cancer cells, expressingdifferent molecular targets on their surface.DOI: 10.1186/s12951-018-0344-3 PMCID: PMC5827996PMID: 29482561
