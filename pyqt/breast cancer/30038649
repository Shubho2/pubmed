Our early clinicalresults showed that the treatment methods were technically reproducible betweeninstitutions and showed excellent disease control at a median follow-up of 26months in our previous report. At present, total 46 patients from sixinstitutions underwent the treatment regimen from October 2009 to December 2011, and the median follow-up time was 60 months (range, 57-67 months). In 46patients, we experienced one patient who had rib fracture as a late complication.The dose-volume histogram (DVH) result of this patient was analyzed. The D0.01cc,D0.1cc, and D1cc values of the patient were 913, 817, and 664 cGy per fraction,respectively. These values were the highest values in 46 patients. The averageD0.01cc, D0.1cc, and D1cc values of the other 45 patients were 546, 500, and 419,respectively, cGy per fraction. From this result, DVH values showing high-doseirradiated volume (D0.01cc, D0.1cc, and D1cc) seem to be a good predictive factorof rib fracture for accelerated partial breast irradiation. However, furtherinvestigation is necessary because of the small number of patients investigated.DOI: 10.5114/jcb.2018.76983 PMCID: PMC6052388PMID: 30038649
