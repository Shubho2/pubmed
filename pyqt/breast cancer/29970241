We created logistic regression models to determine characteristicsassociated with receipt of follow-up care instructions, and stratified by models by cancer type to evaluate differences in factors.RESULTS: Our sample included 954 (66%) and 492 (34%) women with breast andgynecologic cancers respectively. Even after adjustment, women treated forgynecologic cancer had 63% lower odds [0.37 (0.25-0.55)] of receiving follow-upinstructions compared to women with breast cancer. Among breast cancer patients, those with an income <$25,000 per year had lower odds of receiving follow-upinstructions [0.53(0.31-0.92)], while patients with high BMI (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) had higher odds of receiving follow-up instructions [1.91 (1.15-3.18)]. Amonggynecologic cancer patients, those diagnosed 51-75 years had higher odds ofreceiving follow-up instructions compared to those diagnosed ≤50 years [2.54(1.13-5.70)].CONCLUSION: In our study, gynecologic cancer patients less frequently receivedfollow-up instructions compared to breast cancer patients. Receipt of follow-upinstructions also differed by demographic and lifestyle factors. The resultsprovide evidence for the need of public health initiatives to increase thefrequency of follow-up instructions for gynecologic cancer patients, which canpotentially increase the rate of follow-up and improve long-term outcomes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
