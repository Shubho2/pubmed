However, there is a paucity ofdata available on long-term H treatment of patients. The Rollover Protocol (ROP) Study was conducted to report safety data for patients with HER2-positive locallyadvanced/metastatic breast and gastric/GEJ cancer who have received long-term Htherapy (≥ 5 years and ≥ 3 years for breast and gastric/GEJ cancer,respectively).METHODS: The ROP Study was a single-arm, multicenter, international continuation trial of H in patients who had previously completed a global Roche-sponsoredtrial with H therapy, had stable disease, and were receiving H at the end of the lead-in trial. Patients with chronic heart failure during the lead-in trial couldbe included following a risk-benefit analysis. The primary objectives were toprovide H therapy to patients with HER2-overexpressing locallyadvanced/metastatic breast or gastric/GEJ cancer at the end of the lead-in study,and to follow the long-term outcomes and long-term overall safety in thesepatients.RESULTS: Twenty-five of 69 patients enrolled in the ROP Study received long-term H therapy (19 breast cancer and 6 gastric/GEJ cancer). The median duration of Htreatment for patients with breast cancer was 8 years 7 months, and 5 years2 months for patients with gastric/GEJ cancer. The cardiac status of the patientsremained stable over time, with no serious cardiac adverse events or markedchanges in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The median overall worstLVEF measurement was 57.0%, and no patients experienced an LVEF of < 45% (range47-63%). There were no serious adverse events related to study treatment.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that H has an acceptable safety profile andwas well tolerated in patients who received long-term H therapy (≥ 5 years and ≥ 3 years for breast and gastric/GEJ cancer, respectively). Further investigationand reporting of long-term H therapy would be valuable.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was retrospectively registered on March 24, 2016with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02721641 .DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4183-2 PMCID: PMC5856394PMID: 29544445
