Histological staining was used as a reference. Ramanspectroscopy was especially useful in the detection and semi-quantitativeanalysis of the vitamin A content in lung lipofibroblasts, whereas the IRtechnique provided semi-quantitative information on the contents of nucleicacids, carbohydrates including glycogen, and lipids as well as changes in thesecondary structures of tissue proteins. Our spectroscopic results suggest thatthe early phase of metastasis in the lung is characterized by a decrease in theendogenous retinoid content in combination with a decrease in the content ofglycogen and lipids.DOI: 10.1039/c7an01883e PMID: 29637979
