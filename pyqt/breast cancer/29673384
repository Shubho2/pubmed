Each patientreceived 50-50.4 cobalt Gy equivalent (CGE) at 1.8 or 2 CGE per daily fraction.Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors forgrade 3 skin toxicity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis andthe area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of themodels.RESULTS: 43% of the studied patients developed grade 3 radiation dermatitis. The dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters of V52.5CGE and D10cm3 to skin5mm werecorrelated with grade 3 radiation dermatitis in both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Univariate logistic regression analysis suggestedthat D10cm3 to skin5mm (AUC = 0.69) and V52.5CGE to skin5mm (AUC = 0.70) wereprognostic for grade 3 skin toxicity. The models using the combination of D10cm3 to skin5mm or V52.5CGE to skin5mm with breast volume marginally increased the AUCto 0.72 and 0.73, respectively. Models using the combination of D10cm3 to skin5mmor V52.5CGE to skin5mm with history of smoking increased the AUC to 0.75 and0.83, respectively.CONCLUSION: In the current study, we identified prognostic factors for grade 3radiation dermatitis in patients treated with passive-scattering proton therapyfor breast cancer. This study provides promising tool for identifying high riskpatients for whom treatment plan adjustment could be done to reduce the risk ofradiation-induced grade 3 skin toxicity.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-1004-3 PMCID: PMC5909216PMID: 29673384
