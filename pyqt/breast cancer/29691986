This was an observational,hospital-based, case-control association study. Analyses of single variant,linkage, haplotype, interaction and nomogram were performed. Risk was expressedas odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). All studied variants were inthe Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and were not linked. The mutant allele frequenciesof rs1890637, rs3092856 and rs1801516 in ATM gene were significantly higher incases than in controls (P = .005, <.001 and .001, respectively). Two variants,rs1042059 and rs201024480, in BMI-1 gene were low penetrant, with no detectablesignificance. After adjustment, rs189037 and rs1801516 were significantlyassociated with breast cancer under the additive model (OR: 1.37 and 1.52, 95%CI: 1.10-1.71 and 1.14-2.04, P: .005 and .005, respectively). In haplotypeanalysis, haplotypes A-C-G-G (in order of rs189037, rs3092856, rs1801516 andrs373759) and A-C-A-A in ATM gene were significantly associated with 1.98-foldand 6.04-fold increased risk of breast cancer (95% CI: 1.36-2.90 and 1.65-22.08, respectively). Nomogram analysis estimated that the cumulative proportion of 3significant variants in ATM gene was about 12.5%. Our findings collectivelyindicated that ATM gene was a candidate gene in susceptibility to breast cancerin Han Chinese.Â© 2018 The Authors.
