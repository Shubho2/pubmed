The main objective of the current study is to investigatewhether selenium nanoparticles (nano-Se) can induce the chemo-sensitivity of5-fluorouracil (FU)-encapsulated poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles(nano-FU) in breast and colon cancer cell lines. Nano-Se and nano-FU weresynthesized and characterized, then applied individually or in combination uponMCF7, MDA-MB-231, HCT 116, and Caco-2 cancerous cell lines. Cytotoxicity,cellular glucose uptake, and apoptosis, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and zinc (Zn) levels, were investigated upon the differenttreatments. We have resulted that nano-FU induced cell death in MCF7 and Caco-2more effectively than MDA-MB-231 and HCT 116 cell lines. Moreover, nano-FU plusnano-Se potentiate MCF7 and Caco-2 chemo-sensitivity were higher than MDA-MB-231 and HCT 116 cancerous cell lines. It is relevant to note that Se and FUnano-formulations inhibited cancer cell bioenergetics via glucose uptake slightblockage. Furthermore, nano-FU increased the levels of NO and MDA in media overcancer cells, while their combinations with nano-Se rebalance the redox statuswith Zn increment. We noticed that MCF7 cell line is sensitive, while MDA-MB-231 cell line is resistant to Se and nano-Se. This novel approach could be of greatpotential to enhance the chemo-sensitivity in breast and colon cancer cells.DOI: 10.1007/s12011-018-1360-8 PMID: 29748931
