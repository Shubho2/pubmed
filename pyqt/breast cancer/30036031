[Epub aheadof print]Erythrocyte-Derived Theranostic Nanoplatforms for Near Infrared FluorescenceImaging and Photodestruction of Tumors.Burns JM(1), Vankayala R(1), Mac JT(2), Anvari B(1)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Bioengineering , University of California, Riverside , 900University Avenue , Riverside , California 92521 , United States.(2)Department of Biochemistry , University of California, Riverside , 900University Avenue , Riverside , California 92521 , United States.Nanoparticles activated by near-infrared (NIR) excitation provide a capabilityfor optical imaging and photodestruction of tumors. We have engineered opticalnanoconstructs derived from erythrocytes, which are doped with the FDA-approvedNIR dye, indocyanine green (ICG). We refer to these constructs as NIRerythrocyte-mimicking transducers (NETs). Herein, we investigate thephototheranostic capabilities of NETs for fluorescence imaging andphotodestruction of SKBR3 breast cancer cells and subcutaneous xenograft tumorsin mice. Our cellular studies demonstrate that NETs are internalized by thesecancer cells and localized to their lysosomes. As evidenced by NIR fluorescenceimaging and in vivo laser irradiation studies, NETs remain available withintumors at 24 h postintravenous injection. In response to continuous wave 808 nmlaser irradiation at intensity of 680 mW/cm2 for 10-15 min, NETs mediate thedestruction of cancer cells and tumors in mice through synergistic photochemical and photothermal effects. We demonstrate that NETs are effective in mediatingphotoactivation of Caspase-3 to induce tumor apoptosis. Our results providesupport for the effectiveness of NETs as theranostic agents for fluorescenceimaging and photodestruction of tumors and their role in photoinduced apoptosisinitiated by their localization to lysosomes.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b08005 PMID: 30036031
