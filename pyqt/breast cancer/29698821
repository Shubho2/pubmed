Electronic address: lbraud@tulane.edu.The transport pathways and permeation kinetics of lipophilic and hydrophilicfluorescent dyes through porcine mammary papillae were visualized and quantified.Porcine mammary papillae, removed from full-thickness abdominal tissue, werepositioned in a Franz diffusion cell for passive diffusion studies. Solutionscontaining the fluorescent dyes were applied topically for time periods rangingfrom 30 min to 48 h. Dye concentrations in tissue and Franz diffusioncompartments were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and fluorimetry.Fluorescence micrographs elucidated two permeation pathways, transepidermal andtransductal. Hydrophilic sulforhodamine B predominantly penetrated via thetransepidermal route, while lipophilic nile red diffused mainly by thetransductal route. An almost 4-fold higher amount of sulforhodamine B wasretained within the nipple over time compared to nile red, despite both dyespermeating through the tissue at similar rates. Diffusion through the porcinenipple was 500-fold higher than through adjacent skin for both dyes, likelyattributable to the two mammary ducts which provide an entry point and transport route through the tissue. These results, generated from both qualitative andquantitative evidence at a micro and macro scale, demonstrate that the mammaryducts provide a direct pathway that contributes significantly to passivetransport through the nipple, particularly for lipophilic molecules.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
