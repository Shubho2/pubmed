The task forcecommissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence fromother published systematic reviews and individual studies.Consensus Process: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mailcommunications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committeesand members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.Conclusions: We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men withsymptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fastingmorning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as theinitial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating themeasurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T isnear the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sexhormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration usingeither equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In mendetermined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnosticevaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sexcharacteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing thepotential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involvingthe patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy inpatients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the followingconditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL inmen at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g., African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severelower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarctionor stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that whenclinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in themid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, takinginto consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specificadverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor menreceiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms,adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations;and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating Ttherapy.DOI: 10.1210/jc.2018-00229 PMID: 29562364
