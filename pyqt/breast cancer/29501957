Correlations between the ADC values and prognostic factors wereevaluated.RESULTS: Multivariate regression analyses showed that Ki67 expression andmolecular subtype were independently associated with the ADC. Discriminantanalysis excluded the ADC as a good biomarker for subtype, but the mean ADCsignificantly distinguished Ki67-positive (low ADC) from Ki67-negative (high ADC)lesions, as observed in the in ROC curves, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 1.00 and a cut-off value of 0.97 × 10-3 mm2/s.CONCLUSION: The ADC may be helpful for predicting Ki67 expression in IDCpreoperatively.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
