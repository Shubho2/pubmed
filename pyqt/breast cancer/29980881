Richard.Kim@lhsc.on.ca.PURPOSE: Tamoxifen is frequently prescribed to prevent breast cancer recurrence. Tamoxifen is a prodrug and requires bioactivation by CYP2D6. Tamoxifen use isoften limited by adverse effects including severe hot flashes. There is paucityof prospectively collected data in terms of CYP2D6 genotype and measuredtamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen concentrations in relation to hotflash severity during tamoxifen therapy.METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal prospective study of breast cancer patients on tamoxifen (n = 410). At each visit, blood samples were collected, and patientscompleted a standardized hot flash survey (n = 1144) that reflected hot flashseverity during the 7 days prior to the visit. Plasma concentrations oftamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and endoxifen were measured using liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and genotyping was carried out forCYP2D6. A linear mixed-effects regression analysis assessed the association ofcovariates in relation to the hot flash severity score (HFSS).RESULTS: Median age at first assessment was 50 years with 61.9% of patientsconsidered peri-menopausal. Most patients (92.2%) experienced hot flash symptoms with 51.0% having low HFSS (0-4) and 7.32% experiencing HFSS > 25. Age wassignificantly associated with hot flash severity, with patients aged 45-59 morelikely to have higher HFSS. Neither duration of tamoxifen therapy nor observedtamoxifen, endoxifen and 4-hydroxy tamoxifen plasma concentration predicted hotflash severity. Genetic variation in CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 was not predictive of hotflash severity.CONCLUSIONS: Hot flash severity during tamoxifen therapy can not be accounted forby CYP2D6 genotype or observed plasma concentration of tamoxifen,4-hydroxytamoxifen, or endoxifen.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4876-x PMID: 29980881
