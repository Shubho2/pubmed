Ansamitocin P-3 (AP-3),which is produced by Actinosynnema pretiosum, has been developed as a cytotoxicdrug for breast cancer. Despite its importance, AP-3 is of limited applicability because of the low production yield. A. pretiosum strain X47 was developed fromA. pretiosum ATCC 31565 by mutation breeding and shows a relatively high AP-3yield. Here, we analyzed the A. pretiosum X47 genome, which is ~8.13Â Mb in lengthwith 6693 coding sequences, 58 tRNA genes, and 15 rRNA genes. The DNA sequence ofthe ansamitocin biosynthetic gene cluster is highly similar to that of thecorresponding cluster in A. pretiosum ATCC 31565, with 99.9% identity. However,RT-qPCR analysis showed that the expression levels of ansamitocin biosyntheticgenes were significantly increased in X47 compared with the levels in thewild-type strain, consistent with the higher yield of AP-3 in X47. The annotated complete genome sequence of this strain will facilitate understanding themolecular mechanisms of ansamitocin biosynthesis and regulation in A. pretiosumand help further genetic engineering studies to enhance the production of AP-3.DOI: 10.1007/s00284-018-1521-1 PMID: 29858620
