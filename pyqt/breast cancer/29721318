The most frequentlydiagnosed of these are breast, cervical, melanoma, ovarian, and haematologicalneoplasms. Tumours of respiratory origin are very uncommon during pregnancy. Wepresent a case of tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), a rare type of primaryairway tumour, diagnosed in a pregnant woman. To our knowledge, this is the thirdreported case of tracheal ACC complicating pregnancy. We discuss potentialbarriers to timely diagnosis of malignancies during pregnancy and consideroptimal management strategies, taking into account the potential harm to themother and foetus in a field with a limited evidence base.DOI: 10.1002/rcr2.317 PMCID: PMC5909374PMID: 29721318
