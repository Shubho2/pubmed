China.Metastatic breast cancer is one of the major types of cancer in women. However,despite being the focus of considerable research efforts, its molecular mechanismremains to be fully elucidated. The B-cell lymphoma/leukemia gene-2 (Bcl-2)protein is well known for its role in inhibiting programmed cell death/apoptosis.However, little is known concerning its function in cell invasion and migration. In the present study, cell migration and invasion assays revealed thatanti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein induced migration and invasion without affectingcell proliferation in the BCap37 breast cancer cell line. In addition, it wasfound that the overexpression of Bcl-2 in BCap37 cells increased metastasis tothe lung in a mouse model. Using western blotting and RT q-PCR analysis, it wasdemonstrated that the overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited the expression ofE-cadherin, an epithelial marker, whereas it increased the levels of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin. Therefore, the results suggested that Bcl-2 may induce cellular metastasis in breast cancer via the epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8455 PMCID: PMC5958888PMID: 29844816
