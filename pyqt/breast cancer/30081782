China.The determination of carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA15-3), a highly importantspecific cancer biomarker, in serum is essential for early diagnosis anddetection of breast cancer. Herein, a sensitive immunofluorescence assay forCA15-3 detection in serum was developed using the antibody-antigen-antibodysandwich format. A10254, a fluorescein derivative, was used to label the CA15-3antibody to enhance the assay sensitivity. The obtained fluorescence immunosensorcould detect CA15-3 with high sensitivity and favorable specificity. The limitsof detection (LOD) were determined to be 0.11 and 0.18 U mL-1 in a linear rangeof 0.25-14 U mL-1 in a buffer solution and 2% serum system, respectively.Moreover, the strong anti-interference ability and good reproducibility in 2%serum suggest that the IFA has great potential for the diagnosis of breast cancerin clinical practice.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/0929866525666180806113236 PMID: 30081782
