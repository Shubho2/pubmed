Driver alterations were characterized using next-generationsequencing in primary tumors from a subset of 764 patients from 7329 eligiblepatients with ER+/HER2- BC, with 841 distant recurrences after a median of 8.1years of follow-up. To correct for the oversampling of distant recurrences,weighted analysis methods were used. This analysis was conducted from April 4,2016, to November 30, 2016.Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of driver alterations, associationswith clinicopathologic factors, distant recurrence-free interval, and treatmentinteractions were analyzed. Multivariable analyses were performed to adjust forclinicopathologic factors.Results: Of 764 samples, 538 (70.4%), including 140 distant recurrence events,were successfully sequenced. Nineteen driver alterations were observed with 5% orgreater frequency, with a mean of 4 alterations (range, 0-15) per tumor. PIK3CAmutations were the most common (49%) and were significantly associated withreduction in the risk for distant recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% CI,0.38-0.85; P = .006). TP53 mutations (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.21-3.04; P = .006),amplifications on 11q13 (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.36-3.37; P = .001) and 8p11 (HR,3.02; 95% CI, 1.88-4.84; P < .001), and increasing number of driver alterations(HR per additional alteration, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.25; P < .001) were associatedwith significantly greater risk. Amplifications on 11q13 and 8p11 remainedsignificant predictors in multivariable analysis, but not PIK3CA and TP53mutations. Patients with tumors harboring kinase or helical domain PIK3CAmutations derived significantly greater benefit from letrozole over tamoxifenthan patients whose tumors did not (P interaction = .002).Conclusions and Relevance: In ER+/HER2- postmenopausal, early-stage BC,amplifications on 11q13 and 8p11 were significantly associated with increasedrisk for distant recurrence and PIK3CA mutations were predictive of greatermagnitude of benefit from letrozole. With these findings, DNA-basedclassification may aid adjuvant treatment decision making in this setting.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00004205.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1778 PMID: 29902286
