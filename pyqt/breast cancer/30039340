The previous researches have not established anynoteworthy association with breast cancer. Therefore, through extensiveliterature search and in-silico analysis, we have tried to focus on the role ofCDKN2A in breast cancer. CDKN2A variants in breast cancer were collected fromdifferent databases. The overall percentage of variants (approximately 5.8%) and their incidence frequency in breast cancer cases were found to be very low ascompared to the number of samples screened in different studies. Exon 2 wasidentified as the major region of alternations. Approximately 42.8% were entiregene deletions, while 24.2% were missense mutations. These variants cannot beignored because of their pathogenic effects as interpreted by the bioinformatics tools used in the present study. Earlier studies have shown that CDKN2A excludes the predisposition of germline variants, but interestingly shares common breastcancer germline variants with other carcinomas. Most of the data have revealedthis gene as rarely mutated or deleted in breast cancer. However, few associationstudies have shown that in addition to being a 'multiple' tumour suppressor gene,it is mutated/deleted more in breast cancer cell lines as compared to breastcancer tissues or blood samples; thus, this gene cannot be neglected as a breast cancer candidate gene. The deletion/malfunctioning of CDKN2A in different tumoursincluding breast cancer has recently led to the discovery of many clinical CDKinhibitors. Furthermore, these collected genetic variants will also be helpful indeveloping diagnostic, preventive, and treatment approaches for patients.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0894-0 PMID: 30039340
