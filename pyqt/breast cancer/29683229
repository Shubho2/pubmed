To explore the insertion site of MMTVLTR in TA2 mousegenome, reverse PCR and nested PCR were used to amplify the unknown sequence onboth sides of the MMTV-LTRSAG gene in SBC and normal breast tissue of TA2 mice.Furthermore, the clinicopathological significance of the insertion site wasevaluated in 43 samples of normal breast tissue, 46 samples of breast cystichyperplasia, 54 samples of ductal carcinoma in situ, 142 samples of primarybreast cancer and 47 samples of lymph node metastatic breast cancer by RNA insitu hybridization. We confirmed that the insertion site of the MMTV-LTRSAG gene was located between Igκv2-112 and Igκv14-111 in chromosome 6 of TA2 mouse. IGκCwas localized in the stromal cells of TA2 mouse with SBC and in human breastcancer tissues. Tumor cells were negative for IGκC in RNA in situ hybridization. The positive staining index of IGκC in stromal cells was the highest in lymphnode metastatic breast cancer, followed by primary breast cancer, ductalcarcinoma in situ, and breast cystic hyperplasia. Furthermore, the positivestaining index of IGκC was related to the expression of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67.Our findings showed that stromal IGκC expression was associated with theinitiation of SBC in TA2 mice. IGκC may be a high-risk factor for the initiation and progression of human breast cancer.© 2018 The Authors.
