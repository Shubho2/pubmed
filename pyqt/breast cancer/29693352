Email: shojaeeleyla@gmail.comBackground: Recurrence of breast cancer after treatment is generally due toloco-regional invasion or distant metastasis. Although patients with metastasisare considered incurable, existing treatments might prolong a patientâ€™s lifewhile also improving its quality. Choice of approach for individual patientsrequires identification of relevant survival factors. This study concerns factorsinfluencing survival after recurrence in Iranian breast cancer patients. Methods:This study was performed on 442 recurrent breast cancer patients referred to the Cancer Research Center of Shahid Beheshti University between 1985 and 2015. Afterconfirming recurrence as a distant metastasis or loco-regional invasion, theeffects of demographic, clinic-pathologic, biological, type of surgery and typeof adjuvant treatment on survival were evaluated using univariate andmultivariate stratified Cox models. Results: The mean survival after recurrencewas 18 months (5 days to 13 years), 219 patients (70.42%) survived two years, 75 patients (24.12%) survived from 2 to 5 years, and 17 patients (5.47%) survivedmore than 5 years. In this study, it was found through univariate analysis thatthe factors of age, lymph node status, DFI, place of recurrence and nodal ratiodemonstrated greatest influence on survival after recurrence. On multivariateanalysis, the most important factors influencing survival were the place ofrecurrence and the lymph node status. Conclusion: The results of this studyenhance our knowledge of effects of different factors on survival of patientsafter breast cancer recurrence. Thus, they may be used to inform treatmentchoice.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.949 PMCID: PMC6031793PMID: 29693352
