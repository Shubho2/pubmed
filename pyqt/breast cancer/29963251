Strikingly, despite all themolecular analyses performed to identify the escape mechanisms behind thisresistance, it still represents a question point. MiRNAs have been correlatedwith occurrence and progression of human cancer, and their potential as clinical tools has emerged in the last years. We previously reported that oncosuppressive miR-205 targets HER3, thus increasing the responsiveness to TKIs lapatinib andgefitinib in preclinical models. Here we demonstrate that HER3 inhibition bymiR-205 ectopic expression or siRNA-mediated silencing improves theresponsiveness to Trastuzumab in vitro in HER2+ BC cell lines, and that thiseffect is exerted through impairment of AKT-mediated pathway. Moreover,evaluating a series of 52 HER2+ BC patients treated with adjuvant Trastuzumab, weobserved that higher miR-205 expression is significantly associated with betteroutcome (disease-free survival). In summary, our data indicate that miR-205 couldpredict Trastuzumab efficacy and that its modulation might be useful as adjuvant treatment to improve the response to the drug.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24723 PMCID: PMC6021348PMID: 29963251
