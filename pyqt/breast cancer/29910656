However, aftertraditional first-line endocrine monotherapy treatment, the disease typicallyprogresses despite the initial high rate of clinical benefit. Multiple studieshave aimed at optimizing treatment strategies to improve upon clinical benefitbeyond the traditional single-agent endocrine treatment. With the availability ofnew data and novel therapies, the clinical practice challenge becomes how best todefine the optimal treatment sequence to maximize clinical benefit. In thisreview, we present treatment options clinically relevant to the management ofhormone-positive, her2-negative metastatic breast cancer, and we propose atreatment algorithm based on the current literature.DOI: 10.3747/co.25.4000 PMCID: PMC6001771PMID: 29910656
