However, the mechanisms for the formation of M2-like TAMs remain enigmatic. Here, we show thatlactate is a pivotal oncometabolite in the TME that drives macrophageM2-polarization to promote breast cancer proliferation, migration, andangiogenesis. In addition, we identified that the activation of ERK/STAT3, major signaling molecules in the lactate signaling pathway, deepens our molecularunderstanding of how lactate educates TAMs. Moreover, suppression of ERK/STAT3signaling diminished tumor growth and angiogenesis by abolishing lactate-induced M2 macrophage polarization. Finally, research data of the natural compoundwithanolide D provide evidence for ERK/STAT3 signaling as a potential therapeuticstrategy for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. These findingssuggest that the lactate-ERK/STAT3 signaling pathway is a driver of breast cancerprogression by stimulating macrophage M2-like polarization and reveal potentialnew therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1080/15384101.2018.1444305 PMCID: PMC5927648 [Available on 2019-03-27]PMID: 29468929
