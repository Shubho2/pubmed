Accordingly, most patients receive systemic treatments although approximately 40%of these patients may have been cured by surgery and radiotherapy alone. Twostudies identified seven prognostic microRNAs in systemically untreated, LNnegative and ER positive breast cancer patients which may allow more precisepatient classification. However, six of the seven microRNAs were analyzed in bothstudies but only found to be prognostic in one study. To validate theirprognostic potential, we analyzed microRNA expression in an independent cohort (n= 110) using a pair-matched study design minimizing dependence of classicalmarkers. The expression of hsa-miR-548c-5p was significantly associated withabridged disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]:1.96, p = 0.027). Contradictingpublished results, high hsa-miR-516-3p expression was associated with favorableoutcome (HR:0.29, p = 0.0068). The association is probably time-dependentindicating later relapse. Additionally, re-analysis of previously publishedexpression data of two matching cohorts (n = 100, n = 255) supports anassociation of hsa-miR-128-3p with shortened disease-free survival (HR:2.48, p = 0.0033) and an upregulation of miR-7-5p (p = 0.0038; p = 0.039) and miR-210-3p (p= 0.031) in primary tumors of patients who experienced metastases. Furtheranalysis may verify the prognostic potential of these microRNAs.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24088 PMCID: PMC5823652PMID: 29507672
