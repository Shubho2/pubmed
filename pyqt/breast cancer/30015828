In thepresent study, the anticancer effects of alantolactone, a sesquiterpene lactone, on the human breast cancer cell line MCF‑7 were investigated in vitro. The MCF‑7 cell morphology changed from diamond to round subsequent to treatment withalantolactone, and the cell viability reduced significantly compared with that ofthe control cells. Alantolactone induced apoptosis of MCF‑7 cells by regulatingthe protein expression levels of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2), Bcl‑2‑associatedX protein, p53, caspase‑3 and caspase‑12, which are associated with the apoptoticpathway, and suppressed colony formation and migration by regulating the protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2, MMP‑7 and MMP‑9. Cell signalingpathway analysis confirmed that alantolactone increased the phosphorylation ofp38, and decreased the nuclear expression levels of p65 and nuclear factorerythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2), suggesting that the apoptosis‑promoting and migration‑suppressing effect of alantolactone may partially depend on regulating the p38 MAPK, NF‑κB and Nrf2 pathways. These results also suggested thatalantolactone may become a potential therapeutic strategy for treating breastcancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3751 PMID: 30015828
