We previously isolated subsets of 4T1murine breast cancer cells which metastasized to liver (4TLM), brain (4TBM), and heart (4THM). Among these cells, 4TLM is the most aggressive one, demonstratingmesenchymal phenotype. Here we compared secreted proteins from 4TLM, 4TBM, and4THM cells and compared with that of hardly metastatic 67NR cells to detectdifferentially secreted factors involved in organ-specific metastasis.METHOD AND RESULTS: Label-free LC-MS/MS proteomic technique was used to detectthe differentially secreted proteins. Eighty-five of over 500 secreted proteinswere significantly altered in metastatic breast cancer cells. Differentialexpression of several proteins such as fibulin-4, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 1,TGF-β1 MMP-3, MMP-9, and Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin were further verified usingELISA or Western blotting. Many of these identified proteins were also present inhuman metastatic breast carcinomas. Annexin A1 and A5, laminin beta 1, Neutralalpha-glucosidase AB were commonly found at least in three out of six studiesexamined here. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that proteins differentiallysecreted from metastatic cells are involved primarily in carcinogenesis andTGF-β1 is the top upstream regulator in all metastatic cells.CONCLUSIONS: Cells metastasized to different organs displayed significantdifferences in several of secreted proteins. Proteins differentially altered werefibronectin, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, andProcollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1. On the other hand, manyexosomal proteins were also common to all metastatic cells, demonstratinginvolvement of key universal factors in distant metastatic process.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4752-8 PMID: 29557524
