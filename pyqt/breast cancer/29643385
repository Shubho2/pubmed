Here we describe a novelsynthetic retinoid, namely WYC-209, which inhibits proliferation of malignantmurine melanoma tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs), known to resist conventionaldrug treatment, with an IC50 of 0.19 μM in a dose-dependent manner. WYC-209 also inhibits proliferation of TRCs of human melanoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer,and breast cancer in culture. Interestingly, the treated TRCs fail to resumegrowth even after the drug washout. Importantly, the molecule abrogates 87.5% of lung metastases of melanoma TRCs in immune-competent wild-type C57BL/6 mice at0.22 mg kg-1 without showing apparent toxicity. Pretreating the melanoma TRCswith retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonists or with RAR siRNAs blocks orreduces the inhibitory effect of the molecule, suggesting that the target of the molecule is RAR. WYC-209 induces TRC apoptosis and pretreating the TRCs withcaspase 3 inhibitor or depleting caspase 3 with siRNAs substantially rescuesgrowth of TRCs from WYC-209 inhibition, suggesting that WYC-209 induces TRCsapoptosis primarily via the caspase 3 pathway. Our findings demonstrate thepromise of the new retinoid WYC-209 in treating malignant melanoma tumors withhigh efficacy and little toxicity.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03877-7 PMCID: PMC5895803PMID: 29643385
