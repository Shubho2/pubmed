Theinterpretation of results from previous studies on breast density and survival iscomplicated by the association between detection mode and survival. Here, westudied the effect of breast density on breast cancer-specific survival fordifferent detection modes (screen-detected, interval ≤ 24 or > 24 months,non-participant).METHODS: Data from the Nijmegen (Dutch) breast cancer screening programme wereused. Women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1975 and 2011 wereincluded. Breast density was assessed visually, based on a dichotomized Wolfescale: 'fatty breasts' (≤25%) and 'dense breasts' (> 25%). Cox proportionalhazard regression was used to obtain hazard ratios (HR).RESULTS: We identified 2742 eligible women, with a breast pattern available for2233 women. A diagnosis of interval cancer (HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.62-2.61) led to asignificantly increased risk of breast cancer death compared with screen-detectedcancer. No significant cause-specific survival difference between women withdense and fatty breasts was observed (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77-1.15). The hazard was only higher for women with dense breasts among interval cancers ≤24 m (HR 1.07,95% CI 0.74-1.56). The hazard appeared to be lower for women with dense breaststhan for women with fatty breasts among screen-detected (HR 0.77, 95% CI0.53-1.11) and interval cancers > 24 m (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.53-1.20). None of theeffects were statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Detection mode is strongly associated with breast cancer death. Noclear association is apparent between breast density and breast cancer death,regardless of detection mode.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4316-7 PMCID: PMC5885304PMID: 29618328
