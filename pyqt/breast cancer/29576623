However, the ability of OT todistinguish breast tumours displaying different vascular characteristics has yet to be established. The aim of the study is to prove OT as a sensitive techniquefor differentiating breast tumour models with manifestly different vasculatures.METHODS: Multispectral OT (MSOT) was performed in oestrogen-dependent (MCF-7) andoestrogen-independent (MDA-MB-231) orthotopic breast cancer xenografts. Totalhaemoglobin (THb) and oxygen saturation (SO2MSOT) were calculated. Pathologicaland biochemical evaluation of the tumour vascular phenotype was performed forvalidation.RESULTS: MCF-7 tumours show SO2MSOT similar to healthy tissue in both rim andcore, despite significantly lower THb in the core. MDA-MB-231 tumours showmarkedly lower SO2MSOT with a significant rim-core disparity. Ex vivo analysisrevealed that MCF-7 tumours contain fewer blood vessels (CD31+) that are moremature (CD31+/aSMA+) than MDA-MB-231. MCF-7 presented higher levels of stromalVEGF and iNOS, with increased NO serum levels. The vasculogenic process observed in MCF-7 was consistent with angiogenesis, while MDA-MB-231 appeared to rely moreon vascular mimicry.CONCLUSIONS: OT is sensitive to differences in the vascular phenotypes of ourbreast cancer models.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0033-x PMCID: PMC5931091PMID: 29576623
