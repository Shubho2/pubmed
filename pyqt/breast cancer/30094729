Theaims of this study were to analyze the prevalence and sociodemographic andmedical risk factors of clinical distress. Additionally, we also explore therelationship between unmet psychosocial needs and both clinical distress andsubgroups of survival periods.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 450 women who at least 1 month before hadcompleted the primary treatment for breast cancer was conducted. The BriefSymptom Inventory 18 and the Cancer Survivors Unmet Needs measure were used.RESULTS: One in four women showed clinical distress related to unmet psychosocialneeds. None of the sociodemographic and medical predictors was associated withclinical distress. Needs focused on the possibility of recurrence and itscognitive-emotional impact were the most frequent. Needs tended to decreasethrough periods of survival; however, there was a considerable level of unmetneeds even among long-term survivors.CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the relevance of extending psychosocial care beyond the breast cancer primary medical treatment. Early and regular screen for distress and unmet supportive needs permits to identify high-risk groups thatlikely benefit from targeted preventive interventions.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4394-8 PMID: 30094729
