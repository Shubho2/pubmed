[Epub ahead ofprint]Cytotoxic flavonoids from two Lonchocarpus species.Adem FA(1)(2), Kuete V(2)(3), Mbaveng AT(2)(3), Heydenreich M(4), Koch A(4),Ndakala A(1), Irungu B(5), Yenesew A(1), Efferth T(2).Author information: (1)a Department of Chemistry , University of Nairobi , Nairobi , Kenya.(2)b Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University , Mainz , Germany.(3)c Faculty of Science, Department of Biochemistry , University of Dschang ,Dschang , Cameroon.(4)d Institute of Chemistry , University of Potsdam , Potsdam , Germany.(5)e Centre for Traditional Medicine and Drug Research , Kenya Medical ResearchInstitute , Nairobi , Kenya.A new isoflavone, 4'-prenyloxyvigvexin A (1) and a new pterocarpan,(6aR,11aR)-3,8-dimethoxybitucarpin B (2) were isolated from the leaves ofLonchocarpus bussei and the stem bark of Lonchocarpus eriocalyx, respectively.The extract of L. bussei also gave four known isoflavones, maximaisoflavone H,7,2'-dimethoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyisoflavone,6,7,3'-trimethoxy-4',5'-methylenedioxyisoflavone, durmillone; a chalcone,4-hydroxylonchocarpin; a geranylated phenylpropanol, colenemol; and two knownpterocarpans, (6aR,11aR)-maackiain and (6aR,11aR)-edunol. (6aR,11aR)-Edunol wasalso isolated from the stem bark of L. eriocalyx. The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was tested by resazurin assay using drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant cancercell lines. Significant antiproliferative effects with IC50 values below 10 μMwere observed for the isoflavones6,7,3'-trimethoxy-4',5'-methylenedioxyisoflavone and durmillone against leukemia CCRF-CEM cells; for the chalcone, 4-hydroxylonchocarpin and durmillone againstits resistant counterpart CEM/ADR5000 cells; as well as for durmillone againstthe resistant breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB231/BCRP cells and resistantgliobastoma U87MG.ΔEGFR cells.DOI: 10.1080/14786419.2018.1462179 PMID: 29656660
