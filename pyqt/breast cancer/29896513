Jarc et al.,Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1863 (2018) 247-265. Elevated uptake of unsaturated fatty acids and lipid droplet accumulation are characteristic of aggressive cancercells and have been associated with the cellular stress response. The presentstudy provides lipidomic data on the triacylglycerol (TAG) andphosphatidylcholine (PC) composition of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells exposed todocosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6, ω-3). Datasets provide information on thechanges in lipid composition induced by depletion of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and by exogenous addition of secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) inDHA-treated cells. The presented alterations in lipid composition, mediated bytargeting lipid droplet biogenesis and lipolysis, are associated with protection from lipotoxicity and allow further investigation into the role of lipid dropletsin the resistance of cancer cells to lipotoxic stress.DOI: 10.1016/j.dib.2018.03.033 PMCID: PMC5996238PMID: 29896513
