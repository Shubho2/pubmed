However, under certain conditions,DCs can exert tumoricidal activity. We have elucidated the mechanism of tumorsuppression by TLR4-activated bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) isolated fromBALB/c mice. We identified that two distinct subsets of BMDCs(CD11b+CD11c+I-A/Eint and CD11b+CD11c+I-A/Ehigh) have different cytotoxicmechanisms of action. The cytotoxicity of the former subset is mediated throughNO and reactive oxygen species and type I IFN (IFN-β), whereas the latter subset acts only through IFN-β. TLR4 agonists, LPS or pharmaceutical-grade ImmunoMax,activate CD11c+ BMDCs, which, in turn, directly kill 4T1 mouse breast cancercells or inhibit their proliferation in an MHC-independent manner. These datadefine two populations of BMDCs with different mechanisms of direct cytotoxicity,as well as suggest that the I-A/Eint subset could be less susceptible tocounteracting mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and support investigation of similar subsets in human DCs.Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.1701126 PMCID: PMC5962282 [Available on 2019-04-15]PMID: 29500244
