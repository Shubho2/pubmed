Evidence exists to support replacing photon therapy withproton therapy to reduce the incidence of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) inchildhood cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to estimate thepotential reduction in SMN incidence and in SMN mortality for pediatricmedulloblastoma patients in LMICs if proton therapy were made available to them. For nine children of ages 2 to 14 years, we calculated the equivalent dose inorgans or tissues at risk for radiogenic SMNs from therapeutic and strayradiation for photon craniospinal irradiation (CSI) in a LMIC and proton CSI in ahigh-income country. We projected the lifetime risks of SMN incidence and SMNmortality for every SMN site with a widely-used model from the literature. Wefound that the average total lifetime attributable risks of incidence andmortality were very high for both photon CSI (168% and 41%, respectively) andproton CSI (88% and 26%, respectively). SMNs having the highest risk of mortalitywere lung cancer (16%), non-site-specific solid tumors (16%), colon cancer(5.9%), leukemia (5.4%), and for girls breast cancer (5.0%) after photon CSI and non-site-specific solid tumors (12%), lung cancer (11%), and leukemia (4.8%)after proton CSI. The risks were higher for younger children than for olderchildren and higher for girls than for boys. The ratios of proton CSI to photonCSI of total risks of SMN incidence and mortality were 0.56 (95% CI, 0.37 to0.75) and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.82), respectively, averaged over this samplegroup. In conclusion, proton therapy has the potential to lessen markedlysubsequent SMNs and SMN fatalities in survivors of childhood medulloblastoma inLMICs, for example, through regional centralized care. Additional methods should be explored urgently to reduce therapeutic-field doses in organs and tissues atrisk for SMN, especially in the lungs, colon, and breast tissues.DOI: 10.1088/2057-1976/aaa1ce PMCID: PMC6054490 [Available on 2019-02-07]PMID: 30038799
