However, thepharmacological evidence has not been fully revealed.Results: Erlotinib distribution in the rashes was more heterogeneous than that inthe normal skin, and the rashes contained statistically higher concentrations of erlotinib than adjacent normal skin in the superficial skin layer (229 ± 192 vs. 120 ± 103 ions/mm2; P = 0.009 in paired t-test). LC-MS/MS confirmed that theconcentration of erlotinib in the skin rashes was higher than that in normal skinin the superficial skin layer (1946 ± 1258 vs. 1174 ± 662 ng/cm3; P = 0.028 inpaired t-test). The results of MALDI-MSI and LC-MS/MS were well correlated(coefficient of correlation 0.879, P < 0.0001).Conclusions: Focal distribution of erlotinib in the skin tissue was visualizedusing non-labeled MALDI-MSI. Erlotinib concentration in the superficial layer of the skin rashes was higher than that in the adjacent normal skin.Methods: We examined patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who developed skin rashes after treatment with erlotinib and gemcitabine. We biopsied both the rash and adjacent normal skin tissues, and visualized and compared the distribution oferlotinib within the skin using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). The tissue concentration of erlotinib was also measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with laser microdissection.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24928 PMCID: PMC5915091PMID: 29719624
