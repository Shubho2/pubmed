Changes in theregulation of intracellular Ca2+ and specific components of Ca2+ influx are afeature of several cancers and/or cancer subtypes, including the basal-likebreast cancer subtype, which has a poor prognosis. The development of geneticallyencoded calcium indicators, such as GCaMP6, represents an opportunity to measure changes in intracellular free Ca2+ during processes relevant to breast cancerprogression that occur over long periods (e.g. hours), such as cell death. Thisstudy describes the development of a MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line stablyexpressing GCaMP6m. The cell line retained the key features of this aggressivebasal-like breast cancer cell line. Using this model, we defined alterations inrelative cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]CYT) when the cells were treated withC2-ceramide. Cell death was measured simultaneously via assessment of propidiumiodide permeability. Treatment with ceramide produced delayed and heterogeneoussustained increases in [Ca2+]CYT. Where cell death occurred, [Ca2+]CYT increases preceded cell death. The sustained increases in [Ca2+]CYT were not related to therapid morphological changes induced by ceramide. Silencing of the plasma membraneCa2+ ATPase isoform 1 (PMCA1) was associated with an augmentation inceramide-induced increases in [Ca2+]CYT and also cell death. This workdemonstrates the utility of GCaMP6 Ca2+ indicators for investigating [Ca2+]CYTchanges in breast cancer cells during events relevant to tumor progression, whichoccur over hours rather than minutes.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
