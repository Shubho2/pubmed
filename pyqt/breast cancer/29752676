Drawing on 26 in-depthinterviews with patients with breast or ovarian cancer who had undergone TFGT,this retrospective study examines patients' views of genetic testing at thispoint in their care pathway, focusing on issues, such as initial response to the offer of testing, motivations for undergoing testing, and views on care pathways.Patients were amenable to the incorporation of TFGT at an early stage in theircancer care irrespective of (any) prior anticipation of having a genetic test or family history. While patients were glad to have been offered TFGT as part oftheir care, some questioned the logic of the test's timing in relation to theircancer treatment. Crucially, patients appeared unable to disentangle thetreatment role of TFGT from its preventative function for self and other familymembers, suggesting that some may undergo TFGT to obtain information for othersrather than for self.DOI: 10.1007/s10897-018-0261-5 PMID: 29752676
