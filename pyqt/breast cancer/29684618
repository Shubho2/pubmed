Electronic address: r.baldelli@scf.gov.it.In the last few years, molecular targeted therapies have replaced traditionalcytotoxic chemotherapy in the fight against many cancers to the extent that ourunderstanding of tumor biology has become more sophisticated. This shift hasmarkedly changed adverse event profiles, compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy,affecting a diverse range of organ systems. Everolimus was approved by the FDA in2011 for the treatment of progressive pancreatic NE tumors. It is an inhibitor ofmammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and exhibits antitumor activity viadisruption of various signaling pathways and it's used in the treatment ofadvanced renal cell cancer, breast cancer and neuroendocrine tumors (NET); it'sused also as anti-rejection agent for transplantation but with lower doses foranti-rejection (1.5-3.0 mg/day) than for anti-cancer (5-10 mg/day) treatment.Metabolic side effects are the most frequent reported and will be discussed inthis review.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
