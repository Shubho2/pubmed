Hence, we performed acomprehensive meta-analysis to quantitatively investigate the association betweenCTLA-4 polymorphisms (rs231775, rs4553808，rs5742909, rs3087243 or rs733618) andcancer risk.METHODS: Data were collected from PubMed and Web of Science. A total of 67case-control studies were selected for quantitative analysis. Stata (Version 12) software was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval(CI) to evaluate the strength of the associations. Subgroup meta-analysis wasconducted based on ethnicity and cancer type. Heterogeneity tests, sensitivityanalysis, and publication bias assessments were also performed.RESULTS: rs231775, rs4553808 and rs5742909 but not rs3087243 and rs733618 weresignificantly related to cancer risk. In analyses stratified by ethnicity, bothrs231775 and rs4553808 were significant susceptibility polymorphisms in an Asian population but not in a Caucasian population. Moreover, there were strongerassociations between the rs231775 polymorphism and increased risk of bone,breast, liver, head and neck and pancreatic cancers. Additionally, rs4553808 was associated with significantly increased susceptibility to breast cancer and head and neck cancer.CONCLUSION: rs231775, rs4553808 and rs5742909 may be used as predictive geneticbiomarkers for cancer predisposition. Combined detection of CTLA-4 SNPs could be a useful tool for prediction of cancer susceptibility in clinical practice.© 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.
