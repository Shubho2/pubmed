This meta-analysis synthesizes data from 19 randomized clinical trialsin order to: (a) provide an estimation of overall effect of CBI in breast cancer patients during treatment for breast cancer, i.e., neo-adjuvant and adjuvanttreatment; (b) provide average effect sizes on side effects of treatment,distress, and quality of life; and (c) test possible moderators of effect size.The results show that CBI yielded a small effect size overall, specifically ongeneral side effects of treatment, nausea, vomiting, distress, and quality oflife. Individual and behavioral interventions seem to elicit better results ondistress and on general side effects of treatment, respectively. While morestudies are needed with regard to specific side effects (i.e., fatigue, pain, andsleep disturbance), the overall results clearly support the use of CBI in breast cancer patients during treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s10880-017-9526-7 PMID: 29480435
