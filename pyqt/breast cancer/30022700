[Epub aheadof print]Temperature-sensitive liposomes for codelivery of tamoxifen and imatinib forsynergistic breast cancer treatment.Jose A(1), Ninave KM(1), Karnam S(1), Venuganti VVK(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Pharmacy , Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS)Pilani, Hyderabad Campus , Shameerpet , Hyderabad - 500078 , India.Co-delivery of chemotherapeutic agents using nanocarriers is a promising strategyfor enhancing therapeutic efficacy of anticancer agents. The aim of this work wasto develop tamoxifen and imatinib dual drug loaded temperature-sensitiveliposomes to treat breast cancer. Liposomes were prepared using 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC),monopalmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (MPPC) and different surface active agents. The liposomes were characterized for the average particle size,zeta-potential, transition temperature and drug release below and above liposomaltransition temperature. The temperature-sensitive liposomes co-encapsulated with tamoxifen and imatinib were investigated for their synergistic activity againstMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The liposomal nanoparticles showed atransition temperature of 39.4°C and >70% encapsulation efficiency for tamoxifen and imatinib. The temperature-responsive liposomes showed more than 80% drugreleased within 30 min above transition temperature. Dual drug loaded liposomesshowed synergistic growth inhibition against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancercells. Co-delivery of tamoxifen and imatinib using temperature-sensitiveliposomes can be developed as a potential targeting strategy against breastcancer.DOI: 10.1080/08982104.2018.1502315 PMID: 30022700
