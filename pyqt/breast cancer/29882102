As a protracted low-dose infusion, 5FU is antiangiogenic, and has synergy with bevacizumab. As shown in the treatment of breast cancer,bevacizumab and nab-paclitaxel are also synergetic.OBJECTIVE: In this paper we retrospectively analyze the survival of 65 patientswith advanced pancreatic cancer who were treated with low-dose continuous(metronomic) chemotherapy given in conjunction with conventional anti-VEGFtherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since July of 2008, we have treated 65 patients with 5FU(180 mg/m2/day × 14 days) via an ambulatory pump. Calcium leucovorin (20 mg/m2IV), nab-paclitaxel (60 mg/m2) IV as a 30-min infusion, and oxaliplatin(50 mg/m2) IV as a 60-min infusion were given on days 1, 8, and 15. Bevacizumab(5 mg/kg) IV over 30 min was administered on days 1 and 15. Cycles were repeated every 28-35 days. There were 42 women and 23 men, and the median age was 59years. Forty-six patients had stage IV disease.RESULTS: The median survival was 19 months, with 82% of patients surviving12 months or longer. The overall response rate was 49%. There were 28 patientswho had received prior treatment, 15 of whom responded to therapy. Fifty-twopatients had elevated CA 19-9 prior to treatment. Of these, 21 patients had 90%or greater reduction in CA 19-9 levels. This cohort had an objective responserate of 71% and a median survival of 27 months. Thirty patients stopped treatmentdue to disease progression, and an additional 22 stopped because of toxicity. Onepatient died while on therapy.CONCLUSIONS: This non-gemcitabine-based regimen resulted in higher response ratesand better survival than what is commonly observed with therapy given atconventional dosing schedules. Low-dose continuous (metronomic therapy) cytotoxicchemotherapy combined with antiangiogenic therapy is safe and effective.DOI: 10.1007/s11523-018-0572-3 PMID: 29882102
