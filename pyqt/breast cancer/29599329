This study aimedto assess the clinicopathological factors that predict non-SLN metastasis todefine subgroups of SLN-positive patients in whom the axilla may be staged by SLNbiopsy alone, while avoiding unnecessary overtreatment.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 191 patients with histologically-provenprimary BC who underwent a positive (SLN) biopsy between 2005 and 2017 werereviewed. Patients with at least one tumor-involved SLN who underwent completion ALND were enrolled. Demographic and clinicopathological characteristics,including age, primary tumor size and histological grade, lymphovascularinvasion, ratio of positive SLNs to the harvested SLNs, SLN metastasis size, and molecular subtype classification according to immunohistochemical biomarkerstatus [estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2)], were evaluated. Data were collectedretrospectively and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests(statistical significance: p<0.05).RESULTS: The incidence of non-SLN metastasis associated with positive SLN was48.6% (93/191). The risk of additional nodal spread correlated with high sentinelnodal ratio >0.67 [odds ratio (OR)=2.55, p=0.032], luminal BC subtype (OR=2.67,p=0.06), HER2 overexpression (OR=0.4, p=0.016), and ER+PR-HER2- profile (OR=2.95,p=0.027). There was a tendency (statistically insignificant; p>0.05) towardhigher incidence of non SLN metastasis with increasing age and histologicalgrade, which could be attributed to the small sample size.CONCLUSION: According to this study, sentinel nodal ratio and BC subtypes as per ER, PR, and HER2 status significantly predicted the likelihood of additionallymphatic involvement. Validation of these parameters in prospective studies isindicated, and may help individualize treatment modalities.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12451 PMID: 29599329  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
