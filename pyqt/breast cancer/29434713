China.The main problem in breast cancer treatment is the recurrence of tumor growth andmetastases. Previous studies have suggested that Paclitaxel is widely used totreat various cancers. The present study analyzed the potential signaling pathwayof Paclitaxel-inhibited breast cancer metastasis. It was demonstrated thatPaclitaxel treatment significantly inhibited growth of breast cancer cell linesincluding MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells. Results demonstrated that Paclitaxelsignificantly inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Resultsadditionally demonstrated that Paclitaxel treatment suppressed Aurora kinase and cofilin-1 activity in breast cancer cells. The potential mechanism indicated thatactivation of Aurora kinase activity stimulated cofilin-1 activity, whichcanceled Paclitaxel-inhibited growth and aggressiveness of breast cancer cells.An in vivo assay revealed that Paclitaxel treatment significantly inhibitedbreast cancer growth. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that Paclitaxel treatmentincreased apoptosis of tumor cells in tumor tissue. Notably, Aurora kinase andcofilin-1 activity were downregulated by Paclitaxel in tumor tissues. Inconclusion, these results indicated that Paclitaxel inhibited breast cancer cell growth and metastasis via suppression of Aurora kinase-mediated cofilin-1activity, suggesting Paclitaxel may be an efficient anticancer agent for thetreatment of this disease.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2017.5588 PMCID: PMC5776659PMID: 29434713
