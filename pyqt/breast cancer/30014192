Items measured were (1) knowledge about self-care; (2) the CancerFatigue Scale; (3) social-cognitive factors in the theory of planned behaviour(attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control); (4) self-care(limb hygiene, observation, articular movement, recommended risk-reductionbehaviours in daily life, and diet and weight control); and (5) demographics. Of 202 respondents, 147 who had not been diagnosed with lymphoedema were eligiblefor statistical analysis (65.3% with gynaecological cancer, 34.7% with breastcancer).RESULTS: Structural equation modelling was used to examine a hypothesised modelbased on the theory of planned behaviour. The results revealed that a longer timesince surgery, higher levels of fatigue, less knowledge, higher expected efficacyof self-care, and lower perceived behavioural control directly and significantly predicted less self-care behaviour.CONCLUSIONS: Besides education about self-care behaviour, levels of fatigue andperceived behavioural control should be taken into account to encourage femalepatients with cancer to perform self-care after discharge. Continuouspsycho-educational programmes after discharge may help to facilitate self-carebehaviours among long-term female cancer survivors.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4349-0 PMID: 30014192
