The mechanisms driving CDCP1 over-expression are not fully understood, althoughseveral stimuli derived from tumor microenvironment, such as factors present inWound Healing Fluids (WHFs), reportedly increase CDCP1 levels.METHODS: The expression of CDCP1, PDGFRβ and ERK1/2cell was tested by Westernblot after stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cells with PDGF-BB and, similarly, inpresence or not of ERK1/2 inhibitor in a panel of TNBC cell lines. Knock-down of PDGFRβ was established in MDA-MB-231 cells to detect CDCP1 upon WHF treatment.Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression of CDCP1 andPDGFRβ in TNBC clinical samples.RESULTS: We discovered that PDGF-BB-mediated activation of PDGFRβ increases CDCP1protein expression through the downstream activation of ERK1/2. Inhibition ofERK1/2 activity reduced per se CDCP1 expression, evidence strengthening its role in CDCP1 expression regulation. Knock-down of PDGFRβ in TNBC cells impaired CDCP1increase induced by WHF treatment, highlighting the role if this receptor as acentral player of the WHF-mediated CDCP1 induction. A significant associationbetween CDCP1 and PDGFRβ immunohistochemical staining was observed in TNBCspecimens, independently of CDCP1 gene gain, thus corroborating the relevance of the PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ axis in the modulation of CDCP1 expression.CONCLUSION: We have identified PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ-mediated pathway as a novel player in the regulation of CDCP1 in TNCBs through ERK1/2 activation. Our resultsprovide the basis for the potential use of PDGFRβ and ERK1/2 inhibitors intargeting the aggressive features of CDCP1-positive TNBCs.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4500-9 PMCID: PMC5967041PMID: 29792166
