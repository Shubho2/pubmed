Therefore, differentialdiagnosis of metastatic ALN is highly desirable in the clinic. We used real-time elastography (RTE) and gray-scale ultrasound to generate a new scoring system fordetermining ALN status and estimate their performance of this system.Ninety-seven ALNs were examined by both gray-scale ultrasound and RTE. Theperformance of gray-scale ultrasound was evaluated by the sum of scores accordingto its features. RTE images were determined by a modulated scoring system basedon the percentage and distribution of hypoechoic cortex regions in the ALNs.Strain ratio was also calculated. Diagnostic performance was obtained by receiveroperating characteristic curve analysis with pathologic findings used as thereference standard. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 92%, 73% and83%, respectively, for gray-scale ultrasound; 78%, 93%, 86%, respectively, forRTE; 88%, 96% and 92%, respectively, for the combined evaluation (AUC = 0.963),and 87%, 76% and 81%, respectively, for strain ratio. Gray-scale ultrasonography had a better sensitivity than RTE (92% vs 78%, P = 0.039), while the specificity for RTE was superior to that of gray-scale ultrasonography (93% vs 73%,P = 0.012). In conclusion, RTE showed a high specificity for evaluating the ALNstatus and may improve the diagnostic accuracy when combined with gray-scaleultrasound.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-28474-y PMCID: PMC6035225PMID: 29980694
