Recent studies suggest that cancer stem cells play animportant role in tumorigenesis and tumor biology of TNBC. Both CD44+/CD24- andALDH1+ breast cancer stem cells are enriched in TNBC and may contribute to thepropensity of TNBC for chemotherapy resistance and tumor metastasis. There is newevidence to support the evaluation of cancer stem cells in TNBC for diagnosticpurposes. Targeting cancer stem cells may also be a promising, novel strategy forthe treatment of TNBC. This review highlights the current understanding of breastcancer stem cells in TNBC, with focus on CD44+/CD24- and ALDH1+ breast cancerstem cells. It is our hope that this work provides insight into the potentialrole of cancer stem cells in the prognostication and therapeutic targeting ofTNBC.DOI: 10.2217/bmm-2017-0398 PMID: 29902924
