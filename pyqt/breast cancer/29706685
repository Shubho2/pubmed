Electronic health records (EHRs) represent an underuseddata source that has great research and clinical potential. Our goal was toquantify the value of EHR variables in the "most harmful" breast cancer riskprediction. We identified 794 subjects who had breast cancer with primarynon-benign tumors with their earliest diagnosis on or after 1/1/2004 from anexisting personalized medicine data repository, including 395 "most harmful"breast cancer cases and 399 "least harmful" breast cancer cases. For thesesubjects, we collected EHR data comprised of 6 components: demographics,diagnoses, symptoms, procedures, medications, and laboratory results. Wedeveloped two regularized prediction models, Ridge Logistic Regression (Ridge-LR)and Lasso Logistic Regression (Lasso-LR), to predict the "most harmful" breastcancer one year in advance. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to assessmodel performance. We observed that the AUCs of Ridge-LR and Lasso-LR models were0.818 and 0.839 respectively. For both the Ridge-LR and Lasso-LR models, thepredictive performance of the whole EHR variables was significantly higher thanthat of each individual component (p<0.001). In conclusion, EHR variables can be used to predict the "most harmful" breast cancer, providing the possibility topersonalize care for those women at the highest risk in clinical practice.DOI: 10.1117/12.2293954 PMCID: PMC5914175PMID: 29706685
