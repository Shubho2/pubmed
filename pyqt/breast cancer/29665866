As a firststep, we measured LTL and mtDNA copy number in 96 individuals for which a bloodsample had been collected twice with an interval of 15 years.RESULTS: According to the intraclass correlation (ICC), we found very goodstability over the time period for both measurements, with ICCs of 0.63 for LTLand 0.60 for mtDNA copy number. In the analysis of the entire study sample, weobserved that longer LTL was strongly associated with increased risk of BC (OR2.71, 95% CI 1.58-4.65, p = 3.07 × 10- 4 for highest vs. lowest quartile; OR3.20, 95% CI 1.57-6.55, p = 1.41 × 10- 3 as a continuous variable). We did notfind any association between mtDNA copy number and BC risk; however, whenconsidering only the functional copies, we observed an increased risk ofdeveloping estrogen receptor-positive BC (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.05-5.80, p = 0.04 forhighest vs. lowest quartile).CONCLUSIONS: We observed a very good correlation between the markers over aperiod of 15 years. We confirm a role of LTL in BC carcinogenesis and suggest an effect of mtDNA copy number on BC risk.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0955-5 PMCID: PMC5905156PMID: 29665866
