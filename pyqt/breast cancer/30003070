The objective of the presentsystematic review was to evaluate whether implant location influenced thecharacteristics of breast tumors in previously augmented women.Methods: A systematic literature search was performed to identify relevantarticles reporting tumor characteristics in augmented patients. The searchincluded published articles in three electronic databases; Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed. Comparative studies (subglandular vs. subpectoral) were included.Results: Analysis of data pooled from the included studies showed thatsubglandular implants had a higher frequency of tumors between 2 to 5 cm (26.5%vs. 9.9%, P = 0.0130). Subglandular implants also had a higher frequency of stage2 tumors (42.9% vs. 23.7%, P = 0.0308). There was no significant difference inlymphovascular invasion between the 2 groups. These results of this systematicreview suggest that the prognosis of patients undergoing augmentation isunaffected by implant location (subpectoral vs. subglandular).Conclusions: With the absence of large randomized controlled trials, our studyprovides surgeons with an evidence-based reference to improve informed consentwith regards to implant placement.DOI: 10.15430/JCP.2018.23.2.93 PMCID: PMC6037212PMID: 30003070
