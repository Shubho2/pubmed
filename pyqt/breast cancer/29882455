This would warrant a significant change inpractice, yet the acceptability from a woman's perspective has never beensystematically explored. In this systematic review, we inventoried and appraised studies of women's perceptions of risk-based breast cancer screening andprevention to identify factors associated with adopting this new paradigm.METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and PsycInfo to identify original articlesin English containing perceptions of risk-based breast cancer screening and/orprimary prevention of women with an average to above average risk of developingbreast cancer. Qualitative data were systematically extracted and referencedagainst four theoretical models of preventative health behaviour adoption.RESULTS: When considering the adoption of this novel screening and preventionprogramme, women carefully review their perceived susceptibility to breastcancer. Their decisions are based on a cost-benefit analysis of adoptinglifestyle changes, chemoprevention, or prophylactic surgery, taking into account their perceived competence, individual autonomy, relatedness to others, andpersonal preference. The role of intent is limited when considering behaviouralchange.CONCLUSIONS: Implementing risk-based breast cancer screening and prevention will require a multifactorial approach. The transition from theory to practice can be supported by developing evidence-based shared decision aids and family-oriented(genetic) counselling programmes.DOI: 10.1080/0284186X.2018.1481291 PMID: 29882455
