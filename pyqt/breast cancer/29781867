[Epubahead of print]ACCELERATED ONSET OF RETINAL TOXICITY FROM HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE USE WITHCONCOMITANT BREAST CANCER THERAPY.Sharma A(1), Maiz AM, Tucker WR, Cukras C.Author information: (1)National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.PURPOSE: To report a case of accelerated retinal toxicity due tohydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use for treatment of Sjögren syndrome in a patienttreated with concomitant chemotherapy for breast cancer.METHODS: Observational case report.RESULTS: A 56-year-old white woman using 400 mg HCQ (7.1 mg/kg real body weight) daily for a total of 2 years and 10 months for treatment of Sjögren syndrome withconcomitant use of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide therapy (21-day cycle, 4cycles) followed by anastrozole for breast cancer, presented with visualcomplaints and findings of severe HCQ toxicity.CONCLUSION: Concomitant breast cancer therapy may have a synergistic effect with HCQ leading to accelerated retinal toxicity. As such potential acceleration ispoorly understood, patients on HCQ who are treated with concomitant chemotherapy should be considered for more frequent retinal screenings to maximize safety and preservation of vision.DOI: 10.1097/ICB.0000000000000742 PMID: 29781867
