Aberrant expression of miR-20a-5p has been reported in human breast carcinoma. However, the functional mechanism ofmiR-20a-5p in human breast carcinoma, particularly in triple-negative breastcancer (TNBC), required further investigations. Here, firstly, we determined thatmiR-20a-5p was highly expressed in both TNBC tissues and cell lines. Then, weexplored that the overexpression of miR-20a-5p promoted the migration andinvasion of TNBC cells in vitro. The tendency was significantly reversed afterthe depletion of miR-20a-5p. Consistent result could be obtained with the in vivonude mice tumorigenesis. Thirdly, the underlying molecular mechanism wasinvestigated. The Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) was identified as atarget of miR-20a-5p in TNBC cells. High expression of miR-20a-5p significantlydecreased both the mRNA and protein levels of RUNX3, as well as its directdownstream targets Bim and p21. These results verified the significance ofmiR-20a-5p and explored its functional mechanisms in TNBC, suggesting thepotential clinical applications of miR-20a-5p in TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018.
