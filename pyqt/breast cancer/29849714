This study systematically reviewed theclinical effect and safety of traditional Chinese medicine Kangai injection as anadjuvant method in combination with chemotherapy for treating Chinese patientswith breast cancer.Methods: Seven databases were searched in this study, namely, PubMed, theCochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, Sino Med, VIP, and Wanfang Data. The timeframe ofretrieval was set from the founding date of each database to November 1, 2017.Results: Fifteen papers were included in this study. The quality of all thestudies included was low. All the studies were carried out among the Chinesepopulation. Meta-analyses showed that, compared with single-use chemotherapy,using a Kangai injection combined with chemotherapy to treat Chinese breastcancer patient can increase the total effective rate [RR = 1.15, 95% CI (1.01,1.32), and P = 0.033], improve the quality of life [RR = 1.30, 95% CI (1.14,1.48), and P ≤ 0.001], decrease the incidence of weight loss [RR = 0.49, 95% CI(0.32, 0.77), and P = 0.002], decrease WBC count [RR = 0.78, 95% CI (0.68, 0.89),and P ≤ 0.001], decrease incidence of renal and liver dysfunction [RR = 0.58, 95%CI (0.46, 0.73), and P ≤ 0.001], and decrease cardiac dysfunction [RR = 0.41, 95%CI (0.18, 0.94), and P = 0.035]. For the incidence of gastrointestinal adversereactions [RR = 0.89, 95% CI (0.65, 1.21), and P = 0.452], decreased plateletcount [RR=0.49, 95% CI (0.18, 1.30), and P = 0.150], and alopecia [RR = 1.01, 95%CI (0.89, 1.14), and P = 0.879], these two groups showed no statisticallysignificant differences.Conclusion: Kangai injection as an adjuvant method in combination withchemotherapy for treating Chinese breast cancer patients can improve their lifequality and physical conditions and reduce the adverse reactions that result fromchemotherapy. However, the present conclusion is only suitable for the Chinesepopulation. The long-term, high-quality researches are required to further verifythe above conclusions.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6305645 PMCID: PMC5932437PMID: 29849714
