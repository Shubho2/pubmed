In this study, the transketolase(TKT) expression correlated with tumor size in the 4T1/BALB/c syngeneic model. Inaddition, TKT expression was higher in lymph node metastases compared withprimary tumor or normal tissues of patients, and high TKT levels were associated with poor survival. Depletion of TKT or addition of alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG)enhanced the levels of tumor suppressors succinate dehydrogenase and fumaratehydratase (FH), decreasing oncometabolites succinate and fumarate, and furtherstabilizing HIF prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) and decreasing HIF1α, ultimatelysuppressing breast cancer metastasis. Reduced TKT or addition of αKG mediated adynamic switch of glucose metabolism from glycolysis to oxidativephosphorylation. Various combinations of the TKT inhibitor oxythiamine,docetaxel, and doxorubicin enhanced cell death in triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC) cells. Furthermore, oxythiamine treatment led to increased levels of αKGin TNBC cells. Together, our study has identified a novel TKT-mediated αKGsignaling pathway that regulates breast cancer oncogenesis and can be exploitedas a modality for improving therapy.Significance: These findings uncover theclinical significance of TKT in breast cancer progression and metastasis anddemonstrate effective therapy by inhibiting TKT or by adding αKG.
