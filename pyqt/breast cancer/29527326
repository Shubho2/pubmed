This work investigatescarbon-based nanoparticles as potential contrast agents for terahertz imaging of breast cancer. Microdiamonds, nanodiamonds, and nanometer-scale onion-like carbonare characterized with terahertz transmission spectroscopy in low-absorptionbackgrounds of polydimethylsiloxane or polyethylene. The refractive index andabsorption coefficients are calculated based on the measured electric fields.Nanodiamonds show little effect on the terahertz signal, microdiamonds expressresonance-like, size-dependent absorption peaks, and onion-like carbon provides auniform increase in the optical properties even at low concentration. Due to its strong interaction with terahertz frequencies and ability to be activated forselective binding to cancer cells, onion-like carbon is implemented intoengineered three-dimensional breast tumor models composed of phantom tissuemimicking infiltrating ductal carcinoma surrounded by a phantom mimicking healthyfibroglandular tissue. This model is imaged using the terahertz reflection modeto examine the effectiveness of contrast agents for differentiation between thetwo tissue types. In both spectroscopy and imaging, a 10% concentration ofonion-like carbon shows the strongest impact on the terahertz signal and holdspromise as a terahertz contrast agent.DOI: 10.1088/2057-1976/aa87c2 PMCID: PMC5839518 [Available on 2018-10-01]PMID: 29527326
