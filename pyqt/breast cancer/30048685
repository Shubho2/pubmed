However, the transcriptionalrole of SRC-2 in breast cancer is still ambiguous. Here we aimed to unravel amore precise transcriptional role of SRC-2 and uncover unique target genes inMCF-7 breast cancer cells, as opposed to the known oncogene SRC-3. Geneexpression analyses of cells depleted of either SRC-2 or SRC-3 showed that theytranscriptionally regulate mostly separate gene sets. However, individual unique gene sets were implicated in some of the same major gene ontology biologicalprocesses, such as cellular structure and development. This finding was supportedby three-dimensional cell cultures, demonstrating that depletion of SRC-2 andSRC-3 changed the morphology of the cells into epithelial-like hollow acinarstructures, indicating that both SRC proteins are involved in maintaining thehybrid E/M phenotype. In clinical ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancersamples the expression of SRC-2 was negatively correlated with the expression of MCF-7-related luminal, cell cycle and cellular morphogenesis genes. Finally,elucidating SRC-2 unique transcriptional effects, we identified Lyn kinase (anEMT biomarker) to be upregulated exclusively after SRC-2 depletion. Inconclusion, we show that both SRC-2 and SRC-3 are essential for the EMT in breastcancer cells, controlling different transcriptional niches.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
