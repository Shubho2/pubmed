First, 210 patients with new incidence of breast cancer were identified.Mammograms from these patients prior to developing breast cancer were identified and made up the case group [420 bilateral craniocaudal mammograms]. The controlgroup consisted of 527 patients without breast cancer from the same time period. Prior mammograms from these patients made up the control group [1054 bilateralcraniocaudal mammograms]. A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture wasdesigned for pixel-wise breast cancer risk prediction. Briefly, each mammogramwas normalized as a map of z-scores and resized to an input image size of256 × 256. Then a contracting and expanding fully convolutional CNN architecture was composed entirely of 3 × 3 convolutions, a total of four strided convolutionsinstead of pooling layers, and symmetric residual connections. L2 regularization and augmentation methods were implemented to prevent overfitting. Cases wereseparated into training (80%) and test sets (20%). A 5-fold cross validation was performed. Software code was written in Python using the TensorFlow module on aLinux workstation with NVIDIA GTX 1070 Pascal GPU.RESULTS: The average age of patients between the case and the control groups was not statistically different [case: 57.4 years (SD, 10.4) and control: 58.2 years (SD, 10.9), p = 0.33]. Breast Density (BD) was significantly higher in the casegroup [2.39 (SD, 0.7)] than the control group [1.98 (SD, 0.75), p < 0.0001]. Onmultivariate logistic regression analysis, both CNN pixel-wise mammographic risk model and BD were significant independent predictors of breast cancer risk (p <0.0001). The CNN risk model showed greater predictive potential [OR = 4.42 (95%CI, 3.4-5.7] compared to BD [OR = 1.67 (95% CI, 1.4-1.9). The CNN risk modelachieved an overall accuracy of 72% (95%CI, 69.8-74.4) in predicting patients in the case group.CONCLUSION: Novel pixel-wise mammographic breast evaluation using a CNNarchitecture can stratify breast cancer risk, independent of the BD. Largerdataset will likely improve our model.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.acra.2018.06.020 PMID: 30072292
