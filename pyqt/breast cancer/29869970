Materials andMethods Preclinical studies in nine 786-0-R renal cell carcinoma (RCC) xenograftsand prospective clinical studies in eight patients with RCC were performed.Longitudinal relaxation rate changes (∆R1) after 100% oxygen inhalation werequantified, reflecting the paramagnetic effect on tissue protons because of thepresence of molecular oxygen. Native transverse relaxation rate (R2*) andoxygen-induced R2* change (∆R2*) were measured, reflecting presence ofdeoxygenated hemoglobin molecules. Median and voxel-wise values of ∆R1 werecompared with values of R2* and ∆R2*. Tumor regions with dynamic contrastagent-enhanced MRI perfusion, refractory to signal change at OE MRI (referred to as perfused Oxy-R), were distinguished from perfused oxygen-enhancing (perfusedOxy-E) and nonperfused regions. R2* and ∆R2* values in each tumor subregion were compared by using one-way analysis of variance. Results Tumor-wise and voxel-wise∆R1 and ∆R2* comparisons did not show correlative relationships. In xenografts,parcellation analysis revealed that perfused Oxy-R regions had faster native R2* (102.4 sec-1 vs 81.7 sec-1) and greater negative ∆R2* (-22.9 sec-1 vs -5.4sec-1), compared with perfused Oxy-E and nonperfused subregions (all P < .001),respectively. Similar findings were present in human tumors (P < .001). Further, perfused Oxy-R helped identify tumor hypoxia, measured at pathologic analysis, inboth xenografts (P = .002) and human tumors (P = .003). Conclusion Intrinsicsusceptibility biomarkers provide cross validation of the OE MRI biomarkerperfused Oxy-R. Consistent relationship to pathologic analyses was found inxenografts and human tumors, demonstrating biomarker translation. © RSNA, 2018Online supplemental material is available for this article.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018171531 PMID: 29869970
