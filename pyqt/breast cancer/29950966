In sub-Saharan Africa, most breastcancer patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. Some studies have quantifiedthe time delay to diagnosis in sub-Saharan Africa, but very few have usedqualitative methods to understand barriers leading to delay. This study analyses barriers throughout a breast cancer patient's pathway from symptom recognition totreatment in Mali.Method: Three focus group discussions were conducted. The model of pathways totreatment was used to structure the results into 4 time intervals: appraisal,help-seeking, diagnosis, and treatment, with a focus on barriers during eachinterval.Results: The main barriers during the appraisal interval were a low level ofbreast cancer knowledge among women, their families, and medical professionals,and during the help-seeking interval, mistrust in the community health carecenters and economic hardship. Barriers during the diagnosis interval were lowquality of health care services and lack of social support, and during thepretreatment interval high costs and lack of specialized services.Conclusion: Multilevel interventions are needed to ensure access, availability,and affordability of a minimum standard of care for breast cancer patients insub-Saharan Africa.DOI: 10.1159/000481087 PMCID: PMC6016059 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29950966
