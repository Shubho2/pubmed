China.The present study aimed to explore the relationship between DNA methylation andbreast cancer under different cell culture conditions. MCF‑7 breast cancer cells were cultured in two‑dimensional (2D), three‑dimensional (3D) and orthotopictransplantation (Ti) adhesion substrates. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for global visualization of these three samples. The methylation status ofCpG sites was examined by unsupervised clustering analysis. Scatter plots andhistograms were constructed from the mean β‑values from 3D vs. 2D, 3D vs. Ti and Ti vs. 2D analysis. In addition, analyses of Gene Ontology (GO) terms and KyotoEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were conducted to explore theputative biological functions in which mutL homolog (MLH), phosphatase and tensinhomolog (PTEN), runt‑related transcription factor (RUNX), Ras association domain family (RASSF), cadherin 1 (CDH1), O‑6‑methylguanine‑DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)and P16 may serve a role. Quantitative methylation‑specific polymerase chainreaction (QMSP) was performed to determine the influence of culturing conditions on important gene expression. Results from PCA analysis indicated that the three samples were closely connected with each other. Venn diagrams revealed thatcertain differential methylation positions were common among the three samplegroups, and 116 CpG positions were identified that appeared to behypermethylated. The methylation patterns were more similar between 3D vs. 2Dcultures compared with those between 3D vs. Ti or between Ti vs. 2D. Results ofGO term and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that genes were enriched in fourpathways, including transporter activity and G‑protein coupled receptor activity.In addition, QMSP analysis identified no notable differences in the methylationstatus of MLH, PTEN, RUNX, RASSF, CDH1, MGMT and P16 under 2D, 3D and Ti culture conditions. In conclusion, abnormal DNA methylation is related with breastcancer, and the methylation status did not change in breast cancer cells culturedin different conditions.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8735 PMID: 29568926
