Electronic address: atheoch@upatras.gr.Serglycin is an intracellular proteoglycan that is expressed and constitutivelysecreted by numerous malignant cells, especially prominent in thehighly-invasive, triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. Notably, denovo expression of serglycin in low aggressive estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positiveMCF7 breast cancer cells promotes an aggressive phenotype. In this study, wediscovered that serglycin promoted epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MCF7 cells as shown by increased expression of mesenchymal markers vimentin,fibronectin and EMT-related transcription factor Snail2. These phenotypic traits were also associated with the development of drug resistance toward variouschemotherapy agents and induction of their proteolytic potential as shown by the increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases, including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9,MT1-MMP and up-regulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Knockdown ofserglycin markedly reduced the expression of these proteolytic enzymes inMDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, serglycin expression was closely linked to apro-inflammatory gene signature including the chemokine IL-8 in ERα-negativebreast cancer cells and tumors. Notably, serglycin regulated the secretion ofIL-8 in breast cancer cells independently of their ERα status and promoted their proliferation, migration and invasion by triggering IL-8/CXCR2 downstreamsignaling cascades including PI3K, Src and Rac activation. Thus, serglycinpromotes the establishment of a pro-inflammatory milieu in breast cancer cellsthat evokes an invasive mesenchymal phenotype via autocrine activation ofIL-8/CXCR2 signaling axis.Copyright © 2017 International Society of Matrix Biology.
