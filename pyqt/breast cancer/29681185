There is growing evidence of how compassion trainingenhances psychological and physical well-being, however, there are very fewstudies analyzing the efficacy of compassion-based Interventions on BC survivors.OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of the Cognitively-Based Compassion Training(CBCT) protocol in a BC survivor sample on quality of life, psychologicalwell-being, fear of cancer recurrence, self-compassion, and compassion domainsand mindfulness facets. Furthermore, enrollment, adherence, and satisfaction withthe intervention were also analyzed.METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was designed. Participants (n = 56) wererandomly assigned to CBCT (n = 28) or a treatment-as-usual control group (TAU; n = 28). Pre-post intervention and 6-month follow-up measures took place toevaluate health-related quality of life, psychological well-being; psychological stress, coping strategies, and triggering cognitions; self-compassion andcompassion; and mindfulness in both intervention and wait-list groups.RESULTS: Accrual of eligible participants was high (77%), and the drop-out ratewas 16%. Attendance to CBCT sessions was high and practice off sessions exceeded expectations). CBCT was effective in diminishing stress caused by FCR, fostering self-kindness and common humanity, and increasing overall self-compassion scores,mindful observation, and acting with awareness skillsets.CONCLUSION: CBCT could be considered a promising and potentially usefulintervention to diminish stress caused by FCR and enhance self-kindness, commonhumanity, overall self-compassion, mindful observation, and acting with awarenessskillsets. Nevertheless, future randomized trials are needed and a process ofdeeper cultural adaptation required.DOI: 10.1177/1534735418772095 PMID: 29681185
