To capture informative prognostic data connected to pathologicalresponse in such trials, it is critical to standardize pathologic assessment and reporting of tumor response after this treatment.Methods: The International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium meetings in 2016 and2017 assembled pathologists from academic centers to develop consensus guidelinesfor pathologic examination and reporting of surgical specimens from AJCC (8thEdition) stage IIIB/C/D or oligometastatic stage IV melanoma patients treatedwith neoadjuvant targeted or immune therapy. Patterns of pathologic responseprovided context to inform these guidelines.Results: Based on our collective experience and guided by efforts inwell-established neoadjuvant settings like breast cancer, procedures directinghandling of pre- and post-neoadjuvant therapy treated melanoma specimens areprovided to facilitate comparison of findings across different trials andcenters. Definitions of pathologic response are provided together with guidelinesfor reporting and quantifying the extent of pathologic response. Finally, thespectrum of histopathologic responses observed following neoadjuvant targeted andimmune checkpoint therapy is described and illustrated.Conclusions: Standardizing pathologic evaluation of resected melanoma metastases following neoadjuvant targeted or immune-checkpoint therapy allows more robuststratification of patient outcomes. This includes recognizing the spectrum ofhistopathologic response patterns to neoadjuvant therapy and a standard approach to grading pathologic responses. Such an approach will facilitate comparison ofresults across clinical trials and inform ongoing correlative studies into themechanisms of response and resistance to agents applied in the neoadjuvantsetting.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy226 PMID: 29945191
