The pigment was extracted with chloroform, purified bypreparative TLC and characterized by Fourier transmittance infrared, electronspray ionization mass spectroscopy, liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy andnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (1 HNMR, 13 C NMR) spectral analysis, whichrevealed the pigment to be 'long chain hydrocarbons with poly unsaturated groups'(m/z 702). Pigment stability varied with different pH, temperature and sunlightconditions. The pigment-induced cell death in human breast adenocarcinoma cellsMCF-7 and showed no significant toxicity in CHOK 1 cells. Lipid peroxidationassay revealed that treatment with pigment was able to reduce the lipidperoxidation caused by H2 O2 in MCF-7 cells.CONCLUSIONS: The F. chlamydosporum pigment is a compound of long-chainhydrocarbons with poly unsaturated groups, possessing selective cytotoxicity inMCF-7 cancer cell lines.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The pigment can be used as a colouringagent in cosmetics. Its anticancer potential can be used in production oftherapeutics in increasing demand cancer research.Â© 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology.DOI: 10.1111/jam.13756 PMID: 29527765
