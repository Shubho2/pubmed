The aim of our study was to analyse theinfluence of bone mineral density, fractures and bisphosphonate or vitamin Dprescription on 10 years' breast cancer outcome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a longitudinal and prospective cohort of 450postmenopausal women with local oestrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer. For everypatient, we analysed tumour characteristics, bone status at the beginning ofaromatase inhibitor treatment and 10 years' cancer outcome with Cox model.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 10.3 ± 3.0 years. Seventy nine women died, and 75 hada relapse; 30.7% had a history of fracture, 16.9% had a T-score ≤ -2.5 and 11.3% had vitamin D deficiency. Bisphosphonates were prescribed to 35.3% women forosteoporosis for a mean duration of 5 ± 1.7 years. Tumour size (hazard ratio[HR] = 1.32, P ≤ 0.01) and the number of lymph nodes involved (HR = 1.07,P = 0.03) were significantly associated with relapse. Bisphosphonate treatmentwas significantly associated with a decreased risk of relapse (HR = 0.51,P = 0.03). Age at cancer diagnosis (HR = 1.07, P ≤ 0.01) and vitamin D deficiency(HR = 1.85, P = 0.04) were significantly associated with an increased risk ofdeath, whereas bisphosphonate treatment was associated with a decreased risk ofdeath (HR = 0.46, P = 0.01).CONCLUSION: Osteoporosis treatment, including vitamin D and bisphosphonates, isassociated with a 50% reduction of relapse and death in women treated witharomatase inhibitors for ER+ breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
