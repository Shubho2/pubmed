Epub 2018 Apr 25.Cancer risk associated with living at high altitude in Ecuadorian population from2005 to 2014.Garrido DI(1), Garrido SM(1).Author information: (1)Rural Medicine Service, Ministry of Public Health, Ecuador.Background and aims: Cancer is a leading cause of death in Ecuador with highsocial and economic impact. This study aims to determinate the influence ofliving at a high altitude on the risk of developing or dying from cancer amongthe Ecuadorian population.Methods: This is an ecological and epidemiological analysis of cancer mortalityand prevalence rates, based on national data from the Ecuadorian NationalStatistics and Census Institute, corresponding to the period between 2005 and2014. This study includes the analysis of various types of cancer: gastric,colorectal, hepatic/bile duct, breast, uterine/cervix, andlymphatic/hematopoietic, using rates of mortality and prevalence. Additionally,the association between the risk of getting or dying from cancer and living athigh altitude was investigated. This comparison was made between the populationliving in Highlands, over 2000 meters above sea level, and low-lying regions.Results: Living at high altitude was associated with a higher prevalence ofcancer and also with a high mortality rate due to cancer. Risk of getting cancer was related to living at a higher altitude, as well as an increased risk of deathby cancer: gastric (OR:1.204; p<0.001), colorectal (OR:1.421; p<0.001),hepatic/bile duct (OR:1.184; p<0.001), breast (OR:1.067; p=0.030), orlymphatic/hematopoietic neoplasms (OR:1.135; p<0.001).Conclusions: Through an epidemiologic analysis, the association betweendeveloping or dying from cancer and living at high altitude was obtained.However, further researche is needed to clarify these findings, something thatcould have a substantial impact on cancer prevention.DOI: 10.15386/cjmed-932 PMCID: PMC5958984PMID: 29785157
