Electronic address: lqchang@mdanderson.org.(2)Department of Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson CancerCenter, Houston, Texas.PURPOSE: To study the impact of second-opinion interpretation of breast imagingstudies submitted from outside facilities to a tertiary cancer center.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective database review was conducted ofsecond-opinion interpretations rendered at our institution from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2014, on studies from patients who did not have a concurrent breastcancer diagnosis. A total of 2,253 patients were included.RESULTS: In 800 of 2,253 patients (35.5%), the BI-RADS categories assigned at ourinstitution and at outside facilities were discordant. Of 973 patients assignedBI-RADS category 4 or 5 at outside facilities, 278 (28.6%) were assigned BI-RADS category 1 to 3 (no biopsy necessary) at our institution. Of 923 patientsassigned BI-RADS category 1 to 3 at outside facilities, 191 (20.7%) were assignedBI-RADS category 4 or 5 at our institution, and 189 of these had biopsies, which revealed 23 cancers, 15 high-risk lesions, and 151 benign lesions. One high-risk lesion at core biopsy was upgraded to invasive ductal carcinoma and ductalcarcinoma in situ (DCIS) on excision, resulting in 24 cancers. Of these, 18reflected true additional breast cancers detected as a result of second-opinioninterpretation: 12 invasive carcinomas and 6 cases of DCIS. These resultstranslate into a 9.4% (18/191) positive predictive value for the number ofcancers diagnosed among all biopsies recommended and a 9.5% (18/189) positivepredictive value for the number of cancers diagnosed among all biopsiesrecommended and actually performed.CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the positive clinical impact ofsecond-opinion interpretation at a tertiary cancer center of outside-facilitybreast imaging studies in patients without a breast cancer diagnosis.Copyright © 2018 American College of Radiology.
