Antiproliferativeactivity of the newly synthesized compounds, as well as previously synthesized3-oxo-16,17-secoandrosta-1,4-diene-16,17a-dinitrile (VII), was tested in vitro.Compound 9 displayed submicromolar antiproliferative activity against humancervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells (IC50 0.48 μM), and compounds 3 and 10 expressed strong inhibitory potential against HeLa cells (IC50 4.31 μM and 2.64 μM,respectively). Also, compound 10 was effective in inhibiting estrogenhormone-independent (MDA-MB-231) cells (IC50 2.78 μM). All tested compounds hadno influence on the proliferation of healthy cells (MRC-5). Since MDA-MB-231breast cancer cells and HeLa cervical cancer cells were most sensitive totreatment by 16,17-seco-16,17a-dinitriles, apoptosis induction after treatment bycompounds 3, VII, 9 and 10 was studied in these cells, to reveal the mechanismunderlying cell growth inhibition. All tested compounds significantly inducedapoptosis in both treated cell lines, which was evident from results obtained by a double AO-EB staining test and quantified by counting cells with apoptoticmorphology after staining with Giemsa dye. Among all tested substances,(6E)-hydroxyimino-4-en-3-one derivative 10 expressed the most proapoptoticactivity.Copyright © 2018.
