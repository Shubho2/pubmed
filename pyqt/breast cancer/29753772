[Epub ahead of print]Increase in hyaluronic acid degradation decreases the expression of estrogenreceptor alpha in MCF7 breast cancer cell line.Hanoux V(1), Eguida J(2), Fleurot E(2), Levallet J(2), Bonnamy PJ(2).Author information: (1)Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, OeReCa, 14000 Caen, France. Electronic address:vincent.hanoux@unicaen.fr.(2)Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, OeReCa, 14000 Caen, France.The loss of estrogen receptor α (ERα) expression in breast cancer constitutes amajor hallmark of tumor progression to metastasis and is generally correlated to a strong increase in Hyaluronic Acid (HA) turnover. The aim of our study was tosearch for a putative link between these two major events of breast cancerprogression in the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) MCF7 breast cancer cell line.The increase in HA turnover was performed by stable overexpression of thestandard CD44 (CD44S) isoform and also by treatment with exogenous Hyaluronidase (Hyal) to allow an increase in HA catabolism. Stable overexpression of CD44S inMCF7 cells was correlated to a decrease in ESR1 gene expression, which did notlead to alteration of estrogen response. Moreover, our results showed that theexposure to exogenous Hyal stimulates the proliferation and strongly decreasesthe expression of ERα whatever the expression level of CD44 in the MCF7 cellline. The culture in the presence of Hyal led to the decrease in estrogensresponsiveness and to hormonal therapy resistance. The effect on growth iscorrelated to the activation of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways whilethe Hyal-induced down-regulation of ESR1 gene expression involves the activation of PI3K/Akt and NF-κB signaling pathways. Many of our data suggest that theeffects of Hyal described here could be related to the activation of TLRsignaling. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the increase in HAdegradation could be involved in breast cancer progression and in resistance tohormonal therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
