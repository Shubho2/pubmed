India.Series of novel truncated carbocyclic nucleoside analogues have been synthesized from the versatile starting material D-ribose and their anticancer activitieshave been evaluated. The nucleoside analogues induced cytotoxicity in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. These compounds are less cytotoxic to normal kidneycell line (HEK 293) as compared to the cancer cells. Among the synthesizedcompounds, 1b and 1d showed the better cytotoxic effect with IC50 44 and 54 μM,in MCF7 cells, respectively. These compounds inactivate the important signalingkinases AKT and mTOR and thereby induce autophagy. Collectively our observationsuggests that compound 1b and 1d inhibit the cancer cell proliferation throughinduction of autophagy mode of cell death.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180322120533 PMID: 29577866
