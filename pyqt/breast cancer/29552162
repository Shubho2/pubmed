Epub 2018 Feb 2.Effects of 5-hydroxy-4'-nitro-7-propionyloxy-genistein on inhibitingproliferation and invasion via activating reactive oxygen species in humanovarian cancer A2780/DDP cells.Bai J(1), Yang BJ(1), Luo X(1).Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Clinical School of JinanUniversity, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510632, P.R. China.5-hydroxy-4'-nitro-7-propionyloxy-genistein (HNPG), a novel synthetic isoflavone derivative, was demonstrated to possess antitumor activity in gastric cancer and breast cancer in vitro, but its antitumor effect and mechanism in ovarian cancer has not been characterized. The aim of the present study was to investigate theeffects of HNPG on inhibiting the proliferation and invasion in human ovariancancer A2780 cell lines of cisplatin resistance (A2780/DDP) and elucidate itsunderlying molecular mechanism. The results indicated that HNPG presented withmarked antitumor activity against A2780/DDP cells in vitro, significantlyinhibited the rates of proliferation, clone formation, invasion and metastasis,and markedly induced apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manner.Simultaneously, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased andmitochondrial membrane potential was decreased. In addition, Bcl-2 expression wasdownregulated, Bax expression was upregulated, and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax wasdecreased. Concurrently, levels of Cyt-C were markedly enhanced and the caspasecascade was triggered. Taken together, the results suggested that HNPG exertedanticancer effects through promoting ROS accumulation in cells, triggeringmitochondrial apoptotic pathways and ultimately resulting in cells apoptosis.Therefore, HNPG serves as a potential candidate in the chemoprevention and/ortreatment of cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7938 PMCID: PMC5840745PMID: 29552162
