Epub 2017 Dec 20.A False Positive I-131 Metastatic Survey Caused by Radioactive Iodine Uptake by aBenign Thymic Cyst.Singh AK(1), Bodolan AA(2), Gilbert MP(3).Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, The Robert Larner, M.D. College of Medicine at TheUniversity of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA.(2)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Robert Larner, M.D.College of Medicine at The University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA.(3)Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, The Robert Larner, M.D. College ofMedicine at The University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, USA.Thyroid carcinoma is the most common endocrine malignancy in the United Stateswith increasing incidence and diagnosis but stable mortality. Differentiatedthyroid cancer rarely presents with distant metastases and is associated with alow risk of morbidity and mortality. Despite this, current protocols recommendremnant ablation with radioactive iodine and evaluation for local and distantmetastasis in some patients with higher risk disease. There are several casereports of false positive results of metastatic surveys that are either normalphysiologic variants or other pathological findings. Most false positive findingsare associated with tissue that has physiologic increased uptake of I-131, suchas breast tissue or lung tissue; pathological findings such as thymic cysts arealso known to have increased uptake. Our case describes a rare finding of athymic cyst found on a false positive I-131 metastatic survey. The patient wastaken for surgical excision and the final pathology was a benign thymic cyst.Given that pulmonary metastases of differentiated thyroid cancer are rare, thymiccysts, though also rare, must be part of the differential diagnosis for falsepositive findings on an I-131 survey.DOI: 10.1155/2017/6469015 PMCID: PMC5750482PMID: 29423324
