Here,tumor-pH-sensitive polymeric microspheres, which are prepared by multiblockpoly(l-lactide) with pH-sensitive acetal bonds in the backbone, are employed toefficiently load water-soluble anticancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride(DOX·HCl, drug loading content: ∼10%). The pH-sensitive DOX-loaded hollowmicrospheres were in the size range 2-10 μm and exhibited acid-accelerateddegradation of polymer matrix and drug release, and thereby efficient in vitrocancer cell inhibition. The microspheres were further intratumorally injectedinto breast-tumor-bearing mice, and the in vivo anticancer experiment showed thatpH-sensitive DOX-loaded microsphere showed better antitumor efficiency andprolonged life-span than its counterpart that does not have pH-responsiveproperty. Moreover, negligible organ toxicity, especially cardiotoxicity thatgenerally exists in DOX-involved chemotherapy where DOX is administrated byintravenous injection, was observed for DOX-loaded microspheres. Hence,tumor-pH-sensitive polymeric microspheres have appeared to be a simple andefficient platform for delivering hydrophilic anticancer drug with excellentanticancer efficacy and low systemic toxicity.DOI: 10.1021/acs.biomac.8b00734 PMID: 29883542
