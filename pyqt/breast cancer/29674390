This prospective study investigates the association between dietarysugars (fructose and sucrose) and sugary foods and beverages in relation tocombined and site-specific (breast, prostate, colorectal) adiposity-associatedcancers.Methods: The analytic sample consisted of 3,184 adults, aged 26-84 years,from the Framingham Offspring cohort. Diet data were first collected between 1991and 1995 using a food frequency questionnaire. Intakes of fructose, sucrose,sugary foods, and sugary beverages (fruit juice and sugar-sweetened beverages)were derived. Participants were followed up until 2013 to ascertain cancerincidence; 565 doctor-diagnosed adiposity-related cancers, including 124 breast, 157 prostate, and 68 colorectal cancers occurred. Multivariable-adjusted Coxproportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations. Tests forinteraction with BMI and waist circumference were conducted.Results: Noassociations were observed between fructose, sucrose, sugary food consumption,and combined incidence of adiposity-related cancers or the examined site-specificcancers. While total consumption of sugary beverages was not associated withsite-specific cancer risk, higher intakes of fruit juice were associated with 58%increased prostate cancer risk (HR: 1.58; 95% CI, 1.04-2.41) inmultivariable-adjusted models. In exploratory stratified analyses, higher sugary beverage intakes increased overall adiposity-related cancer risk by 59% inparticipants with excessive central adiposity (HR: 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.50;Ptrend = 0.057).Conclusions: In this cohort of American adults, higher sugarybeverage consumption was associated with increased cancer risk among participantswith central adiposity.Impact: These analyses suggest that avoiding sugarybeverages represents a simple dietary modification that may be used as aneffective cancer control strategy.
