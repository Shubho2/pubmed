[Epub ahead of print]Differential expression and molecular interactions of chromosome regionmaintenance 1 and calreticulin exportins in breast cancer cells.Cruz-Ramos E(1), Sandoval-Hernández A(1), Tecalco-Cruz AC(2).Author information: (1)Programa de Investigación de Cáncer de Mama, Instituto de InvestigacionesBiomédicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Apdo Postal, México D.F.04510, Mexico.(2)Programa de Investigación de Cáncer de Mama, Instituto de InvestigacionesBiomédicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Apdo Postal, México D.F.04510, Mexico. Electronic address: atecalco@iibiomedicas.unam.mx.Chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM-1) and calreticulin (CALR) are two proteins that act as exportins for some nuclear receptors, in addition to other criticalfunctions for cellular homeostasis. In several cancer types, CRM-1 and CALR areupregulated suggesting an imbalance in their functions. However, the regulationof CRM-1 and CALR, and their biological implications, are not completely known.Here, we evaluated the interplay between the levels of CRM-1 and CALR, andestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) status, in breast cancer cells. CRM-1 and CALR wereupregulated in mammary tumors relative to normal mammary tissue. Furthermore, themRNA and protein levels of CRM-1 and CALR were higher in breast cancer cellslacking ERα, in comparison with those that express ERα. Additionally, bothproteins were distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm in the two cell types.Importantly, we identified novel interactions for these exportins. First, weshowed an interaction between CRM-1 and CALR, and then we identified that SUN1and SUN2, two proteins localized in the nuclear envelop, were able to interactspecifically with CRM-1, but not CALR. Interestingly, SUN1 and SUN2 expressionseemed to be decreased in breast cancer, thereby affecting the interactions ofthese proteins with CRM-1, and possibly its actions as an exportin. Thus, ourdata suggest that expression levels for CRM-1 and CALR, the interaction betweenthese exportins, and specific interactions of SUN1 and SUN2 with CRM-1 but notCALR, may be central elements in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Furthermore,deregulation of these elements may have serious implications in the progressionof breast and other types of cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
