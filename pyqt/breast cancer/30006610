Here, weexamined the role of CTSS in regulating the DNA damage response in breast cancer cells. Activating CTSS (producing the cleavage form of the protein) by radiation induced proteolytic degradation of BRCA1, which ultimately suppressed DNAdouble-strand break repair activity. Depletion of CTSS by RNAi or expression of amutant type of CTSS enhanced the protein stability of BRCA1 by inhibiting itsubiquitination. CTSS interacted with the BRCT domain of BRCA1 and facilitatedubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation of BRCA1, which was tightly associatedwith decreased BRCA1-mediated DNA repair activity. Treatment with apharmacological CTSS inhibitor inhibited proteolytic degradation of BRCA1 andrestored BRCA1 function. Depletion of CTSS by shRNA delayed tumor growth in axenograft mouse model, only in the presence of functional BRCA1. Spontaneouslyuced rat mammary tumors and human breast cancer tissues with high levels of CTSS expression showed low BRCA1 expression. From these data, we suggest that CTSSinhibition is a good strategy for functional restoration of BRCA1 in breastcancers with reduced BRCA1 protein stability.DOI: 10.1038/s41418-018-0153-0 PMID: 30006610
