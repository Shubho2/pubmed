China.Breast cancer is known as the most prevalent cancer in women worldwide, and hasan undeniable negative impact on public health, both physically, and mentally.This study aims to investigate the effects of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) genesilencing on proliferation and apoptosis of human breast cancer cells to explore for a new theoretical basis for its treatment. TLR4 small interference RNA(siRNA) fragment recombinant plasmids were constructed, including TLR4 siRNA-1,TLR4 siRNA-2, and TLR4 siRNA-3. Human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cellswere assigned into blank, negative control (NC), TLR4 siRNA-1, TLR4 siRNA-2, and TLR4 siRNA-3 groups. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth was detected by MTT assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry. Reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis wereconducted to determine the expression of TLR4, CDK4, cyclin D1, Livin, Bcl-2,p53, c-FLIP, and caspase-3. In comparison with the NC and blank groups, the TLR4 siRNA-1, TLR4 siRNA-2, and TLR4 siRNA-3 groups showed decreased the expression ofTLR4, inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and promoted MCF-7and MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis, and the cells were blocked in G1 phase. Incomparison with the NC and blank groups, in the TLR4 siRNA-1, TLR4 siRNA-2, andTLR4 siRNA-3 groups, siRNA-TLR4 significantly increased expression of p53 andcaspase-3 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, while it decreased the expressions ofCDK4, cyclinD1, Livin, Bal-2, and c-FLIP. The study demonstrates that TLR4 genesilencing inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26573 PMID: 29932226
