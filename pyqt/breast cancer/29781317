Multiple drugs havebeen developed and are currently in clinical use, including trastuzumab,lapatinib, pertuzumab, T-DM1, and neratinib, alone or combined in 'dualHER2-blockade' regimens. Areas covered: A comprehensive literature review wasperformed regarding the current state and the future of combination regimenscontaining anti-HER2 agents, focusing on their efficacy, toxicity, andcost-effectiveness. Expert commentary: The combination of trastuzumab/pertuzumab is approved in all disease settings, while trastuzumab/neratinib is approved inthe adjuvant setting and trastuzumab/lapatinib in metastatic disease. Meanwhile, as breast cancer biology and resistance mechanisms become clearer, combinationswith drugs like PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, anti-PD(L)1antibodies, endocrine therapy, and new anti-HER2 agents (panHER and HER2 tyrosinekinase inhibitors, bispecific antibodies, anti-HER3 antibodies, and antibody-drugconjugates) are being extensively tested in clinical trials. More specificstrategies for the 'triple-positive' (estrogen receptor-positive/HER2-positive)disease are also being explored. However, there is an urgent need for thedevelopment of predictive biomarkers for a better tailoring of anti-HER2 directedtherapy. This is the only way to further improve clinical outcomes and quality oflife and to decrease costs and toxicities of unnecessary treatments.DOI: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1477596 PMID: 29781317
