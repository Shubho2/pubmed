Evidence shows that, after mastectomy, women in Vietnam have alower quality of life than women in other countries. In addition, highuncertainty is a predictor of low quality of life postmastectomy. Therefore, ifnurses can manage uncertainty, the quality of life postmastectomy can improve.OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effect of the Uncertainty Management Program(UMP) on quality of life at 3 weeks postmastectomy in Vietnamese women.METHODS: This research was a quasi-experimental study using a "posttest only withcontrol group" design. There were 115 subjects assigned to either theexperimental group (n = 57), who participated in the UMP and routine care, or thecontrol group (n = 58), who received only routine care. Participants wereassessed 2 times postmastectomy using the modified Quality of Life IndexScale-Vietnamese version.RESULTS: The experimental group exhibited low uncertainty before discharge andsignificantly higher quality of life than the control group at 1 and 3 weekspostmastectomy, respectively (P < .05). Women's physical well-being,psychological well-being, body image concerns, and social concerns weresignificantly increased with UMP.CONCLUSION: The UMP was considered as a promising program that might benefit the QoL of women with breast cancer 3 weeks postmastectomy.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The UMP appears feasible to apply for women withbreast cancer to improve their QoL postmastectomy in various settings. Nurses canflexibility instruct women in their holistic care attention both in the hospital and at home.DOI: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000597 PMID: 29746263
