[Epub ahead ofprint]Identification of miR-146a is Associated with the Aggressiveness and SuppressesProliferation via Targeting CDKN2A in Breast Cancer.Zhang Y(1), Ding S(2), Yang J(2), Chen X(2), Huang W(2).Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Medicine, Changde Vocational and Technical College,#4253 Renmin Road, Wuling District, Changde City, 415000, Hunan Province, China. ypzhcd@126.com.(2)Department of Clinical Medicine, Changde Vocational and Technical College,#4253 Renmin Road, Wuling District, Changde City, 415000, Hunan Province, China.There is emerging evidence that some microRNAs can promote or suppress severalhuman cancer development and progression. However, the profile and molecularmechanism of microRNAs for human breast cancer is poorly unknown. We usedbioinformatics approaches to find new candidate diagnostic and therapeutic miRNAsin human breast cancer via analysis of TCGA RNA sequencing data and publicly GEO microarray data, in order to provide theoretical basis for the futureinvestigations of breast cancer. Decreased expression miR-146a was identified as a key regulator of human breast cancer development and progression.Interestingly, we founded that miR-146a expression levels dependent on tumor sizeand pathological grading in breast cancer patients, but not associated with otherfactors including age, T classification. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showedthat patients with high miR-146a expression had a longer survival rate than thoselow miR-146a expressions. In vitro assays of over-expression miR-146a inducescell cycle arrest and inhibits MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. Furthermore,luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated that miR-146a directly combine the3-untranslated region of CDKN2A mRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrated miR-146aplay an important role in breast cancer development and progression.DOI: 10.1007/s12253-018-0430-8 PMID: 29915929
