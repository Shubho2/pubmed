Abnormal expression of microRNAs is thought to contribute to thedevelopment and progression of cancer. A history of benign breast disease (BBD)is associated with increased risk of subsequent breast cancer. However, nolarge-scale study has examined the association between microRNA expression in BBDtissue and risk of subsequent invasive breast cancer (IBC). We conducteddiscovery and validation case-control studies nested in a cohort of 15,395 women diagnosed with BBD in a large health plan between 1971 and 2006 and followed tomid-2015. Cases were women with BBD who developed subsequent IBC; controls werematched 1:1 to cases on age, age at diagnosis of BBD, and duration of planmembership. The discovery stage (316 case-control pairs) entailed use of theIllumina MicroRNA Expression Profiling Assay (in duplicate) to identify breastcancer-associated microRNAs. MicroRNAs identified at this stage were ranked bythe strength of the correlation between Illumina array and quantitative PCRresults for 15 case-control pairs. The top ranked 14 microRNAs entered thevalidation stage (165 case-control pairs) which was conducted using quantitative PCR (in triplicate). In both stages, linear regression was used to evaluate theassociation between the mean expression level of each microRNA (responsevariable) and case-control status (independent variable); paired t-tests werealso used in the validation stage. None of the 14 validation stage microRNAs was associated with breast cancer risk. The results of this study suggest thatmicroRNA expression in benign breast tissue does not influence the risk ofsubsequent IBC.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0191814 PMCID: PMC5809016PMID: 29432432  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
