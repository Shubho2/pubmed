[Epub ahead of print]Diagnosis of paraganglioma as a pancreatic mass: A case report.Nguyen E(1), Nakasaki M(1), Lee TK(1), Lu D(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California,Irvine, California.Paragangliomas are rare neoplasms that arise from the chromaffin cells of theautonomic nervous system. Although paragangliomas can occur anywhere paraganglia are present, they tend to occur in the head, neck, and retroperitoneum. Rarely,paragangliomas can occur in the peripancreatic area and present as a pancreaticmass, creating a diagnostic challenge for the clinician, radiologist, andpathologist. Here, we present a case of a 70-year-old woman with history ofbreast carcinoma who presented with chronic constipation, early satiety, and anabdominal mass. Her first abdominal CT described a 3.6 cm × 5 cm × 4.5 cm cystic and solid mass involving the pancreatic tail that was suspicious for a pancreaticneoplasm. A subsequent abdominal CT described a 5.9 cm multilobulated solid andcystic lesion close to the pancreatic tail. Endoscopic ultrasound-guidedfine-needle aspirate of the mass demonstrated scant to moderate cellularity of a heterogeneous population of atypical cells, some with epithelioid morphology and others appearing neuroendocrine-like. By morphology and immunohistochemicalstains, an extra-adrenal paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma was considered as apossible diagnosis. The surgical resection specimen confirmed the diagnosis ofparaganglioma. This case demonstrates the importance of awareness ofparagangliomas in the differential diagnosis of a fine-needle aspiration of apancreatic mass to avoid erroneous diagnosis.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/dc.23974 PMID: 29882285
