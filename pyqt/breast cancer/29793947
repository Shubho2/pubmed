Acausal relationship between candidate DDR genes and endocrine treatment response,and the underlying mechanism, was then tested in ER+ breast cancer cell lines.RESULTS: Correlations between loss of expression of three genes: CETN2(p&lt;0.001) and ERCC1 (p=0.01) from the nucleotide excision repair (NER) andNEIL2 (p=0.04) from the base excision repair (BER) pathways were associated with endocrine treatment resistance in discovery data sets, and subsequently validatedin independent patient cohorts. Complementary mutation analysis supportedassociations between mutations in NER and BER pathways and reduced endocrinetreatment response. A causal role for CETN2, NEIL2 and ERCC1 loss in intrinsicendocrine resistance was experimentally validated in ER+ breast cancer celllines, and in ER+ patient-derived xenograft models. Loss of CETN2, NEIL2 or ERCC1induced endocrine treatment response by dysregulating G1/S transition, andtherefore, increased sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. A combined DDR signaturescore was developed that predicted poor outcome in multiple patient cohorts.CONCLUSIONS: This report identifies DDR defects as a new class of endocrinetreatment resistance drivers and indicates new avenues for predicting efficacy ofCDK4/6 inhibition in the adjuvant treatment setting.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-3702 PMID: 29793947
