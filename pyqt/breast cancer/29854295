Despite recent progress in definingmolecular pathways that confer endocrine resistance, the mechanisms that regulatechemotherapy response in luminal tumors remain largely elusive. Luminal tumorsoften express wild-type p53 that is a major determinant of the cellular DNAdamage response. Similar to p53, the second ER subtype, ERβ, has been reported toinhibit breast tumorigenesis by acting alone or in collaboration with p53.However, a synergistic mechanism of action has not been described. Here, wesuggest that ERβ relies on p53 to elicit its tumor repressive actions inERα-positive breast cancer cells. Upregulation of ERβ and treatment with ERβagonists potentiates the tumor suppressor function of p53 resulting in decreased survival. This effect requires molecular interaction between the two proteinsthat disrupts the inhibitory action of ERα on p53 leading to increasedtranscriptional activity of p53. In addition, we show that the same interactionalters the chemosensitivity of endocrine-resistant cells including their responseto tamoxifen therapy. Our results suggest a collaboration of ERβ and p53 tumorsuppressor activity in breast cancer cells that indicates the importance ofligand-regulated ERβ as a tool to target p53 activity and improve the clinicalmanagement of resistant disease.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25147 PMCID: PMC5976481PMID: 29854295
