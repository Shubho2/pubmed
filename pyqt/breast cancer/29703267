These women are not adequatelymonitored yet. Genetic testing may improve clearly the quality of breast cancerprevention programs. At present, blood samples are favored for obtaininghigh-quality DNA; however, DNA can also be obtained by collecting saliva. The aimof this study was, on the one hand, to determine whether saliva sampling is apracticable means to obtain sufficient quantity and quality of DNA and, on theother hand, whether it is accepted by patients throughout mammographicdiagnostics.METHODS: 67 consecutive women with diagnostic need for mammography with orwithout a family history for breast cancer were asked for their basic willingnessto undergo a genetic testing by saliva sample in addition to standarddiagnostics. Saliva samples were analyzed in terms of DNA quantity and quality.RESULTS: 64 (95.6%) women agreed to provide a saliva sample; 3 of them deniedparticipation. And even 63 out of 64 (98.4%) were interested in their specificresults. 45 out of 64 samples contained a DNA concentration above 50 ng/µl, 12samples were between 25 and 50 ng/µl and only 7 of them were under 25 ng/µl with the standard extraction procedure.CONCLUSION: A high number of patients seem to accept salvia samples as a riskassessment tool in breast diagnostics and are interested in their specific risksituation. At the same time, it could be demonstrated that it is an effective wayto provide high-quality DNA for breast cancer gene analysis. However, it remains to be shown whether it would be possible to integrate it with the same acceptancein a nationwide breast cancer screening program.DOI: 10.1186/s40001-018-0318-9 PMCID: PMC5921411PMID: 29703267
