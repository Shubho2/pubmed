However, this relation is based onstudies which combine all tumours smaller than 1.0 cm in a single category andall tumours larger than 5.0 cm in another category. This coarse classificationmay obscure a nuanced description of the effects of tumour size across the fullrange of possible sizes.METHODS: We examined the relationship between primary tumour size, lymph nodestatus and distant metastases in a cohort of 819,647 women diagnosed with firstprimary invasive breast cancer from 1990 to 2014 in the Surveillance,Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries database. All patients in thecohort had a known primary tumour size between 1 and 150 mm in greatestdimension. Primary tumour size was examined as a continuous (1-150 mm) andcategorical variable (15 size groups; 10-mm intervals). For each 1- or 10-mm sizegroup, we determined the proportion of patients with positive lymph nodes atdiagnosis, the proportion of patients with distant metastases at diagnosis andthe actuarial cumulative risk of breast cancer-specific mortality at 15 yearsfrom diagnosis.RESULTS: Among 819,647 patients with invasive breast tumours between 1 and 150 mmin size, there was a non-linear correlation between increasing tumour size andthe prevalence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis (% node-positive), theprevalence of distant metastases at diagnosis (% stage IV) and the 15-year rateof breast cancer-specific mortality across the entire size spectrum. For verysmall tumours (under 10 mm) and for very large tumours (larger than 60-90 mm)there was little correlation between tumour size and metastasis risk.CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between tumour size, lymph node status and distant metastases in patients with invasive breast cancer is not linear. This calls intoquestion the conventional model that the capacity for a primary breast tumour to metastasize increases as the tumour enlarges.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4796-9 PMCID: PMC6022519PMID: 29693227
