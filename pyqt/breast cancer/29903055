Manynanomedicines can only passively accumulate near leaky site of tumor vesselsthrough the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and cannot reach thedeep region of tumor. To improve the tumor targeting, penetration and retentionefficiency, an iRGD-mediated and enzyme-induced precise targeting goldnanoparticles system (iRGD/AuNPs-A&C) was developed by simply coadministering atumor-homing penetration peptide iRGD (CRGDKGPDC) with a legumain responsiveaggregable gold nanoparticle (AuNPs-A&C). In vitro, iRGD/AuNPs-A&C showed aconsistent increase rate in size with AuNPs-A&C, suggesting that iRGD/AuNPs-A&Ccould also aggregate in the presence of legumain, which was in favor of theenhanced retention in tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile, iRGD/AuNPs-A&C showedhigher 4T1 cells cellular uptake in vitro and presented higher penetration andaccumulation in breast tumor in vivo than AuNPs-A&C, leading to enhanced tumorimaging efficacy and the improved chemotherapeutic effect to 4T1-bearing mice.These results suggested that the iRGD-mediated and enzyme-induced dual-functionalnanoplatform was promising for the 4T1 tumor imaging and treatment.DOI: 10.1166/jbn.2018.2592 PMID: 29903055
