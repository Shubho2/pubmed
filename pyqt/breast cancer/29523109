In this study, we aimed to investigatethe biological effects of extract from AM on breast cancer cell and itsmechanism.METHODS: To prepare the extract, dried AM were ground and extracted with waterextraction-ethanol supernatant method. Then the main isoflavones in the extractwas detect by HPLC analysis. Furthermore, the anti-proliferative activity of AMextract was examined by MTT assay and morphological observation. Cell apoptosiswas evaluated with flow cytometric analysis. The expressions of total andphosphorylated PI3K, GS3Kβ, Akt and mTOR were determined by western blotanalysis.RESULTS: HPLC analysis demonstrated that AM extract contained with four kinds of isoflavones, campanulin, ononin, calycosin and formononetin. The MTT test andmorphological observation indicated that cells proliferation of MCF-7, SK-BR-3and MDA-MB-231were inhibited by AM extract in a dose dependent manner.Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis displayed that after treated with 25 μg/ml and 50 μg/ml AM extract, apoptosis of breast cancer cells was significantlyincreased as compared with DMSO and blank control group (all p < 0.05). Westernblot analysis found that the level of p-PI3K, p-GS3Kβ, p-Akt, and p-mTOR weresignificantly decreased, but the level of total-mTOR was observably increased as compared with DMSO control group.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the inhibited cell proliferation and induced cellapoptosis effect of AM extract via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway confirmed the anti-tumorpotential of AM. Therefore, our findings provide a new insight into anti-cancereffect of AM extract as a promising agent in breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s12906-018-2148-2 PMCID: PMC5845298PMID: 29523109  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
