Michael.Ladomery@uwe.ac.uk.BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence suggests that one of the ways that cells adapt tohypoxia is through alternative splicing. The aim of this study was firstly toexamine the effect of hypoxia on the alternative splicing of cancer associatedgenes using the prostate cancer cell line PC3 as a model. Secondly, the effect ofhypoxia on the expression of several regulators of splicing was examined.METHODS: PC3 cells were grown in 1% oxygen in a hypoxic chamber for 48 h, RNAextracted and sent for high throughput PCR analysis at the RNomics platform atthe University of Sherbrooke, Canada. Genes whose exon inclusion rate PSI (ψ)changed significantly were identified, and their altered exon inclusion ratesverified by RT-PCR in three cell lines. The expression of splice factors andsplice factor kinases in response to hypoxia was examined by qPCR and westernblotting. The splice factor kinase CLK1 was inhibited with the benzothiazoleTG003.RESULTS: In PC3 cells the exon inclusion rate PSI (ψ) was seen to change by > 25%in 12 cancer-associated genes; MBP, APAF1, PUF60, SYNE2, CDC42BPA, FGFR10P,BTN2A2, UTRN, RAP1GDS1, PTPN13, TTC23 and CASP9 (caspase 9). The expression ofthe splice factors SRSF1, SRSF2, SRSF3, SAM68, HuR, hnRNPA1, and of the splicefactor kinases SRPK1 and CLK1 increased significantly in hypoxia. We alsoobserved that the splice factor kinase CLK3, but not CLK2 and CLK4, was alsoinduced in hypoxic DU145 prostate, HT29 colon and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. Lastly, we show that the inhibition of CLK1 in PC3 cells with the benzothiazoleTG003 increased expression of the anti-apoptotic isoform caspase 9b.CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes in alternative splicing of cancer associatedgenes occur in prostate cancer cells in hypoxic conditions. The expression ofseveral splice factors and splice factor kinases increases during hypoxia, inparticular the Cdc-like splice factor kinases CLK1 and CLK3. We suggest that inhypoxia the elevated expression of these regulators of splicing helps cells adaptthrough alternative splicing of key cancer-associated genes. We suggest that the CLK splice factor kinases could be targeted in cancers in which hypoxiacontributes to resistance to therapy.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4227-7 PMCID: PMC5879922PMID: 29606096
