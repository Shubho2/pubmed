Here we analyze the whole exomes and transcriptomes of 187 primarytumors from a Korean BC cohort (SMC) enriched in pre-menopausal patients andperform systematic comparison with a primarily Caucasian and post-menopausal BCcohort (TCGA). SMC harbors higher proportions of HER2+ and Luminal B subtypes,lower proportion of Luminal A with decreased ESR1 expression compared to TCGA. Wealso observe increased mutation prevalence affecting BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 inSMC with an enrichment of a mutation signature linked to homologous recombinationrepair deficiency in TNBC. Finally, virtual microdissection and multivariateanalyses reveal that Korean BC status is independently associated with increased TIL and decreased TGF-Î² signaling expression signatures, suggesting that younger Asian BCs harbor more immune-active microenvironment than western BCs.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04129-4 PMCID: PMC5928087PMID: 29713003
