We searched PubMed, Embase, and the CochraneLibrary to identify prospective observational studies performed up to July 2017. Totally 11 prospective studies reported data on 79,988 renal transplantrecipients were included. Renal transplant recipients were found to display ahigher risk of all cancers (standard incidence ratio [SIR]: 2.89; 95% CI:2.13-3.91; P < 0.001), gastric cancer (SIR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.60-2.34; P < 0.001), colon cancer (SIR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.53-2.23; P < 0.001), pancreatic cancer (SIR:1.53; 95% CI: 1.23-1.91; P < 0.001), hepatocellular carcinoma (SIR: 2.45; 95% CI:1.63-3.66; P < 0.001), lung cancer (SIR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.29-2.19; P < 0.001),thyroid cancer (SIR: 5.04; 95% CI: 3.79-6.71; P < 0.001), urinary bladder cancer (SIR: 3.52; 95% CI: 1.48-8.37; P = 0.004), renal cell cancer (SIR: 10.77; 95% CI:6.40-18.12; P < 0.001), non-melanoma skin cancer (SIR: 12.14; 95% CI: 6.37-23.13;P < 0.001), melanoma (SIR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.08-5.67; P = 0.032), Hodgkin'slymphoma (SIR: 4.90; 95% CI: 3.09-7.78; P < 0.001), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR:10.66; 95% CI: 8.54-13.31; P < 0.001), lip cancer (SIR: 29.45; 95% CI:17.85-48.59; P < 0.001), breast cancer (SIR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.00-1.24; P = 0.046),and ovarian cancer (SIR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.23-2.07; P < 0.001). However, renaltransplantation did not significantly influence the risks of uterine cancer (P = 0.171), and prostate cancers (P = 0.188). Our findings suggest that patients who receive renal transplantation have an increased risk of cancer at most sites,apart from uterine and prostate cancers patients.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23841 PMCID: PMC5880611PMID: 29632651
