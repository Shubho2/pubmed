Box 2713 , Doha , Qatar.Letrozole (LTZ) is effective for the treatment of hormone-receptor-positivebreast cancer in postmenopausal women. In this work, and for the first time,using Vibrating Orifice Aerosol Generator (VOAG) technology, monodispersepoly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) and poly (D, L-Lactide) (PDLLA) LTZ-loadedmicroparticles were prepared and found to elicit selective high cytotoxicityagainst cancerous breast cells with no apparent toxicity on healthy cells invitro. Plackett-Burman experimental design was utilized to identify the mostsignificant factors affecting particle size distribution to optimize the preparedparticles. The generated microparticles were characterized in terms ofmicroscopic morphology, size, zeta potential, drug entrapment efficiency andrelease profile over one-month period. Long-term cytotoxicity of themicroparticles was also investigated using MCF-7 human breast cancer cell linesin comparison with primary mammary epithelial cells (MEC). The prepared polymericparticles were monodispersed, spherical and apparently smooth, regardless of the polymer used or the loaded LTZ concentration. Particle size varied from 15.6 µmto 91.6 µm and from 22.7 µm to 99.6 µm with size distribution (expressed as span values) ranging from 0.22 to 1.24 and from 0.29 to 1.48 for PCL and PDLLA basedmicroparticles, respectively. Upon optimizing the manufacture parameters, spanwas reduced to 0.162-0.195. Drug entrapment reached as high as 96.8%, and drugrelease from PDLLA and PCL followed a biphasic zero-order release using 5% or 30%w/w drug loading in the formulations. Long term in vitro cytotoxicity studiesindicated that microparticles formulations significantly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cell line over a prolonged period of time but did not have toxic effects onthe normal breast epithelial cells.DOI: 10.1080/03639045.2018.1503298 PMID: 30035646
