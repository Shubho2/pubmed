However, preanalytical variables may confound these assays. One of these factors is delay to formalin fixation (DFF). The purpose of this review is toevaluate each study that investigated the effect of DFF on breast biomarkers and other molecules.Methods: Thirteen primary research articles were identified by the literaturesearch. The credibility of the studies was judged based on the degree ofcontrolling other confounding factors. Nine studies had a prospective design witha high number of controlled variables.Results: Most of the studies concluded that DFF had an effect on ER/PR/HER2. Someof these studies showed that DFF had negative effect on other markers used eitherclinically or for research purposes.Conclusions: The vast majority of the studies agree that DFF has negative effect on breast biomarkers.DOI: 10.1093/ajcp/aqx164 PMID: 29471352
