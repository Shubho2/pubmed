[Epub ahead ofprint]Association of Genetic Variants in NF-kB with Susceptibility to Breast Cancer: a Case Control Study.Ghali RM(1)(2), Mahjoub S(1), Zaied S(3), Bhiri H(3), Bahia W(1), Mahjoub T(1),Almawi WY(4)(5).Author information: (1)Laboratory of Human Genome and Multifactorial Diseases (LR12ES07), Faculty of Pharmacy of Monastir, University of Monastir, Monastir, Tunisia.(2)Faculty of Sciences of Bizerte, University of Carthage, Carthage, Tunisia.(3)Department of Clinical Oncology, CHU Fattouma Bourguiba, Monastir, Tunisia.(4)Faculty of Sciences of Tunis (FST), El-Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.wassim.almawi@outlook.com.(5)School of Pharmacy, Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon.wassim.almawi@outlook.com.Insofar as altered NF-κB signaling stemming from the presence of specific geneticvariants in NF-κB gene contribute to cancer pathogenesis, this study evaluatedthe association between NF-κB rs147574894/I552V, rs148626207/M860T rs3774937 and rs1598859 variants and breast cancer and associated features and complications.This was a retrospective case-control study, which involved 207 women with breastcancer, and 214 cancer-free women who served as controls. NF-κB genotyping wasdone by real-time PCR. Significantly higher rs3774937 minor allele frequencies(MAF), and lower rs147574894 MAF were seen among breast cancer patients, thereby imparting disease susceptibility and protective nature to these variants,respectively. Significant association of rs3774937 and rs147574894 genotypes withbreast cancer was seen under the dominant model. Histological type and grade,molecular type, Her2 positivity and ER+/Her2- correlated positively, whiledistant metastasis negatively correlated with rs3774937. On the other hand,rs147574894 negatively correlated with histological type and grade, tumor size,Her2 positivity, molecular type, and ER+/Her2-, while rs148626207 correlatedpositively with histological grade, but negatively with distant metastasis andtriple-negative status. Breast cancer-susceptible and -protective 4-locushaplotypes were also identified. This is the first report that addresses thecontribution of NF-κB variants to the pathogenesis of breast cancer in MiddleEastern-North African population, and the first to document positive association of rs3774937 with breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s12253-018-0452-2 PMID: 30027470
