Search of an effective therapy can be started with the understanding of the generation of such"carcinogens" and their biological interactions. This review is to discuss thesyntheses, structural activities, mechanistic and biological studies ofpolyarenes such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polycyclic azaarenes (PAAs) and their thia-analogs (PASH). It also summarizes the mechanism ofmutagenicity and tumorigenicity via metabolic interventions producing diolepoxide complexes and eventually formation of DNA adducts. It suggests thatinhibition of oxidative reactions and formation of diols and epoxides andunspecific intracellular activation of cytochrome P450 enzymes could beapproaches in therapy against such mutagenicity and tumorigenicity. Thus, thisreview reflects that understanding of molecular mechanisms and activations along with a clinical and translational medicine approach would require achieving both prevention and treatment of this atrocity.© 2018 The Chemical Society of Japan & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
