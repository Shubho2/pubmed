Although the cellular functions ofPRMT5 have not been fully unraveled, it has been implicated in a number ofcellular processes like RNA processing, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation. PRMT5 is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues and its expressionhas been shown to be elevated in several cancers including breast cancer, gastriccancer, glioblastoma, and lymphoma. Here, we describe the identification andcharacterization of a novel and selective PRMT5 inhibitor with potent in vitroand in vivo activity. Compound 1 (also called LLY-283) inhibited PRMT5 enzymatic activity in vitro and in cells with IC50 of 22 ± 3 and 25 ± 1 nM, respectively,while its diastereomer, compound 2 (also called LLY-284), was much less active.Compound 1 also showed antitumor activity in mouse xenografts when dosed orallyand can serve as an excellent probe molecule for understanding the biologicalfunction of PRMT5 in normal and cancer cells.DOI: 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.8b00014 PMCID: PMC6047023 [Available on 2019-07-12]PMID: 30034588
