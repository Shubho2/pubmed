We considered genetic modifiers of risk for carriers of high-riskmutations in other breast cancer susceptibility genes.METHODS: In a family known to carry the high-risk mutation PALB2:c.3113G>A(p.Trp1038*), whole-exome sequencing was performed on germline DNA from fouraffected women, three of whom were mutation carriers.RESULTS: RNASEL:p.Glu265* was identified in one of the PALB2 carriers who had twoprimary invasive breast cancer diagnoses before 50 years. Gene-panel testing ofBRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and RNASEL in the Australian Breast Cancer Family Registryidentified five carriers of RNASEL:p.Glu265* in 591 early onset breast cancercases. Three of the five women (60%) carrying RNASEL:p.Glu265* also carried apathogenic mutation in a breast cancer susceptibility gene compared with 30carriers of pathogenic mutations in the 586 non-carriers of RNASEL:p.Glu265* (5%)(p < 0.002). Taqman genotyping demonstrated that the allele frequency ofRNASEL:p.Glu265* was similar in affected and unaffected Australian women,consistent with other populations.CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that RNASEL:p.Glu265* may be a genetic modifier ofrisk for early-onset breast cancer predisposition in carriers of high-riskmutations. Much larger case-case and case-control studies are warranted to testthe association observed in this report.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4028-z PMCID: PMC5806316PMID: 29422015
