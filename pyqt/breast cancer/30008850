China.The objective of the present study was to investigate and analyze theepithelial-cadherin (E-cadherin) expression in invasive ductal carcinoma of thebreast, and to analyze the associations between the expression andclinicopathological characteristics of lymph node metastasis and the prognosis ofbreast cancer. The immunohistochemical streptavidin-peroxidase method was used todetect the E-cadherin expression in 30 cases of breast fibroadenoma and in 450cases of invasive breast cancer, and then the χ2test and Kaplan-Meier method wereused to analyze the data. The 30 cases of breast fibroadenoma showed positiveexpression of E-cadherin. Specifically, results found that E-cadherin was highly expressed in 49.04% (77/157) of patients with non-metastatic breast cancer, whilelow expression was found in 50.96% (80/157). Additionally, E-cadherin was highly expressed in 29.69% (87/293) of patients with lymph node metastasis of breastcancer, with low expression in 70.31% (206/293); these differences weresignificantly different (χ2=16.53; P<0.001). E-cadherin was expressed in 35.48%(22/62), 33.73% (84/249), 63.83% (30/47) and 30.43% (28/92) of patients withluminal A type, luminal B type, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), respectively. It was found thatpatients with high expression of E-cadherin had a better prognosis than the lowexpression group with regards to TNBC, and this result was significantlydifferent (χ2=4.48; P=0.034). In conclusion, low E-cadherin expression wasassociated with lymph node metastasis in invasive breast cancer, and the patientswith low expression also had a poor prognosis compared with those in the highexpression group. The present results suggested that E-cadherin could be used in a prognostic index for patients with lymph node metastasis and TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8836 PMCID: PMC6036376PMID: 30008850
