They promote host defense and contribute to tissue and metabolic homeostasis,wound healing and immune surveillance. Their role in human cancer immunity isless defined, and therefore we aimed to identify the frequency and phenotype ofdistinct ILC groups in various types of cancer.METHODS: Tissue samples and peripheral blood were collected from patientsundergoing surgical resection of gastrointestinal and breast tumours. Single cellsuspension of tumour tissue was immediately obtained following surgery usingtumour dissociation.RESULTS: We observed significantly higher frequencies of ILC2 (p value: 0.04) in malignant breast cancer tissue and significantly higher frequencies of group 1ILC (p value: 0.001) in malignant gastrointestinal tumours. Tumour infiltratingILC were found to show an activated phenotype with higher expression of MHC-II,KLRG1, early activation marker CD69 and CD44.CONCLUSIONS: Activated innate lymphoid cells infiltrate tumours dependent ontumour type and location.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4262-4 PMCID: PMC5870240PMID: 29587679
