Novel therapeutic agents with excellentcentral nervous system (CNS) penetration and therapeutic activity are urgentlyneeded. EDO-S101 is a novel alkylating and histone deacetylase inhibiting agentcreated by covalent fusion of bendamustine and vorinostat. We used murine models to perform CNS pharmacokinetic analysis and preclinical therapeutic evaluation ofEDO-S101 for CNS lymphoma, metastatic triple-negative breast cancer of the brain,and glioblastoma multiforme. EDO-S101 has excellent CNS penetration of 13.8% and 16.5% by intravenous infusion and bolus administration respectively. It showspromising therapeutic activity against CNS lymphoma, metastatic triple-negativebreast cancer of the brain, and glioblastoma multiforme with significantprolongation of survival compared to no-treatment controls. Therapeutic activity was higher with IV infusion compared to IV bolus. It should be evaluated further for therapeutic use in brain tumors.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25588 PMCID: PMC6021334PMID: 29963268
