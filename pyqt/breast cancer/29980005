Patients in both groups were providedwith intravenous patient-controlled analgesia device containing morphine forpostoperative analgesia.MEASUREMENTS: Morphine consumption and numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scoreswere recorded at 1, 6, 12 and 24 h postoperatively.MAIN RESULTS: Morphine consumption at postoperative hours 1, 6, 12 and 24decreased significantly in the ESP group (p < 0.05 for each time interval). Totalmorphine consumption decreased by 65% at 24 h compared to the control group(5.76 ± 3.8 mg vs 16.6 ± 6.92 mg). There was no statistically significantdifference between the groups in terms of NRS scores.CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings show that US-guided ESP block exhibits asignificant analgesic effect in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.Further studies comparing different regional anesthesia techniques are needed to identify the optimal analgesia technique for this group of patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
