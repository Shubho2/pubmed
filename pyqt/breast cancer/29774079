However, the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) inTGF-β-induced Slug activation and EMT remains largely unknown. Methods: In thisstudy, we used microarray analysis to compare lncRNA expression profiles between TGF-β treated and untreated breast cancer cells. Then, the clinical significance of lncRNAs in breast cancer was investigated by qPCR and Kaplan-Meier survivalanalysis. The molecular mechanisms and EMT-promoting effects in vitro wereanalyzed by confocal laser microscopy, Western blotting, chromosome conformation capture (3C), chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP), ChIP, luciferasereporter assay and transwell migration assay. Lastly, the pro-metastatic effects in vivo were evaluated by bioluminescent imaging and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Results: We observed that TGF-β induced genome-wide changes in lncRNAlevels in breast cancer cells, among which AC026904.1 and UCA1 were highlyexpressed in metastatic breast cancer and closely associated with poor prognosis.Mechanistic study revealed that AC026904.1 and UCA1 were upregulated bynon-canonical and canonical TGF-β pathways, respectively. Further analysis showedthat AC026904.1 functions as an enhancer RNA in the nucleus, whereas UCA1 exerts a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) activity in the cytoplasm. In addition, the biological functions of these two lncRNAs converged on the activation andmaintenance of Slug, constituting a one-two punch in promoting EMT and tumormetastasis. Conclusion: These findings uncover for the first time that AC026904.1and UCA1 could cooperatively upregulate Slug expression at both transcriptionaland post-transcriptional levels, exerting critical roles in TGF-β-induced EMT.The present work provides new evidence that lncRNAs function as key regulators ofEMT and hold great promise to be used as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targetsfor metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.7150/thno.23463 PMCID: PMC5957013PMID: 29774079
