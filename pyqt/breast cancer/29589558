In problems wherestrong individual markers are not available, or where interactions between geneproducts are of primary interest, it may be necessary to consider combinations offeatures as a marker family. To this end, recent work proposes a hierarchicalBayesian framework for feature selection that places a prior on the set offeatures we wish to select and on the label-conditioned feature distribution.While an analytical posterior under Gaussian models with block covariancestructures is available, the optimal feature selection algorithm for this modelremains intractable since it requires evaluating the posterior over the space of all possible covariance block structures and feature-block assignments. Toaddress this computational barrier, in prior work we proposed a simple suboptimalalgorithm, 2MNC-Robust, with robust performance across the space of blockstructures. Here, we present three new heuristic feature selection algorithms.RESULTS: The proposed algorithms outperform 2MNC-Robust and many other popularfeature selection algorithms on synthetic data. In addition, enrichment analysis on real breast cancer, colon cancer, and Leukemia data indicates they also outputmany of the genes and pathways linked to the cancers under study.CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian feature selection is a promising framework for small-samplehigh-dimensional data, in particular biomarker discovery applications. Whenapplied to cancer data these algorithms outputted many genes already shown to be involved in cancer as well as potentially new biomarkers. Furthermore, one of theproposed algorithms, SPM, outputs blocks of heavily correlated genes,particularly useful for studying gene interactions and gene networks.DOI: 10.1186/s12859-018-2059-8 PMCID: PMC5872553PMID: 29589558
