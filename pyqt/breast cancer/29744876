Cancer stemcells (CSC) are thought to be responsible for the aggressive and metastaticnature of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), and new therapeutic strategiesare being devised to target them. Flubendazole (FLU) is a widely usedanthelmintic agent that also exhibits anticancer activity in several cancertypes. The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism of action of FLUon breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)-like properties and metastasis in TNBC. FLUtreatment caused a significant induction of apoptosis, accompanied by G2/M phase accumulation, caspase-3/-7 activation and the dysregulation of STAT3 activationin TNBC cells. The latter phenomenon was associated with impairment of cancerstem-like traits, concomitant with a reduction in the CD24low /CD44high ,CD24high /CD49fhigh subpopulation, ALDH1 activity and mammosphere formation. The BCSC-enriched populations exhibited enhanced metastasis with higher STAT3activation, while FLU administration inhibited tumor growth, angiogenesis andlung and liver metastasis, coinciding with decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels incirculating blood. FLU kills not only rapid proliferating tumor cells but alsoeffectively eradicates BCSC-like cells in vitro and in vivo. Our findings warrantfurther investigation of FLU as a treatment for metastatic TNBC.Â© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31585 PMID: 29744876
