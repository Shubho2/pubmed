Wesought to compare the personal and family cancer histories of TP53-positiveresult (TP53+) carriers who were identified by either MGPT or SGT.Methods: Of 44 310 individuals who underwent testing of TP53 in a single clinicaldiagnostic laboratory between 2010 and 2014, 44 086 (40 885 MGPT and 3201 SGT)met study eligibility criteria. Personal cancer histories were available for 38938 subjects. The frequency of germline TP53 results and various phenotypicmanifestations were compared according to test type. All statistical tests weretwo-sided.Results: MGPT TP53+ individuals (n = 126) had an older median age at first cancerthan SGT TP53+ carriers (n = 96; women: median = 36 vs 28 years, P < .001; andmen: median = 40 vs 15 years, P = .004). The median age of breast cancerdiagnosis was 40 years in MGPT TP53+ women vs 33 years in SGT TP53+ women (P <.001). In both cohorts, childhood and LFS core cancers, and for women, multipleprimary cancers (not multiple breast tumors), were associated with TP53+ results.Established LFS testing criteria were less often met by MGPT TP53+ individuals.Conclusions: MGPT TP53+ individuals differ in phenotype from those ascertainedthrough SGT and are notably older at cancer diagnosis and less likely to meet LFSclinical criteria. These findings suggest that LFS may have a greater phenotypic spectrum than previously appreciated. This has implications for the counseling ofMGPT TP53+ individuals. Prospective follow-up of these individuals and familiesis needed to re-evaluate cancer risks.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy001 PMID: 29529297
