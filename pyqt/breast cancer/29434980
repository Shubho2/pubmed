It has previously been demonstrated that theremoval of fucose from antibody oligosaccharides (defucosylation) leads toaugmentation of ADCC activity. To establish clinically relevant evidence of this procedure, the present study evaluated trastuzumab- and cetuximab-mediated ADCCby comparing defucosylated mAbs with conventional mAbs using peripheral bloodmononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were isolated from 20 patients withgastrointestinal tract cancer and 10 healthy volunteers. ADCCs were measuredusing PBMCs as effector cells and two gastric cancer cell lines as target cells. ADCCs were significantly enhanced with defucosylated mAbs compared withconventional mAbs using PBMC from the healthy donors and patients with cancer.The results confirmed that the cetuximab- and trastuzumab-mediated ADCCs inadvanced disease were impaired in comparison to those in early disease or healthyindividuals. However, when the defucosylated mAbs were used instead of theconventional mAbs, the ADCC activities in the advanced cases were almostcomparable with those in early disease or healthy individuals. Furthermore, theexpression of ADCC associated molecules were modified toward immunosuppressivestatus with a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor in vitro, theconventional cetuximab- and trastuzumab-mediated ADCC was downregulated, and the defucosylated mAbs overcome the downregulation of ADCC. In conclusion,defucosylated therapeutic mAbs may enhance ADCC activities in patients withcancer, which may lead to more effective anti-cancer treatments.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7556 PMCID: PMC5777280PMID: 29434980
