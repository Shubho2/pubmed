This approach identified AFAP1-AS1 as a triple negative breastcancer-specific gene associated with cell proliferation andepithelial-mesenchymal-transition. In addition, our chromatin mapping data inbasal TNBC cell lines are consistent with gene expression patterns in TCGA thatindicate decreased activity of the androgen receptor pathway but increasedactivity of the vitamin D biosynthesis pathway.CONCLUSIONS: Together, these datasets provide a comprehensive resource forhistone modification profiles that define epigenetic landscapes and reveal keychromatin signatures in breast cancer cell line subtypes with potential toidentify novel and actionable targets for treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s12864-018-4533-0 PMCID: PMC5819162PMID: 29458327
