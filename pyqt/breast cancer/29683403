In this study, the paracellulartightness and functional expression of efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) were evaluated in mouse brainimmortalized cell line bEnd3 to prove it as a useful BBB-mimicking system forbiological and pharmacological research. Methods The presence of P-gp, BCRP andtight junction proteins occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 were validated by RT-PCR andWestern blot. The tightness of bEnd3 monolayers was evaluated by measuring thepermeability of hydrophilic marker Lucifer yellow. The P-gp functionality wasidentified by intracellular uptake assay using Rhodamine 123 (R123) as P-gpsubstrate and verapamil as P-gp inhibitor. The BCRP functionality was identified by flow cytometric analysis of mitoxantrone accumulation and fluorescencemicroscopic analysis of Hoechst 33342 accumulation using Ko-143 as BCRPinhibitor. Results The bEnd3 cells demonstrated the expression of P-gp, BCRP and tight junction proteins occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 at mRNA and protein levels. The permeability coefficient of Lucifer yellow was 1.3 ± 0.13 × 10-3 cm/min,indicating the moderate paracellular tightness barrier formed by bEnd3 cells. Theverapamil induced a higher cellular uptake of Rhodamine 123, and Ko-143significantly elevated cellular accumulation of mitoxantrone and Hoechst 33342,suggesting the P-gp and BCRP functionality shown by bEnd3 cells. Conclusions The bEnd3 cell line represents a useful in vitro tool for studying BBBcharacteristics and drug transport mechanisms at the BBB.DOI: 10.1080/01616412.2018.1460701 PMID: 29683403
