Epub 2018 May 5.3-Nitroacridine derivatives arrest cell cycle at G0/G1 phase and induce apoptosisin human breast cancer cells may act as DNA-target anticancer agents.Zhou Q(1), You C(1), Zheng C(2), Gu Y(2), Gu H(2), Zhang R(2), Wu H(1), Sun B(3).Author information: (1)School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing210089, China.(2)Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Southeast UniversityChenxian College, Nanjing 210000, China.(3)School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing210089, China. Electronic address: chmsunbw@seu.edu.cn.DNA is considered to be one of the most promising targets for anticancer agents. Acridine analogues have anticancer activity based on DNA binding andtopoisomerases inhibition. However, due to the side effects, resistance and lowbioavailability, a few have entered into clinical usage and the mechanisms ofaction are not fully understood. Novel acridine derivatives are needed foreffective cancer therapy. A series of novel 3-nitroacridine-based derivativeswere synthesized, their DNA binding and anticancer activities were evaluated. Thechemical modifications at position 9 of the 3-nitroacridine were crucial for DNA affinity, thus optimizing anticancer activity. UV-Vis and circular dichroism (CD)spectroscopy indicated interaction of compounds with DNA, and the binding modeswere intercalation and groove binding. MTT assay and clonogenic assay showed thatcompounds 1, 2 and 3 had obvious cell growth inhibition effect. They induced cellapoptosis in human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, and exhibited anticancer effect via DNA damage as well as cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phage.Using confocal fluorescent microscope, the apoptotic features were observed. The results suggested that compounds 1-3 with high DNA binding affinity and goodinhibitory effect of cancer cell proliferation can be developed as primecandidates for further chemical optimization.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
