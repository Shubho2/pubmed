Manyantipsychotics cause serum hyperprolactinemia as an adverse side effect;prolactin-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling both induces cell differentiation and suppresses apoptosis.It is controversial whether these antipsychotics increase breast cancer risk.METHODS: We investigated the impact of several antipsychotics on mammarytumorigenesis initiated by retrovirus-mediated delivery of either ErbB2 or HRasor by transgenic expression of Wnt-1.RESULTS: We found that the two hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics,risperidone and pimozide, prompted precancerous lesions to progress to cancerwhile aripiprazole, which did not cause hyperprolactinemia, did not. We observed that risperidone and pimozide (but not aripiprazole) caused precancerous cells toactivate STAT5 and suppress apoptosis while exerting no impact on proliferation. Importantly, we demonstrated that these effects of antipsychotics on earlylesions required the STAT5 gene function. Furthermore, we showed that onlytwo-week treatment of mice with ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, blocked STAT5activation, restored apoptosis, and prevented early lesion progression.CONCLUSIONS: Hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics instigate precancerouscells to progress to cancer via JAK/STAT5 to suppress the apoptosis anticancerbarrier, and these cancer-promoting effects can be prevented by prophylacticanti-JAK/STAT5 treatment. This preclinical work exposes a potential breast cancerrisk from hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics in certain patients andsuggests a chemoprevention regime that is relatively easy to implement comparedto the standard 5-year anti-estrogenic treatment in women who have or likely havealready developed precancerous lesions while also requiringhyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0969-z PMCID: PMC5960176PMID: 29778097
