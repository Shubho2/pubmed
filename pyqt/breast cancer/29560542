We developed adata-driven approach to discover new terms for RadLex by mining a large corpus ofradiology reports using natural language processing (NLP) methods. Our system,developed for mammography, discovers new candidate terms by analyzing nounphrases in free-text reports to extend the mammography part of RadLex. Our NLPsystem extracts noun phrases from free-text mammography reports and classifiesthese noun phrases as "Has Candidate RadLex Term" or "Does Not Have CandidateRadLex Term." We tested the performance of our algorithm using 100 free-textmammography reports. An expert radiologist determined the true positive and true negative RadLex candidate terms. We calculated precision/positive predictivevalue and recall/sensitivity metrics to judge the system's performance. Finally, to identify new candidate terms for enhancing RadLex, we applied our NLP methodto 270,540 free-text mammography reports obtained from three academicinstitutions. Our method demonstrated precision/positive predictive value of 0.77(159/206 terms) and aÂ recall/sensitivity of 0.94 (159/170 terms). The overallaccuracy of the system is 0.80 (235/293 terms). When we ran our system on the setof 270,540 reports, it found 31,800 unique noun phrases that are potentialcandidates for RadLex. Our data-driven approach to mining radiology reports canidentify new candidate terms for expanding the breast imaging lexicon portion of RadLex and may be a useful approach for discovering new candidate terms fromother radiology domains.DOI: 10.1007/s10278-018-0064-0 PMID: 29560542
