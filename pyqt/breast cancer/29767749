However, a stop-gain mutation,K3326* (rs11571833), confers risk of lung cancer and cancers of theupper-aero-digestive tract but only a modest risk of breast or ovarian cancer.The Icelandic population provides an opportunity for comprehensivecharacterization of the cancer risk profiles of K3326* and HBOC mutations becausea single mutation, BRCA2 999del5, is responsible for almost all BRCA2-relatedHBOC in the population.Methods: Genotype information on 43 641 cancer patients and 370 971 controlsubjects from Iceland, the Netherlands, and the United States was used to assess the cancer risk profiles of K3326* and BRCA2 999del5. BRCA2 expression wasassessed using RNAseq data from blood (n = 2233), as well as 52 tissues reported in the GTEx database.Results: The cancer risks associated with K3326* are fundamentally different fromthose associated with 999del5. We report for the first time an associationbetween K3326* and small cell lung cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 2.06, 95% confidenceinterval [CI] = 1.35 to 3.16) and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (OR = 1.69,95% CI = 1.26 to 2.26). Individuals homozygous for K3326* reach old age and have children. Unlike BRCA2 999del5, the K3326* allele does not affect the level ofBRCA2 transcripts, and the allele is expressed to the same extent as thewild-type allele.Conclusions: K3326* associates primarily with cancers that have strongenvironmental genotoxic risk factors. Expression of the K3326* allele suggeststhat a variant protein may be made that retains the DNA repair capabilitiesimportant to hormone-responsive tissues but may be less efficient in respondingto genotoxic stress.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy002 PMID: 29767749
