Patients were divided into four groups: those with neoadjuvantchemotherapy only, adjuvant chemotherapy only, both adjuvant and neoadjuvant, andthose with no chemotherapy. Outcomes of interest included SSI and timing ofpost-operative SSI.RESULTS: A total of 949 reconstructions were performed over the study period.Subgroup breakdown was as follows: A total of 56 (5.9%) neoadjuvant only, 173(18.2%) adjuvant only, 18 (1.9%) both, and 702 (74.0%) none. Overall infectionrates were 10.7%, 10.4%, 22.2%, and 6.1% in the four groups, respectively(P = 0.015). On multivariate analysis, no significant differences were observedwhen comparing presence or absence of chemotherapy in the overall reconstruction cohort or when subgrouped by reconstruction modality-autologous or alloplastic.There were no significant differences in time from neoadjuvant chemotherapy tosurgery date noted between patients who developed a post-operative SSI and those who did not (4.40 ± 1.58 vs 4.72 ± 1.39 weeks; P = 0.517).CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy timing did not increase the odds of surgical siteinfections in patients undergoing immediate breast reconstruction.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jso.25053 PMID: 29574751  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
