However, there arefew detailed evaluations of patient adherence to anastrozole(ANA)therapy. Here,we evaluated the adherence to ANA therapy in postoperative patients with primary breast cancer.METHODS: We investigated 102 postoperative patients with primary breast cancerwithout distant metastasis, who received ANA at JCHO Kyusyu Hospital. Wecalculated the medication continuation rate and disease-free survival at 5 years from the initiation of medication. The reasons for medication discontinuation andalternative drug therapy after ANA therapy discontinuation were alsoinvestigated. Re- sults: The 5-year continuation rate of ANA treatment alone was 79%(81/102). The rate of all patients who continued ANA treatment, including 9who changed to other drugs, was 88%(90/102). The most frequent ANAdiscontinuation reasons were progressive disease(8 cases), arthritis(5 cases),and nausea(3 cases). The disease-free survival rate was 92%(94/102), and theoverall survival rate was 97%(99/102).CONCLUSION: ANA showed a high continuation rate. Adherence of ANA inpostoperative patients with breast cancer was well maintained, even when thetreatment was changed to other drugs due to adverse events.PMID: 30026423
