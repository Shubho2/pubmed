Axillary lymph node dissection can be reserved for patients with a high axillary nodal burden. We aim to determine the preoperative factorsthat could distinguish between low and high axillary nodal burden in Z0011eligible patients with a needle biopsy proven metastatic node.METHOD: Patients who fulfilled Z0011 trial criteria with a positive lymph nodeneedle biopsy and had axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were recruited. Thesepatients were classified into low and high nodal burden subgroups, defined ashaving 1-2 and ≥3 metastatic lymph nodes, respectively. The clinical,radiological and pathological features between the 2 subgroups were compared.RESULTS: 70 (40%) and 105 (60%) patients had low and high nodal burdenrespectively. The high nodal burden subgroup was more likely to have onultrasound ≥3 abnormal lymph nodes (37.14% versus 4.29%) (P < 0.0001) and maximumcortical thickness >4 mm (31.43% versus 10.0%) (P = 0.0036). Multivariateanalysis revealed abnormal lymph nodes ≥3 to have an odds ratio of 20.72 (95% CI 5.91-72.65) P < 0.0001.CONCLUSION: ≥3 abnormal lymph nodes on ultrasound was the most significantpredictor of high nodal burden subgroup in Z0011 eligible patients with apositive lymph node needle biopsy. This information could allow this subgroup to proceed to an upfront ALND and avoid the need of a sentinel lymph node biopsy in the post Z0011 trial era.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
