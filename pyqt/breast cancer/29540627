Our previous study revealed cancer screening rates in Japanese people withschizophrenia lower than rates of approximately 40% of the general population.However, that study was based on self-reports, which can be inaccurate, and ratesdid not differentiate the types of cancer screening provider (i.e., municipalscreening, collective opportunistic screening, and individual opportunisticscreening). This study aimed to investigate records-based cancer screening rates,focusing on participation rates of people with schizophrenia who are subject tomunicipal cancer screening programs. We conducted a cross-sectional study at apsychiatric hospital outpatient clinic from September to November 2016. Werandomly extracted 420 potential participants from among 680 eligible patientsand asked them to participate. We then selected subgroups of participants living in Okayama city who were enrolled in the National Health Insurance or PublicAssistance systems and were subject to colorectal, gastric, lung, breast, orcervical cancer screening provided by Okayama city (n = 97, 96, 97, 42, and 64,respectively). Participation in cancer screenings was assessed based on localgovernment records. Municipal cancer screening rates were as follows: 13.4% (95% confidence interval: 6.6%-20.2%) for colorectal, 7.3% (2.1%-12.5%) for gastric,16.5% (9.1%-23.9%) for lung, 21.4% (9.0%-33.8%) for breast, and 14.1%(5.6%-22.6%) for cervical cancers. The findings demonstrated extremely low cancerscreening rates among people with schizophrenia subject to municipal cancerscreenings in Japan. A strategy to promote municipal cancer screening for people with schizophrenia is needed.DOI: 10.1620/tjem.244.209 PMID: 29540627
