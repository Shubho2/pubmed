The term-pregnancies number was a significantrisk-reducing factor for breast cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR perpregnancy, 0.640; 95% CI, 0.508-0.806; P < .001), for breast cancers in BRCA2mutation carriers (HR per pregnancy, 0.534; 95% CI, 0.419-0.681; P < .001), andfor ovarian cancers for BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR per pregnancy, 0.625; 95% CI,0.474-0.824; P = .001).CONCLUSION: Among Korean women with the BRCA1/2 mutation, the location of themutations may influence the risk of breast and ovarian cancers according to theputative functional domain regions. Further investigations are required for risk prediction and preventive strategies in the BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
