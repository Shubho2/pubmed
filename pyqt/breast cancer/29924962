[Epub ahead of print]Prognostic value of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) in invasive breastcarcinomas.Demir H(1), Dulgar O, Gulle BT, Turna H, Ilvan S.Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Cerrahpasa School of Medicine, Istanbul University,Istanbul, Turkey. patdrhd1@hotmail.com.Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) has been identified as a marker of cancer stemcells in breast cancer (BC). Recent studies showed that ALDH1 expression iscorrelated with poor prognostic parameters and worse clinical outcome in BC. Weevaluated ALDH1 expression by immunohistochemistry in a series of 217 invasiveBCs and investigated the correlation between ALDH1 expression andclinicopathological parameters, molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2] type, and triple-negative BC [TNBC]),and patient survival. There was a significant association between ALDH1expression and tumor grade (p < 0.001), i.e., the expression of ALDH1 was higher in high-grade tumors. ALDH1 expression was significantly associated with estrogenand progesterone receptor (ER and PR) negativity (p < 0.001) and HER2 positivity (p = 0.001). ALDH1 expression ratios were higher in HER2 type and TNBC. There wasa statistically significant correlation between ALDH1 negativity and luminal Asubtype (p < 0.001). The overall and disease free survival were shorter in ALDH1+tumors, although without statistical significance. We confirm that ALDH1 is apotentially important, poor prognostic factor in BC, associated with highhistological grade, ER/PR negativity and HER2 positivity. For more accurateresults, ALDH1 expression should be evaluated in larger case series includingvarious types/subtypes of BC.DOI: 10.17305/bjbms.2018.3094 PMID: 29924962
