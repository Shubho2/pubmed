A pilot triaging system was introduced in St Vincent's UniversityHospital to streamline these services. Women over 35 years who do not meet urgentreferral criteria are referred for a mammogram prior to a clinic appointment("image first"). The aim of this study was to retrospectively determine therecall rates, biopsy rates, and rate of breast cancer identification within this cohort of patients. This was compared to a screening population of patients.METHODS: Patients triaged into the "image first" group within a one-year periodwere identified. Results of the initial mammogram, further imaging and subsequentbiopsies were recorded. Data relating to number of recalls, number of patientsbiopsied and number of cancers identified within the Merrion Unit of the NationalBreastcheck Screening Program was obtained for comparison.RESULTS: One thousand six hundred eighty-eight referrals were triaged as "imagefirst" over this period. 185 (11%) of patients required a biopsy of an identifiedlesion. Breast cancer was diagnosed in 65 patients (3.9%). During the same study period, of the 42,099 women who were screened for breast cancer, 496 (1.8%)underwent biopsy and 267 (0.63%) were diagnosed with breast cancer.CONCLUSION: Image first patients, who represent a cohort of "symptomatic"non-urgent women, have a greater rate of breast cancer detection than anasymptomatic screening population. This may have an impact on the appropriatetriaging of symptomatic women in a national cancer center.DOI: 10.1007/s11845-018-1794-1 PMID: 29582346
