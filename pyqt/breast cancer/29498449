Epub 2018 Mar 2.HER2 equivocal breast cancer that is positive by alternative probe HER2 FISH are classified as HER2 negative by Oncotype DX.Tozbikian GH(1), Zynger DL(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University,Columbus, OH, USA.In breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status isdetermined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or in situ hybridization. OncotypeDX also reports HER2 status by an rt-PCR-based assay. Assay concordance betweenIHC and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (including alternative probeHER2 FISH) vs Oncotype DX HER2 rt-PCR has not been described in the post-2013American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP)HER2 Guideline revision setting. We performed a retrospective review of HER2equivocal invasive breast carcinoma from 2014 to 2016 with the Oncotype DX HER2result. Fifteen patients with HER2 equivocal invasive breast cancer had Oncotype DX performed. Of these, 13 underwent alternative probe HER2 FISH yielding 4negative, 6 equivocal and 3 positive results. All 15 cases were classified asHER2 negative by Oncotype DX rt-PCR, including the three cases which werepositive by alternative probe HER2 FISH, yielding a discordance rate for OncotypeDX rt-PCR HER2 of 20% (3/15). All three patients with HER2-positive breast canceron the basis of alternative probe HER2 FISH received anti-HER2-targeted therapy. Treatment decisions based on HER2 status should utilize the IHC/FISH result asOncotype DX results may incorrectly disqualify some patients from being eligible for anti-HER2 therapy based on the current 2013 ASCO/CAP HER2 Guidelines.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13004 PMID: 29498449
