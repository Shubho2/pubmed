It could not only be used as a clinical biomarker for the early diagnosisand prognosis evaluation in a variety of cancers but also promote the developmentand progress of various tumor cells. Moreover, it is involved in the targetingregulation of multiple microRNAs and the activation/inhibition of multiplesignaling pathways. In this review, we presented a systematic summary of thepotential carcinogenicity and clinical value of CRNDE in the current evidence, soas to provide reference for early diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and targetedtherapy of various clinical cancers.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S162754 PMCID: PMC6029599PMID: 29988699
