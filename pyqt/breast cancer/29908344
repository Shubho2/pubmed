Since oxidative stress has been implicated as being pivotal in various cancers, antioxidant therapy seems an apt strategy to abrogate ROS-mediatedcellular processes to attenuate cancers. We therefore synthesized ROS scavenging nitroxide radical-containing nanoparticles (RNPs); pH insensitive RNPO and pHsensitive RNPN, to impede the proliferative and metastatic characteristics of thetriple negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, both in vitro and in vivo.RNPs significantly curtailed the proliferative and clonogenic potential ofMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines. Inhibition of ROS-mediated migratory andinvasive characteristics of MDA-MB-231, via down regulation of NF-κB and MMP-2,was also confirmed. Furthermore, a significant anti-tumor and anti-metastaticpotential of RNPs was observed in an MDA-MB-231 mouse xenograft model. Suchtumoricidal effects of RNPs were attained with negligible adverse effects,compared to conventional low molecular weight antioxidants, TEMPOL. Thus, thetumoricidal effects of RNPs are suggestive of insights on precedence ofnanoparticle-based therapeutics over current low molecular weight antioxidants tocurtail ROS-induced tumorigenesis of various cancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
