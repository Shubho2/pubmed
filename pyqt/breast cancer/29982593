[Epub ahead of print]Black-White Breast Cancer Incidence Trends: Effects of Ethnicity.Davis Lynn BC(1), Rosenberg PS(1), Anderson WF(1), Gierach GL(1).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute,Bethesda, MD.Recent reports of converging black and white breast cancer incidence rates havegained much attention, potentially foreshadowing a worsening of the black-whitebreast cancer mortality disparity. However, these incidence rates also reflectthe sum of non-Hispanics and Hispanics that may mask important ethnicity-specifictrends. We therefore assessed race- and ethnicity-specific breast cancer trendsusing the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results(SEER) 13 Registries Database (1992-2014). Age-period-cohort models projectedrates for 2015-2030. Results confirmed merging of age-standardized incidencerates for blacks and whites circa 2012, but not for non-Hispanic black (NHB) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Incidence rates were highest for NHW women (n =382 290), followed by NHB women (n = 51 074), and then Hispanic white women (n = 48 651). The sample size for Hispanic blacks was too small for analysis (n =693). Notably, future incidence rates are expected to slowly increase (2015through 2030) among NHW women (0.24% per year, 95% confidence interval [CI] =0.17 to 0.32) and slowly decrease for NHB women (-0.14% per year, 95% CI = -0.15 to -0.13). A putative worsening of the black-white mortality disparity,therefore, seems unlikely. Ethnicity matters when assessing race-specific breast cancer incidence rates.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy112 PMID: 29982593
