Electronic address:zoufei616@163.com.Lung metastasis is a primary obstacle in the clinical treatment of metastaticbreast cancer. Most patients with lung metastasis eventually die of recurrence.Recurrence may be related to self-seeding, which occurs when circulating tumorcells re-seed into the tumors they originated from (metastasis or carcinoma insitu). Tumor-derived exosomes have been intensively revealed to promote theprogression of various cancers. However, whether tumor-derived exosomes playroles in tumor self-seeding has not yet been identified. By establishing aself-seeding nude mouse model, we found that exosomes derived from MDA231-LM2cells (subpopulations of breast cancer lung metastasis) potentiate the growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts. More importantly, laser confocal microscopy and flowcytometry results identified that MDA231-LM2-secreted exosomes promote theseeding of MDA231-LM2 cells into MDA-MB-231 xenografts. These findings suggestMDA231-LM2-secreted exosomes as a promising target to treat breast cancer lungmetastasis.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
