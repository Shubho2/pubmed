Here, we describe the development of a one-step branchedrolling circle amplification (BRCA) method to measure serum c-miRNAs levels forearly diagnosis of breast cancer. Four c-miRNAs, c-miRNA16 (c-miR-16), c-miRNA21 (c-miR-21), c-miRNA155 (c-miR-155), and c-miRNA195 (c-miR-195) were isolated fromthe serum of 49 breast cancer patients (stages I-IV) and 19 healthy controls, andanalyzed using one-step BRCA. The serum levels of c-miR16, c-miR21, c-miR155, andc-miR195 were higher (P < 0.0001) in stage I breast cancer patients than healthy controls. These levels were also higher in several breast cancer molecularsubtypes (HER-2 over-expression, Luminal A, Luminal B, and triple negative breastcancer) than in healthy control subjects. The diagnostic accuracy of c-miR16,c-miR21, c-miR155, and c-miR195 for early diagnosis of breast cancer wasconfirmed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assay. These resultsshow that the BRCA method can be used to measure serum c-miRNAs levels, and that this method has high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Moreover, both BRCA approach and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method show that the serumlevels of c-miR16, c-miR21, c-miR155, and c-miR195 could be used as biomarkers toimprove the early diagnosis of breast cancer, and distinguish different breastcancer molecular subtypes.
