Therefore, the availability ofrelevant culture models that can be manipulated and that retain the epigeneticfeatures of the tissue of origin is absolutely crucial for studying theepigenetic mechanisms underlying cancer and testing epigenetic drugs. In thisstudy, we took advantage of quantitative mass spectrometry to comprehensivelyprofile histone PTMs in patient tumor tissues, primary cultures and cell linesfrom three representative tumor models, breast cancer, glioblastoma and ovariancancer, revealing an extensive and systematic rewiring of histone marks in cellculture conditions, which includes a decrease of H3K27me2/me3, H3K79me1/me2 andH3K9ac/K14ac, and an increase of H3K36me1/me2. While some changes occur inshort-term primary cultures, most of them are instead time-dependent and appearonly in long-term cultures. Remarkably, such changes mostly revert in cell line- and primary cell-derived in vivo xenograft models. Taken together, these results support the use of xenografts as the most representative models of in vivoepigenetic processes, suggesting caution when using cultured cells, in particularcell lines and long-term primary cultures, for epigenetic investigations.DOI: 10.1093/nar/gky224 PMCID: PMC5934616PMID: 29618087
