Asestrogen receptor (ER) status of primary lesion was positive, the patient alsoreceived F-fluoroestradiol (F-FES) PET/CT. Unlike primary lesion, no remarkableF-FES uptakes in the lymph nodes were observed. F-FDG uptakes in the nodes werefinally interpreted as inflammation. F-FES PET that can noninvasively evaluatethe ER status may have a potential to reveal the pathology of the false-positive lesion observed in F-FDG PET for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.1097/RLU.0000000000002041 PMID: 29485433
