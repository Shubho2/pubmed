MicroRNAs have been proven to act as an indispensable role in thereuse of multiple solid tumours. Although miR-1258 plays a vital role insuppressing metastasis in breast cancer and gastric cancer, the specificbiological function of miR-1258 in non-small-cell lung cancer remains unclear.METHODS: The differential expression of miR-1258 in NSCLC tissues andcorresponding paracancerous tissues was detected by qRT-PCR and ISH. Flowcytometry and CCK-8, EdU, tubule formation, and senescence assays were performed,and xenograft models were studied to explore the function of miR-1258. Potential targets of miR-1258 were verified by dual luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, IHCand Western blotting.RESULTS: In vitro and in vivo gain- and loss-of-function assays suggested thatmiR-1258 inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and induces senescence and apoptosis. The luciferase reporter assay, IHC and Western blotting analysis showed that GRB2is one of the direct targets of miR-1258. The GRB2 overexpression plasmid canreverse the functional changes after overexpression of miR-1258. In contrast,miR-1258 inhibitor significantly reversed si-GRB2-induced GRB2 down-regulation.Mechanistically, overexpression of miR-1258 inhibits GRB2 expression and thenleads to inactivation of the Ras/Erk oncogenic pathway.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that miR-1258 can suppress NSCLC progression bytargeting the GRB2/Ras/Erk pathway, which may lead to different insights intopotential biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies for NSCLC patients.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/cpr.12502 PMID: 30069987
