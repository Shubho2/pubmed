BC in Saudi women tend to behave more aggressively than breastcancer in the West. Therefore, identification of new molecular targets andtreatment strategies are highly warranted to improve patient outcome. FoxM1 hasbeen shown to play a critical role in pathogenesis of various malignancies. Inthis study, we explored the prevalence and clinical implication of FoxM1overexpression in Saudi breast cancer. FoxM1 protein overexpression was seen in79% (770/975) of BC tissues and was associated with aggressive clinicalparameters such as younger age (< 30 yrs) (p = 0.0172), high grade (p < 0.0001), mucinous histology (p < 0.0001) and triple negative phenotype (p < 0.0001).Overexpression of FoxM1 was significantly associated with activated AKT (p <0.0001), Ki67 expression (p < 0.0001), VEGF (p < 0.0001), MMP-9 (p < 0.0001),XIAP (p < 0.0001) and Bcl-xL (p = 0.0300). Importantly, FoxM1 overexpression isfound to be an independent prognostic marker in multivariate analysis in advancedstage (Stage III and IV) breast cancer (p = 0.0298). In vitro data using BC cell lines showed that down-regulation of FoxM1 using specific inhibitor, thiostreptonor siRNA inhibited cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis. In addition,treatment of BC cell lines with thiostrepton resulted in inhibition ofproliferation and induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo,thiostrepton treatment regressed MDA-MB-231 cells generated xenografts viadown-regulation of FoxM1 and its downstream targets. Our results suggest thatFoxM1 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of aggressivebreast cancers.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24739 PMCID: PMC5915129PMID: 29707121
