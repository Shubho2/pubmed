However, the scientific literature has notestablished whether myofascial trigger points of differing etiologies have thesame clinical characteristics. Thus, the objective of the present study was tocompare the intensity of myofascial pain, catastrophizing, and the pressure pain threshold at myofascial trigger points among breast cancer survivors and womenwith neck pain. This was a cross-sectional study that included women over 18years old complaining of myofascial pain in the upper trapezius muscle region formore than 90 days, equally divided into breast cancer survivors (n = 30) andthose with neck pain (n = 30). For inclusion, the presence of a bilateral,active, and centrally located trigger point with mean distance from C7 toacromion in the upper trapezius was mandatory. The measures of assessment were:pain intensity, catastrophizing, and the pressure pain threshold at themyofascial trigger points. A significant difference was observed only whencomparing pain intensity (p < 0.001) between the breast cancer survivors (median score: 8.00 points, first quartile: 7.00 points, third quartile: 8.75 points) andwomen with neck pain (median score: 2.50 points, first quartile: 2.00 points,third quartile: 4.00 points). No significant difference was found between groups in catastrophizing and pressure pain threshold. The conclusion of this study was that breast cancer survivors have a higher intensity of myofascial pain in theupper trapezius muscle when compared to patients with neck pain, which indicates the need for evaluation and a specific intervention for the myofascialdysfunction of these women.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
