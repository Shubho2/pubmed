We aimed to estimate, for each trial, thestatistical power to demonstrate a significant gain in overall survival (OS).Power was calculated with Freedman's formula. Given the allocation ratio and the number of events, power was computed as a function of hazard ratio. We focused onfour specific hazard ratio values (0.94, 0.89, 0.81, and 0.77), which areestimated to correspond to absolute 3, 6, 12, and 15 months gain in OS,respectively. For these calculations, the type I error rate was stated at 5% witha two-sided test, and we assumed that the risk of death was constant over time.PALOMA-2 and MONALEESA trials have an almost similar power despite differentallocation ratios, while MONARCH-3 has a more limited power. Overall, the powerof the four trials to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in OSis less than 70% if the prolongation in median OS is â‰¤12 months, whatever the OS data maturity. This analysis shows that OS results are jeopardized by limitedpowers, and a meta-analysis might be required to demonstrate OS benefit.Conversely, if a significant OS improvement is observed in some but not at alltrials, this discrepancy might be more attributable to chance than to a trulydifferent drug efficacy.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0068-4 PMCID: PMC6018749PMID: 29951582
