However, inactivation ofeIF4E does not impair translation of many capped mRNAs, suggesting an unknownalternate mechanism may exist for cap-dependent but eIF4E-independenttranslation. We show that DAP5, an eIF4GI homolog that lacks eIF4E binding,utilizes eIF3d to facilitate cap-dependent translation of approximately 20% ofmRNAs. Genome-wide transcriptomic and translatomic analyses indicate that DAP5 isrequired for translation of many transcription factors and receptor capped mRNAs and their mRNA targets involved in cell survival, motility, DNA repair andtranslation initiation, among other mRNAs. Mass spectrometry and crosslinkingstudies demonstrate that eIF3d is a direct binding partner of DAP5. In vitrotranslation and ribosome complex studies demonstrate that DAP5 and eIF3d are bothessential for eIF4E-independent capped-mRNA translation. These studies disclose awidespread and previously unknown mechanism for cap-dependent mRNA translation byDAP5-eIF3d complexes.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05539-0 PMCID: PMC6076257PMID: 30076308
