China.RATIONALE: Endocrine therapy plays an important role in the treatment of patientswith hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Renal metastasis of breast canceris rare in clinical practice.PATIENT CONCERNS: We present here a 54-year-old woman with breast cancer afterfirst line chemotherapy and second line endocrinotherapy (i.e., toremifene &exemestane) failure.DIAGNOSES: The patient was rarely diagnosed breast cancer metastasis to thekidney and a positive hormone status (ER and PR) but was negative for humanepidermal factor receptor 2 (HER2).INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with a high dose of fulvestrant (SERD; 500mg) by intramuscular injection once per month.OUTCOMES: The patient's condition significantly improved as measured by adecrease in the renal and pulmonary masses; symptoms including dry cough andblood phlegm also improved.LESSONS: Endocrinotherapy with high-dose fulvestrant may provide benefits forpatients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer with renal metastasis after SERMs failure.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011115 PMCID: PMC6023661PMID: 29901634  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
