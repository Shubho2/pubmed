A breastMRI is mainly used for women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, to help measure the size of the cancer, look for other tumors in the breast, and to checkfor tumors in the opposite breast. For certain women at high risk for breastcancer, a screening MRI is recommended along with a yearly mammogram. MRI isknown to give some false positive results which mean more test and/or biopsiesfor the patient. Thus, although breast MRI is useful for women at high risk, itis rarely recommended as a screening test for women at average risk of breastcancer. Also, breast MRI does not show calcium deposits, known asmicro-calcifications which can be a sign of breast cancer.DOI: 10.4103/sajc.sajc_104_18 PMCID: PMC5909298PMID: 29721466
