Hypermethylationmediated-silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) may contribute to breastcancer pathogenesis. The present study was conducted to investigate the promoter methylation status of BRCA1, DAPK1 and RASSF1A genes in Indian women with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Promoter methylation was evaluated in DNAextracted from mononuclear cells (MNCs) in peripheral blood samples of 60histopathologically confirmed newly diagnosed, untreated cases of breast canceras well as 60 age and sex matched healthy controls using MS-PCR. Association ofpromoter methylation with breast cancer-specific mortality was analyzed with Cox proportional hazards models. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed foroverall survival of the breast cancer patients. Results: We observed asignificant increase of BRCA1, DAPK1 and RASSF1A promoter methylation levels by51.7% (P <0.001), 55.0% (P <0.001) and 46.6% (P <0.001), respectively, whencompared to healthy controls. A strong correlation was noted betweenhypermethylation of the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 (P= 0.009), DAPK1 (P= 0.008)and RASSF1A (P= 0.02)) with early and advanced stages of breast cancer patients. We also found that breast cancer-specific mortality was significantly associated with promoter methylation of BRCA1 [HR and 95% CI: 3.25 (1.448-7.317)] and DAPK1 [HR and 95% CI: 2.32 (1.05-5.11)], whereas limited significant link was evidentwith RASSF1A [HR and 95% CI: 1.54 (0.697-3.413]. Conclusion: Our results suggest that promoter methylation of BRCA1, DAPK1 and RASSF1A genes may be associatedwith disease progression and poor overall survival of Indian women with breastcancer.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.2.443 PMCID: PMC5980932PMID: 29480000
