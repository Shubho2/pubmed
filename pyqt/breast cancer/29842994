Mitochondria contain their own circular genomic entity (mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA), up to even thousands of copies per cell. The mutation rate of mtDNA is several orders ofmagnitude higher than that of the nuclear DNA. Tumor-specific variants have been identified in tumors along the entire mtDNA, and their number varies among andwithin tumors. The high mtDNA copy number per cell and the high mtDNA mutationrate make it worthwhile to explore the potential of tumor-specific cf-mtDNAvariants as cancer marker in the blood of cancer patients. We usedsingle-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to profile the entire mtDNA of 19tissue specimens (primary tumor and/or metastatic sites, and tumor-adjacentnormal tissue) and 9 cfDNA samples, originating from 8 cancer patients (5 breast,3 colon). For each patient, tumor-specific mtDNA variants were detected andtraced in cfDNA by SMRT sequencing and/or digital PCR to explore theirfeasibility as cancer biomarker. As a reference, we measured otherblood-circulating biomarkers for these patients, including driver mutations innuclear-encoded cfDNA and cancer-antigen levels or circulating tumor cells. Four of the 24 (17%) tumor-specific mtDNA variants were detected in cfDNA, however at much lower allele frequencies compared to mutations in nuclear-encoded drivergenes in the same samples. Also, extensive heterogeneity was observed among theheteroplasmic mtDNA variants present in an individual. We conclude that there is limited value in tracing tumor-specific mtDNA variants in blood-circulating cfDNAwith the current methods available.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
