ER-positivity identifies the largestbreast cancer subgroup, and ER-directed therapies prolong survival and improvesymptoms in the advanced setting with a very favorable side effect profile.Treatment strategies have included decreasing estrogen synthesis and modulatingor degrading the ER. However, ER+ breast cancer once diagnosed in the advancedsetting still represents an incurable condition. Many efforts are ongoing tocircumvent resistance mechanisms with a few strategies already incorporated into clinical practice such as the combination of endocrine agents with drugs thatinterfere with other signaling pathways and cell-cycle progression. Importantquestions remain as how best to select each available strategy, how to sequencethem and ultimately how to extend benefits to the largest number of patients inneed.DOI: 10.21037/cco.2018.06.06 PMID: 30056727
