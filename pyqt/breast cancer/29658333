TheWorld Health Organization classification divides this type of tumour into threedifferent subtypes: mucinous carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma with tall columnarcells (mucinous cystadenocarcinoma and columnar cell mucinous carcinoma) andsignet ring cell carcinoma. A 74-year-old woman presented a tumour withinflammatory features in the upper outer quadrant of her left breast, 7 cm indiameter. The core biopsy showed infiltrating ductal carcinoma of no specifictype. The tumour-node-metastasis clinical staging was T4cN3M0 (Stage IIIC). Shereceived neoadjuvant chemotherapy, underwent left mastectomy with radicalaxillary resection and subsequently received radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Thehistological examination of the surgical specimen revealed two solid tumors inthe tail of Spence, which corresponded to adenocarcinoma with high columnarcells. The patient died 16 months after the diagnosis, suffering from pulmonarymetastases and anterior chest wall infiltration. A review of the literaturerevealed only 21 reports of mucinous carcinoma of the breast with tall columnarcells, including our case. This is only the third time that the specifichistological type of columnar cell mucinous carcinoma has been reported in theliterature.DOI: 10.1308/rcsann.2018.0060 PMCID: PMC5956608 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29658333  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
