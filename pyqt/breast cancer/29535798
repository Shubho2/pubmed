MCF-7 breast cancer cells chronically exposed toascorbate/menadione became resistant (Resox cells) by increasing mainly catalase activity. Since catalase appears as an anticancer target, the elucidation ofmechanisms regulating its expression is an important issue. In MCF-7 and Resoxcells, karyotype analysis showed that chromosome 11 is not altered compared tohealthy mammary epithelial cells. The genomic gain of catalase locus observed in MCF-7 and Resox cells cannot explain the differential catalase expression. Since ROS cause DNA lesions, the activation of DNA damage signaling pathways mayinfluence catalase expression. However, none of the related proteins (i.e., p53, ChK) was activated in Resox cells compared to MCF-7. The c-abl kinase may lead tocatalase protein degradation via posttranslational modifications, but neitherubiquitination nor phosphorylation of catalase was detected after catalaseimmunoprecipitation. Catalase mRNA levels did not decrease after actinomycin Dtreatment in both cell lines. DNMT inhibitor (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) increasedcatalase protein level in MCF-7 and its resistance to prooxidant drugs. In linewith our previous report, chromatin remodeling appears as the main regulator ofcatalase expression in breast cancer after chronic exposure to an oxidativestress.DOI: 10.1155/2018/5351967 PMCID: PMC5829333PMID: 29535798
