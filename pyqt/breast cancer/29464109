In May 2017, world governments made acommitment to further invest in cancer control as a public health priority,passing the World Health Assembly Resolution 70.12 on cancer prevention andcontrol within an integrated approach. In this manuscript, the 2016 EuropeanSociety for Medical Oncology Leadership Generation Programme participants proposea strategic framework that is in line with the 2017 WHO Cancer Resolution andconsistent with the principle of universal health coverage, which ensures access to optimal cancer care for all people because health is a basic human right. The time for action is now to reduce barriers and provide the highest possiblequality cancer care to everyone regardless of circumstance, precondition orgeographic location. The national actions and the policy recommendations in this paper set forth the vision of its authors for the future of global cancer controlat the national level, where the WHO Cancer Resolution must be implemented if we are to reduce the cancer burden, avoid unnecessary suffering and save as manylives as possible.DOI: 10.1136/esmoopen-2017-000285 PMCID: PMC5812392PMID: 29464109
