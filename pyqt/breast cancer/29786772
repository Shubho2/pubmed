Preoperative factors associated with upstaging to IDC included patient-reportedsigns and symptoms, a clinically palpable mass, ultrasound findings classified ascategory 4 or 5, the ultrasound appearance of a mass or widely distributednon-mass abnormality (NMA), and a high Ki67 index. The prevalence of SLNmacrometastasis was 0.9%. IDC was diagnosed for 10.9% of lesions of apreoperative ultrasound category of 0-3, 13.0% of those with no mass or NMAdetected by ultrasonography, and 14.1% of lesions preoperatively diagnosed bymethods other than core needle biopsy (CNB). Of those lesions, none wasassociated with SLN metastasis.CONCLUSIONS: Routinely performing SLN biopsy for patients undergoing mastectomyfor a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS is overtreatment, because the prevalence of SLN metastasis was low. SLN biopsy can be omitted for most patients. Inparticular, we suggest omitting SLN biopsy for patients who have lesions ofultrasound category 0-3, who have neither a mass nor NMA detected by ultrasound, or whose initial diagnosis was made based on a specimen obtained by methods otherthan CNB.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0871-7 PMID: 29786772
