[Epub ahead of print]Androgen blockade based clinical trials landscape in triple negative breastcancer.Shi Y(1), Yang F(1), Huang D(1), Guan X(2).Author information: (1)Department of Medical Oncology, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of NanjingUniversity, Nanjing 210002, China.(2)Department of Medical Oncology, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of NanjingUniversity, Nanjing 210002, China; Department of Medical Oncology, JinlingClinical College, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210002, China. Electronic address: xguan@nju.edu.cn.Androgen receptor (AR) targeted treatment has shown promising preliminary resultsin triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Identification of AR-associatedsignaling pathways is of great significance for in-depth understanding of theirroles in pathogenesis of TNBC. To meet this objective, preclinical and clinicalstudies were conducted to clarify the biological interactions of AR signaling andcombination strategies based on AR-targeted therapy. Biologically, AR signalingin TNBC which not only interacts with a network of key pathways, involvingPI3K/AKT/mTOR, cell cycle, and DNA damage repair pathways, but mediates pivotalprocesses of tumor initiation and immunogenic modulation, may present anopportunity to overcome the insensitivity of single AR-targeted therapy. Researchin investigating androgen-blockade based combination therapy in this aggressivetumor has demonstrated promising benefit in preclinical studies, and comparableclinical trials of combined strategies with CDK4/6 inhibitors, PI3K inhibition,chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, are ongoing. Accordingly, clinicalinterpretation of AR-related biological interactions, aiming at combined blockadeof the signaling pathways may pave a new way for endocrine-based therapy in thetreatment of TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
