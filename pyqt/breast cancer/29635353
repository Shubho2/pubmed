Some studies report that women with early menarche alsohave early menopause. Other studies report that women with early menarche havelate menopause, or they report no association. The duration of the reproductiveperiod may be an indicator of the cumulative endogenous exposure to estrogens andprogestogens during life course and is associated with risk of breast cancer and endometrial cancer.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective cohort study of 336 788 women, aged48-71 years, in the BreastScreen Norway during the years 2006-2014 was performed.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Information about age at menarche andmenopausal status was obtained by self-administered questionnaires. We used time to event approaches to estimate the associations.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Median age at menopause was 51 years in mostmenarche groups. Women with menarche at age 16 years or age ≥ 17 years hadmenopause 1 year later [median: 52 years, interquartile range (IQR): 49-54 years]than women with menarche at age 13 years (median: 51 years, IQR: 49-54 years,reference) (crude hazard ratio (HR) = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93-0.97 and 0.95; 95% CI:0.92-0.99, Pnon-linearity < 0.001). The reproductive period decreased withincreasing age at menarche (Pnon-linearity < 0.001), and women with menarche atage ≤ 9 years had 9 years longer median reproductive period than women withmenarche at age ≥ 17 years (median: 43 versus 34 years). Adjustment for year ofbirth did not change the HR estimates notably.LARGE SCALE DATA: Not applicable.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Information about age at menarche and age atmenopause was based on self-reports. Particularly for age at menarche, the longtime interval between the event and data collection may have caused imprecisereporting.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our study suggests that age at menarche is a strong indicator for the duration of women's reproductive period. Our findingsshould encourage studies of the independent role of duration of the reproductive period on the risk of breast cancer and endometrial cancer, since these cancershave been associated with exposure to estrogens and progestogens.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The present study was funded by theNorwegian Cancer Society [Grant number 6863294-2015].
