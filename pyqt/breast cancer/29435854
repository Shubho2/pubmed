In total, 3224 pT1-2N0-1 breast cancer patients who underwentmastectomy without PMRT were analyzed.RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 72.2 months (range 0.8-125.2 months). The overall CWRs during the follow-up period were 1.68% in N0 patients and 2.82% inN1 patients. There was no statistically significant difference in 5-year and10-year CWR-free survival (CWRFS) between the N0 and N1 patients. Of the 70patients with CWR, 33 (1% of all the patients) had isolated CWR, and the 10-year overall survival rate in this group was 96.9%. After the propensity scorematching of the N0 and N1 groups, there was still no difference in CWRFS by nodalstatus.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CWR in pT1-2N0-1 breast cancer patients is verylow, especially with isolated recurrence. Also, the obtained data showed that thenodal status had no impact on CWRFS.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4707-0 PMID: 29435854
