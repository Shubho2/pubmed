Their prognostic and predictive impact relatingto standard therapies is unclear.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether gDDRm status impacts benefit from establishedtherapies in mPC.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a retrospective, international,observational study. Medical records were reviewed for 390 mPC patients withknown gDDRm status. All 372 patients from Royal Marsden (UK), Weill-Cornell (NY),and University of Washington (WA) were previously included in a prevalence study (Pritchard, NEJM 2016); the remaining 18 were gBRCA1/2m carriers, from thekConFab consortium, Australia.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Response rate (RR),progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) data were collected.To account for potential differences between cohorts, a mixed-effect model(Weibull distribution) with random intercept per cohort was used.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The gDDRm status was known for all 390 patients (60carriers of gDDRm [gDDRm+], including 37 gBRCA2m, and 330 cases not found tocarry gDDRm [gDDRm-]); 74% and 69% were treated with docetaxel andabiraterone/enzalutamide, respectively, and 36% received PARP inhibitors (PARPi) and/or platinum. Median OS from castration resistance was similar among groups(3.2 vs 3.0 yr, p=0.73). Median docetaxel PFS for gDDRm+ (6.8 mo) was notsignificantly different from that for gDDRm- (5.1 mo), and RRs were similar(gDDRm+=61%; gDDRm-=54%). There were no significant differences in median PFS andRR on first-line abiraterone/enzalutamide (gDDRm+=8.3 mo, gDDRm-=8.3 mo;gDDRm+=46%, gDDRm-=56%). Interaction test for PARPi/platinum and gDDRm+ resulted in an OS adjusted hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% confidence interval 0.28-1.25;p=0.17). Results are limited by the retrospective nature of the analysis.CONCLUSIONS: mPC patients with gDDRm appeared to benefit from standard therapies similarly to the overall population; prospective studies are ongoing toinvestigate the impact of PARPi/platinum.PATIENT SUMMARY: Patients with inherited DNA repair mutations benefit fromstandard therapies similarly to other metastatic prostate cancer patients.Copyright Â© 2018 European Association of Urology.
