Here we provide evidence that specific microenvironments impose non-sporadic expression of proteins related to epithelial plasticity and drugresistance. Microarrays of robotically printed combinatorial microenvironments ofknown composition were used to make cell-based functional associations betweenmicroenvironments, which were design-inspired by normal and tumor-burdened breasttissues, and cell phenotypes. We hypothesized that specific combinations ofmicroenvironment constituents non-sporadically impose the induction of the AXLand cKIT receptor tyrosine kinase proteins, which are known to be involved inepithelial plasticity and drug-tolerance, in an isogenic human mammary epithelialcell (HMEC) malignant progression series. Dimension reduction analysis revealstype I collagen as a dominant feature, inducing expression of both markers inpre-stasis finite lifespan HMECs, and transformed non-malignant and malignantimmortal cell lines. Basement membrane-associated matrix proteins, laminin-111and type IV collagen, suppress AXL and cKIT expression in pre-stasis andnon-malignant cells. However, AXL and cKIT are not suppressed by laminin-111 inmalignant cells. General linear models identified key factors, osteopontin, IL-8,and type VIÎ±3 collagen, which significantly upregulated AXL and cKIT, as well as a plasticity-related gene expression program that is often observed in stem cellsand in epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition. These factors are co-located withAXL-expressing cells in situ in normal and breast cancer tissues, and associated with resistance to paclitaxel. A greater diversity of microenvironments inducedAXL and cKIT expression consistent with plasticity and drug-tolerant phenotypesin tumorigenic cells compared to normal or immortal cells, suggesting a reducedperception of microenvironment specificity in malignant cells.Microenvironment-imposed reprogramming could explain why resistant cells areseemingly persistent and rapidly adaptable to multiple classes of drugs. Theseresults support the notion that specific microenvironments drive drug-tolerantcellular phenotypes and suggest a novel interventional avenue for preventingacquired therapy resistance.DOI: 10.3389/fcell.2018.00041 PMCID: PMC5913284PMID: 29719832
