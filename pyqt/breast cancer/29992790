[Epub ahead of print]HOXA11 antisense long noncoding RNA (HOXA11-AS): A promising lncRNA in humancancers.Lu CW(1), Zhou DD(2), Xie T(3), Hao JL(1), Pant OP(1), Lu CB(4), Liu XF(1).Author information: (1)Department of Ophthalmology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin,China.(2)Department of Radiology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Jilin, China.(3)Department of Neurosurgery, The People's Hospital of Jilin Province, Jilin,China.(4)Department of Cardiology, The First Hospital of Jiamusi University,Heilongjiang, China.The cancers are the leading cause of disease-related deaths worldwide with a highrisk of morbidity and mortality. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a criticalrole in a wide range of biological processes, including tumorigenesis. HOXA11-AS (NCRNA00076), the antisense strands of HOXA11 gene, was initially revealed in amouse embryonic cDNA library in 2009 and it was a fairly novel lncRNA. Thisreview summarized the advanced research progression concerning the expression androle of HOXA11-AS in different human malignancies. The expression of HOXA11-AS isaberrantly altered in many cancers, either as a tumor suppressor or as a tumoraccelerator. The different underlying mechanism of HOXA11-AS in different cancers(including, nonsmall cell lung cancers, osteosarcoma, uveal melanoma, glioma,hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovariancancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and glioblastoma) was also detailed.These findings lead us to conclude that HOXA11-AS participate in the complexnetwork of cancers and plays an important role in the tumorigenesis andprogression. Functional HOXA11-AS could be a promising biomarker for earlydetection as well as prognosis evaluation in cancer patients. FutureHOXA11-AS-targeted intervention may become a valuable novel therapeutic tool,improving the clinical management of cancers.Â© 2018 The Authors.
