Epub 2018Feb 27.p63 isoforms in triple-negative breast cancer: ΔNp63 associates with the basalphenotype whereas TAp63 associates with androgen receptor, lack of BRCA mutation,PTEN and improved survival.Coates PJ(1), Nenutil R(2), Holcakova J(2), Nekulova M(2), Podhorec J(3), SvobodaM(3), Vojtesek B(4).Author information: (1)RECAMO, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Centre, Zluty kopec 7, 656 53, Brno, CzechRepublic. philip.coates@mou.cz.(2)RECAMO, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Centre, Zluty kopec 7, 656 53, Brno, CzechRepublic.(3)Department of Comprehensive Cancer Care, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute,Zluty kopec 7, 656 53, Brno, Czech Republic.(4)RECAMO, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Centre, Zluty kopec 7, 656 53, Brno, CzechRepublic. vojtesek@mou.cz.The TP63 gene encodes two major protein variants that differ in their N-terminal sequences and have opposing effects. In breast, ΔNp63 is expressed by immaturestem/progenitor cells and mature myoepithelial/basal cells and is acharacteristic feature of basal-like triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). The expression and potential role of TAp63 in the mammary gland and breast cancers isless clear, partly due to the lack of studies that employ p63 isoform-specificantibodies. We used immunohistochemistry with ΔNp63-specific or TAp63-specificmonoclonal antibodies to investigate p63 isoforms in 236 TNBCs. TAp63, but notΔNp63, was seen in tumour-associated lymphocytes and other stromal cells. Tumour cells showed nuclear staining for ΔNp63 in 17% of TNBCs compared to 7.3% thatwere positive for TAp63. Whilst most TAp63+ tumours also contained ΔNp63+ cells, the levels of the two isoforms were independent of each other. ΔNp63 associatedwith metaplastic and medullary cancers, and with a basal phenotype, whereas TAp63associated with androgen receptor, BRCA1/2 wild-type status and PTEN positivity. Despite the proposed effects of p63 on proliferation, Ki67 did not correlate witheither p63 isoform, nor did they associate with p53 mutation status. ΔNp63 showedno association with patient outcomes, whereas TAp63+ patients showed fewerrecurrences and improved overall survival. These findings indicate that bothmajor p63 protein isoforms are expressed in TNBCs with different tumourcharacteristics, indicating distinct functional activities of p63 variants inbreast cancer. Analysis of individual p63 isoforms provides additionalinformation into TNBC biology, with TAp63 expression indicating improvedprognosis.DOI: 10.1007/s00428-018-2324-2 PMID: 29484502  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
