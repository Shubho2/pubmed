We evaluated theinfluence of screening mammography on the extent of breast cancer treatment.METHODS: Patients ≥ 40 years of age diagnosed with breast cancer from September2008 to May 2016 at a single institution were divided into two groups: those withscreening 1-24 months prior to diagnosis, and those with screening at 25+ months,including patients with no prior mammography. The association between the twogroups and various clinical factors were assessed using logistic regressionmodels. Subgroup analysis was performed based on age groups.RESULTS: Analysis included 1125 patients, 819 (73%) with screening at 1-24months, and 306 (27%) with screening at 25+ months, including 65 (6%) who neverhad mammography. Overall, patients in the 25+ months group were more likely toreceive chemotherapy [odds ratio (OR) 1.51, p = 0.0040], undergo mastectomy (OR1.32, p = 0.0465), and require axillary dissection (AD; OR 1.66, p = 0.0045) thanthose in 1-24 months group. On subgroup analysis, patients aged 40-49 years with no prior mammography were more likely to have larger tumors (p = 0.0323) andpositive nodes (OR 4.52, p = 0.0058), undergo mastectomy (OR 3.44, p = 0.0068),undergo AD (OR 4.64, p = 0.0002), and require chemotherapy (OR 2.52, p = 0.0287) than the 1-24 months group.CONCLUSIONS: Screening mammography is associated with decreased stage atdiagnosis and receipt of less-extensive treatment. This was evident in allgroups, including the 40-49 years age group, where controversy exists on whether screening is even necessary.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6646-8 PMID: 29987612
