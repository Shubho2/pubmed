China.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are primary regulators of cancer development viatheir involvement in almost every aspect of cell biology. Recent studies haveindicated that lncRNAs serve pivotal roles in breast cancer (BC) progression;however, to the best of our knowledge, the role of the lncRNA BRAF-regulatedlncRNA 1 (BANCR) in BC has not yet been elucidated. The present study revealedthat BANCR was overexpressed in BC cell lines and tissues, and could promote the clinical progression of disease, including increases in tumor size, lymph nodemetastasis and Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage. Furthermore, high BANCR expressionwas demonstrated to be associated with poor overall survival rates and earlyrecurrence of BC in patients. Additionally, univariate and multivariate COXregression analyses identified high BANCR expression as an independent riskfactor of poor prognosis of patients with BC. In addition, to verify the functionof BANCR in BC cell lines, BANCR expression was silenced using short hairpin RNAsin MDA-MB-231 cells and overexpressed in MDA-MB-468 cells. An MTT assay andcolony formation assay indicated that BANCR knockdown could suppress theproliferation of BC cells, whereas BANCR upregulation induced the proliferationof BC cells. Furthermore, BANCR silencing also reduced the migration and invasionof BC cells, as demonstrated via transwell migration and invasion assays.Consistently, the migration and invasion of BC cells increased upon BANCR ectopicoverexpression in MDA-MB-468 cells. Mechanistically, matrix metallopeptidase 2/9 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers may be the potential targets ofBANCR in regulating BC metastasis. In conclusion, BANCR overexpression couldpromote the clinical progression, metastasis and proliferation of BC and indicatepoor prognosis of patients with BC. BANCR may therefore be a potential prognosticmarker and therapeutic target of patients with BC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8513 PMCID: PMC5958776PMID: 29805676
