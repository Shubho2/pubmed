In fact, there is an association between an increased BC risk andelevated estrogen levels, which may be involved in carcinogenesis via theestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) encoded by the ESR1 gene. Interestingly, there isan antagonistic relationship between ERα and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in BC cells.Aims: Herein, we explore the combined effects of the ESR1 (XbaI, PvuII) and AhRpolymorphisms on BC development in Mexican women according to their menopausalstatus.Settings and Design: Investigation was performed using a cases and controlsdesign.Subjects and Methods: In a group of 96 cases diagnosed with BC and 111 healthywomen, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms ESR1 (XbaI, PvuII) and AhR gene wereidentified by qPCR.Statistical Analysis Used: Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used.Statistical analyses were conducted using the STATA statistical package (Version 10.1, STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA).Results: The G/G XbaI genotype was more prevalent in the cases than in thecontrols (P = 0.008). Moreover, Mexican women carrying the XbaI (wild type [WT]/Gor G/G) ESR1 genotype have higher risk (12.26-fold) for developing postmenopausalBC than individuals carrying the WT/WT genotype.Conclusions: The presence of the G/G genotype of XbaI may be considered asusceptibility allele in Mexican women. Due to increased postmenopausal BC risk, the XbaI (WT/G or G/G) alleles may be used as a postmenopausal predictive factor for BC in Mexican women.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.179109 PMID: 29893332
