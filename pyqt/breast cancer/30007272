It still exposes women to associated morbidity.Risk models that use clinical and pathology information of the primary tumour to predict sentinel lymph-node metastasis may allow further improvements in care.This study assessed the performance of four published risk models for predicting sentinel lymph-node metastasis in Australian women with early breast cancer;including one model developed in an Australian population.METHODS: The Sentinel Node Biopsy Versus Axillary Clearance (SNAC) trial dataset was used to assess model discrimination by calculating the area under thereceiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) and the false-negative rate forsentinel lymph-node metastasis using model-predicted risk cut-points of 10%, 20%,30%, and calibration using Hosmer-Lemeshow tests and calibration plots.RESULTS: The sentinel node was positive in 248 of 982 (25.2%) women (158macrometastasis, 90 micrometastasis). The AUCs of risk models ranged from 0.70 to0.74 for prediction of any sentinel-node metastasis; 0.72 to 0.75 formacrometastasis. Calibration was poor for the three models developed outside ofAustralia (lack-of-fit statistics, P < 0.001). For women with a model-predictedrisk of sentinel lymph-node metastasis ≤10%, observed risk was 0-13% (threemodels <10%), false-negative rate 0-9%; 1-17% of women were classified in thisrange.CONCLUSION: All four models showed good discrimination for predicting sentinellymph-node metastasis, in particular for macrometastasis. With furtherdevelopment such risk models could have a role in the provision of reassurance tolow risk women with normal nodes sonographicaally for whom no axillary surgery iscontemplated.Copyright © 2018.
