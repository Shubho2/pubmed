Theoccurrence of de novo or acquired resistance to estrogen withdrawal represents animportant clinical problem, impacting on patient survival. In addition, despitean initially favorable outcome, a part of ER+ BC patients present with diseaserecurrence locally or at distant sites years or even decades after apparentremission. In vivo models that closely mimic human disease are urgently needed tostudy the biology of these tumors, investigate the molecular mechanismsunderlying endocrine resistance and identify patients at risk of recurrence.Despite the similarities in the overall hormonal regulation of mammary glanddevelopment between mice and humans, the majority of the mammary carcinomasoccurring in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are ER negative and mostxenograft models are based on few ER+ cancer cell lines. We recently showed that the microenvironment is critical for ER+ cancer cells and discuss in this review the potential of intraductal xenograft model for basic and preclinical research.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-18-0063 PMID: 29563191
