In such an immunoassay, immuno-Ag aggregatesare labeled with different Raman reporters to detect multiple breast cancerbiomarkers in real samples. Moreover, to better enhance the Raman signals,self-assembled silver nanoparticles are introduced on the bottom of themicrofluidic channels to obtain the SERS active immune-substrate. In order toavoid the crosstalk of SERS signals, we designed a spatially separated detection biosensor by using multi-channels in a microfluidic chip. In the experiments,CA153, CA125 and CEA are selected as the models of breast cancer biomarkers,which can be simultaneously detected of in human serum with an excellentlyspecificity and a high sensitivity. Furthermore, the proposed SERS microfluidicbiosensor can be applied to detect the biomarkers in real samples using a linear regression method for the statistical analysis. Our detection results are inagreement with those obtained using commercial ELISA kits, which proves thereliability of our SERS-based microfluidic immunoassay.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
