[Epub ahead of print]Evaluation of Simplified Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventing Healing Approach(S-LYMPHA) for the Prevention of Breast Cancer-Related Clinical Lymphedema After Axillary Lymph Node Dissection.Ozmen T(1), Lazaro M, Zhou Y, Vinyard A, Avisar E.Author information: (1)Department of Surgical Oncology, Miller School of Medicine, University ofMiami, Miami, FL.OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficiency of Simplified Lymphatic MicrosurgicalPreventing Healing Approach (S-LYMPHA) in preventing lymphedema (LE) in aprospective cohort of patients.BACKGROUND: LE is a serious complication of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)with an incidence rate of 25%. LYMPHA has been proposed as an effective adjunctto ALND for the prevention of LE. This procedure, however, requires microsurgicaltechniques and significant coordination between services.METHODS: All patients, undergoing ALND with or without S-LYMPHA between January2014 and December 2016 were included in the study. During follow-up visits,tape-measuring limb circumference method was used to detect LE. The incidence of LE was compared between ALND with and without S-LYMPHA.RESULTS: A total of 380 patients were included in the analysis. Median follow-up time was 15 (1-32) months. Patients, who underwent S-LYMPHA, had a significantly lower rate of LE both in univariate and multivariate analysis [3% vs 19%; P =0.001; odds ratio 0.12 (0.03-0.5)]. Excising more than 22 lymph nodes and aco-diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were also correlated with higher clinical LErates on univariate analysis, but only excising more than 22 lymph nodes remainedto be significant on multivariate analysis.CONCLUSIONS: S-LYMPHA is a simple method, which decreases incidence of LEdramatically. It should be considered as an adjunct procedure to ALND for allpatients during initial surgery.DOI: 10.1097/SLA.0000000000002827 PMID: 29794843
