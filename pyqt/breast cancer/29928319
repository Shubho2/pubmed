Epub 2018 Apr 2.Canine mammary tumors as a model for human disease.Abdelmegeed SM(1), Mohammed S(1).Author information: (1)Department of Comparative Pathobiology, Purdue University Center for CancerResearch, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.Animal models for examining human breast cancer (HBC) carcinogenesis have beenextensively studied and proposed. With the recent advent of immunotherapy,significant attention has been focused on the dog as a model for human cancer.Dogs develop mammary tumors and other cancer types spontaneously with an intactimmune system, which exhibit a number of clinical and molecular similarities toHBC. In addition to the spontaneous tumor presentation, the clinical similaritiesbetween human and canine mammary tumors (CMT) include the age at onset, hormonal etiology and course of the diseases. Furthermore, factors that affect the diseaseoutcome, including tumor size, stage and lymph node invasion, are similar in HBC and CMT. Similarly, the molecular characteristics of steroid receptor, epidermal growth factor, proliferation marker, metalloproteinase and cyclooxygenaseexpression, and the mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in CMT, mimic HBC. Furthermore, ductal carcinomas in situ in human and canine mammary glands areparticularly similar in their pathological, molecular and visual characteristics.These CMT characteristics and their similarities to HBC indicate that the dogcould be an excellent model for the study of human disease. These similaritiesare discussed in detail in the present review, and are compared with the in vitroand other in vivo animal models available.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8411 PMCID: PMC6004712PMID: 29928319
