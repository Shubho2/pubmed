Thisstudy investigated the relationship between routine clinicopathologicalindicators and ACR, and established a nomogram for predicting the probability of ACR in this subset of patients.Methods: Data for a total of 504 consecutive patients with intermediate RS fromJanuary 2014 to December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. A nomogram wasconstructed using a multivariate logistic regression model based on data from atraining set (378 cases) and validated in an independent validation set (126cases). A Youden-derived cut-off value was assigned to the nomogram for accuracy evaluation.Results: The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that age,histological grade, tumor size, lymph node (LN) status, molecular subtype, and RSwere independent predictors of ACR. A nomogram based on these predictorsperformed well. The P value of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for the prediction model was 0.286. The area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.905 [95% confidenceinterval (95% CI): 0.876-0.934] and 0.883 (95% CI: 0.824-0.942) in the trainingand validation sets, respectively. The accuracies of the nomogram for ACR were84.4% in the training set and 82.1% in the validation set.Conclusions: We developed a nomogram to predict the probability of ACR in breast cancer patients with intermediate RS. This model may aid the individual riskassessment and guide treatment decisions in clinical practice.DOI: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.02.05 PMCID: PMC5953958PMID: 29861607
