Epub2018 Mar 10.The influence of matrix stiffness on the behavior of brain metastatic breastcancer cells in a biomimetic hyaluronic acid hydrogel platform.Narkhede AA(1), Crenshaw JH(1), Manning RM(1), Rao SS(1).Author information: (1)Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.Breast cancer brain metastasis marks the most advanced stage of breast cancer no longer considered curable with a median survival period of ∼4-16 months. Apartfrom the genetic susceptibility (subtype) of breast tumors, brain metastasis isalso dictated by the biophysical/chemical interactions of tumor cells with nativebrain microenvironment, which remain obscure, primarily due to the lack oftunable biomimetic in vitro models. To address this need, we utilized abiomimetic hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel platform to elucidate the impact ofmatrix stiffness on the behavior of MDA-MB-231Br cells, a brain metastasizingvariant of the triple negative breast cancer line MDA-MB-231. We prepared HAhydrogels of varying stiffness (0.2-4.5 kPa) bracketing the brain relevantstiffness range to recapitulate the biophysical cues provided by brainextracellular matrix. In this system, we observed that the MDA-MB-231Br celladhesion, spreading, proliferation, and migration significantly increased withthe hydrogel stiffness. We also demonstrated that the stiffness based responsesof these cells were mediated, in part, through the focal adhesionkinase-phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathway. This biomimetic material system withtunable stiffness provides an ideal platform to further the understanding ofmechanoregulation associated with brain metastatic breast cancer cells. © 2018Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
