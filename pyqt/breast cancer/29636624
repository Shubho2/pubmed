Therefore, weconducted a meta-analysis to explore whether ITGB1 expression is correlated with overall survival (OS) and the clinicopathological characteristics of patientswith solid cancers. We systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web ofScience databases for eligible studies published up to June 1, 2017. In total, 22studies involving 3,666 patients were included. A sensitivity analysis wasperformed to assess the validity and reliability of the pooled OS. Among the 22studies, 7 focused on lung cancer, 3 focused on colorectal cancer, 6 focused onbreast cancer, 3 involved melanoma, and 3 involved pancreatic cancer. The pooled results showed that high ITGB1 expression was significantly associated with worseOS in lung cancer (pooled hazard ratio [HR]=1.78, 95% CI: 1.19-2.65, p<0.05) and breast cancer (pooled HR=1.88, 95% CI: 1.46-2.42, p<0.01). In addition, asignificant association was observed between high ITGB1 expression anddisease-free survival in breast cancer (pooled HR=1.63, 95% CI: 1.17-2.25,p<0.001) and pancreatic cancer (pooled HR=2.49, 95% CI: 1.35-4.61, p<0.001).However, high ITGB1 expression was not related to OS in colorectal cancer,pancreatic cancer, or melanoma. The pooled HRs used to evaluate the prognosticvalue of increased ITGB1 expression in lung cancer, breast cancer, and pancreaticcancer were not significantly altered, which indicates that the pooled resultswere robust. The results of this study indicate that the prognostic value ofdecreased ITGB1 expression varies among solid cancers.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S155279 PMCID: PMC5881529PMID: 29636624
