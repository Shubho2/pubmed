This open-label phase 1 clinical study evaluated safety,tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity of once-daily (QD) seviteronel in women with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC or ER+ breast cancer.METHODS: Seviteronel was administered in de-escalating 750, 600, and 450 mg QD6-subject cohorts. The 750 mg QD start dose was a phase 2 dose determined for menwith castration-resistant prostate cancer in (Shore et al. J Clin Oncol 34,2016). Enrollment at lower doses was initiated in the presence of dose-limitingtoxicities (DLTs). The primary objective of this study was to determineseviteronel safety, tolerability, and MTD. The secondary objectives includeddescription of its PK in women and its initial activity, including clinicalbenefit rate at 4 (CBR16) and 6 months (CBR24).RESULTS: Nineteen women were enrolled. A majority of adverse events (AEs) wereGrade (Gr) 1/2, independent of relationship; the most common were tremor (42%),nausea (42%), vomiting (37%), and fatigue (37%). Four Gr 3/4 AEs (anemia,delirium, mental status change, and confusional state) deemed possibly related toseviteronel occurred in four subjects. DLTs were observed at 750 mg (Gr 3confusional state with paranoia) and 600 mg (Gr 3 mental status change and Gr 3delirium) QD, with none at 450 mg QD. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was450 mg QD, and at the RP2D, 4 of 7 subjects reached at least CBR16 (2 TNBCsubjects and 2 ER+ subjects achieved CBR16 and CBR24, respectively); no objectivetumor responses were reported.CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily seviteronel was generally well tolerated in women withand 450 mg QD was chosen as the RP2D.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4813-z PMID: 29744674
