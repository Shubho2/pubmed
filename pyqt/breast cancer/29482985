Previous in vitro studies have reported that reduced expression of p27kip1 and p57kip2 is associated with resistance to taxane, which is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated theassociation of low p27kip1 and p57kip2 expression with outcomes in patients with breast cancer.METHODS: We investigated 226 cases of breast cancer from Kangbuk SMC between 2000and 2005. Levels of p27kip1 and p57kip2 expression were evaluated usingimmunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue microarray specimens. Therelationships between the expression levels of the markers and patients' outcomeswere analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model.RESULTS: Low p57kip2 expression was only associated with negative progesteronereceptor status (p = 0.034), whereas p27kip1 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.005). More detailed analysis revealed that low p27kip1 expression affects the overall survival rateof patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy including taxane (p = 0.026), but notthat of patients receiving chemotherapy without taxane.CONCLUSIONS: Low p27kip1 expression may be useful to predict overall survival in patients with breast cancer who are treated with taxane. Evaluation of p27kip1expression may provide further prognostic information beyond traditionalprognostic biomarkers and an understanding of the mechanisms that impartresistance against chemotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
