BPark2@jhmi.edu.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women and the second leadingcause of cancer-related death. There are many subtypes of breast cancer, whichcan be identified through the process of molecular and genetic profiling. Whilethe current standard of care utilizes tumor tissue biopsy to subclassify breastcancer, plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) can be detected through droplet digital PCR(ddPCR) of plasma obtained from a simple blood draw. Tissue biopsy is not onlymore invasive but because tumors exhibit heterogeneity it can be less accurate.Blood collects DNA shed from normal and cancerous cells alike, thus ddPCR ofplasma offers a broader picture of a cancer's genetic makeup. This chaptersummarizes how patients with breast cancer can be screened for specific cancerousmutations in both tissue and plasma through the use of ddPCR.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7778-9_13 PMID: 29717446
