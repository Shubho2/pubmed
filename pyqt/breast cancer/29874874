The range of the numerous negativeand/or positive emotions, thoughts, and behaviours depend on many psychologicalfactors such as psychological resilience. The authors are currently drawing areport on their own studies where they are trying to determine factors thatprotect body image resilience in women suffering from breast cancer aftermastectomies. The research group consisted of 120 women after a short (up to 2years) or a long (over 2 years) duration having elapsed since their mastectomy.The results of the research groups show that psychological resilience is asignificant protecting factor for the body image that prevents the excessivedevelopment of negative self-esteem in post-mastectomy women. Female patientsought to be provided aid in the short time immediately after the procedure andafterwards, when they are less capable of tolerating negative emotions. In order to significantly improve the general body image resilience to emotional andcognitive distortions in post-mastectomy women who experienced breast cancer, it is recommended that psychological interventions (from psychoeducation topsychological assistance and specialist psychotherapy) are conductedsystematically throughout the course of treatment.DOI: 10.3390/ijerph15061181 PMCID: PMC6025341PMID: 29874874
