Expression of synuclein-gamma (SNCG) has been associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. While reports on SNCG overexpression contributing tochemoresistance exist, limited information is available on the relationshipbetween SNCG and radioresistance of cancer cells. Here we investigated the roleof SNCG in radiation resistance in breast cancer cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of SNCG (siSNCG) markedly reduced SNCG protein level compared to scrambled siRNA (siScr) treatment. Furthermore, siSNCG treatment sensitized EstrogenReceptor-positive breast cancer cells (MCF7 and T47D) to ionizing radiation at 4 to 12 Gy as evidenced by the significant increase of apoptotic or senescent cellsand reduction in clonogenic cell survival in siSNCG treated cells compared tosiScr treated cells. On the other hand, we established an in vitro model of SNCG ectopic expression by using a triple-negative breast cancer cell line (SUM159PT) to further investigate the radioprotective effect of SNCG. We showed that ectopicexpression of SNCG significantly decreased apoptosis of SUM159PT cells andenhanced clonogenic cell survival after radiation treatment. At the molecularlevel, after irradiation, the p53 pathway was less activated when SNCG waspresent. Conversely, p21Waf1/Cip1 expression was upregulated in SNCG-expressingcells. When p21 was down-regulated by siRNA, radiosensitivity of SNCG-expressing SUM159PT cells was dramatically increased. This suggested a possible connectionbetween p21 and SNCG in radioresistance in these cells. In conclusion, our dataprovide for the first time experimental evidence for the role of SNCG in theradioresistance of breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25415 PMCID: PMC6007952PMID: 29937996
