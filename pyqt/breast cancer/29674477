Therefore, novel strategies to improve the efficacy of AATare warranted. Solid tumors such as breast cancer are characterized by a highinfiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), which are key drivers ofresistance to AAT. Therefore, we hypothesized that all-trans retinoic acid(ATRA), which induces differentiation of MDSC into mature cells, could improvethe therapeutic effect of AAT. ATRA increased the efficacy of anti-VEGFR2antibodies alone and in combination with chemotherapy in preclinical breastcancer models. ATRA reverted the anti-VEGFR2-induced accumulation of intratumoralMDSC, alleviated hypoxia, and counteracted the disorganization of tumormicrovessels. Mechanistic studies indicate that ATRA treatment blocked theAAT-induced expansion of MDSC secreting high levels of vessel-destabilizingS100A8. Thus, concomitant treatment with ATRA holds the potential to improve AAT in breast cancer and possibly other tumor types.Significance: Increasing thetherapeutic efficiency of antiangiogenic drugs by reducing resistance-conferring myeloid-derived suppressor cells might improve breast cancer treatment.Graphical Abstract:http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/12/3220/F1.large.jpg CancerRes; 78(12); 3220-32. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-3415 PMID: 29674477
