Then we advanced a novel 3S-paradigm of anticancer research thathelped to develop selection criteria and to estimate benefit/risk of localinterleukin-2 (IL-2) effects in this spontaneous mouse model. In this paper, the efficacy of single and triple local IL-2 doses is compared using properlyselected murine BLRB females based on our previously published data. Only BLRBfemales bearing spontaneous mammary tumors without subclinical period were used. The tumor growth rate and recipient survival of single and triple IL-2applications were compared with corresponding parameter values of untreatedcontrol. Tumor growth rate was decreased in both experimental groups versuscontrol parameter values. Single IL-2 application resulted in a significantprolongation of the average survival time while triple application caused acutetumor rejection in some females decreasing the survival time of the rest of therecipients. As a result, proper treatment protocol in accurately selected femalesallowed increasing the complete response rate to 14% in spontaneous mouse modelof breast cancer. In conclusion, our approaches may demonstrate the principlemethodology developing preselection procedure for breast cancer patients forlocal IL-2 therapy application.DOI: 10.1007/s12253-018-0396-6 PMID: 29511983
