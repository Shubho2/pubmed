Data indicate higher cure rates and longer times of survival in cancerpatients who regularly exercise.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the experiment. Animals at 1 month of age were intraperitoneally injected withN-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Three months following drug administration, ratsunderwent supervised physical training. The animals were divided into fourgroups: control untrained group and 3 groups trained with different intensities -i.e. low, moderate and high. Routine histopathological examination of tumors was performed and mitotic activity was assessed by immunohistochemical expression of the Ki-67 antigen.RESULTS: Ki-67 antigen expression was observed in all analyzed tumors. Theincrease in Ki-67 antigen expression correlated positively with the increase intraining intensity.CONCLUSION: It can be assumed that low-intensity physical training is safe forpatients with breast cancer. However, moderate- and high-intensity training mayinduce tumor cell proliferation worsening patients' prognosis.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11231 PMCID: PMC5905191PMID: 29475906
