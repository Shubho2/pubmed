Individual 30- to40-minute sessions of music therapy with the presence of a trained musictherapist were offered to participants.RESULTS: In this study, 164 women were randomized and 116 (63 CG and 53 MTG) wereincluded in the analyses, with mean age of 52.90 years (CG) and 51.85 years(MTG). Participants in the MTG had an average of 10 music therapy sessions,totaling 509 sessions throughout the study. FACT-F results were significantregarding Trial Outcome Index ( P = .011), FACT-G ( P = .005), and FACT-F ( P =.001) for the MTG compared with the CG.CONCLUSIONS: Individual music therapy sessions may be effective to reduce fatiguerelated to cancer and symptoms of depression, as well as to improve quality oflife for women with breast or gynecological cancer undergoing radiotherapy.Further well-designed research studies are needed to adequately determine theeffects of music therapy on fatigue.DOI: 10.1177/1534735418757349 PMID: 29633652
