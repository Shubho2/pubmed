We investigated the association between modest-durationtestosterone treatment and incident aggressive CaP.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective inception cohort study of male Veterans aged40 to 89 years with a laboratory-defined low testosterone measurement from 2002to 2011 and recent prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing; excluding those with recent testosterone treatment, prostate or breast cancer, high PSA or priorprostate biopsy. Histologically-confirmed incident aggressive prostate cancer or any prostate cancer were the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.RESULTS: Of the 147,593 men included, 58,617 were treated with testosterone. 313 aggressive CaPs were diagnosed, 190 among untreated men (incidence rate (IR) 0.57per 1000 person years, 95% CI 0.49-0.65) and 123 among treated men (IR 0.58 per1000 person years; 95% CI 0.48-0.69). After adjusting for age, race,hospitalization during year prior to cohort entry, geography, BMI, medicalcomorbidities, repeated testosterone and PSA testing, testosterone treatment was not associated with incident aggressive CaP (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.70-1.13) or anyCaP (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.81-1.01). No association between cumulative testosteronedose or formulation and CaP was observed.CONCLUSIONS: Among men with low testosterone levels and normal PSA, testosterone treatment was not associated with an increased risk of aggressive or any CaP. Theclinical risks and benefits of testosterone treatment can only be fully addressedby large, longer-term randomized controlled trials.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199194 PMCID: PMC6014638PMID: 29933385
