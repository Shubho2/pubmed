However, the association between its pre-diagnostic levels andcancer incidence has rarely been evaluated.METHODS: 8793 older adults from the German ESTHER cohort were followed up forcancer incidence by cancer registry data. A directed acyclic graph was utilizedto identify potential confounders. Multivariate Cox regression models wereapplied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).RESULTS: During 14-year follow-up, 1540 incident cancer cases, including 207lung, 196 colorectal, 218 breast and 245 prostate cancer cases were detected.8-isoprostane concentrations were positively associated with lung cancer, but notwith cancer at the other sites. The HR (95% CI) for the association with lungcancer was 1.61 (1.10, 2.34) for comparison of the top with bottom tertile intotal population. The association of 8-isoprostane levels with lung cancerpersisted after the adjustment for smoking and other potential confounders andwas multiplicative to the effect of smoking. However, 8-isoprostane levels didnot improve lung cancer prediction when added to a model containing age, sex and smoking. A protective association of increasing 8-isoprostane levels was observedfor prostate cancer incidence but this association was only statisticallysignificant among current smokers.DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that lipid peroxidation is involved in thedevelopment of lung cancer. However, high oxidative stress may be a protectivefactor for prostate cancer, especially among current smokers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
