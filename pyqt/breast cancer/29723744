Electronic address: vikasjaitak@gmail.com.In the present study, we have designed and synthesized indole derivatives bycoalescing the indole nucleus with chromene carbonitrile and dihydropyridinenucleus. Two compounds 5c and 6d were selected from series I and II aftersequential combinatorial library generation, docking, absorption, distribution,metabolism and excretion (ADME) filtering, anti-proliferative activity,cytotoxicity, and ER-α competitor assay kit by utilizing estrogen receptor-α(ER-α) dominant T47D BC cells line and PBMCs (Peripheral Blood MononuclearCells). Cell imaging experiment suggested that both the compounds successfullycross cellular biomembrane and accumulate in nuclear, cytoplasmic and plasmamembrane region. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting experiments furthersupported that both compounds reduced the expression of mRNA and receptor proteinof ER-α, thereby preventing downstream transactivation and signaling pathway inT47D cells line. Current findings imply that 5c and 6d represent novel ER-αantagonists and may be used in the development of chemotherapy for the managementof BC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
