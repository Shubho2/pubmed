Thismammography system can operate without an anti-scatter grid in place but usingsoftware scatter correction instead. This grid-less acquisition mode (PRIME)requires less patient dose due to the increase in primary radiation reaching the detector. This study retrospectively analyses data from the Region of SouthernDenmark where the grid-less mode has been installed in November 2013 and replacedgrid-based screening.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 72,188 screening cases from the samegeographical region in Denmark were included in the study. They were subdividedinto two study populations: cases acquired before and after installation of thegrid-less acquisition mode. Sensitivity and specificity of breast cancerscreening were calculated for the two populations; thus representing theperformance of grid-less and grid-based screening. To measure the entrancesurface air kerma (ESAK) additional phantom tests were carried out.Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) attenuation plates with different thicknesses(20-70 mm in steps of 10 mm) simulated the compressed breast (21 mm-90 mm) and a solid-state dosimeter was used.RESULTS: Statistical testing of the results showed that screening with grid-less acquisition provides equivalent performance with respect to sensitivity andspecificity compared to grid-based screening. The specificity was 98.11% (95%confidence interval (CI) from 97.93% to 98.29%) and 97.96% (95% CI from 97.84% to98.09%) for screening with grid-less acquisition and grid-based acquisition,respectively. The cancer detection rate as a measure for sensitivity was equal(0.55%) for grid-less screening and grid-based screening. An average glandulardose saving between 13.5% and 36.4% depending on breast thickness in grid-lessacquisition was obtained compared to grid-based acquisition.CONCLUSION: Statistically significant equivalence was shown with an equivalencemargin of 0.12% points for cancer detection rate and with an equivalence marginof 0.40% points for specificity. A marked patient dose savings in grid-lessacquisition of up to 36% compared to grid-based acquisition was achieved. It can be concluded that grid-less acquisition with software scatter correction is analternative to grid-based acquisition in mammography.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
