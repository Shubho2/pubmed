Theeffectiveness of postoperative radiotherapy and variables predicting the use ofradiotherapy were retrospectively analysed.RESULTS: After adjusting for age, tumour characteristics and therapies, Coxregression analysis for local recurrence-free survival identified RT as anindependent predictor for improved local control (HR: 0.579; 95%CI: 0.384-0.872, p = 0.008). Ten-year cumulative incidence of in-breast recurrences was 20.0%following BCS, compared to 13.6% in patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy(p = 0.012). As an estimate for disease-specific survival, 10-year relativesurvival was 105.4% for patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy and 101.6% without radiotherapy. On multivariate analysis, postoperative radiotherapy wasnot associated with improved overall survival (HR 0.526; 95%CI: 0.263-1.052,p = 0.069). Over time, a significant increase of RT was registered: while 1998only 42.9% of patients received postoperative radiotherapy, the proportion roseto 91.2% in 2014. Women aged < 50 years (OR: 2.559, 95%CI: 1.416-4.625,p < 0.001) or with negative hormone receptor status (OR: 2.625, 95%CI:1.458-4.728, p = 0.001) or receiving endocrine therapy (OR: 1.762, 95%CI:1.060-2.927, p = 0.029) were more likely to receive postoperative radiotherapyafter BCS.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study provides insights regarding the adoptionand treatment pattern of postoperative RT following BCS for DCIS in a largecohort reflecting "real-life" clinical practice in this setting. Postoperative RTwas found to be associated with a reduced risk of ipsilateral recurrence and nosurvival benefit compared to observation alone.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-0964-7 PMCID: PMC5807793PMID: 29426355
