Development of CBCs, guideline-adherent systemic therapyand surgical management should now show an impact on outcomes. This analysisaimed to investigate whether guideline adherence (GA) rates, relapse-freesurvival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) have significantly improved at CBCscompared to the pre-certification period.MATERIALS AND METHODS: 8323 patients with primary breast cancer were treated in17 German CBCs, which had been certified between 2003 and 2007 [2003 (n = 1),2004 (n = 6), 2005 (n = 3), 2006 (n = 6) and 2007 (n = 1)]. 3544 patients (42.6%)were treated before certification and 4779 patients (57.4%) after certification.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A highly significant (p < 0.001) difference in 100%-GAwas found between the various hospitals before certification (min 25.0%; max54.6%). In 2008, when all participating hospitals were certified, the GA rate was61.8% (min 39.5%, max 74.4%) and 69.2% (min 45.9%, max 86.4%) for patients <75 y (n = 6675). The difference between pre-certification 100%-GA (46.9%) andpost-certification (57.2%) was highly significant (p < 0.001). RFS and OS wereboth significantly better after certification compared to the pre-certificationperiod (RFS: HR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.68-0.92; p = 0.003; OS: HR = 0.75; 95% CI:0.65-0.85; p < 0.001). 5-year RFS (OS) of patients <75 y was 89.6% (85.4%)pre-certification and 91.4% (89.5%) post-certification. Since improvement in GAand outcomes correlated as well, GA remains a highly significant prognosticfactor for RFS and OS regardless of NPI, intrinsic subtype and adjuvant systemic therapy. This suggests that the certification process is strongly associated withimprovements in outcome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.breast.2018.04.002 PMID: 29698925
