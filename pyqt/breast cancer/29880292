Wecompared the clinical safety and efficacy of ABP 980 with that of trastuzumab in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer.METHODS: We did a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlledequivalence trial at 97 study centres in 20 countries, mainly in Europe and SouthAmerica. Eligible women were aged 18 years or older, had histologically confirmedHER2-positive invasive early breast cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Groupperformance status score of 0 or 1, and were planning to have surgical resection of the breast tumour with sentinel or axillary lymph node dissection andneoadjuvant chemotherapy. After four cycles of run-in anthracycline-basedchemotherapy, patients were assigned 1:1 to receive ABP 980 or trastuzumab with apermuted block design (blocks of four) computer-generated randomisation schedule.Patients received neoadjuvant therapy with a loading dose (8 mg/kg) of ABP 980 ortrastuzumab plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 in a 90 min intravenous infusion, followed by three cycles of 6 mg/kg intravenous ABP 980 or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel 175mg/m2 every 3 weeks in 30 min intravenous infusions (or 80 mg/m2 paclitaxel once per week for 12 cycles if that was the local standard of care). Randomisation wasstratified by T stage, node status, hormone receptor status, planned paclitaxeldosing schedule, and geographical region. Surgery was completed 3-7 weeks afterthe last dose of neoadjuvant treatment, after which adjuvant treatment with ABP980 or trastuzumab was given every 3 weeks for up to 1 year after the first dose in the study. Patients had been randomly assigned at baseline to continue APB980, continue trastuzumab, or switch from trastuzumab to APB 980 as theiradjuvant treatment. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were risk difference andrisk ratio (RR) of pathological complete response in breast tissue and axillarylymph nodes assessed at a local laboratory in all patients who were randomlyassigned and received any amount of neoadjuvant investigational product andunderwent surgery. We assessed safety in all patients who were randomly assigned and received any amount of investigational product. This trial is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01901146 and Eudra, number CT 2012-004319-29.FINDINGS: Of 827 patients enrolled, 725 were randomly assigned to receive ABP 980(n=364) or trastuzumab (n=361). The primary endpoint was assessable in 696patients (358 who received ABP 980 and 338 who received trastuzumab).Pathological complete response was recorded in 172 (48%, 95% CI 43-53) of 358patients in the ABP 980 group and 137 (41%, 35-46) of 338 in the trastuzumabgroup (risk difference 7·3%, 90% CI 1·2-13·4; RR 1·188, 90% CI 1·033-1·366), withthe upper bounds of the CIs exceeding the predefined equivalence margins of 13%and 1·318, respectively. Pathological complete response in the central laboratoryassessment was seen in 162 (48%) of 339 patients assigned to ABP 980 at baseline and 138 (42%) of 330 assigned to trastuzumab at baseline (risk difference 5·8%,90% CI -0·5 to 12·0, and RR 1·142, 90% CI 0·993 to 1·312). Grade 3 or worseadverse events during the neoadjuvant phase occurred in 54 (15%) of 364 patients in the ABP 980 group and 51 (14%) of 361 patients in the trastuzumab group, ofwhich the most frequent grade 3 or worse event of interest was neutropenia,occurring in 21 (6%) patients in both groups. In the adjuvant phase, grade 3 orworse adverse events occurred in 30 (9%) of 349 patients continuing ABP 980, 11(6%) of 171 continuing trastuzumab, and 13 (8%) of 171 who switched fromtrastuzumab to ABP 980, the most frequent grade 3 or worse events of interestwere infections and infestations (four [1%], two [1%], and two [1%]), neutropenia(three [1%], two [1%], and one [1%]), and infusion reactions (two [1%], two [1%],and three [2%]). Two patients died from adverse events judged to be unrelated to the investigational products: one died from pneumonia while receiving neoadjuvantABP 980 and one died from septic shock while receiving adjuvant ABP 980 aftertrastuzumab.INTERPRETATION: Although the lower bounds of the 90% CIs for RR and riskdifference showed non-inferiority, the upper bounds exceeded the predefinedequivalence margins when based on local laboratory review of tumour samples,meaning that non-superiority was non-conclusive. In our sensitivity analysesbased on central laboratory evaluation of tumour samples, estimates for the twodrugs were contained within the predefined equivalence margins, indicatingsimilar efficacy. ABP 980 and trastuzumab had similar safety outcomes in both theneoadjuvant and adjuvant phases of the study.FUNDING: Amgen.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
