Paradoxically, thesevesicles have been reported to also possess fibrinolytic activity. To determinewhether thrombotic or fibrinolytic activity is a predominant characteristic ofthese extracellular vesicles, we prepared exosomes and MVs from 2 breast cancercell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF7), a lung cancer cell line (A549), and a leukemia cell line (NB4) and assayed their thrombotic and fibrinolytic activities. Weobserved that thrombotic activity was a common feature of MVs but not exosomes.Exosomes and/or MVs from several cell lines, with the exception of the A549 cell line, displayed fibrinolytic activity toward a pure fibrin clot, but onlyexosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells could degrade a fibrin clot formed in plasma.Increasing the malignant potential of MCF7 cells decreased the thromboticactivity of their MVs but did not alter their fibrinolytic activity. Decreasingthe malignant potential of NB4 cells did not alter the thrombotic or fibrinolyticactivity of their MVs or exosomes. Finally, the incubation of MDA-MB-231cell-derived exosomes with A549 cells increased plasmin generation by thesecells. Our data indicate that MVs generally have thrombotic activity, whereasthrombotic activity is not commonly observed for exosomes. Furthermore, exosomes and MVs generally do not display fibrinolytic activity under physiologicalconditions.Â© 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.DOI: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017015479 PMCID: PMC5965050PMID: 29752284
