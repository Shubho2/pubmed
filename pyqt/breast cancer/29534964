Electronic address:qiao794661@126.com.Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the most aggressive type of thyroidmalignancies and resistant to chemotherapy. Little is known on the underlyingmechanisms of ATC resistance to chemotherapy. In our work, we identified that6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) is critically involved in the developmentof ATC resistance to doxorubicin. We found that 6PGD mRNA, protein and enzymeactivity levels are significantly upregulated in ATC cells during the prolongedexposure to doxorubicin in a time-dependent manner. 6PGD inhibition by geneticand pharmacological approaches significantly inhibits growth and survival of ATC cells that are highly resistant to doxorubicin. Consistently, 6PGD inhibitionalso sensitizes ATC cells to doxorubicin treatment. Of note, we observed thedecreased level of NADPH, NADH and enzymatic activity of sirtuin-1 in response to6PGD inhibition in doxorubicin-resistant ATC cells. Lactate level was alsoreduced by 6PGD inhibition. All these indicate that 6PGD inhibition disruptsmetabolic reprogramming in doxorubicin-resistant ATC cells. Our work demonstrates6PGD activation-mediated resistance in response to doxorubicin and provides analternative therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to chemotherapy for ATCtreatment. Our findings also highlight the importance of metabolic reprogramming in ATC chemoresistance.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
