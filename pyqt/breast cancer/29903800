Semistructured interviews, including two hypothetical scenarios illustrating benefits and harms of screening and overdetection, wereanalysed using inductive and deductive thematic approaches. An inferentialclustering technique was used to assess overall patterns in narrative content by sociodemographic characteristics, personal screening preferences or understandingof overdetection.SETTING: Houston/Galveston, Texas, USA.PARTICIPANTS: 59 English-speaking women aged 70 years and older with no priorhistory of breast cancer.RESULTS: Very few women were familiar with the concept of overdetection andovertreatment. After the scenarios were presented, half of the women stilldemonstrated a lack of understanding of the concept of overdetection. Many women expressed suspicion of the concept, equating it to rationing. Women who showedunderstanding of overdetection were more likely to express an intent todiscontinue screening, although 86% of the women stated that hearing aboutoverdetection did not influence their screening decision. Themes identified didnot differ by race/ethnicity, education, age or screening preferences.Differences were identified between women who understood overdetection and women who did not (r=0.23, p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Many older women did not understand the concept of overdetection, inaddition to being suspicious of or resistant to the concept. Providing olderwomen with descriptions of overdetection may not be sufficient to influencescreening intentions.Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
