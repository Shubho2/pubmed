For high risk patients where IMNtreatment is warranted, there is limited data with regards to the degree of heartsparing conferred by modern techniques. In this study, we sought to analyze thespecific heart sparing metrics conferred by deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH)in the setting of IMN irradiation.METHODS: From 2012 to 2015, 168 consecutive patients were treated with adjuvantleft-sided radiotherapy using DIBH. Retrospective review identified 49 patientswho received nodal irradiation, either to a supraclavicular field (SCF) and IMN(16), or to the SCF alone (33). Cardiac mean dose and dose volumes werecalculated from free breathing (FB) and DIBH treatment plans, and compared byWilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-Whitney U tests.RESULTS: DIBH achieved significant reductions in mean heart dose (p < 0.001) inboth the IMN treated group from 6.73 Gy to 2.79 Gy (- 56.4%) and the IMNuntreated group from 4.77 Gy to 1.55 Gy (- 63.7%). There was a 7.3% difference inrelative reduction that was not statistically significant (p = 0.216). Relativereductions in heart dose volume measures were all significantly lower forIMN-irradiated patients (p ≤ 0.012), with the greatest deficits at V5 thatgradually diminish with increasing dose (V25).CONCLUSIONS: The relative heart sparing benefits of the DIBH technique areretained even with IMN inclusion. However, the addition of IMN irradiation isassociated with an intrinsically greater heart dose, which translates to anestimated 9.2% proportional increase in the risk of a subsequent major coronaryevent. In the setting of effective cardiac sparing techniques, clinicians should take these considerations into account to guide when IMN treatment is warranted.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-1052-8 PMCID: PMC5984301PMID: 29855325
