[Epub ahead of print]Aromatase Acetylation Patterns and Altered Activity in Response to SirtuinInhibition.Molehin D(1), Castro-Piedras I(2), Sharma M(1), R Sennoune S(3), Arena D(1),Manna PR(1), Pruitt K(4).Author information: (1)Immunology & Molecular Microbiology, TTUHSC.(2)Fisioloxia, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela.(3)Department of Cell Physiology and Molecular Biophysics, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, TX.(4)Immunology & Molecular Microbiology, TTUHSC kevin.pruitt@ttuhsc.edu.Aromatase, a cytochrome P450 member, is a key enzyme involved in estrogenbiosynthesis and is dysregulated in the majority of breast cancers. Studies have shown that lysine deacetylase inhibitors (KDI) decrease aromatase expression incancer cells, yet many unknowns remain regarding the mechanism by which thisoccurs. While advances have been made to clarify factors involved in thetranscriptional regulation of the aromatase gene (CYP19A1). Yet, despitearomatase being a primary target for breast cancer therapy, itspost-translational regulation has been virtually unexplored. Acetylation is apost-translational modification (PTM) known to alter the activity and stabilityof many oncoproteins and given the role of KDIs in regulating aromataseexpression, we postulate that aromatase acetylation acts as a novelpost-translational regulatory mechanism that impacts aromatase expression and/or activity in breast cancer. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS) analysis revealed that aromatase is basally acetylated on severallysine residues (108, 242, 262, 334, 352 and 354) in MCF-7 cells, and treatmentwith a SIRT-1 inhibitor induced additional acetylation (376, 390, 440 and 448).These acetylated lysine residues are in regions critical for aromatase activity. Site-directed mutagenesis and overexpression studies demonstrated that K108R/Q orK440R/Q mutations significantly altered aromatase activity in breast cancer cellswithout altering its subcellular localization.IMPLICATIONS: These findingsdemonstrate a novel post-translational regulation of aromatase and uncover novel anti-cancer effects of deacetylase inhibitors; thus, providing new insight forongoing development of deacetylase inhibitors as cancer therapeutics.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0047 PMID: 29921733
