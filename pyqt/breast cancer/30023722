Expression of c-MYC is regulated by the G-quadruplex structure formed in the G-rich segment of nuclease hypersensitive element (NHE III1), that is, "Pu27", which islocalized in the promoter region. Ligand-induced stabilization of the Pu27structure has been identified as a novel target for cancer therapeutics. Here, wehave explored the library of synthetic compounds against the predefined bindingsite of Pu27. Three compounds were selected based on the docking analyses; theywere further scrutinized using all atom molecular dynamics simulations in anexplicit water model. Simulated trajectories were scrutinized for conformational stability and ligand binding free energy estimation; essential dynamic behaviorwas determined using principal component analysis. One of the molecules, "TPP(1-(3-(4-(1,2,3-thiadiazol-4-yl)phenoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl)-4-carbamoylpiperidinium)", with the best results was considered for further evaluation. The theoretical observations are supported well by biophysical analysis using circular dichroism,isothermal titration calorimetry, and high-resolution NMR spectroscopy indicatingassociation of TPP with Pu27. The in vitro studies were then translated intoc-MYC overexpression in the T47D breast cancer cell line. Biological evaluationthrough the MTT assay, flow cytometric assay, RT-PCR, and reporter luciferaseassay suggests that TPP downregulates the expression of c-MYC oncogene byarresting its promoter region. In silico and in vitro observations cumulativelysuggest that the novel skeleton of TPP could be a potential anticancer agent bystabilizing the G-quadruplex formed in the Pu27 and consequently downregulatingthe expression of c-MYC oncogene. Derivation of new molecules on its skeleton mayconfer anticancer therapeutics for the next generation.DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.6b00531 PMCID: PMC6044917PMID: 30023722
