Conflict of interest statement: Tarleton received funding to cover the cost ofresearch supplies and exercise equipment from the Tower Cancer ResearchFoundation (Community Partner Grant) and from the QueensCare Foundation(Charitable Division). These funding sources did not provide salary support forthe principal investigator and other key personnel. Ricci, Flores, Kuroyama, and Asher declare that they have no conflicts of interest.128.

Secondarily, to evaluate outcomes and toxicity in aseries of 83 patients treated with this technique at our institution.Material and methods: Retrospective analysis of a series of patients treated withHDR-BT APBI after intraoperative multicatheter interstitial implant betweenNovember 2006 and June 2017 at our institution. We assessed cosmesis, toxicity,overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS).Results: Eighty-three patients were included: 59 patients (71.1%) with primaryearly-stage breast cancer and 24 (28.9%) with locally recurrent breast cancer.Tumorectomy was performed in all cases, with intraoperative tumor marginassessment and sentinel node biopsy. Median age was 82 years (range, 44-92). The total prescribed dose was 32 Gy (8 treatment fractions) in 60 patients (72.3%),and 34 Gy (10 fractions) in 23 patients (27.7%). Median follow-up was 40 months(range, 1-136 months). Three-year OS and DFS in the recurrent and primary cancer groups were 87% vs. 89%, and 96 % vs. 97.8%, respectively. Five patients diedfrom non-cancer related causes. No local relapses were observed. Rates of acuteand late toxicity were low in both groups. The cosmesis was good or excellent in most of patients treated for primary disease; in patients who underwent salvagebrachytherapy for local recurrence, cosmesis was good in 49 patients and fair in 6.Conclusions: This technique, although time-consuming, achieves good local diseasecontrol with a satisfactory toxicity profile in both early-stage and localrecurrent breast cancer patients. It may be especially suitable for frailpatients.DOI: 10.5114/jcb.2018.75594 PMCID: PMC5961524PMID: 29789758
