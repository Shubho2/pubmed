It is well known that anti-estrogen therapy (AET), especially aromatase inhibitors (AI), is associated with rapid bone loss and thus increases the risk of osteoporosis. Thisstudy characterizes patterns and predictors of receiving guideline-recommendedbone densitometry (BD) screening at AET initiation.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study (1998-2012) of all women ≥65 years of ageinitiating AET was designed using claims data from Quebec's universal healthcare. Associations with BD screening were estimated using a generalizedestimating equations regression model, adjusting for clustering of patientswithin physicians.RESULTS: Among 16,480 women initiating AET, 36.1% received a baseline BD. AmongAI users, the rate was 58.4%. In the multivariate analysis, age, lowersocioeconomic status, tamoxifen use, lack of periodic health exam and having ageneral practitioner as the AET prescriber were associated with lower odds of BD screening. In terms of quality of care-related variables, lack ofguideline-appropriate radiotherapy (OR: 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57-0.83), or chemotherapyconsideration (0.82 (95% CI, 0.71-0.94)) and non-adherence to AET (0.76 (95% CI, 0.68-0.84)) were associated with lower odds of receiving BD screening. Womendiagnosed with BC after 2003 had significantly better odds of being screened.CONCLUSION: Despite an increase in rates since 2003, BD screening remainssuboptimal, especially for women at higher risk of osteoporosis. Coordination of health care and service-delivery monitoring can potentially optimize long-termmanagement of treatment-related toxicity in older BC survivors.Copyright © 2018.
