This study evaluated theeffectiveness of a combined smartwatch- and social media-based health educationintervention on BCS's health outcomes. Thirty BCS ( X ¯ age = 52.6 ± 9.3 years; X¯ Wt = 80.2 ± 19.6 kg) participated in this 10-week, 2-arm randomized trial, withBCS randomized into: (1) experimental group (n = 16): received Polar M400smartwatches for daily PA tracking and joined a Facebook group wherein SocialCognitive Theory-related PA tips were provided twice weekly; and (2) comparisongroup (n = 14): only joined separate, but content-identical Facebook group.Outcomes included PA, physiological, psychosocial, and QoL variables.Specifically, PA and energy expenditure (EE) was assessed by ActiGraph GT3X+accelerometers while physiological, psychosocial, and QoL were examined viavalidated instruments at baseline and post-intervention. No baseline groupdifferences were observed for any variable. Ten BCS dropped out of the study(experimental: 4; comparison: 6). Compared to completers, dropouts differedsignificantly on several outcomes. Thus, a per-protocol analysis was performed,revealing significant group differences for changes in social support (t = -2.1, p = 0.05) and barriers (t = -2.2, p = 0.04). Interestingly, the comparison group demonstrated improvements for both variables while the intervention groupdemonstrated slightly decreased social support and no change in barriers.Notably, both groups demonstrated similarly increased daily light PA,moderate-to-vigorous PA, EE, and steps of 7.7 min, 5.1 min, 25.1 kcals, and 339steps, respectively, over time. Despite extensive user training, severalexperimental BCS found the Polar M400 use difficult-possibly decreasingintervention adherence. Future interventions should utilize simpler smartwatches to promote PA among middle-aged clinical/non-clinical populations.DOI: 10.3390/jcm7060140 PMCID: PMC6025572PMID: 29880779
