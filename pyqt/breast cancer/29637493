Since cytochrome P450Â (CYP) 2D6 isthe most important enzyme in the production of endoxifen, drugs that inhibitCYP2D6 would be expected to reduce tamoxifen efficacy. In addition to drug-druginteractions (DDI) involving CYP2D6, there is growing evidence that enzymeinducers can substantially alter the disposition of endoxifen, reducing tamoxifenefficacy. Although the clinical evidence on the impact of CYP2D6 inhibitors ontamoxifen efficacy is mixed, there were serious flaws in many of the studies.Thus, there is a reasonable chance that CYP2D6 inhibitors do in fact inhibittamoxifen efficacy. Tamoxifen has extraordinarily complex pharmacokinetics, with more than a dozen drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters involved in itsdisposition. Enzyme inducers may increase the activity of several of thesepathways, including phase II enzymes, ABC transporters, and various CYP enzymesother than CYP2D6. Based on current clinical evidence, one could argue thatenzyme inducers are potentially more dangerous than CYP2D6 inhibitors in patientstaking tamoxifen. Moreover, early evidence suggests that the combination ofCYP2D6 inhibitors plus enzyme inducers may produce catastrophic inhibition oftamoxifen efficacy. One could argue that, given the available evidence, anagnostic "wait and see" position on tamoxifen DDI is ethically untenable, andthat many women with breast cancer are currently being subjected to anunnecessary risk of cancer recurrence. Specific recommendations to reduce therisk of adverse tamoxifen DDI are offered for consideration.DOI: 10.1007/s13318-018-0475-9 PMID: 29637493
