Edwards School ofMedicine.Colon metastasis from breast cancer is rare. Gastrointestinal (GI) metastasis is more frequently seen in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breastcompared to invasive ductal carcinoma; however, the most common sites ofmetastasis still remain the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and bones. We describe a68-year-old female with a remote history of invasive ductal carcinoma of thebreast who presented with abdominal pain and a palpable mass. On imaging, she wasfound to have a colonic obstruction and underwent a right hemicolectomy thatproved to be metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2588 PMCID: PMC6037340PMID: 30009102
