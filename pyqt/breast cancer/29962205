This scaffold maydetermine preferential rotational isomers to selectively interact within thetumor-associated CAs. Most of the compounds indeed showed in vitro selectiveinhibition of the tumor associated CA isoforms IX and XII. The most potentderivative within the series was 11 ( KIs of 2.59 and 7.64 nM on hCA IX and XII, respectively), which shares the 4-fluorophenylureido tail with the clinicalcandidate. We investigated by means of X-ray crystallographic studies the bindingmodes of three selected compounds of this series to CA I. The evaluation oftherapeutic efficacy of compound 11 in an orthotopic, syngeneic model of CAIX-positive breast cancer in vivo showed close matching antitumoral effects andtolerance with SLC-0111.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00770 PMID: 29962205
