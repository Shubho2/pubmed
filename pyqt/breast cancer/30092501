The aim of this pilot was to test the effects of the PtDA on Shared Decision Making (SDM), Decision Evaluation(DES) in patients, consultation time, choice of aftercare and hospital costs.METHODS: A prospective before-and-after study including a control (no PtDA-usage)and experimental group (PtDA-usage during consultation) was conducted in sixhospitals. Patients were offered a choice between intensive (face-to-faceconsultations) and less intensive (telephonic or on demand consultations)aftercare. All patients filled out three validated questionnaires (baseline (T0),directly after the consultation (T1), three months later (T2)), assessingdemographics (T0), SDM(T1) and DES (T1, T2). Hospital costs and choice ofaftercare were assessed from the patients' files (T2). Effect sizes ( ɳp2:0.01 = small; 0.06 = medium; 0.14 = large; φ: 0.1 = small, 0.3 = medium,0.5 = large) and p-values were calculated using both univariate and multivariate GLMs, a repeated measures GLM and chi-square-tests.RESULTS: A small improvement in SDM ( ɳp2 = 0.02) and an effect ( ɳp2 = 0.10) on DES was found in the experimental group. Significantly more PtDA-users (51% vs.29%, φ = 0.22) chose less intensive aftercare, leading to a small reduction ofhospital costs (122 vs. 92 Euro, ɳp2 = 0.01), and a large increase in averageconsultation time (12.5 min; ɳp2 = 0.29).CONCLUSION: This pilot study showed promising effects of the PtDA on SDM andhospital costs. The PtDA can be developed further to potentially reduce theincreased consultation time.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.DOI: 10.1016/j.breast.2018.06.015 PMID: 30092501
