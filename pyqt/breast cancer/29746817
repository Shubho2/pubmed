Itseriously affects women's physical and mental health and the leading cause ofcancer death among women. Our previous study demonstrated that diet-derived IFN-γpromoted the malignant transformation of primary bovine mammary epithelial cells by accelerating arginine depletion. The current study aimed to explore whetherarginine addition could inhibit the degree of malignant transformation and itsmolecular mechanism. The results indicate that arginine addition could alleviate the malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells induced by IFN-γ,including reducing cell proliferation, cell migration and colony formation,through the NF-κB-GCN2/eIF2α pathway. The in vivo experiments also consistentlyconfirmed that arginine supplementation could significantly inhibit tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, the investigation of the clinical data alsorevealed that the plasma or tissue from human breast cancer patients owned lower arginine level and higher IFN-γ level than that from patients with benign breast disease, showing IFN-γ may be a potential control target. Our findingsdemonstrate that arginine supplement could antagonize the malignanttransformation of mammary epithelial cells induced by IFN-γ (nutritionallyinduced) both in vitro and in vivo, and IFN-γ was higher in breast cancer women. This might provide a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of breastcancer regarding to nutrition.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
