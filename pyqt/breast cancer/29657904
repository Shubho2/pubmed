Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute,Tampa, FL, USA.Purpose of Review: The breast tumor microenvironment is immunosuppressive and is increasingly recognized to play a significant role in tumorigenesis. A deeperunderstanding of normal and aberrant interactions between malignant and immunecells has allowed researchers to harness the immune system with novelimmunotherapy strategies, many of which have shown promise in breast cancer. Thisreview discusses the application of immunotherapy to the treatment of breastcancer.Recent Findings: Both basic science and clinical trial data are rapidlydeveloping in the use of immunotherapy for breast cancer. The current clinicaltrial landscape includes therapeutic vaccines, immune checkpoint blockade,antibodies, cytokines, and adoptive cell therapy.Summary: Despite early failures, the application of immunotherapeutic strategies to the treatment of breast cancer holds promise.PMCID: PMC5894864PMID: 29657904
