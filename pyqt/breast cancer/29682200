Inthis study, we compared the effects of CXCR4 antagonists on apoptosis inductionin hematopoietic cells and in tumor cells. We incubated cells expressing CXCR4with a series of CXCR4 antagonists and subsequently exposed the cultures to apro-apoptotic peptide derived from the HIV-1 Nef protein (NefM1). The NefM1peptide contains residues 50-60 of Nef and was previously shown to be thesequence necessary for Nef to initiate the apoptotic program through CXCR4signaling. We found that several of the compounds studied potently blockedNef-induced apoptosis in Jurkat T-lymphocyte cells. Interestingly, many of thesame compounds selectively triggered apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells,in some cases at sub-nanomolar concentrations. None of the compounds were toxicto lymphocyte, monocyte or macrophage cells, suggesting that aggressive breastcancer carcinomas may be selectively targeted and eliminated using CXCR4-basedtherapies without additional cytotoxic agents. Our results also demonstrate that not all CXCR4 antagonists are alike and that the observed anti-Nef andpro-apoptotic effects are chemically tunable. Collectively, these findingssuggest our CXCR4 antagonists have promising clinical utility for HIV or breastcancer therapies as well as being useful probes to examine the link between CXCR4and apoptosis.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24580 PMCID: PMC5908301PMID: 29682200
