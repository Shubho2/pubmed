The patient initially experiencedprogressive disease after a standard anthracycline/taxane-based adjuvantchemotherapy, a first-line treatment for metastatic disease withpaclitaxel-bevacizumab, and a second-line maintenance treatment with bevacizumab and capecitabine. Eribulin was administered according to a 1.23 mg/m2 scheme ondays 1 and 8 every 3 weeks, and the treatment was always well tolerated. After 45cycles of therapy, we still detected radiological evidence of complete responseon liver sites of disease. This case report underlines the great efficacy oferibulin as third-line treatment for metastatic disease in a very aggressive formof breast cancer.Â© 2018 S.
