Attempts have been made to developimmunohistochemical surrogates, which nearly always focus on membranous claudinexpression.METHODS: We assessed the immunohistochemical expression of both membranous andcytoplasmic claudins 3, 4 and 7 in a series of 197 non-metastatic breast cancers,enriched with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs; 60%). The expression ofepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-regulating transcription factors Sip1, Zeb1 and vimentin had previously been determined in the same material.RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, strong cytoplasmic claudin 3 expression wasassociated with poor relapse-free survival (RFS), disease-free survival, distant disease-free survival, breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival amongTNBC patients (for RFS, RR 5.202, 95% CI 1.210-22.369, p = 0.027, vs. T-class, RR0.663, 95% CI 0.168-2.623, p = 0.558, and N-class, RR 3.940, 95% CI 0.933-16.631,p = 0.062). Cytoplasmic claudin 3 expression was also associated with strongnuclear Sip1 expression (p = 0.000053), TNBC phenotype (p = 0.012) and withinthem, non-basal-like phenotype (p = 0.026). Cytoplasmic claudin 7 was associated with dismal RFS (RR 6.328, 95% CI 1.401-28.593, p = 0.016, vs. T-class, RR 0.692,95% CI 0.242-1.982, p = 0.493, and N-class, RR 2.981, 95% CI 1.1016-8.749,p = 0.047). Low cytoplasmic expression of claudins 3, 4 and 7 together alsopredicted poor RFS (RR 6.070, 95% CI 1.347-27.363, p = 0.019, vs. T-class, RR0.677, 95% CI 0.237-1.934, p = 0.467, and N-class, RR 3.167, 95% CI 1.079-9.290, p = 0.036).CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical expression levels of cytoplasmic claudins 3 and 7 appear to be novel prognostic factors in TNBC.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4141-z PMID: 29482498
