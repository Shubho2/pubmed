Median follow-up was 38.1 months. Median age was 53 years.Chemotherapy was administered to 83% of patients. All 133 hormone receptorpositive tumours received hormonal therapy. As concurrent treatment, apart fromtrastuzumab monotherapy, 6 patients received systemic therapy concomitant to RT. The HT was generally well tolerated with mostly grade 1 and 2 skin reactions and esophagitis. Only 3% grade III early skin reactions. At last follow-up, therewere 2 local recurrences, 1 regional lymph node (LN) recurrence and 6 withmetastatic progression. The 5-year progression-free survival was 90.5% (95% CI84.2-97.3).Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of all patients treated by HTbetween 2009 and 2015 was done. Patients excluded were those with: breastimplants, advanced or metastatic BC, recurrent disease. All patients receivedbreast+/-boost or chest wall irradiation and most received with LN irradiation.Dose constraints for organs at risk were defined using optimization scaledeveloped in our Department. Evaluation of early and late toxicity was done usingCommon Terminology Adverse Criteria Events v.4.0.Conclusions: HT can be used for a well selected group of breast cancer asbilateral tumours, complex anatomy and target volumes where the conventionalradiation therapy techniques cannot ensure an optimal dose distribution. Longerfollow-up is necessary to confirm and validate these results.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25286 PMCID: PMC5955102PMID: 29805760
