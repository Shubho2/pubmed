Here, we report that LSD1 is also an integral component of the SIN3A/HDAC complex.Transcriptional target analysis using ChIP-on-chip technology revealed that theLSD1/SIN3A/HDAC complex targets several cellular signalling pathways that arecritically involved in cell proliferation, survival, metastasis, and apoptosis,especially the p53 signalling pathway. We have demonstrated that LSD1 coordinateswith the SIN3A/HDAC complex in inhibiting a series of genes such as CASP7, TGFB2,CDKN1A(p21), HIF1A, TERT, and MDM2, some of which are oncogenic. Our experiments also found that LSD1 and SIN3A are required for optimal survival and growth ofbreast cancer cells while also essential for the maintenance of epithelialhomoeostasis and chemosensitivity. Our data indicate that LSD1 is a functionalalternative subunit of the SIN3A/HDAC complex, providing a molecular basis forthe interplay of histone demethylation and deacetylation in chromatinremodelling, and suggest that the LSD1/SIN3A/HDAC complex could be a target forbreast cancer therapeutic strategies.DOI: 10.1093/jmcb/mjy021 PMID: 29741645
