HER2 alterations have been suggested to be atherapeutic target in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), just as in breast andgastric cancers. We previously reported that the pan-HER inhibitor afatinib couldbe a useful therapeutic agent as HER2-targeted therapy for patients with NSCLCharboring HER2 alterations. However, acquired resistance to afatinib was observedin the clinical setting, similar to the case for other HER inhibitors. Thus,elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the development of acquired drugresistance and exploring means to overcome acquired drug resistance are importantissues in the treatment of NSCLC. In this study, we experimentally establishedafatinib-resistant cell lines from NSCLC cell lines harboring HER2 alterations,and investigated the mechanisms underlying the acquisition of drug resistance.The established cell lines showed several unique afatinib-resistance mechanisms, including MET amplification, loss of HER2 amplification and gene expression,epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and acquisition of cancer stem cell(CSC)-like features. The afatinib-resistant cell lines showing MET amplification were sensitive to the combination of afatinib plus crizotinib (a MET inhibitor), both in vitro and in vivo. The resistant cell lines which showed EMT or hadacquired CSC-like features remained sensitive to docetaxel, like the parentalcells. These findings may provide clues to countering the resistance to afatinib in NSCLC patients with HER2 alterations.Â© 2018 The Authors.
