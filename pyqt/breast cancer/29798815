The aims of the present study were to determine the risk factorsassociated with the underestimation of DCIS and to develop a model to predict theprobability of invasiveness.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the data for allpatients with a diagnosis of DCIS found by percutaneous biopsy from January 2008 to February 2016. Thirteen potential predictors of invasiveness were examined.The statistical analysis of the present study was improved using Nagelkerke's R2,the area under the receiving operating characteristic (AUC) curve, and theHosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.RESULTS: Of 354 biopsy specimens deemed to be DCIS on initial biopsy, 100 (28.2%)were recategorized as invasive carcinoma after surgery. On multivariate analysis,the strongest predictors of invasiveness were comedonecrosis, size onmammography, suspected microinvasion, histologic grade, and younger patient age. The model had a good discriminative ability, with an AUC of 0.764. The overallperformance of the model was fair, with a Nagelkerke's R2 of 40.9%. A separateanalysis performed on 274 specimens obtained through vacuum-assisted biopsyrevealed different variables were associated with underestimation; however, asimilar AUC (0.743) and Nagelkerke's R2 (45.7%) were obtained.CONCLUSION: Our model had the best AUC for predicting DCIS invasiveness reported to date. However, further statistical analysis showed only a fair overallperformance. The currently known clinical, radiographic, and pathologic features might be insufficient to identify which patients with DCIS have underestimateddisease.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
