However, the mechanism has not beenclearly elucidated. The purpose of this study was (1) to evaluate the outcome of vascularized groin lymph node (VGLN) transfer using axilla as a recipient site inpatients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) and (2) to provideradiological evidence of lymphangiogenesis in VLNT.METHODS: Between August 2013 and June 2016, 30 consecutive patients with a meanage of 60 years underwent VGLN transfer for BCRL. A skinless VGLN flap nourished by the superficial circumflex iliac vessels was transferred to the axillaryregion of the lymphedematous limb. The outcomes were assessed clinically withlimb circumference measurement and radiologically with lymphoscintigraphy.RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 22.11 ± 7.83 months, 21 (70%) patients hadreduction in limb circumference. The mean circumference reduction rate of thelymphedematous limb was 47.06% ± 27.92% (range, 0% to 100%). Eleven (37%)patients showed radiological improvement in postoperative lymphoscintigraphy thatincluded 7 cases of faster contrast transport and 4 cases of visualization oftransplanted lymph node.CONCLUSION: Patients with BCRL can benefit from orthotopic VGLN transfer.Lymphangiogenesis is supported by the appearance of transplanted lymph nodes inpostoperative lymphoscintigraphy.Copyright © 2018 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and AestheticSurgeons.
