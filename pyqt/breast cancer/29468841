In vitro metabolism data suggested osimertinib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4/5, a weakinducer of CYP3A, and an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). A combination of in vitro data, clinical pharmacokinetic data, and drug-druginteraction (DDI) data of osimertinib in oncology patients were used to developthe physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and verify the DDI data ofosimertinib. The model predicted the observed monotherapy concentration profileof osimertinib within 1.1-fold, and showed good predictability (within 1.7-fold) to the observed peak plasma concentration (Cmax ) and area under the curve (AUC) DDI ratio changes, when co-administered with rifampicin, itraconazole, andsimvastatin, but not with rosuvastatin. Based on observed clinical data and PBPK simulations, the recommended dose of osimertinib when dosed with strong CYP3Ainducers is 160 mg once daily. PBPK modeling suggested no dose adjustment withmoderate and weak CYP3A inducers.Â© 2018 The Authors CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology published by WileyPeriodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for CPT: Pharmacometrics &Systems Pharmacology.DOI: 10.1002/psp4.12289 PMCID: PMC5980577PMID: 29468841
