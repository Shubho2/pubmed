Co-amplification atlower denaturation temperature-PCR (COLD-PCR) assays are sensitive methods, buthave previously only been able to analyze loss of DNA methylation.MATERIALS & METHODS: Enhanced (E)-ice-COLD-PCR reactions starting from 2 ng ofbisulfite-converted DNA were developed to analyze methylation patterns in twopromoters with locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes blocking amplification ofunmethylated CpGs. The enrichment of methylated molecules was compared toquantitative (q)PCR and quantified using serial dilutions.RESULTS: E-ice-COLD-PCR allowed the multiplexed enrichment and quantification of methylated DNA. Assays were validated in primary breast cancer specimens andcirculating cell-free DNA from cancer patients.CONCLUSION: E-ice-COLD-PCR could prove a useful tool in the context of DNAmethylation analysis for personalized medicine.DOI: 10.2217/epi-2017-0166 PMID: 29697281
