Preclinical studies suggest thatlifestyle modifications may exert favorable effects on tumor biology. Randomized controlled trials in the presurgical setting serve as an ideal means to translatethis research to humans; however, little is known about the characteristics ofpatients who enroll in these presurgical trials versus those who do not.Methods: Screening databases from three presurgical lifestyle intervention trialsfor breast and prostate cancer patients conducted at Duke University MedicalCenter (NCT00049309) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (NCT02224807 andNCT01886677) were combined for analysis. Demographic and anthropometricdifferences between enrolled vs. non-enrolled individuals were assessed usingChi-square for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables.Results: There was no difference in participation rate when comparing minoritystatus or overweight and obese patients. However, obese females were slightlymore likely to enroll than women who were overweight (p = 0.110), a trend notseen in men. Women were also less likely than men to participate if their studysite was >25 miles from their home (p = 0.034). Patients who had completed acollege degree were somewhat less likely to enroll than those with lesseducational attainment (p = 0.072). Of those who did not enroll, 80% cited a lackof time.Conclusion: Similar to other clinical trials, lack of time is a leading barrierto enrollment, and travel/distance appears to be a greater barrier for women inpresurgical studies. Larger presurgical lifestyle intervention trials willrequire tailored strategies to enhance recruitment.DOI: 10.1016/j.conctc.2017.11.003 PMCID: PMC5898572PMID: 29696211
