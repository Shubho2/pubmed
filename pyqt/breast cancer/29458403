In thisstudy, we assessed the informative value of research on the quality of cancercare, exploring to what extent it is actually concerned with care overuse, thusproviding policy-makers with sound estimates of overuse prevalence. We searchedMedline for European studies, reporting information on the rate of use ofdiagnostic or therapeutic procedures/interventions in breast, colorectal, lungand prostate cancer patients, published in English between 2006 and 2016.Individual studies were classified with regards to their orientation towardsoveruse according to the quality metrics adopted in assessing rates of use ofprocedures and interventions.Out of 1882 papers identified, 100 accounting for 94studies met our eligibility criteria, most of them on breast (n = 38) andcolorectal (n = 30) cancer. Of these, 46 (49%) studies relied on processindicators allowing a direct measure of under- or overuse, the latter beingaddressed in 22 (24%) studies. Search for overuse in patterns of care did notincrease over time, with overuse being measured in 24% of the studies publishedbefore 2010, and in only 13% of those published in 2015-2016. Information on its prevalence was available only for a relatively limited number ofprocedures/interventions. Overall, estimates of overuse tended to be higher fordiagnostic procedures (median prevalence across all studies, 24%) than for drugs,surgical procedures or radiotherapy (median overuse prevalence always lower than 10%). Despite its increasing policy relevance, overuse is still an oftenoverlooked issue in current European research on the quality of care for cancerpatients.DOI: 10.1186/s12961-018-0287-z PMCID: PMC5819192PMID: 29458403
