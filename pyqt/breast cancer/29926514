MYL-1401O is a trastuzumab biosimilar.Here, we report results from a phase 1 study that investigated bioequivalenceamong MYL-1401O, reference EU-trastuzumab and US-trastuzumab.METHODS: This single-centre, randomized, double-blind, three-arm, parallel-group,phase 1 study was conducted in healthy adult male volunteers. Subjects wererandomized 1:1:1 to receive a single 8 mg kg-1 dose of MYL-1401O, EU-trastuzumab or US-trastuzumab as a 90-min intravenous infusion. The primary objective was to assess PK similarity among all three products. Primary endpoints assessed werepeak serum concentration (Cmax), area under the serum concentration-time curvefrom time of dosing to time of last quantifiable concentration and from time ofdosing to infinity. Secondary endpoints included time of Cmax, elimination rateconstant, half-life, safety and immunogenicity.RESULTS: Of 132 subjects enrolled (44/treatment), 120 (MYL-1401O, n = 42;EU-trastuzumab, n = 41; US-trastuzumab, n = 37) were included in the PK analysis.The 90% confidence intervals of the ratios of geometric means for the primaryendpoints were bounded within the predefined bioequivalence criterion of 80-125%.Secondary endpoints time of Cmax, elimination rate constant and half-life weresimilar among groups. All treatment-emergent adverse events were mild ormoderate, similar across groups and no serious adverse events were reported. Notreatment-related antidrug antibodies were detected.CONCLUSIONS: MYL-1401O was well tolerated and demonstrated PK and safety profilessimilar to EU-trastuzumab and US-trastuzumab in healthy volunteers(ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02594761).© 2018 The British Pharmacological Society.DOI: 10.1111/bcp.13689 PMID: 29926514
