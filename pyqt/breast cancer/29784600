Electronic address: ashalim@usm.my.BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction after mastectomy is important in breast cancer care.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed to assess surgeons'and patients' perceptions toward breast reconstruction. Questionnaires weredistributed to general and breast surgeons in East Coast Malaysian hospitals and Hospital Kuala Lumpur and to postmastectomy patients with and without breastreconstruction at the Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia and Hospital RajaPerempuan Zainab II. The response rates were 82.5% for the surgeons (n = 33),95.4% for the patients with reconstruction (n = 63), and 95.5% for the patientswithout reconstruction (n = 278).RESULTS: The median surgeon age and experience was 42 and 6 years, respectively. Each surgeon saw an average of 20 new breast cancer cases annually. Most surgeons(86.7%) discussed reconstruction options with their patients but had onlyreferred an average of 4 patients for reconstruction during a 3-year period.Surgeons' concerns regarding the qualitative outcome increased the likelihood of a breast reconstruction discussion (β = 4.833; P = .044). The women who underwentbreast reconstruction were younger (mean age, 42 vs. 50 years), were more oftenworking (69.4% vs. 42.2%), and more often had previous awareness of the option(90.3% vs. 44.3%). The most common reasons for undergoing breast reconstructionwere "to feel more balanced" (92.1%) and "surgeon's strong recommendation"(92.1%). Previous knowledge of breast reconstruction increased the likelihood of reconstruction (odds ratio, 5.805; P = .026). Although 70% of surgeons thoughtthat patients would not be interested in reconstruction, only 37.9% of patientswith previous awareness reported having no interest.CONCLUSION: The low reconstruction rate (20.6%) can be attributed to the lowreferral rate. Patients' likelihood to undergo reconstruction with theirsurgeon's recommendation and with previous awareness were reflective of thesurgeons' strong influence on their patients. Thus, clarification of surgeons'hypothetical criticisms could conceivably increase the reconstructive surgeryrate.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
