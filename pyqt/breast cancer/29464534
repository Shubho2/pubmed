Statistical comparison between the groups was performed by ANOVA. Direct comparison of two groups wasdone by a two-tailed t test. Correlations between variables were done byPearson's method.RESULTS: Expression of GLI1 and its target genes correlated significantly withworse distant DFS in breast cancer patients with Luminal A molecular subtype.Particularly, co-expression of GLI1 with EGFR and/or SNAI1, two of the identifiedGLI1 targets, was predictive of worse distant DFS in this subtype. Furthermore,patients with Luminal A tumors with a high GLI1 signature had a shorter distantDFS compared to the Luminal B subtype and the outcome for this group wascomparable to patients with HER2-positive or basal-like tumors.CONCLUSION: We have identified a novel GLI1 gene signature that is associatedwith worse clinical outcomes among the patients with Luminal A subtype of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4718-x PMID: 29464534
