Despite the highfrequency of radiation to bone in patients with metastatic bone disease, ourknowledge of associated healthcare resource utilization (HRU) is limited.Methods: This retrospective study estimated HRU following radiation to bone inAustria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Sweden andSwitzerland. Eligible patients were ≥ 20 years old, had bone metastases secondaryto breast, lung or prostate cancer, or bone lesions associated with multiplemyeloma, and had received radiation to bone between 1 July 2004 and 1 July 2009. HRU data were extracted from hospital patient charts from 3.5 months before theindex SRE (radiation to bone preceded by a SRE-free period of ≥ 6.5 months) until3 months after the last SRE that the patient experienced during the study period.Results: In total, 482 patients were included. The number of inpatient staysincreased from baseline by a mean of 0.52 (standard deviation [SD] 1.17) staysper radiation to bone event and the duration of stays increased by a mean of 7.8 (SD 14.8) days. Outpatient visits increased by a mean of 4.24 (SD 6.57) visitsand procedures by a mean of 8.51 (SD 7.46) procedures.Conclusion: HRU increased following radiation to bone across all countriesstudied. Agents that prevent severe pain and delay the need for radiation havethe potential to reduce the burden imposed on healthcare resources and patients.DOI: 10.1016/j.jbo.2018.01.003 PMCID: PMC5865076PMID: 29577024
