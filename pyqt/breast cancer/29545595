This study aimed to evaluate thebiological and prognostic value of the membrane solute carrier, SLC3A2 in BC withemphasis on the intrinsic molecular subtypes. SLC3A2 was assessed at the genomic level, using METABRIC data (n = 1980), and at the proteomic level, usingimmunohistochemistry on tissue microarray (TMA) sections constructed from a largewell-characterised primary BC cohort (n = 2500). SLC3A2 expression was correlatedwith clinicopathological parameters, molecular subtypes and patient outcome.SLC3A2 mRNA and protein expression were strongly correlated with higher tumourgrade and poor Nottingham prognostic index (NPI). High expression of SLC3A2 wasobserved in triple-negative (TN), HER2+ and ER+ high-proliferation subtypes.SLC3A2 mRNA and protein expression were significantly associated with theexpression of c-MYC in all BC subtypes (p < 0.001). High expression of SLC3A2protein was associated with poor patient outcome (p < 0.001), but only in the ER+high-proliferation (p = 0.01) and TN (p = 0.04) subtypes. In multivariateanalysis SLC3A2 protein was an independent risk factor for shorter BC-specificsurvival (p < 0.001). SLC3A2 appears to play a role in the aggressive BC subtypesdriven by MYC and could act as a potential prognostic marker. Functionalassessment is necessary to reveal its potential therapeutic value in thedifferent BC subtypes.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0038-5 PMCID: PMC5931111 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29545595
