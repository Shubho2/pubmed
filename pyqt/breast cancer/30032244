Chemokine (C-Cmotif) receptor 7 (CCR7) plays important roles in breast cancer metastasis.However, the role of CCR7 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not beenfully elucidated. In this study, we found that CCR7 is highly expressed in bothTNBC cell lines and breast cancer tissues. CCR7 was knocked down by shRNA in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231, two TNBC cell lines, and we found that the depletion of CCR7significantly decreased TNBC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro.Furthermore, we confirmed that the knockdown of CCR7 reduced the distantmetastasis of 4T1 cells in an orthotopic mouse model. Proteomic analysis in 4T1cells indicated that several signaling pathways such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule might contribute to CCR7's function in breast cancer metastasis. Ourresults suggest that CCR7 promotes TNBC metastasis and may serve as a target for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.DOI: 10.1093/abbs/gmy077 PMID: 30032244
