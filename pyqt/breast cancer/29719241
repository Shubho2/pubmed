Electronic address:john.condeelis@einstein.yu.edu.Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are critical for tumor metastasis. Two TAMsubsets support cancer cell intravasation: migratory macrophages guide cancercells toward blood vessels, where sessile perivascular macrophages assist theirentry into the blood. However, little is known about the inter-relationshipbetween these functionally distinct TAMs or their possible inter-conversion. Weshow that motile, streaming TAMs are newly arrived monocytes, recruited via CCR2 signaling, that then differentiate into the sessile perivascular macrophages.This unidirectional process is regulated by CXCL12 and CXCR4. Cancer cells induceTGF-β-dependent upregulation of CXCR4 in monocytes, while CXCL12 expressed byperivascular fibroblasts attracts these motile TAMs toward the blood vessels,bringing motile cancer cells with them. Once on the blood vessel, the migratoryTAMs differentiate into perivascular macrophages, promoting vascular leakinessand intravasation.Copyright © 2018 The Francis Crick Institute.
