Therefore, to find out a safe anticancer drug has been long goal foroncologist and medical scientists. Among clinically used medicines with no orlittle toxicity, fenofibrate is a drug of the fibrate class that plays animportant role in lowering the levels of serum cholesterol and triglycerideswhile elevating the levels of high-density lipoproteins. Recently, severalstudies have implied that fenofibrate may exert anticancer effects via a variety of pathways involved in apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, invasion, and migration.Given the great potential that fenofibrate may have anticancer effects, thisreview was to investigate all published works which directly or indirectlysupport the anticancer activity of fenofibrate. These studies provide evidencethat fenofibrate exerted antitumor effects in several human cancer cell lines,such as breast, liver, glioma, prostate, pancreas, and lung cancer cell lines.Among these studies some have further confirmed the possibility and efficacy offenofibrate anticancer in xenograft mouse models. In the last part of thisreview, we also discuss the potential mechanisms of action of fenofibrate basedon the available information. Overall, we may repurpose fenofibrate as ananticancer drug in cancer treatment, which urgently need further andcomprehensively investigated.DOI: 10.7150/jca.24488 PMCID: PMC5950581PMID: 29760790
