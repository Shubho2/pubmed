However, theutility of histologic subtyping in TNBC has not yet been well-characterised. Thisstudy utilises data from the National Cancer Center Database (NCDB) to completethe largest series to date investigating the prognostic importance of histologywithin TNBC.METHODS: A total of 729,920 patients (pts) with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC), medullary breast carcinoma (MedBC), adenoidcystic carcinoma (ACC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) or apocrine breastcarcinoma (ABC) treated between 2004 and 2012 were identified in the NCDB. Ofthese, 89,222 pts with TNBC that received surgery were analysed. Kaplan-Meieranalysis, log-rank testing and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regressionwere utilised with overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome.RESULTS: MBC (74.1%), MedBC (60.6%), ACC (75.7%), ABC (50.1%) and ILC (1.8%) had significantly different proportions of triple negativity when compared to IDC(14.0%, p < 0.001). TNBC predicted an inferior OS in IDC (p < 0.001) and ILC(p < 0.001). Lumpectomy and radiation (RT) were more common in MedBC (51.7%) and ACC (51.5%) and less common in MBC (33.1%) and ILC (25.4%), when compared to IDC (42.5%, p < 0.001). TNBC patients with MBC (HR 1.39, p < 0.001), MedBC (HR 0.42, p < 0.001) and ACC (HR 0.32, p = 0.003) differed significantly in OS whencompared to IDC.CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicate that histologic heterogeneity in TNBCsignificantly informs patient outcomes and thus, has the potential to aid in the development of optimum personalised treatments.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
