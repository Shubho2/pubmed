[Epub ahead ofprint]SECOND CANCER RISK FROM RADIATION THERAPY FOR COMMON SOLID TUMORS DIAGNOSED INREPRODUCTIVE-AGED FEMALES.Mazonakis M(1), Kachris S(2), Damilakis J(1).Author information: (1)Department of Medical Physics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Crete, 71003Iraklion, Crete, Greece.(2)Department of Radiotherapy and Oncolgy, University Hospital of Iraklion, 71110Iraklion, Crete, Greece.This study provided second cancer risk estimates from radiation therapy forcommon solid tumors presented in reproductive-aged females. Three-dimensionaltreatment plans were generated for 10 patients with cervical, uterine, rectal,lung or breast carcinomas. The organ equivalent dose (OED) and the lifetimeattributable risk (LAR) for carcinogenesis to organs receiving high doses wereestimated for all study participants with a mechanistic model. This modelaccounts for cell-killing, tissue repair and dose fractionation effects. Thepatient- and organ-specific relative risk was assessed by using the LARs and the respective lifetime intrinsic cancer risks for unexposed population. The OED ofthe organs-at-risk varied from 17.3 to 1423.1 rad. The LAR range for bladder,colon, lung and breast cancer induction was 0.12-0.14%, 10.88-12.71%, 1.66-8.62% and 0.71-3.75%, respectively. The relative risk for the appearance of bladder,colon, lung and breast malignancies following radiotherapy was up to 1.12, 4.05, 2.42 and 1.31, respectively.DOI: 10.1093/rpd/ncy050 PMID: 29608744
