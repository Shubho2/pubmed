Electronic address: scx_cjuh@163.com.Transcription factor forkhead box D1 (FOXD1), a member of forkhead box family,has been recognized as a caner-related gene. Aberrant expression of FOXD1 isobserved in glioma, lung cancer and breast cancer. However, the clinicalsignificance of FOXD1 and its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) are unknown. Here, we found that FOXD1 displayed a higher expression in CRC tissues compared totumor-adjacent tissues. Upregulation of FOXD1 was further confirmed in CRCtissues compared to normal tissues based on data from three GSE cohorts. Ourclinical data indicated that high FOXD1 level was associated with tumor size(≥5 cm) and TNM tumor stage (III + IV). Moreover, both our data and TCGA datafound that high expression of FOXD1 predicted poor prognosis of CRC patients.Next, we revealed that FOXD1 knockdown suppressed proliferation, cell cycleprogression and induced apoptosis of SW480 cells in vitro. In accordance, FOXD1overexpression promoted proliferation and reduced apoptosis of HT29 cells.Interestingly, polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2) expression was elevated and itpositively correlated with FOXD1 expression in CRC tissues. FOXD1 promoted theexpression of Plk2 mRNA and protein in CRC cells. Notably, Plk2 restorationabolished the effect of FOXD1 knockdown on proliferation and apoptosis of SW480cells. Plk2 knockdown resulted in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosisof FOXD1-overexpressing HT29 cells. Altogether, we demonstrate for the first timethat FOXD1 functions as an oncoprotein and a potential prognostic biomarker inCRC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
