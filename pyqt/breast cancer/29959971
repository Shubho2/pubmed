[Epub ahead of print]Molecular mechanisms underlying progesterone-induced cytoplasmic retention of p27in breast cancer cells.Wang HC(1), Lee WS(2).Author information: (1)(a)Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei MedicalUniversity, Taipei, 110, Taiwan.(2)(a)Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei MedicalUniversity, Taipei, 110, Taiwan; (b)Department of Physiology, School of Medicine,College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, 110, Taiwan; (c)CancerResearch Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, 110, Taiwan.Electronic address: wslee@tmu.edu.tw.It has been reported that progesterone (P4) can contribute to the aggressiveness of human breast cancers through promoting cytoplasmic localization of p27 andstimulating proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlyingP4-induced cytoplasmic retention of p27 are still unclear. Here, we demonstrated that P4 (12.5-100 nM) concentration-dependently increased the number of T47D and MCF-7 cells. P4 (50 nM) also time-dependently increased the levels of p27protein. Knock-down of p27 using the small interfering RNA (siRNA) techniqueabolished the P4-increased cell number of T47D and MCF-7. The signaling pathwayinvolved in the P4-promoted breast cancer cell proliferation was furtherinvestigated. Our results suggest that P4 activated the PI3K/AKT-mediatedsignaling, subsequently increasing phophorylation of p27 at pT198 and T157, andthereby caused cytoplasmic retention of p27 protein. In addition, P4 activatedkinase-interacting stathmin (KIS), subsequently increasing phosphorylation ofnuclear p27 at serine 10 (S10), and thereby caused cytoplasmic translocation ofp27pS10 from the nucleus. P4 also increased the level of nuclear CDK2pT160,thereby inducing p27 phosphorylation at T187, and hence caused cytosolictranslocation of p27pT187 from the nucleus. In the cytosol, both p27pS10 andp27pT187 were degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Taken together, our data suggest that P4 promoted breast cancer cell proliferation throughcytoplasmic retention of p27pT157 and p27pT198 and nuclear export of p27pS10 and p27pT187.Copyright © 2018.
