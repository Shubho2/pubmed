Hence, we sought to compare the efficacy of aprepitant (APT) versusolanzapine (OLP) in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) inbreast cancer patients on doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, open-label, nonrandomized study wasconducted at the Department of Oncology. Eighty-three patients completed thestudy with 43 in the APT group and 40 in OLP group. Data about nausea andvomiting were collected using Multinational Association of Supportive Care inCancer Antiemesis Tool (MAT). The severity of nausea and vomiting was assessed bythe MAT and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, respectively.RESULTS: Complete response (no emesis and no rescue medication) was achieved in81% of the patients in APT group and 85% in the OLP group in the acute period (P = 0.661); 74% of patients in APT group and 85% in OLP group had no nausea during the same period (P = 0.233). Among the OLP patients who had nausea, 67% hadmoderately severe and 33% had Severe grade, and in the APT group, severity wasequally distributed in mild, moderate, and severe grades. Among the patients who had vomiting, severe (CTCAE) vomiting was noticed in 81% of patients who weretreated with APT compared to 50% in OLP group.CONCLUSION: OLP was found to be an equally effective alternative to APT in theantiemetic prophylaxis of CINV in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapywith doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide regimen.DOI: 10.4103/ijp.IJP_846_16 PMCID: PMC5892027PMID: 29674800
