Items referred to 1. general topics (country, centre, years of experience in breastcancer); 2. clinical decision making; 3. RT techniques and dosimetry; 4. dosefractionation.RESULTS: 283 responses were received from 19 countries. Most responders worked inpublic health services and in academic institutions and had 5-20 yearsexperience. Although many indicated they were consulted about the timing and typeof breast reconstructive surgery, final decisions were most often made bysurgeons. Immediate reconstruction with expander followed by RT and subsequently permanent reconstruction with prosthesis was recommended by 61.6% of responders. Most (48.4%) adviced a boost only when margins were close or involved with ananother 17.7% recommending it in the presence of high-risk features (T3-T4,lympho-vascular involvement). Intensity modulated RT was rarely used by abouttwo-thirds of responders, except when with 3D technique the dose constraints werenot achieved or when regional lymph nodes were included. Almost 60% of respondersdid not use bolus/tissue equivalent material (TEM). The main indication forbolus/TEM use was skin involvement. The majority of responders used 1.8-2 Gy per fraction.CONCLUSIONS: The present survey highlighted controversial areas in clinicalpractise, confirming the uncertainties about the scheduling of PMRT and breastreconstruction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
