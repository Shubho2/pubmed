Electronic address: yehuda@bgu.ac.il.The main focus of this pilot study is to develop a statistical approach that issuitable to model data obtained by different detection methods. The methods used in this study examine the possibility to detect early breast cancer (BC) byexhaled breath and urine samples analysis. Exhaled breath samples were collected from 48 breast cancer patients and 45 healthy women that served as a controlgroup. Urine samples were collected from 37 patients who were diagnosed withbreast cancer based on physical or mammography tests prior to any surgery, andfrom 36 healthy women. Two commercial electronic noses (ENs) were used for theexhaled breath analysis. Urine samples were analyzed using Gas-ChromatographyMass-Spectrometry (GC-MS). Statistical analysis of results is based on anartificial neural network (ANN) obtained following feature extraction and featureselection processes. The model obtained allows classification of breast cancerpatients with an accuracy of 95.2% ± 7.7% using data of one EN, and an accuracyof 85% for the other EN and for urine samples. The developed statistical analysismethod enables accurate classification of patients as healthy or with BC based onsimple non-invasive exhaled breath and a urine sample analysis. This studydemonstrates that available commercial ENs can be used, provided that the dataanalysis is carried out using an appropriate scheme.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
