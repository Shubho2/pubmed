This Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) is overexpressed in human luminal breastcancer, and its expression associates with disease progression, metastaticdissemination and poor outcome. Despite the established contribution of P-Rex1 toRac activation and cell locomotion, whether this Rac-GEF has any relevant role inmitogenesis has been a subject of controversy. To tackle the discrepancies among various reports, we carried out an exhaustive analysis of the potentialinvolvement of P-Rex1 on the activation of the mitogenic Erk pathway. Using arange of luminal breast cancer cellular models, we unequivocally showed thatsilencing P-Rex1 (transiently, stably, using multiple siRNA sequences) had noeffect on the phospho-Erk response upon stimulation with growth factors (EGF,heregulin, IGF-I) or a GPCR ligand (SDF-1). The lack of involvement of P-Rex1 in Erk activation was confirmed at the single cell level using a fluorescentbiosensor of Erk kinase activity. Depletion of P-Rex1 from breast cancer cellsfailed to affect cell cycle progression, cyclin D1 induction, Akt activation and apoptotic responses. In addition, mammary-specific P-Rex1 transgenic mice(MMTV-P-Rex1) did not show any obvious hyperproliferative phenotype. Therefore,despite its crucial role in Rac1 activation and cell motility, P-Rex1 isdispensable for mitogenic or survival responses in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25584 PMCID: PMC6033363PMID: 29983884
