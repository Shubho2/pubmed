In breast cancer, most of the detected gene fusions seem to be"passenger" events while the presence of recurrent and driver fusions is stillunder study. We performed RNA sequencing in 55 well-characterized breast cancersamples and 10 adjacent normal breast tissues, complemented by an analysis of SNParray data. We explored the presence of fusion genes and defined theirassociation with breast cancer subtypes, clinical-pathologic characteristics and copy number aberrations. Overall, 370 fusions were detected across the majorityof the samples. HER2+ samples had significantly more fusions than triple negativeand luminal subtypes. The number of fusions was correlated with histologicalgrade, Ki67 and tumor size. Clusters of fusion genes were observed across thegenome and a significant correlation of fusions with copy number aberrations and more specifically amplifications was also revealed. Despite the large number offusion events, only a few were recurrent, while recurrent individual genesforming fusions with different partners were also detected including the estrogenreceptor 1 gene in the previously detected ESR1-CCDC170 fusion. Overall wedetected novel gene fusion events while we confirmed previously reported fusions.Genomic hotspots of fusion genes, differences between subtypes and small numberof recurrent fusions are the most relevant characteristics of these events inbreast cancer. Further investigation is necessary to comprehend the biologicalsignificance of these fusions.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/gcc.22533 PMID: 29436103
