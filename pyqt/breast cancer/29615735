To understand thepotential role of osteocytes in bone metastasis, we investigated tumor-osteocyte interactions using two cell lines derived from the MDA-MB-231 breast cancercells, primary breast cancer cells, and MLO-A5/MLO-Y4 osteocyte cells. Whenthree-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids were grown with osteocyte spheroids, tumorspheroids fused with osteocyte spheroids and shrank. This size reduction was alsoobserved when tumor spheroids were exposed to conditioned medium isolated fromosteocyte cells. Mass spectrometry-based analysis predicted that several bonematrix proteins (e.g., collagen, biglycan) in conditioned medium could beresponsible for tumor shrinkage. The osteocyte-driven shrinkage was mimicked bytype I collagen, the most abundant organic component in bone, but not byhydroxyapatite, a major inorganic component in bone. RNA and protein expressionanalysis revealed that tumor-osteocyte interactions downregulated Snail, atranscription factor involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Anagarose bead assay showed that bone matrix proteins act as a tumor attractant.Collectively, the study herein demonstrates that osteocytes attract and compactmigratory breast cancer cells through bone matrix proteins, suppress tumormigration, by Snail downregulation, and promote subsequent metastaticcolonization.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-23833-1 PMCID: PMC5882940PMID: 29615735
