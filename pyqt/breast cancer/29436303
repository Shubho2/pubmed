The objective of this study is to examine the impact ofthe ACA on insurance rates among patients newly diagnosed with colon, lung, orbreast cancer.METHODS: Using the SEER database, patients younger than age 65 years diagnosedwith colon, lung, or breast cancer between 2008 and 2014 were identified.Insurance rates were examined before versus after passage of the ACA (2011) andbefore (2011 to 2013) versus after (2014) Medicaid expansion in nine expansionstates and five nonexpansion states. Difference-in-differences models were usedto estimate the differential impact of ACA in expansion compared withnonexpansion states.RESULTS: A total of 414,085 patients with known insurance status were diagnosedwith colon, lung, or breast cancer between 2008 and 2014. For all cancer types,there was a significant increase in patients enrolled in Medicaid after 2011 inexpansion states. Between 2011 to 2013 and 2014, in patients living in stateswith Medicaid expansion, the uninsured rates decreased by â‰¥ 50% among patientswith a new diagnosis of lung and colon cancer (6.5% in 2011 to 2013 to 3.1% in2014 and 6.8% in 2011 to 2013 to 3.4% in 2014, respectively; P < .001); theuninsured rate decreased to a lesser degree for patients with breast cancer (2.7%in 2011 to 2013 to 1.6% in 2014; P < .001). This decrease in the rate ofuninsured patients was absent in patients living in nonexpansion states.CONCLUSION: The ACA resulted in expanded insurance coverage for patientsdiagnosed with colon, lung, and breast cancer. However, the impact was onlyobserved in states that increased their Medicaid eligibility.DOI: 10.1200/JOP.2017.027102 PMID: 29436303
