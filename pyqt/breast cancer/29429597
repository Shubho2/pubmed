Our analysis focused on the seven most prevalenthistologic types. Differences were compared between invasive carcinoma of nospecial type (NST) and the other six types.RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in age at diagnosis, tumor grade, size, nodal status and treatment. As tumor size increased, the number of positivelymph nodes increased markedly in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and mixed NST and lobular carcinoma (NST-ILC), while in metaplastic carcinoma the number onlyincreased slightly. In multivariate survival analyses, compared with patientswith invasive carcinoma NST, breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overallsurvival (OS) were worse for those with NST-ILC (BCSS: hazard ratio [HR] 1.81,P < .001; OS: HR 1.56, P = .005) or metaplastic carcinoma (BCSS: HR 1.95,P < .001; OS: HR 1.73, P < .001). By contrast, patients with medullary (HR 0.40, P = .010) or apocrine carcinoma (HR 0.27, P = .008) showed better BCSS.Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses indicated that T category in ILC and N category in metaplastic carcinoma were of less prognosticvalue.CONCLUSIONS: According to the histologic classification of TNBC, thisheterogeneous disease can be divided into several entities with differentclinicopathologic features and prognoses. In the era of molecular subtyping ofbreast cancer, the histologic classification of TNBC is still of considerableclinical significance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
