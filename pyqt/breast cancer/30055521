Electronic address: mokhtar.desouki@vanderbilt.edu.Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is a procedure to reduce the risk ofadnexal cancer in BRCA mutation carriers and for hormonal manipulation in womenwith breast cancer (BC). The goal of the study is to report the frequency ofsubsequent BC and high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) following RRSO in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and in patients with personal history of BC with orwithout BRCA mutation. A series of 147 consecutive patients who received a RRSOwere reviewed. Patient's age, clinical history, BC histotype, gene mutation data,incidence of post-RRSO BC and HGSC and time intervals were analyzed. The caseswere followed for a mean of 49 months. Group 1 consists of 97 cases withpathogenic or likely pathogenic "deleterious" mutation BRCA1 (n = 49) or BRCA2(n = 48). Group 2 consists of 50 cases with history of BC and no documented BRCA gene mutation. Prior to RRSO, 42 (43%) cases in group 1 had a history of BC andall cases in group 2 had a history of BC. There was no difference between thegroups in the age at diagnosis for BC (Mean of 44 years). Following RRSO, 2/49cases (4%) with BRCA1 mutation were found to have occult HGSC and none in BRCA2cases. There were also 1 BC recurrence and 1 primary BC with BRCA1 mutationcompared to 5 recurrent BC in Group 2 (10%). In conclusion, the risk ofsubsequent recurrent BC after RRSO appears to be higher (10%) in patients withhistory of BC with no BRCA mutation when compared to (2%) in BRCA mutationcarriers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
