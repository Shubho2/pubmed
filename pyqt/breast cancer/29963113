However, there has been no external validation of theprognostic value of the new stages with different population-based databases.Methods: To validate the prognostic value of the new staging system in the Asian population, with a focus on Korean patients with breast cancer, we performed aretrospective study with data from the Korean Breast Cancer Society that included24,014 patients with invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma who underwent surgerybetween January 2009 and January 2012 in Korea. The proportional differences wereevaluated between the anatomic staging system (AJCC 7th edition) and theprognostic staging system (AJCC 8th edition, December 2017 published version).Comparisons of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) withKaplan-Meier graphs and hazard ratios were also performed.Results: Our analysis included 24,014 patients (median age, 50 years; range,20-91 years). Stage I, II, and III disease accounted for 47.6%, 43.5%, and 8.9%, respectively, of anatomic stages and 61.8%, 27.6%, and 10.8%, respectively, ofclinical prognostic stages. A total of 6,272 cases (26.1%) were upstaged, 4,656(19.4%) were downstaged, and 13,086 (54.5%) remained unchanged. OS and DFSdecreased in the order from prognostic stages IA to IIIC but did not change amongthe anatomic stage groups.Conclusion: Our data suggests that the prognostic staging system providessuperior prognostic value to the anatomic staging system in Korean patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.173 PMCID: PMC6015977PMID: 29963113
