A multidisciplinary workgroup discussed genetic susceptibility,pathophysiology and clinical management of hereditary LBC (HLBC). The team hasestablished the clinical criteria for CDH1 screening and results' interpretation,and created consensus guidelines regarding genetic counselling, breastsurveillance and imaging techniques, clinicopathological findings, psychological and decisional support, as well as prophylactic surgery and plasticreconstruction. Based on a review of current evidence for the identification ofHLBC cases/families, CDH1 genetic testing is recommended in patients fulfillingthe following criteria: (A) bilateral LBC with or without family history of LBC, with age at onset <50 years, and (B) unilateral LBC with family history of LBC,with age at onset <45 years. In CDH1 asymptomatic mutant carriers, breastsurveillance with clinical examination, yearly mammography, contrast-enhancedbreast MRI and breast ultrasonography (US) with 6-month interval between the USand the MRI should be implemented as a first approach. In selected cases withpersonal history, family history of LBC and CDH1 mutations, prophylacticmastectomy could be discussed with an integrative group of clinical experts.Psychodecisional support also plays a pivotal role in the management ofindividuals with or without CDH1 germline alterations. Ultimately, the definitionof a specific protocol for CDH1 genetic screening and ongoing coordinatedmanagement of patients with HLBC is crucial for the effective surveillance andearly detection of LBC.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
