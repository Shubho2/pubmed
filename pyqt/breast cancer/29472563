Despite the well-known immunologic benefits thatfebrile hyperthermia can induce, an investigation of how RFT could modulate theintra-tumoral immune microenvironment had not been studied. Thus, using anestablished 4T1 breast cancer model in immune competent mice, we demonstrate thatRFT induces a transient, localized, and T-cell dependent intratumoralinflammatory response. More specifically we show that multi- and singlet-dose RFTpromote an increase in tumor volume in immune competent Balb/c mice, which doesnot occur in athymic nude models. Further leukocyte subset analysis at 24, 48,and 120 hours after a single RFT show a rapid increase in tumoral trafficking of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells 24 hours post-treatment. Additional serum cytokine analysisreveals an increase in numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokinesassociated with enhanced T-cell trafficking. Overall, these data demonstrate thatnon-invasive RFT could be an effective immunomodulatory strategy in solid tumors,especially for enhancing the tumoral trafficking of lymphocytes, which iscurrently a major hindrance of numerous cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-21719-w PMCID: PMC5823899PMID: 29472563
