Electronic address: boh@sdu.edu.cn.Breast cancer (BC) is among the most common malignant diseases and metastasis is the handcuff of treatment. Cancer metastasis is a multistep process associatedwith the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. Several studies havedemonstrated that transcriptional repressor GATA binding 1 (TRPS1) playedimportant roles in development and progression of primary BC. In this study wesought to identify the mechanisms responsible for this function of TRPS1 in thecontinuum of the metastatic cascade. Here we described that TRPS1 wassignificantly associated with BC metastasis using public assessable datasets.Clinically, loss of TRPS1 expression in BC was related to higher histologicalgrade. In vitro functional study and bioinformatics analysis revealed that TRPS1 inhibited cell migration and EMT in BC. Importantly, we identified SUZ12 as anovel target of TRPS1 related to EMT program. ChIP assay demonstrated TRPS1directly inhibited SUZ12 transcription by binding to the SUZ12 promoter. Loss of TRPS1 resulted in increased SUZ12 binding and H3K27 tri-methylation at the CDH1promoter and repression of E-cadherin. In all, our data indicated that TRPS1maintained the expression of E-cadherin by inhibiting SUZ12, which might provide novel insight into how loss of TRPS1 contributed to BC progression.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
