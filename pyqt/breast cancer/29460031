IORT was appliedwith electrons following lumpectomy (23.3 Gy). EB-APBI was delivered using 3D-CRTor IMRT in 10 daily fractions of 3.85 Gy within 6 weeks after surgery. Acutetoxicity was scored using the CTCAE v3.0 at 3 months after treatment.Patient-reported symptoms were analyzed using visual analogue scales (VAS) forpain and fatigue (scale 0-10), and single items from the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BreastCancer questionnaires.RESULTS: In total, 267 (IORT) and 206 (EB-APBI) patients were available fortoxicity analysis. More patients experienced ≥ grade 2 CTCAE acute toxicity inthe IORT group (10.4% IORT and 4.9% EB-APBI; p = 0.03); grade 3 toxicity was low (3.3% IORT and 1.5% EB-APBI; ns); and no grade 4 toxicity occurred. EB-APBIpatients experienced less fatigue direct postoperatively (EORTC p < 0.00, VASp < 0.00). After 3 months only pain, according to the VAS scale, wassignificantly worse in the EB-APBI group (p < 0.00).CONCLUSION: Acute toxicity after IORT and EB-APBI treatment is acceptable.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4712-3 PMCID: PMC5953978PMID: 29460031
