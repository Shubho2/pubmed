Owing to significant advancements in information technology (IT) andgenomics, clinicians are increasingly attaining therapeutic goals rapidly andsafely by effectively differentiating patient subsets that require chemotherapy. IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO) is a cognitive computing system employed byclinicians to provide evidence-based treatment options for cancer. WFO aids inclinical diagnosis, with claims that it may be superior in performance to humanclinicians. The current study was based on the hypothesis that WFO alone cannoteffectively determine whether or not chemotherapy is essential for the subset of ER-positive, HER2-negative BC patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From December 2015 to July 2017, 95 patients withER-positive, HER2- negative BC subjected to treatment were retrospectivelyexamined using WFO, and outputs compared to real clinical practice. Treatmentoptions were suggested by WFO, and WFO recommendations calculated both with andwithout data from the gene expression assay (GEA).RESULTS: WFO without GEA was unable to determine the groups of patients that did not require chemotherapy. Concordant therapeutic recommendations between realclinical practice and WFO without GEA were obtained for 23.2% of the patientgroup. On the other hand, the results of WFO with GEA showed good clinicalapplicability. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negativepredictive values of WFO with GEA were 100%, 80%, 61% and 100%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our collective findings indicate that WFO without the geneexpression assay has limited clinical utility.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200100 PMCID: PMC6034851PMID: 29979736
