In this population-basedcase-case study, we evaluated the association between alcohol, smoking, and risk of H2E and TN breast cancer, compared with ER+ breast cancers, among women aged20-69 years. Using polytomous regression, associations between alcoholconsumption, smoking, and breast cancer risk were evaluated in 909 ER+, 1,290 TN,and 489 H2E breast cancer patients, with ER+ breast cancer patients as thereference group. Current alcohol consumption at diagnosis was associated with alower risk of H2E breast cancer (odds ratio = 0.74, 95% confidence interval:0.58-0.92) relative to ER+ cancers. No difference in association was observed by menopausal status. No association between alcohol consumption and TN breastcancer relative to ER+ breast cancer was observed. Women who smoked did not have an altered risk of TN or H2E breast cancer, relative to ER+ cancer. Our resultssuggest that alcohol is associated with lower risk of H2E breast cancer relative to ER+ breast cancer. This study adds to the body of epidemiologic evidence that breast cancer etiology differs by breast cancer subtype.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31575 PMID: 29708591
