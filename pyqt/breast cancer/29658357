Using a large set ofclinical data, we analyzed the number of sensors required to adequately monitorskin temperature during superficial hyperthermia treatment of breast cancerpatients.METHODS: Hyperthermia treatments monitored with >60 stationary temperaturesensors were selected from a database of patients with recurrent breast cancertreated with re-irradiation (23 × 2 Gy) and hyperthermia using single 434 MHzapplicators (effective field size 351-396 cm2). Reduced temperature monitoringschemes involved randomly selected subsets of stationary skin sensors, andanother subset simulating continuous thermal mapping of the skin. Temperaturedifferences (ΔT) between subsets and complete sets of sensors were evaluated interms of overall minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax) temperature, as well as T90and T10.RESULTS: Eighty patients were included yielding a total of 400 hyperthermiasessions. Median ΔT was <0.01 °C for T90, its 95% confidence interval (95%CI)decreased to ≤0.5 °C when >50 sensors were used. Subsets of <10 sensors result inunderestimation of Tmax up to -2.1 °C (ΔT 95%CI), which decreased to -0.5 °Cwhen >50 sensors were used. Thermal profiles (8-21 probes) yielded a medianΔT < 0.01 °C for T90 and Tmax, with a 95%CI of -0.2 °C and 0.4 °C, respectively. The detection rate of Tmax ≥43 °C is ≥85% while using >50 stationary sensors orthermal profiles.CONCLUSIONS: Adequate coverage of the skin temperature distribution duringsuperficial hyperthermia treatment requires the use of >50 stationary sensors per400 cm2 applicator. Thermal mapping is a valid alternative.DOI: 10.1080/02656736.2018.1466000 PMID: 29658357
