Fruit/vegetable intake (F/V), % calories from fat, and hypothesized psychosocial mediators were assessedat baseline, 6 and 12 months. Analysis of covariance assessed interventioneffects on psychosocial mediators at 6 and 12 months. Mediation analysis usingthe bootstrap method evaluated the indirect intervention effects on dietaryintake at 6 and 12 months through changes in psychosocial mediators at 6 and12 months.RESULTS: Compared with controls, at 6 and 12 months, the intervention groupreported greater improvements in stages of change (P < .001, P < .001,respectively), self-efficacy (P = .009, P = .002, respectively), snack preferencefor F/snack preference for F/V (P = .045, P = .002, respectively); at 12 months, the intervention group reported a decrease in chance-oriented external locus ofcontrol (P = .02). At 6 months, mediation analysis showed that the interventioneffect was associated with an increase of 1.0 (95% CI, -0.1-2.4) serving/day ofF/V, compared with the control group, although no indirect effect through thehypothesized psychosocial mediators was observed. At 12 months, the intervention was associated with an increase in 0.5 serving/day F/V through improvedtaste/snack preference for F/V at 6 and 12 months (95% CIs, 0.1-1.3, 0.0-1.4,respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Future programs can target improving taste/snack preference for F/V to promote dietary change in Hispanic/Latina breast cancer survivors.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4799 PMID: 29904989
