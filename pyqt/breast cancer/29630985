Electronic address:gaohuile@scu.edu.cn.The size of nanoparticles plays a key role in utilizing enhanced permeability andretention (EPR) effect of tumor, where large-sized nanoparticles possess goodretention but poor penetration, while small-sized nanoparticles are on thecontrary. Although size-reducible nanoparticles have been designed to partiallyovercome this dilemma, the initial size and complicated tumor microenvironmentremain restricting the tumor distribution of nanoparticles. Herein, we employedtumor-specific CD44 targeted, hyaluronidase-degradable hyaluronic acid (HA) andsmall-sized, renal-clearable, red emission, cationic bovine serumalbumin-protected gold nanocluster (AuNC@CBSA) to successfully constructsize-reducible nanoplatform (AuNC@CBSA@HA). By changing the ratio of HA andAuNC@CBSA, different initial sizes of AuNC@CBSA@HA were prepared and their tumor targeting efficiencies, pharmacokinetic profiles were evaluated. Then 200 nm ofAuNC@CBSA@HA with optimal EPR effect was screened out to further load paclitaxel (PTX) and indocyanine green (ICG) for chemo- photothermal therapy and nitricoxide (NO) for modulating tumor microenvironment and enhancing drug delivery. TheAuNC@CBSA-PTX-ICG@HA-NO3 showed size-reducible ability under triggering byhyaluronidase and high accumulation in breast cancer with homogenous intra-tumor distribution, suppressed 95.3% of in-situ tumor growth and inhibited 88.4% oflung metastasis growth. In conclusion, we provide a strategy that fully satisfiedthe concerns in drug delivery to tumor for improved antitumor effect.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
