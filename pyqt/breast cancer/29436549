However, conventional nanoparticle platforms are not so effective in terms of the selectivity and transfection efficiency. In this study, we designed and developed a dual-target drug/gene delivery system based on lipid-coatedcalcium phosphate (LCP) nanoparticles (NPs) for significantly enhanced siRNAcellular uptake and transfection efficiency. LCP NPs loaded with therapeuticsiRNA were conjugated with a controlled number of folic acid and/or EGFR-specificsingle chain fragment antibody (ABX-EGF scFv). The uptake of ABX-EGFscFv-modified (LCP-scFv) and folic acid-modified LCP NPs (LCP-FA) by human breasttumor cells (MDA-MB-468) was significantly higher with an optimal ligand density on each NP surface (LCP-125scFv and LCP-100FA). Co-conjugation with sub-optimaldual ligands (50 FA and 75 ABX-EGF scFv) per LCP NP (LCP-50FA-75scFv) furtherenhanced the cellular uptake. More significantly, much more NPs were delivered tothe MDA-MB-468 tumor tissue in the nude mouse model when LCP-50FA-75scFv NPs wereused. Therefore, the new dual-ligand LCP NPs may be a valuable targeting systemfor human breast cancer diagnosis and therapy.DOI: 10.1039/c7nr08644j PMID: 29436549
