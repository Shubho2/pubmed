Some patients experience a severe form of mTORinhibitor-associated stomatitis (mIAS) that can have a negative effect onnutritional status, compromise quality of life, and potentially lead tononadherence, reducing the efficacy of cancer therapy.OBJECTIVES: This article aims to address an unmet need for education about mIASamong oncology nurses and patients and to share findings about everolimus-relatedstomatitis from the SWISH trial.METHODS: The authors reviewed the literature on mIAS and selected a case seriesof experiences to illustrate successes and clinical challenges that an oncologynurse might encounter when caring for patients with advanced breast cancer whomay develop everolimus-related stomatitis.FINDINGS: Recommendations are provided for oncology nurses to educate patients onprevention, early detection, monitoring, and management strategies to mitigatethe incidence and severity of everolimus-related stomatitis.DOI: 10.1188/18.CJON.211-217 PMID: 29547614
