China.Engineering malignant cells to express a heterologous α-gal antigen can induceheterograft hyperacute rejection, resulting in complement-dependent cytolysis(CDC) of tumor cells, which has been considered as a novel strategy for antitumortherapy. A549 cells engineered to express Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R (α-gal) epitope exhibited strong resistance to CDC treated by normal human serum (NHS) in aprevious study. We hypothesized that the expression of membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs) decay accelerating factor (CD55) and protectin (CD59)influenced the efficacy of the α-gal/NHS-mediated antitumor effect to tumor cellsin vitro. The present study confirmed that A549 cells expressed high levels ofCD55 and CD59, whereas Lovo cells expressed relatively low levels of theseproteins. A549 and Lovo cells transfected with plasmids containing or lacking theα-gal epitope were evaluated for their susceptibility to CDC by NHS and detected using a trypan blue exclusion assay. α-gal-expressing Lovo (Lovo-GT) cells werealmost completely killed by α-gal-mediated CDC following incubation with 50% NHS,whereas no cytolysis was observed in α-gal expressing A549 (A549-GT) cells.Abrogating CD55 and CD59 function from A549-GT cells by various concentrations ofphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) or blocking antibodiesincreased the susceptibility of cells to CDC, and the survival rate decreasedsignificantly comparing to the controls (P<0.05). The findings of the presentstudy indicated that using the α-gal/NHS system to eliminate tumor cells viainducing the complement cascade reaction might represent a feasible approach for the treatment of cancer. However, high levels of mCRP expression may limit theefficacy of this approach. Therefore, an improved efficacy of cancer cell killingmay be achieved by combining strategies of heterologous α-gal expression and mCRPdownregulation.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8478 PMCID: PMC5958734PMID: 29805637
