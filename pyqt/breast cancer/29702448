Electronic address: dr.nadiaelgohary@yahoo.com.(2)Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University,Mansoura, 35516, Egypt.New pyrazolopyridine analogs were prepared and tested for antimicrobial efficacy toward Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonasaeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus.Results revealed that compound 6 has prominent and broad spectrum antimicrobialactivity. Compound 8 showed good antibacterial efficacy over the four testedbacterial strains. In addition, compounds 2-4 displayed interesting efficacy overS. aureus, B. cereus and P. aeruginosa as well as moderate efficacy towardE. coli, C. albicans, A. fumigatus and A. flavus. Furthermore, compounds 9 and 10exhibited interesting efficacy over P. aeruginosa. Antiquorum-sensing efficacy ofthe same analogs toward Chromobacterium violaceum was also examined, whereascompounds 3, 4 and 6 displayed acceptable activity. In vitro antitumor assay ofthe new pyrazolopyridines toward liver (HepG2), breast (MCF-7) and cervix (Hela) cancer cells illustrated that compounds 2 and 5 have the highest antitumoractivity over the three cell lines. Moreover, compound 4 exhibited interestingefficacy on all tested cell lines, whereas compound 7 showed good activity onMCF-7 cells. The most active in vitro antitumor analogs, 2, 4, 5 and 7 wereassessed for in vivo antitumor efficacy on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells,whereas compound 5 displayed the highest efficacy. In addition, cytotoxicitytesting toward W138 and WISH normal cells revealed that all tested analogs areless cytotoxic than doxorubicin. The new analogs were evaluated for DNA-bindingaffinity, whereas compounds 2, 4 and 5 displayed the highest affinity. In silico studies concluded that all the new pyrazolopyridines are foreseen to haveexcellent oral absorption.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
