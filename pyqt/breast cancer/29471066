As many oncological patients are diabetics, it is important todetermine the influence of this chronic disease on the pharmacokinetics (PK) ofanticancer drugs. Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), approved forthe treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positivemetastatic breast cancer. The aim of the study was to compare the PK of lapatinibin normal and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model rats. Additionally, theeffect of lapatinib on blood glucose concentrations was examined.METHODS: The PK of lapatinib was studied in healthy rats (n=6, the healthy group)and T2DM model rats (n=6, the diabetic group). The rats received lapatinib orallyas a single dose of 50mg. Plasma concentrations of lapatinib were measured withhigh-performance liquid chromatography method coupled with a tandem massspectrometry.RESULTS: The plasma concentrations of lapatinib were increased in the T2DM model rats. There were statistically significant differences between the groups in Cmax(p=0.0104) and AUC0-t (p=0.0265). The reduction of glycaemia in the range of1.2-41.5% and in the range of 4.1-36.8% was observed in the diabetic and healthy animals, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Higher concentrations of lapatinib in the diabetic rats may suggest the need for application of lower doses of this TKI in patients with DM.Copyright © 2017.
