China.Go-Ichi-Ni-San 2 (GINS2), also known as partner of Sld five 2, is involved in theinitiation of DNA replication and cell cycle progression. GINS2 is abundantlyexpressed in a number of malignant solid tumors, including breast cancer,melanoma and hepatic carcinoma. However, the functions of GINS2 in epithelialovarian cancer (EOC) remain unclear. The aim of the present study was toinvestigate these functions. GINS2 expression was detected in EOC and normalovarian tissues using immunohistochemistry. To investigate the functions of GINS2in EOC, GINS2 expression was stably knocked down in SKOV-3 cells using lentiviralshort hairpin RNA (shRNA). The expression of GINS2 mRNA and protein in SKOV-3cells was examined using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chainreaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analyses, respectively. Cell proliferationwas determined using high-content screening and MTT assays. Cell cycleprogression and apoptosis were detected using flow cytometry. Compared withnormal ovarian tissues, EOC tissues expressed increased levels of GINS2expression (16.7 vs. 58.3%). Increased expression of GINS2 mRNA was also observedin SKOV-3 and OVCAR3 cells. In the investigation of GINS2 functions in EOC, GINS2expression at the mRNA and protein levels was significantly inhibited by specificGINS2 shRNA. GINS2 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation andviability of SKOV-3 cells and induced cell cycle arrest in S phase. Furthermore, GINS2 knockdown in SKOV-3 cells significantly increased cell apoptosis. GINS2 is markedly expressed in EOC tissues and cell lines. Stable GINS2 knockdown inSKOV-3 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cyclearrest and cell apoptosis. Therefore, GINS2 may be involved in EOC progression.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8944 PMCID: PMC6036576PMID: 30013653
