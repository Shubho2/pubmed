In the present study, Cox multivariate regression of the relative mRNA expression levels in two microarray-based datasets (GSE17005 and GSE26971) wasemployed to develop a risk score model to evaluate the outcome of patients withBRCA in the GSE17005 dataset. A total of ten genes were used to develop theprediction model for the survival of tamoxifen-treated patients with breastcancer. The survival time of patients in the low risk score group wassignificantly longer compared with patients in the high risk score group. Thisobservation was validated in three other datasets (GSE26971, GSE22219 andGSE56884). The prognostic effect of the clinicopathological indicators and therisk score were tested with the 5-year event receiving operating characteristiccurve, and the risk score had an improved prognostic value in patients withER+-BRCA with an area under the curve value of 0.733 compared with the factors ofage, tumor stage, tumor grade, chemotherapy, lymph invasion and tumor size. Therisk score was significantly associated with the tumor-node-metastasis stage and grade, but was independent of age, sex, lymph invasion and tumor size. Insummary, the risk model for breast cancer using the expression signature of tengenes may be an important indicator for predicting the survival of patients with ER+-breast cancer and treated with tamoxifen.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8663 PMCID: PMC6006464PMID: 29928444
