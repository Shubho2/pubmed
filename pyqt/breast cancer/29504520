Prognostic and predictive factors in MBC are extrapoled from trials conducted on its female counterpart.OBJECTIVE: Since the relationship between the transcription factor Forkhead boxM1 (FOXM1) expression and the clinical response to chemotherapy andhormonotherapy in MBC remains unknown, we sought to investigate the predictivevalue of FOXM1 in MBC.METHODS: FOXM1 expression was assessed in 130 MBC cases. Clinical significancewas analyzed by Kaplan Meier curves, log-rank test and multivariate Coxregression analyses.RESULTS: Patients with high FOXM1 expression had a significantly lower responserate to chemotherapy (P = 0.045) and hormonotherapy (P = 0.029) than those withlow FOXM1 expression. Multivariate analyses indicated that FOXM1 was anindependent prognostic factor for disease free survival in MBC patients (P <0.001).CONCLUSIONS: FOXM1 may have a reliable predictive significance in male breastcancer and thus may become an important target for male breast cancer therapy in the near future.DOI: 10.3233/BD-170315 PMID: 29504520
