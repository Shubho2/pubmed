We found 3 cases with clinical complete response (cCR) of the bonemetastasis and longer overall survival of the retrospectively examined cohorttreated comprehensively including autologous formalin-fixed tumor vaccine (AFTV).Patients and Methods: AFTV was prepared individually for each patient from their own formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues.Results: Three patients maintained cCR status of the bone metastasis for 17months or more. Rate of cCR for 1 year or more appeared to be 15% (3/20) aftercomprehensive treatments including AFTV. The median overall survival time (60.0months) and the 3- to 8-year survival rates after diagnosis of bone metastasiswere greater than those of historical control cohorts in Japan (1988-2002) and inthe nationwide population-based cohort study of Denmark (1999-2007).Conclusion: Bone-metastatic breast cancer may be curable after comprehensivetreatments including AFTV, although larger scale clinical trial is required.DOI: 10.1155/2018/4879406 PMCID: PMC5822812PMID: 29576883
