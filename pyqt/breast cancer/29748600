Reagents thatcan distinguish between caspases, particularly apical caspases-8, 9, and 10 arescarce and generally nonspecific. Based upon a previously described large-scalescreen of peptide-based caspase substrates termed HyCoSuL, we sought to developreagents to distinguish between apical caspases in order to reveal their functionin apoptotic cell death paradigms. To this end, we selected tetrapeptide-basedsequences that deliver optimal substrate selectivity and converted them toinhibitors equipped with a detectable tag (activity-based probes-ABPs). Wedemonstrate a strong relationship between substrate kinetics and ABP kinetics. Toevaluate the utility of selective substrates and ABPs, we examined distinctapoptosis pathways in Jurkat T lymphocyte and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer linestriggered to undergo cell death via extrinsic or intrinsic apoptosis. We reportthe first highly selective substrate appropriate for quantitation of caspase-8activity during apoptosis. Converting substrates to ABPs promotedloss-of-activity and selectivity, thus we could not define a single ABP capableof detecting individual apical caspases in complex mixtures. To overcome this, wedeveloped a panel strategy utilizing several caspase-selective ABPs tointerrogate apoptosis, revealing the first chemistry-based approach to uncoverthe participation of caspase-8, but not caspase-9 or -10 in TRAIL-inducedextrinsic apoptosis. We propose that using select panels of ABPs can provideinformation regarding caspase-8 apoptotic signaling more faithfully than cansingle, generally nonspecific reagents.DOI: 10.1038/s41418-018-0110-y PMID: 29748600
