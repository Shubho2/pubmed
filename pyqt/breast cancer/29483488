Moreover, the effects oflactoferrin were more pronounced in receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 andMDA-MB-468 cells. These changes resulted in increased expression of proapoptotic Bax protein (p < 0.05), reduced expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein (p < 0.05) and level of not-oxidized mitochondrial cardiolipin (1.4-1.7-fold, p <0.05). This, in turn, caused an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells (by14-24%, p < 0.05). Cytotoxic effects of lactoferrin were accompanied by anincrease in the percentage of DNA in the comet tail and blocking cell cycle atG2/M phase, especially in receptor-negative cell lines.CONCLUSION: The study showed that exogenous lactoferrin causes a violation of an antioxidant balance by increasing the level of ROS, "free" iron and NO generationrate, resalting in the blocking of cell cycle at G2/M-phase and apoptosis ofmalignant cells.PMID: 29483488
