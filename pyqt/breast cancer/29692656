Despite radiotherapy, chemotherapy andsurgical treatment, the survival rate of patients with advanced disease is low.Metastasis is one of the stages of cancerogenesis in which tumour cells acquirethe ability to migrate and create tumour secondary foci. Tumour biomarkers,proteins produced by neoplastic cells, quantified in body fluids or in tissues,play a key role in treatment monitoring and in determining the prognosis forfurther years of life. In recent years, the search for cervical cancer biomarkershas been intensively sought. They can become a decisive factor in making radical treatment and, in the near future, a potential therapeutic goal. The articlepresents and briefly describes the biomarkers of metastasis in cervical cancerstudied in recent years and highlights their potential therapeutic use.DOI: 10.5114/wo.2018.74386 PMCID: PMC5909723PMID: 29692656
