However, the functions of LRH1 in mediating cancer cellschemoresistance are still not clear. Here, we found LRH1 levels weresignificantly elevated in primary breast cancer tissues in patients who developedearly recurrence. Similarly, adriamycin (ADR)-resistant breast cancer cell lines also exerted high LRH1 expression. Indeed, overexpression of LRH1 attenuatedcytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs ADR and cisplatin (DDP) in breast cancercells in vitro and in nude mice tumor model. Comet and BrdU assays showedoverexpression of LRH1 blocked breast cancer cells DNA damage by chemotherapeuticdrug, whereas depletion of LRH1 enhanced DNA damage. Remarkably, knockdown ofLRH1 decreased the levels and foci of DNA damage marker γH2AX induced by ADR and DDP. Furthermore, plasmid end-joining assay indicated that knockdown of LRH1significantly decreased non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated double-strand break (DSB) repair efficiencies. Afterwards, we provided evidences that LRH1promoted MDC1 transcription by directly activating MDC1 promoter and thereforeincreased γH2AX levels. Importantly, a LRH1-binding site mapped between -1812 and-1804 bp of the proximal MDC1 promoter was identified. Moreover, LRH1 and MDC1mRNA levels were positively correlated in recurrent breast cancer samples. These results implied LRH1 enhanced breast cancer cell chemoresistance by upregulating MDC1 and attenuating DNA damage. Additionally, we elucidated the coactivatorNCOA3 acted synergistically with LRH1 to promote MDC1 expression andchemoresistance. Altogether, LRH1-MDC1 signaling might be considered as a novelmolecular target for designing novel therapeutic regimen in chemotherapyresistance breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0193-4 PMID: 29545602
