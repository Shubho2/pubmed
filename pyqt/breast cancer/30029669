Thus, we compared the postoperativechanges in HRQoL in breast cancer survivors with those of age-matched generalpopulation groups using the EuroQoL five-dimension three-level questionnaire(EQ-5D-3 L).METHODS: EQ-5D-3 L questionnaires were obtained from 686 breast cancer survivors during follow-up visits. They were divided into five groups according to timeafter surgery: 0-5 months, 6-11 months, 12-35 months, 36-59 months,and ≥ 60 months. Their EQ-5D-3 L data, covering five dimensions (mobility,self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), werecompared with those of age-matched general population groups.RESULTS: The mean EQ-5D-3 L index of breast cancer survivors was high in groupwith longer time after surgery and the mean EQ-5D-3 L index of breast cancergroup over 5 years after surgery was similar to that of an age-matched generalpopulation (0.919 vs 0.928, p = 0.305). Although there were deficits in alldimensions of breast cancer survivors, motility eventually exceeded that ofgeneral population groups and self-care and usual activities of groups over3 years after surgery matched those of general population however,pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression of survivors over 5 years after surgeryremained worse than those of the general population (p = 0.028, p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Motility, self-care, and usual activities decreased in the earlypostoperative period for breast cancer survivors but showed recovery after3 years. However, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression remained poorer in thesepatients than in the general population for many years.DOI: 10.1186/s12955-018-0965-0 PMCID: PMC6053733PMID: 30029669
