[Epub ahead of print]KIAA0101 inhibition suppresses cell proliferation and cell cycle progression bypromoting the interaction between p53 and Sp1 in breast cancer.Lv W(1), Su B(2), Li Y(1), Geng C(1), Chen N(3).Author information: (1)Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Shandong Provincial HospitalAffiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, PR China.(2)Department of Medical Engineering, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, PR China.(3)Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, PR China. Electronic address: nachen1982@126.com.KIAA0101 functions as a regulator of centrosome number in breast cancer. Here, weidentify the role of KIAA0101 in breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. KIAA0101 knockdown significantly inhibited cell growth, colonyformation and G1/S phase transition. Further investigation indicated thatKIAA0101 silencing suppressed the expression of CCNE2, CDK6 and CDKN1A.Luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay demonstrated that Sp1 positivelyregulated the transcription of CCNE2, CDK6 and CDKN1A. KIAA0101 knockdownpromoted the interaction between p53 and Sp1, inhibiting the transcriptionalactivation of Sp1 on CCNE2, CDK6 and CDKN1A. Knockdown of p53 counteracted theinhibitory effect of KIAA0101 knockdown on breast cancer cells proliferation and cell cycle progression while Sp1 knockdown mimicked the effect of KIAA0101knockdown. These results suggested that KIAA0101 knockdown suppressed the cellproliferation and cell cycle progression by promoting the formation of p53/Sp1complex in breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018.
