[Epub ahead of print]FDG avid internal mammary lymphadenopathy and implant rupture in PET/CT unveilingclinically unsuspected silicone granuloma in treated breast cancer.Palot Manzil FF(1), Bhambhvani P(2).Author information: (1)Weill Cornell Medicine, Qatar.(2)The University of Alabama at Birmingham, United States.Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) uptake in enlarged lymph nodes isalways suspicious, especially in cancer patients. We report a case ofhypermetabolic internal mammary lymphadenopathy in a breast cancer patient whowas previously treated with bilateral mastectomy and implants. The abnormal nodaluptake turned out to be due to foreign body induced inflammation, confirmed onhistopathology. Vigilant PET interpretation is required in breast cancer patientswith evidence of breast implant rupture.Copyright Â© 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.DOI: 10.2967/jnmt.118.211979 PMID: 30076249
