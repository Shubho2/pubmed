Micromorphometriccharacteristics included follicular center count (FCC)/profile, sinushistiocytosis, metastatic size, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (intranodal),paracortical dendritic cells, germinal center reaction and morphology. Comparisonof Kaplan-Meier survival curves used the exact log-rank statistic.RESULTS: In the high-FCC (n = 5-51) vs the low-FCC (n < 5) lymph nodes, a delayedseparation occurred at 3 years, with 5-year OS rates being 73% vs 54% in thehigh- and low-FCC groups, respectively. Improved survival up to 3 years was also noted in CLDs that showed a higher FCC when compared to the prior SLN. Patientswith metastatic deposits >2 mm had significantly lower 5-year survival (both<.001).CONCLUSIONS: Nodal micromorphometric features (ie, FCC) are probably related tohost immune response to metastasis. Quantitative evaluation of lymphoidfollicular centers could provide valuable prognostic information to help tostratify patients.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
