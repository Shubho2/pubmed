Triple-negative breastcancer (TNBC) is the most immunogenic breast cancer subtype, and there is strong evidence that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in TNBC have prognostic value andare associated with clinical outcome and improved survival. Evading antitumorimmunity is a hallmark for the development and progression of cancer.Immunotherapy studies have focused on the role of the programmed cell death-1(PD-1) receptor/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway in maintainingimmunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has emerged as a promising therapeutic option to enhance antitumor immunity andis actively being investigated in TNBC, with encouraging results. In thisarticle, the authors review the current literature on checkpoint inhibitors inTNBC with a focus on PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and discuss combination strategies andnovel approaches for improving antitumor immunity and clinical outcome.
