BC screening rates(64%) are below the national rates (81.1%). This article explores VAW's beliefsabout BC and screening.METHOD: Using community-based participatory qualitative descriptive methods, 40VAW were recruited from Oregon, and four focus groups were conducted. A directed content analysis was used.RESULTS: Main themes were as follows: deferred to a health care provider orrelying on self-detection and symptoms; fear of BC versus fear of proceduralpain; limited knowledge; motivation by observing others' journey in BC death orsurvivorship; body image concern; "living carefree," "good fortune-having goodhealth"; and coverage for a mammogram expense means health care access.DISCUSSION: Tailored interventions should address mammogram knowledge, fear,erroneous information, body image, fate and luck, and promoting access.DOI: 10.1177/1043659618764570 PMID: 29577818
