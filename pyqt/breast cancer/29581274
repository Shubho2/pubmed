Here, we identify TDP43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) as an importantsplicing regulator responsible for the unique splicing profile in triple-negativebreast cancer (TNBC). Clinical data demonstrate that TDP43 is highly expressed inTNBC with poor prognosis. Knockdown of TDP43 inhibits tumor progression,including proliferation and metastasis, and overexpression of TDP43 promotesproliferation and malignancy of mammary epithelial cells. Deep sequencinganalysis and functional experiments indicate that TDP43 alters most splicingevents with splicing factor SRSF3 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3), inthe regulation of TNBC progression. The TDP43/SRSF3 complex controls specificsplicing events, including downstream genes PAR3 and NUMB The effect of reducedmetastasis and proliferation upon the knockdown of TDP43 or SRSF3 is mediated by the splicing regulation of PAR3 and NUMB exon 12, respectively. The TDP43/SRSF3complex and downstream PAR3 isoform are potential therapeutic targets for TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018 the Author(s).
