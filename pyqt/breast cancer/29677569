Survival distributions for the different staging systems wereestimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank tests.Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used, with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Harrell's Concordance Index (C-index) to compare both stagingsystems. Among patients with positive hormone-receptor status, 84.8% receivedendocrine therapy. Among the cohort, 60.3% of received chemotherapy; 82.1% ofnode positive patients received chemotherapy and 86.0% of HER2-enriched patients in whom chemotherapy was also indicated received adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy. Ninety-seven percent of patients received anthracyclines and/or taxanescontaining chemotherapy regime.RESULTS: The median follow up was 64 months. 2921 patients (46.5%) werediscordant between the anatomic and prognostic systems of which 363 (5.8%) wereupstaged and 2558 (40.7%) were down-staged. For all patients, stages in both the prognostic and anatomic systems were discriminating for 5-year CSS. Controllingfor age, ethnicity and receipt of chemotherapy, the prognostic staging systemmodel (AIC = 7538.87, C = 0.79) presented slightly better explanation andconcordance of survival times than the anatomic staging system model(AIC = 7607.31, C = 0.77).CONCLUSION: The prognostic staging system was better than the anatomic stagingsystem in predicting outcomes but the anatomic system remains relevant due to itsease of use.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
