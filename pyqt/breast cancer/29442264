Tumor[89Zr]trastuzumab uptake was assessed qualitatively and semiquantitatively asmaximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), and correlated with HER2 status.Additionally, intrapatient heterogeneity of [89Zr]trastuzumab uptake wasevaluated.RESULTS: On a per-patient basis, [89Zr]trastuzumab-PET/CT was positive in 30/34(88.2%) HER2-positive and negative in 15/16 (93.7%) HER2-negative patients.Considering all lesions, the SUVmax was not significantly different in patientswith HER2-positive versus HER2-negative disease (p = 0.06). The same was true of when only hepatic lesions were evaluated (p = 0.42). However, after excludinghepatic lesions, tumor SUVmax was significantly higher in HER2-positive compared to HER2-negative patients (p = 0.003). A cutoff SUVmax of 3.2, determined by ROC analysis, demonstrated positive-predictive value of 83.3% (95% CI 65.3%, 94.4%), sensitivity of 75.8% (57.7%, 88.9%), negative-predictive value of 50% (24.7%,75.3%), and specificity of 61.5% (95% 31.6%, 86.1%) for differentiatingHER2-positive from HER2-negative lesions. There was intrapatient heterogeneity of[89Zr]trastuzumab uptake in 20% of patients with multiple lesions.CONCLUSIONS: [89Zr]trastuzumab has the potential to characterize the HER2 status of the complete tumor burden in patients with breast cancer, thus obviatingrepeat or multiple tissue sampling to assess intrapatient heterogeneity of HER2status.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4696-z PMCID: PMC5955803 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29442264
