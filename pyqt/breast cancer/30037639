Electronic address: Rebecca.hartley@ucalgary.ca.Transgender men or Female-to-Male (FtM) patients' risk of breast cancer andscreening recommendations remain unclear. The objective of this study is toperform a systematic review of the literature and document all reported cases of FtM breast cancer as well as provide research recommendations. Following PRISMAguidelines, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PubMed, and Cochrane Database of SystematicReviews were searched from inception until September 15, 2016. Screening and dataextraction were performed in duplicate by two independent reviewers (RH and JS). Study quality was assessed using a component-based system. Study characteristics,patient demographics, breast cancer characteristics, presentation and management are reported. Eight articles met inclusion criteria representing 17 transgendermen with breast cancer. Median age at diagnosis was 44.5 years. Breast cancertypes included: 8 invasive ductal carcinomas, two tubular carcinomas and sevenunrecorded. Twelve of the 14 known hormone status tumours were estrogen receptor positive (85.7%), of which nine were also progesterone positive. The most common was breast lump (n = 6) and four patients had local regional or distant diseaseat presentation. Management was reported for ten patients: six patients underwentmastectomy (60.0%), three radiation (30.0%), and five chemotherapy (50.0%).Breast cancer is present in transgender men and the risk is dependent on topsurgery; those with top surgery appear to be lower risk than natal females. More longitudinal studies and better population data are required to contribute toevidence-based screening recommendations.Crown Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
