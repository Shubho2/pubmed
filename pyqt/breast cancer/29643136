A 66-year-old woman presented with a growing left orbital tumour.Orbital CT scan was consistent with lymphoma. However, ocular pathology revealed small neoplastic cells showing an 'indian file pattern' suggestive of metastatic carcinoma and immunohistochemistry was positive for CK7, CK CAM5.2 and oestrogen receptor. A systemic evaluation was then performed with mammogram, breastultrasound and MRI considered normal. An exhaustive systemic evaluation revealed multiple bone lesions, a right axillary lymph node lesion, which presented thesame pattern on pathology and immunohistochemistry, with no evidence of a primarytumour. A diagnosis of a metastatic lobular carcinoma of the breast (T0, N1, M1) was made and the patient was started on chemotherapy and adjuvant hormonaltherapy.© BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article)2018.
