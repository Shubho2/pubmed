[Epub ahead of print]A Comparison of Different Intensities of Patient Navigation After AbnormalMammography.Glassgow AE(1), Molina Y(1), Kim S(1), Campbell RT(1), Darnell J(2), CalhounEA(3).Author information: (1)1 University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.(2)2 Loyola University, Maywood, IL, USA.(3)3 University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.BACKGROUND: Patient navigation is a practice strategy to address barriers totimely diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The aim of this study was to examinethe effectiveness of varying intensities of patient navigation and timelydiagnostic resolution after abnormal mammography.METHOD: This is a secondary analysis of a subset of women with an abnormalscreening or diagnostic mammogram who participated in the "patient navigation in medically underserved areas" 5-year randomized trial. We compared timelydiagnostic resolution in women assigned to different intensities of patientnavigation including, full navigation intervention, no contact with navigators,or limited contact with navigators.RESULTS: The sample included 1,725 women with abnormal mammogram results. Womenwho interacted with patient navigators had significantly fewer days to diagnosticresolution after abnormal mammography compared with women who did not interactwith patient navigators.DISCUSSION: Results from our study suggest that even limited contact withnavigators encourages women to seek more timely diagnostic resolution after anabnormal mammogram, which may offer a low-cost practice strategy to improvetimely diagnosis for disadvantaged and underserved women.DOI: 10.1177/1524839918782168 PMID: 29907079
