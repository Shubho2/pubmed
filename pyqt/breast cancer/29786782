As a result oftoxicity, the clinical failures or the modest benefits associated withantiangiogenic TKI therapy may be related in some cases to suboptimal drug dosingand scheduling, thereby facilitating resistance. Most antiangiogenic TKIs,including pazopanib, are administered on a continuous daily basis. Here, instead,we evaluated the impact of increasing the dose and administering the drugintermittently. The rationale is that using such protocols, antitumor efficacycould be enhanced by direct tumor cell targeting effects in addition toinhibiting tumor angiogenesis. To test this, we employed two human tumorxenograft models, both of which manifest intrinsic resistance to pazopanib whenit is administered continuously: the VHL-wildtype SN12-PM6-1 renal cell carcinoma(RCC) and the metastatic MDA-MB-231/LM2-4 variant breast cancer cell line, whentreated as distant metastases. We evaluated four different doses and schedules ofpazopanib in the context of primary tumors and advanced metastatic disease, inboth models. The RCC model was not converted to drug sensitivity using theintermittent protocol. Using these protocols did not enhance the efficacy whentreating primary LM2-4 tumors. However, one of the high-dose intermittentpazopanib protocols increased median survival when treating advanced metastaticdisease. In conclusion, these results overall suggest that primary tumors showingsensitivity to continuous pazopanib treatment may predict response to this drugwhen given at high doses intermittently in the context of advanced metastaticdisease, that are otherwise resistant to the conventional protocol.DOI: 10.1007/s10456-018-9623-8 PMID: 29786782
