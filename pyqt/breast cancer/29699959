The incidencehas increased in recent years due to childbearing at advanced maternal ages dueto career choices and/or the development of reproductive technology.Approximately two thirds of cancer cases during pregnancy comprise invasivecervical cancers and breast cancer. Cancer during gestation is characterized by aneed for specialized treatment due to major changes in the hormonal profile(estrogen-progesterone), metabolism (enhancement of anabolism), hemodynamicchanges (hyperdynamic circulation), immunologic changes (cell-mediated andhumoral immunity), and increased angiogenesis (increased blood flow towards theuterus). Moreover, the management of such patients is based on the trimester ofpregnancy, type and stage of cancer, and informed consent of the mother based on her wishes. The optimal treatment of cancer during pregnancy remains elusivebecause there are limited data from retrospective studies with small samples. As a result, it is crucial that data regarding survival of the women and long-termfollow-up of the children from different cancer centers and registries areshared. This need is dictated by the fact that the incidence of cancer duringpregnancy will continue to rise as child-bearing age continues to increase.DOI: 10.4274/jtgga.2018.0044 PMCID: PMC5994818PMID: 29699959
