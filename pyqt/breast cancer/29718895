We report our experience performingSSM/NSM for breast cancer treatment compared to CM with a long follow-upperiod.All consecutive patients who underwent mastectomy for breast cancer atAsan Medical Center between January 1993 and December 2008 were identified byretrospective medical chart review. The patients who underwent NSM/SSM, followed by immediate breast reconstruction with a pedicled transverse rectus abdominismusculocutaneous flap (TRAM), were compared to the patients who underwent CM interms of breast-cancer specific survival (BCSS) rate, distant metastasis-freesurvival (DMFS) rate, and local recurrence (LR) rate.During the study period,6028 patients underwent mastectomy for breast cancer. Of these, 1032 and 4996underwent NSM/SSM with TRAM and CM, respectively. Their median follow-updurations were 94.4 (range, 8.1-220.2) and 110.8 (range, 6.1-262.0) months,respectively. Their 5 year BCSS rates were 95.4% and 88.1%, respectively(log-rank, P < .001). Their 5 year DMFS rates were 93.0% and 85.6%, respectively (log-rank, P < .001).Relative to CM, NSM/SSM, followed by immediate breastreconstruction, may be a viable and oncologically safe surgical treatment inselected patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010680 PMID: 29718895  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
