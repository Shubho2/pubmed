This study directly compared different estrogen doses,formulations, and route of delivery of estrogen alone among women with ahysterectomy in relation to invasive breast cancer incidence.METHODS: The Women's Health Initiative Observational Study is a large multicenterprospective cohort study conducted at 40 US sites. Analyses included 26,525postmenopausal women with a hysterectomy, aged 50 to 79 years, at study entry,recruited between September, 1993 and December, 1998, with annual follow-upthrough September 12, 2005.RESULTS: Average follow-up was 8.2 years. For conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)users, no difference was observed between low-dose CEE (<0.625 mg) compared with conventional-dose CEE (0.625 mg) for breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, 95%confidence interval [CI] 0.65, 1.48)]. Compared with conventional-dose CEE,transdermal estrogen was associated with a nonsignificant lower risk of invasive breast cancer (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47, 1.19). The low prevalence of transdermal uselikely limited power for this comparison, and for a comparison of oral estradiol to conventional-dose CEE (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.84, 1.39).CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that invasive breast cancer risk did not differ appreciably in women with a hysterectomy using estrogen-alone when directlycomparing different doses, formulations, and routes of delivery to theconventional oral CEE. These findings suggest that the lower breast cancer riskfound in the WHI estrogen-alone trial may extend to lower doses of CEE.Additional research is needed to confirm these hypotheses.DOI: 10.1097/GME.0000000000001115 PMID: 29738414
