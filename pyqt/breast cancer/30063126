[Epub ahead of print]Long non-coding RNA SNHG14 induces trastuzumab resistance of breast cancer viaregulating PABPC1 expression through H3K27 acetylation.Dong H(1), Wang W(1), Mo S(2), Liu Q(3), Chen X(4), Chen R(1), Zhang Y(1), ZouK(1), Ye M(1), He X(1), Zhang F(1), Han J(1), Hu J(5).Author information: (1)Department of General Surgery, Hainan General Hospital, Jinan University,Haikou, China.(2)Department of Science and Education, Hainan Maternal and Child HealthHospital, Haikou, China.(3)Department of Pharmacy, Hainan Medical University, Haikou, China.(4)Department of General Surgery, The Frist Affiliated Hospital, ChongqingMedical University, Chongqing, China.(5)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Second Affiliated Hospital,Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.Currently, resistance to trastuzumab, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitor, has become one major obstacle for improving the clinicaloutcome of patients with advanced HER2+ breast cancer. While cell behaviour canbe modulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the contributions of lncRNAs inprogression and trastuzumab resistance of breast cancer are largely unknown. Tothis end, the involvement and regulatory functions of lncRNA SNHG14 in humanbreast cancer were investigated. RT-qPCR assay showed that SNHG14 wasup-regulated in breast cancer tissues and associated with trastuzumab response.Gain- and loss-of-function experiments revealed that overexpression of SNHG14promotes cell proliferation, invasion and trastuzumab resistance, whereasknockdown of SNHG14 showed an opposite effect. PABPC1 gene was identified as adownstream target of SNHG14, and PABPC1 mediates the SNHG14-induced oncogeniceffects. More importantly, ChIP assays demonstrated that lncRNA SNHG14 may inducePABPC1 expression through modulating H3K27 acetylation in the promoter of PABPC1 gene, thus resulting in the activation of Nrf2 signalling pathway. These datasuggest that lncRNA SNHG14 promotes breast cancer tumorigenesis and trastuzumabresistance through regulating PABPC1 expression through H3K27 acetylation.Therefore, SNHG14 may serve as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target forbreast cancer patients.Â© 2018 The Authors.
