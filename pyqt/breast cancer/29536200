VG patients attended a VERT-basededucation session detailing RT immobilisation, planning and treatment. Allpatients completed questionnaires at four time points throughout their treatment,with survey sub-sections on RT knowledge, experience and anxiety.RESULTS: For both groups, anxiety levels were highest at time point 1(T1 afterinitial radiation oncologist consultation) (CG, 41.2; VG, 43.1), with a gradualdecrease observed thereafter at time points before simulation, at the beginningof treatment and at the end of treatment (p > 0.05). The VG's RT knowledge scoreswere statistically significantly higher than those of the CG scores at all timepoints following VERT education (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: This study reports the high value of VERT breast cancer-targetededucation programs in improving RT knowledge and perhaps decreasing patientanxiety. Continued efforts are required to improve patients' accessibility toVERT in Australia, and to better understand the effect of VERT's uniqueeducational features on patients' emotional and physical needs throughout theirRT.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4114-4 PMID: 29536200
