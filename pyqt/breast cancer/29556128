It could be shown that sugars can improve the absorption across cell membranesand can help to bypass some pharmacokinetic problems. Carbohydrates as mostcommon organic molecules are an important issue of plant and animal metabolisms. They are non toxic and have important duties in the body like participating inDNA and RNA synthesis and being responsible for energy production. In addition,they have many hydroxyl, aldehyde and ketone groups that attract attention forsynthesis as a potential drug derivative. 1,2,3,-Triazole compounds have alsoimportant role in heterocyclic chemistry because of their pharmaceuticalproperties and their high reactivity, which could be used as a building block forcomplex chemical compounds. In this study, following the "Click Reaction" of 5-FUand tetra-O-acetylglycose the 5-fluorouracil derivative1-[{1'-(2″,3″,4″,6″-tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-glycopyronosyl)-1'H-1',2',3'-triazole-4'-yl} methyl]5-fluorouracil was synthesized. Following, a micellar formulation of5-Fluorouracil derivative was prepared and characterized in terms of particlesize, polydispersity index, zeta potential, refractive index and pH. Furthermore,the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of the 5-fluorouracil derivative wasinvestigated using an in vitro cell culture model and the AMES test. According tothe results of this study, the novel 5-fluorouracil derivative could be a drugcandidate for the therapy of cancer and needs further in vivo investigations.DOI: 10.1016/j.jsps.2018.01.004 PMCID: PMC5856941PMID: 29556128
