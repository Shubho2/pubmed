Invasion andintravasation, two critical steps in the metastatic process, are influenced bythese interactions. Macrophages are of particular interest when it comes tostudying tumor cell invasiveness. Previous studies have shown that there isparacrine loop signaling between breast cancer cells and macrophages involvingcolony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) produced by tumor cells and epidermal growth factor (EGF) production by macrophages. In this paper, we identify a novelparacrine loop between tumor cells and macrophages involving neuregulin (NRG1)and notch signaling.METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine the role of NRG1, a ligand of theErbB3 receptor, in macrophage stimulation of tumor cell transendothelialmigration and intravasation. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)and western blot to determine ErbB3 and NRG1 expression, respectively. An invitro transendothelial migration (iTEM) assay was used to examine the effects of short hairpin (sh)RNA targeting NRG1 in tumor cells and clustered regularlyinterspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) knockout of jagged 1 (JAG1) inmacrophages. Orthotopic xenograft injections in mice were used to confirm resultsin vivo.RESULTS: In our system, macrophages were the primary cells showing expression of ErbB3, and a blocking antibody against ErbB3 resulted in a significant decreasein macrophage-induced transendothelial migration of breast cancer cells.Stimulation of macrophages with NRG1 upregulated mRNA and protein expression ofJAG1, a ligand of the Notch receptor, and JAG1 production by macrophages wasimportant for transendothelial migration of tumor cells.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that stimulation of macrophages by tumorcell NRG1 can enhance transendothelial migration and intravasation. We alsodemonstrate that this effect is due to induction of macrophage JAG1, an importantligand of the Notch signaling pathway.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0960-8 PMCID: PMC5894135PMID: 29636067
