Electronic address:Spirinalv@oncology.tomsk.ru.Metabolic syndrome (MS) is one of the leading risk factors for the development ofsome common cancers (endometrial cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer, colorectalcancer). Currently, a drug-induced metabolic syndrome related with androgendeprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer represents a serious medicalproblem. Not only MS, or its individual components, but MS variants withdifferent levels of leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, resistin are associated withtumor invasion, metastasis and survival rates in patients with MS-associatedmalignancies.Copyright © 2018 Diabetes India.
