This paper describes Mexicanimmigrant farmworkers' knowledge of colorectal, breast, and testicular cancer,and compares farmworkers' cancer knowledge to that of other Mexican immigrants.Survey interviews for this study were conducted with 100 farmworkers and 100non-farmworkers in 2015 in North Carolina as part of an ongoing community-basedparticipatory research project. We found low to moderate levels of knowledgeabout colorectal, breast, and testicular cancer among farmworkers. Compared tonon-farmworkers, farmworkers had similar levels of knowledge about breast andtesticular cancer, but slightly lower knowledge about colorectal cancer(p = 0.0087). Few studies have used quantitative methods to assess farmworkers'knowledge of specific types of cancer. Our results demonstrate a need forincreased dissemination of existing cancer education programs and furtherresearch to develop additional educational tools.DOI: 10.1007/s10903-018-0771-0 PMID: 29948650
