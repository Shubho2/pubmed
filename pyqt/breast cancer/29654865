Electronic address: sandrine.poirot@inserm.fr.Oxygenation products of cholesterol, named oxysterols, were suspected since the20th century to be involved in carcinogenesis. Among the family of oxysterolmolecules, cholesterol-5,6-epoxides (5,6-EC) retained the attention of scientistsbecause they contain a putative alkylating epoxide group. However, studies failedinto demonstrating that 5,6-EC were direct carcinogens and revealed a surprising chemical stability and unreactivity towards nucleophiles in standard conditions. Analyses of 5,6-EC metabolism in normal cells showed that they were extensivelytransformed into cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (CT) by the cholesterol-5,6-epoxidehydrolase (ChEH). Studies performed in cancer cells showed that CT wasadditionally metabolized into an oxysterol identified as the6-oxo-cholestan-3β,5α-diol (OCDO), by the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase oftype 2 (HSD2), the enzyme which inactivates cortisol into cortisone. Importantly,OCDO was shown to display tumor promoter properties in breast cancers, by bindingto the glucocorticoid receptor, and independently of their estrogen receptorstatus, revealing the existence of a new tumorigenic pathway centered on 5,6-EC. In breast tumors from patients, OCDO production as well as the expression of the enzymes involved in the pathway producing OCDO, namely ChEH subunits and HSD2,were higher compared to normal tissues, and overexpression of these enzymescorrelate with a higher risk of patient death, indicating that thisonco-metabolism is of major importance to breast cancer pathology. Herein, wewill review the actual knowledge and the future trends in OCDO chemistry,biochemistry, metabolism and mechanism of action and will discuss the impact ofOCDO discovery on new anticancer therapeutic strategies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et BiologieMoléculaire (SFBBM).
