Although it has been shown that knockdown of GGCT induces cellular senescence andnon-apoptotic cell death, associated with upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinaseinhibitors (CDKIs) including p21WAF1/CIP1, the cellular events that follow GGCTdepletion are not fully understood. Here, we show that GGCT depletion inducedautophagy in MCF7 breast and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Conversely,overexpression of GGCT in NIH3T3 fibroblast under conditions of serum deprivationinhibited autophagy and increased proliferation. Simultaneous knockdown ofautophagy related-protein 5, a critical effector of autophagy, along with GGCT inMCF7 and PC3 cells led to significant attenuation of the multiple cellularresponses, including upregulation of CDKIs, increased numbers ofsenescence-associated Î²-galactosidase positive senescent cells, and growthinhibition. Furthermore, we show that autophagy-promoting signaling cascadesincluding activation of the AMPK-ULK1 pathway and/or inactivation of themTORC2-Akt pathway were triggered in GGCT-depleted cells. These results indicate that autophagy plays an important role in the growth inhibition of cancer cellscaused by GGCT depletion.PMCID: PMC5934555PMID: 29736310
