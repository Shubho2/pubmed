Email: mzibri@yahoo.comWorldwide, breast cancer is the most frequent neoplasm and the second leadingcause of cancer death among females. It dominates in both developed anddeveloping countries and represents a major public health problem. The etiologyis multifactorial and involves exogenous agents as well as endogenous factors.Although they account for only a small fraction of the breast cancer burden,mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are known to confer a high riskpredisposition. Mutations in moderate/low-penetrance genes may also contribute tobreast cancer risk. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the CHEK2 gene are involved in breast cancer susceptibility due to its impact on DNA repairprocesses and replication checkpoints. This study was conducted to evaluate thefrequencies of three germline mutations in CHEK2 gene (c.1100delC, R145W andI157T) in breast cancers in Rwanda. Using direct DNA sequencing, we analyzed 41breast cancer patients and 42 normal breast controls but could not detect anypositives. CHEK2 mutations may be a rare event in Rwandan population and may onlyplay a minor if an role in breast cancer predisposition among familial andsporadic cases.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.2.375 PMCID: PMC5980922PMID: 29479983
