Growingevidence indicates that patients with ERα-positive breast cancer show poorresponse to chemotherapeutics. However, ERα-mediated drug-resistant mechanismsremain unclear.METHODS: Levels of WW domain-binding protein 2 (WBP2) and drug-resistant genewere determined by western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. Cell viability was measured by preforming MTT assay. CD243 expression and apoptosis rate wereevaluated by flow cytometry. Interactions of WBP2/ERα and ERα/MDR1 were detected by co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay,respectively.RESULTS: There was an intrinsic link between WBP2 and ERα in drug-resistantcancer cells. Upregulation of WBP2 in MCF7 cells increased the chemoresistance todoxorubicin, while RNAi-mediated knockdown of WBP2 in MCF7/ADR cells sensitisedthe cancer cells to doxorubicin. Further investigation in in vitro and in vivomodels demonstrated that WBP2 expression was directly correlated with MDR1, andWBP2 could directly modulate MDR1 transcription through binding to ERα, resultingin increased chemotherapy drug resistance.CONCLUSIONS: Our finding provides a new mechanism for the chemotherapy responseof ERα-positive breast tumours, and WBP2 might be a key molecule for developingnew therapeutic strategies to treat chemoresistance in breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0119-5 PMID: 29937544
