Electronic address: donald.mcdonnell@duke.edu.(2)Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University School ofMedicine, Durham, NC 27710, USA.In this issue of Cancer Cell, Jeselsohn et al. dissect the function of several ofthe most clinically important estrogen receptor alpha mutants associated withendocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer and demonstrate that they manifest disease-relevant neomorphic activities that likely contribute to tumorpathogenesis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
