Electronic address: Rainer.Schobert@uni-bayreuth.de.A series of four 2‑amino‑3‑cyano‑4‑(3/4‑pyridyl)‑4H‑benzo[h]chromenes 2a-d andtheir dichlorido(p‑cymene)ruthenium(II) complexes 3a-d were tested forantiproliferative, vascular-disruptive, anti-angiogenic and DNA-binding activity.The coordination of the 4‑pyridyl‑4H‑naphthopyrans 2 to ruthenium led tocomplexes with pleiotropic effects. Unlike the free ligands 2a-d, their rutheniumcomplexes 3a-d showed a significant affinity for DNA as demonstrated byelectrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and ethidium bromide assays. Bindingof 3a-d to calf thymus DNA proceeded about 10-times faster compared withcisplatin. Treatment of HT-29 colon carcinoma, 518A2 melanoma and MCF-7Topobreast cancer cells with 3a and 3b caused an accumulation of cells in the G2/Mphase and an increase of the fraction of mitotic cells in the case of HT-29, due to alterations of the microtubule cytoskeleton as shown by immunofluorescencestaining. Complexes 3b-c showed a dual effect on the vascular system. Theysuppressed angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos and they destroyed the vasculatureof the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in fertilized chicken eggs. They alsoinhibited the vasculogenic mimicry, typical of U-87 glioblastoma cells in tubeformation assays.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
