Electronic address: 1363515859@qq.com.Despite significant progress in the treatment of breast cancer due to advances insurgery, cytotoxic agents, and endocrine therapy, the prognosis for patients has not improved much. Accumulated evidence indicates that heterogeneous nuclearribonucleoprotein M (hnRNPM) and Wnt/β-catenin function as tumor oncogenes in theprogression of many cancers. The present study aimed to explore whetherHnRNPM/β-catenin signaling molecules might serve as a genetic target for breastcancer treatment. To shed light on this issue, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) detection, Western blotting, and immunohistochemicalstaining were performed. The hnRNPM is expressed at a much higher level in breastcancer tissues and cell lines than in noncancerous tissues and cell lines. Invitro studies revealed that overexpressed hnRNPM promoted cell proliferation and colony formation but inhibited cell apoptosis. In vivo results demonstrated that upregulation of hnRNPM dramatically increased breast cancer xenograft tumorgrowth. Western blotting and immunofluorescence studies revealed that hnRNPMmarkedly activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and catalyzed its translocation fromthe cytoplasm to the nucleus by targeting axin, a negative regulator ofWnt/β-catenin signaling in MCF-7 and KPL-4 cells. Elevated levels of c-Myc andcyclin D1 were observed when MCF-7 and KPL-4 cells were transfected with a hnRNPMvector. These findings indicate that the hnRNPM/axin/β-catenin signaling pathway acts as an oncogenic promoter in the progression of breast cancer, suggestingthat hnRNPM may be a potential target for the treatment of this disease.Copyright © 2018.
