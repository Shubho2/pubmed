Within a cellularmicroenvironment, protein-protein interactions generate new functions that can bedefined by single or multiple modes of protein interactions. We outline here the clinical importance of targeting of the Nme-1 (NDPK-A)-Prune-1 protein complex incancer, where an imbalance in the formation of this protein-protein complex canresult in inhibition of tumor progression. We discuss here recent functional datausing a small synthetic competitive cell-permeable peptide (CPP) that has showntherapeutic efficacy for impairing formation of the Nme-1-Prune-1 protein complexin mouse preclinical xenograft tumor models (e.g., breast, prostate, colon, andneuroblastoma). We thus believe that further discoveries in the near futurerelated to the identification of new protein-protein interactions will have greatimpact on the development of new therapeutic strategies against various cancers.DOI: 10.1038/s41374-017-0011-6 PMID: 29449633
