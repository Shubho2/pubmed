Theprimary prognosis endpoint was event-free survival (EFS), and the secondaryendpoint was overall survival (OS). The pooled hazard ratio (HR) was estimated byusing random-effects model according to the results of heterogeneity.RESULTS: Fifteen eligible studies with 3574 breast cancer patients were included.For EFS, patients with higher primary SUVmax showed a poorer survival prognosiswith pooled HR of 1.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40-2.73). The combined HR of high SUVmax in ALN and ALN-to-primary SUVmax ratio (N/T ratio) were 1.89 (95% CI 0.70-5.07) and 2.06 (95% CI 0.59-7.21), respectively. In analyzing invasiveductal carcinoma (IDC) patients, the pooled HR was 1.91 (95% CI 1.40-2.64). ForOS, the pooled HR of SUVmax in primary lesion and ALN were 0.64 (95% CI0.23-1.84) and 1.09 (95% CI 0.07-16.53), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggested that patients with high primary SUVmaxmay experience a higher risk for recurrence or a poor progression. Moreover, the SUVmax of 18F-FDG showed a significant prognostic value in IDC patients.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejrad.2018.05.014 PMID: 30017264
