However, current methods for detecting miRNA expression havemajor disadvantages, such as being invasive and non-reproducible. Theepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated as a pivotal event inthe metastasis, stemness, and chemoresistance of malignant tumors.PROCEDURES: In our study, we constructed a new reporter gene,Luc2/tdT_miR200c_3TS, to examine the in vitro and in vivo expression of miR-200c,an EMT-associated miRNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure theexpression levels of miR-200c and EMT-related mRNA, and luciferase assay andbioluminescence imaging were used to measure the luciferase activities in vitroand in vivo, respectively.RESULTS: We found that the expression level of miR-200c was negatively associatedwith cell migration and invasion. Luciferase activities were regulated by thedifferential expression levels of miR-200c and EMT process.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Luc2/tdT_miR200c_3TS may be a usefultool for monitoring the expression level of miR-200c at both the cellular leveland in living animals, thereby providing a potential high-throughput approach foranticancer drug screening.DOI: 10.1007/s11307-018-1180-4 PMID: 29532351
