Electronic address: xguan@nju.edu.cn.Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key developmental program in whichepithelial cells lose polarity and become mesenchymal cells, and that is oftenactivated during cancer invasion and metastasis. Triple negative breast cancer(TNBC) patients have a relatively aggressive biological behavior with a high riskof distant recurrence and metastasis. Here, we stimulated TNBC cells to undergoEMT, and detected the protein expression profiles of the protein secretion.High-throughput data showed that EMT could promote TNBC cells to secret PAI-1. Wefound that TNBC-secreted PAI-1 could increase cell growth, migration andinvasion, and the expression of EMT markers in the TNBC cell lines and xenograft PAI-1-/- mice model. Using a tissues microarray of 165 TNBC patients andpublished breast cancer database, we found PAI-1 expression was significantlyelevated in the breast cancer tissues, comparing with the normal adjacent tissuesand was associated with prognosis of patients with TNBC. Taken together, ourresults suggests an important role of PAI-1 in the EMT process of TNBC cells and illustrates the great potential of developing PAI-1-targeting therapy forclinical TNBC patients.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
