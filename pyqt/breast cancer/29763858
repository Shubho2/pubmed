Due to the higher incidence of estrogen receptor negative tumours in women <50,the potential for HRT to promote breast cancer recurrence may differ from olderage groups.METHODS: We performed a search of Medline, EMBASE and CINAHL through June 2016.For the observational studies relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)were calculated for the recurrence rate among HRT users and nonusers. A randomeffects model was used to estimate the combined RR using the Mantel-Haenszelmethod.RESULTS: Four papers satisfied our inclusion criteria. 3477 subjects wereanalyzed. On pooled meta-analysis of breast cancer recurrence in theobservational studies, no significant association was found between HRT and risk of recurrence (RR 1.04 [95% CI 0.45, 2.41]). The randomized controlled trial(RCT) included found an increased risk of recurrence with HRT among women <50 (HR1.56 [95% CI 1.1-2.2]). However, among women of all ages with an estrogenreceptor negative tumour there was no significant difference in recurrence whencompared to hormone receptor positive tumours (HR 1.15 [95% CI 0.7-1.8,p = 0.55]).DISCUSSION: This review on HRT in breast cancer survivors <50 revealedconflicting results between randomized and observational study data. Furtherstudies are warranted to investigate the association between HRT and recurrencerates in younger breast cancer survivors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
