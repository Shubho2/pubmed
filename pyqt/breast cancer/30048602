[Epub ahead of print]Evaluating the Completeness of ClinicalTrials.gov.Stergiopoulos S(1), Getz KA(1), Blazynski C(2).Author information: (1)1 Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, Tufts University School ofMedicine, Boston, MA, USA.(2)2 Informa Business Intelligence, Inc, New York, NY, USA.BACKGROUND: To date, although studies have been conducted to assess compliancewith listing clinical trial information, to our knowledge there is nothing in theliterature examining the completion and accuracy of clinical trial siteinformation on ClinicalTrials.gov .METHODS: We compared clinical trial information originating fromClinicalTrials.gov to a widely subscribed and well-established commercialclinical trial database, Informa Pharma Intelligence's Trialtrove, as Trialtrove includes information from ClinicalTrials.gov among its more than 30,000 sources. We assessed breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and pain clinical trials submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov . We compared the numberof trials associated with each disease indication for each database, and weconducted a head-to-head comparison of certain data fields of clinical trialinformation found in both databases for clinical trials with identical NationalClinical Trial (NCT) numbers.RESULTS: As of January 17, 2017, Trialtrove captured 31% more clinical trials(10,786 trials) in the selected disease indications than did ClinicalTrials.gov(7,419 trials) using identical Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms for breastcancer, non-small cell lung cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and pain. Clinical trial site information was identical in 48% of clinical trials, while countryinformation was identical in 82% of clinical trials, and patient enrollmentfigures identical for 86% of clinical trials. Clinical trial status, Phase, andstart year differed across the 2 datasets.CONCLUSION: This study provides a baseline to compare the completeness of trialinformation required by the NIH and HHS with respect to reporting practices onClinicalTrials.gov . While one cannot determine which database is more accurate: ClinicalTrials.gov or Trialtrove, wide variation exists in clinical trial siteand country information for trials with identical NCT numbers suggesting thatcaution should be used when relying solely on ClinicalTrials.gov to assess theclinical trial landscape.DOI: 10.1177/2168479018782885 PMID: 30048602
