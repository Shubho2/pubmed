The purpose of this study is to report our experience using tomosynthesis-guided vacuum-assisted biopsies (VABs) for ADs that were occult at 2D mammography and ultrasound and to analyze thepositive predictive value for malignancy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 34 DBT-detected ADsthat were occult at mammography and ultrasound.RESULTS: We found a positive predictive value of 26% (nine malignancies in 34lesions). Eight of the malignancies were invasive and one was ductal carcinoma insitu. The invasive cancers were grade 1 (4/8; 50%), grade 2 (2/8; 25%), or grade 3 (1/8; 13%); information about one invasive cancer was not available. The meansize of the invasive cancers at pathologic examination was 7.5 mm (range, 6-30mm).CONCLUSION: Tomosynthesis-guided VAB is a feasible method to sample ADs that are occult at 2D mammography and ultrasound. Tomosynthesis-guided VAB is a minimally invasive method that detected a significant number of carcinomas, most of whichwere grade 1 cancers. Further studies are needed.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.18802 PMID: 29570367
