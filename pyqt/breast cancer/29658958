Epub 2018 Jan30.Treatment with Src inhibitor Dasatinib results in elevated metastatic potentialin the 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma model.Hughes VS(1), Siemann DW(1).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.Introduction: The src inhibitor Dasatinib has been widely studied as ananti-metastatic agent. The aims of this study were to examine the effect of Srcinhibition on the metastatic potential of the 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma.Context: Src is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase well-known to contribute to themetastatic potential of tumour cells. It does so through alteration of signallingpathways important to metastasis. Elevated levels of Src are common in manycancer types, and have been correlated with tumour progression and poor patientprognosis.Aims: This study examined whether disruption of the Src signalling pathway could inhibit metastases formation.Settings and Design: The Src inhibitor Dasatinib was evaluated in vitro and invivo using the highly metastatic 4T1 murine mammary adenocarcinoma cell line.Methods and Material: In vitro assays included growth curve, western blot,migration, and invasion assays. In vivo assays included intradermal and tail veininjection models.Statistical analysis used: In vitro data were analysed using one-way ANOVA withDunnett's multiple comparisons in GraphPad Prism 6.0. In vivo data were analysed using GraphPad Prism 6.0, using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test.Results: Dasatinib is effective at inhibiting in vitro phosphorylation of Src,migration and invasion in the 4T1 cell line, as well as angiogenesis in vivo. In vitro treatment with Dasatinib impaired the metastatic ability of tumour cells asassessed by a tail vein injection model. However, both the syngeneic BALB/c andthe athymic nu/nu mice receiving oral doses of the drug developed significantlyhigher numbers of 4T1 lung metastases. This effect was not seen in a differentbreast carcinoma cell line, the MDA-MB-231-4175-LM2, nor was this effect seen in the murine fibrosarcoma KHT cell line.Conclusions: The 4T1 cell line is not an appropriate model to study Srcinhibition.DOI: 10.4103/tme.tme_19_17 PMCID: PMC5894523PMID: 29658958
