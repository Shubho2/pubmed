Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations betweenproduct use and breast cancer incidence.RESULTS: A total of 2,326 women developed breast cancer during follow-up(averageâ€‰follow-up=5.4y). Among black women, none of the latent class hazardratios was elevated, but there were <100 cases in any category, limiting power.Among white women, those classified as "moderate" and "frequent" users of beauty products had increased risk of breast cancer relative to "infrequent" users[HR=1.13 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.27) and HR=1.15 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.30), respectively].Frequent users of skincare products also had increased risk of breast cancerrelative to infrequent users [HR=1.13 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.29)]. None of the hairproduct classes was associated with increased breast cancer risk. Theassociations with beauty and skin products were stronger in postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women, but not significantly so.CONCLUSIONS: This work generates novel hypotheses about personal care product useand breast cancer risk. Whether these results are due to specific chemicals or toother correlated behaviors needs to be evaluated.https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1480.DOI: 10.1289/EHP1480 PMCID: PMC6066348PMID: 29467107
