However, its delivery to the cancer cells is thebottleneck in its clinical translation. Herein we report cationic amphiphiliccopolymers grafted with cholesterol (chol), N, N-dimethyldipropylenetriamine(cation chain) and 4-(2-aminoethyl)morpholine (morph) for miR-34a delivery. Thecopolymer interacts with miR-34a at low N/P ratios (∼2/1) to form nanoplexes ofsize ∼108 nm and a zeta potential ∼ +39 mV. In vitro studies in 4T1 and MCF-7cells indicated efficient transfection efficiency. The intracellularcolocalization suggested that the copolymer effectively transported the FAMlabeled siRNA into the cytoplasm within 2 h and escaped from the endo-/lysosomal environment. The developed miR-34a nanoplexes inhibited the breast cancer cellgrowth as confirmed by MTT assay wherein 28% and 34% cancer cell viability wasobserved in 4T1 and MCF-7 cells, respectively. Further, miR-34a nanoplexespossess immense potential to induce apoptosis in both cell lines.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00228 PMID: 29747513
