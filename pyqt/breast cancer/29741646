The study aims to evaluate breast cancer screening behaviors and toidentify the predictors of insufficient knowledge and attitudes towards breastcancer and its screening among female residents.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted from April to June 2016 inMacao. Quota sampling of women completed the modified Chinese Breast CancerScreening Beliefs questionnaire (CBCSB) to assess their breast cancer-relatedperceptions, screening attitudes and behaviors. Univariate and multivariatelogistic regressions were performed to identify the predictors of poor-screening practices, attitudes, knowledge and perceived barriers to mammography.Result: A total of 417 women (mean age±SD: 50.5±5.7) completed surveys, with 160 (38.4%), 196 (47.0%) and 103 (24.7%) women received breast self-examination,clinical breast examination and mammography as recommended, respectively.Nulliparity (OR=2.56, 95% CI = 1.14-5.73) and low education (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.04-2.84) were significantly associated with negative attitude towards healthcheck-ups. Women did not know anyone with breast cancer (OR = 2.30, 95% CI =1.50-3.55) were more likely to have insufficient knowledge about breast cancer.Low education (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.25-3.04) and not knowing anyone with breast cancer (OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.31-3.13) were identified as predictors forperceived barriers to mammography.Conclusion: Recommendations for breast cancer screening are poorly followed bythe residents in Macao, and a culturally tailored educational program is urgentlyneeded to raise the public's awareness of the disease and the screeningpractices.DOI: 10.1093/pubmed/fdy077 PMID: 29741646
