Primary endpoint was percentage of patients with trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) >20 μg/ml at Cycle 5 (Cycle 6 predose).Efficacy endpoints included pathological complete response and objective responserate. Non-inferiority of PF-05280014 to trastuzumab-EU was declared if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the stratified difference between groupsin the percentage of patients with Cycle 5 Ctrough >20 μg/ml was above theprespecified non-inferiority margin of - 12.5%.RESULTS: For PF-05280014 vs trastuzumab-EU patients, respectively, 92.1% vs 93.3%had Cycle 5 Ctrough >20 μg/ml; the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval(- 8.02%, 6.49%) for the stratified difference between groups was above thenon-inferiority margin (- 12.5%). Pathological complete response (47.0% vs 50.0%)and central radiology review-assessed objective response (88.1% vs 82.0%) rateswere comparable. Incidence of all-causality, grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverseevents was 38.1% vs 45.5%; antidrug antibody rates were 0% vs 0.89%.CONCLUSIONS: PF-05280014 demonstrated non-inferior pharmacokinetics andcomparable efficacy, safety and immunogenicity to trastuzumab-EU in patients withoperable HER2-positive breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0147-1 PMID: 30002437
