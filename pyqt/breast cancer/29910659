However, thosetreatments can come at a cost for the patient (short- and long-term toxicitiesfrom treatment) and at a financial cost for the health care system. Given theincrease in the number of costly anticancer agents being introduced into theclinical setting, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (asco) and theEuropean Society for Medical Oncology (esmo) have developed a system to quantify the value of new cancer treatments in terms of benefit, toxicities, and costs.Methods: In our value-assessment analysis, we included drugs that were funded in Canada between 2012 and 2017 for metastatic breast cancer. We reviewed theclinical benefit of those agents (survival, progression, quality of life), their costs, their value according to the asco and esmo value frameworks, and theirassessments from the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review [pcodr (in Canada, except Quebec)] and the Institut national d'excellence en santé et en services sociaux[iness (in Quebec)].Results: Drugs funded in Canada showed variation in their asco net health benefitscores and esmo magnitude of clinical benefit scores, but all had acost-effectiveness ratio greater than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.The strength and magnitude of the clinical benefit (for example, overall survivalbenefit vs. progression-free survival benefit) was not necessarily associatedwith a higher value score.Conclusions: Although great progress has been made in developing valueframeworks, use of those frameworks has to be refined to help patients and healthcare providers make informed decisions about the benefit of novel cancertherapies and to help policymakers make decisions about the societal benefit offunding those therapies.DOI: 10.3747/co.25.3846 PMCID: PMC6001763PMID: 29910659
