[Epubahead of print]Donkey milk kefir induces apoptosis and suppresses proliferation of Ehrlichascites carcinoma by decreasing iNOS in mice.Esener O(1), Balkan BM(2), Armutak EI(1), Uvez A(1), Yildiz G(3), Hafizoglu M(3),Yilmazer N(4), Gurel-Gurevin E(5).Author information: (1)a Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine ,Istanbul University , Istanbul.(2)b Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine , Mehmet AkifErsoy University , Burdur.(3)c Faculty of Veterinary Medicine , Mehmet Akif Ersoy University , Burdur.(4)d Department of Biology, Faculty of Arts and Sciences , Namık Kemal University, Tekirdag.(5)e Department of Biology, Faculty of Science , Istanbul University , Istanbul ,Turkey.Donkey milk and donkey milk kefir exhibit antiproliferative, antimutagenic andantibacterial effects. We investigated the effects of donkey milk and donkey milkkefir on oxidative stress, apoptosis and proliferation in Ehrlich ascitescarcinoma (EAC) in mice. Thirty-four adult male Swiss albino mice were dividedinto four groups as follows: group 1, administered 0.5 ml water; group 2,administered 0.5 ml water + EAC cells; group 3, administered 0.5 ml donkey milk +EAC cells; group 4, administered 0.5 ml donkey milk kefir + EAC cells. Weintroduced 2.5 x 106 EAC cells into each animal by subcutaneous injection. Tapwater, donkey milk and donkey milk kefir were administered by gavage for 10 days.Animals were sacrificed on day 11. After measuring the short and long diametersof the tumors, tissues were processed for histology. To determine oxidativestress, cell death and proliferation iNOS and eNOS, active caspase-3 andproliferating cell nuclear antigen were assessed using immunohistochemistry. ATUNEL assay also was used to detect apoptosis. Tumor volume decreased in thedonkey milk kefir group compared to the control and donkey milk groups. Tumorvolume increased in the donkey milk group compared to the control group.Proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels were higher in the donkey milk kefirgroup compared to the control and donkey milk groups. The number of apoptoticcells was less in the donkey milk group, compared to the control, whereas it was highest in the donkey milk kefir group. Donkey milk administration increased eNOSlevels and decreased iNOS levels, compared to the control group. In the donkeymilk kefir group, iNOS levels were significantly lower than those of the control and donkey milk groups, while eNOS levels were similar to the control group.Donkey milk kefir induced apoptosis, suppressed proliferation and decreasedco-expression of iNOS and eNOS. Donkey milk promoted development of the tumors.Therefore, donkey milk kefir appears to be more beneficial for treating breastcancer than donkey milk.DOI: 10.1080/10520295.2018.1448112 PMID: 29642726
