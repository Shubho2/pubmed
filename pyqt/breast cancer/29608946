Somephytoestrogens and mycoestrogens have been epidemiologically linked as riskfactors or protectors, however their mechanisms of action are complex and notfully understood. The aim of this study was to predict the potential of 36natural xenoestrogens to interact with 189 breast cancer proteins using AutoDock Vina. In order to validate our protocol, an in silico docking pose and bindingsite determination was compared with the crystallographic structure and the powerof prediction to distinguish between ligand and decoys was evaluated through areceiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the resultant docking affinitiesand in vitro data. The best affinity score was obtained for glyceollin IIIinteracting with the sex hormone binding globulin (-11.9 Kcal/mol), a plasmasteroid transport protein that regulates sex steroids bioavailability. Othernatural xenoestrogens such as beta-carotene, chrysophanol8-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside and glyceollin I, also presented good affinity forproteins related to this disease and the validation was successful. This studymay help to prioritize compounds for toxicity tests or drug development fromnatural scaffolds, and to elucidate their mechanisms of action.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
