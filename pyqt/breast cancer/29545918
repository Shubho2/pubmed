Weaim to find recurrent somatic copy number alteration (CNA) regions identifiedfrom breast cancer microarray data and associate the CNA status of the genesharbored in the regions to the survival of young women with breast cancer. Byusing the interval graph-based algorithm we developed, and the CNA dataconsisting of a Discovery set with 130 young women and a Validation set with 125 young women, we identified 38 validated recurrent CNAs containing 39 proteinencoding genes. CNA gain regions encompassing genes CAPN2, CDC73 and ASB13 arethe top 3 with the highest occurring frequencies in both the Discovery andValidation dataset, while gene SGCZ ranked top for the recurrent CNA lossregions. The mutation status of 9 of the 39 genes shows significant associations with breast cancer specific survival. Interestingly, the expression level of 2 ofthe 9 genes, ASB13 and SGCZ, shows significant association with survival outcome.Patients with CNA mutations in both of these genes had a worse survival outcomewhen compared to patients without the gene mutations. The mutated CNA status ingene ASB13 was associated with a higher gene expression, which predicted patient survival outcome. Together, identification of the CNA events with prognosticsignificance in young women with breast cancer may be used in genomic-guidedtreatment.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24336 PMCID: PMC5837756PMID: 29545918
