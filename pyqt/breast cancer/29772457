S Food and Drug Administration(FDA) granted regular approval for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)positive, metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor in postmenopausal women. Metabolite identification is a crucial aspect during drugdiscovery and development as the drug metabolites may be pharmacologically activeor possess toxicological activity. As there are no reports on the metabolismstudies of the PAB, the present study focused on investigation of the in vitroand in vivo metabolic fate of the drug. The in vitro metabolism studies werecarried out by using microsomes (HLM and RLM) and S9 fractions (Human and rat).The in vivo metabolism of the drug was studied by administration of the PABorally to the Sprague-Dawley rats followed by analysis of urine, faeces andplasma samples. The sample preparation includes simple protein precipitation (PP)followed by solid phase extraction (SPE). The extracted samples were analyzed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadruple time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF/MS/MS). A total of 14 metabolites were detected in invivo matrices. The PAB was metabolized via hydroxylation, oxidation, sulphation, N-dealkylation, acetylation and carbonylation pathways. A few of the metabolites were also detected in in vitro samples. Metabolite identification andcharacterization were performed by using UHPLC/Q-TOF/MS/MS in combination withHRMS data. To identify the toxicity potential of these metabolites, in silicotoxicity assessment was carried out using TOPKAT and DEREK softwares.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
