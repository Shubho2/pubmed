The area under thereceiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve were used toassess the original and updated models. Clinical usefulness of the model wasevaluated by false-negative rates (FNRs) at different cut-off points for thepredictive probability.RESULTS: Data from 1416 patients were analyzed. The AUC for the original modelwas 0.774. Patients were classified into four risk groups by GLM analysis, forwhich four updated models were created. The AUC for the updated models was 0.812.The calibration curves showed that the updated model predictions were better inagreement with actual observations than the original model predictions. FNRs ofthe updated models were lower than the preset 10% at all cut-off points when the predictive probability was less than 12.0%.CONCLUSIONS: The original model showed good performance in the Dutch validationpopulation. The updated models resulted in more accurate ALN metastasisprediction and could be useful preoperative tools in selecting low-risk patients for omission of axillary surgery.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
