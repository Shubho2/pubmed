One group received irradiation at a standard dose of 50 Gy in 25fractions and the other at a dose of 40.3 Gy in 13 fractions. Both totallymphocyte count and its composition were recorded at three timepoints: rightbefore the radiation treatment (T0), immediately after the last fraction ofradiotherapy (T1) and 6 months after irradiation therapy ended (T2).RESULTS: Both groups experienced temporal lymphopenia after finishing localradiation (T1) (13F T0 vs. T1 1570.6 ± 243.9 vs. 940.6 ± 141.8, **p < 0.01; 25FT0 vs. T1 1620.5 ± 280.2 vs. 948.5 ± 274.6, **p < 0.01), while the lymphocytecount recovered at follow-up time (T2), and the cell count in thehypofractionation group (13F) was higher than the standard fraction group (25F)(13F vs. 25F 1725.6 ± 225.6 vs. 1657.5 ± 242.4, *p < 0.05). With respect to thecomposition of lymphocyte, we found T cell, B cell, and NK cell reacteddifferently to different radiotherapy protocols.CONCLUSIONS: Different RT protocols impose different impacts on immunity, leadingus to further explore the optimal radiotherapy regimes to synergy withimmunotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1851-2 PMID: 29536332
