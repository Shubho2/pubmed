China.Aim of Study: The current meta-analysis investigated the correlation betweenbreast cancer type 1 (BRCA1) promoter methylation and the clinicopathologicalfeatures of breast cancer (BC).Materials and Methods: An electronic literature search was performed to identify and select cohort studies, by employing stringent inclusion and exclusioncriteria, for data relevant to promoter methylation of BRCA1 and BC. Statistical analysis of the extracted data was performed using comprehensive meta-analysis2.0 software (CMA 2.0) (Biostat Inc., Englewood, New Jersey, USA).Results: A total of 125 published studies were retrieved from the literaturesearch, and finally, 18 cohort studies meeting our inclusion criteria wereincorporated into our meta-analysis. The 18 studies contained a total of 3213 BC patients. Meta-analysis results revealed that BRCA1 promoter methylation in BCpatients with high and moderately differentiated tumors (I-II) was significantly lower than patients with poorly-differentiation tumors (III) (odds ratio [OR]=0.450, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] =0.241-0.838, P = 0.012). BRCA1 promotermethylation in BC patients with lymph node (LN) metastasis was significantlyhigher than patients without LN metastasis (OR = 2.244, 95% CI = 1.278-3.940, P =0.005). The results of ethnicity-based subgroup analysis showed a significantdifference in histological grade of BC on Asians, LN metastasis of BC in Asiansand Caucasians, subtypes of BC in Caucasians, and age at diagnosis of BC patientsin Caucasians (all P < 0.05).Conclusions: Our meta-analysis revealed that BRCA1 promoter methylation status islinked to tumor grade and LN metastasis of BC.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.235354 PMID: 29970689
