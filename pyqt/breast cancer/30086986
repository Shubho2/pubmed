The survey was sent to83 clinicians associated with the breast oncology disease center at our tertiary cancer center through an institutional e-mail list. The survey included 2questions about demographics and 8 statements inquiring the various aspects ofthe consultation service scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale. "1'' being "agreecompletely," "3" being "neutral/neither agree nor disagree," and "5" being"disagree completely." The survey was sent on line and was answered anonymously. Responses were tallied and analyzed.RESULTS: A total of 56 responses (67%) were received. The weighted average ofeach Likert item ranged from 1.07 to 1.58. Highest positive concordance (95%)pertained to the access to the consult radiologist having a positive impact onpatient care. The least concordant statement (78%), though still strong (withweighted average of 1.58% and 78% of respondents agreeing or agreeing completely)pertained to the role of direct consultation with radiologist in clinicalmanagement. Although there was variability of agreement to all statements(including responders feeling neutral), there was no one that disagreed with any of the Likert items. The mean Likert score for all the statements together was1.23 (range: 1.07-1.58).CONCLUSION: Presence of dedicated oncologic imaging consultation service isperceived positively by the breast oncology team at our tertiary cancer center.Copyright Â© 2018.
