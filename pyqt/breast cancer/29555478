Electronic address: eubreuer@luc.edu.Studies have shown that transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3), a key component of centrosome-microtubule dynamic networks, is significantly associatedwith various types of human cancer. We have recently reported that high levels ofTACC3 are found in breast cancer, lead to the accumulation of spontaneous DNAdamage due to defective DNA damage response signaling, and confer cellularsensitivity to radiation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.Although our study suggests a potential role of TACC3 as a biomarker in breastcancer detection and prediction of therapy outcome, its role as a therapeutictarget in breast cancer is not well studied. In this study, we show that a small molecule TACC3 inhibitor, KHS101, suppresses cell growth, motility,epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and breast cancer cell stemness while itinduces apoptotic cell death. Quantitative multiplexed proteomic analysis usingtandem mass tags (TMTs) revealed that KHS101 alters multiple biological processesand signaling pathways, and significantly reduces the expression of mitotickinases Aurora A and Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which are closely associated withTACC3. Our findings therefore provide a new insight into the potential mechanismsof the action of KHS101 and suggest its possible use as a dual or multi-targetingmitotic inhibitor in breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
