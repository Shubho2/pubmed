We used the nationwide SwedishFamily-Cancer Database for years 1958 to 2015 to analyse familial relative risks (RR) for 11,138 TC patients when first-degree relatives were diagnosed with TC orother cancer in reference to those without a family history. A total of 191familial TCs were found, which accounted for 2.0% of all TC. The RR was 5.06 whenone family member was diagnosed with TC with no significant difference betweenseminoma and nonseminoma. However, the risk for nonseminoma was 33.59 when twofamily members were affected. Internally consistent familial associations of TC, particularly of seminoma, were found with breast and nervous system cancers andmelanoma. Individual significant associations were found for a number of sites,including ovarian, endometrial and prostate cancers. Our results suggest thatnonseminoma may have a stronger genetic background than seminoma but seminomashares more familial associations with discordant cancers. Clustering of TC with hormone-dependent cancers of the breast, ovary, endometrium and prostate maysuggest mechanistic links and possibly gene-environment interactions.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-28819-7 PMCID: PMC6052159PMID: 30022029
