PKD1 has been previously shown to be a prognostic factor in ERα+tamoxifen-resistant breast tumors and PKD1 overexpression confers estrogenindependence to ERα+ MCF7 cells. In the present study, our goal was to determine whether PKD1 is a prognostic factor and/or a relevant therapeutic target inbreast cancer. We analyzed PRKD1 mRNA levels in 527 primary breast tumors. Wefound that high PRKD1 mRNA levels were significantly and independently associatedwith a low metastasis-free survival in the whole breast cancer population and in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype specifically. High PRKD1 mRNAlevels were also associated with a low overall survival in TNBC. We identifiednovel PKD1 inhibitors and assessed their antitumor activity in vitro in TNBC celllines and in vivo in a TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model.Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated depletion of PKD1 reduced colonyformation in MDA-MB-436 TNBC cells. PKD1 inhibition also reduced tumor growth in vivo in a TNBC PDX model. Together, these results establish PKD1 as a poorprognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25292 PMCID: PMC5955414PMID: 29796183
