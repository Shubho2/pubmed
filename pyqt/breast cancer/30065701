Germline CDKN1B pathogenic variants havebeen described in hereditary tumors, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia(MEN)-like syndromes and familial prostate cancer. Despite its central role intumor progression, for a long time it has been proposed that CDKN1B was veryrarely somatically mutated in human cancer and that its expression levels werealmost exclusively regulated at post-transcriptional level. Yet, the advent ofmassive parallel sequencing has partially subverted this general understandingdemonstrating that, at least in some types of cancer, CDKN1B is mutated in asignificant percentage of analyzed samples. Recent works have demonstrated thatCDKN1B can be genetically inactivated and this occurs particularly in sporadicluminal breast cancer, prostate cancer and small intestine neuroendocrine tumors.However, a clear picture of the extent and significance of CDKN1B mutations inhuman malignances is still lacking. To fill this gap, we interrogated the COSMIC,ICGC, cBioPortal, and TRANSFAC data portals and current literature in PubMed, andreviewed the mutational spectrum of CDKN1B in human cancers, interpreting thepossible impact of these mutations on p27Kip1 protein function and tumor onsetand progression.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00393 PMCID: PMC6056726PMID: 30065701
