Epub 2018 Mar15.In vitro assessment of the role of DpC in the treatment of head and neck squamouscell carcinoma.Xu YX(1), Zeng ML(2), Yu D(1), Ren J(1), Li F(1)(3), Zheng A(1), Wang YP(1), ChenC(1)(3), Tao ZZ(1)(2)(3).Author information: (1)Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Renmin Hospital of WuhanUniversity, Wuhan, Hubei 430060, P.R.

China.The present study aimed to investigate the antitumor efficacy ofdi-2-pyridylketone-4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (DpC) anddi-2-pyridylketone-4,4,-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) on head and necksquamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. The proliferation and apoptosis of HNSCCcells treated with the iron chelators DpC and Dp44mT were detected. The mechanismof DpC-induced apoptosis on HNSCC cells was investigated. The human HNSCC celllines FaDu, Cal-27 and SCC-9 were cultured in vitro and exposed to gradientconcentrations of DpC and Dp44mT. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to detect the viability of FaDu, Cal-27, SCC-9 cells. Double staining with annexin V andpropidium iodide was performed for the detection of the proportion of apoptoticFaDu, Cal-27 and SCC-9 cells following treatment. The nuclear damage to Cal-27cells that were treated with DpC was detected by Hoechst staining. Finally,western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of proteins associatedwith the DNA damage pathway in Cal-27 cells that were treated with DpC. The CCK-8assay showed that treatment with DpC and Dp44mT was able to markedly inhibit the viability of FaDu, Cal-27 and SCC-9 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Incomparison to Dp44mT, treatment with DpC exhibited a more effective inhibitoryeffect on the viability of HNSCC cells. The proportion of apoptotic cellsdetected by flow cytometry increased in a dose-dependent manner in all cell linesfollowing DpC and Dp44mT treatment, with the proportion of apoptotic HNSCC cells induced by DpC treatment being significantly higher compared with Dp44mT(P<0.05). The results of Hoechst staining revealed that the nuclei of Cal-27cells exhibited morphological changes in response to DpC treatment, includingkaryopyknosis and nuclear fragmentation. The expression of DNA damage-associated proteins, including phosphorylated (p)-serine-protein kinase ATM,p-serine/threonine-protein kinase Chk1 (p-Chk-1), p-serine/threonine-proteinkinase ATR (p-ATR), p-Chk-2, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, p-histone H2AX, breastcancer type 1 susceptibility protein, p-tumor protein P53, increased withincreasing concentration of DpC in Cal-27 cells. Treatment with DpC and Dp44mTmarkedly inhibited cell viability and increased the apoptotic rates in humanHNSCC cells in a concentration-dependent manner. DpC exhibited a strongerantitumor effect compared with Dp44mT, potentially inducing the apoptosis ofHNSCC cells via the upregulation of DNA damage repair-associated proteins.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8279 PMCID: PMC5934731PMID: 29740495
