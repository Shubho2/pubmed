Saha Road, Kolkata, West Bengal, 700053, India.Flavonoid metal ion complexes have been deliberated in recent years and areconsidered as a new class of medicinal agents with enhanced therapeutic activity and low toxicity. Our study deals with chemotherapeutic effects of vanadium, whencoordinated with the flavonoid quercetin on a defined model of chemically inducedrat mammary carcinogenesis in vivo and on human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in vitro. The characterization of the complex was achieved through UV-Visible, IR,and Mass spectra and antioxidant activity was assessed by DPPH, FRAP and ABTSmethods. In vitro studies established that the complex upregulated theexpressions of p53, Caspase 3 and 9, whereas down regulating Akt, mTOR and VEGFexpressions and also induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in a dose dependent manner. Acute and Sub-acute toxicity was performed to determine safe doses.7,12-Dimethylbenz(α)anthracene (0.5 mg/100 g body weight) was used for induction of breast cancer in female Sprague-Dawley rats via single tail vein injection.The histopathological analysis after 24 weeks of carcinogenesis study depictedsubstantial repair of hyperplastic lesions. TUNEL assay showed an increase inapoptotic index (0.14 ± 0.03; 0.15 ± 0.01) in vanadium-quercetin treated groupsas compared to the carcinogen control (0.02 ± 0.01) along with upregulation ofBcl-2 and downregulation of Bax and p53. Immunohistochemical analysis alsoexhibited decrease in cell proliferation in the vanadium-quercetin treated groups(11.3 ± 0.12; 11.8 ± 0.10). Thus, results from both in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that vanadium-quercetin complex could be a potential candidate fordevelopment of approved drug for breast cancer in the near future.DOI: 10.1007/s10534-018-0117-3 PMID: 29855745
