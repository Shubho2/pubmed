As DPP-4 is a rather unselective enzyme present in manytissues, we focused on all specific cancer types. PubMed and EMBASE were searchedbetween January 2005 and April 2017 to identify studies comparing DPP-4inhibitors with either placebo or active drugs on cancer risk. Studies wereincluded if they reported on at least one specific cancer outcome and had afollow-up of at least 1 year after start of drug use. Methodological quality ofthe studies was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and theNewcastle-Ottawa Scale. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (12randomized controlled trials and 13 observational studies). Sample sizes of theDPP-4 inhibitor groups ranged from 29 to 8212 patients for randomized controlled trials and from 2422 to 71 137 patients for observational studies. Mean ageranged from 51 to 76 years, and mean follow-up was 1.5 years. None of the pooled (sensitivity) analyses, except the observational studies studying breast cancer(hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.76 [0.60-0.96]), showed evidence for an associationbetween DPP-4 inhibitors and site-specific cancer. Also for pancreatic andthyroid cancer, no statistically significant risk was found. Based on the currentliterature, it is not possible to conclude whether DPP-4 inhibitors wereassociated with an increased risk of site-specific cancer. Future studies should address the methodological limitations and follow patients for a longer period todetermine the long-term cancer risk of DPP-4 inhibitors.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/dmrr.3004 PMID: 29573125
