Despite the growing use of phylogenetics in cancer studies, though, thefield has only slowly adapted to many ways that tumor evolution differs fromclassic species evolution. One crucial question in that regard is how to handleinference of structural variations (SVs), which are a major mechanism ofevolution in cancers but have been largely neglected in tumor phylogenetics todate, in part due to the challenges of reliably detecting and typing SVs andinterpreting them phylogenetically.Results: We present a novel method for reconstructing evolutionary trajectoriesof SVs from bulk whole-genome sequence data via joint deconvolution andphylogenetics, to infer clonal sub-populations and reconstruct their ancestry. Weestablish a novel likelihood model for joint deconvolution and phylogeneticinference on bulk SV data and formulate an associated optimization algorithm. We demonstrate the approach to be efficient and accurate for realistic scenarios of SV mutation on simulated data. Application to breast cancer genomic data from TheCancer Genome Atlas shows it to be practical and effective at reconstructingfeatures of SV-driven evolution in single tumors.Availability and implementation: Python source code and associated documentation are available at https://github.com/jaebird123/tusv.DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty270 PMCID: PMC6022719PMID: 29950001
