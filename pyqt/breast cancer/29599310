The present study investigated the effects of targeted radionuclide therapy with α-emitting, bone-seeking radium-224 (224Ra) onosteolytic bone metastasis of MDA-MB-231(SA)-GFP human breast cancer cellsinjected intracardially into nude mice.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vehicle, ethylenediamine tetra (methylene phosphonic acid)(EDTMP) and 224Ra-solution (45, 91 or 179 kBq/kg) with EDTMP were intravenouslyadministered to mice two days after cell injection. The bone-seeking EDTMP wasadded to the 224Ra-solution to improve bone targeting of 212Pb, which is aprogeny of 224Ra.RESULTS: Radium-224 solution treatment decreased in a dose-dependent manner theareas of osteolytic lesions in the hind limbs and the number of tumor foci in thewhole skeleton, and extended survival. Paraplegia was not observed in 179 kBq/kg 224Ra-solution group.CONCLUSION: Radium-224-solution containing chelated 212Pb is a promisingcandidate for the treatment of breast cancer patients with bone metastases.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12432 PMID: 29599310  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
