Metastatic involvement of the duodenal bulb is extremely rare anddifficult to detect by endoscopy.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 51-year-old menopausal woman presented with abdominalfullness and obstructive symptoms, and was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in theduodenal bulb. The patient had undergone modified radical mastectomy of the left breast for infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) 8 years previously.DIAGNOSIS: Metastatic infiltration of the duodenal bulb originating from IDC was proven histologically and immunohistochemically.INTERVENTIONS: She received chemotherapy with docetaxel and capecitabine followedby hormone maintenance therapy with letrozole after operation.OUTCOMES: After treatment, the patient recovered well. She is currently beingfollowed up.LESSONS: Patients with known breast cancer history with the IDC histological typeand presenting with nonspecific abdominal symptoms or signs, such as abdominalfullness, nausea, and vomiting, should undergo endoscopy with histopathologicalexamination in order to detect possible gastrointestinal metastasis of theprimary breast tumor. This report intends to alert people to heed this type ofbreast cancer metastasis and not treat it as a primary gastrointestinal tumor.Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors.
