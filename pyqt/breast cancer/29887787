In fact, it has been estimated that about one-third of breast cancercases are attributable to factors women can change. Most research has focused on examining the impact of one single exposure on breast cancer risk while adjustingfor other risk modifiers. Capitalizing on big data, major efforts have been made to evaluate the combined impact of well-established lifestyle factors on overall breast cancer risk. At the individual level, data indicate that even simplebehavior modifications could have a considerable impact on breast cancerprevention. Moreover, there is emerging new evidence that adopting a healthylifestyle may be particularly relevant for women with hereditary susceptibilityto breast cancer. On the absolute risk scale, studies suggest that the presenceof certain risk factors, such as excessive body weight, had a substantiallyhigher impact on breast cancer risk if women had a hereditary predisposition tocancer. The existing body of knowledge gives the medical professionals guidanceas to which factors to focus on when counseling patients. However, well-designed randomized controlled trials utilizing objective methods are crucial to providingconcrete recommendations.DOI: 10.1159/000488995 PMCID: PMC5981672 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29887787
