Two reviewers extracted study information and assessed studyquality. Meta-analysis was performed.RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies representing a total of 12,676 imaging secondaryinterpretations met inclusion criteria; 19 of these studies provided dataspecifically for oncologic imaging examinations. Primary risks of bias includedavailability of initial interpretations, other clinical information, andreference standard before the secondary interpretation. The overall discrepancyrate of secondary interpretations compared with primary interpretations was32.2%, including a 20.4% discrepancy rate for major findings. Secondaryinterpretations were management changing in 18.6% of cases. Among discrepantinterpretations with an available reference standard, the secondaryinterpretation accuracy rate was 90.5%. The overall discrepancy rates byexamination types were 28.3% for CT, 31.2% for MRI, 32.7% for oncologic imaging, 43.8% for body imaging, 39.9% for breast imaging, 34.0% for musculoskeletalimaging, 23.8% for neuroradiologic imaging, 35.5% for pediatric imaging, and19.7% for trauma imaging.CONCLUSION: Most widely studied in the context of oncology, imaging secondaryinterpretations commonly result in discrepant interpretations that are managementchanging and more accurate than initial interpretations. Policymakers shouldconsider these findings as they consider the value of, and payment for, secondaryimaging interpretations.Copyright Â© 2018 American College of Radiology. Published by Elsevier Inc.
