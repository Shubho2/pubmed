Mutations in the oncogene, PIK3CA, are frequently observed in breast cancer and have been suggested as a predictive biomarker for PI3K-selectiveinhibitor treatment. In this study, we analyzed the presence of PIK3CA mutations in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, metastatic tissue and corresponding ctDNAfrom serum of patients with advanced breast cancer using a highly sensitive,optimized droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay. We found 83% of patients with PIK3CAmutation in the metastatic tumor tissue also had detectable PIK3CA mutations inserum ctDNA. Patients lacking the PIK3CA mutation in corresponding serum ctDNAall had nonvisceral metastatic disease. Four patients with detectablePIK3CA-mutated ctDNA were followed with an additional serum sample duringoncological treatment. In all cases, changes in PIK3CA ctDNA level correlatedwith treatment response. Our results showed high concordance between detection ofPIK3CA mutations in tumor tissue and in corresponding serum ctDNA and suggestthat serum samples from patients with advanced breast cancer and ddPCR may beused for PIK3CA mutation status assessment to complement imaging techniques as anearly marker of treatment response.© 2018 The Authors.
