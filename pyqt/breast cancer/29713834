Since exosomes are now being utilized as delivery vehicles for exogenous therapeutic cargoes, their intrinsicproperties and biological effects must be understood. We performed miRNAprofiling and found substantial differences in the miRNA landscape of prostatecancer (PC3) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 exosomes with littlecorrelation in abundance of common miRNAs (R2 = 0.16). Using a systems-levelbioinformatics approach, the most abundant miRNAs in PC3 exosomes but not HEKexosomes were predicted to significantly modulate integrin signaling, withintegrin-β3 loss inducing macrophage M2 polarization. PC3 but not HEK exosomesdownregulated integrin-β3 expression levels by 70%. There was a dose-dependentpolarization of RAW 264.7 macrophages toward an M2 phenotype when treated withPC3-derived exosomes but not HEK-derived exosomes. Conversely, HEK exosomes,widely utilized as delivery vehicles, were predicted to target cadherinsignaling, with experimental validation showing a significant increase in themigratory potential of MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with HEK exosomes. Evenwidely utilized exosomes are unlikely to be inert, and their intrinsic activityought to be assessed before therapeutic deployment.DOI: 10.1208/s12248-018-0227-4 PMID: 29713834
