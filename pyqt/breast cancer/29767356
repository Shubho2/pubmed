Wediscuss factors that impact expression data generation and analysis that whichshould be considered in the application of these technology platforms. We furtherpresent the results of a simple illustration study to highlight performancesimilarities and differences in expression profiling of protein-coding mRNAs witheach platform. Based on technical and analytical differences between the twoplatforms, reports in the literature comparing arrays and RNA-Seq for geneexpression, and our own example study and experience, we provide recommendations for platform selection for gene expression studies.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7834-2_2 PMID: 29767356
