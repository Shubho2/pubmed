The usual methodology is biopsy with a needle,either fine needle aspiration or core biopsy. The guidance is under CT or U/S.Fine needle aspiration has usually small diameter in comparison to the corebiopsy. In any case the radiologist will choose the appropriate method based onthe site of the lesion and safety of the patient. Pneumothorax and hemothorax areadverse effects that can be managed either on site with the help of a smallcatheter, however; there are cases where video-assisted thoracic surgery isneeded in order to manage a more severe case. In the current study we presentsuch a case where video-assisted surgery was necessary.DOI: 10.1016/j.rmcr.2018.06.008 PMCID: PMC6019816PMID: 30013911
