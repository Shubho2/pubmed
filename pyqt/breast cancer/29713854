Various stratified analyses were performed according to race (Asian/Westerner), HRT type [all hormonetherapies, estrogen-only therapy (ET), or combined estrogen-progestin therapy(EPT)], histological breast cancer type (ductal/lobular/mixed ductal-lobular),and estrogen receptor status (ER-positive/ER-negative).METHODS: A literature search was performed using Pubmed, Embase, and KoreaMed.Twenty-five epidemiological studies including 23 cohort studies and tworandomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis.RESULTS: Using a random-effects model, HRT use was found to be positivelyassociated with the risk of breast cancer with a pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 1.33[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24, 1.44]. Compared with ET, EPT was morestrongly associated with breast cancer risk. EPT was associated with both ductal and lobular breast cancer risks [for ductal breast cancer, HR = 1.51 (95% CI1.28, 1.78); for lobular breast cancer, HR = 1.38 (95% CI 1.20, 1.60)]. Accordingto ER status, all HRTs were associated with the risk of ER-positive breastcancer, but not with that of ER-negative breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Asian HRT users had a higher risk of breast cancer than western HRT users. Both ET and EPT were significantly associated with the risk of all breast cancer histological types and ER-positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4782-2 PMID: 29713854
