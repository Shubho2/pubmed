Integration of the 47 most upregulated genes (log FC > 1,FDR < 0.03) in letrozole-resistant tumors with transcription-binding data showed significant overlap with 20 E2F4-regulated genes (P = 2.56E-15). In patientstreated with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib before surgery, treatmentsignificantly decreased expression of 24 of the 47 most upregulated genes inletrozole-resistant tumors, including 18 of the 20 E2F4 target genes. Inlong-term estrogen-deprived ER+ breast cancer cells, palbociclib alsodownregulated all 20 E2F4 target genes and P-RB levels, whereas the ERdownregulator fulvestrant or paclitaxel only partially suppressed expression ofthis set of genes and had no effect on P-RB. Finally, an E2F4 activationsignature was strongly associated with resistance to aromatase inhibitors in the ACOSOG Z1031B neoadjuvant trial and with an increased risk of relapse inadjuvant-treated ER+ tumors in METABRIC.Conclusions: In tumors resistant toprolonged neoadjuvant letrozole, we identified a gene expression signature ofE2F4 target activation. CDK4/6 inhibition suppressed E2F4 target gene expression in estrogen-deprived ER+ breast cancer cells and in patients' ER+ tumors,suggesting a potential benefit of adjuvant CDK4/6 inhibitors in patients with ER+breast cancer who fail to respond to preoperative estrogen deprivation.
