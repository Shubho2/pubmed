Incidence of lung, breast,and colon cancer by voivodeships in 2014 was calculated based on Polish National Cancer Registry. Socioeconomic variables in individual voivodeships were assessedbased on Polish Social Cohesion Survey for 2015. Spearman's rank correlationcoefficient was used to test the association of incidence rates and socioeconomicvariables. The significance level was set at p < 0.05 (two-tailed tests).RESULTS: Statistically significant negative correlation exists between: (1)friend-/neighbour-based social capital and colon and breast cancer, (2)association-based social capital and lung cancer, (3) high religiousness and lungand breast cancer, and (4) income poverty and breast cancer. Statisticallysignificant positive correlation exists between: (1) social isolation, livingconditions poverty, poverty resulting from the lack of budget balance, and lungcancer; (2) low/no involvement in religious activity and lung and breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support public health concerns over the implication of socioeconomic environment for cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s00038-018-1082-x PMID: 29508013
