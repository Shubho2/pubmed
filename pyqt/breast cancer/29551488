Electronic address: xyshi@126.com.BACKGROUND: The bi-directional solid fermentation product extract of Trametesrobiniophila Murr (Huaier) with Radix Isatidis (TIF) has been shown to have good anti-tumor activity. However, the mechanisms of this activity are still unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate its inhibitory effect on bothSK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and explore the possible mechanisms of itsanti-cancer effect in vitro.METHODS: The experiment comprised a control group, Radix Isatidis group, Huaiergroup, and TIF group. The cell viability was measured by MTT and the distributionof cell cycle and apoptosis levels were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell scratch,Transwell, and adhesion assays were used to measure the effects of the testcompounds on the migration, invasion, and adhesion capability of SK-BR-3 andMDA-MB-231 cells. The effects of TIF on the mRNA and protein expression relatedto apoptosis and migration were measured by using semi-quantitative RT-PCR andwestern blotting.RESULTS: TIF strongly inhibited the cell proliferation of the SK-BR-3 andMDA-MB-231 cells in a time-dependent manner and induced G2/M arrest andapoptosis. Furthermore, TIF significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration,invasion, and adhesion capabilities of SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Comparedwith other treatments, the anticancer effect of TIF were stronger inMDA-MB-231 cells. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR suggested that TIF may upregulate the expression of p53 and caspase-3 to inhibit cell proliferation, and downregulatethe expression of MMP-9/Snail and MMP-9/MMP-2 to inhibit the migration, invasion,and adhesion capabilities of SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blottingresults showed that TIF increased the expression of p53 protein and decreased theexpression of MMP-9 protein in SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells.CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the bi-directional solid fermentation may enhance the efficacy of Huaier in MDA-MB-231 cells and that TIF may be aneffective complementary medicine for cancer treatment.Copyright © 2018.
