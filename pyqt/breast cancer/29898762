The purpose of this study was toidentify an early treatment window for predicting pCR based on tumor subtype,pretreatment total hemoglobin (tHb) level, and early changes in tHb followingNAC.METHODS: Twenty-two patients (mean age 56 years, range 34-74 years) were assessedusing a near-infrared imager coupled with an Ultrasound system prior totreatment, 7 days after the first treatment, at the end of each of the firstthree cycles, and before their definitive surgery. Pathologic responses weredichotomized by the Miller-Payne system. Tumor vascularity was assessed from tHb;vascularity changes during NAC were assessed from a percentage tHb normalized to the pretreatment level (%tHb). After training the logistic prediction modelsusing the previous study data, we assessed the early treatment window forpredicting pathological response according to their tumor subtype (humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER),triple-negative (TN)) based on tHb, and %tHb measured at different cycles andevaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve(AUC).RESULTS: In the new study cohort, maximum pretreatment tHb and %tHb changes aftercycles 1, 2, and 3 were significantly higher in responder Miller-Payne 4-5 tumors(n = 13) than non-or partial responder Miller-Payne 1-3 tumors (n = 9). However, no significance was found at day 7. The AUC of the predictive power ofpretreatment tHb in the cohort was 0.75, which was similar to the performance of the HER2 subtype as a single predictor (AUC of 0.78). A greater predictive power of pretreatment tHb was found within each subtype, with AUCs of 0.88, 0.69, and0.72, in the HER2, ER, and TN subtypes, respectively. Using pretreatment tHb and cycle 1 %tHb, AUC reached 0.96, 0.91, and 0.90 in HER2, ER, and TN subtypes,respectively, and 0.95 regardless of subtype. Additional cycle 2 %tHbmeasurements moderately improved prediction for the HER2 subtype but did notimprove prediction for the ER and TN subtypes.CONCLUSIONS: By combining tumor subtypes with tHb, we predicted the pCR of breastcancer to NAC before treatment. Prediction accuracy can be significantly improvedby incorporating cycle 1 and 2 %tHb for the HER2 subtype and cycle 1 %tHb for theER and TN subtypes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02092636 .
