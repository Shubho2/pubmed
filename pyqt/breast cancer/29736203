MiR-520d-3p has been reported as a tumor suppressor gene in ovariancancer and gastric cancer, while the function of miR-520d-3p in human breastcancers is still uninvolved. In this study, we initially identified that theexpression of miR-520d-3p was significantly reduced in breast cancer specimensand cell lines. The restoration of miR-520d-3p expression not only reduced breastcancer cell viability by causing the accumulation of G2 phase and cell apoptosis,but also inhibited tumorigenicity in vivo. In addition, as a critical target ofmiR-520d-3p, the activity of spindle and kinetochore associated 2 (SKA2) wasgreatly inhibited by miR-520d-3p, and overexpression of miR-520d-3p decreased theexpression of SKA2. SKA2 downregulation suppressed cell viability, whereasrestoration of SKA2 expression significantly reversed the inhibitory effects ofmiR-520d-3p antitumor activity. Furthermore, SKA2 was frequently overexpressed inclinical specimens and cell lines, and the expression levels were statisticallyinversely correlated with miR-520d-3p expression. In conclusion, our datademonstrated that miR-520d-3p antitumor activity is achieved by targeting theSKA2 in human breast cancer cells, suggesting that miR-520d-3p may be a potentialtarget molecule for the therapy.PMCID: PMC5934569PMID: 29736203
