We report here nineadditional cases of this tumor, and we describe its morphologic,immunohistochemical and molecular profile in comparison to other types ofpapillary and micropapillary lesions of the breast that are intraductal papillomawith usual ductal hyperplasia, encapsulated papillary carcinoma, solid papillary carcinoma and invasive micropapillary carcinoma. We studied nine cases of thisspecial papillary tumor and six of each other types mentioned above. We foundthat solid papillary carcinoma with reverse polarity harbor specific morphologic features as cuboid or tall cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasms located atthe basal pole giving the impression of reverse nuclear polarity. Nuclei weresometimes grooved. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the lack of myoepithelialcells, as in encapsulated papillary carcinoma and solid papillary carcinoma,questioning their invasive nature. Seven of nine solid papillary carcinoma withreverse polarity showed a low Ki67 proliferative index (Ki67 <5%). They showedexpression of CK5/6 as in intraductal papilloma with usual ductal hyperplasia.They showed expression of calretinin and a low or lack of hormonal receptor (HR) expression that were not observed in other breast tumors studied. By whole-exome analysis, seven of nine solid papillary carcinomas with reverse polarity (78%)harbored a hotspot mutation in IDH2 (R172) that was totally absent in othergroups. Six of nine tumors (67%) also harbored PRUNE2 mutation, including the twoIDH2 wild-type cases. We also demonstrated for the first time in this breasttumor, immunostaining with a specific antibody IDH1/2 mutant R132/R172 (7/9) thatcan highlight IDH2 mutation. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis showed thatproteoglycan pathway was significantly enriched. Our findings support the factthat solid papillary carcinoma with reverse polarity is a singular breastneoplasm that can be distinguished from other papillary breast tumors.DOI: 10.1038/s41379-018-0047-1 PMID: 29785016
