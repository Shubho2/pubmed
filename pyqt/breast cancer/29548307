Most patients regularly visitcommunity pharmacies for health information and also seek advice from pharmacistswith respect to signs and symptoms of cancer. As readily accessible health careprofessionals, community pharmacists are also in the best position to includecancer-screening initiatives into their practice. Pharmacists are therefore in a good position to raise awareness when they counsel people who buyover-the-counter medication for the control of possible cancer-related symptoms. The aim of this review was to critically appraise evidence gathered from studies that; (1) explore or assess knowledge of community pharmacist on signs andsymptoms of cancer, (2) explore or assess knowledge of community pharmacist oncancer screening.METHODS: EMBASE (ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and MEDLINE (EBSCOhost) weresystematically searched for studies conducted between 2005 to July 2017. Studies that focused on knowledge of community pharmacist in cancer screening, signs and symptoms were included.RESULTS: A total of 1538 articles were identified from the search, of which 4 outof the 28 potentially relevant abstracts were included in the review. Findings ofthe selected studies revealed lack of sufficient knowledge on breast cancerscreening, signs and symptoms. Both studies attributed knowledge limitation asthe cause of reason for the key findings of their studies.CONCLUSION: The selected studies focused largely on breast cancer, which hinderthe generalizability and transferability of the findings. Hence there is a needfor more studies to be conducted in this area to draw a better conclusion.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4195-y PMCID: PMC5857088PMID: 29548307
