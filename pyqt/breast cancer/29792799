R. China.Many cancers, such as human breast cancer and lung cancer, easily metastasize to bones, leading to the formation of secondary tumors in advanced stages. On thebasis of the CD44-targeted effect of oHA and the bone-targeted effect of ALN, we prepared a reduction-responsive, CD44 receptor-targeting and bone-targetingnanomicelle, called CUR-loaded ALN-oHA-S-S-CUR micelles. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the antitumor activity and bone-targeting ability of CUR-loadedALN-oHA-S-S-CUR micelles. The in vivo experiment results showed that a largernumber of micelles was gathered in the bone metastatic tumor tissue and reducedthe bone destruction. The CUR-loaded ALN-oHA-S-S-CUR micelles markedly inhibited the tumor growth. So the CUR-loaded ALN-oHA-S-S-CUR micelles constitute apromising drug delivery system for bone tumor therapy.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00266 PMID: 29792799
