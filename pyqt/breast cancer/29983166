Electronic address:heiko.hayen@uni-muenster.de.Changes in lipid composition of cells or tissue are often linked to variousdiseases. Studies indicate alterations of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP)species in diseases such as cancer. Therefore, an extended phospholipid profilingmethod based on hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and data-dependent MS/MS acquisition wasdeveloped to separate and unambiguously identify BMP species. Lipid speciesidentification was based on retention time, accurate mass and specific MS/MSfragments. The developed method was applied in a proof of concept study to lipid extracts of a cell culture model of conditional oncogene overexpression inMCF-7/NeuT breast cancer cells. Comparison of control and oncogene-inducedMCF-7/NeuT breast cancer cells showed changes in BMP species distribution.Thereby, a shift from long-chain to shorter-chain fatty acid composition in BMPspecies was detected.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
