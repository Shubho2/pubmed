Modern treatment strategies have reduced possible skin injury, but few clinical studies have addressed the dose relationship between radiation exposure and skinreaction. This prospective clinical study analyzes skin oxygenation/perfusion in patients undergoing fractionated breast conserving therapy via hyperspectralimaging (HSI).Methods: Forty-three women undergoing breast conserving therapy were enrolled in this study. Optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters (OSLDs) measuredradiation exposure in four sites: treatment breast, lumpectomy scar, medialtattoo and the control breast. The oxygenation/perfusion states of these siteswere prospectively imaged before and after each treatment fraction with HSI.Visual skin reactions were classified according to the RTOG system.Results: 2753 observations were obtained and indicated a dose-responserelationship between radiation exposure and oxygenated hemoglobin (OxyHb) after a600Â cGy cumulative dose threshold. There was a relatively weak associationbetween DeoxyHb and radiation exposure. Results suggest strong correlationsbetween changes in mean OxyHb and skin reaction as well as between radiationexposure and changes in skin reaction.Conclusion: HSI demonstrates promise in the assessment of skin dose as well as anobjective measure of skin reaction. The ability to easily identify adverse skinreactions and to modify the treatment plan may circumvent the need fordetrimental treatment breaks.DOI: 10.1016/j.ctro.2017.03.003 PMCID: PMC5833900PMID: 29594203
