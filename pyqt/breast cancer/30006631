Genomic studies suggest that a subset of OS, including OS tumour celllines (TCLs), exhibit genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) patterns reminiscentof BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutant tumours. This raises the possibility that PARPinhibitors (PARPi), used to treat BRCA1/2 mutant cancers, could be used to targetOS. Using high-throughput drug sensitivity screening we generatedchemosensitivity profiles for 79 small molecule inhibitors, including threeclinical PARPi. Drug screening was performed in 88 tumour cell lines, including18 OS TCLs. This identified known sensitivity effects in OS TCLs, such assensitivity to FGFR inhibitors. When compared to BRCA1/2 mutant TCLs, OS TCLs,with the exception of LM7, were PARPi resistant, including those with previously determined BRCAness LoH profiles. Post-screen validation experiments confirmedPARPi sensitivity in LM7 cells as well as a defect in the ability to form nuclearRAD51 foci in response to DNA damage. LM7 provides one OS model for the study of PARPi sensitivity through a potential defect in RAD51-mediated DNA repair. Thedrug sensitivity dataset we generated in 88 TCLs could also serve as a resourcefor the study of drug sensitivity effects in OS.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29043-z PMCID: PMC6045584PMID: 30006631
