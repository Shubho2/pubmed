We recently showedthat olaparib at clinically achievable concentrations exerts anti-proliferativeand pro-apoptotic effects in vitro as monotherapy against primary acute myeloidleukemia (AML) blasts, while sparing normal bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic cells.Since AML expresses low levels of death receptors that may contribute toapoptosis resistance, in this study we investigated whether the anti-leukemiaactivity of olaparib involves modulation of FAS and TRAIL receptors DR5 and DR4. Our data show that the primary AML samples tested express FAS and DR5 transcriptsat levels lower than normal BM. In this context, apoptosis triggered by olaparib is associated with a dose-dependent up-regulation of death receptors expressionand caspase 8 activation. Olaparib-mediated FAS up-regulation requires NF-κBactivation, as indicated by the increase of p65 phosphorylation and decrease ofIκBα. Moreover, FAS up-regulation is abrogated by pretreatment of AML cells with two different NF-κB inhibitors. These results indicate that NF-κB activation and consequent induction of death receptor expression contribute to the anti-leukemiaeffect of olaparib in AML.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
