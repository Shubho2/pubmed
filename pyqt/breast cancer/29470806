In the Indian population, the healthcare burden of breastand/or ovarian cancers has been steadily rising, thus stressing the need forearly detection, surveillance, and disease management measures. However, theburden attributable to inherited mutations is not well characterized.METHODS: We sequenced 1010 unrelated patients and families from across India withan indication of breast and/or ovarian cancers, using the TruSight Cancer panelwhich includes 14 genes, strongly associated with risk of hereditary breastand/or ovarian cancers. Genetic variations were identified using the StrandNGSsoftware and interpreted using the StrandOmics platform.RESULTS: We were able to detect mutations in 304 (30.1%) cases, of which, 56mutations were novel. A majority (84.9%) of the mutations were detected in theBRCA1/2 genes as compared to non-BRCA genes (15.1%). When the cases werestratified on the basis of age at diagnosis and family history of cancer, thehigh rate of 75% of detection of hereditary variants was observed in patientswhose age at diagnosis was below 40Â years and had first-degree family member(s)affected by breast and/or ovarian cancers. Our findings indicate that in theIndian population, there is a high prevalence of mutations in the high-riskbreast cancer genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and PALB2.CONCLUSION: In India, socioeconomic inequality limiting access to treatment is a major factor towards increased cancer burden; therefore, incorporation of acost-effective and comprehensive multi-gene test will be helpful in ensuringwidespread implementation of genetic screening in the clinical practice forhereditary breast and/or ovarian cancers.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4726-x PMID: 29470806
