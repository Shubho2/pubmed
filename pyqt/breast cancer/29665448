Dataof women with VABB-diagnosed pure FEA who underwent either excisional surgery or mammographic follow-up were analyzed. Cases with mass lesions or ipsilateralcancers were excluded. Two pathologists (FA,PM) reviewed the results ofprocedures performed. Clinical, radiological, as well as histological criteriahave been studied in order to determine the correlation between these factors andcarcinoma underestimation.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: This study included 70 cases of pure FEA. Twenty womenunderwent surgical excision and 50 had clinical and mammographic surveillanceonly. In three women FEA was upgraded to breast cancer on excision. Clinical and mammographic follow-up for a mean of 56 months ± 27 in the group without excisionshowed two cancers in the same breast (Intermediate grade DCIS, and invasiveductal carcinoma 84 and 48 months respectively after VABB). Three factors weresignificantly predictive of underestimation or occurence of cancer for pure FEAwhen the radiologic lesions are calcifications: age≥ 57 years, radiologic size>10 mm and number of FEA foci ≥4.Copyright © 2018.
