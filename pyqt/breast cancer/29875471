Proportions of local and systemic treatments, five-year relative survival and relative excess risks (RER) between countries were calculated.RESULTS: In total, 236,015 patients were included. The proportion of stage I BCreceiving endocrine therapy ranged from 19.6% (Netherlands) to 84.6% (Belgium).The proportion of stage III BC receiving no breast surgery varied between 22.0%(Belgium) and 50.8% (Ireland). For stage I BC, relative survival was lower inEngland compared with Belgium (RER 2.96, 95%CI 1.30-6.72, P < .001). For stageIII BC, England, Ireland and Greater Poland showed significantly worse relativesurvival compared with Belgium.CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variation in treatment strategies and survival outcomes in elderly with BC in Europe. For early-stage BC, we observed largevariation in endocrine therapy but no variation in relative survival, suggesting potential overtreatment. For advanced BC, we observed higher survival incountries with lower proportions of omission of surgery, suggesting potentialundertreatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0090-1 PMID: 29875471
