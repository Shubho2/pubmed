Thisstudy aims to describe the monthly trends of EOL medical care, drug therapy, and chemotherapy costs per patient with cancer in the last year of life in theinpatients vs. outpatient setting for the 13 most prevalent cancers in Korea.METHODS: Using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA)database, we identified the patients who had been treated for the primarydiagnoses of one of the 13 most prevalent cancers in Korea and died betweenJanuary 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. We calculated the mean monthly costs ofmedical care, drug therapy, and chemotherapy per patient in the last year of lifeby cancer site and patient setting (inpatient vs. outpatient).RESULTS: For most cancers, the monthly inpatient costs per patient remain stable or increased gradually from 12 months to 3 months prior to death and thenincreased steeply from 2 months prior to death. The mean monthly inpatient costs per patient were highest for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) throughout the lastyear of life; all solid tumors had similar trends of monthly inpatient costs. Themean monthly inpatient costs for AML increased from $5,465 (SD, $5,248) in 12months prior to death to $15,033 (SD, $11,864) in the last month. The monthlyoutpatient costs per patient showed similar, gradually decreasing trends for mostcancers. The mean outpatient costs were highest for kidney cancer; the costssharply decreased from $954 (SD, $1,346) in 12 months prior to death to $424 (SD,$736) in the last month. The proportion of inpatients receiving chemotherapy inthe last month of life was highest for AML (77%), followed by liver cancer (67%) and breast cancer (56%).CONCLUSION: The monthly inpatient medical care costs per patient with cancerincreased as the patient approached death, while the monthly outpatient costsdecreased. A considerable proportion of inpatient received chemotherapy in thelast month of life. Efforts are needed to optimize EOL care for cancer patients.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197891 PMCID: PMC5991689PMID: 29879136
