Although there are only few data fromprospective randomized trials, results of retrospective studies suggest adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab may improve outcomes of patients with pT1a-b pN0HER2-positive breast cancer. On the other hand, trastuzumab is potentiallyassociated with increased cardiac toxicity, especially when combined withanthracycline-based chemotherapy. A valid strategy for improving cardiac safetyis the addition of trastuzumab to non-anthracycline chemotherapy, whereas ashorter duration of trastuzumab should be not routinely considered although mightrepresent an option for selected patients at low risk of relapse and very highrisk of cardiac events. Therefore, the choice of adjuvant treatment for patients with pT1a-b pN0 HER2-positive breast cancer should be done on individual basis,carefully weighing benefits and risks.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
