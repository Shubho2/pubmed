Electronic address: yuanzhu@scu.edu.cn.PTEN deficiency often causes defects in DNA damage repair. Currently, effectivetherapies for breast cancer are lacking. ATM is an attractive target for cancertreatment. Previous studies suggested a synthetic lethality between PTEN andPARP. However, the synthetically lethal interaction between PTEN and ATM inbreast cancer has not been reported. Moreover, the mechanism remains elusive.Here, using KU-60019, an ATM kinase inhibitor, we investigated ATM inhibition as a synthetically lethal strategy to target breast cancer cells with PTEN defects. We found that KU-60019 preferentially sensitizes PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 breastcancer cells to cisplatin, though it also slightly enhances sensitivity of PTENwild-type breast cancer cells. The increased cytotoxic sensitivity is associated with apoptosis, as evidenced by flow cytometry and PARP cleavage. Additionally,the increase of DNA damage accumulation due to the decreased capability of DNArepair, as indicated by γ-H2AX and Rad51 foci, also contributed to this selectivecytotoxicity. Mechanistically, compared with PTEN wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells,PTEN-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells have lower level of Rad51, higher ATM kinaseactivity, and display the elevated level of DNA damage. Moreover, thesedifferences could be further enlarged by cisplatin. Our findings suggest that ATMis a promising target for PTEN-defective breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
