It is stillunclear, however, what information should be considered for optimal diseasestratification, and most prior work focuses on tumor genomics. Here, we focus on the tumor microenvironment. Using a large-scale coculture assay optimized tomeasure drug-induced cell death, we identify tumor-stroma interactions thatmodulate drug sensitivity. Our data show that the chemo-insensitivity typicallyassociated with aggressive subtypes of breast cancer is not observed if thesecells are grown in 2D or 3D monoculture, but is manifested when these cells arecocultured with stromal cells, such as fibroblasts. Furthermore, we find thatfibroblasts influence drug responses in two distinct and divergent manners,associated with the tissue from which the fibroblasts were harvested. Thesedivergent phenotypes occur regardless of the drug tested and result frommodulation of apoptotic priming within tumor cells. Our study highlightsunexpected diversity in tumor-stroma interactions, and we reveal new principlesthat dictate how fibroblasts alter tumor drug responses.Â© 2018 The Authors.
