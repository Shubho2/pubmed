The FNA biopsy is frequently the first diagnostic choice indetermining the primary site of the tumor. Estrogen receptor (ER) positivity indiagnostic tissue is generally used to favor breast over lung primary. However,the recent studies have shown a wide range of ER antibody cross reactivity withlung adenocarcinoma. We studied the frequency of ER expression in cytologysamples of lung adenocarcinoma using antibodies to three different ER clones.METHODS: Cytology cell block preparations, including 22 lung FNAs and 19malignant pleural effusions (PE) from 41 patients, with clinically documentedprimary lung adenocarcinomas were selected for this study. All cases were stainedwith monoclonal antibodies to ER clones 6F11 and 1D5. Twenty nine cases withremaining available material (15 FNA and 14 PE) were stained with a thirdantibody to ER clone SP1. The extent of ER nuclear staining was scored as 3+(50%-100% of tumor cells), 2+ (11%-49%), and 1+ (≤10%).RESULTS: Positivity for ER-6F11 clone was present in 4 of 22 lung FNAs (18.2%, 2+staining). Two of the four 6F11 positive FNAs also co-expressed ER-1D5 (9.1%, 2+ staining). No immunoreactivity was observed for ER clones 6F11 and 1D5 in all 19 malignant PEs. In addition, none of the remaining 15 FNAs and 14 PEs showedimmunoreactivity for ER-SP1 clone.CONCLUSIONS: A small subset of pulmonary adenocarcinomas shows immunoreactivityfor ER clones 6F11 and 1D5 in FNA samples (18.2% and 9.1%, respectively). Theabsence of immunoreactivity for ER-SP1 clone indicates higher specificity of thisclone in non-breast tissue. The differential diagnostic value of all ER clones inmalignant PEs appears to be secure. Larger studies are necessary to validate thisobservation.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/dc.23910 PMID: 29465823
