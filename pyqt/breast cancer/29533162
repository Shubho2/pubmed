The main aim of thepresent study was to explore whether social support and fear of receivingcompassion from others are predictors of depression symptoms in a sample ofbreast cancer patients.METHODS: The sample included 86 female patients with non-metastatic breastcancer. Participants were recruited at a Radiotherapy Service in central Portugaland completed validated self-report instruments. Multiple regression analysiswere conducted to examine the predictive effects of clinical (cancer stage,comorbidities) and demographic variables (age, education), social support, andfear of receiving compassion from others on depressive symptoms.RESULTS: Fear of receiving compassion from others was the only significantpredictor of the model, with a positive effect on depression symptomatology (β = 0.44; p < 0.001). These results suggest that the amount of supportive socialcontacts and networks may not be as important as cancer patients' ability toreceive compassion from others.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to focus on fear of receiving compassionfrom others in cancer patients and seems to be a significant contribution for thestudy of the social factors that may be associated with depression in breastcancer. Psychological screening interviews in breast cancer, besides assessingpatients' level of depression and social support, ought to also evaluate theability to receive empathy and emotional help and support from other people.DOI: 10.1080/07347332.2018.1440275 PMID: 29533162
