Microbial sequences in plasma cfDNA mayprovide important information to improve prognosis and treatment. We havedeveloped a stringent method to identify microbial species via microbial cfDNA inthe blood plasma of early-onset breast cancer (EOBC) patients and healthyfemales. Empirically, microbe-originated sequence reads were identified bymapping non-human PE reads in cfDNA libraries to microbial databases. Thosemapped concordantly to unique microbial species were assembled into contigs,which were subsequently aligned to the same databases. Microbial species uniquelyaligned were identified and compared across all individuals on MCRPM (MicrobialCfDNA Reads Per Million quality PE reads) basis.RESULTS: The predominant microbial cfDNAs in all plasma samples examined areoriginated from bacteria and these bacteria were limited to only a few genera.Among those, Acinetobacter johnsonii XBB1 and low levels of Mycobacterium spp.were commonly found in all healthy females, but also present in an EOBC patient. Compared to those in healthy counterparts, bacterial species in EOBC patients aremore diverse and more likely to present at high levels. Among these three EOBCpatients tested, a patient who has record high titer (2,724 MCRPM) of Pseudomonasmendocina together with 8.82 MCRPM of Pannonibacter phragmitetus has passed away;another patient infected by multiple Sphingomonas species remains alive; whilethe third patient who has similar microbial species (Acinetobacter johnsoniiXBB1) commonly seen in normal controls is having a normal life.CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data on the profiles of microbial cfDNA sequencessuggested that it may have some prognostic value in cancer patients. Validationin larger number of patients is warranted.DOI: 10.1186/s12920-018-0329-y PMCID: PMC5836824PMID: 29504912
