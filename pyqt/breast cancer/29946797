Women with post-menopausal HR+/HER2- mBC who initiatedfirst-line therapy for mBC were selected and classified under three cohorts,based on treatment received: cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor(i.e., palbociclib-the only CDK4/6 approved at the time of the study), endocrine therapy (ET), and chemotherapy. Frequency of monitoring [complete blood count(CBC), electrocardiogram (EKG), and liver function test (LFT)] and laboratoryabnormalities detected during the first line of therapy were analyzed.RESULTS: In the chart review analysis, 64 US oncologists abstracted medicalinformation on 401 eligible patients, including 210 CDK4/6 users, 121 ET users,51 chemotherapy users; 19 patients used other regimens. All patients had ≥ 1 CBC;between 8.3% (ET users) and 39.5% (CDK4/6 users) had ≥ 1 EKG; and over 98% ofpatients had ≥ 1 LFT across all three cohorts. Among monitored patients, 64.6%had a CBC abnormality, with anemia (39.9%), leukopenia (27.4%), and neutropenia(26.7%) being the most common. Abnormal EKG readings were detected in 8.4, 0.0%, and 7.7% of CDK4/6, ET, and chemotherapy users, respectively. LFT abnormalitieswere detected in 14.1-26.0% of CDK4/6 and chemotherapy users, respectively.Similar frequency of monitoring was observed in the claims analysis, with theexception of EKG monitoring, for which the proportion of patients tested washigher.CONCLUSION: Post-menopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC receiving first-line therapywith CDK4/6, ET, or chemotherapy were regularly monitored regardless of thefirst-line regimen received.FUNDING: Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.DOI: 10.1007/s12325-018-0740-y PMID: 29946797
