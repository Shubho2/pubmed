Electronic address: Ljacob14@jhmi.edu.Ductal carcinoma in situ has been stable in incidence for a decade and has anexcellent prognosis. Breast conservation therapy is safe and effective for mostpatients. Adjuvant whole breast radiation therapy is recommended to reduce therisk of local recurrence. Accelerated partial breast irradiation is a promisingalternative to decrease toxicity and improve cosmetic results. Adjuvant hormonal therapy can reduce local recurrence, but should be used cautiously. Futuredirections in management include developing predictive tools for guidance for useof adjuvant therapy and selecting low-risk patients with ductal carcinoma in situin whom surgery may be safely omitted.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
