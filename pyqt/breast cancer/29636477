Here, we determine that somatic mutations in PIK3CA (44%), PIK3R1 (17%), AKT3 (15%), and PTEN (12%) are prevalent anddiverse in Chinese breast cancer patients, with 60 novel mutations identified. A high proportion of tumors harbors multiple mutations, especially PIK3CA plusPIK3R1 mutations (9.0%). Next, we develop a recombination-based mutationbarcoding (ReMB) library for impactful mutations conferring clonal advantage inproliferation and drug responses. The highest-ranking PIK3CA and PIK3R1 mutationsinclude previously reported deleterious mutations, as well as mutations withunknown significance. These PIK3CA and PIK3R1 impactful mutations exhibit amutually exclusive pattern, leading to oncogenesis and hyperactivity of PI3Kpathway. The PIK3CA impactful mutations are tightly associated with hormonereceptor positivity. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding ofPI3K impactful mutations in breast cancer and have important implications forPI3K-targeted therapy in precision oncology.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03867-9 PMCID: PMC5893593PMID: 29636477
