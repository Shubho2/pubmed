For those who cannot takehormone therapy, autologous platelet-rich plasma combined with hyaluronic acid(A-PRP-HA) may provide a new alternative therapy for the treatment of VVA inpostmenopausal women with history of breast cancer.METHODS: We enrolled 20 postmenopausal breast cancers survivors with VVA and ascore of <15 on the Gloria Bachman Vaginal Health Index (VHI) comprised of fiveitems including: vaginal pH, elasticity, fluid volume (secretions), epithelialintegrity, and moisture.We administered intramucosal injections of A-PRP combinedwith HA (Regenkit) and performed clinical evaluations at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months.Primary endpoint: evaluation of vulvovaginal mucosa changes using the VHI;secondary endpoint: evaluation of dyspareunia and sexual dysfunction based on theFemale Sexual Distress (FSD) score.RESULTS: All participants (20 women) showed improvement in the clinical symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. The VHI score showed a significant increaseat 6 months, going from a total baseline score (pretreatment) of 10.7 ± 2.12 to20.75 ± 4.8 (P < 0.0001) at 6 months. Improvement in hydration and vaginalepithelial integrity was reported. A VHI score of > 15 showed a successfultreatment outcome. The FSD score decreased significantly during the study, from abaseline score of 36.35 ± 2.53 pretreatment to 30.15 ± 2.47 6 months aftertreatment, representing improvement of 17% (P < 0.0001, respectively). No adverseevents were reported.CONCLUSIONS: The injection of A-PRP-HA appeared to be a promising method toimprove the trophicity and hydration of vaginal mucosa for the treatment of VVAin postmenopausal breast cancer survivors with contraindications to hormonetherapy.DOI: 10.1097/GME.0000000000001122 PMID: 29738415
