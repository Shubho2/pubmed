SPC risk in POFT survivors (SIR, 1.29) was highercompared to the general population. The most high-risk type of SPC was leukaemia (3.07) followed by the lung and bronchus (1.80), colon (1.58), rectum andrectosigmoid junction (1.42), thyroid (1.34), and breast (1.26). In women aged< 60 years, cancer of the breast (1.30), ascending colon (2.26), and transversecolon (4.07) as SPCs increased. Up to 10 years after POFT cancer treatment,leukaemia risk increased, especially in those < 60 years, with serous histology, and with distant stage, which required aggressive chemotherapy. The medianoverall survival time was 12.8 years and 14.3 years in women with POFT cancer andSPCs, respectively. Thyroid and breast cancers were favourable prognostic markersamong SPCs.CONCLUSIONS: The overall SPC risk increases in POFT cancer survivors, especially in those < 60 years. The cancer risk of breast and the proximal colon increasebased on hereditary predisposition, while leukaemia likely develops fromaggressive treatment. The median overall survival is favourable in POFT cancersurvivors with SPCs.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4700-3 PMID: 30089478
