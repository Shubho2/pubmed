[Epub ahead ofprint]Artifacts in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis.Geiser WR(1), Einstein SA(1), Yang WT(2).Author information: (1)1 Department of Imaging Physics, The University of Texas MD Anderson CancerCenter, 1155 Pressler St, Unit 1352, Houston, TX 77030.(2)2 Department of Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Texas MD AndersonCancer Center, Houston, TX.OBJECTIVE: Artifacts in digital breast tomosynthesis and synthesized 2D imagingreduce image quality. This article describes the appearance of these uniqueartifacts, reviews their causes, and discusses methods to ameliorate theseartifacts.CONCLUSION: Artifacts in digital breast tomosynthesis and synthesized 2D imaging can obscure important findings on mammograms. The radiologist, mammographytechnologist, and medical physicist must be able to recognize these artifacts anduse the vendor's new processing algorithms to mitigate the effects of suchartifacts.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.19271 PMID: 30063382
