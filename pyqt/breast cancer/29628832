The injury of the intercostobrachial nerve is considered the majorcause of this type of pain.Purpose: Evaluation of efficacy and safety of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) andsteroid injection on the 2nd and 3rd thoracic (T2 and T3) dorsal root ganglions(DRGs) for intercostobrachial neuralgia (ICBN) postmastectomy.Patients and Methods: This study was conducted on 100 patients with ICBNpostmastectomy. The PRF waves were applied for 120 s twice on T2 and T3 DRGs then1 ml of 4 mg dexamethasone and 1 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% were injected at eachlevel then the technique was repeated three times 1 week apart for each patient.Results: After 6 months from the latest intervention, the mean of visual analogscale dropped from 7.48 to 4.7 (P = 0.005712) and the mean of the quality of lifescale improved to 6.88 after being 4.66 (P < 0.00001) before the intervention and64.68% of the patients decided that they would certainly repeat the procedure if they could go back in time and 66.64% would certainly recommend the sameprocedure to a family member. The analgesics consumption decreased mainly in the 1st month but increased again after 6 months (not significant). No seriouscomplications were recorded.Conclusions: PRF and steroid injection on T2 and T3 DRGs assumed an effective andsafe method for ICBN postmastectomy treatment.DOI: 10.4103/sja.SJA_576_17 PMCID: PMC5875210PMID: 29628832
