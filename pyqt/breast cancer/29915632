Theincidence, causes and outcomes of unplanned reoperation were examined and therisk factors were identified using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results: In total, 24 patients (1.2%) underwent unplanned reoperations because ofearly complications after radical gastrectomy. The main causes more frequentlyrequiring reoperation were adhesive intestinal obstruction (eight cases, 33.3%), intra-abdominal bleeding (five cases, 20.8%), wound dehiscence (five cases,20.8%), anastomotic leakage and intra-abdominal infection (five cases, 20.8%),and iatrogenic common bile duct injury (one case). Multivariate analysisidentified that only combined multi-organ resection (odds ratio (OR) = 4.060, 95%confidence interval (CI): 1.645 - 10.023, P = 0.002) was an independent riskfactor. Two patients (8.3%) who underwent reoperation died from disseminatedintravascular coagulation or sepsis, respectively, which was significantly higherthan the remaining 1,924 patients who did not require reoperation (six cases,0.3%, P < 0.001). Moreover, patients who underwent reoperation experienced highermorbidity rates (37.5% vs. 6.8%, P < 0.001), requiring intensive care (20.8% vs. 2.4%, P < 0.001) and longer postoperative hospital stays (33.6 days vs. 11.0days, P < 0.001) compared with patients required no reoperation.Conclusions: Combined multi-organ resection was an independent risk factor forunplanned reoperation following radical gastrectomy. Avoiding multi-organresection as possible will decrease the likelihood of patients requiringreoperation.DOI: 10.14740/gr1032w PMCID: PMC5997474PMID: 29915632
