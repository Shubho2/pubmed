Many researchershave sought to develop a system to quantitate residual tumor and its correlation with prognosis after PST. This retrospective study validated the CPS + EG stagingsystem and Neo-Bioscore in a single center in China.METHODS: Data from patients with non-metastatic primary breast cancer who weretreated with PST and surgery from Jan. 2008 to Dec. 2014 at the Breast DiseaseCenter of Peking University First Hospital, China, were reviewed. DFS, DSS and OSwere calculated using the K-M curve and AUC. Multivariate analysis was used for aCox proportional hazards model. All calculations were performed with SAS 9.4.RESULTS: A total of 403 patients were enrolled in this study. The medianfollow-up period was 45 (range 11-107) months. The five-year DFS, DSS and OSrates were 86.4%, 91.2% and 90.5%, respectively. The CS, PS, CPS + EG stagingsystem and Neo-Bioscore stratified patients according to DFS, DSS, and OS afterPST, with all P values < 0.0001. The CPS + EG staging system and Neo-Bioscorestratified prognosis after PST better than CS. HER2-positive patients withouttrastuzumab treatment had obviously worse DFS and OS than other subgroups withdifferent HER2 statuses that scored a 3 in the Neo-Bioscore system.CONCLUSIONS: The CPS + EG staging system and Neo-Bioscore can improve prognostic prediction in non-pCR breast cancer patients after PST and, provided unfavorable prognostic factors such as insufficient treatment are incorporated, will havebroader clinical applicability.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
