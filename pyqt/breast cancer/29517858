In subsequent studies,EML4-ALK has been detected in a low percentage of patients, and was associatedwith a lack of EGFR or KRAS mutations, younger age, and adenocarcinoma withacinar histology. Cases with the EML4-ALK fusion gene were examined to clarifythe clinicopathological characteristics of young adenocarcinoma patients.METHODS: Between December 1998 and May 2009, 85 patients aged ≤ 50 with lungadenocarcinoma were treated at our hospital. We examined 49 samples fromadenocarcinoma patients who underwent surgical resection, chemotherapy, and/orradiotherapy for the EML4-ALK gene. None of the patients received ALK inhibitors because these drugs had not been approved in Japan before 2012. EML4-ALK fusiongenes were screened using multiplex reverse-transcription PCR assay, and wereconfirmed by direct sequencing.RESULTS: The EML4-ALK fusion gene was detected in five tumors (10.2%). Onepatient had stage IB disease, one had stage IIIA, and three had stage IV.Histologically, there was one solid adenocarcinoma, two acinar adenocarcinomas,and two papillary adenocarcinomas. EML4-ALK fusion genes were mutually exclusive to EGFR and KRAS mutations. The five-year survival rate was 59.4% in patientswithout EML4-ALK fusion and was not reached in patients with EML4-ALK fusion.CONCLUSION: The EML4-ALK fusion gene may be a strong oncogene in younger patientswith lung adenocarcinoma.© 2018 The Authors.
