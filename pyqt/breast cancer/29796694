The re-RT schedules were 45 Gy (1.8 Gy per fraction) administered either to the partial breast (n = 42) ormastectomy scar (n = 41). The patients and tumor characteristics predictive oflocal control, distant control, and survival (overall and breast-cancer specific)were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.RESULTS: The median follow-up was 35 months (range 3-143 months). The median timeinterval between the first irradiation and re-RT was 117 months (range16-357 months). The prognostic factors for favorable overall survival rates were younger age (p = 0.045), lower T‑category (p = 0.019), and N0 category(p = 0.005). N0 was also superior to N+ with respect to outfield recurrences(p = <0.001) and breast cancer-specific survival (p = 0.025). Acute and late skintoxicity was generally low (<grade 3).CONCLUSION: Re-RT with 45 Gy (1.8 Gy per fraction) for partial breast ormastectomy scar after the second surgery resulted in high local control rates andtolerable skin toxicity.DOI: 10.1007/s00066-018-1315-1 PMID: 29796694
