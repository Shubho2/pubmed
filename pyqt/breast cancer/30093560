[Epub ahead of print]Cancer-associated MORC2 mutant M276I regulates an hnRNPM-mediated CD44 splicingswitch to promote invasion and metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer.Zhang FL(1), Cao JL(2), Xie HY(3), Sun R(4), Yang LF(2), Shao ZM(5), Li DQ(6).Author information: (1)Cancer Institute, Fudan University.(2)Fudan University.(3)Shanghai Cancer Center and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, FudanUniversity.(4)Institutes of biomedical sciences, Fudan University.(5)Department of Breast Surgery, Breast Cancer Institution, Cancer Hospital,FudanUniversity.(6)Cancer Institute and Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan Universitydaqiangli1974@fudan.edu.cn.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal subtype of breast cancer,with a high propensity for distant metastasis and limited treatment options, yet its molecular underpinnings remain largely unknown. Microrchidia family CW-typezinc finger 2 (MORC2) is a newly identified chromatin remodeling protein whosemutations have been causally implicated in several neurological disorders. Herewe report that a cancer-associated substitution of methionine to isoleucine atresidue 276 (M276I) of MORC2 confers gain-of-function properties in themetastatic progression of TNBC. Expression of mutant MORC2 in TNBC cellsincreased cell migration, invasion, and lung metastasis without affecting cellproliferation and primary tumor growth compared with its wild-type counterpart.The M276I mutation enhanced binding of MORC2 to heterogeneous nuclearribonucleoprotein M (hnRNPM), a component of the spliceosome machinery. Thisinteraction promoted an hnRNPM-mediated splicing switch of CD44 from theepithelial isoform (CD44v) to the mesenchymal isoform (CD44s), ultimately drivingepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Knockdown of hnRNPM reduced the binding of mutant MORC2 to CD44 pre-mRNA and reversed the mutant MORC2-induced CD44splicing switch and EMT, consequently impairing the migratory, invasive, and lungmetastatic potential of mutant MORC2-expressing cells. Collectively, thesefindings provide the first functional evidence for the M276I mutation inpromoting TNBC progression. They also establish the first mechanistic connection between MORC2 and RNA splicing and highlight the importance of deciphering uniquepatient-derived mutations for optimizing clinical outcomes of this highlyheterogeneous disease.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-1394 PMID: 30093560
