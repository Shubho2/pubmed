China.Breast cancer greatly threatens the health of women all over the word despite of several effective drugs. Targeted therapy for breast cancer is limited to humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Herceptin®, monoclonal antibodyagainst HER2, is now widely used in HER2(+) breast cancer. Abraxane®, the currentgold standard for paclitaxel (PTX) delivery, has shown superiority in breastcancer based on nanoparticle albumin bound technology. Despite these advances,further novel targeted therapy with more improved anti-tumor efficacy for breast cancer is still urgently needed. Here, we report the recombinant nanocomposites(NPs) composed of the above two clinical drugs of Abraxane® and Herceptin®(Abra/anti-HER2), which at first migrates to the tumor region through the unique targeting mechanism of human serum albumin (HSA) of Abraxane®, and sequentiallyfurther precisely recognize the HER2(+) breast cancer cells due to Herceptin®.The Abra/anti-HER2 NPs were fabricated by a "one-step" synthesis using EDC/NHS.In vitro analysis of cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle revealed thatAbra/anti-HER2 NPs showed more anti-tumor efficacy against HER2(+) SK-BR-3 cells than Abraxane® at equivalent PTX concentration. In addition, in HER2(+) breastcancer xenograft model, Abra/anti-HER2 NPs significantly inhibited tumor growthwith less side effects. Moreover, the properties of more precise target anddelayed release of PTX were proved by NIRF imaging. Thus, our results indicatethat Abra/anti-HER2 NPs could represent a next-generation sequentiallydual-targeting therapeutic agent for HER2(+) breast cancer.DOI: 10.7150/jca.22163 PMCID: PMC5820917PMID: 29483955
