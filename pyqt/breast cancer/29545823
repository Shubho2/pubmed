We conducted a genome-wide association study ofserum 25(OH)D (assessed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) and386,449 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our sample consisted of 1,829participants randomly selected from the Sister Study, a cohort of women who had asister with breast cancer but had never had breast cancer themselves. 19,741 SNPswere associated with 25(OH)D (p < 0.05). We re-assessed these hits in anindependent sample of 1,534 participants who later developed breast cancer. Afterpooling, 32 SNPs had genome-wide significant associations (p < 5 × 10-8). Thesewere located in or near GC, the vitamin D binding protein, or CYP2R1, acytochrome P450 enzyme that hydroxylates vitamin D to form 25(OH)D. The top hitwas rs4588, a missense GC polymorphism associated with a 3.5 ng/mL decrease in25(OH)D per copy of the minor allele (95% confidence interval [CI]: -4.1, -3.0; p= 4.5 × 10-38). The strongest SNP near CYP2R1 was rs12794714, a synonymousvariant (p = 3.8 × 10-12; β = 1.8 ng/mL decrease in 25(OH)D per minor allele [CI:-2.2, -1.3]). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations from samples collected from someparticipants 3-10 years after baseline (811 cases, 780 non-cases) were alsostrongly associated with both loci. These findings augment our understanding ofgenetic influences on 25(OH)D and the possible role of vitamin D binding proteinsand cytochrome P450 enzymes in determining measured levels. These results mayhelp to identify individuals genetically predisposed to vitamin D insufficiency.DOI: 10.3389/fgene.2018.00067 PMCID: PMC5838824PMID: 29545823
