Electronic address:kagaran@onsurg.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.(3)Department of Pathology, Osaka University, Graduate School of Medicine, Suita City, Japan.The pathologic feature of intraductal papillomas is defined as a papillarystructure composed of a fibrovascular stromal core lined by luminal epithelialcells and myoepithelial cells. We used droplet digital PCR for the mutationalanalysis of AKT1 (E17K) and PIK3CA (H1047R, E542K, and E545K) in 60 papillomas.AKT1 and PIK3CA mutations were detected in 12 (20%) and 17 (28%) of thepapillomas, respectively. In five tumors harboring mutations, mutational analysisof AKT1 or PIK3CA was performed separately using luminal epithelial cells andmyoepithelial cells sorted using anti-cytokeratin 19 antibody and anti-α smoothmuscle actin antibody. The two types of cells from a given papilloma had theidentical mutation. Three patients with the PIK3CA mutation-positive papillomadeveloped breast cancers at the resection site of the papilloma, but none ofthese subsequent breast cancers had the PIK3CA mutation. These results indicatethat a papilloma stems from a bipotent progenitor cell that contains the AKT1 or PIK3CA mutation and proliferates and differentiates to form the papilloma.Papilloma can be a risk factor for developing breast cancer but is unlikely to beits obligate precursor.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.
