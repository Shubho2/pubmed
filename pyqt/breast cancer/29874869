Understanding the factors that contribute to the progression and metastasis of breast cancer can revealtherapeutic opportunities. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family ofproteolytic enzymes whose role in cancer has been widely documented. They arecapable of contributing to every step of the metastatic cascade, but enthusiasmfor the use of MMP inhibition as a therapeutic approach has been dampened by the disappointing results of clinical trials conducted more than 20 years ago. Since the trials, our knowledge of MMP biology has expanded greatly. Combined withadvances in the selective targeting of individual MMPs and the specific delivery of therapeutics to the tumor microenvironment, we may be on the verge of finally realizing the promise of MMP inhibition as a treatment strategy. Here, as a case in point, we focus specifically on MMP-2 as an example to show how it cancontribute to each stage of breast-cancer-to-bone metastasis and also discussnovel approaches for the selective targeting of MMP-2 in the setting of thebone-cancer microenvironment.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10060185 PMCID: PMC6025260PMID: 29874869
