Our previous study showed that overexpression of NCS-1increased the efficacy of paclitaxel in vitro, but was associated with poorclinical outcome. Here, we determine if NCS-1 expression is associated withpathological complete response (pCR) to taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 105 pre-treatment breast cancer biopsies. Elevated expression of NCS-1 was found to be positively associated with pCR. These results suggest that NCS-1 may be apredictive biomarker for response to taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy inbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0057-7 PMCID: PMC5847580PMID: 29560416
