We used genetic data as analternative approach to investigate shared biological etiology of these twodiseases. Genetic correlation analysis of summary level statistics fromgenomewide association studies (GWAS) using LD Score regression revealed moderatebut significant genetic correlation (rg  = 0.23, P = 9.3 × 10-3 ), and SNP effectconcordance analysis provided evidence for significant SNP pleiotropy(P = 6.0 × 10-3 ) and concordance in effect direction (P = 2.0 × 10-3 ) betweenthe two diseases. Cross-disease GWAS meta-analysis highlighted 13 distinct lociassociated at P ≤ 10-5 with both endometriosis and endometrial cancer, with onelocus (SNP rs2475335) located within PTPRD associated at a genomewide significantlevel (P = 4.9 × 10-8 , OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.07-1.15). PTPRD acts in the STAT3pathway, which has been implicated in both endometriosis and endometrial cancer. This study demonstrates the value of cross-disease genetic analysis to supportepidemiological observations and to identify biological pathways of relevance to multiple diseases.© 2018 The Authors.
