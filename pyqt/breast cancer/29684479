Electronic address:Georgios.Scheiner-Bobis@vetmed.uni-giessen.de.Although dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) constitutes the most abundantsteroid in humans, in-depth investigations of its effects are rather scarce. Weaddress here DHEAS effects on the estrogen receptor-positive metastatic humanbreast cancer cell line MCF-7. We focus on DHEAS-mediated signaling that mightinfluence expression of claudin-1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), bothknown to be critical factors for migration and invasiveness of various cancers,including breast cancer cells. Physiological concentrations of DHEAS triggerpersistent phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in MCF-7 cells. Exposure of these cells for 24 h to 1 μM DHEAS also leads to a significant reduction of claudin-1 expression that cannot be prevented by high concentrations of the steroid sulfataseinhibitor STX64, indicating that desulfation and further conversion of DHEAS tosome other steroid hormone is not required for this action. In addition, exposureof MCF-7 cells to the same concentration of DHEAS completely abolishes MMP-9expression and considerably impairs cell migratory behavior. Abrogation of Gnα11 expression by siRNA prevents the stimulatory effect of DHEAS on Erk1/2phosphorylation, consistent with a G-protein-coupled receptor being involved inthe DHEAS-induced signaling. Nevertheless, Gnα11 also has direct effects that do not depend on DHEAS; thus, when Gnα11 expression is suppressed, expression ofclaudin-1 and MMP-9 as well as cell migration are significantly reduced. This is the first report demonstrating direct involvement of DHEAS and Gnα11 in theregulation of claudin-1 and MMP-9 expression and migration of MCF-7 cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
