Hence, potentialinteractions of chemotherapy with L-thyroxine, possibly contributing to fatigue, would be of high clinical relevance. Therefore, we investigated fatigue andunderlying pathways in L-thyroxine-using breast cancer patients duringchemotherapy.METHODS: Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), L-triiodothyronine (T3), and diurnal salivary cortisol patterns were analyzed in breast cancer patients in thebeginning and at the end of adjuvant chemotherapy within the control group(n = 41) of a randomized exercise intervention trial. Additionally, relationshipsin the exercising group (n = 45) as well as in healthy women (n = 25) wereexplored. Regression and mediation analyses were performed.RESULTS: L-Thyroxine use was significantly associated with lower TSH(median = 0.33 mU/l, interquartile range = (0.15-0.48)), whereas patients notusing L-thyroxine had TSH comparable to healthy women (0.51 mU/l (0.37-0.74)). T3significantly declined during chemotherapy in L-thyroxine users but not innon-users. However, the group difference failed statistical significance.L-Thyroxine treatment was significantly associated with increased physicalfatigue during chemotherapy (p = 0.004) in the non-exercising group. Thisassociation appeared to be partly mediated by TSH. Further, TSH appeared toaffect fatigue partly via increased cortisol levels. In the exercise group, therewas no significant association between L-thyroxine and fatigue.CONCLUSIONS: L-Thyroxine treatment during chemotherapy might result in hormonaldysregulations that can contribute to increased physical fatigue. Therefore,breast cancer patients on L-thyroxine treatment may need special monitoring oftheir thyroid levels and of fatigue during chemotherapy and should be encouraged to exercise.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01106820.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4095-3 PMID: 29445858
