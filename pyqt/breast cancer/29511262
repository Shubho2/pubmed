Our study is the first investigationaiming to determine the predictive value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio onprognosis of patients with stage III melanoma. This retrospective study utilized a cohort of 107 patients with stage III melanoma treated at Huntsman CancerInstitute, University of Utah, from May 2002 to March 2016. The optimal cutoff ofneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was determined by the significance of log-ranktests. A total of 97 log-rank tests were conducted to find the optimal cutoff.Disease free survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariableand multivariable Cox models were applied to evaluate the predictive value ofneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. 2.5 was identified as the optimal cutoff.Kaplan-Meier curve showed that the disease free survival rate of the low valuegroup was significantly higher compared to that of high value group. Afteradjusting for confounders and other prognostic factors, theneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio â‰¥ 2.5 remained a strong predictor for diseaserecurrence in patients with stage III melanoma.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22425-3 PMCID: PMC5840418PMID: 29511262
