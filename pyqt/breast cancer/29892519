Bone-targeted agents (BTAs), likezoledronic acid and denosumab, reduce the incidence of SREs and delay progressionof bone pain.Materials and methods: We evaluated the management of BMs and pain in sixEuropean countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK) using theAdelphi Breast Cancer Disease Specific Programme, which included a physiciansurvey and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to assess the impact of BMs on painand QoL.Results: 301 physicians completed patient record forms for 2984 patients withadvanced breast cancer; 1408 with BMs and 1136 with metastases at sites otherthan bone (non-BMs). Most patients with BMs (88%) received a BTA, with 81%receiving treatment during 3 months following BM diagnosis. For those who did notreceive a BTA, the main reasons given were: very recent BM diagnosis, perceivedlow risk of bone complications, and short life expectancy. Most patients with BMs(68%) were experiencing bone pain and, of these, 97% were taking analgesics(including 28% receiving strong opioids). Despite this, moderate to severe painwas reported in 20% of patients who were experiencing pain. PROs were assessed in766 patients with advanced breast cancer (392 with BMs, 374 with non-BMs).Overall, patients with BMs reported worse pain and QoL outcomes than those withnon-BMs, those not receiving a BTA reported worse pain.Conclusion: Despite the large proportion of patients receiving BTAs in thisstudy, some patients with BMs are still not receiving early treatment to prevent SREs or to manage pain. Improving physicians' understanding of the role of BTAsand the importance of early treatment following BM diagnosis has the potential toimprove patient care.DOI: 10.1016/j.jbo.2017.11.004 PMCID: PMC5993954PMID: 29892519
