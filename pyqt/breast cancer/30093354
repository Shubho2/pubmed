The objective of this study was to evaluate RSvalidity in a group of older women with ER-positive breast cancer.METHODS: Utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER)database with available RS, we evaluated women with ER-positive breast canceraged 18-69 and those 70 years of age and older from 2004 to 2014. We utilizedmultivariable logistic regression models to evaluate factors associated with RStesting as well as a high-risk categorization for those who underwent testing.Survival was analyzed using Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazardmodels.RESULTS: We identified 363,876 women aged 18-69 years and 147,107 women aged70 years and older. A smaller proportion of patients in the older group (8%)underwent RS testing than in the younger group (18%). Of the patients whounderwent testing, distribution of RS was similar between groups. High-riskcategorization independently predicted a higher likelihood of death for olderpatients (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.15-1.90). Among patientswith high-risk RS, chemotherapy was associated with a decreased risk of death in the younger group, but not in the older group.CONCLUSION: Older women are less likely to receive RS testing, but when tested,older patients have a similar distribution of RS as compared to younger patients.While high-risk categorization in the older cohort was prognostic, chemotherapywas not associated with improved survival.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
