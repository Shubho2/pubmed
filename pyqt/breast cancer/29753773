Electronic address:karpoormath@ukzn.ac.za.A novel series of 4,6-disubstituted pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines (7-43) bearingvarious anilines at C-4 position and thiophenethyl or thiopentane moieties at C-6position have been designed and synthesized by molecular hybridization approach. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for in vitro CDK2/cyclin E and Ablkinase inhibitory activity as well as anti-proliferative activity against K-562(chronic myelogeneous leukemia), and MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) cell lines.The structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed that compounds withthiophenethyl group at C-6 with mono-substituted anilines at C-4 exhibited betterCDK2 inhibitory activity compared to alkyl group (thiopentane) at C-6 anddi-substituted anilines at C-4 of the scaffold. In particular, compounds having2-chloro, 3-nitro and 4-methylthio aniline groups at C-4 displayed significantenzymatic inhibitory activity against CDK2 with single digit micromolar IC50values. The in silico molecular docking studies suggested possible bindingorientation and the binding energies were in agreement with the observed SAR aswell as experimental results. In addition, some of the synthesized compoundsshowed anti-proliferative effects against K-562 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines with IC50 values in a micromolar range. Thus, the synthesized compounds could beconsidered as new anticancer hits for further lead optimization.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
