With several options available in the metastaticsetting for hormone positive breast cancer, these patients require anindividualized approach to decision-making that considers multiple factors beyondperformance status and chronologic age. Areas covered: The authors review theliterature on endocrine monotherapy and combinations for hormone positivemetastatic breast cancer, with specific commentary on the efficacy and toxicityfor elderly patients. The authors describe the role of comprehensive geriatricassessment (CGA) and highlight the considerations for the use of bone modifyingagents, and HER2-targeted therapy for hormone positive/HER2+ patients. Expertopinion: Evidence for elderly patients is largely based on subgroup analyses,which should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, elderly patients withmetastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer appear to derive similarbenefit from treatments as younger patients. Similarly, for most drugs, thesepatients have no significant worsening of toxicity compared to younger patients. In addition to tumor biology, patient values and information from the CGA should be used to guide treatment decisions.DOI: 10.1080/14656566.2018.1454431 PMID: 29601247  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
