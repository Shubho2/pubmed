[Epub aheadof print]Nanogel-mediated delivery of a cocktail of epigenetic drugs plus doxorubicinovercomes drug resistance in breast cancer cells.Vijayaraghavalu S(1), Labhasetwar V(2)(3).Author information: (1)Department of Biomedical Engineering, Lerner Research Institute, ClevelandClinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.(2)Department of Biomedical Engineering, Lerner Research Institute, ClevelandClinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA. labhasv@ccf.org.(3)Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.labhasv@ccf.org.Epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA methylation or histone deacetylation) arecommonly implicated in cancer chemoresistance. We previously showed thatpretreating resistant MCF-7/ADR breast cancer cells with a demethylating agent(5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC)) or with an inhibitor of histone deacetylase(suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)) sensitized resistant cells todoxorubicin (DOX) treatment. However, even with increasing doses of DOX, afraction of resistant cells remained nonresponsive to this pretreatment (~ 25%pretreated with DAC, ~ 45% with SAHA). We hypothesized that pretreating resistantcells with a combination of epigenetic drugs (DAC + SAHA) could more effectively overcome drug resistance. We postulated that delivery of epigenetic drugsencapsulated in biodegradable nanogels (NGs) would further enhance theirefficacy. MCF-7/ADR cells were first treated with a single drug vs. a combinationof epigenetic drugs, either as solutions or encapsulated in NGs, then subjectedto DOX, either in solution or in NGs. Antiproliferative data showed thatpretreatment with epigenetic drugs in NGs, then with DOX in NGs, was mosteffective in overcoming resistance; this treatment inhibited cell growth by> 90%, even at low doses of DOX. Cell cycle analysis showed that a major fractionof cells treated with a cocktail of epigenetic drugs + DOX, all in NGformulations, remained in the G2/M cell cycle arrest phase for a prolongedperiod. The mechanism of better efficacy of epigenetic drugs in NGs could beattributed to their sustained effect. A similar strategy could be developed forother cancer cells in which drug resistance is due to epigenetic modifications.DOI: 10.1007/s13346-018-0556-y PMID: 29947019
