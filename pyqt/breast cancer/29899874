Tumors overexpressingHER2 protein are more aggressive and metastatic; hence, patients have a poorprognosis. Anti-HER2 strategies, such as the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab(Tz), have therefore been developed. Despite this progress, not all patientsrespond to the treatment. Retinoic acid (RA) has been proposed as an adjuvanttreatment of breast carcinoma because of its ability to inhibit cell growth. Weevaluated the effect of Tz in combination with RA on the viability, adhesion,migration, invasion and expression of migration-related proteins in SKBR3 andBT-474 human breast cancer cells. MTT, pharmacological interaction analysis,immunofluorescence, adhesion/migration/invasion and Western blot assays wereperformed. The coadministration of both drugs synergistically decreased cellsurvival. Tz+RA significantly decreased adhesion/migration/invasion in both cell types. Tz+RA strongly reduced FAK and HER2 expression and induced nuclear FAKtranslocation. In addition, a granular distribution of HER2 receptor was observedafter the combined treatment. In conclusion, the coadministration of both drugsin patients with this type of cancer could contribute to the improvement of theirprognosis and reduce the adverse effects of therapy because the applied Tz doses would be lower due to the adjuvant effect of RA.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25480 PMCID: PMC5995169PMID: 29899874
