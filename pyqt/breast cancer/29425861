Electronic address:guohua-an@uiowa.edu.Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are a novel and target-specific class ofanticancer drugs. One drawback of TKI therapy is cancer resistance to TKI. Animportant TKI resistance mechanism is enhanced efflux of TKI by effluxtransporters, such as Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), in cancer cells.5,7-Dimethoxyflavone (5,7-DMF) is a natural flavonoid which was recently reportedto be a potent BCRP inhibitor. In the current study, the effect of 5,7-DMF on thedisposition of sorafenib, a TKI which is a good substrate of BCRP, wasinvestigated both in vitro in efflux transporter expressing cells and in vivo in mice. 5,7-DMF significantly inhibited Bcrp1-mediated sorafenib efflux in aconcentration dependent manner in MDCK/Bcrp1 cells, with EC50 value of 8.78 μM.The pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of sorafenib (10 mg/kg) with andwithout co-administration of 75 mg/kg 5,7-DMF were determined. With 5,7-DMF, the AUC of sorafenib in plasma was 47,400 ± 4790 ng·h/mL, which was significantlyhigher than 27,300 ± 2650 ng·h/mL in sorafenib alone group. In addition, comparedto sorafenib alone group, great increase in sorafenib AUC was observed in mosttissues collected when sorafenib was given with 5,7-DMF. Our results indicatedthat 5,7-DMF may represent a novel and very promising chemosensitizing agent for BCRP-mediated anticancer drug resistance due to its low toxicity and potent BCRP inhibition.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
