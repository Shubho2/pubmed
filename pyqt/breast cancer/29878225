As per study protocol, menopausal status was collected in allpatients at random assignment and at week 37 visit. We investigated TRA rates andwhether TRA in patients with hormone receptor-positive and -negative tumors wouldimpact disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Landmark andtime-dependent modeling were used to account for guarantee-time bias. Allstatistical tests were two-sided.Results: A total of 2862 premenopausal women were included, of whom 1679 (58.7%) had hormone receptor-positive disease. Median age was 43 (interquartile range =38-47) years. Similar TRA rates were observed in the trastuzumab (72.6%),lapatinib (74.0%), trastuzumab→lapatinib (72.1%), and trastuzumab+lapatinib(74.8%) arms (P = .64). The association between TRA and survival outcomesdiffered according to hormone-receptor status (Pinteraction for DFS = .007;Pinteraction for OS = .003). For hormone receptor-positive patients, the TRAcohort had statistically significantly better DFS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.45 to 0.76) and OS (aHR = 0.63, 95% CI =0.40 to 0.99) than the no TRA cohort. No difference was observed in hormonereceptor-negative patients.Conclusions: In this unplanned analysis, no association between TRA rate and typeof anti-HER2 treatment was observed. TRA was associated with statisticallysignificant survival benefits in premenopausal hormonereceptor-positive/HER2-positive early breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy094 PMID: 29878225
