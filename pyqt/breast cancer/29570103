Experts in screening programmemonitoring from the respective countries provided data. Coverage by invitationwas calculated as the proportion of individuals in the target age range receivinga screening invitation over the total number of annualized eligible population.The invitation strategies of 30 breasts, 25 cervical and 27 colorectal nationalor regional population-based screening programmes are described. Individual mail invitations are sent by 28 breasts, 20 cervical and 25 colorectal screeningprogrammes. Faecal occult blood test kits are sent by post in 17 of thecolorectal cancer screening programmes. The majority of programmes claimed tohave a population registry, although some use health insurance data as thedatabase for sending invitations. At least 95% invitation coverage was reached by16 breast, six cervical and five colorectal screening programmes. Majority of theprogrammes comply with the invitation strategies enumerated in the Europeanguidelines, although there is still scope for improvements. Coverage byinvitation is below the desirable level in many population-based cancer screeningprogrammes in European Union.DOI: 10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000426 PMID: 29570103
