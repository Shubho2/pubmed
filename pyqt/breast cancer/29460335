While significant effort has focused on targeting pathway-specific transporters, the role ofnanobiophysics in the cell lipid bilayer nanoparticle uptake pathway remainslargely unexplored. In this study, it is demonstrated that stiffness of lipidbilayer is a key determinant of uptake of liposomes by mammalian cells.Dynamin-mediated endocytosis (DME) of liposomes is found to correlate with itsphase behavior, with transition toward solid phase promoting DME, and transition toward fluidic phase resulting in dynamin-independent endocytosis. Sinceliposomes can transfer lipids to cell membrane, it is sought to engineer thebiophysical properties of the membrane of breast epithelial tumor cells(MD-MBA-231) by treatment with phosphatidylcholine liposomes, and elucidate itseffect on the uptake of polymeric nanoparticles. Analysis of the giant plasmamembrane vesicles derived from treated cells using flicker spectroscopy revealsthat liposome treatment alters membrane stiffness and DME of nanoparticles. Sinceliposomes have a history of use in drug delivery, localized priming of tumorswith liposomes may present a hitherto unexploited means of targeting tumors basedon biophysical interactions.Â© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
