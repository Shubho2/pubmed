No systematic reviews or meta-analyses have examined this association stratified by receptor status. Our objective is to conduct a systematic review toanswer the question, "Is there a relationship between lower serum/plasma vitamin D levels and increased risk of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)specifically?"METHODS: We systematically searched Embase and PubMed databases for publishedoriginal research studies examining the risk of a breast cancer diagnosisaccording to vitamin D status. We excluded studies that did not provide riskestimates stratified by receptor status.RESULTS: Fourteen studies met our criteria, including case-control, nestedcase-control, and case-series studies, reflecting the cumulative results of13,135 breast cancer cases. When grouped by relevancy to TNBC, the proportion of analyses across all study types showing a significant association between vitaminD status and breast cancer diagnosis was 37% for non-TNBC analyses, 48% foranalyses that included some TNBC cases, and 88% for TNBC analyses.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that low vitamin D status may particularlyincrease the risk of TNBC, although more research is needed to determine if this association is causative. Women should be routinely screened for 25(OH)Ddeficiency.DOI: 10.1080/01635581.2018.1470653 PMID: 29781719
