However, in vivo administration exhibited limited applications incancer therapies.RESULTS: Twenty-four curcumin derivatives have synthesized, which comprisescyclohexanone 1-10, acetone 11-17 and cyclopentanone 18-24 series. All thecurcuminoids were synthesized by the acid or base catalyzed ClaisenSchmidt condenstion reactions, in which β-diketone moiety of curcumin wasmodified with mono-ketone. These curcuminoids 1-24 were screened against HeLa,K562, MCF-7 (an estrogen-dependent) and MDA-MB-231 (an estrogen-independent)cancer cell lines. Among them, acetone series 11-17 were found to be moreselective and potential cytotoxic agents. The compound 14 was exhibited(IC50 = 3.02 ± 1.20 and 1.52 ± 0.60 µg/mL) against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cell lines. Among the cyclohexanone series, the compound 4 exhibited(IC50 = 11.04 ± 2.80, 6.50 ± 01.80, 8.70 ± 3.10 and 2.30 ± 1.60 µg/mL) potential cytotoxicity against four proposed cancer cell lines, respectively. All thecurcucminoids were characterized with the detailed 1H NMR, IR, UV-Vis, and massspectroscopic techniques. The structure of compound 4 was confirmed by using the single X-ray crystallography. Additionally, we are going to report the first timespectral data of (2E,6E)-2,6-bis(2-methoxybenzylidene)cyclohexanone (1).Structure-activity relationships revealed that the mono-carbonyl with2,5-dimethoxy substituted curcuminoids could be an essential for the future drugsagainst cancer diseases.CONCLUSIONS: Curcuminoids with diferuloyl(4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamoyl) moietywith mono carbonyl exhibiting potential cytotoxic properties. The compound 14 wasexhibited (IC50 = 3.02 ± 1.20 and 1.52 ± 0.60 µg/mL) against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231breast cancer cell lines.DOI: 10.1186/s13065-018-0398-1 PMCID: PMC5859007PMID: 29556774
