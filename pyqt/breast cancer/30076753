In the current study, we examined the expressionpattern of the miRNA miR-125a-5p in human BC tissues, tumorigenesis of BCprogression. We found that miR-125a-5p was significantly downregulated in humanBC tissues. Overexpression of miR-125a-5p in a xenograft mouse model indicatedthat miR-125a-5p may function as a tumour suppressor during carcinogenesis. Toexplore the molecular mechanism by which miR-125a-5p contributes to BCprogression, we predicted the target genes of miR-125a-5p and identified BCsusceptibility gene 1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) as a direct target. Finally, wedemonstrated that BAP1 had opposing effects to those of miR-125a-5p on BC cells, suggesting that miR-125a-5p may inhibit cell proliferation and promote cellapoptosis by negatively regulating BAP1. Taken together, our findings provide thefirst clues regarding the role of miR-125a-5p as a tumour suppressor in BC viathe inhibition of BAP1 translation.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcb.27124 PMID: 30076753
