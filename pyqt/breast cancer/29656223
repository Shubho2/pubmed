Oncoplastic techniques combined with breast conserving surgery (BCS) and radiotherapy has become an alternative to mastectomy in patients withnon-metastasized breast cancer. The aim of this study was to analyse the amountand types of complications occurring after oncoplastic BCS before and afteradjuvant radiotherapy and the delay of adjuvant therapy due to the complications.METHOD: A retrospective study based on all patients who received immediateoncoplastic BCS by a plastic surgeon at two medical hospitals in The Netherlands between 2013 and 2015. (n = 150). The performed oncoplastic BCS techniques werethe primary outcome measures. In particular major complications with the need forantibiotics or surgical intervention. A one-year follow-up was achieved for allpatients.RESULTS: 52% of the 150 included patients received an oncoplastic BCS through thereduction pattern, 35% with a LICAP and 10% with an AICAP. Complications occurredin 37.5% of the patients, 10% of the patients needed treatment with antibioticsand in 6.6% of the patients a revision operation was indicated. 79.6% of allpostoperative complications occurred before the start of adjuvant radiotherapy.In 8.2% of the patients the adjuvant radiotherapy had to be delayed due to acomplication.CONCLUSION: This study provides a detailed overview of the used techniques ofoncoplastic BCS and their postoperative complications. Most complicationsoccurred before the start of the adjuvant radiotherapy. Just a small amountcaused a delay for the radiotherapy to start.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
