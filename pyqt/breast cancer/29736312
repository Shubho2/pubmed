In this report, we sought todetermine whether focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression in this cell population influences primary breast tumor initiation and growth. Using the MMTV-polyomamiddle T (PyVmT) murine model of spontaneous breast cancer, we found that FAKexpression in mononuclear phagocytes accelerates tumor initiation/progressionduring the early stages of PyVmT tumor growth but subsequently restricts tumorgrowth once the tumors have transitioned to malignancy. Mononuclear phagocytesaccumulated at the site of developing tumors in a FAK-independent manner.However, once in the tumor, our data suggest that FAK expression is upregulatedin the tumor-associated myeloid cells, and its activity in this population ofcells may influence the immune landscape of the tumor by supporting therecruitment and/or survival of NK cells. Together, these data support a model in which FAK expression in the mononuclear phagocyte compartment positivelyregulates the early steps of tumor progression but subsequently functions torestrict tumor growth as the tumors transition to invasive carcinoma.PMCID: PMC5934557PMID: 29736312
