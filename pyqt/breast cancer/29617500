Univariate and multivariateanalysis were performed to identify covariates which significantly contribute to higher EuroSCORE II in our population. External validation was performed bycomparing the real and expected mortality using area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve (AUC) for discrimination assessment. Also, Brier Score andHosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were used to show the overall performanceand calibration level, respectively.RESULTS: Two thousand five hundred eight one (59.6% males) were included. Theobserved mortality rate was 3.3%, but EuroSCORE II had a prediction of 4.7%.Although the overall performance was acceptable (Brier score=0.047), the modelshowed poor discriminatory power by AUC=0.667 (sensitivity=61.90, andspecificity=66.24) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P<0.01).CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the EuroSCORE II discrimination power is lessthan optimal for outcome prediction and less accurate for resource allocationprograms. It highlights the need for recalibration of this risk stratificationtool aiming to improve post cardiac surgery outcome predictions in Iran.DOI: 10.21470/1678-9741-2017-0030 PMCID: PMC5873780PMID: 29617500
