We identified four cohorts of malebreast tissues diagnosed when obesity was rare (archival cohort) and more common (contemporary cohort). We examined the microenvironment of archival andcontemporary cohorts of MBC, diagnosed 1940-1970 and 1998-2006, respectively,with two cohorts of, archival and contemporary gynaecomastia, diagnosed 1940-1979and 1996-2011, respectively, serving as controls. We quantified adipocytes,crown-like structures (CLS) and the presence of CD8, α smooth muscle actin (αSMA)and CD68+ macrophages in both cohorts, and determined how these affectedsurvival, in the contemporary MBC cohort. In both MBC cohorts, mean adipocytediameter was larger in the distant stroma compared with stroma close to theinvading tumour (92.2 µm vs 66.7 µm). This was not seen in gynaecomastia. CLSwere more frequent in both MBC cohorts than gynaecomastia (44/55 (80%) vs 11/18(61%), P < 0.001). No relationship was found between CLS number and adipocytesize, although there were greater numbers of CLS in contemporary MBC > archivalMBC > gynaecomastia. CD8 and CD68 expression in the stroma was significantlyassociated with reduced survival, with no effects seen with αSMA. Changes in the adipose-inflammatory microenvironment may be a contributing factor to theincrease seen in MBC diagnosis.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-17-0407 PMID: 29743167
