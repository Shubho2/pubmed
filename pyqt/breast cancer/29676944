We developed and validated a simpleclinicopathologic tool (Clinical Treatment Score post-5 years [CTS5]) to estimateresidual risk of DR after 5 years of endocrine treatment. Patients and MethodsThe ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) data set (N = 4,735) was used to create a prognostic score for post-5-year risk of DR. Validity of CTS5(ATAC) was tested in the BIG 1-98 data set (N = 6,711). Time to late DR, 5 years after finishing scheduled endocrine therapy, was the primary end point. Coxregression models estimated the prognostic performance of CTS5 (ATAC). ResultsCTS5 (ATAC) was significantly prognostic for late DR in the ATAC cohort (hazardratio, 2.47; 95% CI, 2.24 to 2.73; P < .001) and BIG 1-98 validation cohort(hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.88 to 2.28; P < .001). CTS5 (ATAC) riskstratification defined in the training cohort as low (< 5% DR risk, years 5 to10), intermediate (5% to 10%), or high (> 10%) identified 43% of the validationcohort as low risk, with an observed DR rate of 3.6% (95% CI, 2.7% to 4.9%)during years 5 to 10. From years 5 to 10, 63% of node-negative patients were low risk, with a DR rate of 3.9% (95% CI, 2.9% to 5.3%), and 24% with one to threepositive nodes were low risk, with a DR rate of 1.5% (95% CI, 0.5% to 3.8%). Afinal CTS5 for future use was derived from pooled data from ATAC and BIG 1-98.Conclusion CTS5 is a simple tool based on information that is readily availableto all clinicians. CTS5 was validated as highly prognostic for late DR in theindependent BIG 1-98 study. The final CTS5 algorithm identified 42% of women with< 1% per-year risk of DR who could be advised of the limited potential value ofextended endocrine therapy.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.76.4258 PMCID: PMC6049399PMID: 29676944
