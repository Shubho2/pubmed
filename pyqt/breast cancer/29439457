Five intrinsic subtypes were initially identified-Luminal-A, Luminal-B, HER2‚Å∫, Triple negative/basal like (TNBC) and normal like-subsequently expanded to seven (Basal-like-1 and 2, mesenchymal, mesenchymal stem-like,luminal androgen receptor, immuno-modulatory and unstable). Although genetic and epigenetic changes are key pathogenic events, the immune system plays asubstantial role in promoting progression and metastasis. This review willdiscuss the extent to which immune cells can be detected within the tumormicroenvironment, as well as their prognostic role and relationship with themicrobiome, with an emphasis on TNBC.DOI: 10.3390/biomedicines6010020 PMCID: PMC5874677PMID: 29439457
