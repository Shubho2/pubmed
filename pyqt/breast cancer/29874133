This review summarizes recent literature on SMN epidemiology, risk factors, surveillance, and interventions. Survivors ofchildhood cancer experience long-term increased SMN risk compared with thegeneral population, with a greater than twofold increased solid tumor riskextending beyond age 40 years. There is a dose-dependent increased risk for solidtumors after radiotherapy, with the highest risks for tumors occurring in or nearthe treatment field (eg, greater than fivefold increased risk for breast, brain, thyroid, skin, bone, and soft tissue malignancies). Alkylating and anthracycline chemotherapies increase the risk for development of several solid malignancies inaddition to acute leukemia/myelodysplasia, and these risks may be modified byother patient characteristics, such as age at exposure and, potentially,inherited genetic susceptibility. Strategies for identifying survivors at riskand initiating long-term surveillance have improved and interventions areunderway to improve knowledge about late-treatment effects among survivors andcaregivers. Better understanding of treatment-related risk factors and geneticsusceptibility holds promise for refining surveillance strategies and,ultimately, upfront cancer therapies.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.76.7764 PMCID: PMC6075849 [Available on 2018-08-20]PMID: 29874133
