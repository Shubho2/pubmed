In this study, we assessed the chemomodulatory potential of TQ to gemcitabine (GCB) against human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), andductal carcinoma (T47D) cells. TQ showed cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 and T47Dwith IC50's of 64.9 ± 14 µM and 165 ± 2 µM, respectively. The IC50's of GCBagainst MCF-7 and T47D were 0.9 ± 0.18 µM and 14.3 ± 2.8 µM and weresignificantly reduced after combination with TQ to 0.058 ± 12 µM and2.3 ± 0.2 µM, respectively. The CI- values were indicative of synergism in MCF-7 and T47D cells (0.15 and 0.30, respectively). Further investigation showed thatGCB caused significant anti-proliferative effect reflected by increasing cellpopulation in S-phase in both cell lines. TQ potentiated GCB-inducedanti-proliferative activity in both cell lines. GCB induced considerableapoptosis in T47D cell line, and TQ significantly increased GCB-induced apoptoticeffects by 1.5 to 3.6 folds. Interestingly, GCB, TQ and their combination inducedsignificant autophagic cell death in the apoptosis defected MCF-7 cells. Inaddition, TQ, GCB and their combination depleted breast cancer associated stemcell (CD44(+)/CD24(-)/(low)) clone within MCF-7 and T47D cells by 3.8% to 27.5%. In conclusion, TQ showed promising chemomodulatory effects to GCB against breast cancer cells via inducing apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy, in addition todepleting tumor associated resistant stem cell fraction.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-30046-z PMCID: PMC6076303PMID: 30076320
