[Epubahead of print]Schiff base-containing dextran nanogel as pH-sensitive drug delivery system ofdoxorubicin: Synthesis and characterization.Su H(1), Zhang W(1), Wu Y(2), Han X(1), Liu G(2), Jia Q(1), Shan S(1).Author information: (1)1 Department of Chemical Engineering, Kunming University of Science andTechnology, Kunming, China.(2)2 Center for Molecular Imaging and Translational Medicine, School of PublicHealth, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.Stimuli-responsive hydrogels have been widely researched as carrier systems, due to their excellent biocompatibility and responsiveness to external physiologicenvironment factors. In this study, dextran-based nanogel with covalentlyconjugated doxorubicin (DOX) was developed via Schiff base formation using theinverse microemulsion technique. Since the Schiff base linkages areacid-sensitive, drug release profile of the DOX-loaded nanogel would bepH-dependent. In vitro drug release studies confirmed that DOX was released much faster under acidic condition (pH 2.0, 5.0) than that at pH 7.4. Approximately66, 28, and 9% of drug was released in 72 h at pH 2.0, 5.0, and 7.4,respectively. Cell uptake by the human breast cancer cell (MCF-7) demonstratedthat the DOX-loaded dextran nanogel could be internalized through endocytosis anddistributed in endocytic compartments inside tumor cells. These results indicatedthat the Schiff base-containing nanogel can serve as a pH-sensitive drug deliverysystem. And the presence of multiple aldehyde groups on the nanogel are availablefor further conjugations of targeting ligands or imaging probes.DOI: 10.1177/0885328218783969 PMID: 29940809
