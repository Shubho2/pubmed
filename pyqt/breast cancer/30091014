To promote health careequity in this high-risk population, we developed a community-academicpartnership (CAP) model to promote breast health education at communityfaith-based centers in the city of Milwaukee, WI. In this paper, we describe the success of our partnerships, our lessons learned, and future directions.DOI: 10.1007/s13187-018-1412-y PMID: 30091014
