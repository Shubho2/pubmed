It is known to negatively affect the quality of life (QoL) in breast cancer survivors. However, there are multiplequestionnaires used to measure QoL in lymphedema patients. The current studyaimed to determine the most complete and accurate questionnaire.METHODS: A systematic literature search in Cochrane Library database CENTRAL,MEDLINE, and EMBASE was conducted in August 2016 by two independent researchers. The strategy used for the search was: (("Lymphedema"[Mesh]) AND ("Quality oflife"[Mesh])). All QoL questionnaires for patients with breast cancer-relatedlymphedema (BCRL) were included. An overview of the assessed QoL domains and arm symptom-specific questions was made, to assess the most complete and accuratequestionnaire.RESULTS: A total of 142 studies were identified, of which 49 met the inclusioncriteria and 15 different questionnaires were extracted. The Lymphedema Qualityof Life Inventory (LyQLI), assesses all QoL domains, except for the possibilityof wearing the clothes of choice, and assess all specific arm symptoms. TheLymphedema Functioning, Disability, and Health (Lymph-ICF) Questionnaire assessesall QoL domains, except for sexual functioning, and does assess all specific arm symptoms.CONCLUSION: According to the results obtained, the LyQLI and Lymph-ICFquestionnaires were the two most complete and accurate questionnaires to assessQoL in patients with BCRL, because these questionnaires assess the largest numberof QoL domains and specific arm symptoms.DOI: 10.1089/lrb.2017.0046 PMID: 29437542
