[Epub ahead of print]Axillary reverse mapping (ARM): where to go.Shao X(1), Sun B(2), Shen Y(2).Author information: (1)Department of Surgical Oncology, Second Affiliated Hospital of ZhejiangUniversity, Hangzhou, 310009, Zhejiang, China. surg2000@sina.com.(2)Institute of Translational Medicine, Zhejiang University School of Medicine,Hangzhou, 310029, Zhejiang, China.In the past decades, breast surgeons have changed the clinical practice in thesurgical treatment of breast cancer, by performing sentinel lymph node biopsy(SLNB) instead of performing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in axillarylymph node clinically negative breast cancer patients. ALND can also be avoidedin SLN-positive patients who meet the Z-0011 criteria. However, the postoperativecomplications of SLNB and ALND, such as the secondary upper extremity lymphedema,are common and need effective solutions to prevent as soon as possible. Theaxillary reverse mapping (ARM) technique has been developed to map and preservearm lymphatic drainage during ALND and/or SLNB, thereby minimizing armlymphedema. However, the success of ARM in reducing lymphedema has not beenexactly determined. If ARM can be confirmed to be both effective andoncologically safe in preventing lymphedema, this technique should be recommendedin the management of breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0886-0 PMID: 29961238
