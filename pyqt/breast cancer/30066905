China.Tamoxifen (TAM) resistance is a substantial challenge in the treatment ofestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Previous studies have revealed an important role of microRNA (miRNA/miR)-26a in TAM resistance in breast cancer.However, the mechanism underlying the regulatory effects of miR-26a on TAMresistance remains to be elucidated. The expression levels of miR-26a inER-positive breast cancer were detected by reverse transcription-quantitativepolymerase chain reaction. E2F transcription factor 7 (E2F7) and MYCproto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (MYC) levels were detected by westernblotting. The present study demonstrated that miR-26a expression was reduced inER-positive breast cancer compared with in normal breast tissues, whereas E2F7expression was significantly elevated. Furthermore, an inverse correlationbetween miR-26a and E2F7 expression was detected in ER-positive breast cancer.The results indicated that miR-26a directly inhibited E2F7 expression throughtranslational inhibition and indirectly inhibited MYC expression partly via E2F7 repression. E2F7, in turn, decreased miR-26a expression via MYC-inducedtranscriptional inhibition of miRNAs. Furthermore, transfection with miR-26amimics increased the expression of its host genes (CTD small phosphatase like andCTD small phosphatase 2), whereas ectopic E2F7 expression abrogated the effectsof miR-26a. These findings indicated that miR-26a and E2F7 may form adouble-negative feedback loop, resulting in downregulation of miR-26a andupregulation of E2F7 in ER-positive breast cancer. Both miR-26a knockdown andE2F7 overexpression conferred resistance to TAM in MCF-7 cells. Conversely,miR-26a overexpression and E2F7 silencing resensitized MCF-7 resistant cells toTAM. These findings revealed that a feedback loop between miR-26a and E2F7 maypromote TAM resistance in ER-positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4492 PMID: 30066905
