Therefore, the positive effect of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapyplays an important role in breast cancer treatment. Several randomized trialshave studied bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting in postmenopausal woman and demonstrated their potential to prevent treatment-induced bone loss. Theprevention of fractures and the subsequent preservation of patients' quality oflife are important arguments for the use of adjuvant bisphosphonates inpostmenopausal breast cancer patients. In addition, trials of adjuvantbone-targeted agents showed a reduction of recurrences in and outside bone and animproved outcome in patients treated with bisphosphonates.DOI: 10.1007/s11864-018-0535-z PMID: 29527635
