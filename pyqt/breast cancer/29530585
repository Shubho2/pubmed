Electronic address:alexch84@gmail.com.(2)Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.PURPOSE: We used the National Cancer Data Base to analyze practice patterns ofadjuvant breast radiotherapy (RT) in elderly patients to see if a difference inoverall survival (OS) could be detected. Additionally, we investigated factorsthat affected OS in these patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women aged ≥ 65 years with hormone receptor-positive andhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative pathologic T1-T2N0M0invasive breast cancer measuring up to 3 cm who were treated with breastconservation and adjuvant endocrine therapy without adjuvant chemotherapy wereidentified and stratified by use of adjuvant RT. Multivariable Cox proportionalhazards modeling was used to examine the association of treatment and mortalityadjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinicopathologic factors.Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate overall 5-year survival in patientswho did or did not receive adjuvant RT, and to compare those groups.RESULTS: A total of 61,395 patients with a median follow-up of 48.7 months(range, 0-107 months) were identified. On Cox regression analysis, improved OSwas associated with treatment at an academic facility, younger age, higher incomelevel, lower Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index, and receipt of adjuvant RT (all P <.05). The overall 5-year survival rate was 93.0% (95% confidence interval92.7-93.3) in the adjuvant RT group and 83.6% (95% confidence interval 82.5-84.7)in the nonadjuvant RT group (P < .0001).CONCLUSION: Improved survival is associated with the receipt of adjuvant RT forolder women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative breastcancer who received adjuvant endocrine therapy. However, there are manylimitations inherent to a retrospective database study such as ours, so thefindings should be taken with caution.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
