The aim of this study is to analyzechanges in breast and cervical cancer incidence and mortality trends using datafrom the Russian State Cancer Registry.METHODS: The age-standardized rates of cervical cancer incidence (1993-2013) and mortality (1980-2013) were analyzed using piecewise linear regression.Age-period-cohort models were used to estimate the temporal effects and providefuture predictions.RESULTS: Breast and cervical cancer incidence rates uniformly increased over two decades from 33.0 to 47.0 per 100,000 and from 10.6 to 14.2 per 100,000,respectively. Breast cancer mortality rates however declined from 17.6 to 15.7 in2013, while cervical cancer mortality increased steadily from 5.6 to 6.7.Breakpoints in the risk occurred in cohorts born 1937-1953, indicating a recentgenerational decrease in breast cancer mortality, but a concomitant increase incervical cancer. Cervical cancer has already surpassed breast cancer in terms of years of life lost (YLL) (23.4 per death vs 18.5 in 2009-2013), while futureprojections suggest that the annual YLL could reach 1.2 million for cervicalcancer and (decline to) 1.8 million for breast cancer by the year 2030.CONCLUSION: The temporal patterns of breast cancer incidence and mortality inRussia are in line with other countries in Europe, although cervical cancer ratesand the risk of occurrence in recent generations is rapidly increasing; thesetrends underscore the need to place immediate priority in national cervicalvaccination and screening programs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
