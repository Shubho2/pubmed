Electronic address:t.nyokong@ru.ac.za.In this work, we report on the synthesis oftris-[(2,2,7,7-tetramethyltetrahydro-3aH-bis([1,3]dioxolo)[4,5-b:4',5'-d]pyran-5-yl)methoxy)-2-(4-benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylphenoxyphthalocyaninato] zinc(II) (complex3) and its linkage to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of different shapes throughS-Au/N-Au self-assembly. The conjugates of complex 3 (with both gold nanorods(AuNR) and nanospheres (AuNS)), displayed decreased fluorescence quantum yieldwith corresponding improved triplet and singlet quantum yields compared tocomplex 3 alone, however 3-AuNR showed improved properties than 3-AuNS. Complex 3showed relatively low in vitro dark cytotoxicity against the epithelial breastcancer cells with cell survival ≥ 85% at concentration ≤ 160 μg/mL but affordedreduced photodynamic therapy activity which may be due to aggregation. 3-AuNRafforded superior PDT activity with <50% viable cells at concentration ≥ 40 μg/mLin comparison to 3-AuNS with <50% viable cells at concentration ≥ 80 μg/mL. Thesuperior activity of 3-AuNR is attributed to the photothermal therapy effectsince nanorods absorb more light at 680 nm than nanospheres.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
