Chemotherapy toxicitymakes a significant clinical problem due to decreased quality of life,prolongation of treatment and reinforcement of negative emotions associated with therapy. In this study we evaluated the genetic and clinical risk factors of FAC chemotherapy-related toxicities in the group of 324 breast cancer patients.Selected genes and their polymorphisms were involved in FAC drugs transport(ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2,SLC22A16), metabolism (ALDH3A1, CBR1, CYP1B1, CYP2C19, DPYD,GSTM1, GSTP1, GSTT1, MTHFR,TYMS), DNA damage recognition, repair and cell cyclecontrol (ATM, ERCC1, ERCC2, TP53, XRCC1). The multifactorial risk models thatcombine genetic risk modifiers and clinical characteristics were constructed for 12 toxic symptoms. The majority of toxicities was dependent on the modifications in components of more than one pathway of FAC drugs, while the impact level ofclinical factors was comparable to the genetic ones. For the carriers of multiplehigh risk factors the chance of developing given symptom was significantlyelevated which proved the factor-dosage effect. We found the strongestassociations between concurrent presence of clinical factors - overall andrecurrent anemia, nephrotoxicity and early nausea and genetic polymorphisms ingenes responsible for DNA repair, drugs metabolism and transport pathways. These results indicate the possibility of selection of the patients with expected high tolerance to FAC treatment and consequently with high chance of chemotherapycompletion without the dose reduction, treatment delays and decline in thequality of life.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24148 PMCID: PMC5823653PMID: 29507678
