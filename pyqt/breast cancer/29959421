One critical question with these tumors is identifying which patients will receive added benefit from adjuvantchemotherapy. Nuclear pleomorphism (variance in nuclear shape and morphology) is an important constituent of breast grading schemes, and in ER+ cases, the gradeis highly correlated with disease outcome. This study aimed to investigatewhether quantitative computer-extracted image features of nuclear shape andorientation on digitized images of hematoxylin-stained and eosin-stained tissueof lymph node-negative (LN-), ER+ BCa could help stratify patients into discrete (<10 years short-term vs. >10 years long-term survival) outcome groupsindependent of standard clinical and pathological parameters. We considered atissue microarray (TMA) cohort of 276 ER+, LN- patients comprising 150 patientswith long-term and 126 patients with short-term overall survival, wherein 177randomly chosen cases formed the modeling set, and 99 remaining cases the testset. Segmentation of individual nuclei was performed using multiresolutionwatershed; subsequently, 615 features relating to nuclear shape/texture andorientation disorder were extracted from each TMA spot. The Wilcoxon's rank-sumtest identified the 15 most prognostic quantitative histomorphometric featureswithin the modeling set. These features were then subsequently combined via alinear discriminant analysis classifier and evaluated on the test set to assign aprobability of long-term vs. short-term disease-specific survival. In univariate survival analysis, patients identified by the image classifier as high risk hadsignificantly poorer survival outcome: hazard ratio (95% confidentinterval) = 2.91(1.23-6.92), p = 0.02786. Multivariate analysis controlling forT-stage, histology grade, and nuclear grade showed the classifier to beindependently predictive of poorer survival: hazard ratio (95% confidentinterval) = 3.17(0.33-30.46), p = 0.01039. Our results suggest that quantitative histomorphometric features of nuclear shape and orientation are strongly andindependently predictive of patient survival in ER+, LN- BCa.DOI: 10.1038/s41374-018-0095-7 PMID: 29959421
