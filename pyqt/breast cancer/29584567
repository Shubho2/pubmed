Aproportion of patients present with advanced age and comorbidities, and becomeineligible for surgery. The optimal treatment strategy of these patients remains a clinical challenge. Aromatase inhibitor (AI) combined withGonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) possesses profound effect insuppressing the estrogen level, has become a valid treatment in the breastcancer. However, the combined use of an AI and a GnRH-a in EC has rarely beenstudied.CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report the combination of an AI and a GnRH-a in thetreatment of three patients with advanced age or comorbidities who wereineligible for surgery. The disease remained stable for two years in patients whoreceived the combination treatment as an initial approach without any adverseeffects. Moreover, an AI combined with a GnRH-a also effective as salvagetreatment of recurrent patients. Further, we provide a brief review of theliterature.CONCLUSION: The combination of an AI and a GnRH-a presents satisfactorytherapeutic effect and provides an optimal option for inoperable EC patients.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2018.1456609 PMID: 29584567
