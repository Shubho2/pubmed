A Goldilocksmastectomy does not require the use of implants or tissue transfer from otherparts of the body and may be completed in a single surgery. This is best suitedfor larger breasted women who are willing to have much smaller breasts as aresult. Previously, it was a challenge to be able to preserve the nipples whenthis operation was performed; however, this article describes a patient who had abilateral Goldilocks mastectomy for right breast cancer who was able to save her nipples by keeping the blood flow in place from the surrounding skin.Conventional breast reconstruction after mastectomy is a challenge for largerbreasted women. The Goldilocks mastectomy technique was designed to make best useof the redundant lower pole skin and subcutaneous fat to recreate a breast mound without a prosthetic implant or autologous tissue transfer. In its originaldescription, the Goldilocks mastectomy did not include a means for nipplepreservation. In this report, we describe the further refinement of theGoldilocks procedure that preserves the nipple areolar complex using a dermalpedicle. A patient with large pendulous breasts and right breast carcinomaunderwent a bilateral Goldilocks nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediatereconstruction without an implant or flap.DOI: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000001748 PMCID: PMC5977972PMID: 29876184
