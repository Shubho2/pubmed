Recent studies suggestedthat dysregulation was observed in not only tRNAs, but also tRNA derivativesgenerated by the specific cleavage of pre- and mature tRNAs in the progression ofcancer. Accumulating evidence had identified that certain tRNAs and tRNAderivatives were involved in proliferation, metastasis and invasiveness of cancercell, as well as tumor growth and angiogenesis in several malignant human tumors.This paper reviews the importance of the dysregulation of tRNAs and tRNAderivatives during the development of cancer, such as breast cancer, lung cancer,and melanoma, aiming at a better understanding of the tumorigenesis and providingnew ideas for the treatment of these cancers.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0745-z PMCID: PMC5944149PMID: 29743091
