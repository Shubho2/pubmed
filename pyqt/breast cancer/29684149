Bleeding/discharge,offensive odor, pain and QOL scores were evaluated before and 1, 3 and 6 monthsafter radiotherapy.Results: Twenty-one patients were assessed. Sixteen patients (76%) received 36 Gyin 12 fractions. The mean (±1 SD) score of bleeding/discharge was 1.90 ± 0.89before radiotherapy, 1.50 ± 0.74 at 1 month, 0.47 ± 0.58 at 3 months, and 0.82 ± 1.04 at 6 months (P = 0.001). The mean score of offensive odor was 1.21 ± 1.38before radiotherapy, 0.71 ± 0.92 at 1 month, 0.20 ± 0.41 at 3 months, and 0.27 ± 0.62 at 6 months (P = 0.008). The mean score of pain was 2.90 ± 1.22 beforeradiotherapy, 3.05 ± 1.36 at 1 month, 3.29 ± 1.10 at 3 months, and 3.31 ± 1.54 at6 months (P = 0.431). The mean total score of QOL-ACD/QOL-ACD-B was 126.2 ± 24.5 before radiotherapy, 130.3 ± 26.3 at 1 month, 136.2 ± 26.6 at 3 months, and 126.6± 32.8 at 6 months (P = 0.178).Conclusion: Palliative radiotherapy for skin invasion in patients with breastcancer might be effective, especially for the relief of bleeding/discharge andoffensive odor.DOI: 10.1093/jjco/hyy054 PMID: 29684149  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
