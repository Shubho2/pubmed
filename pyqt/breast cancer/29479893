The purpose of this researchwas to determine the clinical value of measuring the expression level ofhsa-miR-221-3p in breast cancer tissues and evaluate its biological andprognostic importance in breast cancer (BC).METHODS: A total of 40 tumor samples and matched tumor-free margin specimens wereobtained during surgery from patients with BC. After total RNA extraction andcDNA synthesis, the relative expression level of hsa-miR221-3p in tumor andmarginal tissues was examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, theassociation between hsa-miR-221-3p expression and clinicopathological features ofpatients was detected.RESULTS: The relative expression level of hsa-miR-221-3p in BC tissues wassignificantly higher than that in adjacent noncancerous breast biopsies (p â‰¤0.0001). Also, there was no significant association between hsa-miR-221-3pexpression with clinicopathological characteristics (p > 0.05). The receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses also represented an optimum cutoff point of < 4.34 to show that hsa-miR-221-3p is an effective molecular biomarkerfor BC diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrated that analysis of hsa-miR-221-3p relative geneexpression may be applied as a biomarker for screening BC patients and could be asubstantial tool in diagnosis and prognosis. Also, that could be advantageous in decreasing surgical mistakes in tumor elimination through the surgery andenhancing all over the progression of surgery with reformed tumor clearance.PMID: 29479893
