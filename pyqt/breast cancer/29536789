[Epub ahead of print]In case of anastrozole-related hallucinations, can switching to letrozole be atreatment option? A case report and literature review.Bozkaya Y(1), Erdem GU(2), Demirci NS(3).Author information: (1)1 Clinic of Medical Oncology, Edirne State Hospital, Edirne, Turkey.(2)2 Department of Medical Oncology, University of Health Sciences, KocaeliDerince Training and Research Hospital, Kocaeli, Turkey.(3)3 Clinic of Medical Oncology, Tekirdağ State Hospital, Tekirdağ, Turkey.Arthralgia, myalgia, paresthesia, reduced bone mineral density, vasomotor sideeffects including hot flashes and night sweats, genitourinary symptoms including decreased libido, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia are common side effects ofaromatase inhibitors. Unlike the common side effects, the information onneurological side effects like hallucination of aromatase inhibitor was limitedin literature cases. Herein, we reported a case of hallucination related toanastrozole in a patient with metastatic breast cancer. A 62-year-old femalepatient with breast cancer developed repetitive hallucinations on the followingdays of anastrozole initiation. There was no other significant finding in thedifferential diagnosis of hallucination. Neurological symptoms disappeared after termination of anastrozole. The patient had no neuropsychiatric complaints duringletrozole treatment. We aimed to emphasize that neurological side effect likehallucination may rarely occur during the treatment of anastrozole and in case ofaromatase inhibitor-related hallucinations, switching to another aromataseinhibitor (letrozole) can be a treatment option.DOI: 10.1177/1078155218762626 PMID: 29536789
