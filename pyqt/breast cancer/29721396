Secretion of TGFβ and upregulation of immune checkpoint programmed cell deathligand-1 (PD-L1) are two main contributors to immune evasion and tumorprogression. Here, we examined the efficacy of a first-in-class bifunctionalcheckpoint inhibitor, the fusion protein M7824, comprising the extracellulardomain of human TGFβRII (TGFβ Trap) linked to the C-terminus of human anti-PD-L1 heavy chain (αPD-L1). We demonstrate that M7824 reduces plasma TGFβ1, binds toPD-L1 in the tumor, and decreases TGFβ-induced signaling in the tumormicroenvironment in mice. In murine breast and colon carcinoma models, M7824decreased tumor burden and increased overall survival as compared to targetingTGFβ alone. M7824 treatment promoted CD8+ T cell and NK cell activation, and bothof these immune populations were required for optimal M7824-mediated tumorcontrol. M7824 was superior to TGFβ- or αPD-L1-targeted therapies when incombination with a therapeutic cancer vaccine. These findings demonstrate thevalue of using M7824 to simultaneously target TGFβ and PD-L1/PD-1immunosuppressive pathways to promote anti-tumor responses and efficacy. Thestudies also support the potential clinical use of M7824 as a monotherapy or incombination with other immunotherapies, such as therapeutic cancer vaccines,including for patients who have progressed on αPD-L1/αPD-1 checkpoint blockadetherapies.DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1426519 PMCID: PMC5927523PMID: 29721396
