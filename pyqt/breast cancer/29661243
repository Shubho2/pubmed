We hypothesizethat once pCR has been achieved, there is no difference in subsequentpostsurgical recurrence-free survival (RFS), whichever NACT regimen is used.METHODS: Data from patients with breast cancer who achieved pCR after NACTbetween 1996 and 2011 were reviewed. RFS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meiermethod, and differences between groups were assessed using log-rank testing. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for age, menopausal status,stage, grade, tumor subtype, and adjuvant endocrine HER2-targeted radiationtreatment.RESULTS: Among 721 patients who achieved pCR after NACT, 157 (21.8%) were hormonereceptor-positive (HR), 310 (43.3%) were HER2-amplified, and 236 (32.7%) weretriple-negative; 292 (40.5%) were stage IIA, 153 (21.2%) were stage IIB, 78(10.8%) were stage IIIA, 66 (9.2%) were stage IIIB, and 132 (18.3%) were stageIIIC. Most patients (367 [50.9%]) had been treated with adriamycin-basedchemotherapy plus taxane (A + T), 56 (7.8%) without taxane (A no T), 227 (31.5%) with HER2-targeted therapy, and 71 (9.8%) provider choice. Median follow-up was7.1 years. Adjuvant chemotherapy was employed in 196 (27%) patients, adjuvantendocrine in 261 (36%), and adjuvant radiation in the majority (559 [77.5%]).There was no statistically significant difference in RFS by NACT group. Adjusted RFS hazard ratios, comparing each treatment with the reference group A + T, were 1.25 (95% CI 0.47-3.35) for A no T, 0.90 (95% CI 0.37-2.20) for HER2-targetedtherapy, and 1.28 (95% CI 0.55-2.98) for provider choice.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that postsurgical RFS is not significantlyinfluenced by the choice of NACT or cancer subtype among patients achieving pCR.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0945-7 PMCID: PMC5902970PMID: 29661243
