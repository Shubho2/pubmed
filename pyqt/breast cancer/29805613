China.Notch4, a family member of the Notch signaling pathway, has important roles incellular developmental pathways, including proliferation, differentiation andapoptosis. The present study aimed to investigate the association between Notch4 expression and clinical outcomes with immunohistochemistry. Notch4 was expressed in 55.6% of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), 45.8% of Her-2-overexpressingand 25.5% of luminal breast cancer cases, with significantly higher expressionoccurring in TNBC (P<0.05). Furthermore, Notch4 expression was inverselyassociated with estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor positivity,and positively associated with larger tumor size, more lymph node involvement,and more advanced tumor node metastasis stage (P<0.05). No significantassociation was identified regarding age, menopausal status, Her-2 status ordistant metastasis. Univariate survival analysis revealed that patients with low Notch4-expressing tumors exhibited a lower relative risk of cancer recurrencecompared with patients with high Notch4-expressing tumors. However, in theluminal cohort, high Notch4 expression conferred significantly lower 5-yearoverall survival (OS) rates compared with Notch4 low-expression groups (P=0.003) but not in TNBC and Her-2-overexpressing patients. In conclusion, Notch4expression was significantly higher in patients with TNBC andHer-2-overexpressing breast cancer compared with luminal breast cancer patients. Notch4 expression is associated with aggressive clinicopathological andbiological phenotypes, and may predict poor prognosis in luminal breast cancerpatients.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8442 PMCID: PMC5958688PMID: 29805613
