The site of metastasis to bone and the prognosis depend chiefly on the primary tumor. Despite all the advances in diagnostic techniques, identifyingthe primary tumor has not improved significantly.METHODS: A total of 576 cases (Lebanon; n = 306, Pakistan; n = 270) presentingwith microscopic evidence of metastasis to bone were reviewed between 1996 and2016. Clinical and radiologic data were recorded.RESULTS: Out of 20 types of primary tumors, unknown primary (38.2%), followed by breast (23.8%), lung (10.4%) and thyroid (4.9%) tumors were the most commonlypresenting with bone metastasis. The primary source of the tumor showedsignificant correlation with the site of metastasis, time lag to metastasis andradiologic presentation (p < 0.001). Interestingly, a significant variation wasnoted between the 2 observed populations.CONCLUSION: The patterns of pathologically confirmed metastasis to skeletal sitesin Near East population showed a special distribution, and variation was evenobserved between the 2 studied centers. Understanding the biologic variations of the primary tumors in our population may further explain the variation inpatterns of metastasis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
