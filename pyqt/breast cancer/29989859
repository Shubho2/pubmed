Patients and Methods Between 2011 and2013, 1,000 patients with breast cancer who underwent RT were evaluatedprospectively for skin toxicities through the National Cancer Institute-fundedWake Forest University Community Clinical Oncology Program Research Base. Pre-and post-RT plasma hsCRP levels and Oncology Nursing Society skin toxicitycriteria (0 to 6) were used to assess RT-induced skin toxicities. Multivariablelogistic regression analyses were applied to ascertain the associations betweenhsCRP and RT-induced skin toxicities after adjusting for potential confounders.Results The study comprised 623 white, 280 African American, 64 Asian/PacificIslander, and 33 other race patients; 24% of the patients were Hispanic, and 47% were obese. Approximately 42% and 15% of patients developed RT-induced grade 3+and 4+ skin toxicities, respectively. The hsCRP levels differed significantly by race and body mass index but not by ethnicity. In multivariable analysis, grade4+ skin toxicity was significantly associated with obesity (odds ratio [OR],2.17; 95% CI, 1.41 to 3.34], post-RT hsCRP â‰¥ 4.11 mg/L (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07 to2.44), and both factors combined (OR, 3.65; 95% CI, 2.18 to 6.14). Above-medianpost-RT hsCRP (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.63), and change in hsCRP (OR, 2.80;95% CI, 1.42 to 5.54) were significantly associated with grade 4+ skin toxicityin nonobese patients. Conclusion This large prospective study is the first to ourknowledge of hsCRP as an inflammatory biomarker in RT-induced skin toxicities in breast cancer. We demonstrate that nonobese patients with elevated RT-relatedchange in hsCRP levels have a significantly increased risk of grade 4+ skintoxicity. The outcomes may help to predict RT responses and guide decisionmaking.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.77.1790 PMID: 29989859
