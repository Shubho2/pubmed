Inconsistencies relate to definitions, incidence, staging and intertumoral heterogeneity. The primary aimof this systematic review was to compare clinical outcomes after BCS versusmastectomy for MF and MC cancers, collectively defined as multiple ipsilateralbreast cancers (MIBC).Methods: Comprehensive electronic searches were undertaken to identify completepapers published in English between May 1988 and July 2015, primarily comparingclinical outcomes of BCS and mastectomy for MIBC. All study designs wereincluded, and studies were appraised critically using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.The characteristics and results of identified studies were summarized.Results: Twenty-four retrospective studies were included in the review: 17comparative studies and seven case series. They included 3537 women with MIBCundergoing BCS; breast cancers were defined as MF in 2677 women, MC in 292, andreported as MIBC in 568. Six studies evaluated MIBC treated by BCS or mastectomy,with locoregional recurrence (LRR) rates of 2-23 per cent after BCS at medianfollow-up of 59·5 (i.q.r. 56-81) months. BCS and mastectomy showed apparentlyequivalent rates of LRR (risk ratio 0·94, 95 per cent c.i. 0·65 to 1·36).Thirteen studies compared BCS in women with MIBC versus those with unifocalcancers, reporting LRR rates of 2-40 per cent after BCS at a median follow-up of 64 (i.q.r. 57-73) months. One high-quality study reported 10-year actuarial LRRrates of 5·5 per cent for BCS in 300 women versus 6·5 per cent for mastectomyamong 887 women.Conclusion: The available studies were mainly of moderate quality, historical andunderpowered, with limited follow-up and biased case selection favouring BCSrather than mastectomy for low-risk patients. The evidence was inconclusive,weakening support for the St Gallen consensus and supporting a future randomized trial.DOI: 10.1002/bjs5.53 PMCID: PMC6069349PMID: 30079385
