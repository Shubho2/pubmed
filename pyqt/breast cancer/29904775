The phospha-Mannich protocol works with multiple proteins and installs probes without structural and functional perturbations. It delivers an antibody-drug conjugate with selectiveanti-proliferative activity towards HER2 expressing SKBR3 breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1039/c8cc03311k PMID: 29904775  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
