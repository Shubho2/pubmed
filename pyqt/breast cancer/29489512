Tomsich Pathology & LabMedicine Institute.(2)Hematology and Oncology Department Cleveland, OH.Mammary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is classically treated by combinations ofexcision, radiation, and endocrine therapy, based upon the specific needs ofindividual patients. Estrogen receptor (ER) status is generally assessed byimmunohistochemistry (IHC) in newly diagnosed cases of DCIS, and endocrinetherapy in this setting is thought to be chemopreventive. The potential impact ofandrogens on mammary carcinogenesis has been studied in recent years, and severalauthors have proposed androgen receptor (AR) IHC testing and targetedantiandrogenic therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatictriple-negative invasive breast cancer (ie, negative for ER and progesteronereceptor and HER-2). Very little has been published on AR in DCIS. We reportresults of AR IHC on archival tissue blocks from 221 adult female patients, each of whom underwent definitive breast resection of DCIS. Of the 221 cases, 72 (33%)were shown to express AR in their DCIS at or above the 10% threshold often usedfor invasive carcinoma. AR expression was seen in all grades of DCIS. Of the 72positive AR cases, 21 (29%) were ER negative, corresponding to 10% (21/221) ofall patients. The majority of the AR-positive cases were high grade, and the mostcommon histologic subtype in this subset was a solid growth pattern with apocrinefeatures. Early data from clinical trials evaluating AR antagonists ininvasive/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer suggest that some patients may benefit from androgen blockade. IHC testing and potential clinical trials of ARantagonists for chemoprevention in patients with AR-positive and ER-negative DCIScould be considered.DOI: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000625 PMID: 29489512
