We aimto review the pathogenesis and clinico-biological features of BI-ALCL.RECENT FINDINGS: BI-ALCL is a new provisional entity in the 2017 updated WHOclassification. Among several hypotheses, BI-ALCL development seems to bedetermined by the interaction of immune response related to implant products and additional genetic events.SUMMARY: BI-ALCL is an uncommon T-cell lymphoma which is increasingly diagnosedsince its first description in 1997 with 500 estimated cases worldwide. TwoBI-ALCL subtypes correlating with clinical presentation have been described.Although most BI-ALCL patients with tumor cell proliferation restricted to theperiprosthetic effusion and capsule have excellent outcomes, other patientspresenting with a tumor mass, may have a more aggressive disease. Thepathogenesis of BI-ALCL remains elusive. It is postulated that local chronicinflammation elicitated by bacterial infection or implant products may promotethe activation and proliferation of T cells. Additional genetic events resulting in the activation JAK/STAT pathway are also incriminated. Further investigations are needed to better characterize the pathogenesis of this disease in order todetermine the potential risk to develop BI-ALCL after surgical implants.DOI: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000476 PMID: 30096095
