We aimed to provide an overview ofthe current status of CD73 expression and its relationship withclinicopathlogical features and prognosis in different cancers.METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane library were searched toidentify the relevant studies. CD73 expression level in distinct cancers and its relationship with clinicopathlogical characteristics and prognosis wereinvestigated using online database. Meta-analyses were conducted using RevManv5.0 and STATA v12.0.RESULTS: Fourteen publications with 2951 cases were included. The incidence ofhigh CD73 expression was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.36-0.63). Data from Oncomine validatedthat median CD73 expression level in tumor tissues was markedly higher than that in normal tissues in most kinds of cancers except cecum adenocarcinoma andovarian cancer (P < 0.05). High CD73 expression was significantly correlated withshorter overall survival (OS) in various cancers (high risk [HR] = 1.48;P < 0.05). Subgroup analysis using online database demonstrated that high CD73expression was significantly correlated with poor OS in breast (HR = 1.23;P < 0.05) and ovarian cancer (HR = 1.14; P < 0.05), but favorable OS in lung(HR = 0.80; P < 0.05) and gastric cancer (HR = 0.71; P < 0.05). High CD73expression was dramatically associated with lymph node metastases (OR = 2.61;P = 0.05).CONCLUSION: High CD73 expression was significantly associated with lymph nodemetastases and a promising prognostic factor in different types of cancers.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4073-7 PMCID: PMC5842577PMID: 29514610
