A new approach isdesired for fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer (FRBC) therapy. This study aimsto find an effective approach to inhibit FRBC for patients with advanced breastcancer. MTT assay was first performed to detect the effect of inhibitors of c-ABL(imatinib) and EGFR (lapatinib) on FRBC cells. Microarray analysis was carriedout to identify microRNA which is significantly changed between parental and FRBCcells. The related mechanisms were analyzed by qRT-PCR, MTT, AO staining andwestern blotting. Dual treatment significantly inhibited cell growth of FRBC and upregulated microRNA-375 (miR-375). Overexpression of miR-375 inhibited growth ofFRBC cells, reduced autophagy, and decreased expression of ATG7 and LC3-II. Dual treatment elevated expression of miR-375 more than any single one of these twoinhibitors. Overexpression of miR-375 increased cell growth inhibition induced bydual treatment, and the effect was attenuated when miR-375 was inhibited. Inconclusion, we identified that combined inhibition of EGFR and c-ABL can suppressthe growth of FRBC cells and elucidated a mechanism within FRBC cells involvingregulation of miR-375 and autophagy. Dual treatment may be useful for inhibiting fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
