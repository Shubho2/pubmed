We evaluated the preliminary efficacy of acupuncture in preventingworsening CIPN in patients receiving paclitaxel.METHODS: In this phase IIA single-arm clinical trial, we screened stage I-IIIbreast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant/adjuvant weekly paclitaxel fordevelopment of CIPN. The primary objective was to assess acupuncture's efficacyin preventing the escalation of National Cancer Institute-Common ToxicityCriteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.0, grade II CIPN to highergrades. Acupuncture was deemed worthy of further study if 23 or more of the 27enrolled patients did not develop grade III CIPN. Outcome measures (NCI-CTCAECIPN grade, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic OncologyGroup-Neurotoxicity [FACT/GOG-Ntx], Neuropathic Pain Scale [NPS]) were obtainedweekly during the intervention.RESULTS: Of 104 patients screened, 37 developed grade II CIPN (36%), and 28 (27%)enrolled into the intervention phase; one was removed due to protocol violation. Of the 27 patients receiving acupuncture, 26 completed paclitaxel treatmentwithout developing grade III CIPN, meeting our prespecified success criteria for declaring acupuncture worthy of further study. FACT/GOG-Ntx and NPS scoresremained stable during the intervention while continuing weekly paclitaxel.Acupuncture treatment was well tolerated; 4 of 27 (15%) patients reported grade Ibruising.CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture was safe and showed preliminary evidence ofeffectiveness in reducing the incidence of high grade CIPN during chemotherapy. Afollow-up randomised controlled trial is needed to establish definitive efficacy in CIPN prevention for patients at risk.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
