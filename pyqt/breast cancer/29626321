Expression in tumor tissues and adjacent healthytissues of breast cancer patients, as well as in breast tissues and serum of bothpatients and healthy control was detected by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation wasdetected by CCK-8 assay, and cell apoptosis was tested by MTT assay. PlncRNA-1overexpression cell lines were constructed and the effects on TGF-β1 as well asphosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) were explored by western blot.RESULTS: Expression levels of PlncRNA-1 were significantly lower in tumor tissuesthan those in adjacent healthy tissues. Significantly lower expression levels of PlncRNA-1 were also found in breast cancer patients than those in healthycontrols in both breast tissue and serum. Upregulation of PlncRNA-1 promoted the expression of TGF-β1, but inhibited the expression of PHGDH. LncRNA PlncRNA-1overexpression reduced the proliferation rate, but increased the apoptosis rateof breast cancer cells, while treatment with TGF-β inhibitor reduced thoseeffects of PlncRNA-1 overexpression.CONCLUSION: LncRNA PlncRNA-1 overexpression inhibits the growth of breast cancer by upregulating TGF-β1 and downregulating PHGDH.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0858-4 PMID: 29626321
