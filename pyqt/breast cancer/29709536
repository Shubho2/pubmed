Electronic address: antonello.merlino@unina.it.The encapsulation of Pt and Au-based anticancer agents within a protein cage is apromising way to enhance the selectivity of these potential drugs. Here acytotoxic organometallic compound containing platinum(II) and gold(I) has beenencapsulated within a ferritin nanocage (AFt). Inductively plasma coupled massspectrometry data, collected to evaluate the amount of Pt and Au within the cage,indicate disruption of the starting heterobimetallic complex upon encapsulationwithin the nanocage. The drug-loaded protein (Pt(II)/Au(I)-AFt) has beencharacterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism and X-ray diffractionanalysis. Data indicate that the protein maintains its fold upon encapsulation ofthe metallodrug and that Au(I) and Pt(II)-containing fragments are encapsulatedwithin the AFt cage, with Au(I) ion that binds the side chain of Cys126 andPt(II) in the bulk, respectively. The in vitro cytotoxicity of Pt(II)Au(I)-AFt,as well as that of the free heterobimetallic complex, has been comparativelyevaluated on human cervix and breast cancer cells and against cardiomyoblasts andkeratinocytes non-tumorigenic cells. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to obtain a protein nanocarrier containing both Pt and Au atoms starting from abimetallic compound, opening the way for the design and development of newpotential drugs based on protein nanocarriers.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
