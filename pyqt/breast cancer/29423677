Although rash management is practiced, it isnot well characterized in the real-world setting. We describe the management ofrash that developed while receiving EGFR-inhibitor therapy and how rash affectstreatment duration, using Truven MarketScan® Research Database, a US medicalclaims database.METHODS: Adult patients who received EGFR-inhibitor treatment between 2004 and2015 after a diagnosis of colon, head and neck, lung, breast, or thyroid cancerwere identified. Descriptive analyses were conducted to describe occurrence ofrash during the EGFR-inhibitor treatment period, EGFR-inhibitor treatmentpersistence and management of rash, including treatment and cost.RESULTS: Of 44,533 eligible patients, 4649 (10.4%) had records of rash during theEGFR-inhibitor treatment period, and of patients experiencing rash, 2891 (62.2%) received prescription drugs for rash treatment. Treatment persistence with anEGFR inhibitor was longer among patients experiencing rash compared with no rash (median 178 vs. 80 days for EGFR-TKIs, 85 vs. 57 days for EGFR-monoclonalantibodies), especially among patients with rash who were treated for rash(208 days for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 104 days for EGFR- monoclonalantibodies). Annualized cost during EGFR-inhibitor treatment was lowest amongpatients not experiencing rash (US$185,619), followed by rash patients receiving drugs for rash management (US$215,561), and highest among rash patients nottreated for rash (US$267,105).CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that management of EGFR inhibitor-associatedrash could be important for EGFR-inhibitor treatment persistence.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4091-7 PMID: 29423677
