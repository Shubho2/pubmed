Thisstudy aimed to estimate the prevalence of anelloviral DNA in the Romanian humanpopulation and to investigate the association of infections with commonpathologies in Romanian population.METHODS: After informed consent, blood samples were collected from 2000 subjects represented by: clinically healthy individuals (n = 701) and a group of patients with pathologies linked to low grade inflammation or alteration of carbohydratemetabolism (n = 1299). All samples were analysed for the presence of TTV, TTMDVand TTMV DNA by hemi-nested PCR.RESULTS: The prevalence of TTV, TTMDV and TTMV in the studied population was68.2, 54.4%, respectively 40.1%, lower than the recent reports from othergeographic regions. The three viral species were significantly more frequent inthe group of patients compared to the healthy subjects and were associated withtype 2 diabetes mellitus. The presence of anelloviral DNA was also associatedwith medical procedures (e.g. haemodialysis/transfusions, surgical procedures)and previous hepatitis A virus infection. Lifestyle choices related to alcoholconsumption, smoking, physical activity and living environment were notassociated with differences in distribution of the three viruses.CONCLUSION: Further evidence is needed to establish a correlation betweeninfection with human anelloviruses and a pathology or group of pathologies.DOI: 10.1186/s12879-018-3248-9 PMCID: PMC6050727PMID: 30016934
