Reference region model was applied to analyze pharmacokinetic quantitative parametersincluding volume transfer constant (RR Ktrans), rate constant (Kep) and the ratioof Ktrans to extracellular space volume (Ktrans/Ve). The associations of theabove parameters with prognostic factors and molecular subtypes of breast cancer were analyzed.RESULTS: RR Ktrans and Kep were significantly higher in patients of histological grade 3 compared with those of histological grade 1 & 2 (all P<0.05); and thepatients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and/or progesterone receptor(PR)-negative also had higher RR Ktrans and Kep than those with ER-positive orPR-positive (all P<0.05). For immunohistochemistry, RR Ktrans and Kep weresignificantly higher in triple negative breast cancer compared with luminal type breast cancer (all P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: High RR Ktrans and Kep are associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer, and which can also be used to distinguish molecular subtypes of breastcancer.PMID: 29488717
