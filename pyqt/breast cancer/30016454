[Epub ahead of print]Circulating 27-Hydroxycholesterol and Breast Cancer Risk: Results From theEPIC-Heidelberg Cohort.Lu DL(1)(2), Le Cornet C(1), Sookthai D(1), Johnson TS(1), Kaaks R(1), FortnerRT(1).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg,Germany.(2)Medical Faculty Heidelberg, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.Background: 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) was the first identified endogenousselective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM); 27HC promoted growth and metastasisin experimental models of estrogen receptor-positive mammary cancer. There are nodata on prediagnosis circulating 27HC and breast cancer risk in women.Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study in the well-characterizedHeidelberg, Germany, cohort of the European Investigation into Cancer andNutrition (EPIC) including 530 incident invasive breast cancer cases, eachmatched to up to two control participants (n = 1036). Serum 27HC was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in blood samples collected atstudy recruitment. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were usedto quantify the association between circulating 27HC and breast cancer riskoverall, by tumor hormone receptor status (ie estrogen and progesteronereceptors), and by menopausal status at blood collection. All statistical testswere two-sided.Results: 27HC was not associated with breast cancer risk overall (relative risk[RR]Quartile4vsQuartile1 [Q4vsQ1] = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66 to 1.22). The association between 27HC and breast cancer risk differed by menopausalstatus at blood collection (Phet = .02), but not by age at diagnosis (Phet =.78). Among women who were postmenopausal at blood collection, higher serum 27HC levels were associated with lower breast cancer risk (RRQ4vsQ1 = 0.56, 95% CI =0.36 to 0.87). We observed no association between 27HC and breast cancer risk(RRQ4vsQ1 = 1.33, 95% CI = 0.75 to 2.38) among women who were premenopausal atblood collection.Conclusions: In this first prospective study, higher circulating 27HC wasassociated with lower risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.Identification of the first endogenous SERM associated with reduced risk ofinvasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women may offer novel avenues for breastcancer prevention strategies.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy115 PMID: 30016454
