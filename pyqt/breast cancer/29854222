DESIREE is a Europeanproject which aims at developing web-based services for the management of primarybreast cancer by multidisciplinary breast units (BUs). We describe theguideline-based decision support system (GL-DSS) of the project. Various breastcancer clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have been selected to be concurrently applied to provide state-of-the-art patient-specific recommendations. The aim is to reconcile CPG recommendations with the objective of complementarity to enlargethe number of clinical situations covered by the GL-DSS. Input and output dataexchange with the GL-DSS is performed using FHIR. We used a knowledge model ofthe domain as an ontology on which relies the reasoning process performed byrules that encode the selected CPGs. Semantic web tools were used, notably theEuler/EYE inference engine, to implement the GL-DSS. "Rainbow boxes" are asynthetic tabular display used to visualize the inferred recommendations.PMCID: PMC5977621PMID: 29854222
