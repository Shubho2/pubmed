The majority of TP53 gene alterations are missense substitutions,leading to expression of mutant forms of the p53 protein that are frequentlydetected at high levels in cancer cells. P53 mutants not only lose thephysiological tumor-suppressive activity of the wild-type p53 protein but alsoacquire novel powerful oncogenic functions, referred to as gain of function, thatmay actively confer a selective advantage during tumor progression. Some of thebest-characterized oncogenic activities of mutant p53 are mediated by its abilityto form aberrant protein complexes with other transcription factors or proteinsnot directly related to gene transcription. The set of cellular proteinsavailable to interact with mutant p53 is dependent on cell type and extensivelyaffected by environmental signals, so the prognostic impact of p53 mutation iscomplex. Specific functional interactions of mutant p53 can profoundly impacthomeostasis of breast cancer cells, reprogramming gene expression in response to specific extracellular inputs or cell-intrinsic conditions. The list of proteincomplexes involving mutant p53 in breast cancer is continuously growing, as isthe number of oncogenic phenotypes in which they could be involved. Inconsideration of the functional impact of such complexes, key interactions ofmutant p53 may be exploited as potential targets for development of therapiesaimed at defusing the oncogenic potential of p53 mutation.DOI: 10.2147/BCTT.S145826 PMCID: PMC6011883PMID: 29950894
