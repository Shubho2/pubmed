Mammary glandtumorigenesis and lung metastasis were monitored. Individual tumors were assessedfor proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, RhoA activation, and activation ofPyMT-dependent signaling pathways. Primary tumor cells from wild-type and Net1 KOmice were transplanted into the mammary glands of wild-type, nontumor-bearingmice, and tumor growth and metastasis were assessed. Gene expression in wild-typeand Net1 KO tumors was analyzed by gene ontology enrichment and for relativeactivation of gene expression signatures indicative of signaling pathwaysimportant for breast cancer initiation and progression. A gene expressionsignature indicative of Net1 function was identified. Human breast cancer geneexpression profiles were screened for the presence of a Net1 gene expressionsignature.RESULTS: We show that Net1 makes fundamental contributions to mammary glandtumorigenesis and metastasis. Net1 deletion delays tumorigenesis and stronglysuppresses metastasis in PyMT-expressing mice. Moreover, we observe that loss of Net1 reduces cancer cell proliferation, inhibits tumor angiogenesis, and promotestumor cell apoptosis. Net1 is required for maximal RhoA activation within tumors and for primary tumor cell motility. Furthermore, the ability of PyMT to initiateoncogenic signaling to ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt1 is inhibited by Net1 deletion.Primary tumor cell transplantation indicates that the reduction in tumorangiogenesis and lung metastasis observed upon Net1 deletion are tumor cellautonomous effects. Using a gene expression signature indicative of Net1activity, we show that Net1 signaling is activated in 10% of human breastcancers, and that this correlates with elevated proliferation and PI3K pathwayactivity. We also demonstrate that human breast cancer patients with a high Net1 gene expression signature experience shorter distant metastasis-free survival.CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that Net1 is required for tumor progression inthe PyMT mouse model and suggest that Net1 may contribute to breast cancerprogression in humans.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0966-2 PMCID: PMC5956559PMID: 29769144
