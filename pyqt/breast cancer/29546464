However, the underlying mechanisms of X chromosome aneuploidypromoting tumorigenesis remain obscure. We propose that chromosome-wide genedosage imbalance (CDI) may serve as an important mechanism. Here, we assess therelative expression ratios of X chromosome and autosomes (expression ratios ofX:AA) between tumor samples and adjacent normal samples across 16 tumor typesusing expression datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Ourresults show that the expression ratios of X:AA in tumor samples are frequentlyrebalanced to a lower level compared to those in adjacent normal samples, whichis termed chromosome-wide gene dosage rebalance (CDR) thereafter. Gene ontology(GO) analysis of differentially expression genes from X chromosome reveals thatdownregulation of multicellularity-related genes and upregulation ofunicellularity-related genes in tumors form a distinctive feature and enrichment analysis shows that downregulated genes are enriched in tumor suppressor genes,which indicate that CDR benefits tumor progression. Further experimental results prove that disturbance of X chromosome expression by knocking down of XIST inbreast cancer cells, which functions in initiation phase of X chromosomeinactivation (XCI), inhibits tumor progression. Our results demonstrate that the prevalent CDRs across tumor types serve as an important mechanism in promotingtumor progression, which partially explains the high risk of tumor in patientswith TS and also provides a new cancer therapy from the CDR perspective.DOI: 10.1007/s00438-018-1429-2 PMID: 29546464  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
