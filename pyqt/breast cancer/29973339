However, the direct relationship between tumour growth andimmune evasion can represent a general rule governing the pathological cancersystem from the initial cancer cells to when the system is entirely displayed.Accordingly, a refined pathobiological model and a novel therapeutic strategy areproposed. The novel therapeutic strategy is based on therapeutically inducedconditions (undetectable tumour burden and/or a prolonged tumour 'restingstate'), which enable an efficacious immune response in advanced breast and othertypes of solid cancers.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-18-0142 PMID: 29973339
