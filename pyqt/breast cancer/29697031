Colombia.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. N, N, N',N'-Tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine (TPEN) is a lipid-soluble zincmetal chelator that induces apoptosis in cancer cells through oxidative stress(OS). However, the effectiveness and the mechanisms involved in TPEN-induced celldeath in mammary adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo are still unclear.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of TPEN in mouseembryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, as normal control cells) and mammary adenocarcinoma cancer cells (TS/A cells) in vitro and in a mammary tumor model in vivo.METHODS: Cells were treated with TPEN (0-3 µM), and changes in nuclear chromatin and DNA, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and intracellular reactiveoxygen species (ROS) levels were determined by both fluorescence microscopy andflow cytometry. Cell proliferation and the cell cycle were also analyzed.Cellular markers of apoptosis were evaluated by Western blot. Finally, the effectof TPEN in a mammary adenocarcinoma tumor model in vivo was determined byimmunohistological analyses.RESULTS: TPEN induced apoptosis in TS/A cells in a dose-dependent manner,increasing nuclear chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, cell cycle arrestand ΔΨm loss. Additionally, TPEN increased dichlorofluorescein fluorescence(DCF+) intensity, indicative of ROS production; increased DJ-1-Cys106-sulfonateexpression, a marker of intracellular H2O2 stress; induced p53 and PUMAupregulation; and activated caspase-3. Moreover, TPEN induced mammary cancer cellelimination and tumor size reduction in vivo 48 h after treatment through anOS-induced apoptotic mechanism.CONCLUSION: TPEN selectively induces apoptosis in TS/A cells through anH2O2-mediated signaling pathway. Our findings support the use of TPEN as apotential treatment for breast cancer.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180426111520 PMID: 29697031
