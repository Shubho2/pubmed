We laser-captured microdissected single cells from morphologically distinct areas of primary breast cancer and corresponding lymph node metastasisand performed whole-exome or deep-target sequencing of more than 100 such cells. Two major subclones coexisted in different areas of the primary tumor, and thelymph node metastasis originated from a minor subclone in the invasive front ofthe primary tumor, with additional copy number changes, including chr8q gain, butno additional point mutations in driver genes. Lack of metastasis-specific driverevents led us to assess whether other clonal and subclonal genomic aberrationspreexisting in primary tumors contribute to lymph node metastasis. Gene mutationsand copy number variations analyzed in 5 breast cancer tissue sample setsrevealed that copy number variations in several genomic regions, including areas within chr1p, chr8q, chr9p, chr12q, and chr20q, harboring severalmetastasis-associated genes, were consistently associated with lymph nodemetastasis. Moreover, clonal expansion was observed in an area of morphologicallynormal breast epithelia, likely driven by a driver mutation and a subsequentamplification in chr1q. Our study illuminates the molecular evolution of breastcancer and genomic aberrations contributing to metastases.DOI: 10.1172/JCI97449 PMCID: PMC5983317 [Available on 2018-09-01]PMID: 29558370
