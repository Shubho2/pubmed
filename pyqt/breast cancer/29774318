This study is designed toinvestigate the Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) detection rate in breast cancer fordifferent biological characteristics.Material and Methods: Patients on whom we performed the methylene blue methodalone were named as Group I, radiocolloid substance method alone as Group II and both methylene blue and radiocolloid method as Group III. The results ofbiological tumor characteristics and characteristics of the patients on differentSLN biopsy techniques were investigated.Results: The overall SLN detecting success rate was 83.3%. When considered foreach group, success rate was 80% for group I, 84.9% for group II and 90.6% forgroup III. While a success rate of 94.6% was achieved with radiocolloid only inthe patients in Luminal A and B subgroup, 90% success rate was achieved in Her2(+) and triple negative (TN) patients with combined method.Conclusion: While successful results could be achieved by using radiocolloidsubstances alone in patients with Luminal A and B subtypes, combined methodsshould be used in HER2 (+) and TN patients.DOI: 10.5152/ejbh.2018.3780 PMCID: PMC5939972PMID: 29774318
