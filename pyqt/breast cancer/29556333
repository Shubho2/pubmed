In thisstudy, we assessed HES1 expression in breast cancer tissues usingimmunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses and investigated HES1 functionusing MTT and Matrigel invasion assays. Significant relationships were observedbetween HES1 upregulation and advanced TNM stage (p=0.011), node metastasis(p=0.043), negative oestrogen receptor expression (p=0.001) and triple-negativestatus (p=0.001). HES1 overexpression was correlated with poor prognosis inbreast cancer patients (p<0.05). The MTT and Matrigel invasion assays showed thatsilencing HES1 in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased cell proliferation and invasion,whereas overexpression of HES1 in MCF-7 cells enhanced its proliferation andinvasion. Further analyses showed that silencing HES1 downregulated p-AKT andimpeded epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas overexpression of HES1upregulated AKT phosphorylation and induced EMT. Our study demonstrated that HES1upregulation is a predictor of poor prognosis in human breast cancers and mightbe a critical contributor to the proliferation and invasion of breast cancercells. Moreover, the proportion of cells with overexpression of HES1 intriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) samples was significantly higher. Thus, HES1might be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of TNBC.DOI: 10.7150/jca.22319 PMCID: PMC5858497PMID: 29556333
