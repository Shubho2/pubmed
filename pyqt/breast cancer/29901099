China.Bigelovii A is a 30‑nortriterpenoid glycoside, isolated from Salicornia bigeloviiTorr. Until now, the effect of Bigelovii A on breast cancer treatment wasunknown. The present research indicated that Bigelovii A significantly inhibited the proliferation of human breast cancer cells (MCF‑7, MDA‑MB‑231 and MDA‑MB‑468)in a concentration‑dependent manner. It was particularly effective in MCF7 cells,with an IC50 value of 4.10±1.19 µM. The anti‑proliferative effect of Bigelovii A was ascribed to the induction of apoptosis, which was characterized by chromatin condensation, externalization of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane,hypodiploid DNA, activation of caspases and poly (ADP‑ribose) polymerasecleavage. Furthermore, Bigelovii A reduced B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) and B‑celllymphoma‑extra large (Bcl‑xl) expression and caused disruption of mitochondrialmembrane potential, which are indicative features of mitochondria‑dependentapoptotic signals. It was also identified that Bigelovii A downregulated theconstitutive activation of nuclear factor (NF)‑κB, as indicated by theelectrophoretic mobility gel shift assay and immunocytochemistry. Furthermore,Bigelovii A suppressed constitutive IκBα phosphorylation via inhibition of IκBkinase activity. In addition to the effects on Bcl‑2 and Bcl‑xl, Bigelovii A alsodownregulated the expression of the NF‑κB‑regulated gene products, Cyclin D1 and cyclooxygenase‑2. This led to the induction of apoptosis and arrest of cells atthe G1 phase of the cell cycle.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9104 PMCID: PMC6072195PMID: 29901099
