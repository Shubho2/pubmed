Theoutcomes of cancer treatment depend, to a considerable extent, on the degree ofacceptance of the illness. The objective of the study was determination of thelevel of acceptance of the disease among the examined women with breast cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study covered a group of 231 women who receivedtreatment for breast cancer in the Rev. Bronislaw Markiewicz SubcarpathianOncology Centre in Brzozow, south-eastern Poland, and conducted by the method of a diagnostic survey, using an author constructed questionnaire and the standardAcceptance of Illness Scale, adapted by Z. Juczyński. Statistical analyses wereperformed using the software IBM SPSS v. 21.0.0.1. The p values p≤0.05 wereconsidered statistically significant.RESULTS: The mean level of acceptance of the illness in the examined group ofwomen was 26.53 (SD = 7.71; Me = 26). The largest number of respondents (50.6%)obtained scores within the range of 20-29, according to the AIS Scale. From amongthe adopted variables, the level of acceptance of the illness significantlyvaried according to age and occupational activity. However, no such differenceswere confirmed according to the place of residence, marital status, educationlevel, or the type of occupation performed.CONCLUSIONS: In the examined group of women, a mediocre level of acceptance ofcancer was observed. The respondents' age and occupational situation exerted asignificant effect on the level of acceptance of the illness. The results of the study should be considered as satisfactory because the number of women with ahigh level of acceptance of breast cancer was more than twice as high as thoseones with a low acceptance of the disease.DOI: 10.26444/aaem/75876 PMID: 29575856  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
