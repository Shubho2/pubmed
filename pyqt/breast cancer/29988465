Here, we describe a novel, chimericorthopoxvirus (CF33) that efficiently kills TNBC. Cytotoxicity was assayedin vitro in four TNBC cell lines. Viral replication was examined through standardplaque assay. Two orthotopic TNBC xenograft models were generated in athymic nudemice and were injected with CF33 intratumorally. CF33 was effective in vitro withpotent cytotoxicity and efficient intracellular replication observed in TNBClines with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway mutations thatresulted in endogenous phospho-Akt (p-Akt) activity (BT549, Hs578T, andMDA-MB-468). Relative resistance to CF33 by wild-type PI3K/Akt pathway cell line MDA-MB-231 was overcome using higher MOI. The virus was effective in vivo withsignificant tumor size reduction in both xenograft models. Mechanistically, CF33 appears to share similar properties to vaccinia virus with respect toAkt-mediated and low-pH-mediated viral entry. In summary, CF33 demonstratedpotent antitumoral effect in vitro and in vivo, with the most potent effectpredicted by the presence of endogenous Akt activity in the TNBC cell line.Further investigation of its mechanism of action as well as genetic modificationsto enhance its natural viral tropism are warranted for preclinical development.DOI: 10.1016/j.omto.2018.04.001 PMCID: PMC6026447PMID: 29988465
