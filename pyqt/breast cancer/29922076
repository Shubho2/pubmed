However, the clinical and prognostic values of SYK in solid tumors remain unclear. This meta-analysisinvestigated the association between SYK expression and clinical outcomes in the patients with solid tumors.Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted by screening the online electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, and the China National KnowledgeInfrastructure. The hazard ratio (HR) with its corresponding 95% CI was used toexplore the prognostic value of SYK.Results: We analyzed a total of 1,075 patients from 10 studies, which met thecriteria for this meta-analysis. Our pooled results demonstrated that a lowexpression of SYK did not correlate significantly with shorter overall survival(OS; HR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.34-1.21, P=0.169) or poorer disease-free survival(HR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.13-2.02, P=0.338). However, in a subgroup analysis based ontumor type and test method, under-expression of SYK was positively associatedwith worse OS in the groups of breast cancer (BC; HR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.32-0.80,P=0.003), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; HR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.29-0.69, P<0.001),methylation (HR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.30-0.51, P<0.001), and quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (HR=0.24, 95% CI: 0.09-0.65, P=0.005).Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrated that under-expression of SYK mayserve as a predictive biomarker for poor prognosis in BC and HCC patients. Inother solid tumors, the clinical usefulness should be confirmed by large-scalestudies.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S163136 PMCID: PMC5996858PMID: 29922076
