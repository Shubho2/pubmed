Unbound brain (Cb,u), unbound plasma (Cp,u), and CSF compoundconcentrations (CCSF) were measured in rats and nonhuman primates (NHPs), and theunbound partition coefficients (Cb,u/Cp,u and CCSF/Cp,u) were used to assessbrain penetration. The results indicated that for P-gp and BCRP dual substrates, brain penetration was severally impaired in all species. In comparison, for P-gp substrates that are weak or non-BCRP substrates, improved brain penetration wasobserved in NHPs and humans than in rats. Overall, NHP appears to be morepredictive of human brain penetration for P-gp substrates with weak or nointeraction with BCRP than rat. Although CCSF does not quantitatively correspond to Cb,u for efflux transporter substrates, it is mostly within 3-fold higher ofCb,u in rat and NHP, suggesting that CCSF can be used as a surrogate for Cb,u.Taken together, a holistic approach including both in vitro transporter andin vivo neuropharmacokinetics data enables a better estimation of human brainpenetration of P-gp/BCRP substrates.Copyright © 2018 American Pharmacists Association®.
