The specific aims of this study are to reportmorpho-immunohistological characteristics of breast tumours with Oncotype DX®(ODx) recurrence scores (RS) of 10 or fewer (ultra-low risk) and 25 or fewer (lowrisk) in order to determine if pathologists can identify prospectively patienttumours that do not require ODx testing.METHODS AND RESULTS: Oncotype DX® cases with RS < 10 from 2005 to 2010 comprised 441 of 2594 (17%) of clinical cases; this cohort had 5 years' follow-up and wastreated with endocrine therapy alone. Tumours were analysed for tumour type,Nottingham grade, mitosis score (MS) semi-quantitative (H-score) hormone receptorcontent and Magee equation 3. Knowledge derived from this data set was used todevelop algorithms in order to identify prospectively tumours with RS of 10 orfewer or 25 or fewer. Thirty-four per cent of tumours were low-grade specialtypes, while the remainder were enriched with high hormone receptor content with MS of 1. These algorithmic selection criteria identified correctly all patientcases below the chemotherapy cut-point, i.e. RS < 25, indicating that theseoncotype test orders were an unnecessary cost.CONCLUSIONS: This unique study demonstrates that (i) pathologists add great valueto triage breast cancer for GEPT; and (ii) can identify prospectively low-gradetumour biology with high sensitivity and high specificity for those cases whichdo not require chemotherapy (RS < 25) using MS and hormone receptor content.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/his.13690 PMID: 29920746
