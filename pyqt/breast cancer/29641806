Data from the Hairdex Questionnaire was used to assess the impact ofthe alopecia on patients QoL. Higher score indicates lower QoL (0-100 score).Efficacy of minoxidil was measured at 3 or 6 months by a single-blindedinvestigator through standardized clinical photographs of the scalp.Results: A total of 112 female patients with breast cancer were included (median [range] age, 60 [34-90] years). A total of 104 patients (93%) had standardizedclinical photographs; of these, 59 patients (53%) had trichoscopy imagesavailable at baseline, and 46 patients (41%) were assessed for response tominoxidil. Alopecia was attributed to aromatase inhibitors in 75 patients (67%)and tamoxifen in 37 (33%). Severity was grade 1 in 96 of 104 patients (92%), and the pattern was similar to androgenetic alopecia. The predominant trichoscopicfeature at baseline was the presence of vellus hairs and intermediate- andthick-diameter terminal hair shafts. A negative impact on QoL was reported, with a higher effect in the emotion domain according to the Hairdex score (mean [SD], 41.8 [21.3]; P < .001). After treatment with topical minoxidil, moderate orsignificant improvement in alopecia was observed in 37 of 46 patients (80%).Conclusions and Relevance: Endocrine therapies are associated with a patternalopecia similar to androgenetic-type, consistent with the mechanism of action ofcausal agents. A significant negative impact on QoL was reported by patients,despite mostly mild alopecia severity.DOI: 10.1001/jamadermatol.2018.0454 PMID: 29641806
