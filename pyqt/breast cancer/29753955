Findings were pooled by using combined effect models andhierarchic summary receiver operating characteristic curve models.Meta-regression analysis and threshold effect evaluating were performed toexplore the sources of heterogeneity affected classification accuracy.RESULTS: 19 studies (803 positive and 4594 negative lymph nodes) were analyzed,including 4 different tumor types (head and neck cancers, gastrointestinalcancers, lung cancer and gynecological malignancies). In the studies of head and neck cancers the pooled sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC)of the OSNA method were 0.85(0.79-0.89), 0.96(0.92-0.98) and 0.91 (0.88-0.93),respectively. Similarly, the corresponding values in the studies ofgastrointestinal cancers were 0.90(0.85-0.94), 0.96(0.94-0.98) and 0.97(0.96-0.99), respectively. Because of limited number of studies, the other twotumor types were inestimable in the subsequent meta-analyses.CONCLUSIONS: Pooled data suggest that the OSNA assay has a high diagnosticaccuracy for the detection of lymph node metastases. For wide spreadimplementation, additional studies on other different types of tumors arewarranted.Copyright Â© 2018 IJS Publishing Group Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
