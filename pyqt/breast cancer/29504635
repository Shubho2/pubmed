Epub 2018 Mar 5.Upregulation of nitric oxide in tumor cells as a negative adaptation tophotodynamic therapy.Girotti AW(1).Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee,Wisconsin.One of the advantages of PDT is that it can often circumvent tumor resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin and doxorubicin. However, pre-existing and acquired resistance to PDT has also been demonstrated. One type ofresistance, which involves nitric oxide (NO) generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) in tumor cells, was discovered in the author's laboratory.When subjected to a 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-based photodynamic challenge,several cancer lines, including breast, prostate, and glioma, underwent intrinsicapoptosis that could be substantially enhanced by iNOS enzymatic inhibitors or a NO scavenger, implying iNOS/NO-mediated resistance. In most cases, iNOS wassignificantly upregulated by the challenge and this appeared to be more importantin the hyper-resistance than pre-existing enzyme. Of added importance was ourobservation that cells surviving ALA/light treatment typically exhibited a moreaggressive phenotype, proliferating and migrating/invading more rapidly thancontrols in iNOS/NO-dependent fashion. Most of these in vitro PDT findings haverecently been confirmed at the in vivo level, using a human breast tumorxenograft model. We have also shown that upregulated iNOS in PDT-targeted cellscan elicit a pro-growth/migration response in non-targeted bystander cells, NOagain playing a key role. Post-PDT resistance and potentially dangeroushyper-aggressiveness can be attenuated by inhibitors of iNOS enzymatic activity, some of which have seen pharmacologic use in non-cancer or PDT settings. Thesevarious aspects of PDT antagonism by tumor iNOS/NO and how they might be overcomewill be discussed in this review. Lasers Surg.
