Epub2018 Apr 6.A qualitative exploration of the meaning of the term "survivor" to young womenliving with a history of breast cancer.Rees S(1).Author information: (1)Division of Health Sciences, Warwick Medical School, Coventry, UK.There has been a recent increase in research considering the perceptions of theterm "cancer survivor" held by individuals who have or have had cancer. Thisarticle explores the meaning of the term to young women living with a history of breast cancer. Twenty women participated in semi-structured interviews abouttheir experience of breast cancer. The methodology was informed by socialconstructionist grounded theory. Three of the women interviewed said they woulduse the term survivor to describe themselves, but most of the women felt it didnot fit with their experiences. The accounts of those who accepted and rejectedthe survivor identity are explored, and subthemes in the latter are "survivor as somebody else" and "cancer's ongoing presence." This article calls into question the basing of intervention strategies on the notion of the "cancer survivor," andthe assumption that younger women favour the survivor identity. Participantsstruggled with the demand to live up to the ideal of the survivor, which implied a high degree of agency where in reality, cancer was a disempowering experience. Being labelled a survivor obscured ongoing impacts of cancer on the young women'slives.Â© 2018 The Author.
