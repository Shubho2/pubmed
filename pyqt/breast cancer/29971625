We aimed to investigate whether the basal HER2 subtypeof breast cancer has distinguished characteristics.METHODS: We performed a substudy by using data from a retrospectivemulti-institutional cohort of JBCRG-C03. Between 2001 and 2011, we identified 184eligible patients who received concurrent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) withtrastuzumab for hormone receptor-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer. Wedefined basal HER2 subtype breast cancer as HER2-positive, ER/PgR-negative, andbasal markers (EGFR, CK14 or CK5/6) positive by immunohistochemistricalevaluation. The pathologic complete response (pCR) and disease-free survival(DFS) rates were compared between the two subtypes.RESULTS: A total of 127 (69.0%) patients achieved pCR after NAC and 29 (15.8%)patients experienced events of DFS within a 42 month median follow-up period(interquartile range 26-58 months). Although the basal HER2 subtype was relatedwith poor DFS (3 year DFS: non-basal HER2, 95.0%; basal HER2, 86.9%; adjusted HR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2-14.5), neither the subtype (pCR: non-basal HER2, 75%; basal HER2,66.7%; adjusted OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.27-1.28) nor the degree of expression of basal markers was significantly related with the pCR rate.CONCLUSION: Basal HER2 phenotype showed poor DFS, but equivalent pCR rate afterconcurrent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab. A different treatmentapproach to basal-HER2 type is needed even for cases that achieved adequateclinical response after NAC.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4873-0 PMID: 29971625
