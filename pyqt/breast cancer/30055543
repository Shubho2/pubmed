Nanotechnology has been providing promising tools forchemotherapy especially in cancer treatment. Nanotechnology deals with physicaland biochemical properties of nanoparticles in the clinical application of drugs.Targeted nanoparticle drug delivery is intended to reduce the side effects ofanticancer drugs with both decreases in consumption and treatment expenses, whichare the major hurdles in conventional cancer treatment. The characteristic small size and special coating of nanoparticles facilitates the delivery of hydrophobicanticancer drugs to specific sites with reduced opsonization by defensemechanisms of the body. One of the vast applications of nanotechnology is thediagnosis, treatment, and prevention of breast cancers. Breast cancer isassociated with high morbidity and mortality and is the second leading cause ofdeath in Western countries. A large number of nanoparticles have been developed, specifically targeting metastasized tumors of the breast. The present reviewfocuses on the application of different types of nanoparticles including gold,polymeric, and magnetic nanoparticles in the treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2018022771 PMID: 30055543
