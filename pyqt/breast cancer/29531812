Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is an important therapeutictarget to prevent stress responses in chronic inflammatory diseases includingcancer. However, whether E2 activates NF-κB to participate in stress-associatedapoptosis in E2-deprived breast cancer cells is unknown. Here, we demonstratedthat E2 differentially modulates NF-κB activity according to treatment time. E2initially has significant potential to suppress NF-κB activation; it completelyblocks tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-induced activation of NF-κB. We foundthat E2 preferentially and constantly enhances the expression of the adipogenictranscription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ), which isresponsible for the suppression of NF-κB activation by E2 in MCF-7:5C cells.Interestingly, NF-κB p65 DNA-binding activity is increased when E2 isadministered for 48 h, leading to the induction of TNFα and associated apoptosis.Blocking the nuclear translocation of NF-κB can completely prevent the induction of TNFα and apoptosis induced by E2. Further examination revealed that proteinkinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), a stress sensor of unfolded protein response (UPR), plays an essential role in the late activation of NF-κBby E2. This modulation between PERK and NF-κB is mainly mediated by a stressresponsive transcription factor, transducer and activator of transcription 3(STAT3), independently of the classic canonical IκBα signaling pathway. Thus,inhibition of PERK kinase activity completely blocks the DNA binding of bothSTAT3 and NF-κB, thereby preventing induction of NF-κB-dependent genes andE2-induced apoptosis. All of these findings suggest that PERK is a key regulator to convey stress signals from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus andillustrate a crucial role for the novel PERK/STAT3/NF-κB/TNFα axis in E2-induced apoptosis in E2-deprived breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1038/s41420-017-0012-7 PMCID: PMC5841410PMID: 29531812
