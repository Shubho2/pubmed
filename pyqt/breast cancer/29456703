China.The present study was designed to explore the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to cisplatin after silencing the expression of TG-interacting factor (TGIF) protein.Cell viability was measured using an MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was detected bythe annexin V and dead cell assay and the Hoechst staining assay. Proteinexpression was analyzed using western blot analysis. A colony formation assay wasalso performed. It was observed that cisplatin reduced the expression of TGIFprotein in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Silencing TGIF significantlysuppressed the cell proliferation and colony formation in MDA-MB-231 cells withthe treatment of cisplatin. Results indicated that silencing TGIF coulddramatically increase the cisplatin-induced apoptosis rate in MDA-MB-231 cells.The expression of PARP and caspase-3 proteins was correlated with the effect thatsilencing TGIF enhanced cisplatin sensitivity in MDA-MB-231 cells. The presentdata showed that silencing TGIF promoted apoptotic sensitivity that was inducedby cisplatin in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and suggested that TGIFmight be a therapeutic target for improving the chemotherapy response intriple-negative breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2018.5780 PMCID: PMC5795508PMID: 29456703
