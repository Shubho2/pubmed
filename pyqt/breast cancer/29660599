As survival rate increases,managing tamoxifen ocular toxicities is important for patients' quality of life. Macular pigments in photoreceptor cells protect against free radical damage,which can cause macular degeneration. By reducing macular pigment concentration, tamoxifen may increase the risk of macular degeneration. Here, we comparedmacular pigment optical density (MPOD) and central macular thickness betweenbreast cancer patients on tamoxifen adjuvant therapy (n = 70), and a controlgroup (n = 72). Multiple regression analysis indicated that MPOD decreases withincreasing tamoxifen dosage, up to a threshold of about 20 g, after which MPODplateaus out. Mean MPOD in the treatment group (mean = 0.40) was significantlylower (p-value = 0.02) compared to the control group (mean = 0.47) for the lefteye, and for the right eye (treatment mean = 0.39; control mean = 0.48;p-value = 0.009). No significant difference in mean central macular thickness wasfound between the treatment and the control group (p-values > 0.4). In thecontrol group, MPOD and central macular thickness showed significant correlation (r∼0.30; p-values < 0.01) for both eyes. However, in the treatment group, loss ofsignificant correlation was observed in the left eye (r = 0.21; p-value = 0.08). The present results show that MPOD decreases non-linearly as a function oftamoxifen dosage, and highlight the potential of tamoxifen to reduce macularpigment concentration through an unknown mechanism that does not depend onmacular thinning solely.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
