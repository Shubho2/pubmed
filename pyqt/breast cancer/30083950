Given thatBlack women have a higher incidence of early-onset breast cancers than Whitewomen, we hypothesized that milk of the former contains higher levels ofpro-inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, and growth factors.METHODS: Participants included 130 Black and 162 White women without a history ofa breast biopsy who completed a health assessment questionnaire and donated milk for research. Concentrations of 15 analytes in milk were examined using twomultiplex and 4 single-analyte electrochemiluminescent sandwich assays to measurepro-inflammatory cytokines, angiogenesis factors, and adipokines. Mixed-effectsordinal logistic regression was used to identify determinants of analyte levelsand to compare results by race, with adjustment for confounders. Factor analysis was used to examine covariation among analytes.RESULTS: Thirteen of 15 analytes were detected in ≥ 25% of the human milkspecimens. In multivariable models, elevated BMI was significantly associatedwith increased concentrations of 5 cytokines: IL-1β, bFGF, FASL, EGF, and leptin (all p-trend < 0.05). Black women had significantly higher levels of leptin andIL-1β, controlling for BMI. Factor analysis of analyte levels identified twofactors related to inflammation and growth factor pathways.CONCLUSION: This exploratory study demonstrated the feasibility of measuringpro-inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, and angiogenesis factors in human milk,and revealed higher levels of some pro-inflammatory factors, as well as increasedleptin levels, among Black as compared with White women.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4907-7 PMID: 30083950
