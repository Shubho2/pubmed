[Epub ahead of print]A prospective and population-based inquiry on the use and acceptability of peersupport for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer.Legg M(1)(2), Hyde MK(3)(4), Occhipinti S(3), Youl PH(3)(5)(6), DunnJ(3)(4)(7)(8), Chambers SK(3)(4)(7)(9)(10).Author information: (1)Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus,Southport, Queensland, 4222, Australia. m.legg@griffith.edu.au.(2)Cancer Research Centre, Cancer Council Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.m.legg@griffith.edu.au.(3)Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus,Southport, Queensland, 4222, Australia.(4)Cancer Research Centre, Cancer Council Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.(5)School of Public Health and Social Work, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.(6)University of the Sunshine Coast, Sippy Downs, Australia.(7)Institute for Resilient Regions, University of Southern Queensland,Springfield, Australia.(8)School of Social Science, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.(9)Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, Sydney, Australia.(10)Health and Wellness Institute, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia.The degree to which peer support is used and accepted as a supportive careapproach by women with breast cancer is unclear. We examine peer support useacross three major modalities (i.e. support groups, online platforms, one-on-one)and identify enablers and barriers to peer support using the beliefs framework ofthe theory of planned behaviour. A population-based sample of women newlydiagnosed with breast cancer (n = 3105) who were on average 54.08 weeks sincediagnosis completed mailed surveys at baseline measuring beliefs about peersupport and intention. Peer support use was measured via telephone interview atbaseline and prospectively at 12-month follow-up (n = 2780). In all, 37% of womenhad used at least one peer support service since diagnosis (support group = 20%, online = 18%, one-on-one = 10%). A path analysis examined what beliefs enabled oracted as barriers to peer support use at follow-up adjusting for past behaviour(i.e. baseline use), sociodemographic characteristics, and treatment. In order ofrelative strength, enablers included beliefs that peer support is an outlet forhonest expression of feelings (β = .35), a source of empathy (β = .30), approved by doctors (β = .07), and approved by family/partner (β = .04). Barriers werebeliefs that it encourages dwelling about breast cancer (β = - .06) and involves exposure to negative stories about this disease (β = - .04). Strategies whichcommunicate the potential emotional support benefits of a shared illnessexperience and social approval by others, particularly the medical profession,may help to promote acceptance of peer support and encourage service uptake inbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4358-z PMID: 30056530
