Docetaxel (T), carboplatin (C), H, andpertuzumab (P) have immune-modulating effects. Pre- and post-treatment immunebiomarkers in cancers treated with neoadjuvant TCH with or without P are lacking.In this study we quantified baseline and changes in TILs, cluster ofdifferentiation (CD) 4+, CD8+, FoxP3+, and PD-L1+ cells usingimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantified productive T-cell receptor β (TCRβ)rearrangements and TCRβ clonality using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 30HER2+ breast cancer tissues treated with neoadjuvant H with or without Pregimens.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty pre- and post-neoadjuvant TCH (n = 4) or TCHP (n = 26) breast cancer tissues were identified. TILs were quantified manually usinghematoxylin and eosin. CD4, CD8, FoxP3, and PD-L1 were stained using IHC. TCRβwas evaluated using NGS. Immune infiltrates were compared between pCR and non-pCRgroups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.RESULTS: A pCR occurred in 15 (n = 15; 50%) cancers (TCH n = 2; TCHP, n = 13).Pretreatment TILs, CD4+, CD8+, FoxP3+, and PD-L1+ cells were not associated with response (P = .42, P = .55, P = .19, P = .66, P = .87, respectively. Pretreatmentproductive TCRβ and TCRβ clonality did not predict response, P = .84 and P = .40,respectively). However, post-treatment CD4+ and FoxP3+ cells (T-regulatory cells)were elevated in the non-pCR cohort (P = .042 and P = .082, respectively).CONCLUSION: An increase in regulatory T cells in non-pCR tissues suggests thedevelopment of an immunosuppressive phenotype. Further investigation in a larger cohort of samples is warranted to validate these findings.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.02.010 PMID: 29615305
