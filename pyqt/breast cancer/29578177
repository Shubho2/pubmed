However, the results of clinicalstudies remain controversial. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate theefficacy and safety of ErbB (mainly epidermal growth factor receptor and humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) inhibitors added to ET for hormonereceptor-positive breast cancer patients.Materials and Methods: Eligible randomized clinical trials on ET with or without ErbB receptor-targeting inhibitors (ERTI) for hormone receptor-positive breastcancer were identified by searching the main electronic databases (up to July2015). Revman 5.3 was used to analyze the outcomes extracted from the includedtrials.Results: In the overall population, ERTI failed to show any significantdifferences on overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), andoverall survival (OS). However, improvement on progression-free survival (PFS)(hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76-0.93, P = 0.0005)was observed. For the HER2+ subgroup, ERTI could significantly improve ORR, CBR, PFS, OS, and time to progression compared to endocrine monotherapy. Thisimprovement cannot be found in the HER2- subgroup. The risk of serious adverseevents (SAEs) increased significantly when ERTI was present (RR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.44-3.02, P < 0.0001).Conclusions: For HR+/HER2+ breast cancer, ERTI added to ET can significantlyimprove the clinical efficacy with the cost of increasing SAE.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.183190 PMID: 29578177
