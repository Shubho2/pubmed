Human urine represents a useful resource ofmetabolites for biomarker discovery, because it could reflect metabolicalterations caused by a particular pathological state. Furthermore, urineanalysis is readily available, it is non-invasive and allows in-time monitoring. Therefore, in present study, a metabolic- and lipid fingerprinting of urine wasperformed using an analytical multiplatform approach. The study was conducted in order to identify alterated metabolites which can be helpful in the understandingof metabolic alterations driven by BC as well as their potential usage asbiomarkers. Urine samples collected from healthy controls and BC subjects wereanalyzed using LC-MS and GC-MS. Subsequently, significantly altered metaboliteswere determined by employing univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Anoverall decrease of intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and metabolitesbelonging to amino acids and nucleotides were observed, along with an incrementof lipid-related compounds. Receiver operating characteristic analysis evaluated the combination of dimethylheptanoylcarnitine and succinic acid as potentialurinary markers, achieving a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 86%. Thepresent analytical multiplatform approach enabled a wide coverage of urinemetabolites that revealed significant alterations in BC samples, demonstratingits usefulness for biomarker discovery in selected populations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
