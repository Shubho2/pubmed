Commercial analysisof the BRCA1/2 genes has been available since 1996, and testing for hereditarybreast and ovarian cancer syndrome is well established. The NationalComprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines identify individuals for whomBRCA1/2 analysis is appropriate and define management recommendations formutation carriers. Despite recommendations, not all who meet NCCN criteriaundergo genetic testing. We assess the frequency that individuals meeting NCCNcriteria decline BRCA1/2 analysis, as well as factors that affect thedecision-making process. A retrospective chart review was performed fromSeptember 2013 through August 2014 of individuals who received genetic counselingat the Levine Cancer Institute. A total of 1082 individuals identified throughthe retrospective chart review met NCCN criteria for BRCA1/2 analysis. Of these, 267 (24.7%) did not pursue genetic testing. Of the Nontested cohort, 59 (22.1%)were disinterested in testing and 108 (40.4%) were advised to gather additionalgenetic or medical information about their relatives before testing. Theremaining 100 (37.5%) individuals were insured and desired to undergo genetictesting but were prohibited by the expense. Eighty five of these 100 patientswere responsible for the total cost of the test, whereas the remaining 15 faced aprohibitive copay expense. Financial concerns are a major deterrent to thepursuit of BRCA1/2 analysis among those who meet NCNN criteria, especially inpatients diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer. These findings highlight theneed to address financial concerns for genetic testing in this high-riskpopulation.PMID: 29428045  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
