Print 2018.Synthesis and Cytotoxic Evaluation of1H-1,2,3-Triazol-1-ylmethyl-2,3-dihydronaphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-diones.Chipoline IC(1), Alves E(2), Branco P(2), Costa-Lotufo LV(2), Ferreira VF(3),Silva FCD(1).Author information: (1)Departamento de Química, Instituto de Química Orgânica, Universidade FederalFluminense, Niterói, RJ, Brazil.(2)Departamento de Farmacologia, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP,Brazil.(3)Departamento de Tecnologia Farmacêutica, Faculdade de Farmácia, UniversidadeFederal Fluminense, Niterói, RJ, Brazil.The 1,2-naphthoquinone compound was previously considered active against solidtumors. Moreover, glycosidase inhibitors such as 1,2,3-1H triazoles has beenpointed out as efficient compounds in anticancer activity studies. Thus, a seriesof eleven 1,2-naphthoquinones tethered in C2 to 1,2,3-1H-triazoles 9a-k weredesigned, synthesized and their cytotoxic activity evaluated using HCT-116 (colonadenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) and RPE (human nontumor cell line from retinal epithelium). The chemical synthesis was performed from C-3allylation of lawsone followed by iodocyclization with subsequent nucleophilicdisplacement with sodium azide and, finally, the 1,3-dipolar cycloadditioncatalyzed by Cu(I) with terminal alkynes led to the formation of1H-1,2,3-Triazol-1-ylmethyl-2,3-dihydronaphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-diones in goodyields. Compounds containing aromatic group linked to 1,2,3-triazole ring (9c,9d, 9e, 9i) presented superior cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines with IC50 in the range of 0.74 to 4.4 µM indicating that the presence of aromaticrings substituents in the 1,2,3-1H-triazole moiety is probably responsible forthe improved cytotoxic activity.DOI: 10.1590/0001-3765201820170698 PMID: 29451602
