Materials and MethodsFrom March 2009 to February 2013, 1802 patients who underwent breast-conservingsurgery for clinical T1-2/N0 cancers and SLN biopsy with or without axillarylymph node dissection were included. Preoperative axillary US results andclinical-pathologic variables were compared according to the status of non-SLNmetastasis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to findfactors associated with non-SLN metastasis. Results Of 1802 patients, 397 (22.0%)underwent axillary lymph node dissection due to positive SLN biopsy and 76 (4.2%)had non-SLN metastasis at final histopathologic examination. Patients withnon-SLN metastasis were younger and showed positive axilla at US and clinical T2 stage more frequently (P < .05). At multivariate analysis, positive axilla at US (P = .001), clinical T2 stage (P = .005), and lymphovascular invasion (P < .001) were significantly associated with non-SLN metastasis. Among 1284 patients withnegative axilla at US and clinical T1 stage cancer, 1254 (97.7%) did not havenon-SLN metastasis and 30 (2.3%) had non-SLN metastasis. Conclusion Preoperative axillary US results and clinical T stage are associated with the status ofnon-SLN metastasis in patients with early breast cancer. The results of thisstudy suggest that preoperative axillary US can help select patients at minimalrisk of non-SLN metastasis, for whom axillary lymph node dissection can beomitted.
