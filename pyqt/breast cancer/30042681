As metabolism is the key factor in altering cellular estrogens, thereby influencing breast tumor growth, we investigated the effects of RES on the formation of estrogen metabolites, namely4-androstene-3,17-dione (AD), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),dehydroepiandrosterone-3-O-sulfate (DHEA-S), estrone (E1), estrone-3-sulfate(E1-S), 17β-estradiol (E2), 17β-estradiol-3-O-(β-D-glucuronide) (E2-G),17β-estradiol-3-O-sulfate (E2-S), 16α-hydroxy-17β-estradiol (estriol, E3), andtestosterone (T) in ERα- MDA-MB-231 and ERα+ MCF-7 cells. Incubation of both ofthe cell lines with the hormone precursors DHEA and E1 revealed that sulfationand glucuronidation were preferred metabolic pathways for DHEA, E1 and E2 inMCF-7 cells, compared with in MDA-MB-231 cells, as the Vmax values weresignificantly higher (DHEA-S: 2873.0 ± 327.4 fmol/106 cells/h, E1-S: 30.4 ± 2.5fmol/106 cells/h, E2-S: 24.7 ± 4.9 fmol/106 cells/h, E2-G: 7.29 ± 1.36 fmol/106cells/h). RES therefore significantly inhibited DHEA-S, E1-S, E2-S and E2-Gformation in MCF-7, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells (Kis: E2-S, 0.73 ± 0.07 μM <E1-S, 0.94 ± 0.03 μM < E2-G, 7.92 ± 0.24 μM < DHEA-S, 13.2 ± 0.2 μM). Suppressionof these metabolites subsequently revealed twofold higher levels of active E2,concomitant with an almost twofold increase in MCF-7 cell proliferation, whichwas the most pronounced upon the addition of 5 μM RES. As the content of RES infood is relatively low, an increased risk of breast cancer progression in womenis likely to only be observed following the continuous consumption of high-doseRES supplements. Further long-term human studies simultaneously monitoring freeestrogens and their conjugates are therefore highly warranted to evaluate theefficacy and safety of RES supplementation, particularly in patients diagnosedwith ERα+ breast cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00742 PMCID: PMC6048268PMID: 30042681
