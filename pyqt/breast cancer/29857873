Breast MRI forms the gold standard but is moreburdensome, time consuming and costly. In this study response measurement wasdone with 3-D ultrasound by Automated Breast Volume Scanner (ABVS) and comparedto breast MRI. Moreover, patient satisfaction with both techniques was compared.METHODS AND MATERIALS: A single-institution, prospective observational pilotstudy evaluating tumour response by ABVS in addition to breast MRI (standardcare) was performed in 25 invasive breast cancer patients receiving NAC. Tumourresponse was evaluated comparing longest tumour diameters as well as tumourvolumes at predefined time points using Bland-Altman analysis. Volumemeasurements for breast MRI were obtained using a fully immersive virtual realitysystem (a Barco I-Space) and V-Scope software. Same software was used to obtainABVS volume measurements using an in-house developed desktop VR system. Inter-and intra-observer agreement was evaluated by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC).RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were eligible for baseline measurement, 20 for amid-NAC response evaluation, and five for a post-NAC response evaluation. MRI andABVS showed absolute concordance in 73% of patients for the mid-NAC evaluation,with a 'good' correlation for the difference in longest diameter measurement (ICC0.73, p < 0.01) as compared to baseline assessment. Concerning difference involume measurement in the mid-NAC response evaluation showed a 'fair' correlation(ICC 0.52, p < 0.01) and in the post-NAC response evaluation an 'excellent'correlation (ICC 0.98, p < 0.01). 'Excellent' inter- and intra-observer agreementwas found (ICC 0.88, p < 0.01) with comparable limits of agreement (LOA) forobserver 1 and 2 in both diameter and volume measurement. Patient satisfactionwas higher for ABVS compared to breast MRI, 93% versus 12% respectively.CONCLUSION: ABVS showed 'good' correlation with MRI tumour response evaluation inbreast cancer patients during NAC with 'excellent' inter- and intra-observeragreement. ABVS has patients' preference over breast MRI and could be considered as alternative to breast MRI, in case results on an on-going prospective trialconfirm these results (NTR6799).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
