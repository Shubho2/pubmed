Thisis a very aggressive tumor with poor prognosis. Other sites of primary SCC shouldbe ruled out first to classify these tumors as primary SCC of the breast. Here wepresent a case of locally advanced primary SCC of the breast.CASE REPORT: A 72 years old woman presented with a right axillary lump. Trucutbiopsy was performed, it showed squamous cell carcinoma. Estrogen receptor hadpoor immunoreactivity, negative for both progesteron receptor and HER 2 inimmunohistochemistry staining. PETCT imaging were conducted to showing only6 × 6.5 cm mass in right breast adjacent to axilla, multiple lymphadenomegaly in right axillary. We planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of weeklypaclitaxel followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide combination. Postoperativepathology revealed wide necrosis, no viable tumor cell. We started adjuvantanastrozole treatment of 1 mg/day. No evidence of disease was detected after 1year follow up.CONCLUSION: Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is a very rare disease with no standard treatment approach. Our case achieved pathologic completeresponse after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2018.04.003 PMID: 29880396
