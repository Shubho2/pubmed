To promotesuccessful SDM, it is crucial to assess the level of perceived involvement in SDMin women with breast cancer.OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to apply Rasch analysis to examine theconstruct validity and person reliability of the 9-item Shared Decision MakingQuestionnaire (SDM-Q-9) in women with breast cancer.METHODS: The construct validity of SDM-Q-9 was confirmed when the items fit theRasch model's assumptions of unidimensionality: (1) infit and outfit mean square ranged from 0.6 to 1.4; (2) the unexplained variance of the first dimension ofthe principal component analysis was less than 20%. Person reliability wascalculated.RESULTS: A total of 212 participants were recruited in this study. Item 1 did notfit the model's assumptions and was deleted. The unidimensionality of theremaining 8 items (SDM-Q-8) was supported with good item fit (infit and outfitmean square ranging from 0.6 to 1.3) and very low unexplained variance of thefirst dimension (5.3%) of the principal component analysis. The personreliability of the SDM-Q-8 was 0.90.CONCLUSIONS: The SDM-Q-8 was unidimensional and had good person reliability inwomen with breast cancer.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The SDM-Q-8 has shown its potential for assessing the level of perceived involvement in SDM in women with breast cancer for bothresearch and clinical purposes.DOI: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000607 PMID: 29677010
