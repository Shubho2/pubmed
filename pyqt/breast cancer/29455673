Many of these kinases areassociated with human cancer initiation and progression. The recent developmentof small-molecule kinase inhibitors for the treatment of diverse types of cancer has proven successful in clinical therapy. Significantly, protein kinases are thesecond most targeted group of drug targets, after the G-protein-coupledreceptors. Since the development of the first protein kinase inhibitor, in theearly 1980s, 37 kinase inhibitors have received FDA approval for treatment ofmalignancies such as breast and lung cancer. Furthermore, about 150kinase-targeted drugs are in clinical phase trials, and many kinase-specificinhibitors are in the preclinical stage of drug development. Nevertheless, manyfactors confound the clinical efficacy of these molecules. Specific tumorgenetics, tumor microenvironment, drug resistance, and pharmacogenomics determinehow useful a compound will be in the treatment of a given cancer. This reviewprovides an overview of kinase-targeted drug discovery and development inrelation to oncology and highlights the challenges and future potential forkinase-targeted cancer therapies.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0804-2 PMCID: PMC5817855PMID: 29455673
