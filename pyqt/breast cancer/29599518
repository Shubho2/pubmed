Womenwithout a known strong family history of breast and/or ovarian may be morevulnerable to psychological sequelae arising from TFGT. We compared the impact ofTFGT in women with (FH+) and without (FH-) a strong family history onpsychological adjustment and surgical decisions. Women aged <50 years withhigh-risk features were offered TFGT before definitive breast cancer surgery and completed self-report questionnaires at four time points over 12 months. All 128 women opted for TFGT. TFGT identified 18 carriers of a disease-causing variant(50.0% FH+) and 110 non-carriers (59.1% FH+). There were no differences based on family history in bilateral mastectomy (BM) uptake, p = .190, or uptake ofrisk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO), p = .093. FH- women hadlower decreases in anxiety a year after diagnosis, p = .011, and regret regardingtheir decision whether to undergo BM, p = .022, or RRBSO, p = .016 thanFH + women. FH- carriers reported significantly higher regret regarding theirTFGT choice (p = .024) and test-related distress (p = .012) than FH + carriers,but this regret/distress could not be attributed to a concern regarding apossible worse prognosis. These findings indicate that FH- women may requireadditional counselling to facilitate informed decisions. Carriers without afamily history may require additional follow-up counselling to facilitatepsychological adjustment to their positive variant results, extra support inmaking surgical decisions, and counselling about how best to communicate results to family members.DOI: 10.1038/s41431-017-0057-3 PMCID: PMC6018744 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29599518
