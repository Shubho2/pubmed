In the present study, the association between theexpression of LOX family members and FF with regards to with inflammation wasanalyzed, and the prognostic significance of LOX and FF in breast cancer wasinvestigated. Immunohistochemical staining for LOX, LOX-like protein (LOXL) 1,LOXL2 and LOXL3 was performed in primary breast cancer tissues. The status of FF within the tumor was assessed, including size and grade. Levels of inflammatorymarkers, intratumoral and peritumoral lymphocyte infiltration were alsoevaluated. The clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated from themedical records of patients. In the present study, the expression of LOX familymembers was not associated with the presence of FF. FF was identified to beassociated with intratumoral and peritumoral inflammation, tumor stage, largertumor size, lymph node metastasis, high histologic grade, and p53 expression. LOXand LOXL3 were associated with intratumoral, and peritumoral inflammation.Furthermore, LOXL1 was associated with intratumoral inflammation andinterleukin-4. In addition, LOX was associated with cluster of differentiation 8+T cells. LOXL3 was associated with expression of ER and PR, and molecularsubtype. In the survival analysis, overall survival time was statisticallysignificantly longer in the FF-negative compared with that in the FF-positivegroup. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that FF and the expression of LOXfamily members were associated with inflammation in breast cancer. FF wasassociated with poor prognostic markers of breast cancer. Further studies arerequired to clarify the mechanisms underlying the association between the LOXfamily, FF and inflammation in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7617 PMCID: PMC5777281PMID: 29434955
