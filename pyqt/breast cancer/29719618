ONC201 was originally identified as a small molecule thatinduces transcription of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) andsubsequently kills cancer cells by activating TRAIL death receptors. In thisstudy, we examined ONC201 toxicity on multiple human breast and endometrialcancer cell lines. ONC201 attenuated cell viability in all cancer cell linestested. Unexpectedly, ONC201 toxicity was not dependent on either TRAIL receptorsnor caspases. Time-lapse live cell imaging revealed that ONC201 induces cellmembrane ballooning followed by rupture, distinct from the morphology of cellsundergoing apoptosis. Further investigation found that ONC201 inducesphosphorylation of AMP-dependent kinase and ATP loss. Cytotoxicity and ATPdepletion were significantly enhanced in the absence of glucose, suggesting that ONC201 targets mitochondrial respiration. Further analysis indicated that ONC201 indirectly inhibits mitochondrial respiration. Confocal and electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that ONC201 triggers mitochondrial structural damage andfunctional impairment. Moreover, ONC201 decreased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).RNAseq analysis revealed that ONC201 suppresses expression of multiplemtDNA-encoded genes and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes involved in oxidativephosphorylation and other mitochondrial functions. Importantly, fumaratehydratase deficient cancer cells and multiple cancer cell lines with reducedamounts of mtDNA were resistant to ONC201. These results indicate that cells not dependent on mitochondrial respiration are ONC201-resistant. Our data demonstratethat ONC201 kills cancer cells by disrupting mitochondrial function and furthersuggests that cancer cells that are dependent on glycolysis will be resistant to ONC201.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24862 PMCID: PMC5915085PMID: 29719618
