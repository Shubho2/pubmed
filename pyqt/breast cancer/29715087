Therefore, exploration of treatment alternatives is ofclinical relevance. The present work focused on tumor cell-inhibiting effects of a combination of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in breast cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Breast cancer cell lines (BT-20, BT-474, MDA-MB-231,MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-453, MCF-7, SKBR3, T47D, ZR-75-1) and the mammary epithelialcell line MCF-10A were treated with TRAIL and ATRA alone and in combination. Cellviability was assessed via3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-yl)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assay, thepotential of cell colony formation via clonogenic assay, cell death induction viacell-cycle analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), terminaldeoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and Celldeath detection ELISAPLUS, expression of apoptosis and TRAIL pathway proteins viawestern blot and cell surface expression of TRAIL receptor 1 (DR4) via FACSanalysis.RESULTS: TRAIL and ATRA evoked synergistic inhibition of breast cancer cellviability based on cytostatic and cytotoxic mechanisms. This correlated withaugmented fragmentation of nuclear DNA, up-regulation of TRAIL receptor,down-regulation of cyclin D1 and enhancement of caspase activity. MCF-10A cellswere merely slightly susceptible to TRAIL and ATRA.CONCLUSION: The cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of the combination of TRAIL and ATRA are tumor cell-selective.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12509 PMID: 29715087  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
