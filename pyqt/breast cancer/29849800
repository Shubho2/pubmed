HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) is themost abundant envelope protein and serves an important role in host cell entry.The present study aimed to clarify the role of HCMV gB in breast cancer cells. A HCMV gB construct (UL55) was generated and stable vUL55 genelentivirus-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were established. Subsequently, theeffect of HCMV gB on the apoptosis and proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells wasmeasured by flow cytometry and Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Furthermore, whetherHCMV gB may modulate MDA-MB-231 cell migration was examined using Transwell andcell scratch assays. In addition, alterations in HCMV gB-modulated protein levelsof transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and Mothers against decapentaplegichomologs 2/3 (Smad2/3) were detected using western blot analysis. The resultsindicated that UL55 cDNA was stably transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells, and thatHCMV gB protein was stably expressed. No significant differences in cellapoptosis and proliferation between transfected (231-GB-OE) and negative control (231-NC) cells were observed, while the rate of cell migration was significantly decreased in the 231-GB-OE cells compared with the 231-NC cells. Additionally,the expression level of TGF-β and phosphorylation level of Smad2/3 were alsodecreased in 231-GB-OE cells compared with the 231-NC cells. Although certainprevious studies indicated that HCMV infection was associated with breastcarcinogenesis, the results of the present study indicate that the envelopeprotein HCMV gB exhibits no effect on cell apoptosis and proliferation, butinhibits breast cancer cell migration. This may be due to downregulatedTGF-β/Smad signaling. Taken together, these studies may assist in developinganti-TGF-β agents that contribute to tumor suppression.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8344 PMCID: PMC5962863PMID: 29849800
