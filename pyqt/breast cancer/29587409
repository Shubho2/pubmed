The active transporters currentlyknown to efflux antiviral drugs are P-glycoprotein (ABCB1 or P-gp or MDR1),multidrug resistance-associated proteins (ABCC1 or MRP1, ABCC4 or MRP4, ABCC5 or MRP5), and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2 or BCRP). Inhibitors of AETsmay be considered, but their co-administration causes serious unwanted effects.Nasal administration of antiviral drugs is therefore proposed in order toovercome the aforementioned problems, but innovative devices, formulations(thermoreversible gels, polymeric micro- and nano-particles, solid lipidmicroparticles, nanoemulsions), absorption enhancers (chitosan, papaverine), and mucoadhesive agents (chitosan, polyvinilpyrrolidone) are required in order toselectively target the antiviral drugs and, possibly, the AET inhibitors in theCNS. Moreover, several prodrugs of antiretroviral agents can inhibit or elude theAET systems, appearing as interesting substrates for innovative nasalformulations able to target anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) agents intomacrophages of the CNS, which are one of the most important HIV Sanctuaries ofthe body.DOI: 10.3390/pharmaceutics10020039 PMCID: PMC6027266PMID: 29587409
