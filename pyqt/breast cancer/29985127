However, physiological motion caused byperistalsis, respiration and the heartbeat can present a significant challenge,particularly for functional readouts such as fluorescence lifetime imaging(FLIM), which require longer acquisition times to obtain a quantitative readout. Here, we present and benchmark Galene, a versatile multi-platform software toolfor image-based correction of sample motion blurring in both time resolved andconventional laser scanning fluorescence microscopy data in two and threedimensions. We show that Galene is able to resolve intravital FLIM-FRET images ofintra-abdominal organs in murine models and NADH autofluorescence of human dermaltissue imaging subject to a wide range of physiological motions. Thus, Galene canenable FLIM imaging in situations where a stable imaging platform is not alwayspossible and rescue previously discarded quantitative imaging data.© 2018, Warren et al.DOI: 10.7554/eLife.35800 PMCID: PMC6037484PMID: 29985127
