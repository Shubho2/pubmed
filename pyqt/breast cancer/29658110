[Epub ahead of print]Prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure and mammographic density.Strohsnitter WC(1), Bertrand KA(2), Troisi R(3), Scott CG(4), Cheville AL(5),Hoover RN(3), Palmer JR(2), Vachon CM(4).Author information: (1)Department of Molecular, Cell, and Cancer Biology, University of MassachusettsMedical School, Worcester, MA.(2)Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University, Boston, MA.(3)Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health,National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics,Bethesda, MD.(4)Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.(5)Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester,MN.In a prospective cohort study of the health effects associated with prenatalDiethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure, DES was associated with an increased breastcancer risk after 40 years of age. It is unknown whether it is associated withgreater mammographic density, which strongly predicts breast cancer risk. Acohort of DES-exposed and unexposed women was assembled at the Mayo Clinic in1975, and followed through 2012 as part of the National Cancer Institute's DESfollow-up study. Mammographic density from 3,637 mammograms for 332 (222DES-exposed, 110 unexposed) women in this cohort screened at the Mayo Clinic,Rochester between 1996 and 2015 was determined clinically using the BreastImaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). Any effect of prenatal DES exposure on mammographic density was estimated using repeated measures logisticregression. There was no association between prenatal DES exposure and highmammographic density for either premenopausal [Odds ratios (OR) = 0.92 (95%Confidence Interval (CI): 0.50, 1.7] or postmenopausal women (OR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.5). Among premenopausal women, associations differed by body mass index(BMI), with ORs of 1.47 (0.70, 3.1) for women with BMI above the median and 0.53 (0.23, 1.3) for those with BMI below the median (pinteraction  = 0.05). Overall, however, prenatal DES exposure was not associated with high mammographic density in this sample of DES Study participants. Consequently, this study does notprovide evidence that high mammographic density is involved with the influence ofDES on breast cancer risk.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31524 PMID: 29658110
