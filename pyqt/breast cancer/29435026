China.Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) oil is an important polyunsaturated fatty acid for thehuman body. Evidence has demonstrated that DHA is beneficial for inhibitingmammary carcinogenesis. However, the mechanisms of DHA mediating apoptosisinduction have not been fully elucidated. Thus, in the present study, theactivity levels of total-superoxide dismutase (t-SOD), catalase (CAT),glutathione-peroxidase (GSH-PX) and the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA)were determined in DHA oil-treated human malignant breast tissues. The resultsrevealed that compared with control, DHA significantly increased the mainantioxidant enzymes levels, including t-SOD, CAT, and GSH-PX, but decreased theMDA concentration in the DHA oil treated breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, DHA significantly increased the ratio of cyclic (c)AMP/cGMP levels and promoted theexpression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-α, thus DHA induced breast cancer cell apoptosis. We hypothesizedthat the levels of TLR-4 and PPAR-α are involved in the antitumorigenesisproperties of DHA in breast cancer. The results of the present study holdsignificance for the further clinical development of DHA oil in breast cancertreatment.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7702 PMCID: PMC5778790PMID: 29435026
