However, its clinical significanceand biological role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. In the presentstudy, the expression of HES6 was significantly upregulated in CRC cell lines andCRC tissues at both the mRNA and protein levels. The present study also reported high expression of HES6 in 138/213 (64.8%) paraffin-embedded archived CRCspecimens. HES6 expression was significantly correlated with T classification(P<0.001), N classification (P=0.020), and distant metastasis (P<0.001). Patientswith higher HES6 expression levels exhibited a reduced overall survival(P<0.001). In addition, a multivariate analysis revealed that the expression ofHES6 may be a novel prognostic marker for the survival of patients with CRC.Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that ectopic expression of HES6enhanced the migration and invasive abilities of CRC cells. These abilities were significantly inhibited upon knockdown of endogenous HES6 expression by specific short hairpin RNAs. Additionally, the present study reported that the effects of HES6 on metastasis may be associated with the activation of the Wnt/β-cateninsignaling pathway. Collectively, the findings of the present study revealed that overexpression of HES6 played a key role in the progression of CRC, leading to a poor prognosis and clinical outcome.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6539 PMID: 30015909
