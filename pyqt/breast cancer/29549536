Therefore, thisretrospective study identified factors that could predict these eligible patientsto maintain the RDI. The participants included 166 cancer patients undergoingpegfilgrastim prophylaxis combined with chemotherapy in our outpatientchemotherapy center between March 2015 and April 2017. Variables were extractedfrom clinical records for regression analysis of factors related to maintenanceof the RDI. RDI was classified into four categories: 100% = 0, 85% or < 100% = 1,60% or < 85% = 2, and < 60% = 3. Multivariate ordered logistic regressionanalysis was performed to identify predictive factors in patients eligible forpegfilgrastim prophylaxis to maintain the RDI. Threshold measures were examinedusing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis curve. Age [odds ratio(OR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.11; P < 0.0001], anemia (grade)(OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.10-2.84; P = 0.0184), and administration 24-72 h afterchemotherapy (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.89; P = 0.0224) were factors thatsignificantly correlated with RDI maintenance. ROC curve analysis of the groupthat failed to maintain the RDI indicated that the threshold for age was 70 yearsand above, with a sensitivity of 60.0% and specificity of 80.2% (area under thecurve: 0.74). In conclusion, younger age, anemia (less), and administration ofpegfilgrastim 24-72 h after chemotherapy were significant factors for RDImaintenance.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1116-5 PMID: 29549536
