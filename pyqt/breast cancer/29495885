In this study, a cationicbioadhesive nanoemulsion was developed for intraductal administration of C6ceramide, a sphingolipid that mediates apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death.Bioadhesive properties were obtained by surface modification with chitosan. Theoptimized nanoemulsion displayed size of 46.3 nm and positive charge, properties that were not affected by ceramide encapsulation (0.4%, w/w). C6 ceramideconcentration necessary to reduce MCF-7 cells viability to 50% (EC50) decreasedby 4.5-fold with its nanoencapsulation compared to its solution; a furtherdecrease (2.6-fold) was observed when tributyrin (a pro-drug of butyric acid) waspart of the oil phase of the nanocarrier, a phenomenon attributed to synergism.The unloaded nanocarrier was considered safe, as indicated by a score <0.1 inHET-CAM models, by the high survival rates of Galleria mellonella larvae exposed to concentrations ≤500 mg/mL, and absence of histological changes whenintraductally administered in rats. Intraductal administration of thenanoemulsion prolonged drug localization for more than 120 h in the mammarytissue compared to its solution. These results support the advantage of theoptimized nanoemulsion to enable mammary tissue localization of C6 ceramide.DOI: 10.1080/10717544.2018.1440665 PMID: 29495885
