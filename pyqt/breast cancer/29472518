Toinvestigate intrinsic and adaptive mechanisms of resistance, we analyzed a panel of patient-derived xenograft models of TNBC with varying responsiveness tobuparlisib, a pan-PI3K inhibitor. In a subset of patient-derived xenografts,resistance was associated with incomplete inhibition of PI3K signaling andupregulated MAPK/MEK signaling in response to buparlisib. Outlier phosphoproteomeand kinome analyses identified novel candidates functionally important tobuparlisib resistance, including NEK9 and MAP2K4. Knockdown of NEK9 or MAP2K4reduced both baseline and feedback MAPK/MEK signaling and showed syntheticlethality with buparlisib in vitro A complex in/del frameshift in PIK3CAdecreased sensitivity to buparlisib via NEK9/MAP2K4-dependent mechanisms. Insummary, our study supports a role for NEK9 and MAP2K4 in mediating buparlisibresistance and demonstrates the value of unbiased omic analyses in uncoveringresistance mechanisms to targeted therapy.Significance: Integrativephosphoproteogenomic analysis is used to determine intrinsic resistancemechanisms of triple-negative breast tumors to PI3K inhibition.
