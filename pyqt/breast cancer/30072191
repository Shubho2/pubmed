We conducted a randomized phase II to compare these regimens asneoadjuvant chemotherapy for HER2- early-stage breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Stage I-III human epidermal growth factor receptor-negative(HER2-) breast cancer patients were included in the present trial and receivedeither docetaxel every 3 weeks or nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28days for 4 cycles, followed by FEC (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide)every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. The primary endpoint was the pathologic completeresponse (pCR) rate, defined as ypT0 and ypN0. The secondary endpoints were pCR(ypT0/ypTis and ypN0), the clinical response rate (using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria), histologic effect of treatment (using theJapanese Breast Cancer Society classification), breast conservation rate, andadverse events.RESULTS: A total of 152 eligible patients were enrolled at 6 centers. Thebaseline characteristics were well balanced. In comparing the 2 regimens(docetaxel/nab-paclitaxel), the pCR rate was 12% and 17% (P = .323). In the Ki67 > 20% group, the pCR rate was greater (24%) for the nab-paclitaxel arm than forthe docetaxel arm (16%; P = .432). The most common grade 3/4 adverse event wasneutropenia, observed in 40% and 36% of cases in the nab-paclitaxel and docetaxelarms, respectively. The nonhematologic adverse events of any grade were myalgia(34% and 32%), arthralgia (42% and 35%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (55%and 65%) for the 2 treatment arms. No grade 3/4 peripheral sensory neuropathy wasobserved in the nab-paclitaxel arm.CONCLUSION: Weekly nab-paclitaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 showedequivalent efficacy and was well tolerated compared with docetaxel as neoadjuvanttherapy. Nab-paclitaxel might be more effective in patients with highlyproliferative cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.06.012 PMID: 30072191
