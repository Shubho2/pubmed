China.A genetically engineered Salmonella typhimurium strain that may be applied in themedically useful therapeutic strategy of using bacterial agents to target breast cancer in a tumor-bearing nude mouse model has been previously reported.Furthermore, immune cell accumulation in breast tumor types has been observed,particularly distributed in regions surrounding the bacteria. M2 macrophages are associated with breast cancer aggressiveness, whereas M1 macrophages are prone todevouring bacteria and killing cancer cells. Therefore, this engineeredtumor-targeting salmonella strain was used in an attempt to reverse the phenotypeof M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype. Subsequent to the co-culture of M2macrophages with the bacteria for a short time, >50% of the M2 macrophages wereinvaded by bacteria. These M2 macrophages exhibited a decreased expression ofmannose receptor (an M2 phenotypic marker) and increased expression of humanleukocyte antigen-antigen D related (an M1 phenotypic marker). The results of thepresent study indicated that differentiated M2 macrophages may be redirected intothe M1 phenotype following exposure to the engineered bacteria stimulus. Thiseffect may be a potential mechanism by which bacteria retard tumor growth. Thus, this engineered bacterium may be a useful candidate for targeting and redirectingM2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7742 PMCID: PMC5795882PMID: 29456740
