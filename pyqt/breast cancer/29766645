Box 16168,Zawia, Libya.Naringenin is a naturally occurring flavonoid and due to its broad spectrum ofbiological activities, including anticancer properties, has attracted scientific attention in recent years. To contribute to these studies, we synthesized somenew (±)-naringenin cyclic aminoethyl derivatives, analyzed the cytotoxic andanti-proliferative properties of them via3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, andmitochondrial apoptosis signaling response and gene expressions belong tocaspase-3 depended apoptosis as biomarkers in both healthy and cancer cell lines.Our results suggest that some of our naringenin derivatives are potentialanticancer agents with a selective death potential and targeting properties formitochondrial apoptosis signaling against at least human cervix and breastcancer.© 2018 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.DOI: 10.1002/cbdv.201800016 PMID: 29766645  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
