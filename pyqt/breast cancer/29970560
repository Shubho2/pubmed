In this study, we directly analyzed breast carcinomatissues embedded in frozen tissue microarrays (fTMAs) using MALDImass-spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI).MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 119 breast tissues (84 carcinoma and 35 normal)were used. MSI data were extracted from each tissue.RESULTS: Overall, 185 of 1,915 peaks which were commonly detected in 60% oftarget areas were subjected to further analysis. One hundred and fifty-two peaks of carcinoma showed significantly higher intensity than normal. Comparingmetabolite profiles from carcinoma and normal tissues, energy charge (EC) and thesum of adenosine phosphate compound (AXP) indicated significantly higherintensities in cancerous tissues than normal. But comparisons of EC and AXP amonglymph node metastasis, tumor size and tumor subtypes indicated no significantdifferences.CONCLUSION: Breast carcinoma tissues had higher EC and AXP values than normal.MALDI-MSI could be a tool for characterizing breast carcinoma.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12723 PMID: 29970560  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
