Both qualitative and quantitative analyses usingtumor-to-normal background ratio (TNR) and coefficient of variation (COV) wereperformed, and the predictive significance for upstaging to invasive cancer wasinvestigated. We also sought to identify clinicopathological factors associatedwith upstaging and their relation to BSGI findings.RESULTS: Fifty-eight lesions (33.1%) were confirmed to be invasive breast cancer after the final surgical approach. On univariate analysis, tumor size based onultrasonography (US), hormone status, histologic grade, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category, comedo-necrosis, Ki-67 expression, and BSGI findingswere associated with upstaging to invasive cancer. Tumor size > 2.0 cm(p = 0.005), Ki-67 expression > 8% (p < 0.001), qualitative BSGI findings(p = 0.020), and COV > 30.44 (p = 0.022) were independently associated withupstaging after multiple regression analysis.CONCLUSION: BSGI is a useful imaging modality for predicting upstaging toinvasive breast cancer from DCIS on core-needle biopsy in conjunction with UStumor size and Ki-67 expression.DOI: 10.1007/s12149-018-1251-2 PMID: 29556944
