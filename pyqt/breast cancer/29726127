Thermography is a nonionizing, noninvasive, portable, and low-cost method that can be used in an outpatient clinic. It was tried as a tool to detect breastcancer tumors, however, it had too many false readings. Thermography has beenextensively studied as a breast cancer detection tool but was not used as atreatment monitoring tool. The purpose of this study was to investigate thepossibility of using thermal imaging as a feedback system to optimize radiationtherapy. Patients were imaged with a thermal camera prior and throughout theradiotherapy sessions. At the end of the session, the images were analyzed fortemporal vasculature changes through vessels segmentation image processing tools.Tumors that were not responsive to treatment were observed before the radiationtherapy sessions were concluded. Assessing the efficacy of radiotherapy duringtreatment makes it possible to change the treatment regimen, dose, and radiation field during treatment as well as to individualize treatment schedules tooptimize treatment effectiveness.(2018) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).DOI: 10.1117/1.JBO.23.5.058001 PMCID: PMC5933077 [Available on 2019-05-03]PMID: 29726127
