In this study, the inhibitory effects of ATPR on the proliferation,invasion, and migration of breast cancer (BC) cells, and the relationship betweenATPR and the expression of the intracellular lipid-binding proteins CRABP2 andFABP5 were investigated.Methods: CRABP2 and FABP5 expression was evaluated in infiltratingbreast-infiltrating ductal carcinoma(BIDC) and benign breast fibroma (BBF) byimmunohistochemistry and in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-453 cellsby immunofluorescence. The inhibition of proliferation by ATPR in these cells wasdetected by MTT. After downregulation and upregulation of CRABP2 and FABP5 inMCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells using siRNA and plasmids, the effect of ATPR onproliferation was detected by MTT and real-time cell analysis, and the effects ofATPR on the invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells were detected using aBoyden chamber assay and a wound healing assay.Results: CRABP2 expression was moderately or strongly positive in BIDC and BBF.FABP5 expression was also moderately or strongly positive in BIDC, but weaklypositive or negative in BBF. CRABP2 and FABP5 were highly expressed in MCF-7cells, moderately expressed in MDA-MB-453 cells, and weakly expressed inMDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells. ATPR inhibited proliferation more strongly inMCF-7 cells than in other cells. The inhibition of proliferation by ATPR dependedon an increase in CRABP2, but not FABP5 expression. A decrease in FABP5 couldinhibit the invasion and migration of BC cells.Conclusion: These findings indicate that ATPR might inhibit proliferation byupregulating CRABP2, and inhibit invasion and migration by downregulating FABP5in BC cells. These findings may facilitate the use of differentiation therapy in BC.DOI: 10.2147/DDDT.S151029 PMCID: PMC5927060PMID: 29731607
