Electronic address: 18961325781@163.com.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is considered to be the most aggressive and lethal type of breast cancer. Many studies have suggested that the dysfunction oflong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is correlated with breast cancer metastasis andprogression. Here, we show that levels of the lncRNA, growth arrest-specifictranscript 5 (GAS5), are decreased in TNBC tissues, and this down-regulation ofGAS5 is associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype in patients, affectingclinical stage, lymph node metastasis and overall survival. Using an ectopicoverexpression system in TNBC cells, we found that up-regulation of GAS5 cansignificantly attenuate proliferation and enhance apoptosis in TNBC cells.Through bioinformatics analysis and verification with qRT-PCR and luciferaseassay, we found that GAS5 can bind to miR-196a-5p and there is a negativerelationship between GAS5 and miR-196a-5p expression among TNBC patient samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated that overexpression of GAS5 can partially undermine the tumor promotion effect induced by ectopic expression of miR-196a-5p,including invasion and downstream FOXO1/PI3K/AKT signal pathway activation. Inour study, GAS5 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) antagonizingtumor promotion of miR-196a-5p-expressing TNBC cells. These data suggest thatGAS5 can suppress TNBC progression by competitively binding miR-196a-5p,therefore GAS5 may be a prognostic biomarker of TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
