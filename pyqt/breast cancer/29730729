All mammograms were firstinterpreted by a technologist and then double read in a blinded fashion by a teamof 13 screening radiologists. All concordant and discordant positive readingsamong radiologists were recalled.RESULTS: Out of 3562 recalls, 998 women were recalled after a discordant reading.Of these women, 337 (33.8%) had a positive technologist assessment, of which 40(11.9%) were diagnosed with breast cancer. Sixty women with a negativetechnologist assessment (60/661, 9.1%) were diagnosed with breast cancer(p = 0.16). Recall rate would have decreased with technologist arbitration (3.6% vs. 2.9%, p < 0.001). Cancer detection rate decreased with 8.5%, from 7.1/1000screens to 6.5/1000 screens (p = 0.10). Among women with a positive technologist assessment, the probability of breast cancer was highest in case of suspiciousmicrocalcifications and lowest for suspicious masses (30.4% (17/56) versus 7.0%(16/212), p < 0.001). Breast cancers were diagnosed in all groups of mammographicabnormalities, except in women with a suspicious asymmetry and a negativetechnologist assessment.CONCLUSIONS: Assessment by a technologist does not provide a significantdiscriminating ability in case of a discordant radiologist reading and, takinginto account the decrease in cancer detection rate, does not appear to be asuitable arbitration strategy for discordant recalls at blinded double reading.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4800-4 PMID: 29730729
