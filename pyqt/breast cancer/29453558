Thesenanotechnology-based techniques can be applied widely in the management ofdifferent malignant diseases, such as breast cancer. Although the number ofdifferent types of nanoparticles is increasing rapidly, most can be classifiedinto two major types: particles that contain organic molecules as a majorbuilding material (such as dendrimers, micelles, liposomes and carbon nanotubes, and other polymers); and those that use inorganic elements, usually metals, as a core. In particular, inorganic nanoparticles have received increased attention inthe recent past as potential diagnostic and therapeutic systems in the field ofoncology. This review primarily discusses progress in applications of inorganicnanoparticles for breast cancer imaging and treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s00775-018-1542-z PMID: 29453558
