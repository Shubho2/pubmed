This work demonstrates an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)-based biosensor for thedetection of glycan expression on living cancer cells. Herein, mannose on humanbreast cancer cells (MCF-7) as the target glycan model, poly dimethyl diallylammonium chloride-multiwall carbon nanotubes (PDDA-MWCNTs) as the loadinginterface, concanavalin A (Con A) with active mannose binding sites, aptamer and horseradish peroxidase co-immobilized gold nanoparticles (HRP-aptamer-Au NPs) as specific nanoprobes are used to fabricate the OECT biosensor. In this strategy,PDDA-MWCNT interfaces can enhance the loading of Con A, and the target cells can be captured through Con A via active mannose binding sites. Thus, the expression of cell surface can be reflected by the amount of cells captured on the gate.Specific nanoprobes are introduced to the captured cells to produce an OECTsignal because of the reduction of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by HRP conjugated on Au nanoparticles, while the aptamer on nanoprobes can selectively recognizethe MCF-7 cells. It is reasonable that more target cells are captured on the gateelectrode, more HRP-nanoprobes are loaded thus a larger signal response. Thedevice shows an obvious response to MCF-7 cells down to 10 cells/Î¼L and can beused to selectively monitor the change of mannose expression on cell surfacesupon a treatment with the N-glycan inhibitor. The OECT-based biosensor ispromising for the analysis of glycan expressions on the surfaces of differenttypes of cells.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b01987 PMID: 29749223
