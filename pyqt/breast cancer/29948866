The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) using SPION inprostate cancer and to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy.METHODS: Twenty patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer wereprospectively enrolled in 2016. After intraprostatic injection of SPION, SLNDusing magnetometer was performed the following day. Extended pelvic lymph nodedissection (ePLND) was added as a reference standard test. The diagnosticperformance of the test were evaluated, as well as the rate of in vivo detectedSLN. Surgical times of SLND and ePLND were compared using paired two-sample ttest.RESULTS: In total, 97 SLN were detected with median 5 (IQR 3-7) per patient.Non-diagnostic rate of the procedure was 5%. In total, 19 nodal metastases werefound in 5 patients, of which 12 were located in SLN. The sensitivity per patientfor the whole cohort was 80% and per node 56%. If only patients with at least onedetected SLN were considered, the sensitivity per patient and per node reached100 and 82%, respectively. A median of 20 LNs (IQR 18-22) were removed bysubsequent ePLND. Surgical times of SLND and ePLND differed significantly, withmedians of 17 and 39 min, respectively (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: SLND with SPION is feasible and safe in prostate cancer and thediagnostic accuracy is comparable to the published results of radioguidedprocedures. In open surgery, SPION may be used as an alternative tracer with its main advantage being the lack of radiation hazard.DOI: 10.1007/s11255-018-1903-0 PMID: 29948866
