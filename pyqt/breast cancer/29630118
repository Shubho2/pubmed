However, the effect of miR-330-3p in BC progression remains largely unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate theclinical significance of miR-330-3p expression in BC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of miR-330-3p was detected by quantitativeReal-time PCR in BC tissues and matched normal breast tissues. The association ofmiR-330-3p expression with clinicopathological factors of BC patients was alsoanalyzed by x2-test. Prognosis value of patients with BC was assessed byKaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model, respectively.RESULTS: Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression level of miR-330-3p was significantly higher in BC specimens than that in correspondingnoncancerous tissues (p < 0.01). The levels of miR-330-3p were positivelycorrelated with the status of TNM stage (p = 0.011) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.006). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 5-year overall survival of BCpatients with high miR-330-3p expression was shorter compared to those patientswith low miR-330-3p expression (p < 0.0001). Moreover, univariate andmultivariate regression analysis demonstrated that miR-330-3p was an independent prognostic factor in BC.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that miR-330-3p upregulation maybe concurrentlyassociated with prognosis in patients with BC, suggesting that miR-330-3p may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with BC.PMID: 29630118
