Electronic address:elahe.bozorgzadeh@gmail.com.The new sensitive diagnostic method, electrochemical nanobiosensor, is applied tocancer detection by using specific biomarkers such as miRNA. Studies have shownthat for the diagnosis of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) patients, in theearly stages of the disease, miR-199a-5p as circulating miRNA can be a suitablecandidate. In this study, a new electrochemical nanobiosensor for serummiR-199a-5p detection was designed by using modified glassy carbon electrode(GCE) with graphene oxide (GO) and gold nanoroad (GNR) on which a thiolated probewas immobilized. The electrochemical impedance method (EIS) was used to examinethe electrochemical characteristics and behavior of nanobiosensor and forverifying the nanomaterial synthesis the scanning electron microscope (SEM) were applied, field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), UV-Visspectrophotometry and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Optimum conditionswere investigated for designed nanobiosensor and in optimal conditions, followingresults were obtained; the linear range of the calibration curve from 15 fM to148 pM, the detection limit of 4.5 fM, and the standard deviation of 2.9%. Theresearch data showed that our designed electrochemical nanobiosensor has asensitivity and desirable precision for evaluation of miR-199a-5p that can beused to measure low concentrations of miR-199a-5p in blood serum sample.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
