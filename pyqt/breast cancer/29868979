The study prospectively assessed how oftenALND could be replaced by AxRT in a consecutive cohort of patients undergoingmastectomy for cT1-2 N0 breast cancer.METHODS: In November 2015, our multidisciplinary group agreed to omit routineintraoperative SLN evaluation for cT1-2 N0 patients undergoing upfront mastectomyand potentially eligible for postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT), includingthose 60 years of age or younger and those older than 60 years with high-riskfeatures. Patients with one or two positive SLNs on final pathology were reviewedto determine whether PMRT including the full axilla was an appropriatealternative to ALND.RESULTS: From November 2015 to December 2016, 154 patients met the studycriteria, and 114 (74%) formed the final study cohort. Intraoperative SLNevaluation was omitted for 76 patients (67%). Of these patients, 20 (26%) had oneor two positive SLNs, and 14 of these patients received PMRT + AxRT as analternative to ALND. Three patients returned for ALND, and three patients wereobserved. On univariate analysis, tumor size, LVI, number of positive lymphnodes, and receipt of chemotherapy were associated with receipt of PMRT.CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of patients with one or two positive SLNs, ALND wasavoided in favor of PMRT + AxRT. With appropriate multidisciplinary strategies,intraoperative evaluation of the SLN and immediate ALND can be avoided forpatients meeting the AMAROS criteria and eligible for PMRT.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6525-3 PMID: 29868979
