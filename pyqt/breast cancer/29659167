Epub 2018 Apr 16.The bidirectional association among female hormone-related cancers: breast,ovary, and uterine corpus.Chen MC(1)(2), Lee KD(3)(4), Lu CH(2), Wang TY(2), Huang SH(1), Chen CY(5).Author information: (1)Department of Public Health, Biostatistics Consulting Center, College ofMedicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.(2)Department of Hematology & Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi,Taiwan.(3)Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, TaipeiMedical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.(4)School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei,Taiwan.(5)Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi,Taiwan.Breast, ovarian, and uterine corpus cancers are common female cancers andcategorized as hormone-related diseases. Previous studies reported aunidirectional relationship for each cancer, but few studied the reciprocalassociation in the same cohort. A population-based study was carried out inTaiwan to test the hypothesis that there are pairwise bidirectional associations among these cancers. Using the same cohort of 110,112 cases with primary femalecancers including uterine corpus cancer (11,146 cases), ovarian cancer (12,139cases), or breast cancer (86,827 cases) from the Taiwan Cancer Registry from 1979to 2008, the pairwise risks of second cancer among uterine corpus, ovary, andbreast cancer cases were evaluated by standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) andthe corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to quantify the excess of secondmalignancies. A reciprocal relationship was found for these three female cancers,particularly most prominent between uterine and ovarian cancers, followed bybreast and uterine cancers as well as breast and ovarian cancers. The overallrisk of second cancers was highest within the first 5 years after the diagnosisof primary cancer. The bidirectional relationships suggest common risk factorsamong these three female cancers. This is the largest cohort study to focus onthe bidirectional associations among hormone-related cancers in Asian women, and these results could aid in the development of early prevention strategies andfollow-up surveillance programs.© 2018 The Authors.
