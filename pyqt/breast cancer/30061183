[Epub ahead of print]LINK-A lncRNA promotes migration and invasion of ovarian carcinoma cells byactivating TGF-β pathway.Ma J(1), Xue M(2).Author information: (1)Xiangya Third Hospital, Changsha, China.(2)Xiangya Third Hospital, Changsha, China majiezhi@csu.edu.cn.Introduction LINK-A lncRNA is a well-characterized oncogenic lncRNA only intriple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our study was carried out to investigatethe possible involvement of LINK-A lncRNA in ovarian carcinoma. MethodsExpression of LINK-A in ovarian biopsies and plasma of both ovarian carcinomapatients and healthy females was detected by qRT-PCR. Plasma TGF-β1 was detected by ELISA. Correlation between plasma LINK-A and TGF-β1 was analyzed by Pearsoncorrelation analysis. Correlation between plasma LINK-A and patients'clinicopathological data was analyzed by Chi-square test. LINK-A overexpressionvector was transfected into cells of human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Cellmigration and invasion was detected by Transwell migration and invasion assay.TGF-β1 expression was detected by Western blot. Results We found that LINK-A and TGF-β1 were upregulated in ovarian carcinoma patients than in healthy controls.Plasma levels of LINK-A were positively correlated with plasma TGF-β1 in ovarian carcinoma patients but not in healthy controls. Plasma levels of LINK-A werecorrelated with distant tumor metastasis but not tumor size. LINK-Aoverexpression led to upregulated TGF-β1 in ovarian carcinoma cells and promoted cell migration and invasion. In contrast, TGF-β1 treatment showed no effects onLINK-A expression but attenuated the effects of LINK-A overexpression on cellmigration and invasion. Conclusions We conclude that LINK-A lncRNA may promotemigration and invasion of ovarian carcinoma cells by activating TGF-β pathway.©2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20180936 PMID: 30061183
