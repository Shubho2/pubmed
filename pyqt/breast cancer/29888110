China.Increasing evidences have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical regulatory roles in cancer biology. However, the contributions of lncRNAs tocolorectal cancer remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a lncRNA AFAP1-AS1that facilitates colorectal cancer, where it is upregulated. AFAP1-AS1 expressionwas associated with colorectal cancer patient survival. AFAP1-AS1 knockdowninhibited cell proliferation, cell cycle, and tumorigenesis in an subcutaneousmouse xenograft model system. Further data demonstrated that AFAP1-AS1 wasassociated with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and that this association was required for the repression of EZH2 target genes. Our findings indicate thatAFAP1-AS1 is an oncogenic lncRNA that promotes tumor progression and may be anovel prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. Targeting AFAP1-AS1 might be apotential therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer treatment.PMCID: PMC5992508PMID: 29888110
