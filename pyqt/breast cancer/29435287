Underlying primary tumours,clinical presentation, macroscopic appearance, treatment strategies and outcomeof secondary ampullary lesions have not been systematically analysed. The presentcase study reported a 57-year old patient with an ampullary metastasis from renalcancer and a literature review was performed in which a further 32 patients were included. The most common responsible primary tumours were malignant melanoma andrenal clear cell carcinoma, followed by breast cancer. The time interval between the diagnosis of the primary tumour and the ampullary metastasis was highlyvariable, and may be as long as 10 years, particularly for renal cancer. Patientsmay present with unspecific abdominal discomfort, jaundice or uppergastrointestinal bleeding. The gross appearance was largely indistinguishablefrom that of a primary tumour. Lesions may present as polypoid or irregular, softand friable tumour mass, in certain cases with superficial ulceration. In ~50% ofcases, the ampullary metastasis was the only metastatic lesion, while in theremaining cases, the cancer had spread to one or more organs. The prognosis wasgenerally poor. The management requires a multi-modal approach, includingendoscopic, surgical and oncological procedure.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2017.1535 PMCID: PMC5776421PMID: 29435287
