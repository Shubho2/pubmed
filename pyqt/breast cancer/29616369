Expression of Ki67, VEGFR-2, and CD31 in tumor tissue was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Non-parametric statistical testswere used to evaluate the relation between (R)-[11C]PAQ radiotracer uptake andtherapy response biomarkers.RESULTS: The (R)-[11C]PAQ SUVmax in tumors was significantly reduced after 4 daysin the B20-4.1.1/PTX combinational and B20-4.1.1 monotherapy groups (p < 0.0005and p < 0.003, respectively). No significant change was observed in the PTXmonotherapy group. There was a significant difference in the SUVmax changebetween the VEH group and B20-4.1.1/PTX combinational group, as well as betweenthe VEH group and the B20-4.1.1 monotherapy group (p < 0.05). MRI revealedsignificant decreases in TV in the B20-4.1.1/PTX treatment group (p < 0.005) but not the other therapy groups. A positive trend was observed between the(R)-[11C]PAQ SUVmax change and TV reduction in the B20-4.1.1/PTX group.Statistical testing showed a significant difference in the blood vessel densitybetween the B20-4.1.1/PTX combinational group and the VEH group (p < 0.05) but nosignificant difference in the Ki67 positive signal between treatment groups.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study are promising. However, additional studiesare necessary before (R)-[11C]PAQ can be approved as a predictive radiotracer forcancer therapy response.DOI: 10.1186/s13550-018-0380-x PMCID: PMC5882477PMID: 29616369
