Dr. Arnaldo, São Paulo, SP 251 Brazil.Metronomic therapy has been gaining importance in the neoadjuvant setting ofbreast cancer treatment. Its clinical benefits may involve antiangiogenicmachinery. Cancer cells induce angiogenesis to support tumor growth by secreting factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In breast cancer,Trastuzumab (TZM) based treatment is of key importance and is believed to reduce diameter and volume of blood vessels as well as vascular permeability. Here in weinvestigated serum levels of angiogenic factors VEGF and MCSF in patientsreceiving metronomic neoadjuvant therapy with or without TZM. We observed inHER2+ cohort stable levels of MCSF through treatment, whereas VEGF trend was ofdecreasing levels. In HER2- cohort we observed increasing levels of MCSF and VEGFtrend. Overall, HER2+ patients had better pathological response to treatment.These findings suggest that angiogenic pathway may be involved in TZManti-tumoral effect in the neoadjuvant setting.DOI: 10.1186/s40364-018-0135-x PMCID: PMC6001168PMID: 29946467
