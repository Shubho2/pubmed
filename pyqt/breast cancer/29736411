Identifying proteins that promote the outgrowth ofdisseminated tumor cells may provide opportunities for novel therapeuticstrategies. Despite multiple studies demonstrating that themesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) is critical for metastaticcolonization, key regulators that initiate this transition remain unknown. Weserially passaged lung metastases from a primary triple negative breast cancerxenograft to the mammary fat pads of recipient mice to enrich for gene expressionchanges that drive metastasis. An unbiased transcriptomic signature of potential metastatic drivers was generated, and a high throughput gain-of-function screenwas performed in vivo to validate candidates. Carcinoembryonic antigen-relatedcell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) was identified as a metastatic driver. CEACAM5overproduction enriched for an epithelial gene expression pattern and facilitatedtumor outgrowth at metastatic sites. Tissues from patients with metastatic breastcancer confirmed elevated levels of CEACAM5 in lung metastases relative to breasttumors, and an inverse correlation between CEACAM5 and the mesenchymal markervimentin was demonstrated. Thus, CEACAM5 facilitates tumor outgrowth atmetastatic sites by promoting MET, warranting its investigation as a therapeutic target and biomarker of aggressiveness in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0062-x PMCID: PMC5928229PMID: 29736411
