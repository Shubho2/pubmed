One such inhibitortested and which has ongoing clinical trials for breast cancer is abemaciclib.Abemaciclib is a molecular-targeted agent that targets basic cell cycleregulatory mechanisms. Areas covered: This review discusses the availableclinical data and ongoing clinical trials of abemaciclib in breast cancer. Expertopinion: Abemaciclib has demonstrated a clear anti-tumour effect and manageabletoxicity against HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer in many clinical trialsand is expected to be an important standard therapy. However, currently, besides oestrogen receptor expression, there is a definite lack of predictive biomarkers for response and/or tolerance to abemaciclib, which is important for patientselection. Another problem is that its contribution to overall survival (OS) has not been shown. And while two large the phase 3 study highlighted the anti-tumoureffect of abemaciclib, the OS results are awaited. Furthermore, the effect onbrain metastases is expected to be unique to abemaciclib as the response of brainmetastasis in HR-positive breast cancer patients has been confirmed in a fewcases with case collection still ongoing.DOI: 10.1080/14656566.2018.1448787 PMID: 29522364  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
