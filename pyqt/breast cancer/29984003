New dose and fractionation schemas have evolved and are available, each with unique risks and rewards. Current efforts are ongoing totailor radiotherapy to the unique biology of breast cancer. In this review, wediscuss our efforts to personalize radiotherapy dosing using genomic data and theimplications for future clinical trials. We also explore immune mechanisms thatmay contribute to a tumor's unique radiation sensitivity or resistance.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6729802 PMCID: PMC6015692PMID: 29984003
