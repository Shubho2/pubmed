However, acquisition of resistance totamoxifen in one third of patients presents a serious clinical problem. Polo-likekinase 1 (Plk1) is a key oncogenic regulator of completion of G2-M phase of thecell cycle. We assessed Plk1 expression in five chemoresistant cancer cell types and found that Plk1 and its downstream phosphatase Cdc25c were selectivelyoverexpressed in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 (TAMR-MCF-7) breast cancer cells.Real-time monitoring of cell proliferation also showed that TAMR-MCF-7 cells weremore sensitive to inhibition of cell proliferation by the ATP-competitive Plk1inhibitor BI2536 than were the parent MCF-7 cells. Moreover, BI2536 suppressedexpression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker proteins and 3D spheroidformation in TAMR-MCF-7 cells. Using TAMR-MCF-7 cell-implanted xenograft andspleen-liver metastasis models, we showed that BI2536 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in vivo Our results suggest that Plk1 could be a novel target for the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.
