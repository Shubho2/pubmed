The aim of this review is tosummarize meta-analyses, describing breast tissue stiffness and risk of breastcarcinoma (BC) assessing the potential relationship between matricellularproteins (MPs) and survival. A systematic computer-based search of publishedarticles, according to PRISMA statement, was conducted through Ovid interface.Mammographic density and tissue stiffness are associated with the risk of BCdevelopment, suggesting that MPs may influence BC prognosis. No definitiveconclusions are available and additional researches are required to definitively clarify the role of each MP, mammographic density and stiffness in BC developmentand the mechanisms involved in the onset of this malignancy.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-0510 PMID: 29939077
