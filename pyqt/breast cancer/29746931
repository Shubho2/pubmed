CD31 plays roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, andcellular immunity. CD31 is also expressed on tumor cells, such as breast cancercells and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and contributes to tumor cell invasion. Here, our experiments show that CD31 promotes metastasis by inducing theepithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma by up-regulatingintegrin β1 via the FAK/Akt signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
