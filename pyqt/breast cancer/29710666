Theanti-proliferative and cell death-inducing ability of the extract was analysedusing MCF-7 breast cancer cells. ATP and LDH levels, along with the cellmorphology were noted. The anti-proliferative ability of the extract was examinedin relation to pain and inflammation. Analgesic activity was determined using ahot plate, acetic acid and formalin-induced pain models in mice. Acuteanti-inflammatory activity was observed in carrageenan and egg albumin inducedpaw oedema in Wistar rats. Chronic inflammation was induced by placing a cottonpellet under the skin at the axial region of rats. Reduced ATP and increased LDH content indicated the cytotoxic effect of the extract. SCBM at 200 mg/kg dosedepicted good activity in acetic acid (77.69%) and formalin (80.81%) induced painmodels compared to the standard drug indomethacin. However, only a moderateactivity was observed in the hot plate method (53.85%). The higher dose of SCBMwas equally effective in anti-inflammatory models. The dose (200 mg/kg)significantly reduced the paw oedema in carrageenan (96.71%) and egg albuminmodels (54.24%) compared to the control. The chronic inflammation was alsoinhibited upto 70.46% by SCBM. These activities can be attributed to the phenoliccompounds detected in HPLC. The outcome of the study states that the extract can reduce both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions and kill the cancer cells, proposing the dual role of SCBM in treating inflammatory pains in cancer. Theresult of these studies indicated that wild plants like Syzygium calophyllifoliumcould be taken forward for a detailed study to accomplish the demand for a bettertreatment against diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
