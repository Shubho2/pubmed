The N-myc downstream regulated gene (NDRG1) gene plays a critical rolein peripheral nervous system myelination, as inactivating mutations cause severe demyelinating neuropathy. In breast cancer, elevated NDRG1 expression has beenlinked to clinical outcomes, but its functional role in breast cancer physiology has remained unclear.METHODS: A meta-analysis of NDRG1 expression in multiple large publicly availablegenomic databases was conducted. Genome-wide expression correlation and Coxproportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier modeling of clinical outcomes associatedwith elevated expression were assessed. To study NDRG1 function, gene silencingand overexpression phenotypic studies were carried out in a panel of cell linesrepresenting all major breast cancer molecular subtypes. Changes in cellproliferation, morphology, and neutral lipid accumulation due to altered NDRG1expression were assessed by high throughput, quantitative microscopy.Comprehensive lipidomics mass spectrometry was applied to characterize globalchanges in lipid species due to NDRG1 silencing. Labeled fatty acids were used tomonitor cellular fatty acid uptake and subcellular distribution under nutrientreplete and starvation culture conditions.RESULTS: NDRG1 overexpression correlated with glycolytic and hypoxia-associatedgene expression, and was associated with elevated rates of metastasis and patientmortality. Silencing NDRG1 reduced cell proliferation rates, causing lipidmetabolism dysfunction including increased fatty acid incorporation into neutral lipids and lipid droplets. Conversely, NDRG1 expression minimized lipid dropletformation under nutrient replete and starvation conditions.CONCLUSIONS: Here we report that NDRG1 contributes to breast canceraggressiveness by regulating the fate of lipids in cells that exhibit an altered lipid metabolic phenotype. In line with its role in promoting myelination and itsassociation with altered metabolism in cancer, our findings show that NDRG1 is a critical regulator of lipid fate in breast cancer cells. The association between NDRG1 and poor prognosis in breast cancer suggests it should play a moreprominent role in patient risk assessment. The function of NDRG1 in breast cancerlipid metabolism may represent a promising therapeutic approach in the future.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0980-4 PMCID: PMC6001025PMID: 29898756
