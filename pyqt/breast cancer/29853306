These cases were compared with 1290higher-risk biopsy cases with diverse clinical features from a prospectivegenomic registry.OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Average genomic risk (AGR) wasdetermined from 18 published prognostic signatures, and MSigDB hallmark gene setswere analyzed using bootstrapped clustering methods. These sets were examined in relation to clinical variables and pathological and biochemical outcomes usingmultivariable regression analysis.RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 408 (96%) biopsies passed RNA qualitycontrol. Based on AGR quartiles defined by the high-risk multicenter cases, theUniversity of California, San Francisco (UCSF) low-risk patients were distributedacross the quartiles as 219 (54%), 107 (26%), 61 (15%), and 21 (5%). Unsupervisedclustering analysis of the hallmark gene set scores revealed three clusters,which were enriched for the previously described PAM50 luminal A, luminal B, and basal subtypes. AGR, but not the clusters, was associated with both pathological (odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-1.58) and biochemicaloutcomes (hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.19-1.93). These results may underestimatewithin-prostate genomic heterogeneity.CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancers that are homogeneously low risk by traditionalcharacteristics demonstrate substantial diversity at the level of genomicexpression. Molecular substratification of low-risk prostate cancer will yield a better understanding of its divergent biology and, in the future may helppersonalize treatment recommendations.PATIENT SUMMARY: We studied the genomic characteristics of tumors from mendiagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer. We found three main subtypes of prostatecancer with divergent tumor biology, similar to what has previously been found inwomen with breast cancer. In addition, we found that genomic risk scores wereassociated with worse pathology findings and prostate-specific antigen recurrenceafter surgery. These results suggest even greater genomic diversity amonglow-risk patients than has previously been documented with more limitedsignatures.Copyright Â© 2018 European Association of Urology.
