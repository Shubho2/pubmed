This large single institutional retrospective study analyses the risk of SC in HL patients treated outside of clinical trialsover past decades.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive series of HL patients were analysed with medianfollow-up 12 years. Standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and absolute excess risk(AER) were calculated for site-specific risk of SC.RESULTS: In total of 871 patients (491 men; median age 34 years), chemotherapyalone, radiotherapy alone, and combined treatment underwent 36%, 40%, and 24%patients. 154 SC were found with significantly increased SIR = 2.9 and AER = 80.8for all cancers except of nonmelanoma-skin cancer. SC-related death occurred in71 patients (15% of those who died, 8% of whole cohort). The most common SC were lung (17.5% of all malignancies, SIR = 3.2), breast carcinoma (15.6%, SIR = 4.4),and haematological malignancy (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma SIR = 13.1; leukaemiaSIR = 5.8). For SC within radiation field, the highest AER was in breast(AER = 46.9), colorectal (AER = 22.8), and lung cancer (AER = 17).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HL are generally at great risk of developing SC, whichis significantly increased especially by the use of radiotherapy. We suggestedspecial follow-up schema for patients after initial HL treatment suitable fordaily real-world clinical practice. The system depends on gender, form of HLtreatment and especially the form of radiation therapy in terms of location ofradiation fields.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ijcp.13235 PMID: 30011112
