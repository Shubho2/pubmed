All case-control and cohort studies in addition to randomized clinical trials were included if they assessed the chemopreventive effects of GT on breastcancer. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawaand Jadad scale. This systematic review comprised 14 studies: 9 case-controlstudies, 4 cohort studies, and 1 clinical trial. Odds ratio (OR) in case-control studies suggested that women in the group receiving the highest level of GT had19% reduction in breast cancer risk compared with those who received the lowestlevel of GT (summary OR = 0.81, p = .031; 95% CI [0.66, 0.981]; heterogeneity, I2 = 71.53, p < .001, random effect model; 9 studies). OR in cohort studies alsoshowed no significant difference (OR = 0.99, p = .94; 95% CI [0.81, 1.138];heterogeneity, I2  = 19.06, p = .29; fixed-effect model; 4 studies). According tothe only clinical trial, treatment with GT could not alter the mammographicdensity compared with placebo (26% vs. 25%). It cannot be concluded that GTconsumption may decrease the risk of breast cancer. Due to high heterogeneity, a pooled analysis of case-control and cohort studies was not performed.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6124 PMID: 29876987
