Hydroxyprogesterone was meant torecapitulate the luteal phase of menstrual cycle in these women. We wanted tounderstand the molecular basis of action of hydroxyprogesterone on primary breasttumours in a peri-operative setting.METHODS: We performed whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) of primary breast tumour samples collected from patients before and after hydroxyprogesteroneexposure and controls. Paired breast cancer samples were obtained from patientswho were given hydroxyprogesterone before surgery and a group of patients whowere subjected to only surgery.RESULTS: A test of significance between the two groups revealed 207 significantlyaltered genes, after correction for multiple hypothesis testing. We foundsignificantly contrasting gene expression patterns in exposed versus unexposedgroups; 142 genes were up-regulated post-surgery among exposed patients, anddown-regulated post-surgery among unexposed patients. Significantly enrichedpathways included genes that respond to progesterone, cellular stress,nonsense-mediated decay of proteins and negative regulation of inflammatoryresponse. These results suggest that cellular stress is modulated byhydroxyprogesterone. Network analysis revealed that UBC, a mediator of stressresponse, to be a major node to which many of the significantly altered genesconnect.CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pre-operative exposure to progesteronefavourably modulates the effect of surgical stress, and this might underlie itsbeneficial effect when administered prior to surgery.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4749-3 PMID: 29564740
