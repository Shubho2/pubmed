We evaluated three approaches to training pathologistsin sub-Saharan Africa to perform pathologic cancer staging of breast, cervix,prostate, and colorectal cancers.Methods: One of three training methods was used at each workshop: didactic,case-based testing (CBT), or a blended approach. The project involved 52participants from 16 pathology departments in 11 countries in East, Central, and Southern Africa. Evaluation of each method included pre- and postworkshopknowledge assessments, online pre- and postworkshop surveys of practice changesat the individual and institutional levels, and selected site visits.Results: While CBT resulted in the highest overall average postassessmentindividual scores, both CBT and blended approaches resulted in 19% increases inaverage scores from pre- to postworkshop assessments. Institutions thatparticipated in the blended workshop had increased changes in practice asindicated by the institutional survey.Conclusions: Both CBT and a blended approach are effective methods for trainingpathologists in pathologic cancer staging. Both are superior to traditionallectures alone.DOI: 10.1093/ajcp/aqx158 PMID: 29471457
