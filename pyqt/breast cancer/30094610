[Epubahead of print]CXCL1 Derived from Mammary Fibroblasts Promotes Progression of Mammary Lesions toInvasive Carcinoma through CXCR2 Dependent Mechanisms.Bernard S(1), Myers M(1), Fang WB(1), Zinda B(1), Smart C(1), Lambert D(1), ZouA(1), Fan F(1), Cheng N(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.(2)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA. ncheng@kumc.edu.With improved screening methods, the numbers of abnormal breast lesions diagnosedin women have been increasing over time. However, it remains unclear whetherthese breast lesions will develop into invasive cancers. To more effectivelypredict the outcome of breast lesions and determine a more appropriate course of treatment, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms that regulate progression of non-invasive lesions to invasive breast cancers. A hallmark ofinvasive breast cancers is the accumulation of fibroblasts. Fibroblastproliferation and activation in the mammary gland is in part regulated by theTransforming Growth Factor beta1 pathway (TGF-β). In animal models, TGF-βsuppression of CCL2 and CXCL1 chemokine expression is associated with metastatic progression of mammary carcinomas. Here, we show that transgenic overexpressionof the Polyoma middle T viral antigen in the mouse mammary gland of C57BL/6 mice results in slow growing non-invasive lesions that progress to invasive carcinomasin a stage dependent manner. Invasive carcinomas are associated with accumulationof fibroblasts that show decreased TGF-β expression and high levels of CXCL1, butnot CCL2. Using co-transplant models, we show that decreased TGF-β signaling infibroblasts contribute to mammary carcinoma progression through enhancement ofCXCL1/CXCR2 dependent mechanisms. Using cell culture models, we show that CXCL1mediated mammary carcinoma cell invasion through NF-κB, AKT, Stat3 and p42/44MAPKdependent mechanisms. These studies provide novel mechanistic insight into theprogression of pre-invasive lesions and identify new stromal biomarkers, withimportant prognostic implications.DOI: 10.1007/s10911-018-9407-1 PMID: 30094610
