China.Mast cells have been demonstrated to accumulate around and within solid tumors ofnumerous types, and express a number of pro-angiogenic compounds, includingtryptase. They may serve an early role in angiogenesis within developing tumors. In the present study, the role and mechanism of tryptase in the activation ofendothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in breast cancer angiogenesis were evaluated.Human umbilical cord blood EPCs were isolated and cultured. MB-MDA-231 breastcancer cells were then pretreated with tryptase, and the conditioned medium wascollected. The effects of tryptase on the migratory and angiogenesis abilities ofEPCs were determined using wound-healing and tube formation assays, respectively.The effect of tryptase on the proliferation of EPCs was detected using a CellCounting Kit-8 assay. Alterations in proteinase activated receptor (PAR)-2,phosphorylated (p)-protein kinase B (AKT), p-extracellular signal-regulatedkinase (p-ERK) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2expression were analyzed, in tryptase or conditioned medium-treated EPCs, bywestern blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chainreaction. It was confirmed that the EPCs expressed PAR-2; and that tryptasetreatment promoted the migration and tube formation of EPCs. Treatment with aPAR-2 agonist had a similar effect to tryptase, whereas treatment with a tryptaseinhibitor, APC366, or a PAR-2 inhibitor, SAM 11, inhibited the effect of tryptasetreatment. Tryptase and PAR-2 agonists did not affect the rate of EPCproliferation. MB-MDA-231 cells also expressed PAR-2. Treatment with tryptase or conditioned medium increased the expression of PAR-2, p-AKT, p-ERK and VEGFR-2 inEPCs. In conclusion, tryptase activated EPCs via PAR-2-mediated AKT and ERKsignaling pathway activation, thereby enhancing angiogenesis in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8856 PMCID: PMC6036543PMID: 30008831
