[Epub ahead ofprint]GSK-3β promotes cell migration and inhibits autophagy by mediating the AMPKpathway in breast cancer.Guo L(1), Chen D(2), Yin X(3), Shu Q(2).Author information: (1)Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.(2)General Surgery, YouJiang Medical University for Nationalities, Guangxi,China.(3)Wound Regeneration and Vascular Surgery Department of the First AffiliatedHospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Guangxi, China.GSK-3β is a versatile protein kinase participating in many reactions. Currently, there is insufficient understanding of its influence on breast cancer (BC). Inorder to explore its influence on migration and invasion in BC, we investigatedits expression in BC cell lines using qRT-PCR and western blot (WB).Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to examine the potential of GSK-3β to predictclinical outcome in BC patients. GSK-3β knockdown was achieved using a shRNAplasmid vector in T47D cells. Our research explored the biological reactions and downstream pathways involved. We found excessive GSK-3β expression in BC tissues,which was correlated with worse clinicopathological parameters and clinicaloutcome. Progression of BC was suppressed by GSK-3β knockdown. Furthermore,suppression of GSK-3β function led to a noticeable decrease in ATP generation,and this was associated with stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)in T47D cells. Activation of AMPK, a typical sign of autophagy stimulation, wastriggered after suppression of GSK-3β function, in parallel with increasedgeneration of LC-3II. Our findings therefore indicate that GSK-3β participates inregulation of migration as well as stimulation of autophagy via mediatingactivation of the AMPK pathway. This suggests that GSK-3β has potential as apredictor of clinical outcome, and as a target for BC therapy.DOI: 10.3727/096504018X15323394008784 PMID: 30037362
