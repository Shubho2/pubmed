Electronic address: lacoutum@mskcc.org.Cytotoxic chemotherapies, molecularly targeted therapies, immunotherapies,radiotherapy, stem cell transplants, and endocrine therapies may lead to hairdisorders (including alopecia, hirsutism, hypertrichosis, pigmentary and texturalhair changes). The mechanisms underlying these changes are varied and remainincompletely understood, hampering the development of preventive or therapeuticguidelines. The psychosocial impact of chemotherapy -induced alopecia has beenwell-documented mainly in the oncology literature, however the effect of otheralterations such as radiation-induced alopecia, hirsutism, changes in hair color or texture on quality of life have not been described. This article reviewsclinically significant therapy-related hair disorders in cancer patients,underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, severity grading scales, patientreported quality of life instruments, management strategies, and futuretranslational research opportunities.Copyright Â© 2018.
