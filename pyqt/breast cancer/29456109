The complex etiology is attributed to many factors like heredity,cirrhosis, hepatitis infections or the dysregulation of the different molecularpathways. Nevertheless, the current treatment regimens have either severe sideeffects or tumors gradually acquire resistance upon prolonged use. Thus,developing a new selective treatment for HCC is the need of the hour. Manyanticancer agents derived from plants have been evaluated for their cytotoxicity towards many human cancer cell lines. Strigolactones (SLs)-a newly discoveredclass of phytohormones, play a crucial role in the development of plant-root and shoot. Recently, many synthetic analogues of SLs have demonstrated pro-apoptotic effects on different cancer cell lines like prostate, breast, colon and lung. In this study, we tested synthetic SLs analogues on HCC cell line-HepG2 andevaluated their capability to induce cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis.Primary WST-1 assays, followed by annexin-V/7AAD staining, demonstrated theanti-proliferative effects. The SLs analogues TIT3 and TIT7 were found tosignificantly reduce HepG2 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent mannerand induce apoptosis. Interestingly, though TIT3 and TIT7 strongly affectedcancer cell proliferation, both compounds showed moderate anti-proliferativeeffect on normal cells. Further, migration of cancer cells was suppressed upontreatment with TIT3 and TIT7 in a wound healing assay. In summary, these findingssuggest that two SLs analogues TIT3 and TIT7 exert selective inhibitory effectson cancer cells most likely through targeting microtubules. SLs analogues couldbe used in future as potential anti-cancer candidates in chemotherapy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2018.02.016 PMID: 29456109
