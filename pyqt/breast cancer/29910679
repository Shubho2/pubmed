In this study, weevaluated the role of DUSP1 and DUSP5, negative regulators of mitogen-activatedprotein kinase pathway, in the aggressiveness of BLBC. MDA-MB-231 cells weregiven paclitaxel (PTX) treatment and subsequently PTX resistant cell clones were established. Microarray analysis, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR (qRT-PCR), and online analysis of large cohorts of breast cancer patientswere performed. The PTX resistant cells showed stronger cell proliferationability by exhibiting the upregulation of CENPF, CDC6, MCM3, CLSPN and SMC1Aexpression. Furthermore, DUSP1 and DUSP5 expression was significantlydownregulated in PTX resistant cells. In addition, in large breast cancerpatients' database, both DUSP1 and DUSP5 correlated negatively with higherhistological grade. DUSP1 low expression was obvious in HER2 positive and basallike while DUSP5 low expression was peculiar for basal like compared with othersubtypes. Remarkably, low expression of DUSP5, but not DUSP1, was significantlycorrelated with poor survival of BLBC patients. In conclusion, our data suggestthat loss of DUSP5 expression results in PTX resistance and tumor progression,providing a rationale for a therapeutic agent that restores DUSP5 in BLBC.DOI: 10.7150/ijms.24981 PMCID: PMC6001410PMID: 29910679
