However, effective therapeutic strategies to prevent metastasis are still lacking. Decorin is a natural inhibitor oftransforming growth factor β (TGF-β) which plays pivotal role in tumormetastasis. We have previously developed an oncolytic adenovirus expressingdecorin, rAd.DCN. In immune-competent breast tumor (4T1) model, intratumoral aswell as intravenous delivery of rAd.DCN inhibited growth of orthotopic tumors andspontaneous lung metastasis. We showed that intratumoral delivery of rAd.DCNproduced higher levels of transgene expression and evoked stronger oncolysis ofthe tumors compared to the intravenous delivery. However, intravenous deliveryresulted in higher amount of virus accumulation in lungs and produced strongerresponses to prevent tumor lung metastasis. Oncolytic adenoviral-mediated decorinexpression in the tumors down-regulated the decorin-target genes, and decreasedepithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Decorin expression in lungtissues also increased Th1 cytokines expression, such as interleukin(IL)-2, IL-12and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and decreased Th2 cytokines, such as TGF-βand IL-6. Moreover, rAd.DCN treatment induced strong systemic inflammatoryresponses and up-regulated CD8+ T lymphocytes. In conclusion, rAd.DCN inhibit thetumor growth and lung metastasis of breast cancer might via regulatingwnt/β-catenin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Met pathways, andmodulating the anti-tumor inflammatory and immune responses. Considering thatintravenous delivery was much more effective in preventing lung metastasis,systemic delivery of rAd.DCN might be a promising strategy to treat breast cancerlung metastasis.DOI: 10.1089/hum.2018.055 PMID: 30032645
