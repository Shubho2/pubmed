Electronic address: clines@umich.edu.Bone metastasis is a complication of advanced breast and prostate cancer.Tumor-secreted Dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1), an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signalingand osteoblast differentiation, was proposed to regulate the osteoblasticresponse to metastatic cancer in bone. The objectives of this study were tocompare DKK1 expression with the in vivo osteoblastic response in a panel ofbreast and prostate cancer cell lines, and to discover mechanisms that regulatecancer DKK1 expression. DKK1 expression was highest in MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cellsthat produce osteolytic lesions, and hence a suppressed osteoblastic response, inanimal models of bone metastasis. LnCaP, C4-2B, LuCaP23.1, T47D, ZR-75-1, MCF-7, ARCaP and ARCaPM cancer cells that generate osteoblastic, mixed or no bonelesions had the lowest DKK1 expression. The cell lines with negligibleexpression, LnCaP, C4-2B and T47D, exhibited methylation of the DKK1 promoter.Canonical Wnt signaling activity was then determined and found in all cell lines tested, even in the MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cell lines despite sizeable amounts ofDKK1 protein expression expected to block canonical Wnt signaling. A mechanism ofDKK1 resistance in the osteolytic cell lines was investigated and determined tobe at least partially due to down-regulation of the DKK1 receptors Kremen1 andKremen2 in the MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cell lines. Combined DKK1 and Kremen expressionin cancer cells may serve as predictive markers of the osteoblastic response ofbreast and prostate cancer bone metastasis.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.tranon.2018.04.013 PMCID: PMC6051964PMID: 29772510
