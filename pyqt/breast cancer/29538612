However, the mechanism remains elusive. MicroRNA 320 (miR-320) downregulation has been reported in various types of cancers, and it may regulateAQP1 expression. In this study, miR-320 and AQP1 expressions were investigated byquantitative reverse transcription-PCR, in situ hybridization, andimmunohistochemistry. The clinicopathological implications of these moleculeswere also analyzed. We found that miR-320 expression is downregulated in bothplasma and tumor tissue in human breast cancer patients. Survival analysis showedthat reduced expression of miR-320 and overexpression of AQP1 are associated withworse prognosis. Luciferase assays showed that miR-320 negatively regulates AQP1 expression. In addition, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion assays were performed to investigate the effects of miR-320 on breast cancer cells. Ourresults showed that miR-320 overexpression inhibits cell proliferation,migration, and invasion in breast cancer cells by downregulating AQP1. Theseobservations suggested that miR-320 downregulation may enhance AQP1 expression inbreast cancer, favoring tumor progression. Our findings indicated that miR-320and AQP1 may serve as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in thetreatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1093/abbs/gmy023 PMID: 29538612
