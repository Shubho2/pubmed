Here,we present 5-year results of patient-reported quality of life.METHODS: We did this randomised controlled phase 3 trial at 16 hospitals andmedical centres in seven European countries. Patients aged 40 years or older with0-IIA breast cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) after breast-conserving surgery (resection margins ≥2 mm) to receive either whole-breast irradiation of 50 Gywith a boost of 10 Gy or APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy. Randomisationwas stratified by study centre, tumour type, and menopausal status, with a block size of ten and an automated dynamic algorithm. There was no masking of patients or investigators. The primary endpoint of the trial was ipsilateral localrecurrence. Here, we present 5-year results of quality of life (a prespecifiedsecondary endpoint). Quality-of-life questionnaires (European Organisation forResearch and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30, breast cancer module QLQ-BR23) werecompleted before radiotherapy (baseline 1), immediately after radiotherapy(baseline 2), and during follow-up. We analysed the data according to treatmentreceived (as-treated population). Recruitment was completed in 2009, andlong-term follow-up is continuing. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,number NCT00402519.FINDINGS: Between April 20, 2004, and July 30, 2009, 633 patients had acceleratedpartial breast irradiation and 551 patients had whole-breast irradiation.Quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline 1 were available for 334 (53%) of 663 patients in the APBI group and 314 (57%) of 551 patients in the whole-breastirradiation group; the response rate was similar during follow-up. Global health status (range 0-100) was stable in both groups: at baseline 1, APBI group meanscore 65·5 (SD 20·6) versus whole-breast irradiation group 64·6 (19·6), p=0·37;at 5 years, APBI group 66·2 (22·2) versus whole-breast irradiation group 66·0(21·8), p=0·94. The only moderate, significant difference (difference of 10-20points) between the groups was found in the breast symptoms scale. Breast symptomscores were significantly higher (ie, worse) after whole-breast irradiation than after APBI at baseline 2 (difference of means 13·6, 95% CI 9·7-17·5; p<0·0001)and at 3-month follow-up (difference of means 12·7, 95% CI 9·8-15·6; p<0·0001).INTERPRETATION: APBI with multicatheter brachytherapy was not associated withworse quality of life compared with whole-breast irradiation. This findingsupports APBI as an alternative treatment option after breast-conserving surgery for patients with early breast cancer.FUNDING: German Cancer Aid.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
