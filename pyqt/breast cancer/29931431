[Epub ahead ofprint]Imaging Cobalamin Uptake within Malignant Breast Tumors In Vivo.Collins DA(1).Author information: (1)Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.collins.douglas@mayo.edu.PURPOSE: To image the uptake of cobalamin (Cbl) within malignant breast tumors invivo.PROCEDURES: Prior to surgery 20 female patients with clinically suspected breast tumors were intravenously administered 0.25 μg of an In-111 labeled5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AC) analog ([111In]AC) and sequentially imaged withwhole-body planar (WBP) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)between 2-5 h and 20-24 h post-injection (P.I.). The tumor to background (T/B)ratio for [111In]AC in breast tumors at 2-5 h was correlated to its expression ofestrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)receptors. Subsequent pulse chase (PC) experiments in nude mice burdened with theMDA-MB-231 triple-negative (TN) breast tumor xenograft measured the effect thatpulses of AC or dexamethasone (DEX) had on [111In]AC uptake in both normal murinetissue and the TN breast tumor.RESULTS: The mean [111In]AC T/B ratio of the patients' 18 resected tumors was5.8. Comparing ER- and PR-positive tumors (n = 11) to TN and HER2-positive tumors(n = 7), the mean [111In]AC T/B ratios at 2-5 h P.I. were 3.2 (range 1.8-5.6) and10.4 (range 3.3-22.5), respectively. Pulses of 2.0 μg of AC at 2, 8, or 24 h; or 40.0 μg of DEX at 24 h prior to injecting 0.5 μg of [111In]AC, increased meantracer uptake in the MDA-MB-231 tumors by 26.4, 71.5, 92.6, and 49.1 %,respectively. Only the 2- and 24-h PC intervals concomitantly suppressed[111In]AC uptake in normal murine tissue while enhancing [111In]AC uptake inMDA-MB-231 tumors.CONCLUSION: The uptake of Cbl within malignant breast tumors can be imagedclinically. Cbl uptake is greatest in TN and HER2-positive breast tumors. Asolitary bolus of AC or DEX increases the [111In]AC uptake within a breast tumor in vivo. Investigating the cytogenetic mechanisms controlling the endocytosis of Cbl in malignant breast tumors is warranted.DOI: 10.1007/s11307-018-1232-9 PMID: 29931431
