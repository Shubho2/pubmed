The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinicopathological features andclinical outcomes of microinvasive carcinoma compared with pure DCIS.Methods: We assessed 613 cases of DCIS and microinvasive carcinoma that wereconsecutively resected from 2003 to 2014 and analyzed clinicopathologicalvariables, expression of standard biomarkers such as the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), p53,and Ki-67, and tumor recurrence.Results: Among the 613 cases, 136 (22.2%) were classified as microinvasivecarcinoma. Microinvasive carcinoma was significantly associated with DCIS with a large extent, high nuclear grade, necrosis, and comedotype architectural pattern.ER and PR expressions were dominantly observed in pure DCIS, whereas positiveHER2 status, p53 overexpression, and high Ki-67 proliferation indices were morefrequently observed in microinvasive carcinoma. Lymph node metastasis was foundin only four cases of microinvasive carcinoma with multifocal microinvasion. Inthe multivariate analysis, DCIS with a large extent, comedo-type architecturalpattern, and negative ER status were found to be independent predictors ofmicroinvasion. During follow-up, 12 patients had ipsilateral breast recurrence,and no differences in recurrence rates were observed between patients with DCISand those with microinvasive carcinoma. The triple-negative subtype was the only factor that was associated with tumor recurrence.Conclusion: Microinvasive carcinomas are distinct from DCIS in terms ofclinicopathological features and biomarker expressions but are similar to DCIS interms of clinical outcomes. Our results suggest that microinvasive carcinoma can be treated and followed up as pure DCIS.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.197 PMCID: PMC6015981PMID: 29963116
