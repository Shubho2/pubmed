[Epub ahead ofprint]Surface-Modified Macrophages Facilitate Tracking of Breast Cancer-ImmuneInteractions.Joshi BP(1), Hardie J(1), Mingroni MA(1), Farkas ME(1).Author information: (1)Department of Chemistry , University of Massachusetts , 710 North PleasantStreet , Amherst , Massachusetts 01003 , United States.The immune system has been found to play key roles in cancer development andprogression. Macrophages are typically considered to be pro-inflammatory cellsbut can also facilitate pro-oncogenic activities via associations with tumors andmetastases. The study of macrophages and their interactions within the context ofcancer microenvironments is stymied by the lack of a system to track them. Wepresent a cell-based strategy for studying cancer-immune cell interactions bychemically modifying the surfaces of macrophages with fluorophores. Two widelyused methods are employed, affecting cell surface proteins and glycans viaNHS-ester and Staudinger ligation reactions, respectively. We show that thesemodifications do not interfere with macrophage responses to chemoattractants and that interactions with cancer cells can be readily monitored. This work describesthe development of macrophage-based imaging agents for tumor detection andassessment of interactions between immune cells and cancers.DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00509 PMID: 29856604
