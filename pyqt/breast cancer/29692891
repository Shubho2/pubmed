Apart from the rare congenital cases, this condition isusually a result of technical complications during breast augmentationsurgery.This article describes a simple and reliable method for correctingsymmastia.Methods: From November 2006 to June 2015, we treated 10 patients with acquiredsymmastia who had previously undergone an implant-based reconstruction. Weperformed a crescent-shape medial capsulectomy and we then performed an adequate and resistant closure with a substitute device, consisting of a Tuohy epiduralneedle and polydioxanone sutures, which are easily accessible and inexpensive.The process outcome was successful and resulted in a normal cleavage between the breasts.Results: Mean follow-up was 24 months. We haven't observed any recurrence ofsymmastia to date in this study. One postoperative hematoma and one seromaoccurred. All ten patients achieved acceptable results through the procedure.Conclusion: Our pericapsular Tuohy technique for medial closure of the pocket is a practical and efficient substitute to traditional capsulorraphy and providesreliable and reproducible results.DOI: 10.1016/j.amsu.2018.03.024 PMCID: PMC5911666PMID: 29692891
