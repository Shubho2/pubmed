[Epub ahead of print]Upregulation of miR-374a promotes tumor metastasis and progression bydownregulating LACTB and predicts unfavorable prognosis in breast cancer.Zhang J(1), He Y(2), Yu Y(2), Chen X(2), Cui G(2), Wang W(3), Zhang X(1), LuoY(4), Li J(1)(2), Ren F(4), Ren Z(1)(2), Sun R(1)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University,Zhengzhou, China.(2)Precision Medicine Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of ZhengzhouUniversity, Zhengzhou, China.(3)Department of Pathology, The First Affiliated Hospital of ZhengzhouUniversity, Zhengzhou, China.(4)Key Laboratory of Clinical Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital ofZhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.Breast cancer (BRCA) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death amongfemale worldwide. Recent studies have revealed that LACTB was frequentlyrepressed and functioned as a bona fide new tumor suppressor in a series ofcancers, including BRCA. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LACTBdysregulation in BRCA have not been reported. In the present study, we find that LACTB is repressed in BRCA and associated with poor prognosis by BRCA tissuemicroarray (TMA) analysis. Moreover, we confirm that LACTB is a direct target of miR-374a, which is significantly overexpressed and associated with malignanciesin BRCA. Mechanistically, applying loss-of-function and gain-of-functionapproaches in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments show that miR-374aknockdown suppresses the cell proliferative and colony formation activity, aswell as migration and invasion capacity, but LACTB silencing in these cellsreverses this change. Furthermore, we find that miR-374a silencing markedlyreduces the tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. In summary, our findingssuggest the miR-374a/LACTB axis plays a critical role in the tumorigenicity andprogression of BRCA. miR-374a/LACTB axis may be a potential target in thedevelopment of therapeutic strategies for BRCA patients.Â© 2018 The Authors.
