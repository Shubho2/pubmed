China.Due to lack of systematic reviews, BRCA, DNA Repair Associated (BRCA) mutationsin the Chinese population are not completely understood. The following studyinvestigates the prevalence and type of BRCA mutations in Chinese patients withhigh hereditary risk of breast cancer (BC). Patients Drwere recruited from 14cities between October 2015 and February 2016, and were selected based on family and personal medical history. BRCA mutations were analyzed by collecting bloodsamples from all participants. 437 BC patients were included. A total ofseventy-six (17.4%) mutation carriers were identified with no geographicdifference. The mutation rate in the early-onset BC patients was lower comparedto family history of breast/ovarian cancer (OC), bilateral BC, male BC, BC&OC or meeting â‰¥2 criteria (9.2 vs. 21.7, 24.0, 22.2, 16.7 and 24.3%, respectively,P=0.007). A total of 61 mutation sites were identified (BRCA1 32, BRCA2 29)including 47.5% novel sites and extra 10 variants of uncertain significance. Atotal of five sites were repeated in more than one unrelated patient. A total of 11 sites were associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, two of which were confirmed by family pedigrees. Compared with BRCA- patients,patients with BRCA1 mutation tended to be triple-negative BC (P<0.001), whereaspatients with BRCA2 mutation were more likely to be hormone receptor positive BC (P=0.02). The present study provides a general BRCA mutation profile in theChinese population. The prevalence of BRCA mutation in BC patients with highhereditary risk is lower compared with Western populations. Chinese mutation typeis different with Western people, without obvious founder mutation.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8538 PMCID: PMC5958635PMID: 29805665
