Accordingly, the issue ofincorrect identification of recombination events that can induce the distortionof multi-allelic or hemizygous variants has received more attention. However, thepotential distorted calculation bias or significance of a detected association ina GWAS due to the coexistence of CNVs and SNPs in the same genomic region mayremain under-recognized. Here we performed the association study within acongenital scoliosis (CS) cohort whose genetic etiology was recently elucidatedas a compound inheritance model, including mostly one rare variant deletion CNVnull allele and one common variant non-coding hypomorphic haplotype of the TBX6gene. We demonstrated that the existence of a deletion in TBX6 led to anoverestimation of the contribution of the SNPs on the hypomorphic allele.Furthermore, we generalized a model to explain the calculation bias, or distortedsignificance calculation for an association study, that can be 'induced' by CNVs at a locus. Meanwhile, overlapping between the disease-associated SNPs frompublished GWAS and common CNVs (overlap 10%) and pathogenic/likely pathogenicCNVs (overlap 99.69%) was significantly higher than the random distribution(p < 1 × 10-6 and p = 0.034, respectively), indicating that such co-existence of CNV and SNV alleles might generally influence data interpretation and potentialoutcomes of a GWAS. We also verified and assessed the influence of colocalizingCNVs to the detection sensitivity of disease-associated SNP variant alleles inanother adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) genome-wide association study. Weproposed that detecting co-existent CNVs when evaluating the association signals between SNPs and disease traits could improve genetic model analyses and betterintegrate GWAS with robust Mendelian principles.DOI: 10.1007/s00439-018-1910-3 PMID: 30019117
