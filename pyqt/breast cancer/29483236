However, controversy stillexists regarding overall lifetime risks of cancer in individuals testingpositive.METHODS: We assessed the penetrance of BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1 and MSH2 mutations inmen and women using Bayesian calculations based on ratios of positive to negativepresymptomatic testing by 10-year age cohorts. Mutation position was alsoassessed for BRCA1/BRCA2. RESULTS: Using results from 2264 presymptomatic testsin first-degree relatives (FDRs) of mutation carriers in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and 646 FDRs of patients with MMR mutations, we assessed overall associated cancerpenetrance to age of 68 years as 73% (95% CI 61% to 82%) for BRCA1, 60% (95% CI49% to 71%) for BRCA2, 95% (95% CI 76% to 99%) for MLH1% and 61% (95% CI 49% to76%) for MSH2. There was no evidence for significant penetrance for males inBRCA1 or BRCA2 families and males had equivalent penetrance to females with Lynchsyndrome. Mutation position and degree of family history influenced penetrance inBRCA2 but not BRCA1. CONCLUSION: We describe a new method for assessingpenetrance in cancer-prone syndromes. Results are in keeping with publishedprospective series and present modern-day estimates for overall diseasepenetrance that bypasses retrospective series biases.Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
