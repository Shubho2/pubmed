The median overallsurvival (OS) was 22.5 and 35 months for p95-HER2 positive and negative patients,respectively (p = 0.036) and the median time to metastases was 14 and 21 months, respectively (p = 0.006). There was a statistically significant associationbetween positive p95-HER2 expression and negative hormonal receptors expression(p = 0.004), high Ki-67 expression (p < 0.001) and development of visceralmetastasis (p = 0.034).CONCLUSION: Expression of p95-HER2 in HER2-positive BC patients is significantly associated with negative hormonal receptors expression, high Ki-67 expression,presence of visceral metastases and worse overall survival. A larger study isrequired to confirm its association with different prognostic factors and itseffect on survival.Copyright © 2018.
