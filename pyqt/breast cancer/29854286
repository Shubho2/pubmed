Synthetic interference peptides - comprising acell-penetrating peptide/nuclear localisation sequence and the Engrailed1-specific sequence from the N-terminus have been engineered to produce a strong apoptotic response in tumour cells overexpressing EN1, with no toxicity to normalor non Engrailed 1-expressing cells. Here scaled molecular dynamics simulationswere used to study the conformational dynamics of these interference peptides in aqueous solution to characterise their structure and dynamics. Transitions fromdisordered to Î±-helical conformation, stabilised by hydrogen bonds andproline-aromatic interactions, were observed throughout the simulations. Thebackbone of the wild-type peptide folds to a similar conformation as that foundin ternary complexes of anterior Hox proteins with conserved hexapeptide motifsimportant for recognition of pre-B-cell leukemia Homeobox 1, indicating that the motif may possess an intrinsic preference for helical structure. The predictedNMR chemical shifts of these peptides are consistent with the Hox hexapeptides insolution and Engrailed 2 NMR data. These findings highlight the importance ofaromatic residues in determining the structure of Engrailed 1 interferencepeptides, shedding light on the rational design strategy of molecules that could be adopted to inhibit other transcription factors overexpressed in other cancertypes, potentially including other transcription factor families that requirehighly conserved and cooperative protein-protein partnerships for biologicalactivity.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25025 PMCID: PMC5976472PMID: 29854286
