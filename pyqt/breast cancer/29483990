Marconi", Rome, Italy.Anastrozole is a non-selective aromatase inhibitor for adjuvant breast cancertherapy in postmenopausal women. Cutaneous adverse events have been reported. We observed a 64-year-old female patient with a medical history of locally advanced breast cancer of her right breast that was treated with radiotherapy and adjuvantdrug therapy with anastrozole. She developed a segmental bullous eruption limitedto the cancer-affected breast. Cessation of the aromatase inhibitor and systemic therapy with prednisolone cleared the lesions completely. This is the firstreport of a segmental erythema multiforme like drug eruption by anastrozole andanother example of the concept of the immunocompromised district of skin.DOI: 10.3889/oamjms.2018.026 PMCID: PMC5816324PMID: 29483990
