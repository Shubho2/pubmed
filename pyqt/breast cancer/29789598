Alterations in the tumour microenvironment can triggersignalling pathways in dormant cells leading to their proliferation. However,processes involved in the initial and the long-term survival of disseminateddormant BC cells remain largely unknown. Here we show that autophagy is acritical mechanism for the survival of disseminated dormant BC cells.Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of autophagy in dormant BC cells results insignificantly decreased cell survival and metastatic burden in mouse and human 3Din vitro and in vivo preclinical models of dormancy. In vivo experiments identifyautophagy gene autophagy-related 7 (ATG7) to be essential for autophagyactivation. Mechanistically, inhibition of the autophagic flux in dormant BCcells leads to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and reactive oxygenspecies (ROS), resulting in cell apoptosis.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04070-6 PMCID: PMC5964069PMID: 29789598
