Postoperative complications such as infection,capsular contracture, implant loss are more common in patients who receiveadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) than those who do not. Satisfaction levels in patientsis still a controversial issue. Therefore, we wanted to investigate our patientpopulation for the effects of RT and planned a study evaluating the satisfaction rates of our patients who received implants.Material and methods: Seventy five breast cancer patients who went throughmastectomy and went through reconstruction using expanders or silicone implantswere surveyed. Complication and cosmetic satisfaction rates were separatelycompared between irradiated and nonirradiated implants. Responses of 46 patients who answered the survey were analyzed using χ2 test and Mann Whitney U test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: Thirty-one of the patients received adjuvant RT and 15 did not receiveRT (NRT). There was no difference between the RT and NRT groups in the terms oftouch, size, shape of silicones, pain and satisfaction level in look of clothing.Only satisfaction in symmetry was significantly lower in the RT group than in theNRT group (p = 0.02). Additionally, patients receiving chemotherapy were lesssatisfied with silicone size than those who did not (p = 0.02).Conclusion: We did not find negative effects, other than symmetry, of adjuvantradiotherapy in breast cancer patients who underwent reconstructive surgery interms of cosmetic satisfaction.DOI: 10.5114/wo.2018.74390 PMCID: PMC5909727PMID: 29692660
