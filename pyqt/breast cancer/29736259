A shared decision-making approach has been adopted by our service, where patients play an active role in panel selection and we sought to identify factors associated with panel selection and report testing outcomes. Demographic and clinical data were gathered for female breast and/or ovariancancer patients aged 21 and over who underwent panel testing. Panel type wasclassified as 'breast cancer panel' (BCP) or 'multi-cancer panel' (MCP). Stepwisemultiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify clinical factors most predictive of panel selection. Of the 265 included subjects, the vast majorityselected a broader MCP (81.5%). Subjects who chose MCPs were significantly morelikely to be ≥50 years of age (49 vs. 31%; p < 0.05), Chinese (76 vs. 47%;p < 0.001) and have a personal history of ovarian cancer (41 vs. 8%; p < 0.001)with the latter two identified as the best predictors of panel selection. Family history of cancer was not significantly associated with panel selection. Therewere no statistically significant differences in result outcomes between the two groups. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the majority of patients have apreference for interrogating a larger number of genes beyond those withestablished testing guidelines, despite the additional likelihood of uncertainty.Individual factors, including cancer history and ethnicity, are the bestpredictors of panel selection.DOI: 10.1038/s41525-018-0050-y PMCID: PMC5923203PMID: 29736259
