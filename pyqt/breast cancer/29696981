However, the high costand risks of ionizing radiation for several molecular imaging modalities haveprevented a feasible and scalable approach for screening. Clinical studies havedemonstrated the ability to detect breast tumors using nonspecific probes such asindocyanine green, but the lack of molecular information and required intravenouscontrast agent does not provide a significant benefit over current noninvasiveimaging techniques. Here we demonstrate that negatively charged sulfate groups,commonly used to improve solubility of near-infrared fluorophores, enablesufficient oral absorption and targeting of fluorescent molecular imaging agents for completely noninvasive detection of diseased tissue such as breast cancer.These functional groups improve the pharmacokinetic properties of affinityligands to achieve targeting efficiencies compatible with clinical imagingdevices using safe, nonionizing radiation (near-infrared light). Together, thisenables development of a "disease screening pill" capable of oral absorption and systemic availability, target binding, background clearance, and imaging atclinically relevant depths for breast cancer screening. This approach should beadaptable to other molecular targets and diseases for use as a new class ofscreening agents.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00994 PMCID: PMC5941251PMID: 29696981
