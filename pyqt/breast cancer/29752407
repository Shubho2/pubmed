We hypothesized that DAAM1 mediatesinvadopodia extension and cell haptotaxis in response to type IV collagen inassociation with integrin receptors. Using Boyden chamber membranes coated withtype IV collagen, we show here that type IV collagen activates both DAAM1 and Rashomolog family member A (RHOA) and promotes haptotaxis of MDA-MB-231 andMDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, a process abolished by treatment with theintegrin αvβ3 inhibitor cyclo(-RGDfK). shRNA-mediated knockdown of DAAM1 or adominant-negative DAAM1 mutation (N-DAAM1) significantly decreasedcollagen-induced RHOA activity and the assembly of stress fibers, invadopodiaextension, and cell haptotaxis. Immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays revealed that integrin αvβ3 is associated with, but only indirectly binds to, theC-terminal DAD domain of DAAM1 in mammalian cells. Blockade of RHOA activationwith a specific inhibitor (CCG-1423) or via a dominant-negative RHOA mutation(RHOA-N19) suppressed collagen-induced invadopodia extension and haptotaxis ofthe MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assaysindicated high DAAM1 and RHOA expression in invadopodia, which was abolished bycyclo(-RGDfK) treatment or DAAM1 knockdown. These findings have uncovered anintegrin αvβ3/DAAM1/RHOA signaling pathway for type IV collagen-inducedinvadopodia extension and haptotaxis in breast cancer cells. Targeting thispathway may be a means for reducing invasiveness and metastasis of breast cancer.© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.000327 PMCID: PMC6028947 [Available on 2019-06-29]PMID: 29752407
