Electronic address: zhjl@imm.ac.cn.Bi qi capsule (BQC) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that isclinically used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Strychnine andbrucine, as two typical kinds of alkaloids, are the primary active and neurotoxicconstituents of BQC. In this study, a sensitive and reliable rapid resolutionliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RRLC-MS/MS) quantitative methodwas used to determine the concentrations of brucine and strychnine in rat brainand blood dialysates. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of free brucineand strychnine and their pharmacokinetic characteristics were investigated by thevalidated RRLC-MS/MS method coupled with in vivo microdialysis for the firsttime. The dialysate brain-blood AUC ratios of brucine were 0.098, 0.44 and 0.40respectively at 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 g kg-1 doses of BQC, and the dialysatebrain-blood AUC ratios of strychnine were 0.20, 1.25 and 2.06 respectively at0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 g kg-1 doses of BQC. The high brain-blood AUC ratios of brucine and strychnine were observed in medium and high dose groups of BQC. In addition, the effects of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) on brucine and strychnine across BBB were also studied using the above method as well as molecular docking. The results prompted that brucine was the substrate ofP-gp, and strychnine might be the inhibitor of P-gp. Brucine and strychnineshowed high brain penetration, so it is very important to well control the clinicdosage of BQC and manufactory quality for avoiding the side effects and obtaininggood therapeutic efficacy. Our study could be further used in investigating BBBpenetration for other drugs caused neurotoxicity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
