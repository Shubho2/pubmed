Anti-PD-L1 mAb was radiolabeled withiodine-131 (131 I-PD-L1 mAb) and was characterized in vitro. Biodistribution and imaging in vivo were performed periodically. Therapy study was conducted intriple-negative breast cancer-bearing BALB/c mice. As results, the labelingefficiencies of 131 I-PD-L1 mAb reached 80% ± 3%, with radiochemical purity of97% ± 1%. 131 I-PD-L1 mAb preserved the capacity to bind living PD-L1-expressing cells specifically in vitro. Tumor radioactivity uptake of 131 I-PD-L1 mAb wassignificantly higher than that of control groups. The xenografts were clearlyimaged from 48 to 72 hours noninvasively after injection of 131 I-PD-L1 mAb,while the xenografts were not imaged in control groups. Tumor growth wassignificantly inhibited, and median survival time was remarkably prolonged incombination therapy group compared with control groups. It was concluded that 131I-PD-L1 mAb can be a potential theranostic candidate for visualizing of PD-L1expression noninvasively and performing synergistic therapy in carcinomas.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/jlcr.3650 PMID: 29923634
