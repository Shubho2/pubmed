Also, there is abundant research linking coping strategies to cancer patients' quality of life. However, there exists a paucityof information on the moderating effect of coping styles on the relationshipbetween uncertainty and quality of life in cancer patients.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether uncertainty in illness isnegatively correlated with quality of life and whether this relationship ismoderated by coping strategies, namely, problem-focused, avoidant, and activeemotional coping.METHODS: A convenience sample of 135 Malaysian women with breast cancerparticipated in the study. Participants completed measures of uncertainty inillness, quality of life, and coping styles.RESULTS: Uncertainty in breast cancer was negatively related to quality of life(β = -0.379, P < .001), and active emotional coping was found to moderate thisnegative relationship (β = 0.155, P < .05). The model explained 22.20% of thevariance of quality of life.CONCLUSION: Lack of information about breast cancer, treatment, hospitalization, and disease recurrence is related to poorer quality of life. However, thisnegative relationship becomes weaker when active emotional coping strategies are used.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses and health providers should help patientsreduce their uncertainty in illness by providing them information on breastcancer or referring them to relevant sources. Moreover, they could reduce thedeleterious effect of uncertainty on quality of life by encouraging patients touse more active emotional coping strategies.DOI: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000552 PMID: 29489477
