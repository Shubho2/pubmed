Previous studies suggest preeclampsia may beassociated with a decreased risk of subsequent breast cancer and hyperemesis withan increased risk, but the evidence remains unclear. We used data from theGenerations Study, a large prospective study of women in the United Kingdom, toestimate relative risks of breast cancer in relation to a history of preeclampsiaand hyperemesis using Cox regression adjusting for known breast cancer riskfactors. During 7.5 years average follow-up of 82,053 parous women, 1,969 werediagnosed with invasive or in situ breast cancer. Women who had experiencedpreeclampsia during pregnancy had a significantly decreased risk of premenopausalbreast cancer (hazard ratio (HR) =0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.90) and of HER2-enriched tumours (HR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.12-0.91), but there was noassociation with overall (HR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80-1.02) or postmenopausal(HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.85-1.12) breast cancer risk. Risk reductions amongpremenopausal women were strongest within 20 years since the last pregnancy with preeclampsia. Hyperemesis was associated with a significantly increased risk ofHER2-enriched tumours (HR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.07-2.87), but not with otherintrinsic subtypes or breast cancer risk overall. These results provide evidence that preeclampsia is associated with a decreased risk of premenopausal andHER2-enriched breast cancer and that hyperemesis, although not associated withbreast cancer risk overall, may be associated with raised risk of HER2-enrichedtumours.© 2018 The Authors International Journal of Cancer published by John Wiley & SonsLtd on behalf of UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31364 PMCID: PMC6055869PMID: 29516507
