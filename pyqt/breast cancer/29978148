PC-PLC is an important biological target as it is knownto be upregulated in a variety of cancers, including triple negative breastcancer. Pyro-PtdEtn-QSY features a QSY21 quenching moiety instead of the BlackHole Quencher-3 (BHQ-3) used previously because the latter contains an azo bond, which could lead to biological instability.DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.8b00635 PMCID: PMC6026834PMID: 29978148
