However, the biological mechanisms underpinning these associations are stillunclear. We investigated for the first time whether and to what extent theassociation between enterolactone (ENL), the major lignan metabolite, andpostmenopausal breast cancer prognosis is mediated by inflammatory biomarkers.Circulating concentrations of ENL and inflammatory markers were measured in apopulation-based prospective cohort of 1,743 breast cancer patients recruitedbetween 2002 and 2005 and followed-up until 2009. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs were estimated using multivariable Cox regression. Mediation analysis wasperformed to estimate the percentage association between ENL (log2) and ACM,BCSM, and distant disease-free survival (DDFS), which is mediated by C-reactiveprotein (CRP) (log2), as the strongest potential mediator, and also interleukin(IL)-10. Median serum/plasma ENL and CRP concentrations for all patients,including 180 deceased patients, were 23.2 and 17.5 nmol/L, and 3.2 and 6.5 mg/l,respectively. ENL concentrations were significantly inversely associated withACM, BCSM and DDFS (per doubling of ENL concentrations: HRs 0.93 (0.87, 0.99),0.91 (0.84, 0.99), and 0.92 (0.87, 0.99)), after adjusting for prognostic factorsand BMI. Estimated 18%, 14% and 12% of the effects of ENL on ACM, BCSM and DDFS, respectively, were mediated through CRP. No mediational effect of IL-10 wasfound. We provide first evidence that the pro-inflammatory marker CRP maypartially mediate the association of ENL with postmenopausal breast cancersurvival, which supports hormone-independent mechanisms.
