The worldwide prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is approximately1â€‰billion. Vitamin D deficiency is a serious health problem with numerous health consequences; it is associated with diabetes, rheumatic arthritis, Parkinson,Alzheimer diseases, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and fractures in adults andcancers. Many reports showed an inverse association between serum vitamin Dconcentration and incidence of several cancers, including breast, colorectal,kidney, lung, and pancreatic. About 20 different cancers have incidence ratesinversely related to solar UV-B doses and serum vitamin D concentration.Considering the rising incidence of breast cancer and high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, this review aimed to reflect an association between serum vitamin Dconcentration and breast cancer risk, reveal the link between vitamin D receptor genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer risk, and review the relationship betweenvitamin D level, breast cancer risk, and prognostic factors such as tumor stage, grade, size, lymph node involvement, and hormone receptor status.DOI: 10.1177/1178223417749816 PMCID: PMC5802611PMID: 29434472
