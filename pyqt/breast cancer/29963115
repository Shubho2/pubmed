We hypothesized that ex vivoshear-wave elastography (SWE) would predict precisely the presence of metastasis in the excised lymph nodes.Methods: A total of 63 patients who underwent breast cancer surgery wereprospectively enrolled in this study from May 2014 to April 2015. The excisedaxillary lymph nodes were examined using ex vivo SWE. Metastatic status wasconfirmed based on the final histopathological diagnosis of the permanentsection. Lymph node characteristics and elasticity values measured by ex vivo SWEwere assessed for possible association with nodal metastasis.Results: A total of 274 lymph nodes, harvested from 63 patients, were examinedusing ex vivo SWE. The data obtained from 228 of these nodes from 55 patientswere included in the analysis. Results showed that 187 lymph nodes (82.0%) werenonmetastatic and 41 lymph nodes (18.0%) were metastatic. There was significantdifference between metastatic and nonmetastatic nodes with respect to the mean(45.4 kPa and 17.7 kPa, p<0.001) and maximum (55.3 kPa and 23.2 kPa, p<0.001)stiffness. The elasticity ratio was higher in the metastatic nodes (4.36 and1.57, p<0.001). Metastatic nodes were significantly larger than nonmetastaticnodes (mean size, 10.5 mm and 7.5 mm, p<0.001). The size of metastatic nodes and nodal stiffness were correlated (correlation coefficient of mean stiffness,r=0.553). The area under curve of mean stiffness, maximum stiffness, andelasticity ratio were 0.794, 0.802, and 0.831, respectively.Conclusion: Ex vivo SWE may be a feasible method to predict axillary lymph nodemetastasis intraoperatively in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.190 PMCID: PMC6015987PMID: 29963115
