In thisstudy, the phytochemical constituents (total phenolic, flavonoid and anthocyanin content) and individual phenolics and flavonoids of the extracts of sixteengenotypes of pigmented rice bran were evaluated using spectrophotometric andultra-high performance liquid chromatography method. Antioxidative properties of the free and bound fractions were evaluated using nitric oxide and1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assays. Extracts were evaluated forantiproliferative activity against breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 andMDA-MB-231) using the MTT assay.RESULTS: Signifficant diferences were observed in the concentrations ofphytochemicals and biological activities among different pigmented ricebrans. The highest phytochemical content was observed in black rice bran followedby red and brown rice bran. The concentration of free individual flavonoids andphenolic compounds were significantly higher than those of bound compounds exceptthose of ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid. Highest antioxidant activities wereobserved in black rice bran, followed by red and brown rice bran extracts.Extracts of black rice bran exhibited potent antiproliferative activity, withhalf maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 148.6 and 119.2 mg/mL againstMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively, compared to the activity of theextracts of red rice bran (175.0 and 151.0 mg/mL, respectively) and brown ricebran (382.3 and 346.1 mg/mL, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Black rice bran contains high levels of phytochemicals, and thus haspotent pharmaceutical activity. This highlights opportunities for researcher tobreed new genotypes of rice with higher nutritional values, which the foodindustry can use to develop new products that will compete in expandingfunctional food markets.DOI: 10.1186/s13065-018-0382-9 PMCID: PMC5816734PMID: 29455357
