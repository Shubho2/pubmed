[Epubahead of print]The role of sensing peptides in the cross-talk between microbiota and humancancer cells.Tornesello AL(1), Buonaguro L(1), Tornesello ML(1), Buonaguro FM(1).Author information: (1)Istituto Nazionale Tumori IRCCS "Fond G. Pascale" - Molecular Biology andViral Oncology Unit Napoli. Italy.The epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract is densely populated by complexmicrobial communities which exert both local and distant effects in the humanbody with relevant consequences on the metabolic status, immune system andoverall health. A dynamic equilibrium between the many bacterial species and the host intestinal epithelium is maintained through the release of a large number ofsmall molecules and peptides. The quorum sensing peptides are mainly secreted by Gram-positive bacteria and are able to "communicate" with human cells. Somesensing peptides have shown to promote angiogenesis, tumour cell invasion andmetastasis of colon cancer as well as of breast cancer cells. On the other hand, quorum sensing cyclo dipeptides produced by bacteria and fungi have shownsignificant antitumor activities. In this review we summarize the available data on the pro-tumour activities of quorum sensing peptides and the anti-cancerfunctions of cyclo dipeptides in the human malignancies.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1389557518666180713112119 PMID: 30003859
