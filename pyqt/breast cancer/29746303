In this review, we discuss the causes and underlying mechanisms ofacquired hypocholesterolaemia and its relevance to safety of therapeuticallyinduced decreased LDL cholesterol levels.RECENT FINDINGS: Hypocholesterolaemia is increasingly identified as cholesteroltesting becomes more widespread in the assessment of cardiovascular risk. Lowertherapeutic targets for LDL cholesterol are also being achieved more regularlywith the introduction of more intensive cholesterol-lowering regimens. Acquiredhypocholesterolaemia may be the presenting feature of treatable diseases.Understanding its mechanisms may also provide new treatment approaches forneoplastic disease, such as breast cancer, and infections, such as tuberculosis.SUMMARY: When hypocholesterolaemia is discovered, it is important to identify itscause. Further research into the pathogenesis of hypocholesterolaemia may providenew therapies for primary diseases underlying it.DOI: 10.1097/MOL.0000000000000526 PMID: 29746303
