One hundred eight breast lesions were divided into 4 subtypesaccording to the status of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, humanepidermal growth factor receptor type 2, and Ki67. Fisher discriminant analysiswas performed on the texture features that extracted from the enhancedhigh-resolution T1-weighted images and diffusion weighted images to establish theclassification model of molecular subtypes.RESULTS: The differentiation accuracies of Fisher discriminant analysis on theenhanced high-resolution T1-weighted images were 82.8% and 86.4% for 1.5T and3.0T imaging. Fisher discriminant analysis on diffusion weighted imaging texture features were achieved with a classification ability of 73.4% and 88.6%. Thecombined discriminant results for 2 kinds magnetic resonance images were 95.0%,97.7% in 1.5T and 3.0T imaging, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The fine results indicated a promising approach to predict themolecular subtypes of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1097/RCT.0000000000000738 PMID: 29659431  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
