However, literature on dietary fat and skin cancer has been limited.Methods: We examined the association between fatintake and risk of skin cancer including cutaneous malignant melanoma, squamouscell carcinoma (SCC), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) within two prospectivestudies: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-upStudy (HPFS). Dietary information on total, saturated, monounsaturated,polyunsaturated, omega-6, and omega-3 fat and cholesterol was repeatedly assessedgenerally every 4 years. Incident cases were identified by self-report. Diagnosison melanoma and SCC was confirmed by pathologic records.Results: A total of 794melanoma, 2,223 SCC, and 17,556 BCC in the NHS (1984-2012) and 736 melanoma,1,756 SCC, and 13,092 BCC in the HPFS (1986-2012) were documented. Higherpolyunsaturated fat intake was associated with risk of SCC [pooled HR for highestvs. lowest quintiles, 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-1.28;Ptrend=0.001] and BCC (pooled HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; Ptrend=0.01). Higheromega-6 fat intake was associated with risks of SCC, BCC, and melanoma. Omega-3fat intake was associated with risk of BCC, but not with SCC or melanoma. Noother fats were associated with melanoma risk. The associations were similar inwomen and men and by other skin cancer risk factors.Conclusions: Polyunsaturated fat intake was modestly associated with skin cancer risk.Impact: Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to identify relevant biologicalmechanisms.
