To enhance their tumor-targeting capability, thenanospheres were coated with PEGylated phospholipids and lactoferrin for passive and active targeting, respectively.RESULTS: The developed nanospheres demonstrated a small particle size andcontrolled drug release. In addition, the nanospheres revealed high serumstability, acceptable hemocompatibility, and good physical stability. Moreover, a5-fold scale-up of zein nanospheres could be enabled followed by spray-dryingusing 2.5% mannitol as a drying adjuvant. PEGylated and lactoferrin-targetednanospheres showed enhanced cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and 4T1 breast cancercells with higher selectivity to cancer cells rather than normal fibroblasts. Thein-vivo pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor efficacy confirmed the superiority ofzein nanospheres particularly after PEGylation compared to free drug(s). Theenhanced anti-cancer activity of nanocarriers was revealed as prolongedcirculation half-life, lower % change in tumor volume, reduced expression ofaromatase, Cyclin D1 and VEGF markers as well as amplified apoptosis andnecrosis.CONCLUSION: Overall, combined delivery of aromatase inhibitors and herbal drugsvia tumor-targeted zein nanospheres could serve as a promising strategy forbreast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1080/17425247.2018.1505858 PMID: 30067113
