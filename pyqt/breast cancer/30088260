Here, we aimed at assessing putative mechanisms associated with the ability of metformin to reduce the proliferationand migration of breast cancer cells.METHODS: A battery of in vitro assays including MTT, colony formation, NBT andscratch wound healing assays were performed to assess the viability,proliferation, anti-oxidative potential and migration of breast cancer-derivedMCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)assays along with fluorescence microscopy were used to assess apoptoticparameters. Quantification of SOD, Bcl-2, Bax, MMPs, miR-21 and miR-155expression was performed using qRT-PCR.RESULTS: We found that metformin inhibited the growth, proliferation andclonogenic potential of the breast cancer-derived cells tested. ROS levels werefound to be significantly reduced by metformin and, concomitantly, superoxidedismutase (SOD) isoforms were found to be upregulated. Mitochondrial dysfunction was observed in metformin treated cells, indicating apoptosis. In metastaticMDA-MB-231 cells, migration was found to be suppressed by metformin throughderegulation of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9. The oncogenicmicroRNAs miR-21 and miR-155 were found to be downregulated by metformin, whichmay be correlated with the suppression of cell proliferation and/or migration.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that metformin may play a pivotal role inmodulating the anti-oxidant system, including the SOD machinery, in breastcancer-derived cells. Our observations were validated by in silico analyses,indicating a close interaction between SOD and metformin. We also found thatmetformin may inhibit breast cancer-derived cell proliferation through apoptosis induction via the mitochondrial pathway. Finally, we found that metformin maymodulate the pro-apoptotic Bax, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, MMP-2, MMP-9, miR-21 andmiR-155 expression levels. These findings may be instrumental for the clinicalmanagement and/or (targeted) treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s13402-018-0398-0 PMID: 30088260
