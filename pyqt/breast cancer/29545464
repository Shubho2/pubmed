CD4 helper T cells are central to the development of coordinated immunity, and prior workshows their importance in protecting against relapse. Our previous identificationof degenerate HLA-class II epitopes from human FR led to the development of abroad coverage epitope pool potentially useful in augmenting antigen-specificimmune responses in most patients.Patients and Methods: We conducted a phase Iclinical trial testing safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine, enrollingpatients with ovarian cancer or breast cancer who completed conventionaltreatment and who showed no evidence of disease. Patients were initially treated with low-dose cyclophosphamide and then vaccinated 6 times, monthly. Immunity andsafety were examined during the vaccine period and up to 1 year later.Results:Vaccination was well tolerated in all patients. Vaccine elicited or augmentedimmunity in more than 90% of patients examined. Unlike recall immunity to tetanustoxoid (TT), FR T-cell responses developed slowly over the course of vaccination with a median time to maximal immunity in 5 months. Despite slow development ofimmunity, responsiveness appeared to persist for at least 12 months.Conclusions: The results demonstrate that it is safe to augment immunity to the FR tumorantigen, and the developed vaccine is testable for therapeutic activity in mostpatients whose tumors express FR, regardless of HLA genotype.
