Blood concentrations of the stress markers adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol,arginine-vasopressin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were measured. Pearson's correlation analysis and multilinear regression analysis were used to analyse thedata.RESULTS: At least mild depressive symptoms were noted in 50.5% of patients, while42.4% of patients exhibited at least mild anxiety symptoms. HAM-D score waspositively correlated with HAM-A (r=0.83, p<0.001) and BIS (r=0.29, p<0.001)scores and negatively correlated with RSES score (r=-0.41, p<0.001). HAM-A score was positively correlated with BIS score (r=0.32, p<0.001) and negativelycorrelated with RSES score (r=-0.27, p<0.001). There were no statisticallysignificant associations between stress markers and depression/anxiety.CONCLUSION: Patients with breast cancer frequently exhibit postoperativedepression and anxiety, which are related to low levels of self-esteem anddistorted body image.DOI: 10.30773/pi.2017.07.26 PMCID: PMC5900404PMID: 29475233
