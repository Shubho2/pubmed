Of therespondents, 16% reported that their decision was at least somewhat affected byanticipated costs. More patients opting for contralateral, prophylacticmastectomy had a "very large" anticipated financial burden than unilateralmastectomy patients (26% vs 9%, P = .037), but actual out-of-pocket costs andfinancial burden were similar between the two groups. Contralateral, prophylacticmastectomy patients, however, did not differ from unilateral mastectomy patients in their satisfaction with their decision nor quality of life, regardless ofout-of-pocket costs or financial burden (P > .05).CONCLUSION: Although contralateral, prophylactic mastectomy patients are morelikely to anticipate a "very large" financial burden compared with unilateralmastectomy patients, this does not seem to deter them from the contralateralprocedure.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
