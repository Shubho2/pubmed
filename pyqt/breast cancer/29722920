We measured IGF-I, IGF-II,pro-IGF-II, IGF bioactivity, IGFBP-2, -3, and pregnancy-associated plasma proteinA (PAPP-A), an IGFBP regulator, in baseline samples of 301 women with breastcancer treated on four protocols (Odense, Denmark: 1993-1998). We evaluatedperformance characteristics (expressed as area under the curve, AUC) using Coxregression models to derive hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals(CIs) for 10-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), andcompared those against the clinically used Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI). We measured the same biomarkers in 531 noncancer individuals to assessmultidimensional relationships (MDR), and evaluated additional prognostic models using survival artificial neural network (SANN) and survival support vectormachines (SSVM), as these enhance capture of MDRs. For RFS, increasingconcentrations of circulating IGFBP-2 and PAPP-A were independently prognostic[HRbiomarker doubling : 1.474 (95% CIs: 1.160, 1.875, P = 0.002) and 1.952 (95%CIs: 1.364, 2.792, P < 0.001), respectively]. The AUCRFS for NPI was 0.626 (Coxmodel), improving to 0.694 (P = 0.012) with the addition of IGFBP-2 plus PAPP-A. Derived AUCRFS using SANN and SSVM did not perform superiorly. Similar patternswere observed for OS. These findings illustrate an important principle inbiomarker qualification-measured circulating biomarkers may demonstrateindependent prognostication, but this does not necessarily translate intosubstantial improvement in clinical performance.© 2018 The Authors.
