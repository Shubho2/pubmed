United States.BACKGROUND: Search for new antiviral and anticancer agents are essential because of the emergence of drug resistance in recent years. In continuation of ourefforts in identifying the new small molecule antiviral and anticancer agents, weidentified chalcones as potent antiviral and anticancer agents.OBJECTIVE: With the aim of identifying the broad acting antiviral and anticancer agents, we discovered substituted aryl/heteroaryl derived thienyl chalcones asantiviral and anticancer agents.METHOD: A focused set of thienyl chalcone derivaties II-VI was screened forselected viruses Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Humancytomegalovirus (HCMV), Dengue virus 2 (DENV2), Influenza A (H1N1) virus, MERScoronavirus, Poliovirus 1 (PV 1), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Tacaribe virus (TCRV),Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) and Zika virus (ZIKV) using theNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)'s Division ofMicrobiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) antiviral screening program.Additionally, a cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has been screened for 60 humancancer cell lines using the Development Therapeutics Program (DTP) of NCI.RESULTS: All thienyl chalcone derivatives II-VI displayed moderate to excellentantiviral activity towards several viruses tested. Compounds V and VI were turnedout be active compounds towards human cytomegalovirus for both normal strain(AD169) as well as resistant isolate (GDGr K17). Particularly, cyano derivative Vshowed very high potency (EC50: <0.05 µM) towards AD169 strain of HCMV comparedto standard drug Ganciclovir (EC50: 0.12 µM). Additionally, it showed moderateactivity in the secondary assay (AD169; EC50: 2.30 µM). The cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV displayed high potency towards Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) andTacaribe virus (TCRV). The cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV is nearly 28 times more potent in our initial in vitro visual assay (EC50: 0.39 μg/ml) and nearly 17times more potent in neutral red assay (EC50: 0.71 μg/ml) compared to thestandard drug Ribavirin (EC50: 11 μg/ml; visual assay and EC50: 12 μg/ml; neutralred assay). It is nearly 12 times more potent in our initial in vitro visualassay (EC50: >1 μg/ml) and nearly 8 times more potent in neutral red assay (EC50:>1.3 μg/ml) compared to the standard drug Ribavirin (EC50: 12 μg/ml; visual assayand EC50: 9.9 μg/ml; neutral red assay) towards Tacaribe virus (TCRV).Additionally, cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has shown strong growthinhibitory activity towards three major cancer (colon, breast, and leukemia) celllines and moderate growth inhibition shown towards other cancer cell linesscreened.CONCLUSION: Compounds V and VI were demonstrated viral inhibition towards Humancytomegalovirus, whereas cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV towards Rift Valleyfever virus and Tacaribe virus. Additionally, cyclopropylquinoline derivative IV has displayed very good cytotoxicity against colon, breast and leukemia celllines in vitro.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1573406414666180524074648 PMID: 29792154
