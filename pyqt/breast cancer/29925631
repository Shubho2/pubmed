[Epub ahead of print]Volumetric mammographic density, age-related decline, and breast cancer riskfactors in a national breast cancer screening program.Hjerkind KV(1), Ellingjord-Dale M(2), Johansson ALV(3), Aase HS(4), Hoff SR(5),Hofvind S(6), Fagerheim S(7), Dos-Santos-Silva I(8), Ursin G(6).Author information: (1)Cancer Registry of Norway kirsti.vik.hjerkind@kreftregisteret.no.(2)Departement of research, Cancer Registry of Norway.(3)Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet.(4)Department of Radiology, Haukeland University Hospital.(5)Department of Radiology, Helse Møre og Romsdal HF.(6)Cancer Registry of Norway.(7)Department of Radiology, Stavanger University Hospital.(8)Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.BACKGROUND: Volumetric mammographic density (VMD) measures can be obtainedautomatically, but it is not clear how these relate to breast cancer riskfactors.METHODS: The cohort consisted of 46 428 women (aged 49-71 years) who participatedin BreastScreen Norway between 2007 and 2014 and had information on VMD andbreast cancer risk factors. We estimated means of percent and absolute VMDassociated with age, menopausal status, body mass index (BMI), and other factors.RESULTS: The associations between VMD and most breast cancer risk factors weremodest, although highly significant. BMI was positively associated with absolute VMD, while inversely associated with percent VMD. Percent VMD was inverselyassociated with a five-years older age at screening in premenopausal andpostmenopausal women (-0.18% versus -0.08% for percent VMD and -0.11 cm³ versus-0.03 cm³ for absolute VMD). This difference was largest among postmenopausalwomen with BMI&lt;25 kg/m² (p for interaction with percent VMD&lt;0.0001), never users of postmenopausal hormone therapy (p for interaction&lt;0.0001), andpremenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer (p for interactionwith absolute VMD=0.054).CONCLUSIONS: VMD is associated with several breast cancer risk factors, thestrongest being BMI, where the direction of the association differ for percentand absolute VMD. The inverse association with age appears modified by menopausalstatus and other breast cancer risk factors.IMPACT: Since VMD methods are becoming widely available in screening and clinicalsettings, the association between VMD measures and breast cancer risk factorsshould be investigated further in longitudinal studies.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0151 PMID: 29925631
