Highly metastatic celllines forming spontaneous metastasis following orthotopic implantation werepreviously developed and characterized regarding their biological andhistological characteristics. This study aimed to non-invasively andlongitudinally characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of metastasis formationand progression in the MDA-MB-231-derived triple negative LM2-4 and HER2+LM2-4H2N cell lines, using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), contrast enhancedcomputed tomography (CT), fluorescence imaging, and2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography([18F]FDG-PET).MATERIAL AND METHODS: LM2-4, LM2-4H2N, and MDA-MB-231 tumors were established in the right inguinal mammary fat pad (MFP) of female SCID mice and resected 14-16days later. Metastasis formation was monitored using BLI. Metabolic activity ofprimary and metastatic lesions in mice bearing LM2-4 or LM2-4H2N was assessed by [18F]FDG-PET. Metastatic burden at study endpoint was assessed by CT andfluorescence imaging following intravenous dual-modality liposome agentadministration.RESULTS: Comparable temporal metastasis patterns were observed using BLI for the highly metastatic cell lines LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N, while metastasis formed about 10days later for MDA-MB-231. 21 days post primary tumor resection, metastases were detected in 86% of LM2-4, 69% of LM2-4H2N, and 60% of MDA-MB-231 inoculated mice,predominantly in the axillary region, contralateral MFP, and liver/lung. LM2-4and LM2-4H2N tumors displayed high metabolism based on [18F]FDG-PET uptake. Lung metastases were detected as the [18F]FDG-PET uptake increased significantlybetween pre- and post-metastasis scan. Using a liposomal dual-modality agent, CT and fluorescence confirmed BLI detected lesions and identified additionalmetastatic nodules in the intraperitoneal cavity and lung.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of complementary anatomical and functional imagingtechniques can provide high sensitivity characterization of metastatic diseasespread, progression and overall disease burden. The described models and imaging toolset can be implemented as an effective means for quantitative treatmentresponse evaluation in metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196892 PMCID: PMC5933713PMID: 29723251  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
