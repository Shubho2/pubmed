During tumor progressionSNAIL1 has multiple effects in tumor cells that can impact metastasis. Aninflammatory tumor microenvironment also impacts metastasis and recently SNAIL1has been implicated as modulating the secretion of cytokines that can influencethe tumor immune infiltrate. Using a spontaneous genetic model of breast cancermetastasis and syngeneic orthotopic transplant experiments we show that theaction of SNAIL1 in primary breast tumor cells is required for breast tumorgrowth and metastasis. It does so, in part, by regulating production of GM-CSF,IL1α, IL-6, and TNFα by breast cancer cells. The SNAIL1-dependent tumor cellsecretome modulates the primary tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization.GM-CSF alone modulates TAM polarization and impacts breast cancer metastasis invivo. This study highlights another role for breast tumor SNAIL1 in cancerprogression to metastasis-modulation of the immune microenvironment of primarybreast tumors.DOI: 10.1038/s41389-018-0042-x PMCID: PMC5874242PMID: 29593211
