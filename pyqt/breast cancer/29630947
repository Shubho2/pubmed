In this study, two novel dihydrotriazine-chalconecompounds previously identified to exert anti-proliferative effects throughdual-targeting of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thioredoxin reductase(TrxR), were evaluated for their anti-invasive and anti-inflammatory abilities.At non-lethal concentrations, the compounds suppressed in vitro migration ofMDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells, which was correlated with a dose-dependentdownregulation of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced matrixmetalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression and secretion. At similar concentrations, these chalcone-based compounds suppressed expression of inflammatory mediatorsinducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inlipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells, aswell as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in LPS-stimulated human monocytesisolated from healthy donors. Mechanistically, inhibition of cancer cell invasionand inflammation by the compounds were mediated through suppression of thenuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, which corroborated with thereported mechanism of action of chalcones. Their abilities to target multiplebiological mediators relevant to multi-step carcinogenesis and with bioactivitiesstronger than those of the parent chalcone scaffold have warranteddihydrotriazine-chalcone compounds as promising candidates for use inpharmacological intervention of aggressive cancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
