Localimmuno-modulating treatments have been applied with promising results, but thelocal immune markers of Paget disease have not been studied.AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the local immune micro-environment of Pagetdisease.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four specimens from 41 patients, including caseswith multiple recurrences and underlying primary neoplasm, have been studied for their expression of CD3, PD-L1 and CTLA-4.RESULTS: Nineteen cases were mammary; 22 were extra-mammary and involved thevulva, the anus, the inguinal region and the lower extremity. PD-L1 was notexpressed by any neoplastic lesion or the associated lymphocytes. CTLA-4expression was found in nine cases. Higher stromal CD3 expression and moderatelevels of intra-epithelial CD3 expression were present in most cases. Biopsies,subsequent excision specimens and recurrences showed the same immunohistochemicalprofile of CD3 and PD-L1, although there were different levels of CTLA-4 in a fewcases. The underlying lesions in mammary Paget disease showed the sameimmunohistochemical profile as the intra-epithelial neoplastic cells. Theexpression of the markers did not correlate with age, sex, localization orrecurrence.CONCLUSION: Paget disease is characterized by an intense lymphocytic response,devoid of the immune-suppressive impact of the PD-L1 pathway, but with occasionalCTLA-4 expression.DOI: 10.1007/s00262-018-2189-x PMID: 29943071
