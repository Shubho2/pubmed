Apoptosis was detected by DAPI and annexin V/PI staining. DNA damage was assessed by cometassay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduction of mitochondrial membranepotential (MMP) were determined by flow cytometry. Cell migration was examined bywound healing assay. Protien expressions were determined by western blotting.RESULTS: Antiproliferative assay revealed that genistein reduced the cellviability of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose dependent manner with an IC50 of20 and 25 µM against Mia-PaCa2 and PANC-1 cancer cell lines respectively.However, its antiproliferative effects were less pronounced against non-cancerouspancreatic ductal epithelial cell line (H6C7) as evident from the IC50 of 120 µM.Genistein induced significant morphological changes in pancreatic cancer cellsand triggered cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. DAPI staining and flow cytometricanalysis revealed that genistein induced apoptosis in a dose dependent mannerthrough generation of substantial amounts of ROS and reduction of MMP. However,treatment of the pancreatic cancer with genistein and ascorbic acid couldabrogate the effects of genistein on cell viability. Protien expression analysis revealed that genistein upregulated cytosolic cytochrome c, Bax, cleavedCaspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 expressions with concomitant downregulation ofBcl-2 expression. Moreover, genistein inhibited the phosphorylation of signaltransducer and activator of transcription STAT3 proteins and downregulated theexpression of survivin, cyclin D1 and ALDH1A1 in Mia-PaCa2 cells in a dosedependent manner. Interestingly, genistein could inhibit the cell migrationpotential of the Mia-PaCa2 cells which was further associated with thedownregulation of metalloproteinases (MPP-2 and MPP-9).CONCLUSION: Taken together, we propose that genistein exerts anticancer activity in pancreatic cancer cells through induction of ROS mediated mitochondrialapoptosis, cell cycle arrest and regulation of STAT3 and may therefore provebeneficial in the management of pancreatic cancers cancer.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier GmbH.
