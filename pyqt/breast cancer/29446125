The dynamic-enhanced data are subtracted in k-spacefrom static mask data to increase sparsity for the local low-rank approach tomaximize temporal resolution. A T1 -weighted 3D radial trajectory (VIPR iterativedecomposition with echo asymmetry and least squares estimation [IDEAL]) wasmodified to meet the data acquisition requirements of the STELLR approach.Additionally, the unsubtracted enhanced data are reconstructed using compressedsensing and IDEAL to provide high-resolution fat/water separation. Thefeasibility of the approach and the dual reconstruction methodology isdemonstrated using a 16-channel breast coil and a 3T MR scanner in 6 patients.RESULTS: The STELLR temporal performance of subtracted data matched the expected temporal perfusion enhancement pattern in small and large vascular structures.Differential enhancement within heterogeneous lesions is demonstrated withcorroboration from a basic reconstruction using a strict 10-second temporalfootprint. Rapid acquisition, reliable fat suppression, and high spatiotemporalresolution are presented, despite significant data undersampling.CONCLUSION: The STELLR reconstruction approach of 3D radial sampling with masksubtraction provides a high-performance imaging technique for characterizingenhancing structures within the breast. It is capable of maintaining temporalfidelity, while visualizing breast lesions with high detail over a large FOV toinclude both breasts.Â© 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/mrm.27137 PMID: 29446125
