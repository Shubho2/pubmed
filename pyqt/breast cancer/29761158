Ruxolitinib is an orally bioavailable receptor tyrosine inhibitor targeting JAK1 and JAK2. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib inpatients with metastatic breast cancer. This was a non-randomized phase II study enrolling patients with refractory, metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Theprimary endpoint was objective response by RECIST 1.1. The study was designed to enroll patients whose archival tumor tissue was pSTAT3-positive (T-score >5) bycentral immunohistochemistry. pSTAT3 staining was available from 171 of 217consented patients and pSTAT3 T-score was positive in 67/171 (39.2%) tumors,suggesting that JAK-STAT activation is frequent. Twenty-three patients including one patient with inflammatory breast cancer were enrolled. Ruxolitinib waswell-tolerated with infrequent grade 3 or higher toxicities with fatigue as themost common toxicity. Among 21 patients who received at least one dose ofprotocol therapy, no objective responses were observed and the study was closedto further accrual. Pharmacodynamic analyses of baseline vs. cycle 2 biopsiessuggest on-target activity, including a significant decrease in the proportion ofpSTAT3+ cells in three patients with paired biopsies and downregulation ofJAK-STAT target genes and signatures via transcriptional analyses of 11 totalbaseline and four metastatic biopsies. Immuno-FISH analyses demonstrateintratumoral heterogeneity of pSTAT3 and JAK2 amplification. Ruxolitinib, as asingle agent, did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint in this refractorypatient population despite evidence of on-target activity.DOI: 10.1038/s41523-018-0060-z PMCID: PMC5935675PMID: 29761158
