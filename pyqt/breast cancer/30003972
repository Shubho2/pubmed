Electronic address: weihe@cpu.edu.cn.Treatment of metastatic cancer continues to be a huge challenge worldwide.Notably, drug nanocrystals (Ns) in nanosuspensions clearly belong to a type ofnanoparticle. Therefore, a question arose as to whether these drug particles can also be applied as carriers for drug delivery. Here, we design a novel paclitaxel(PTX) nanocrystal stabilized with complexes of matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-sensitive β-casein/marimastat (MATT) for co-delivering MATT and PTX andcombined therapy of metastatic breast cancer. The prepared Ns (200 nm) with adrug-loading of >50% were potent in treatment of metastatic cancer, whichmarkedly inhibited MMP expression and activity and greatly blocked the lungmetastasis and angiogenesis. In conclusion, employing protein-drug complexes asstabilizers, Ns with dual payloads are developed and are a promising strategy forco-delivery. Furthermore, the developed Ns can target the tumor microenvironment and cancer cells and, as a result, enable efficient treatment for breastmetastatic cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
