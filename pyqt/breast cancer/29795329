Doxorubicin- and simvastatin-inducedcytotoxicity has been associated with the modulation of Ca2+ signaling, but theunderlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we identify how Ca2+signaling regulates the breast tumor cell response to doxorubicin andsimvastatin. These two drugs inhibit cell survival while increasing apoptosis in two human breast cancer cell lines and five primary breast tumor specimensthrough the modulation of Ca2+ signaling. Signal transduction and functionalstudies revealed that both simvastatin and doxorubicin trigger persistentcytosolic Ca2+ release, thereby stimulating the proapoptotic BIM pathway andmitochondrial Ca2+ overload, which are responsible for metabolic dysfunction and apoptosis induction. Simvastatin and doxorubicin suppress the prosurvival ERK1/2 pathway in a Ca2+-independent and Ca2+-dependent manner, respectively. Inaddition, reduction of the Ca2+ signal by chelation or pharmacological inhibitionsignificantly prevents drug-mediated anticancer signaling. Unexpectedly, ascratch-wound assay indicated that these two drugs induce rapid cell migration,while inhibiting cell invasion and colony formation in a Ca2+-dependent manner.Further, the in vivo data for MDA-MB-231 xenografts demonstrate that uponchelation of Ca2+, the ability of both drugs to reduce the tumor burden wassignificantly reduced via caspase-3 deactivation. Our results establish acalcium-based mechanism as crucial for executing the cell death process triggeredby simvastatin and doxorubicin, and suggest that combining simvastatin withdoxorubicin may be an effective regimen for the treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0329-6 PMID: 29795329
