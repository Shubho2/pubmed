It has been established that NCT in LABC may effectively induceapoptosis. The study objective was to assess the role of a proapoptotic secondmitochondria-derived activator of apoptosis (SMAC) in LABC. The study groupcomprised 56 patients with advanced non-metastatic breast cancer (stage IIB -nodepositive and III), who received NCT followed by surgery and adjuvant treatment.Expression of SMAC protein was analysed using the immunohistochemistry technique in core biopsies sampled from the patients' breasts before NCT and in surgicalspecimens collected after completion of NCT. Expression of SMAC was significantlyhigher in the breast cancer specimens after NCT (p < 0.01). High expression ofSMAC in the core biopsy before NCT correlated with a pathological completeremission (pCR, p < 0.01). The patients with a high expression of SMAC in thesurgical specimens after NCT had longer DFS. Our study proves a potential role ofSMAC expression in LABC as a novel favourable prognostic factor in LABC for pCRand disease-free survival (DFS).DOI: 10.5114/pjp.2018.75334 PMID: 29895124  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
