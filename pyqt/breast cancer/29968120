Anticipated structures of all titled compounds were in agreement with spectraland analytical (C, H and N) analyses. The compounds were screened for in vitroantibacterial activity against both G+ and G- bacterial strains andantiproliferative activity against K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), MCF-7(breast cancer), MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), COLO 205 (colorectaladenocarcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) cell lines. Further, potentantibacterial compounds were subjected to molecular docking studies in order togain insight into their plausible binding modes and mechanism of action againstMurB. The modeling results were in agreement with the experimental data.DOI: 10.1007/s11030-018-9845-0 PMID: 29968120
