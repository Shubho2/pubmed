This cross-sectional study sought to quantifythe OOPEs experienced by rural cancer patients in Western Australia (WA), anddetermine factors that contributed to higher OOPE.METHODS: Four hundred people diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal or prostate cancer who resided in selected rural regions of WA were recruited through the WA Cancer Registry and contacted at least 3 months after diagnosis to report themedical OOPE (such as surgery or chemotherapy, supportive care, medication andtests) and non-medical OOPE (such as travel costs, new clothing and utilities)they had experienced as a result of accessing and receiving treatment.Bootstrapped t tests identified demographic, financial and treatment-relatedfactors to include in multivariate analysis, performed using log-linkedgeneralised linear models with gamma distribution.RESULTS: After a median 21 weeks post-diagnosis, participants experienced anaverage OOPE of AU$2179 (bootstrapped 95% confidence interval $1873-$2518), and45 (11%) spent more than 10% of their household income on these expenses.Participants likely to experience higher total OOPE were younger than 65 years(p = 0.008), resided outside the South West region (p = 0.007) and had privatehealth insurance (PHI) (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Rural WA cancer patients experience significant OOPE following theirdiagnosis. The impact these expenses have on patient wellbeing and theirtreatment decisions need to be further explored.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4205-2 PMID: 29704109
