Thecohort was treated by 2 field radiotherapy (2FRT; breast and chest wall, N = 75),3 field radiotherapy (3FRT; + supraclavicular lymphatic region, N = 8), or with4 field radiotherapy (4FRT; + parasternal lymphatic region, N = 17). Ninety-onepatients received various systemic treatments prior to irradiation. Following an initial screening visit post-RT, two additional visits after 12 and 25 weeks wereconducted including radiographic examination. In addition, general anamnesis and the co-medication were recorded. The endpoint was reached as soon as apneumonitis was developed or at maximum of six months post-treatment.RESULTS: A pneumonitis incidence of 13% was determined. Of 91 patients with priorsystemic therapy, 11 patients developed pneumonitis. Smoking history and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) appeared to be positive predictors, whereas past pneumonia clearly promoted pneumonitis. Further pneumonitis-promotingpredictors are represented by the applied field extensions (2 field radiotherapy [2FRT] < 3 field radiotherapy [3FRT] < 4 field radiotherapy [4FRT]) and the type of combined initial systemic therapies. As a consequence, all of the threepatients in the study cohort treated with 4FRT and initial chemotherapy combined with anti-hormone and antibody protocols developed pneumonitis. A combination of the hormone antagonists tamoxifen and goserelin might enhance the risk forpneumonitis. Remarkably, none of the 11 patients co-medicated with statinssuffered from pneumonitis.CONCLUSIONS: The rapidly increasing use of novel systemic therapy schedulescombined with radiotherapy (RT) needs more prospective studies with largercohorts. Our results indicate that contribution to pneumonitis occurrence ofvarious (neo)adjuvant therapy approaches followed by RT is of minor relevance,whereas mean total lung doses of >10 Gy escalate the risk of lung tissuecomplications. The validity of potential inhibitors of therapy-inducedpneumonitis as observed for statin co-medication should further be investigatedin future trials.DOI: 10.1007/s00066-017-1257-z PMCID: PMC5960004PMID: 29450591
