Materialsand Methods: Twenty-two female patients were recruited either with suspectedbreast cancer on screening mammography (n = 16) or underwent breast cancerradical mastectomy (n = 6). All the 22 patients underwent PET/CT at 30-45 minafter intravenous injection of 68Ga-BBN-RGD. Eleven out of 22 patients alsoaccepted 68Ga-BBN PET/CT within 2 weeks for comparison. A final diagnosis wasmade based on the histopathologic examination of surgical excision or biopsy.Results: Both the primary cancer and metastases showed positive 68Ga-BBN-RGDaccumulation. The T/B ratios of 68Ga-BBN-RGD accumulation were 2.10 to 9.44 inprimary cancer and 1.10 to 3.71 in axillary lymph node metastasis, 3.80 to 10.7in distant lymph nodes, 2.70 to 5.35 in lung metastasis and 3.17 to 22.8 in bone metastasis, respectively. For primary lesions, the SUVmax from 68Ga-BBN-RGD PETin ER positive group was higher than that in ER negative group (P < 0.01). Forboth primary and metastatic lesions, SUVmean quantified from 68Ga-BBN-RGD PETcorrelated well with both GRPR expression and integrin αvβ3 expression.Conclusion: This study demonstrated significant uptake of a new type of dualintegrin αvβ3 and GRPR targeting radiotracer in both the primary lesion and themetastases of breast cancer. 68Ga-BBN-RGD PET/CT may be of great value indiscerning both primary breast cancers, axillary lymph node metastasis anddistant metastases.DOI: 10.7150/thno.22601 PMCID: PMC5817114PMID: 29464003
