Sublinesestablished from stroma-treated FR-cells (C-FR cells) and D-cells (C-D cells)show permanently high expression of integrin β1 as well as Bcl-3 and P-STAT3(C-FR) or IGF1R (C-D). Yet, cells fail to withstand fulvestrant better and do notmigrate or grow faster than control cells. Instead, C-D cells rely on stromalfactors to perform as well as control cells. In addition, C-FR cells adapted tointegrin β1 for growth in 3D cultures. These data suggest that long-term exposureto stromal factors leads to addiction rather than better performance in cellular activities. We also found that morphologically distinct breast cancer cell linesubpopulations share key responses to stromal factors suggesting thatintratumoral heterogeneity may play a minor role in the interaction betweenbreast cancer and stromal cells.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25183 PMCID: PMC5955132PMID: 29774124
