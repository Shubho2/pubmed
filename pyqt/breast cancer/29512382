We utilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as supportingmatrix to immobilize polycytosine DNA sequence (dC20) for electrochemical currentgeneration and anti-HER2 antibodies. In the presence of target HER2, a sandwichedimmunocomplex forms between a peptide specific to HER2 immobilized on the goldelectrode and the anti-HER2 antibodies on the AuNPs. The HER2 captured by thesensor is detected because of the reaction of the dC20 phosphate backbone withmolybdate, forming redox molybdophosphate precipitate that generates anelectrochemical current on the surface of the electrode. The assay is sensitive: the calculated limit of detection of HER2 was as low as 0.5 pg/mL and thedetection was linear to HER2 from 1 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL. The sensor's specificity ishigh, and there is no cross reactivity with several potential interferents, such as human IgG, human IgA, p53, carcinoembryonic antigen, and protein kinase. Thesensor's performance with HER2 in clinical serum samples is similar to theperformance of commercial ELISA assays. The configuration of polycytosine DNA as electrochemical current generating label and anti-HER2 antibodies on AuNPs isversatile and can be reconfigured to detect low levels of different analytes, or made more sensitive by amplifying the DNA to produce more phosphate to react withNa2MoO4.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00023 PMID: 29512382
