Electronic address:bperez@isciii.es.Night shift work can affect hormonal balance, and so might be a risk factor forgynaecological malignancies. This report presents a systematic review on theassociation between this occupational exposure and the incidence ofgynaecological cancers other than breast cancer. We searched for originalarticles addressing this issue in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science, and used the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Index to evaluate the methodological quality ofthose reports selected for review. Globally, we found only six articles, whichprovided the results of just six research studies: four examined ovarian cancer, two endometrial tumours and two cervical cancer. Our results show that thismatter has received scant attention from the research community, and that thelittle evidence available does not show any clear relationship between nightshift work and ovarian, endometrial or cervical cancer. More prospective rigorousstudies are needed to evaluate these associations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.maturitas.2018.01.008 PMID: 29563031
