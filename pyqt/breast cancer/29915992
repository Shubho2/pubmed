This paper proposes a new and simple system for microcalcification detection to assist in early breast cancer detection. This work uses the two most recognized public mammogramdatabases, MIAS and DDSM. We are introducing a MC detection method based on (1)Beucher gradient for detection of regions of interest (ROIs), (2) an annulusmodel for extraction of few and effective features from candidates to MCs, and(3) one classification stage with two different classifiers, k Nearest Neighbor(KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). For dense mammograms in the MIASdatabase, the performance metrics achieved are sensitivity of 0.9835, false alarmrate of 0.0083, accuracy of 0.9835, and area under the ROC curve of 0.9980 with aKNN classifier. The proposed MC detection method, based on a KNN classifier,achieves, a sensitivity, false positive rate, accuracy and area under the ROCcurve of 0.9813, 0.0224, 0.9795 and 0.9974 for the MIAS database; and 0.9035,0.0439, 0.9298 and 0.9759 for the DDSM database. By slightly reducing the truepositive rate the method achieves three instances with false positive rate of 0: 2 on fatty mammograms with KNN and SVM, and one on dense with SVM. The proposedmethod gives better results than those from state of the art literature, when themammograms are classified in fatty, fatty-glandular, and dense.DOI: 10.1007/s10916-018-0989-3 PMID: 29915992
