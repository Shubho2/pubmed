In this data note, we provide RNA sequencing data from murine MECs and ESCs, MECs treated with steroid hormone alone and in combination with PRL.This data could help in understanding temporal dynamics of mRNA transcriptionthat impact the process of lactogenesis associated with mammary glanddevelopment. Further integration of these data sets with existing datasets ofcells derived from various stages of mammary gland development and differenttypes of breast tumors, should pave the way for effective prognosis and todevelop therapies for breast cancer.DATA DESCRIPTION: We have generated RNA-sequencing data representing steady-statelevels of mRNAs from murine ESCs, normal MECs (N), MECs primed (P) withhydrocortisone (HC) alone and in combination with PRL hormone by using Illuminasequencing platform. We have generated ~ 58 million reads for ESCs with anaverage length of ~ 100 nt and an average 115 million good quality mapped readswith an average length of ~ 150 nt for different stages of MECs differentiation.DOI: 10.1186/s13104-018-3351-4 PMCID: PMC5896049PMID: 29642945
