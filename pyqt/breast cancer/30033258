During the process of nanoparticles(NPs) preparation, we found good inter-structure consistency of polymer was theprecondition for forming into stable NPs, and those with micro-phase separationstructure were prepared of NPs within limits. Hemolytic test and CCK-8 assayresults demonstrated the biotoxicity of both NPs and whose leaching liquor wasfar below related toxicity standards. Two kinds of cell, human breast cancer cellline (MCF-7) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (EC), showed differentmanners in test of NPs size-cell proliferation relationship, respectively.Monitored by a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and a gel permeationchromatography (GPC), the degradation behavior of NPs in aqueous solutionindicated amide bond break more difficultly than ester bond, and FA classicproton peak disappeared in the third week, meanwhile lactic acid (LA) unit numberbecame 25% of the initial. Finally the NPs was completely degraded in the eighth week. In the whole process, NPs underwent a change from compact to loose state.We hope these results will benefit to improve design of drug delivery system innanomedicine, which could offer the selection rule for amphiphilic polymer NPs onmaterial and size.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
