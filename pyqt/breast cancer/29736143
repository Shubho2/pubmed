We hypothesized that insurance status would significantly impact outcomes inprimary breast sarcoma (PBS) due to the additional challenges of diagnosing andcoordinating specialized care for a rare cancer. Using the National CancerDatabase, we identified adult females diagnosed with PBS between 2004 and 2013.The influence of insurance status on overall survival (OS) was evaluated usingthe Kaplan-Meier estimator with log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazardmodels. Among a cohort of 607 patients, 67 (11.0%) had Medicaid, 217 (35.7%) had Medicare, and 323 (53.2%) had private insurance. Compared to privately insuredpatients, Medicaid patients were more likely to present with larger tumors andhave their first surgical procedure further after diagnosis. Treatment wassimilar between patients with comparable disease stage. In multivariate analysis,Medicaid (hazard ratio (HR), 2.47; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.62-3.77; p <0.001) and Medicare (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.10-2.57; p=0.017) were independentlyassociated with worse OS. Medicaid insurance coverage negatively impactedsurvival compared to private insurance more in breast sarcoma than in breastcarcinoma (interaction p < 0.001). In conclusion, patients with Medicaidinsurance present with later stage disease and have worse overall survival thanprivately insured patients with PBS. Worse outcomes for Medicaid patients areexacerbated in this rare cancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/4626174 PMCID: PMC5875066PMID: 29736143
