The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of FN and the ANC profile inpatients undergoing chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim primary prophylaxis.Methods: Patients receiving 6 cycles of adjuvant docetaxel, doxorubicin, andcyclophosphamide (TAC) chemotherapy were included in this study. Pegfilgrastimwas administered with analgesics 24 hours after treatment. Laboratory tests were performed on day 0 (before chemotherapy) and ANC was measured daily starting day 5 until it were restored to 1,000/mm3. Bone pain was checked via the numeralrating scale (NRS).Results: A total of 61 patients and 366 cycles were evaluated. Mean age was 49.2 Â± 7.1 years. FN was seen in 5 patients (16.4%) and 12 cycles (3.3%) withpegfilgrastim. Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia was seen in 91.5% of cycles with FN.The ANC nadir was most commonly seen at day 7 and the mean ANC nadir depth was265.7/m3. Age was negatively correlated with nadir depth (r = -0.137, P = 0.009).Severe pain higher than NRS 7 occurred in less than 20% of patients after theadministration of pegfilgrastim.Conclusion: Incidence of FN was low during the chemotherapy by primaryprophylaxis with pegfilgrastim. The ANC nadir was seen on day 7 afterchemotherapy. Bone pain with pegfilgrastim was well tolerated during TACchemotherapy.DOI: 10.4174/astr.2018.94.5.223 PMCID: PMC5931931PMID: 29732352
