However, the incidence of multiple primary malignancies is increasingdue to the improved survival of cancer patients, the prolonged lifespan of thegeneral population, and better diagnostic techniques. This report describes a73-year-old woman with primary breast, rectal squamous cell, and renal cellcarcinomas. This case is unique because, in addition to having three primarymalignancies, this patient had rectal squamous cell carcinoma-one of the raresttypes of rectal cancer. We discuss screening and prevention of multiplemalignancies and rectal squamous cell carcinoma, as well as methods for managing these patients.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2384 PMCID: PMC5973498PMID: 29850379
