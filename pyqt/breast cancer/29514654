However, there is little known about conversion frequency ofestrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) status for hormonereceptor positive-breast cancer patients after NAC and their correlation withprognosis.METHODS: In this study, 231 breast cancer patients with residual disease afterNAC were enrolled and divided into receptor stable group (having no conversion inboth ER and PR status pre- and post-NAC) and any receptor conversion group(having any conversion in either ER or PR status). Univariate and multivariatesurvival analyses were used to compare survival differences between the twogroups.RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (23.8%) had ER and/or PR conversion after NAC.Younger patients (≤ 50 years) were more likely to have receptor conversion(P = 0.014). For 213 patients (92.2%) who received adjuvant endocrinotherapyafter surgery, the 5-year disease free survival (DFS) estimates for patients inthe any receptor conversion group (55.2%) was worse than patients in the receptorstable group (73.7%, Log-rank test, P = 0.015). While the 5-year overall survivalestimates for patients with or without receptor conversion were not statisticallydifferent (86.0 vs. 82.4%, Log-rank test, P = 0.587). In multivariate Coxproportional hazard analyses, patients with any receptor conversion had worse DFS(hazard ratio, 1.995; 95% confidence interval, 1.130-3.521, P = 0.031).CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to recommend patients to test biomarkers in residualdisease and pay more attention to patients who have any receptor conversion.These patients may need more individual therapy after surgery.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1332-7 PMCID: PMC5842586PMID: 29514654
