The decline in menarcheal ageover the past century may be partially attributable to increased exposure toendocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs).METHODS: We assessed the influence of 26 phenol and phthalate biomarkers on thetiming of menarche in a longitudinal cohort of Chilean girls. These EDCs werequantified in urine collected prior to the onset of breast development (Tanner 1;B1), and during adolescence (Tanner 4; B4). Multivariable accelerated failuretime (AFT) models were used to analyze associations between biomarkerconcentrations and the age of menarche adjusting for body mass index (BMI)Z-score and maternal education, accounting for within-subject correlation.RESULTS: Several biomarkers were significantly associated with the age atmenarche; however, these associations were dependent on the timing of biomarkerassessment. A log(ng/ml) increase in B1 concentrations of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate biomarkers was associated with later menarche (hazard ratio (HR): 0.77;95% CI: 0.60, 0.98), whereas higher B1 concentrations of 2,5-dichlorophenol andbenzophenone-3 were associated with earlier menarche (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01,1.27; HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.29, respectively). Elevated B4 concentrations of monomethyl phthalate were similarly associated with earlier menarche (HR: 1.30;95% CI: 1.10, 1.53). The impact of monoethyl phthalate and triclosanconcentrations on pubertal timing were significantly modified by BMI Z-score.Higher monoethyl phthalate and triclosan concentrations were associated withearlier menarche among overweight or obese girls, but not among those that werenormal weight.CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies modulation of sexual maturation by specificEDC biomarkers in Latina girls.DOI: 10.1186/s12940-018-0376-z PMCID: PMC5883544PMID: 29615064
