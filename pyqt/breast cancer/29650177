Comfort is a crucial component ofnursing in palliative care, especially in breast cancer patients. However, thiscondition is difficult to assess and therefore assign as a diagnosis. Somecomfort assessment tools have been developed in other countries are found notappropriate for an Indonesian context. This study is a sequence of priorqualitative research regarding a comfort assessment tool to be developed inIndonesia. This study piloted the comfort assessment tool in 55 patients withbreast cancer to test if it is valid, reliable, and easy to use.

The face validity test yieldedcoefficient a of 0.299-0.691, while the reliability test produced a reasonablygood result as well (a = 0.912). Therefore this measure should be furtherassessed by an expert panel and including construct validity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier España, S.L.U.
