Electronic address: zhoulongxinghua@qq.com.Cumulative evidence has associated microRNA (miRNA) with cancer development, and among those miRNAs, miR-145 has been identified as an anti-oncomiRNA. However,the comprehensive mechanisms of action of miR-145 in breast cancer developmenthave not yet been fully elucidated. Herein, we performed next-generationsequencing to detect the expression profiles of the transcriptome and conductedcellular function experiments after miR-145 overexpression. The results verified the inhibitory effects of miR-145 on breast cancer cell proliferation, colonyformation, migration and invasion. Sequencing data revealed that miR-145triggered the alteration of the whole transcriptome and further led to regulationof the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. Our study also identified a listof 49 target mRNAs of miR-145 and specific non-coding RNAs, which could beutilized as potential breast cancer biomarkers. This study might serve as asignificant platform for further research on miR-145 along with the ceRNA networkin breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
