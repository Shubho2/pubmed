Electronic address:scorr@bcm.edu.Noninvasive radiofrequency-induced (RF) hyperthermia has been shown to increasethe perfusion of chemotherapeutics and nanomaterials through cancer tissue inectopic and orthotopic murine tumor models. Additionally, mild hyperthermia(37°C-45°C) has previously shown a synergistic anticancer effect when used withstandard-of-care chemotherapeutics such as gemcitabine and Abraxane. However, RF hyperthermia treatment schedules remain unoptimized, and the mechanisms of actionof hyperthermia and how they change when treating various tumor phenotypes arepoorly understood. Therefore, pretreatment screening of tumor phenotypes toidentify key tumors that are predicted to respond more favorably to hyperthermia will provide useful mechanistic data and may improve therapeutic outcomes.Herein, we identify key biophysical tumor characteristics in order to predict theoutcome of combinational RF and chemotherapy treatment. We demonstrate thatultrasound imaging using Doppler mode can be utilized to predict the response of combinational RF and chemotherapeutic therapy in a murine 4T1 breast cancermodel.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
