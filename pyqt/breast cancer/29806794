Epub2018 May 28.The history of natural progesterone, the never-ending story.Piette P(1).Author information: (1)a Consultant at Besins Healthcare Global , Department of R & D, Scientific &Medical Affairs , Brussels , Belgium.The term progesterone should only be used for the natural hormone produced by theovaries or included in a registered drug. The modern history of progesteronebegins with the first book-length description of the female reproductive systemincluding the corpus luteum and later with the Nobel Prize winner, AdolfButenandt who took a crucial step when he succeeded in converting pregnanediolinto a chemically pure form of progesterone, the corpus luteum hormone. Thedeficient production of progesterone was shown first to be the cause of theluteal-phase deficiency responsible for infertility and early pregnancy loss due to inadequate secretory transformation of the endometrium. Later, progesteronewas confirmed to be the best and safest method of providing luteal-phase support in assisted reproductive technology. Progesterone provides adequate endometrialprotection and is suggested to be the optimal progestagen in menopausal hormonetherapy in terms of cardiovascular effects, venous thromboembolism, probablystroke and even breast cancer risk. Neuroprotective effects of progesterone have also been demonstrated in several of experimental models including cerebralischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Vaginal progesterone was shown todecrease the risk of preterm birth in women with a mid-trimester sonographicshort cervix and to improve perinatal outcomes in singleton and twin gestations.DOI: 10.1080/13697137.2018.1462792 PMID: 29806794
