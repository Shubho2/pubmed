Analysis ofbreast cancer genomic DNA indicates frequent loss-of-function mutations incomponents of the cJUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Since JNKsignaling can promote cell proliferation by activating the AP1 transcriptionfactor, this apparent association of reduced JNK signaling with tumor developmentwas unexpected. We examined the effect of JNK deficiency in the murine breastepithelium. Loss of JNK signaling caused genomic instability and the development of breast cancer. Moreover, JNK deficiency caused widespread early neoplasia and rapid tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer. This tumor suppressive function was not mediated by a role of JNK in the growth of established tumors,but by a requirement of JNK to prevent tumor initiation. Together, these dataidentify JNK pathway defects as 'driver' mutations that promote genomeinstability and tumor initiation.Â© 2018, Girnius et al.DOI: 10.7554/eLife.36389 PMCID: PMC5984035PMID: 29856313
