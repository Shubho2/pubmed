Sonja.Stadler@medizin.uni-leipzig.de.Obesity is a known risk factor for breast cancer. Since obesity rates areconstantly rising worldwide, understanding the molecular details of theinteraction between adipose tissue and breast tumors becomes an urgent task. Toinvestigate potential molecular changes in breast cancer cells induced byco-existing adipocytes, we used a co-culture system of different breast cancercell lines (MCF-7 and T47D: ER+/PR+/HER2- and MDA-MB-231: ER-/PR-/HER2-) andmurine 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Here, we report that co-culture with adipocytesrevealed distinct changes in global gene expression pattern in the differentbreast cancer cell lines. Our microarray data revealed that in both ER+ celllines, top upregulated genes showed significant enrichment for hormone receptortarget genes. In triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, co-culture with adipocytes ledto the induction of pro-inflammatory genes, mainly involving genes of the Nf-κBsignaling pathway. Moreover, co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells showed increasedsecretion of the pro-inflammatory interleukins IL-6 and IL-8. Using a specificNF-κB inhibitor, these effects were significantly decreased. Finally, migratorycapacities were significantly increased in triple-negative breast cancer cellsupon co-culture with adipocytes, indicating an enhanced aggressive cellphenotype. Together, our studies illustrate that factors secreted by adipocyteshave a significant impact on the molecular biology of breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27210-w PMCID: PMC6013441PMID: 29930291
