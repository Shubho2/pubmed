Thetransforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway plays critical roles during breastcancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. SMAD2, a positive regulator of TGF-β signaling, promotes breast cancer metastasis through inductionof EMT.METHODS: The expression of miR-190 and SMAD2 in breast cancer tissues, adjacentnormal breast tissues and cell lines were determined by RT-qPCR. The proteinexpression levels and localization were analyzed by western blotting andimmunofluorescence. ChIP and dual-luciferase report assays were used to validate the regulation of ZEB1-miR-190-SMAD2 axis. The effect of miR-190 on breast cancerprogression was investigated both in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: miR-190 down-regulation is required for TGF-β-induced EMT. miR-190suppresses breast cancer metastasis both in vitro and in vivo by targeting SMAD2.miR-190 expression is down-regulated and inversely correlates with SMAD2 inbreast cancer samples, and its expression level was associated with outcome inpatients with breast cancer. Furthermore, miR-190 is transcriptionally regulated by ZEB1.CONCLUSIONS: Our data uncover the ZEB1-miR-190-SMAD2 axis and provide a mechanismto explain the TGF-β network in breast cancer metastasis.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0818-9 PMCID: PMC5838994PMID: 29510731
