Clinicians are concerned that AUS may lead to unnecessary ALND.The authors developed an algorithm (Algorithm 1) in which the number ofAUS-suspicious nodes and tumor biology direct management. For estrogenreceptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-)breast cancer with a single AUS-suspicious node and a positive lymph node needle biopsy (LNNB), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is performed with a specimenX-ray documenting retrieval of the clipped node. Other patients with positiveLNNB receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The authors hypothesized that routine AUS and this algorithm could decrease ALND compared with a strategy of nopreoperative AUS.METHODS: Decision-tree analysis and Monte Carlo simulation were used to assessthe expected number of ALNDs under two strategies (routine AUS vs no AUS).Probabilities were drawn from a literature review and an institutional database. The authors assumed nodal pathologic complete response rates as reported in theliterature. Four additional algorithms were created to assess whether any othertreatment model could decrease the rate of ALND.RESULTS: Using the routine AUS and the authors' algorithm, the predicted ALNDrate was 9%, versus 10% for a strategy of no AUS, with overlapping uncertaintyintervals. The remaining treatment algorithms showed similar results.DISCUSSION: Use of AUS may help to tailor patient care without leading tooverutilization of ALND, as long as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered whenappropriate.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6545-z PMID: 29868976
