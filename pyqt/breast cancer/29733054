The acquiredvolumetric imaging data were used for calculation, mapping and analysis by using a body tumor perfusion protocol in the CT perfusion software to measure 4parameters: blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), and the permeability surface (PS) area product. Statistical data analysis was thenperformed to distinguish the difference of the 4 parameter values among normalcontrol, breast cancer and breast fibroadenoma cases.RESULTS: The mean perfusion values of 15 normal controls were as follows: BF,20.03±4.08 mL/100 g/min; BV, 4.53±0.95 mL/100 g; MTT, 5.90±0.82 s; and PS,9.25±1.18 mL/100 g/min. The mean perfusion values of 30 cancer patients were asfollows: BF, 56.67±6.59 mL/100 g/min; BV, 5.82±0.68 mL/100 g; MTT, 6.01±0.82 s;and PS, 24.95±5.05 mL/100 g/min. The mean perfusion values of 20 patients withbreast fibroadenoma were as follows: BF, 46.24±6.65 mL/100 g/min; BV,5.07±0.73 mL/100 g; MTT, 7.51±0.62 s; and PS, 16.73±6.48 mL/100 g/min. Comparing the 3 groups, differences were all statistically significant for BF, BV, MTT and PS values (p < 0.05, respectively); The BF, BV, PS values were highest in groupof cancer patients, while the MTT value was highest in group of patientsdiagnosed with breast fibroadenoma.CONCLUSION: Breast CT perfusion imaging is a promising functional imagingtechnology in breast cancer diagnosis, which can provide valuable quantitativeimaging markers to assist evaluation of breast tumors.DOI: 10.3233/XST-18377 PMID: 29733054
