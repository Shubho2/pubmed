Literature searches of MEDLINE and SCOPUS were performed through September 2017to identify real-world studies of ≥ 20 patients evaluating the incidence ofrecurrent VTE, major bleeding, or all-cause mortality in CAT patientsanticoagulated with rivaroxaban. Using a Hartung-Knapp random-effects model, the pooled incidence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated foreach end point.RESULTS: Six studies evaluating rivaroxaban for CAT were identified. Of these,three were prospective and three were retrospective. Study sample sizes rangedfrom 41 to 949 patients, and duration of follow-up ranged from 164 to 496 days.The most frequent active cancer sites reported in studies were gastrointestinal(range: 12.0-56.0%), genitourinary (range: 8.6-26.0%), and breast (range:9.3-25.5%). The weighted average incidences of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, andall-cause mortality were 4.2% (95% CI = 2.6-6.6%; I2 = 31%), 2.9% (95% CI =1.6-5.0%; I2 = 59%), and 16.1% (95% CI = 6.0-36.6%; I2 = 96%).CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that incidences of recurrent VTE andmajor bleeding among rivaroxaban-managed patients are not dissimilar to thoseseen in recent randomized trials of anticoagulation in CAT. The pooled incidence for mortality was lower than reported in many anticoagulation CAT trials. Thismay suggest that rivaroxaban is being used in CAT patients who have less severecancer.© 2018 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/phar.2113 PMID: 29604102
