The CH2Cl2:MeOHextract of S. zanzibariensis was initially analysed for its anticancer propertiesagainst three cancer cell lines, renal (TK10), melanoma (UACC62), and breast(MCF7) and was found to be potent at low μg/mL ranges. Compound 1,6α-acetoxy-14-keto-ent-abieta-7(8),13(15)-diene-16,12-olide (mangiolide)inhibited the growth of renal (TK10) with a GI50 of 0.02 μg/mL; a GI50 of0.03 μg/mL for melanoma (UACC62) and a GI50 of 0.05 μg/mL for breast (MCF7)cancer cell lines. Compound 2, 8,13-diepoxy-13,15-ent-abietene-16,12-olide(jolkinolide B) inhibited the growth (GI50) of the cell lines at 3.31 μg/mL forrenal (TK10), 0.94 μg/mL for melanoma (UACC62) and 2.99 μg/mL for the breast(MCF7). The structures were established on the basis of their spectroscopicanalysis and the absolute stereostructures assigned using electronic circulardichroism (ECD).DOI: 10.1080/14786419.2018.1470628 PMID: 29741101
