However, the role of IL-21 in colon cancer remains unclear.OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether IL-21 could inhibit the progression ofcolon cancer in mice; we also explored the mechanisms underlying theimmunological effects of IL-21 in colon cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exogenous IL-21 protein was expressed to treattumor-bearing mice and the production of cytokine interleukin 4, interferon gammaand lambda from CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells were measured, along with thesurvival times of these tumor-bearing mice.RESULTS: Interleukin 21 promoted the secretion of interferon gamma from the CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells and it enhanced the production of interferon lambda by theNK cells. More importantly, IL-21 treatment significantly enhanced antitumoreffects in favor of tumor eradication. We also found that CD8+ T and NK cells arenecessary for the antitumor immune responses elicited by IL-21.CONCLUSIONS: Interleukin 21 is a powerful tool for activating CD8+ T cells and NKcells which exhibit potent cytolytic effector functions and should therefore beexploited for anticancer immunotherapy. Our findings support the development of anovel cytokine immunotherapy against colon cancer.DOI: 10.17219/acem/68703 PMID: 29616746
