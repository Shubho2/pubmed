The existence of cancer stem cells(CSCs) in breast cancer may account for tumor initiation, progression, andmetastasis. Recent studies have reported different effects of cannabinoids oncancer cells via CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. In the present study, theeffects of ACEA (a selective CB1 receptor agonist) and AM251 (a selective CB1antagonist) on CSCs and their parental cells were investigated. Breast CSCsderived from MDA-MB-231 cell line were sorted and characterized withCD44+/CD24-/low/ESA+ phenotype. It was observed that ACEA decreasedCD44+/CD24-/low/ESA+ cancer stem cell invasiveness. Conversely, AM251 increasedthe invasion by more than 20% (at the highest concentrations) in both MDA-MB-231 and CSCs. Our results did not show any correlation between reduced invasion andcytotoxic effects of the drug. Since one of the main cancer recurrence factors isanti-cancer drugs fail to inhibit CSC population, this observation would beuseful for cancer treatment.PMCID: PMC5843309PMID: 29552056
