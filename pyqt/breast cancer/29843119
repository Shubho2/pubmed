These devices may extrude free silicone into surrounding tissue, stimulating a granulomatous foreign body reaction. The resulting mass can mimicbreast cancer.PRESENTATION OF CASE: 71 year old female with a history of a ruptured siliconeimplant presents with an enlarging left breast mass. Exam demonstrated andulcerated, fungating mass with active infection. CT scan demonstrated a23 × 15 cm mass involving the breast and chest wall with axillarylymphadenopathy. Preoperative biopsies were inconclusive and the patientunderwent a modified radical mastectomy. Pathology demonstrated a siliconoma.DISCUSSION: While benign, silicone granulomas of the breast can present similarlyto malignancy and are an important differential in the diagnosis of a breast oraxillary mass for appropriate patients. MRI is the study of choice and coreneedle biopsies cannot always establish the diagnosis preoperatively. PET scanscan be falsely positive and the diagnosis requires an extensive workup to ruleout cancer.CONCLUSION: Siliconomas develop as a result of implant rupture and present withmany of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer. The majority of patients should undergo surgery for symptom relief or to rule out cancer.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..
