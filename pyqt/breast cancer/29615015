Patients often present with late stage disease,resulting in a high mortality rate. This study aims to estimate the prevalence ofbreast -related symptoms in the female population of Burkina Faso. The findingscan be used to advise on adequate diagnostic health services for breast symptoms to ensure early detection and down-staging of breast cancer.METHODS: A cross-sectional, population based study of 996 women was conducted to investigate the proportion of women with breast-related symptoms. Asemi-structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data,information about breast cancer knowledge and details about breast-relatedsymptoms, health care seeking and medical care. Breast-related symptoms werecategorised as currently present/not currently present to estimate the currentprevalence of women requiring a diagnostic service.RESULTS: Among the 996 women, 120 reported having had a breast-related symptom intheir life. Only 36 women sought medical advice and eight women had diagnosticconfirmation by histological or imaging techniques. Current breast-relatedsymptoms were reported by 33 women (3.3% of the sample). An extrapolation toBurkina Faso's female population suggests that 184,562 women are in current need of diagnostic services due to any breast-related symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Imaging techniques at the community and referral level are needed inorder to triage women with breast-related symptoms. Specialised services need to be strengthened to ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment of breast diseases.Education campaigns among the general population and among health careprofessionals are required to increase awareness of breast cancer and improveprompt health care seeking and referral.DOI: 10.1186/s12889-018-5360-6 PMCID: PMC5883529PMID: 29615015
