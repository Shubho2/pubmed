The molecular mechanism by which metastatic cancer are able to recognize, infiltrate, andcolonize bone are still unclear. Chemokines are small soluble proteins whichunder normal physiological conditions mediate chemotactic trafficking ofleukocytes to specific tissues in the body. In the context of metastasis, thebest characterized role for the chemokine system is in the regulation of primary tumor growth, survival, invasion, and homing to specific secondary sites.However, there is ample evidence that metastatic tumors exploit chemokines tomodulate the metastatic niche within bone which ultimately results in osteolytic bone disease. In this review, we examine the role of chemokines in metastatictumor growth within bone. In particular, the chemokines CCL2, CCL3, IL-8/CXCL8,and CXCL12 are consistently involved in promoting osteoclastogenesis and tumorgrowth. We will also evaluate the suitability of chemokines as targets forchemotherapy with the use of neutralizing antibodies and chemokinereceptor-specific antagonists.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00313 PMCID: PMC5999726PMID: 29930538
