We investigated the association between RHR and metabolicrisk factors in stage I-III breast cancer survivors.METHODS: Among 11,013 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2005 and 2013 atthe Severance hospital in Seoul, Korea, a total of 4980 patients met ourinclusion criteria for the final analysis. Multivariable linear regressions were used to examine the association between RHR and metabolic risk factors, includingsystolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), glucose,triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, high density lipid cholesterol (HDLC), and low density lipid cholesterol.RESULTS: The results showed that RHR had significant linear associations with SBP(p = .02), DBP (p < .001), TG (p < .001), glucose (p < .001), and HDL-C(p < .001). Compared to participants in the lowest quintile of RHR (<68 beat per min (bpm)), participants in the highest quintile (≥85 bpm) had higher DBP by4 mmHg, TG by 13 mg/dl, and glucose by 5 mg/dl after adjusting for potentialconfounders. Further subgroup analyses showed that the association of RHR maydiffer by age and menopausal status for fasting glucose and cancer stage,chemotherapy, estrogen and progesterone receptor status for TG.CONCLUSIONS: We observed a strong positive association of RHR with fastingglucose, TG, and DBP in breast cancer survivors, which may potentially explainthe association between RHR and breast cancer prognosis.Copyright © 2018.
