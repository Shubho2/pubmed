However, checkpoint blockade immunotherapy suffers from a lowresponse rate due to insufficient tumor immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITM). In this study, a tumor-microenvironment-activatablebinary cooperative prodrug nanoparticle (BCPN) is rationally designed to improve immunotherapy by synergistically modulating the immune tumor microenvironment.BCPN is purely constructed from a tumor acidity and reduction dual-responsiveoxaliplatin (OXA) prodrug for triggering immunogenic cell death (ICD) andeliciting antitumor immunity, and a reduction-activatable homodimer of NLG919 forinactivating indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, which is a key regulator for ITM.Upon tumor-acidity-triggered cleavage of the poly(ethylene glycol) shell, PNshows negative to positive charge switch for enhanced tumor accumulation and deeppenetration. OXA and NLG919 are then activated in the tumor cells viaglutathione-mediated reduction. It is demonstrate that activated OXA promotesintratumoral accumulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by triggering ICD of cancer cells. Meanwhile, NLG919 downregulates IDO-1-mediated immunosuppression andsuppresses regulatory T cells. Most importantly, PN shows much higher efficiency than free OXA or the combination of free OXA and NLG919 to regress tumor growthand prevent metastasis of mouse models of both breast and colorectal cancer.Â© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
