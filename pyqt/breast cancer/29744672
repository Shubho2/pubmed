Patients received intravenous liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2,cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, paclitaxel 120 mg/m2, and bevacizumab 8 mg/kg on day 1 of 15-day cycles for four cycles (four administrations as neoadjuvanttreatment). The primary endpoint was complete clinical (cCR) and pathologic (pCR)response rates, while secondary endpoints included safety, breast-conservingsurgery (BCS) conversion rate, and disease-free survival (DFS).RESULTS: Sixty-two women were enrolled; 20 were ER/PR+ and 42 had TNBC. Allunderwent surgery, six received mastectomy, and 56 (90.3%) received BCS, with an equal conversion rate from initial indication for mastectomy. cCR was 25.8%. pCR in the breast and axilla occurred in 24 patients (38.7%). pCR was 42.9% for TNBC and 30% for ER/PR+. Hematologic adverse events (AEs) included neutropenia (74.2% total; 22.6% grade 3 [G3]) and febrile neutropenia (6.5% G3); non-hematologic G3 AEs included nausea (6.5%), mucositis (9.7%), and infection (3.2%), all of which were managed without negative sequelae. Over a 3-year follow-up, all patientswere alive and DFS was 87.1%.CONCLUSION: PLAC-B as neoadjuvant treatment of this subpopulation with TNBC andER/PR+ patients is effective and safe. Further studies are necessitated.DOI: 10.1007/s40261-018-0655-z PMID: 29744672
