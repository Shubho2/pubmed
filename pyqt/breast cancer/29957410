Electronic address:icorreia@tecnico.ulisboa.pt.A new ZnL2 complex containing two molecules of a tridentate Schiff base derivedfrom 5-methyl-1H-pyrazole (HL) is synthesized and characterized. Thephotophysical properties of HL and ZnL2 are disclosed and supported by CAMB3LYPDFT/TDDFT calculations. It is shown that there is keto-tautomer stabilizationupon excitation with an energetically accessible triplet state in HL, not presentin ZnL2, this explaining the differences found in the emissions of the compounds.The intrinsic fluorescence of ZnL2 is used as probe for a detailed study of itsbinding to human serum albumin. The protein-complex association isthermodynamically favourable and it is shown by fluorescence quenching andtime-resolved analysis that the fluorescence quenching involves a mixed mechanismwith prevalence of static quenching, which corroborates adduct formation at site I, close to the Trp214 residue. The ability of ZnL2 to bind DNA was alsoevaluated, as well as its cytotoxic activity against MCF7 (breast), PC3(prostate) cancer cells and hamster V79 fibroblasts. ZnL2 is a moderate DNAintercalator (Kapp = 3.9 × 104 M-1) and depicts a quite low IC50 value at 48 hagainst MCF7 cells (IC50 = 530 nM), but much higher for PC3 and V79 cells. Therelevance of a more careful speciation evaluation of ZnL2 and other potentialmetal-based drugs in incubation media used in in vitro tests is highlighted.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
