The tumor lesion, the breast, thefibroglandular and fatty tissue were segmented using well-established methods.The whole breast fat percentage and the peri-tumor interface fat percentage were measured. Three shells (SH1, SH2, SH3) surrounding the convex hall of the threedimensional (3D) tumor were defined and in each shell the volumetric percentageof fat was calculated. The peri-tumor interface fat percentage and the volumetricpercentage of fat in the three peri-tumoral shells were compared among different subtypes.RESULTS: In the TN group, the fat percentage on the tumor boundary was 43 ± 20%and 78 ± 12% for two dimensional (2D) and 3D measurement, respectively, whichwere the highest among the three subtypes but not significantly different. Thefat percentage in SH2 and SH3 in the TN group was 82 ± 7% and 85 ± 7%, which was significantly higher compared to the two other two subtypes. The results remainedafter controlling for the whole breast fat percentage.CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a feasible method for quantitative analysis ofperi-tumoral tissue characteristics. Because of small patient number, the findingthat TN tumors had the highest peri-tumor fat content among the three subtypesneeds to be further verified with a large cohort study.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
