Primarily expressed inproliferating cells, UHRF1 is a cell-cycle regulated protein that is required forS phase entry. Furthermore, UHRF1 participates in transcriptional gene regulationby connecting DNA methylation to histone modifications. Upregulation of UHRF1 mayserve as a biomarker for a variety of cancers; including breast, gastric,prostate, lung and colorectal carcinoma. To this end, overexpression of UHRF1promotes cancer metastasis by triggering aberrant patterns of DNA methylation,and subsequently, silencing tumor suppressor genes. Various small moleculeeffectors of UHRF1 have been reported in the literature, although the mechanismof action may not be fully characterized. Small molecules that potentially bindto the SRA domain may affect the ability of UHRF1 to bind hemimethylated DNA;thereby reducing aberrant DNA methylation. Therefore, in a subset of cancers,small molecule UHRF1 inhibitors may restore normal gene expression and serve asuseful anti-cancer therapeutics.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25425 PMCID: PMC5995235PMID: 29899856
