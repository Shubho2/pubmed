China.Breast cancer affects ~10% of women worldwide and is responsible for ~12% of all cancer-associated mortalities. Breast cancer is more prone to metastasis comparedwith other types of cancer. Up to 5% of patients with breast cancer present with incurable metastasis and an additional 10-15% of patients develop metastaseswithin 3 years of their initial diagnosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs,21-25 nucleotides in length, that have been shown to significantly affect geneexpression. In total >2,000 miRNAs have been identified and specific miRNAs have been revealed to be associated with cancer. In the present study, we observedthat the majority of breast cancer specimens collected expressed low levels ofmiR-202 compared with adjacent tissues and normal cell lines. Mechanisticinvestigations identified KRAS as a potential target gene of miR-202 and it wasdemonstrated that miR-202 exerted its tumor-suppressive effects by regulating theexpression of KRAS in breast cancer cells. Functional assays revealed thatmiR-202 significantly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion invitro. In summary, these results indicate the function of miR-202 in breastcancer progression and suggest that its use within breast cancer therapy ispromising.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8726 PMCID: PMC6019912PMID: 29963190
