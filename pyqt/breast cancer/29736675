Theaim of the present study was to investigate how flap thickness in a modified starflap influences the resulting reconstructed nipple and achieves an appropriateflap width in design.METHODS: Sixty-three patients who underwent nipple reconstruction using amodified star flap following implant-based breast reconstruction between August2014 and July 2016 were included in this case-controlled study. The length oflaterally diverging flaps was 1.5 times their width. The thickness of each flapwas measured using ultrasonography, and the average thickness was defined as the flap thickness. We investigated the correlation between the resultingreconstructed nipple and flap thickness, and the difference of the change in the reconstructed nipple projection after using a thin or thick flap.RESULTS: The average flap thickness was 3.8 ± 1.7 (range 2.5-6.0) mm. There was asignificant, linear correlation between the flap thickness and resultingreconstructed nipple projection (β = 0.853, p < 0.01). Furthermore, thedifference between the thin and thick flaps in the resulting reconstructed nippleprojection was significant (p < 0.01).CONCLUSION: Measuring the flap thickness preoperatively may allow surgeons toachieve an appropriate flap width; otherwise, alternative methods for higherprojection might be used.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level ofevidence to each article.
