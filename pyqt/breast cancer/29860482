To determine if these commitments have resulted in improved cancercontrol, quantitative assessments of the cancer burden are required.Objective: To assess the burden for 29 cancer groups over time to provide aframework for policy discussion, resource allocation, and research focus.Evidence Review: Cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were evaluated for 195countries and territories by age and sex using the Global Burden of Disease studyestimation methods. Levels and trends were analyzed over time, as well as by the Sociodemographic Index (SDI). Changes in incident cases were categorized bychanges due to epidemiological vs demographic transition.Findings: In 2016, there were 17.2 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.9 milliondeaths. Cancer cases increased by 28% between 2006 and 2016. The smallestincrease was seen in high SDI countries. Globally, population aging contributed17%; population growth, 12%; and changes in age-specific rates, -1% to thischange. The most common incident cancer globally for men was prostate cancer (1.4million cases). The leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs was tracheal,bronchus, and lung cancer (1.2 million deaths and 25.4 million DALYs). For women,the most common incident cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs was breast cancer (1.7 million incident cases, 535 000 deaths, and 14.9 millionDALYs). In 2016, cancer caused 213.2 million DALYs globally for both sexescombined. Between 2006 and 2016, the average annual age-standardized incidencerates for all cancers combined increased in 130 of 195 countries or territories, and the average annual age-standardized death rates decreased within thattimeframe in 143 of 195 countries or territories.Conclusions and Relevance: Large disparities exist between countries in cancerincidence, deaths, and associated disability. Scaling up cancer prevention andensuring universal access to cancer care are required for health equity and tofulfill the global commitments for noncommunicable disease and cancer control.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.2706 PMID: 29860482
