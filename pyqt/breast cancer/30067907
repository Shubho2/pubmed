[Epub ahead of print]Transition-Metal Free Arylation and Alkylation of Diarylmethyl p-Tolyl Sulfoneswith Zinc Reagents.Miao M, Yin W, Wang L, Chen Z, Xu J, Ren H.The transition-metal free synthesis of unsymmetrical and highly functionalizedtriarylmethanes through arylation of the situ generated o-QMs from diarylmethylp-tolyl sulfones with aryl zinc reagents is described. Alkyl zinc reagents arealso well tolerated in this reaction. Additionally, the straightforward synthesisof the analogue of the anti-tuberculosis agent A and the key precursor of theanti-breast cancer agent B are achieved by this strategy.DOI: 10.1021/acs.joc.8b01428 PMID: 30067907
