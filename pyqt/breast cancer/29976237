Baltimore Street,Baltimore, MD, USA.BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are the major players in themetastatic process. A potential mechanism of cell migration and invasion is theformation of microtentacles in tumor cells. These structures are supported byα-tubulin (TUB), detyrosinated α-tubulin (GLU), and vimentin (VIM). In thecurrent study, we evaluated the expression of those cytoskeletal proteins inCTCs.METHODS: Forty patients with breast cancer (BC) (16 early and 24 metastatic) wereenrolled in the study. CTCs were isolated using the ISET platform and stainedwith the following combinations of antibodies: pancytokeratin (CK)/VIM/TUB andCK/VIM/GLU. Samples were analyzed with the ARIOL platform and confocal laserscanning microscopy.RESULTS: Fluorescence quantification revealed that the ratios CK/TUB, CK/VIM, andCK/GLU were statistically increased in MCF7 compared with more aggressive celllines (SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231). In addition, all of these ratios were statisticallyincreased in MCF7 cells compared with metastatic BC patients' CTCs (p = 0.0001,p = 0.0001, and p = 0.003, respectively). Interestingly, intercellularconnections among CTCs and between CTCs and blood cells through cytoskeletonbridges were revealed, whereas microtentacles were increased in patients with CTCclusters. These intercellular connections were supported by TUB, VIM, and GLU.Quantification of the examined molecules revealed that the median intensity ofTUB, GLU, and VIM was significantly increased in patients with metastatic BCcompared with those with early disease (TUB, 62.27 vs 11.5, p = 0.0001; GLU, 6.99vs 5.29, p = 0.029; and VIM, 8.24 vs 5.38, p = 0.0001, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: CTCs from patients with BC aggregate to each other and to bloodcells through cytoskeletal protrusions, supported by VIM, TUB, and GLU.Quantification of these molecules could potentially identify CTCs related to moreaggressive disease.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0993-z PMCID: PMC6034292PMID: 29976237
