We present a case of a 19-year-old woman who had a right breast lump for six months with the above diagnosis together with a mini-reviewof the literature. Ultrasound revealed a 5-cm breast lump and core biopsyrevealed ductal carcinoma in situ. She underwent wide local excision of thebreast lump with clear margins. Final histology confirmed ductal carcinoma insitu within a fibroepithelial lesion consistent with a benign phyllodes tumour.To our knowledge, this is the youngest case of ductal carcinoma in situ arisingin a phyllodes tumour to have been reported so far.DOI: 10.1308/rcsann.2018.0024 PMCID: PMC5958862 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29484937  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
