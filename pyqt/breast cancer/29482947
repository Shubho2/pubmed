Atotal of 50 patients and 25 healthy controls were enrolled in our study.Genotyping of rs4880, rs4244285, and rs1801274 were examined in association with breast cancer in Iraqi women.RESULTS: We found that individuals carrying the CT genotype of rs4880 manifested an increased risk of breast cancer compared with those carrying the TT genotype(odds ratio [OR], 0.171; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.053-0.551; P = .002). Inthe dominant model, we observed that the CT and CC genotype of rs4880 showed anincreased risk of breast cancer compared with the TT genotype (OR, 0.248; 95% CI,0.089-0.690; P = .006). Moreover, subjects with the GA genotype of rs4244285presented a higher risk of breast cancer than the GG genotype (OR, 0.256; 95% CI,0.066-0.987; P = .038) and dominant models (OR, 0.025; 95% CI, 0.054-0.775; P =.013).CONCLUSION: The analysis revealed that rs1801274 showed linkage disequilibriumand decreased risk of breast cancer. In conclusion, our study suggests thatrs4880 and rs4244285 polymorphisms play an important role in development ofbreast cancer in an Iraqi population, and no significant association was foundbetween rs1801274 and the risk of breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
