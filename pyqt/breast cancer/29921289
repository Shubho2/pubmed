Weinvestigated the specific role of increased SNAI2 expression infulvestrant-resistant cells by gene knockdown and treatment with a SNAIL-p53binding inhibitor, and evaluated the effect on cell growth, migration andexpression of EMT markers. Furthermore, we evaluated SNAI2 expression byimmunohistochemical analysis in metastatic samples from two cohorts of patientswith breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy in the advanced setting.RESULTS: SNAI2 was found to be significantly upregulated in allendocrine-resistant cells compared to parental cell lines, while no changes were observed in the expression of other EMT-associated transcription factors. SNAI2knockdown with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) converted themesenchymal-like fulvestrant-resistant cells into an epithelial-like phenotypeand reduced cell motility. Furthermore, inhibition of SNAI2 with specific siRNAor a SNAIL-p53 binding inhibitor reduced growth of cells resistant to fulvestranttreatment. Clinical evaluation of SNAI2 expression in two independent cohorts of patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy in the advanced setting (N = 86 and N = 67) showed that high SNAI2 expression in themetastasis correlated significantly with shorter progression-free survival onendocrine treatment (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.004).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SNAI2 is a key regulator of the aggressive phenotype observed in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells, an independentprognostic biomarker in ER+ advanced breast cancer treated with endocrinetherapy, and may be a promising therapeutic target in combination with endocrine therapies in ER+ metastatic breast cancer exhibiting high SNAI2 levels.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0988-9 PMCID: PMC6009053PMID: 29921289
