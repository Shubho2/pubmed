Using theHealthy Lifestyle Index, Arthur and colleagues analyzed the joint impacts ofdiet, alcohol, smoking, physical activity, and obesity on breast cancer risk, andsubtypes, in postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative. The analysis provides data for population-attributable risk estimations and futureprevention trials to target multiple risk factors. The public health messages forthe individual risk factors remain unchanged, however, and it is still not clear whether improving one risk factor can counteract the adverse effects of another.
