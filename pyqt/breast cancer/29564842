However, publishedresults have not been quantitatively summarized or examined for potentialexercise-moderating variables. We conducted this review to summarize and quantifythe effect-size of exercise on BT outcomes in preclinical studies. A literaturesearch was performed in MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science and System forInformation on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) databases. Risk of bias wasassessed using SYRCLE's RoB tool. A total of 116 correlations were performed toanalyze 28 preclinical studies published through December 2016, which included2,085 animals and 51 exercise programs. Positive effects of small, medium andlarge magnitude were observed in tumor incidence, growth and multiplicity,respectively. In the tumor microenvironment, positive effects of large magnitude were also observed in proliferation and apoptosis but not in angiogenesis.Moderator variables correlated with higher intervention effects were identifiedalong with a considerable heterogeneity in exercise protocols that precluded usfrom clearly perceiving the benefits of exercise exposure. In conclusion,exercise performed under specific conditions benefits BT outcomes. Preclinicalstudies with exercise designs mimicking exercise exposure that can be used inclinical contexts are needed.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.DOI: 10.1055/s-0044-101149 PMID: 29564842  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
