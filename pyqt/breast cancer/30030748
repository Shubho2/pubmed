[Epub ahead of print]Analysing the ethics of breast cancer overdiagnosis: a pathogenic vulnerability.Rogers WA(1).Author information: (1)Department of Philosophy and Department of Clinical Medicine, MacquarieUniversity, North Ryde, NSW, 2107, Australia. wendy.rogers@mq.edu.au.Breast cancer screening aims to help women by early identification and treatment of cancers that might otherwise be life-threatening. However, breast cancerscreening also leads to the detection of some cancers that, if left undetectedand untreated, would not have damaged the health of the women concerned. At thetime of diagnosis, harmless cancers cannot be identified as non-threatening,therefore women are offered invasive breast cancer treatment. This phenomenon of identifying (and treating) non-harmful cancers is called overdiagnosis.Overdiagnosis is morally problematic as it leads to overall patient harm ratherthan benefit. Further, breast cancer screening is offered in a context thatexaggerates cancer risk and screening benefit, minimises risk of harm and impedesinformed choice. These factors combine to create pathogenic vulnerability. Thatis, breast cancer screening exacerbates rather than reduces women's vulnerabilityand undermines women's agency. This paper provides an original way ofconceptualising agency-supporting responses to the harms of breast canceroverdiagnosis through application of the concept of pathogenic vulnerability.DOI: 10.1007/s11019-018-9852-z PMID: 30030748
