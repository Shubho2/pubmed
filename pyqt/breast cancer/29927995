A prospective study among 1856 French women.Bertaut A(1), Coudert J(2), Bengrine L(2), Dancourt V(3), Binquet C(4)(5),Douvier S(6).Author information: (1)Methodology and Biostatistics Unit, Centre Georges François Leclerc, Dijon,France.(2)Medical Oncology Unit, Centre Georges François Leclerc, Dijon, France.(3)ADECA 21-58, « Association pour le dépistage des cancers Côte-d'Or », Dijon,France.(4)INSERM U1231-EPICAD Team, Burgundy-Franche Comte University, Dijon, France.(5)INSERM CIC1432, University Hospital, Dijon, France.(6)Department of Gynecologic and Oncologic Surgery, University Hospital, Dijon,France.BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine participation rates and factors associated withparticipation in colorectal (fecal occul blood test) and cervical cancer(Pap-smear) screening among a population of women participating in breast cancer screening.METHODS: From August to October 2015, a self-administered questionnaire was sent by post to 2 900 women aged 50-65, living in Côte-d'Or, France, and who were upto date with mammogram screening. Polytomic logistic regression was used toidentify correlates of participation in both cervical and colorectal cancerscreenings. Participation in all 3 screenings was chosen as the reference.RESULTS: Study participation rate was 66.3% (n = 1856). Besides being compliantwith mammogram, respectively 78.3% and 56.6% of respondents were up to date forcervical and colorectal cancer screenings, while 46.2% were compliant with the 3 screenings. Consultation with a gynecologist in the past year was associated withhigher chance of undergoing the 3 screenings or female cancer screenings(p<10-4), when consultation with a GP was associated with higher chance ofundergoing the 3 screenings or organized cancer screenings (p<0.05).Unemployment, obesity, age>59 and yearly flu vaccine were associated with a lowerinvolvement in cervical cancer screening. Women from high socio-economic classes were more likely to attend only female cancer screenings (p = 0.009). Finally, a low level of physical activity and tobacco use were associated with higher riskof no additional screening participation (p<10-3 and p = 0.027).CONCLUSIONS: Among women participating in breast screening, colorectal andcervical cancer screening rates could be improved. Including communication about these 2 cancer screenings in the mammogram invitation could be worth to explore.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198939 PMCID: PMC6013094PMID: 29927995
