We profiled DNA methylation with ERRBS (EnhancedReduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing) across four main stages of tumorprogression in the MMTV-PyMT mouse model (hyperplasia, adenoma/mammaryintraepithelial neoplasia, early carcinoma and late carcinoma), during whichmalignant transition occurs. We identified a large number of differentiallymethylated cytosines (DMCs) in tumors relative to age-matched normal mammaryglands from FVB mice. Despite similarities, the methylation differences of thepremalignant stages were distinct from the malignant ones. Many differentiallymethylated loci were preserved from the first to the last stage throughout tumor progression. Genes affected by methylation gains were enriched in Polycombrepressive complex 2 (PRC2) targets, which may present biomarkers for earlydiagnosis and targets for treatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-24005-x PMCID: PMC5882905PMID: 29615825
