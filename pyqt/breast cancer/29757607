The pH-dependent cleavageof the shell is demonstrated at pH 5.0 and 6.5 using 1H NMR. Bortezomib (BTZ, an anticancer drug containing a phenylboronic acid group) is conjugated to thepolymers through formation of pH-responsive boronate ester bond between boronicacid and catechol in the polymers. Dual pH-responsive bortezomib-polymerconjugates (BTZ-PC) self-assemble into micellar nanoparticles of small size (<110nm) with narrow size distribution and high drug loading capacity. Acidic pHaccelerates BTZ release from BTZ-PC micelles and enhances intracelluar uptake of the micelles, hence increasing in vitro cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cells. More importantly, the BTZ-PC micelles achieve a stronger antitumor effect in a human breast cancer BT-474 xenograft mouse model than free BTZ and mitigate in vivo hepatotoxicity of BTZ. These dual pH-responsive shell-cleavablenanoparticles are a potentially promising carrier for BTZ delivery.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b01954 PMID: 29757607
