However, the association between efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy and hormone receptor (HR) status is stillunclear. Here we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)to address this issue in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. PubMed andEMBASE were searched from inception to October 2017 for studies involvingtrastuzumab, lapatinib, pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine and neratinib. Efficacyendpoints were pathological complete response (pCR) for neoadjuvant therapy anddisease-free survival (DFS) for adjuvant therapy. In neoadjuvant setting, pCR wasreported in 7 trials with 2868 subjects. Hormone receptor (HR)-negative womenderived substantially greater benefit from HER2-targeted agents than didHR-positive patients (odds ratio (OR), 2.34; 95% confidence interval (CI),1.99-2.75). Additionally, the impact of HR status on pCR was independent ofanti-HER2 agents. In adjuvant setting, DFS was investigated in 7 studies with12,768 patients. HR-positive patients benefit more from anti-HER2 treatment than did HR-negative subjects (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.89). Moreover, patients whodid not receive any endocrine or anti-HER2 neoadjuvant treatment showed similaroutcome but with a smaller effect (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.99). In summary,compared with HER2-positive/HR-negative subjects, HER2-positive/HR-positivepatients achieved greater benefit from HER2-targeted treatment although theefficacy from neoadjuvant therapy was relatively poor.Â© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-18-0029 PMID: 29739815
