Loss of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB1) function has been suggested as acardinal feature of breast cancers that are more sensitive to chemotherapy andconversely resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors. We performed a retrospective analysis exploring RBsig, a gene signature of RB loss, as a potential predictive marker ofresponse to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER+/HER2+ breast cancer patients.METHODS: We selected clinical trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± anti-HER2therapy in HER2+ breast cancer patients with available information on geneexpression data, hormone receptor status, and pathological complete response(pCR) rates. RBsig expression was computed in silico and correlated with pCR.RESULTS: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in theanalysis (514 patients). Overall, of 211 ER+/HER2+ breast cancer patients, 49achieved pCR (23%). The pCR rate following chemotherapy ± anti-HER2 drugs inpatients with RBsig low expression was significantly lower compared to patientswith RBsig high expression (16% vs. 30%, respectively; Fisher's exact testp = 0.015). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.62 (p = 0.005). In the 303ER-negative (ER-)/HER2+ patients treated with chemotherapy ± anti-HER2 drugs, thepCR rate was 43%. No correlation was found between RBsig expression and pCR rate in this group.CONCLUSIONS: Low expression of RBsig identifies a subset of ER+/HER2+ patientswith low pCR rates following neoadjuvant chemotherapy ± anti-HER2 therapy. These patients may potentially be spared chemotherapy in favor of anti-HER2, endocrine therapy, and CDK 4/6 inhibitor combinations.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4766-2 PMID: 29564743
