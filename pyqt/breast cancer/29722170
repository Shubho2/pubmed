We identified 501,631 female patients from 2000 to 2013 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Theseidentified patients included patients with PD (n = 469), patients with PD-IDC(n = 1832), and patients with PD-DCIS (n = 1130) and infiltrating ductalcarcinoma (IDC) (n = 498,076). Then, we compared the clinical characteristics of these patients with those who were diagnosed with IDC during the same period. Theoutcomes of these subtypes of breast carcinoma were different. Based on theoverall survival, the patients with PD-IDC had the worst prognosis (5-yearsurvival rate = 84.1%). The PD-DCIS had the best prognosis (5-year survivalrate = 97.5%). Besides, among patients with Paget disease, the one who wasmarried had a better prognosis than who were not. And, according to our research,the marital status was associated with the hormone receptor status in patientswith PD-IDC. Among three subtypes of Paget disease, patients with PD-IDC had the worst prognosis. Besides, patients who were unmarried had worse outcomes. And themarital status of patients with PD-IDC is associated with hormone status. Theobservation underscores the importance of individualized treatment.© 2018 The Authors.
