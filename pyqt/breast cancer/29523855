The methods we describe are based on areal-time PCR including a mutation specific primer combined with a non-productiveoligonucleotide which inhibits wild-type amplification and a parallel internalcontrol reaction. We demonstrate consistent detection of PIK3CA H1047R mutant DNAin genomic DNA extracted from frozen breast cancer biopsies, FFPE material orcancer cell lines with a detection sensitivity of approximately 5% mutant allele fraction and validate these results using both Sanger sequencing and deep nextgeneration sequencing methods. The detection sensitivity for PIK3CA E545Kmutation was approximately 10%. We propose these methods as simple, fast andinexpensive diagnostic tools to determine PIK3CA mutation status.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22473-9 PMCID: PMC5844869PMID: 29523855
