As a result, ectopic breast tissue can develop anywhere along this ridge, which extends from the axilla-the most common location-to the groin. Primary breast cancer in accessory breast tissue isuncommon but has been reported in multiple prior studies. We present a rare case of inflammatory breast cancer presenting in upper abdominal accessory breasttissue in women with a personal history of ipsilateral breast cancer, andhighlight the challenges of both diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer inaccessory breast tissue.DOI: 10.1016/j.radcr.2017.08.008 PMCID: PMC5823292PMID: 29484038
