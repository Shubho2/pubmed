Theintra- and inter-observer agreements were calculated and compared for eachmethod.Results: The weighted kappa values for the overall intra-observer agreement were 0.955 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.931-0.980) and 0.938 (95% CI: 0.907-0.968)when breast densities were assessed according to criteria outlined in the fourth and fifth ACR BI-RADS editions, respectively. The difference between these valueswas not statistically significant (p = .4). The overall Fleiss-Cohen (quadratic) weighted kappa for inter-observer agreement were 0.623 (95% CI: 0.517-0.729) and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.589-0.815) when breast densities were assessed according tocriteria outlined in the fourth and fifth ACR BI-RADS editions, respectively. Thedifference between these values was not statistically significant (p = .32).Similarly, there were no significant differences in the evaluation of breastdensity (overall) when comparing breast density assignment using criteriaoutlined in the fourth and fifth ACR BI-RADS edition (p = .582).Conclusion: The ACR BI-RADS guideline is an acceptable method to classify breast density, resulting in substantial inter-observer agreements using criteriaoutlined in both the fourth and fifth editions. The intra-observer agreement was nearly perfect for radiologists using criteria outlined in both sets ofguidelines. Moreover, although the percentage of women who were classified ashaving dense breasts was higher when radiologists used the fifth edition of ACRBI-RADS guidelines than when they used the fourth edition, this difference wasnot statistically significant.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejro.2018.04.002 PMCID: PMC5918175PMID: 29707614
