Pegfilgrastim reduces the risk of neutropenic fever but commonlycauses bone pain.OBJECTIVE: Evaluate whether a reduced dose of pegfilgrastim (3 mg) reduced thefrequency of bone pain without compromising efficacy.METHODS: Records reviewed from breast cancer patients who received at least one3 mg dose of pegfilgrastim, white blood count (WBC), and absolute granulocytecounts (AGC) were collected. Musculoskeletal pain scale was collected at eachvisit.RESULTS: 265 treatments from 36 women were analyzed. There was no difference inpost-treatment AGC between 3 versus 6 mg. Leukocytosis (WBC > 20,000 cells/cu mm)was more likely for those treated with 6 mg (chi-square 5.265, p = 0.0215). Therewas higher change in bone pain in patients who received 6 mg doses compared tonone or 3 mg.LIMITATIONS: In this retrospective, non-randomized study, we found the majorityof patients received the reduced 3 mg dose after intolerance to the 6 mg dose. Itis unknown if smaller or larger doses than 3 mg would achieve similar results or whether 3 mg dose would be effective as an initial therapy or for patientsreceiving different chemotherapy regimens. Pain is observed despite premedicationwith naproxen and/or loratidine.CONCLUSION: Reduced dose of pegfilgrastim 3 mg was less likely to cause bonepain. The reduced dose was not associated with a significant difference inpost-treatment AGC or rate of serious infection.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3607-7 PMID: 29869680
