Here we present a pipeline to develop glycoproteins from extracellular vesicles (EVs) through integrating quantitative glycoproteomics with a novelreverse phase glycoprotein array and then apply it to identify novel biomarkersfor breast cancer. EV glycoproteomics show promise in circumventing the problems plaguing current serum/plasma glycoproteomics and allowed us to identify hundredsof glycoproteins that have not been identified in blood. We identified 1,453unique glycopeptides representing 556 glycoproteins in EVs, among which 20 wereverified significantly higher in individual breast cancer patients. We furtherapplied a novel glyco-specific reverse phase protein array to quantify a subsetof the candidates. Together, this study demonstrates the great potential of this integrated pipeline for biomarker discovery.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01090 PMID: 29629753
