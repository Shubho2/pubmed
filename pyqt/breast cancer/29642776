Epub2018 Apr 11.The Pink Underside: The Commercialization of Medical Risk Assessment andDecision-Making Tools for Hereditary Breast Cancer Risk.Hesse-Biber S(1), Flynn B(1), Farrelly K(1).Author information: (1)1 Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, USA.The growth of the Internet since the millennium has opened up a myriad ofopportunities for education, particularly in medicine. Although those looking forhealth care information used to have to turn to a face-to-face doctor's visit, animmense library of medical advice is now available at their fingertips. The BRCA genetic predispositions (mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer genes)which expose men and women to greater risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers can be researched extensively online. Several nonprofit organizations now offeronline risk assessment and decision-making tools meant to supplement conversationwith medical professionals, which in actuality are quickly replacing it. We arguehere through a critical qualitative template analysis of several such tools that the discursive frameworks utilized are prone to fearmongering, commercialization,and questionable validity. Left unchecked, these assessment tools could do moreharm than good in driving young women especially to take unnecessary extremesurgical action.DOI: 10.1177/1049732318767395 PMID: 29642776
