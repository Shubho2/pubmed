Although, amplification of ERBB2 has been reported indifferent studies; however, the association between changes in mitochondrial DNA content and the ERBB2 gene copy number is poorly understood. The relativemitochondrial DNA content of breast cancer tumor tissues of 70 patients who were referred to Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex was determined using quantitativeReal-time PCR. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) wasconducted to evaluate the ERBB2 gene copy number variation and finally,two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test was used to investigate thepossible association between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and the ERBB2 geneamplification. Seventeen out of 70 breast cancer tumor tissues were found withERBB2 gene amplification. Comparison of the mitochondrial DNA content of theaforementioned samples with the rest of the cases showed a significant decreasein the mitochondrial DNA content of the ERBB2-amplified samples (P=0.01). Ourdata provided evidence that ERBB2 have the potential to have a regulatory roleover mitochondrial activity by controlling the mtDNA content.DOI: 10.17179/excli2017-819 PMCID: PMC5938539PMID: 29743853
