The metabolicchanges accompanying obesity decrease androgens and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby increasing available oestrogens. The higher rates of MBC in Northand Equatorial Africa are largely due to liver damage from endemic bilharziasisand hepatitis B causing elevated oestradiol (E2) levels from hepatic conversionof androgen. Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) is associated with a 50-fold increasein incidence of MBC compared with XY males, and this is the most pronouncedevidence for testicular malfunction amplifying risk. Delay in presentation means that up to 40% of cases have stage III or stage IV disease at diagnosis. Norandomised controlled trials have been reported on endocrine treatment ofadvanced disease or adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy following or preceding surgery. Tamoxifen is the most effective endocrine therapy, but side effects can lead tonon-compliance in a substantial number of men. Aromatase inhibitors are lesseffective because they do not inhibit testicular oestrogen production. There isan urgent need for collaborative trials to provide an evidence base for the most effective endocrine and least toxic therapies for men with breast cancer.Â© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-18-0117 PMID: 29752333
