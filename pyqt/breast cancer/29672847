N-WASP mediates invasion of cancer cells in vitroand its depletion reduces invasion and metastatic dissemination of breast cancer.Given this role in cancer invasion and universal expression in thegastrointestinal tract, we explored a role for N-WASP in the initiation andprogression of colorectal cancer. While deletion of N-wasp is not detectablyharmful in the murine intestinal tract, numbers of Paneth cells increased,indicating potential changes in the stem cell niche, and migration up thecrypt-villus axis was enhanced. Loss of N-wasp promoted adenoma formation in anadenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) deletion model of intestinal tumourigenesis.Thus, we establish a tumour suppressive role of N-WASP in early intestinalcarcinogenesis despite its later pro-invasive role in other cancers. Our studyhighlights that while the actin cytoskeletal machinery promotes invasion ofcancer cells, it also maintains normal epithelial tissue function and thus mayhave tumour suppressive roles in pre-neoplastic tissues. © 2018 The Authors.
