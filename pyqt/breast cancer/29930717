China.Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) is a transcription factor with awell-defined role in stem cell pluripotency. Two OCT4 isoforms, OCT4A and OCT4B, tend to be downregulated as normal cells differentiate. However, OCT4,particularly OCT4B, may become reactivated in cancer cells. Despite thisobservation, the exact function of OCT4B re-expression in cancer is unclear. Inthe present study, the role of OCT4 in breast cancer cells was determined. Inparticular, the ability of OCT4 to regulate key genes involved in cellularproliferation and apoptosis, two pathways that are frequently deregulated incancer, was examined. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A locus encodesp16INK4a and p14ARF, two important cell cycle inhibitors. The tumor suppressorp53 also has well characterized roles in suppressing proliferation and promoting apoptosis. The present study demonstrated, via overexpression and geneticknockdown techniques, that OCT4B regulates the expression of several of thesegenes and ultimately regulates the rate of apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancercells. It was also observed that, while OCT4B and OCT4A regulate one another, it is OCT4B that serves a more prominent role in regulating the transcription ofdownstream genes. Taken together, the present results suggest that OCT4B isre-expressed in a number of breast cancer cell lines, where it affects both thetranscription of cell cycle genes and the rate of apoptosis. These properties of OCT4B may depend on, at least in part, the co-function of OCT4A.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8607 PMCID: PMC6006504PMID: 29930717
