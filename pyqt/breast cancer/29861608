Images were interpreted using the Breast ImagingReporting and Data System (BI-RADS). Women in the BI-RADS categories 1-2 wereconsidered negative. Women classified as BI-RADS 3 underwent magnetic resonanceimaging to distinguish true- and false-negative results. Core aspiration orsurgical biopsy was performed in women classified as BI-RADS 4-5, followed by apathological diagnosis. Kappa values and agreement rates were calculated between ABUS, HHUS and MG.Results: A total of 1,973 women were included in the final analysis. Of these,1,353 (68.6%) and 620 (31.4%) were classified as BI-RADS categories 1-3 and 4-5, respectively. In the older age group, the agreement rate and Kappa value between the ABUS and HHUS were 94.0% and 0.860 (P<0.001), respectively; they were 89.2%and 0.735 (P<0.001) between the ABUS and MG, respectively. Regarding consistency between imaging and pathology results, 78.6% of women classified as BI-RADS 4-5based on the ABUS were diagnosed with precancerous lesions or cancer; which was7.2% higher than that of women based on HHUS. For BI-RADS 1-2, the false-negativerates of the ABUS and HHUS were almost identical and were much lower than thoseof MG.Conclusions: We observed a good diagnostic reliability for the ABUS. Considering its performance for breast cancer detection in women with high-density breastsand its lower operator dependence, the ABUS is a promising option for breastcancer detection in China.DOI: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.02.06 PMCID: PMC5953959PMID: 29861608
