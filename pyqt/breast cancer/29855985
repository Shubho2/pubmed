However, the optimal timing of pegfilgrastim administration has not been established. Objective We investigated the effect of the timing of pegfilgrastim administration on the prevention of FN in patients with breast cancer undergoing intermediate-risk chemotherapies.Method We retrospectively analysed the incidence of FN in patients with breastcancer treated at our institution with intermediate-risk chemotherapies andprimary or secondary prophylactic pegfilgrastim between 2015 and 2017. The impactof the timing of pegfilgrastim administration on the incidence of FN wasevaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. ResultsOverall, 87 patients received a total of 318 chemotherapy cycles withpegfilgrastim, and 14 patients (16%) experienced FN. In univariate analyses, day 2 pegfilgrastim administration, age of > 65 years, baseline haemoglobin< 12 g/dL, prior history of FN, and presence of recurrent/metastatic diseasetrended toward an association with FN. Adjustment for these confounding riskfactors revealed that day 2 pegfilgrastim administration was associated with asignificantly increased risk of FN (odds ratio 11.0, p = 0.009). ConclusionAdministrating pegfilgrastim on day 3 or later may prevent FN more effectivelyamong Japanese breast cancer patients receiving intermediate-risk chemotherapies.DOI: 10.1007/s11096-018-0667-z PMID: 29855985
