In this review we will extend the findingsthat chemokines participate actively in the neoplastic process, and consider the contribution of CCL5 activation of CCR5 on breast cancer cells to upregulation ofanabolic metabolic events that would support the energy demands of cellreplication and proliferation.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
