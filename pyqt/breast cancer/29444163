As a complete, high-energy diet itconsists of properly balanced nutrients, vitamins and minerals. The aim of thisstudy was to assess the effect of NutramilTM Complex on breast and prostatecarcinoma cells. Our results showed that NutramilTM Complex reduced the viabilityand proliferation of breast and prostate cancer cells and that this process wasassociated with the induction of apoptosis via activation of caspase signalling. Data showed elevated levels of p53 tumour suppressor, up-regulation of p38 MAPKand SAPK / JNK proteins and downregulation of anti-apoptotic ERK1/2, AKT1 andHSP27. Treatment with NutramilTM Complex also affected the expression of the BCL2family genes. Results also showed down-regulation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 andup-regulation of pro-apoptotic members such as BAX, BAD, BID. In addition, wealso observed regulation of many other genes, including Iκβα, Chk1 and Chk2,associated with apoptotic events. Taken together, our results suggest activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as most likely mechanism ofanti-carcinogenic activity of NutramilTM Complex.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0192860 PMCID: PMC5812662PMID: 29444163  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
