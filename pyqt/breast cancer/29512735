A consecutive series of43 female patients with large or locally advanced primary breast cancer,scheduled for surgery following neoadjuvant therapy, was retrospectivelyreviewed. Prior to surgery, all patients underwent MBI using a high‑resolutionsemiconductor‑based device for image acquisition. MBI data were correlated withsurgical histopathological findings. Spearman's correlation coefficient wascalculated to assess differences in residual tumor size with MBI andhistopathological examination. From the images obtained using MBI, 7 patientswere negative for residual tumors with pathological complete response(specificity, 100%) and positive in 34/36 patients with residual disease(sensitivity, 94.4%), including 26/27 patients with unifocal and 8/9 patientswith multicentric/multifocal tumors, 5 of which exhibited multiple microscopicfoci scattered in a fibrotic area. Overall accuracy was 95.3% and the positivepredictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 100 and 77.8%,respectively. MBI was false‑negative in one patient with a 2.5‑cm invasive ductalcarcinoma located close to the chest wall and in one patient with microscopicfoci of epithelial carcinoma. In the patients with unifocal residual tumors,correlation of tumor size between MBI and histopathology was r=0.981 (P<0.0001); however, MBI overestimated the number of lesions in one of these cases. In thepatients with multifocal/multicentric tumors, MBI adequately assessed residualtumor extent in 5/8 positive cases, overestimating the number of lesions in onecase and underestimating tumor extent in 2 further cases with microscopic fociscattered in a fibrotic area. MBI proved to be a highly accurate diagnostic tool in predicting complete tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy and residual tumorextent, correlating with surgical histopathological findings in 86% of overallcases. A positive result was always associated with the presence of residualdisease and MBI tumor size was strongly correlated with histopathologicalanalysis mainly in unifocal residual tumors.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6299 PMCID: PMC5928762PMID: 29512735
