Before delivering ELIOT, two catheters, each containing eight thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), werepositioned in the infraclavicular region. TLDs internal catheter was located deepin the tumor bed while the external catheter was placed on patient's skin.RESULTS: Data were available for 24/27 patients. The absorbed doses were referredto the dose of 21 Gy. Values measured by the external catheter were low, althoughstatistically significant higher doses were found close to the applicator (meanvalues 0.26-0.49 Gy). External TLD doses in proximity of the applicator werelower than those detected by their internal counterparts. Values measured by the internal catheter TLDs varied according to the distance from the applicator whileno correlation with tumor site and beam energy was found. The distance from theapplicator to deliver < 2 Gy to a CIED was 2 cm, while from 2.5 cm the dosemeasured in all the patients became negligible.CONCLUSIONS: This dosimetric study provided data to support the clinical use ofELIOT in BC patients having CIEDs as long as the suggested minimum safe distance of 2.5 cm is taken from the RT field in case of ELIOT single dose of 21 Gy, inthe energy range of 6-10 MeV.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4878-8 PMID: 29978418
