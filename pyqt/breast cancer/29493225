However, a compact microfluidic instrument enabling thoroughly automatedcell separation is still rarely reported until today due to the difficult hybrid between the macrosized fluidic control system and the microsized microfluidicdevice. In this work, we propose a novel and automated microfluidic instrument torealize size-based separation of cancer cells in a label-free and high-throughputmanner. Briefly, the instrument is equipped with a fully integrated microfluidic device and a set of robust fluid-driven and control units, and the instrumentfunctions of precise fluid infusion and high-throughput cell separation areguaranteed by a flow regulatory chip and two cell separation chips which are the key components of the microfluidic device. With optimized control programs, theinstrument is successfully applied to automatically sort human breastadenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 from 5 mL of diluted human blood with a highrecovery ratio of ∼85% within a rapid processing time of ∼23 min. We envisionthat our microfluidic instrument will be potentially useful in many biomedicalapplications, especially cell separation, enrichment, and concentration for thepurpose of cell culture and analysis.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00539 PMID: 29493225
