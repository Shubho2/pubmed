Interestingly, many metastaticcarcinomas express high levels of these channels. We hypothesized that if excess VGSCs are activated and Na+, K+-ATPase is simultaneously blocked, theintracellular Na+ concentration should increase, resulting in water movement intothe cell, causing swelling and lytic cell death. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cellsover-express VGSCs by 7-fold. To test our hypothesis, we treated these cells invitro with the Na+, K+-ATPase blocker, ouabain, and then stimulated with asublethal electric current. For in vivo histologic and survival studies,MDA-MB-231 xenografts were established in Nu/J mice. Mice injected with saline orouabain were electrically stimulated with trains of 10 msec 10V DC pulses. Withinseconds to minutes, the cells swelled and lysed. MCF-10a cells, which expressnormal VGSCs levels, were unaffected by this treatment. Cells from theweakly-malignant cell line, MCF-7, which express 3-fold greater VGSCs thanMCF-10a cells, displayed an intermediate time-to-lysis. The rate of lysiscorrelated directly with the degree of sodium channel expression and malignancy. We also demonstrated efficacy in cell lines from prostate, colon and lungcarcinomas. Treated MDA-MB-231 xenografts showed 60-80% cell death. In survivalstudies, TOL-treated mice showed significantly slower tumor growth vs. controls. These results are evidence that this "targeted osmotic lysis" represents a novel method for selectively killing cancer cells and warrants further investigation asa potential treatment for advanced and end-stage breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24581 PMCID: PMC5884651PMID: 29643996
