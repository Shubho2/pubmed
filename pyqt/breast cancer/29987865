We soughtto determine if there are differences in cancer survival between immigrants andthe host population in Norway. We performed a nationwide registry-based studycomprising of subjects diagnosed with cancer between 1990 and 2014, and followed until the end of 2016. Survival was estimated for 13 cancer sites withcause-specific survival. Adjustments were made for common confounders (age, sex, year of diagnosis, place of residence) and defined mediators (stage at diagnosis,comorbidity and socioeconomic factors). A total of 500 255 subjects wereavailable for analysis, of which 11 252 were Western and 8701 non-Westernimmigrants. We did not find differences in cancer survival between Westernimmigrants and Norwegians, while non-Western immigrants, with some exceptions,had similar or better survival. Better lung cancer survival in non-Westernimmigrants than Norwegians was notable (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval):0.78 (0.71-0.85)), and not explained by defined mediators. Immigrants fromEastern Europe and Balkan with melanoma (hazard ratio: 1.54 (1.12-2.12)) andprostate cancer (hazard ratio: 1.34 (1.08-1.67)), and possibly from sub-SaharanAfrica with breast cancer (hazard ratio: 1.41 (0.94-2.12)) had worse survivalthan Norwegians. The results suggest that immigrants in Norway have good cancersurvival relative to the host population. Poor survival in immigrants fromEastern Europe and Balkan with melanoma and prostate cancer, and sub-SaharanAfrica with breast cancer might be a concern. This article is protected bycopyright.
