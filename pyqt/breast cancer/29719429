Inconsistency in the use ofendocrine therapy (et) for dcis is evident worldwide. We sought to assess thevariation in et prescribing for patients with dcis across a population-basedradiotherapy (rt) program and to identify variables that predict its use.Methods: Data from a breast cancer database were obtained for women diagnosedwith dcis in British Columbia from 2009 to 2014. Associations between et use and patient characteristics were assessed by chi-square test and multilevelmultivariate logistic regression. The Kaplan-Meier method, with propensity score matching and Cox regression analysis, was used to assess the effects of et onoverall survival (os) and relapse-free survival (rfs).Results: For the 2336 dcis patients included in the study, et use was 13% in dcispatients overall, and 17% in patients with estrogen receptor-positive (er+)tumours treated with breast-conserving surgery and rt. Significant variation inet use by treatment centre was observed (range: 8%-23%; p < 0.001), andprescription of et by individual oncologists varied in the range 0%-40%. Aftercontrolling for confounding factors, age less than 50 years [odds ratio (or):1.72; p = 0.01], treatment centre, er+ status (or: 5.33; p < 0.001), and rt use(or: 1.77; p < 0.001) were significant predictors of et use. No difference in os or rfs with the use of et was observed.Conclusions: In this population-based analysis, 13% of patients with dcis inBritish Columbia received et, with variation by treatment centre (8%-23%) andindividual oncologist (0%-40%). Age less than 50 years, er+ status, and rt usewere most associated with et use.DOI: 10.3747/co.25.3795 PMCID: PMC5927784PMID: 29719429
