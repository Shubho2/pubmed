All patients had first-line chemotherapy with or withouttrastuzumab. They were classified into 3 groups according to their HER2 statusand trastuzumab treatment: HER2-positive mBC patients with or without trastuzumabtreatment and HER2-negative patents.RESULTS: Trastuzumab administration in HER2-positive mBC patients significantlyprolonged overall survival (33 vs. 26 months; P = 0.003) and led to a 49.8%reduction in death risk. In the subgroup analysis, HER2-positive patients withhormone receptor (HR)-negative status (29 vs. 17 months; P = 0.000) or visceralmetastasis (30 vs. 21 months; P = 0.000) had more survival benefit when treatedwith trastuzumab.CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab administration significantly improved the overallsurvival in HER2-positive mBC patients, who gained a prognosis comparable to thatof patients with HER2-negative disease. HR status and metastasis site might beimportant surrogate makers that predict survival benefit from trastuzumab-basedtreatment.Â© 2018 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg.DOI: 10.1159/000488202 PMID: 29902791
