Genomic sequencing has detected a distinctivemutational portrait of both the germline and somatic alterations in TNBC, whichis staggeringly different from other breast cancer subtypes. The clinical utilityof sequencing germline BRCA1/2 genes has been well established in TNBC. However, for other predisposition genes, studies concerning the risk and penetrance toTNBC are relatively scarce. Very few recurrent mutations, including TP53 andPI3KCA mutations, together with a long tail of individually rare mutations occur in TNBC. These combined effects of genomic alterations drive TNBC progression.Given the complexity and heterogeneity of TNBC, clinical interpretation of thegenomic alterations in TNBC may pave a new way for the treatment of TNBC. In thisreview, we summarized the germline and somatic mutation profiles of TNBC anddiscussed the current and upcoming therapeutic strategies targeting the mutantproteins or pathways to enable tailored-therapeutics.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0850-9 PMCID: PMC6046102PMID: 30007403
