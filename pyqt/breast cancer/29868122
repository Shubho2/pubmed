Due to its heterogeneous nature, breast cancer management mightbenefit from differential treatments toward personalized medicine. Additionally, drug resistance is a common phenomenon. We systematically investigated the effectof 14 different drugs administered on BC cell lines in combination with microRNAs(miRNA, miR). Methods: Thirty-eight miRNAs, all associated with BC by clinicaland molecular parameters including progression, prognosis and subtypes, weretested for their effects on the viability of 12 different BC cell lines. FourmiRNAs with the strongest impact on viability were further assayed in combinationwith 14 BC drugs. Mann-Whitney U-test with Bonferroni correction was used forstatistical analysis. Results: In a miRNA only pre-screen we observed effects on BC cell lines' viability for 34 out of 38 candidate miRNAs. We then identified 14miRNA/drug combinations for which the combination IC50 was lower than that ofboth miRNA and drug as single agents. miR-181a, paired with GSK1070916,Doxorubicin, XL765 and AMG511, was the only miRNA active on the triple negative(TNBC) MDA-MB-468 cell line. miR-126 was the only miRNA (in combination withCDK4/6 or PIK3CA inhibitors) with significant effects on cell lines fromdifferent subtypes: MCF7 (Luminal) and MDA-MB-453 (HER2+). Because of itsactivity on different BC subtypes, we investigated the genome wide effects ofmiR-126 using transcriptomics and confirmed that expression of miR-126 in BC celllines affected cell cycle and mitosis. Conclusion: Our results show that acombination treatment with miRNAs, in particular miR-181a, miR-326, miR-9 andmiR-126, enhance the activity of specific BC drugs in vitro, even on the mostaggressive BC subtypes, HER2+ and TNBC. Finally, as expected from its druginteractions, based on a whole transcriptome study we could confirm a role formiR-126 in cell cycle regulation.DOI: 10.3389/fgene.2018.00174 PMCID: PMC5968201PMID: 29868122
