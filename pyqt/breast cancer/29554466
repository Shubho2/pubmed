Employment of common inputspermits greater ability to compare model output than when each model begins with different input parameters. The use of common inputs also enhances inferencesabout the results, and provides a range of reasonable results based on variationsin model structure, assumptions, and methods of use of the input values. Thecommon input data are updated for each analysis to ensure that they reflect themost current practice and knowledge about breast cancer. The common core ofparameters includes population rates of births and deaths; age- andcohort-specific temporal rates of breast cancer incidence in the absence ofscreening and treatment; effects of risk factors on incidence trends;dissemination of plain film and digital mammography; screening test performancecharacteristics; stage or size distribution of screen-, interval-, andclinically- detected tumors by age; the joint distribution of ER/HER2 by age and stage; survival in the absence of screening and treatment by stage and molecular subtype; age-, stage-, and molecular subtype-specific therapy; dissemination and effectiveness of therapies over time; and competing non-breast cancer mortality.METHOD AND RESULTS: In this paper, we summarize the methods and results for thecommon input values presently used in the CISNET breast cancer models, noteassumptions made because of unobservable phenomena and/or unavailable data, andhighlight plans for the development of future parameters.CONCLUSION: These data are intended to enhance the transparency of the breastCISNET models.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X17700624 PMCID: PMC5862072 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29554466
