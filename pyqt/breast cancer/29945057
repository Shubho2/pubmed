BPE wascategorized according to BI-RADS. The association between BPE and breast cancermolecular subtype/prognostic factors was evaluated.RESULTS: No significant association was present between high BPE and thefollowing: HER2+ tumors, basal tumors, tumors with axillary nodal disease, highnuclear grade tumors, high Ki-67 index tumors or larger tumors.CONCLUSION: Patients with high BPE may be at increased risk for breast cancer butnot necessarily for those cancer subtypes with a poor prognosis.Copyright Â© 2018.
