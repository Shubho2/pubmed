Adoptinga pathophysiological perspective, this systematic review aims to synthesize theevidence examining the association between Hsp70/Hsp90 expression and breastcancer prognosis, as well as prognosis-related clinicopathological indices.Secondarily, changes in Hsp70/Hsp90 expression in the continuum of breastneoplasia were assessed.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hsp70/Hsp90 expression was approached globally, quantifiedby means of immunohistochemistry, western blot or PCR. This study was performedin accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Relevant studies were sought in PubMed,up to December 31, 2015.RESULTS: A total of 23 eligible studies were identified (7,288 breast cancercases). High Hsp90 expre s sion was associated with worse overall survival(pooled RR=1.48, 95%CI=1.21-1.82) and marginally with worse disease-freesurvival. High Hsp70 expression also correlated with worse disease-free survival (pooled RR=1.77, 95%CI=1.71-2.82). Hsp70 intense expression correlated with ERpositivity (pooled OR=3.51, 95%CI=1.31-9.40) and PR positivity (pooled OR=2.48,95%CI=1.39-4.44). No significant associations were noted between Hsp70/Hsp90expression and clinicopathological variables including histological grade, tumor size, nodal metastasis or patient age at diagnosis. No clear pattern emerged for Hsp70/Hsp90 expression along the breast neoplasia continuum.CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the prognosticrole of Hsp90 and Hsp70 expression in breast cancer. Further high-qualitystudies, with detailed reporting are needed to provide epidemiological evidencecomplementing the findings of ongoing clinical trials on Hsp inhibitors.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12384 PMID: 29491085  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
