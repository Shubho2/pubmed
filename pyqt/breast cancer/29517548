Denosumab offers analternative approach for the treatment of bone metastases. We describe a59-year-old woman with a history of breast carcinoma and bone metastasis who was prescribed denosumab for 4 years. The patient had no history of any priorbisphosphonate use. Bone scintigraphy showed an abnormal uptake in the rightfemur, which was confirmed as an impending AFF or atypical femoral stressreaction. In oncological patients receiving long-term denosumab, AFF should beincluded as a differential diagnosis for focal femoral findings.DOI: 10.1097/RLU.0000000000002058 PMID: 29517548
