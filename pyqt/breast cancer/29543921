Suchrelationships may give further insights into breast cancer pathology with respectto the status of estrogen receptor.METHODS: We used the quantitative real-time PCR technique to analyze differences in the expression levels of the ESR1 and GPX1 genes in paired malignant andnon-malignant tissues from breast cancer patients.RESULTS: ESR1 and GPX1 expression levels were found to be significantlydown-regulated by 14.7% and 7.4% (respectively) in the tumorous breast tissuewhen compared to the non-malignant one. Down-regulation of these genes wasindependent of the tumor histopathology classification and clinicopathologicalfactors, while the ESR1 mRNA level was reduced with increasing tumor grade (G1:103% vs. G2: 85.8% vs. G3: 84.5%; p<0.05). In the non-malignant and malignantbreast tissues, the expression levels of ESR1 and GPX1 were significantlycorrelated with each other (Rs=0.450 and Rs=0.360; respectively).CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that down-regulation of ESR1 and GPX1 wasindependent of clinicopathological factors. Down-regulation of ESR1 geneexpression was enhanced by the development of the disease. Moreover, GPX1 andESR1 gene expression was interdependent in the malignant breast tissue andfurther work is needed to determine the mechanism underlying this relationship.DOI: 10.18388/abp.2016_1425 PMID: 29543921
