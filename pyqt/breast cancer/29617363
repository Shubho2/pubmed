MCF-7 and MCF10A cells were pre-exposed to 50 Hz-EMFsfor 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 h and then treated with different concentrations of 5-FUfor 24 h; cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay and flow cytometry. Afterpre-exposure to 50 Hz-EMFs for 12 h, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution inMCF-7 and MCF10A cells were detected via flow cytometry and DNA synthesis wasmeasured by EdU incorporation assay. Apoptosis-related and cell cycle-relatedgene and protein expression levels were monitored by qPCR and western blotting.Pre-exposure to 50 Hz-EMFs for 12 h enhanced the antiproliferative effect of 5-FUin breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in a dose-dependent manner but not in normalhuman breast epithelial cell line MCF10A. Exposure to 50 Hz-EMFs had no effect onapoptosis and P53 expression of MCF-7 and MCF10A cells, whereas it promoted DNAsynthesis, induced entry of MCF-7 cells into the S phase of cell cycle, andupregulated the expression levels of cell cycle-related proteins Cyclin D1 andCyclin E. Considering the pharmacological mechanisms of 5-FU in specificallydisrupting DNA synthesis, this enhanced inhibitory effect might have resultedfrom the specific sensitivity of MCF7 cells in active S phase to 5-FU. Ourfindings demonstrate the enhanced cytotoxic activity of 5-FU on MCF7 cellsthrough promoting entry into the S phase of the cell cycle via exposure to 50Hz-EMFs, which provides a novel method of cancer treatment based on thecombinatorial use of 50 Hz-EMFs and chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0192888 PMCID: PMC5884488PMID: 29617363  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
