[Epub ahead of print]Diagnostic Value of Serum Concentration and Integrity of Circulating Cell-FreeDNA in Breast Cancer: A Comparative Study With CEA and CA15-3.Tang Z(1), Li L(1), Shen L(1), Shen X(1), Ju S(1), Cong H(1).Author information: (1)Center of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University,Nantong, China.Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common types of malignant neoplasm inwomen; the incidence of BC increases yearly. In a previous study, a novel andsensitive method for quantitying cell-free DNA (CFD) in human blood wasestablished and tested for its ability to predict which patients harbored tumors.Our objective in this study was to investigate the clinical value of serumconcentration and the integrity of circulating free DNA (CFD) as a biomarker for auxiliary diagnosis of BC. The concentration of CFD was quantitated by branchedDNA (bDNA)-based Alu assay. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen15-3 (CA 15-3) concentrations were determined via Abbott ARCHITECT I2000 SRtesting. We report that the median (quartile interval) values of serum ALU115 andALU247/115 in patients with BC were significantly higher than those in patientswith benign mammary hyperplasia and in healthy control individuals (1083.66 ng/mL[1.81] vs 145.87 ng/mL [0.33] and 228.19 ng/mL [0.48]; P <.001); there was nosignificant difference between the latter 2 groups (P> .05). The cutoff values ofALU115, ALU247/115, CEA, and CA15-3 were set as 300.96 ng per mL, 0.78, 5 ng per mL, and 31.3 ng per mL, respectively. The area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) curve was 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.81),0.97 (<.001->.99), 0.75 (0.65-0.86), and 0.89 (0.82-0.96), respectively. Combineddetection of the 4 indices significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy of BC, with sensitivity of 97.5% and negative predictive value of 96.4%. Also, serumALU115 was significantly correlated with lymph-node metastasis (P = .048), andthe ALU247/115 index was significantly correlated with tumor stage (P = .001) andlymph-node metastasis (P = .008) in patients with BC. Serum cell-free DNA (CFD)and its integrity may prove to be useful biomarkers for auxiliary diagnosis,grading of malignant neoplasms, and prognostic prediction of BC.DOI: 10.1093/labmed/lmy019 PMID: 29701836
