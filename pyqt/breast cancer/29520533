We compared acupuncture (AC) to usual care wait-list control (WL) for treatment of persistentBCRL.METHODS: Women with moderate BCRL lasting greater than six months were randomizedto AC or WL. AC included twice weekly manual acupuncture over six weeks. Weevaluated the difference in circumference and bioimpedance between affected andunaffected arms. Responders were defined as having a decrease in armcircumference difference greater than 30% from baseline. We used analysis ofcovariance for circumference and bioimpedance measurements and Fisher's exact to determine the proportion of responders.RESULTS: Among 82 patients, 73 (89%) were evaluable for the primary endpoint (36 in AC, 37 in WL). 79 (96%) patients received lymphedema treatment beforeenrolling in our study; 67 (82%) underwent ongoing treatment during the trial. Wefound no significant difference between groups for arm circumference difference(0.38 cm greater reduction in AC vs. WL, 95% CI - 0.12 to 0.89, p = 0.14) orbioimpedance difference (1.06 greater reduction in AC vs. WL, 95% CI - 5.72 to7.85, p = 0.8). There was also no difference in the proportion of responders: 17%AC versus 11% WL (6% difference, 95% CI - 10 to 22%, p = 0.5). No severe adverse events were reported.CONCLUSIONS: Our acupuncture protocol appeared to be safe and well tolerated.However, it did not significantly reduce BCRL in pretreated patients receivingconcurrent lymphedema treatment. This regimen does not improve upon conventional lymphedema treatment for breast cancer survivors with persistent BCRL.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4743-9 PMID: 29520533
