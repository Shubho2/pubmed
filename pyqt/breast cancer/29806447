Even though silicone isconsidered to be an inert material, there are side effects that have beenreported, such as silicone lymphadenopathy. In the case reported herein, asilicone lymphadenopathy of the internal mammary and the anterior mediastinallymph nodes were revealed after a thymectomy for autoimmune myasthenia gravis.Silicone lymphadenopathy should always be part of the differential diagnosis ofenlarged lymph nodes, in patients with previous cosmetic or oncoplastic surgerywith the use of silicone gel breast implants. Special attention should be paid incase of previous breast cancer in order to rule out metastasis.DOI: 10.4081/monaldi.2018.912 PMID: 29806447
