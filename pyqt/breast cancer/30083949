We examined trends in RT use over 10 years, and the impact ofsociodemographic factors on the receipt of standard-of-care RT, using theNational Cancer Database (NCDB).MATERIALS/METHODS: Women under age 70 with invasive breast cancer who underwentBCS from 2004 to 2014 were analyzed. Receipt of RT was evaluated in the wholecohort and by time period to identify temporal trends. Multiple logisticregression models were used to assess associations between factors such as race, insurance status, ethnicity, and receipt of RT.RESULTS: A total of 501,733 patients met eligibility criteria. The percentage of patients undergoing adjuvant RT increased from 86.7% in 2004 to 92.4% in 2012,and then decreased in 2013 and 2014 to 88.9%. On univariate analysis, patients ofwhite race were significantly more likely to receive RT compared with patients ofblack race (90.4% vs 86.9%, p < 0.0001), as were non-Hispanic women compared toHispanic patients (90.2% vs. 85.3%, p < 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, race, ethnicity, insurance status, education level, and age remained significantlyassociated with receipt of RT. On temporal analysis, gaps remained stable, withno significant improvements over time.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests a recent decline in guideline-concordantreceipt of RT in women under 70, and persistent disparities in the use of RTafter BCS by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors. These findings raiseconcern for a recent detrimental change in patterns of care delivery.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4881-0 PMID: 30083949
