However, there are concerns that IER could result in'rebound' overconsumption of energy on unrestricted days. We studiedself-reported food records from participants in two trials of IER versuscontinuous energy restriction (Study 1; 44 women on IER for 6 months and Study 2;72 women on two types of IER for 4 months). Energy intake was assessed onrestricted and unrestricted days immediately before and after restricted days andon other unrestricted days. We assessed consistency of days of the week chosen asrestricted days, and whether this was associated with greater weight loss.Reported energy intake was reduced on unrestricted days in Study 1 and 2 and was 19% lower compared with the allocated isoenergetic diet, and respectively 21% and29% lower than their baseline reported daily intakes. Energy intake appeared tobe similarly reduced the day immediately before and after restricted days and on other unrestricted days. Seventy percent of women in Study 1 and 79% in Study 2undertook consistent days of restriction each week (>50% of restricted days onthe same 2 days each week). When studies were combined percentage weight loss at 3 months was -5.8 (-6.7 to -4.7) % in the consistent group and -7.4 (-8.7 to-6.2) % in the non-consistent group (p = .09). Food records from patientsundertaking IER suggest a spontaneous reduction in energy intake below theirbaseline reported intakes and the prescribed isoenergetic diet during allunrestricted days including the days immediately before and after restricted dayswhich contributes to the weight loss success with these diets. Consistency ofrestricted days was not associated with weight loss success. These findings need to be confirmed in larger groups of patients ideally using objective measures of energy balance.DOI: 10.1002/fsn3.586 PMCID: PMC5980333PMID: 29876119
