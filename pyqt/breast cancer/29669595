Here, we report that in breast carcinoma cells, the insulin-like growth factor 2messenger RNA binding protein (IMP1) binds to lncRNA urethralcarcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) and suppresses the UCA1-induced invasive phenotype.METHODS: RT-qPCR and RNA sequence assays were used to investigate the expression of UCA1 and miRNAs in breast cancer cells in response to IMP1 expression. Therole of IMP1-UCA1 interaction in cell invasion was demonstrated by transwellanalysis through loss-of-function and gain-of-function effects. RNA pull-down andRNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) were performed to confirm themolecular interactions of IMP1-UCA1 and UCA1-miR-122-5p involved in breast cancercells.RESULTS: In breast cancer cells, IMP1 interacts with UCA1 via the "ACACCC" motifswithin UCA1 and destabilizes UCA1 through the recruitment of CCR4-NOT1deadenylase complex. Meanwhile, binding of IMP1 prevents the association ofmiR-122-5p with UCA1, thereby shifting the availability of miR-122-5p from UCA1to the target mRNAs and reducing the UCA1-mediated cell invasion. Accordingly,either IMP1 silencing or UCA1 overexpression resulted in reduced levels of freemiR-122-5p within the cytoplasm, affecting miR-122-5p in regulating its targetmRNAs.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides initial evidence that interaction between IMP1and UCA1 enhances UCA1 decay and competes for miR-122-5p binding, leading to the liberation of miR-122-5p activity and the reduction of cell invasiveness.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0959-1 PMCID: PMC5907460PMID: 29669595
