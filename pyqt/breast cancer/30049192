Email: amutha.ramadas@monash.eduBackground: There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of multifacetedgroup-based interventions to improve psychological well-being and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of breast cancer (BCa) survivors in Malaysia. This study is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of such intervention program among theBCa survivors. Materials and Methods: This was a group-based intervention programwith pre- and post-test design, carried out among BCa survivors (n=37) who weremembers of Breast Cancer Support Group Centre, Johor Bahru. A validatedself-administered questionnaire was used to assess the impact of the program onpsychosocial well-being and HRQOL of the participants. Results: The mean age ofBCa survivors was 58.1 years (SD=9.7), with mean age at diagnosis of 49.9 years(SD=9.6). Majority of them were of Chinese ethnicity, married and had secondarylevel education, but were unemployed. More than 86% of them were diagnosed tohave early BCa diagnosis and have since completed the treatment. There weresignificant decreases in median depression (p=0.001), anxiety (p<0.001) andstress (p<0.001) scores at post-intervention. More than 85% of the participantsrated themselves to have a good or very good QOL at post-intervention, as opposedto 75.9% at pre-intervention. Significant improvements in several HR-QOL domainscores were seen, with psychological score improving the most (p<0.001), followedby social relationship (p=0.002) and physical health (p=0.004). Conclusions:Group-based multifaceted intervention can be a viable solution to improvepsychosocial well-being of BCa survivors.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.7.1809 PMID: 30049192
