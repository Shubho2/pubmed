A high proportion of pregnancies among women ofolder reproductive age are unintended and these pregnancies can also beassociated with negative maternal and infant consequences. However, women andtheir healthcare providers may have concerns about risks associated withcontraceptive use, particularly combined hormonal contraceptives, among women of older reproductive age who already may be at increased risk for conditions suchas cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Nonetheless, available evidence doesnot suggest that hormonal contraceptive use among women of older reproductive agesubstantially increases age-related risks of cardiovascular events or breastcancer. CDC recommends that contraception is still needed for women older than 44years who have not reached menopause and wish to avoid pregnancy, and that based on age alone, all contraceptive methods are considered safe or generally safe foruse by women of older reproductive age.DOI: 10.1089/jwh.2018.6985 PMID: 29634450
