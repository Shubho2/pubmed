[Epub ahead of print]On the propensity score weighting analysis with survival outcome: Estimands,estimation, and inference.Mao H(1)(2), Li L(2), Yang W(3), Shen Y(2).Author information: (1)Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, School of Public Health, TheUniversity of Texas, Houston, TX, USA.(2)Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson CancerCenter, Houston, TX, USA.(3)Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University ofPennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.Propensity score analysis is widely used in observational studies to adjust forconfounding and estimate the causal effect of a treatment on the outcome. Whenthe outcome is survival time, there are special considerations on the definition of the causal estimand, point, and variance estimation that have not beenthoroughly studied in the literature. We investigate propensity score analysis ofsurvival data with a class of weighting methods. We consider the followingestimands in the two-sample context: average survival time, restricted averagesurvival time, survival probability, survival quantile, and the marginal hazardratio. We propose a unified analytic framework to obtain the point and varianceestimators. The proposed methodology properly adjusts for the samplingvariability in the estimated propensity scores. Extensive simulations show thatthe point and variance estimators possess desired finite sample properties anddemonstrate better numerical performance than some existing weighting andmatching methods commonly used in the literature. The proposed methodology isillustrated with data from a breast cancer study.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/sim.7839 PMID: 29855060
