A Retrospective Study of PatientTravel Burden in Cancer Clinical Trials.Borno HT(1), Zhang L(2)(3), Siegel A(2), Chang E(3), Ryan CJ(2)(3).Author information: (1)Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University ofCalifornia San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA hala.borno@ucsf.edu.(2)Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University ofCalifornia San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.(3)Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.BACKGROUND: Recent literature suggests that living in a rural setting may beassociated with adverse cancer outcomes. This study examines the burden of travelfrom home to cancer center for clinical trial (CT) enrollees.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients from the University of California San FranciscoClinical Trial Management System database who enrolled in a cancer CT for abreast, genitourinary, or gastrointestinal malignancy between 1993 and 2014 were included. Cancer type, household zip code, race/ethnicity, phase of study, study sponsor, and year of signed consent were exported. Distance traveled from home tocenter was calculated using a GoogleMaps application programming interface. Therelationships of distance with phase of CT, household income, and race/ethnicity were examined.RESULTS: A total of 1,600 patients were enrolled in breast (55.8%), genitourinary(29.4%), or gastrointestinal (14.9%) cancer CTs. The overall medianunidirectional distance traveled from home to study site was 25.8 miles(interquartile range [IQR] 11.5-75.3). Of the trial sponsors examined, principal investigator (56.4%), industry (22.2%), cooperative group (11.6%), and NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH; 9.8%), the longest distance traveled was forNIH-sponsored trials, with a median of 39.4 miles (p < .001). Phase I (8.4%)studies had the longest distance traveled, with a median of 41.2 miles (IQR14.5-101.0 miles; p = .001). White patients (83%) traveled longer compared withblack patients (4.4%), with median distances of 29.9 and 13.9 miles, respectively(p < .001). Patients from lower-income areas (n = 799) traveled longer distances compared with patients from higher-income areas (n = 773; 58.3 vs. 17.8 miles,respectively; p < .001). A multivariable linear model where log10 (distance) was the outcome and adjusting for the exported variables and income revealed thatcancer type, year of consent, race/ethnicity, and income were significantlyassociated with distance traveled.CONCLUSION: This study found that the burden of travel is highest among patients enrolled in NIH-sponsored trials, phase I studies, or living in low-income areas.These data suggest that travel burden for cancer CT participants may besignificant.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study is one of the first to measure traveldistance for patients in cancer clinical trials using a real-world GoogleMapscalculator. Out-of-pocket expenses such as travel are not typically covered byhealth care payers; therefore, patients may face considerable cost to attend eachstudy visit. Using a single-center clinical trials enrollment database, thisstudy found that the burden of travel is highest for patients enrolled inNational Institutes of Health-sponsored trials and phase I studies, as well asfor patients living in low-income areas. Results suggest that a significantproportion of patients enrolled in clinical trials face a substantial travelburden.© AlphaMed Press 2018.DOI: 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0628 PMID: 29700209
