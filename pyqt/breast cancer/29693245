[Epub ahead of print]Developing anti-HER2 vaccines: Breast cancer experience.Al-Awadhi A(1), Lee Murray J(2), Ibrahim NK(2).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson CancerCenter, Houston, TX.(2)Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD AndersonCancer Center, Houston, TX.Breast cancer accounts for more than one million new cases annually and is theleading cause of death in women globally. HER2 overexpression induces cellularand humoral immune responses against the HER2 protein and is associated withhigher tumor proliferation rates. Trastuzumab-based therapies are effectively andwidely used as standard of care in HER2-amplified/overexpressed breast cancerpatients; one cited mechanism of action is the induction of passive immunity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against malignant breast cancer cells.These findings drove the efforts to generate antigen-specific immunotherapy totrigger the patient's immune system to target HER2-overexpressing tumor cells,which led to the development of various vaccines against the HER2 antigen. Thisarticle discusses the various anti-HER2 vaccine formulations and strategies andtheir potential role in the metastatic and adjuvant settings.Â© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31551 PMID: 29693245
