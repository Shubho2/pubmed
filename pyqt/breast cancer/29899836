The ADC targeting activatedmatriptase of tumor cells was synthesized by using the potent anti-tubulin toxin,monomethyl auristatin-E linked to the activated matriptase-specific monoclonalantibody (M69) via a lysosomal protease-cleavable dipeptide linker. This ADC was found to be cytotoxic against multiple activated matriptase-positive epithelialcarcinoma cell lines in vitro and markedly inhibited growth of triple negativebreast cancer xenografts and a primary human TNBC (PDX) in vivo. Overexpressionof activated matriptase may be a biomarker for response to this ADC. The ADC had potent anti-tumor activity, while the unconjugated M69 antibody was ineffectivein a mouse model study using MDA-MB-231 xenografts in mice. Treatment of a human TNBC (MDA-MB-231) showed potent anti-tumor effects in combination with cisplatin in mice. This ADC alone or in combination with cisplatin has the potential toimprove the treatment outcomes of patients with TNBC as well as other tumorsoverexpressing activated matriptase.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25414 PMCID: PMC5995259PMID: 29899836
