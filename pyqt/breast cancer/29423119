ER-positive patients are commonly treated withadjuvant endocrine therapy, however, resistance is a common occurrence and aside from ER-status, no unequivocal predictive biomarkers are currently in clinicaluse. In this study, we aimed to identify constitutional genetic variantsinfluencing breast cancer survival among ER-positive patients and specifically,among endocrine-treated patients. We conducted a meta-analysis of threegenome-wide association studies comprising in total 3,136 patients withER-positive breast cancer of which 2,751 had received adjuvant endocrine therapy.We identified a novel locus (rs992531 at 8p21.2) associated with reduced survivalamong the patients with ER-positive breast cancer (P = 3.77 × 10-8). Anotherlocus (rs7701292 at 5q21.3) was associated with reduced survival among theendocrine-treated patients (P = 2.13 × 10-8). Interaction analysis indicated thatthe survival association of rs7701292 is treatment-specific and independent ofconventional prognostic markers. In silico functional studies suggest plausiblebiological mechanisms for the observed survival associations and a functionallink between the putative target genes of the rs992531 and rs7701292 (RHOBTB2 andRAB9P1, respectively). We further explored the genetic interaction betweenrs992531 and rs7701292 and found a significant, treatment-specific interactiveeffect on survival among ER-positive, endocrine-treated patients (hazard ratio = 6.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.79-27.08, Pinteraction= 0.036). This is thefirst study to identify a genetic interaction that specifically predictstreatment outcome. These findings may provide predictive biomarkers based on germline genotype informing more personalized treatment selection.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.22747 PMCID: PMC5790536PMID: 29423119
