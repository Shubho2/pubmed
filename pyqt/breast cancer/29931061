A "war on cancer" had beendeclared. Combination cytotoxic chemotherapy was predicted to cure all cancers,based on the stunning success in treating childhood leukemia. Breast cancertreatments were primitive; radical mastectomy and radiation were standard of carefor disease that had not spread. Ablative endocrine surgery (oophorectomy,hypophysectomy, and adrenalectomy) was a palliative last option for metastaticbreast cancer. However, only 30% responded, surviving for only 1 or 2 years:every patient soon died. The discovery of the estrogen receptor (ER) andtranslation to breast cancer treatment triggered a revolution in women's health. Two important but interconnected events occurred in 1972 at the WorcesterFoundation for Experimental Biology (WFEB) that would exploit the breast tumor ERas the first target to save lives and prevent breast cancer development. Two new groups of medicines-selective ER modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors(AIs)-would continue the momentum of research at the WFEB to improve women'shealth. Here, we recount the important progress made in women's health based onknowledge of the endocrinology of breast cancer. We propose future opportunities in SERM therapeutics to "refresh" the current standards of care for breast cancertreatment. The opportunity is based on emerging knowledge about acquiredresistance to long-term adjuvant AI therapy used to treat breast cancer.DOI: 10.1210/en.2018-00263 PMID: 29931061
