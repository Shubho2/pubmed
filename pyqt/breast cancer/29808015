Trials to date have largely focused on metastatic triple-negative disease, a genomicallyunstable subtype of breast cancer that is believed to be the most immunogenic andfollowing the development of treatment resistance, has limited treatment options and a particularly poor prognosis. Both checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy andcombinations with chemotherapy are being investigated. In this review, we discussthe current evidence for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in metastatic triple-negative breastcancer (TNBC), HER2+ breast cancer and ER+ disease, as well as the emergingevidence for use in the early-stage (neoadjuvant) setting. We also proposepotential ways of improving responses to checkpoint blockade in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0126-6 PMID: 29808015
