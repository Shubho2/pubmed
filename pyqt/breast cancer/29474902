In Ecuador (South America), use of fennel in traditional cancertreatment is on record.AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of the present study was to demonstrate theanti-proliferative and apoptotic effect of chloroform fraction of fennel (CFF) inMCF-7 cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-proliferative assay (MTT assay) and colony formation assay were performed to study the growth inhibitory effect of CFF. Variousmorphological changes of apoptosis were observed using Giemsa, Hoechst andAcridine orange/ ethidium bromide stains in MCF-7 cells. The extent of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest was measured by flow cytometer. Levels of ROS andmitochondrial membrane potential was measured by DCFH-DA and JC-1 respectively.Caspases activity was measured by luminescence and DNA fragmentation by cometassay.RESULTS: CFF appeared as a good inhibitor of growth against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-237 in time- and concentration-dependent manners. All the morphological changes ofapoptosis were evident in treatment groups. Annexin V/PI-assay of apoptosis gave around 49% of apoptotic cells upon treatment of 0.5 mg/ml of CFF and PI-stainedcells showed the G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Elevated levels of ROS, disruptedmitochondrial membrane, increased levels of caspase-9 & caspase-3 and DNAfragmentation were noted in treated MCF-7 cells.CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed the proliferation inhibition, cell cycle arrestand apoptosis induction effect of CFF, which may help in exploring the novelanti-cancer drug for therapeutic implications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
