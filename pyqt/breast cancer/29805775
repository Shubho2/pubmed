These factors are strongly related to oxidativestress (OS) through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The OS iscaused by an imbalance in the redox status of the organism and is literallydefined as "an imbalance between ROS generation and its detoxification bybiological system leading to impairment of damage repair by cell/tissue". Themultistep progression of cancer suggests that OS is involved in cancerinitiation, promotion and progression. In this review, we described the role ofOS and the interplay with environmental, host and viral factors related tobreast, cervical and ovarian cancers initiation, promotion and progression. Inaddition, the role of the natural antioxidant compound curcumin and othercompounds for breast, cervical and ovarian cancers prevention/treatment isdiscussed.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25323 PMCID: PMC5955122PMID: 29805775
