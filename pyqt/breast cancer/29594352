Its relatively rare occurrence in breast tumours has also been documented. The aim of the present study was to assess the rate of any membranous MIB-1staining in breast specimens. The staining was performed at room temperature with1:100 dilution of the antibody. One hundred four core needle biopsies and 41operative specimens were analysed. Membranous staining was noted in 36/144invasive carcinomas, 20/42 in situ carcinomas and 46/99 cases of peritumouralbenign/normal breast epithelium. Most often, it presented as focal and partialpolarised luminal membranous staining although complete circumferential staining also occurred, and membranous labelling was sometimes accompanied by cytoplasmic staining, too. In a few cases tested, greater dilution of the primary antibodydid not abolish the membranous staining, which was absent with the SP6 monoclonalKi-67 antibody. The membranous staining of invasive tumours showed no associationwith histological grade, lumen formation, oestrogen or progesterone receptorstatus or the Ki-67 nuclear labelling. In contrast, it was associated with aHER2-positive status, although it occurred in all molecular subtypes approachedby immunohistochemistry. The background of this membranous staining remainselusive. It is unlikely to represent an artefact. At least partial sharing of an epitope of the nuclear Ki-67 protein with an unidentified membranous protein and some functional differences between membranous staining producing tumours andtumours lacking this pattern of staining may both contribute to some extent.DOI: 10.1007/s00428-018-2343-z PMID: 29594352  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
