Inthis present era of cancer treatment, therapeutic options for patients withadvanced or recurrent ovarian cancer are limited. The present standard of caretreatment for advanced ovarian cancer is a platinum-based doublet chemotherapy(paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without bevacizumab) after a maximum attempt of surgical cytoreduction. However, there are no promising options for themanagement of patients with ovarian cancer refractory to the platinum-basedchemotherapy. Therefore, newer, safe, and more effective treatment modalities arerequired for patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer. Poly(adenosinediphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have shown an impressivesafety profile and anti-tumor efficacy in patients with breast cancer 1 and2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2) gene-mutated ovarian cancer who were previously treated with the standard of care chemotherapy. We have done a detailed review of theliterature to emphasize the role of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of advanced or relapsed ovarian cancer.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2685 PMCID: PMC6059530PMID: 30050740
