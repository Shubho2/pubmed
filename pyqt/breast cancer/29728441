Here, wereport that elevated expression of urine diphosphate-galactose ceramidegalactosyltransferase (UGT8) specifically occurs in BLBC and predicts poorprognosis in breast cancer patients. UGT8 expression is transcriptionallyup-regulated by Sox10, triggering the sulfatide biosynthetic pathway; increasedsulfatide activates integrin αVβ5-mediated signaling that contributes to BLBCprogression. UGT8 expression promotes, whereas UGT8 knockdown suppressestumorigenicity and metastasis. Importantly, we identify that zoledronic acid(ZA), a marketed drug for treating osteoporosis and bone metastasis, is a direct inhibitor of UGT8, which blocks the sulfatide biosynthetic pathway.Significantly, a clinically achievable dosage of ZA exhibits apparent inhibitory effect on migration, invasion, and lung metastasis of BLBC cells. Together, ourstudy suggests that UGT8 is a potential prognostic indicator and druggable targetof BLBC and that pharmacologic inhibition of UGT8 by ZA offers a promisingopportunity for treating this challenging disease.© 2018 Cao et al.DOI: 10.1084/jem.20172048 PMCID: PMC5987921 [Available on 2018-12-04]PMID: 29728441
