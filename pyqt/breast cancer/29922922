[Epub ahead of print]Metabolic relevance for N-hydroxy L-arginine reduction in estrogen-negativebreast cancer cells.Mohan S(1), Patel S(2), Greenstein I(2), Ng C(2), Frazier K(2), Nguyen G(2),Harding L(2), Barlow D(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of New England, Portland, ME, 04103, USA. smohan@une.edu.(2)Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of New England, Portland, ME, 04103, USA.We had shown Nw-hydroxy-L-arginine (NOHA) as a promising blood-based biomarkerfor estrogen-receptor-negative (ER - ) breast cancer (BC) that differentiates ER - BC based on grade and molecular phenotype. In this in vitro study, we assessed the metabolic relevance for ER- BC-specific NOHA modulation and correlated themwith NOHA regulatory responses. This study aids future NOHA clinical utility inER- BC diagnosis and therapy management and would prove useful for potential drugdiscovery and development process.DOI: 10.1007/s00726-018-2603-x PMID: 29922922
