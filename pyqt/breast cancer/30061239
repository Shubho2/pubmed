The optimal NLRcutoff, identified by ROC analysis, was set at 2.RESULTS: Elevated pre-treatment NLR was associated with worse disease-freesurvival (DFS) (HR=2.28) and overall survival (OS) (HR=3.39). The prognosticvalue of NLR was mostly evident in stage I BC (HR for DFS=2.89; HR for OS=1.30), in whom NLR significantly stratified patients who developed distant metastasis(HR= 4.62), but not local recurrence.CONCLUSION: NLR might provide important information in risk stratification,especially in stage I BC patients in whom the presence of a high NLR might raise the question as to whether they should be more aggressively managed.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12777 PMID: 30061239  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
