Logistic regression models were used tocalculate the odds ratios (ORs) for not being allocated to guideline treatment.Cox regression models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for overall andbreast cancer-specific deaths among women allocated or not allocated to guidelinetreatment.RESULTS: We identified 56,152 women with early-stage breast cancer diagnosed in1995-2011, of whom 499 women also had been diagnosed with schizophrenia orrelated disorders. The likelihood of women with schizophrenia or relateddisorders for not being allocated to guideline treatment was increased (adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-1.94). The adjusted HR for all-causemortality was 1.55; 95% CI, 1.32-1.82 and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.98-1.50) for breastcancer-specific mortality; women allocated to guideline treatment had an adjustedHR for breast cancer-specific death of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.11-1.82). The adjusted HR for death due to unnatural causes was 3.67 (95% CI, 1.80-7.35).CONCLUSION: The survival of women with schizophrenia or related disorders afterbreast cancer is significantly worse than that of women without these disorders. These patients are less likely to be allocated to guideline treatment, and, amongthose who are, mortality from both breast cancer and other causes is increased.Copyright Â© 2018.
