The size and THC of breastlesions were measured by conventional ultrasound (US) and US-guided DiffuseOptical Tomography (DOT) 1-2 days before surgery. Clinical and pathologyinformation of patients was collected.RESULT: The average THC values of ER- or PR- lesions were significantly higherthan the positive ones (P = .005 and P = .01,respectively); The average THCvalues of axillar LN+ or LVI+ were higher than the negative ones (P = .042 andP = .043, respectively). No significant THC difference was found in groups ofinfiltrating vs. non-infiltrating, HER2+ vs. HER2-, Ki67 high vs. Ki67 low, anddifferent menstrual phases (P = .457, P = .917, P = .417, P = .213,respectively).The incidence ages and the lesion-nipple distances of T3 patientswere lower than that of T1 and T2 (P < .001 and P < .001 respectively). The THCvalues and Ki67 indexes of T2 and T3 lesions were similar, but were higher thanthat of the T1 group (P < =0.001 and P = .006, respectively).CONCLUSION: Clinicopathological features of breast cancer, such as ER and PRstatus, axillary lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, correlate withTHC values. Furthermore, the Ki67 indexes can be predicted using tumor size andTHC, useful for pre-surgical evaluation of cancer biology and real-time,non-invasive monitoring of NAC efficacy.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
