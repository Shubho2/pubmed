For the clinical application of PTX, itneeds to be dissolved in an oil/detergent-based solvent due to its poorsolubility in an aqueous medium. However, the formulation often causesundesirable complications including hypersensitivity reactions and limited tumor distribution, resulting in a lower dose-dependent antitumor effect. Herein, weintroduce a facile and oil-free method to prepare albumin-based PTX nanoparticlesfor efficient systemic cancer therapy using a conjugate of human serum albumin(HSA) and poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG). PTX were efficiently incorporated in theself-assembled HSA-PEG nanoparticles (HSA-PEG/PTX) using a simple film castingand re-hydration procedure without additional processes such as application ofhigh pressure/shear or chemical crosslinking. The spherical HSA-PEG nanoparticle with a hydrodynamic diameter of ca. 280 nm mediates efficient cellular delivery, leading to comparable or even higher cytotoxicity in various breast cancer cells than that of the commercially available Abraxane®. When systemically administeredin a mouse xenograft model for human breast cancer, the HSA-PEG-basednanoparticle formulation exhibited an extended systemic circulation for more than96 h and enhanced intratumoral accumulation, resulting in a remarkable anticancereffect and prolonged survival of the animals.DOI: 10.1080/10717544.2018.1489430 PMID: 30044159
