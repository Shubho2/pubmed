We areaimed to elucidate the prognostic significance of micropapillary structures inbreast PMC.METHODS AND RESULTS: 75 patients with breast PMC were collected. All H&E stained slides were reviewed, clinicopathological features including age, tumor size,growth pattern, nuclear grade, histologic grade, lymph node (LN) status,immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of hormone receptor, human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, and Ki-67 proliferation index were analysed.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to verify the amplification ofHER2 gene in IHC 2+ cases. 71 cases of PMC were followed up from 18 to 110 months(median: 68 months).All PMC patients were females aged 31-83 years (median: 57years). All PMCs were nuclear grade 1 or grade 2. Oestrogen receptor was positivein all cases (100%), progesterone receptor was positive in 68 cases (90.7%).There's no 3+ staining or gene amplification of HER2. Four patients had axillary LN metastasis (5.7%). Micropapillae were observed in 60 cases (80%) with variedpercentages and divided in 5 groups, 0%, <20%, 20-49%, 50-89% and â‰¥90%, with 15(20%), 15 (20%), 17 (22.7%), 17 (22.7%) and 11 (14.7%) cases in each. Follow-upresults showed that neither recurrence nor distant metastasis occurred in allPMCs. Statistical analysis revealed that only larger tumor size was significantlycorrelated with LN metastasis (P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The presence of nuclear grade 1 or 2 micropapillae, despite thepercentage, had no significant relationship with LN metastasis and patients'survival of PMC.
