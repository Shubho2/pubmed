[Epubahead of print]An Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Histogram Method Versus a Traditional2-Dimensional Measurement Method for Identifying Non-Puerperal Mastitis FromBreast Cancer at 3.0 T.Tang Q(1), Li Q(1), Xie D(1), Chu K(2), Liu L(1), Liao C(3), Qin Y(1), Wang Z(1),Su D(1).Author information: (1)From the Department of Radiology, Oncology Hospital, Guangxi MedicalUniversity, Nanning.(2)Department of Radiology, Jingmen No. 2 Hospital, Jingmen.(3)Department of Lymph Blood Oncology, Oncology Hospital, Guangxi MedicalUniversity, Nanning, People's Republic of China.PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the utility of a volumetric apparentdiffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram method for distinguishing non-puerperalmastitis (NPM) from breast cancer (BC) and to compare this method with atraditional 2-dimensional measurement method.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pretreatment diffusion-weighted imaging data at 3.0 T wereobtained for 80 patients (NPM, n = 27; BC, n = 53) and were retrospectivelyassessed. Two readers measured ADC values according to 2 distinctregion-of-interest (ROI) protocols. The first protocol included the generation ofADC histograms for each lesion, and various parameters were examined. In thesecond protocol, 3 freehand (TF) ROIs for local lesions were generated to obtain a mean ADC value (defined as ADC-ROITF). All of the ADC values were compared byan independent-samples t test or the Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operatingcharacteristic curves and a leave-one-out cross-validation method were also used to determine diagnostic deficiencies of the significant parameters.RESULTS: The ADC values for NPM were characterized by significantly higher mean, 5th to 95th percentiles, and maximum and mode ADCs compared with thecorresponding ADCs for BC (all P < 0.05). However, the minimum, skewness, andkurtosis ADC values, as well as ADC-ROITF, did not significantly differ betweenthe NPM and BC cases.CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the generation of volumetric ADC histograms seems to be asuperior method to the traditional 2-dimensional method that was examined, and italso seems to represent a promising image analysis method for distinguishing NPM from BC.DOI: 10.1097/RCT.0000000000000758 PMID: 29787501
