While RMS is rare in adults, the breast and the bone marrow areknown but uncommon sites for metastatic disease. Bone marrow is also a knownsanctuary site for metastatic breast cancer. We present the case of a woman with a remote history of breast cancer and RMS who developed anemia andthrombocytopenia of unknown etiology. Additional laboratory tests were negativefor a cause; therefore, the decision was made to proceed with a bone marrowbiopsy. The initial biopsy results were consistent with breast cancer metastasis.Subsequent diagnostic imaging of the breast led to biopsy of an enlargingmorphologically benign breast mass, unexpectedly yielding alveolar RMS. Thisunanticipated diagnosis led to revaluation of the bone marrow, this time showing synchronous metastases from breast carcinoma and alveolar RMS. Imaging findingsof this patient, along with literature review of RMS imaging characteristics,will be reviewed.DOI: 10.1016/j.radcr.2018.03.003 PMCID: PMC6055091PMID: 30042812
