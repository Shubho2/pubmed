Although clinical literature onresponse of cutaneous metastases to chemotherapy is scarce, good response toeribulin has been reported. Herein, the clinical courses of three women with skinlesions secondary to metastatic breast cancer are described. The first patientachieved a complete clinical response in skin metastases with good tolerabilityto fourth-line eribulin (progression-free survival [PFS]: 8.5 months). In thesecond case, eribulin administered as fifth-line chemotherapy produced anobjective response and PFS of 6 months with good tolerability. The third patient also received eribulin in the fifth line and had a visible skin response from thefirst administration (PFS: 5 months).DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-0360 PMID: 29611759
