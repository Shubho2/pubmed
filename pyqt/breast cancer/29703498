CAC and TAC wereautomatically scored using deep learning algorithm. CVD risk categories werebased on Agatson CAC: 0, 1-10, 11-100, 101-400 and >400. Reliability betweenautomatic and manual scoring was assessed in 120 randomly selected CT scans from each population, with linearly weighted kappa for CAC categories and intraclasscorrelation coefficient for TAC.RESULTS: Median age was higher in Dutch patients than Singaporean patients: 57versus 52 years. CAC and TAC increased with age and were more present in Dutchpatients than Singaporean patients: 24.2% versus 17.3% and 73.0% versus 62.2%,respectively. Reliability of CAC categories and TAC was excellent in theNetherlands (0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.77-0.93) and 0.98 (95%CI = 0.96-0.98) respectively) and Singapore (0.90 (95% CI = 0.84-0.96) and 0.99(95% CI = 0.98-0.99) respectively).CONCLUSIONS: CAC and TAC prevalence was considerable and increased with age. Deeplearning software is a reliable method to automatically measure CAC and TAC onradiotherapy breast CT scans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
