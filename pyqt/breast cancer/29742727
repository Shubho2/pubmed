Only MRIreports containing, "oval shape, circumscribed margin, and fast initialenhancement," were extracted and analyzed. Follow-up results and clinical andpathological findings were evaluated.A total of 430 oval circumscribed lesionswith fast initial enhancement were included. Forty-eight lesions werepathologically confirmed at initial workup and 382 were followed up. Among the 48lesions, 14 were found to have additional malignancy and 34 were benign. Amongthe 382 followed-up lesions, only 1 was subsequently confirmed to be malignant.There were no evident changes in any of the remaining lesions during follow-up.The overall rate of malignancy was 3.5% (15/430). When lesions exhibited delayed washout enhancing kinetics (P < .001), were located ipsilaterally (P = .007), andcloser to the primary tumor (P = .012), the possibility of malignancy was high.High T2-weighted imaging signal intensity suggested benignity (P = .043).Althoughthe probability of being diagnosed with malignancy during follow-up in this studywas low (0.3%), this investigation revealed several preoperative MRIcharacteristics that should alert clinicians to the possibility of malignancy.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010704 PMCID: PMC5959388PMID: 29742727  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
