Low levels ofmiR-577 are found in several cancers, for example, thyroid carcinoma,glioblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study was toinvestigate the effect of miR-577 on breast cancer (BC).METHODS: The relative level of miR-577 in 120 BC tissues and cells was detectedby real-time PCR. MDA-MB-231 cells with upregulated miR-577 and MCF-7 cells with downregulated miR-577 were established. Transwell invasion assays were used toexamine the invasiveness of cells. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)markers were evaluated by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Targetedcombinations of miR-577 and Rab25 were analyzed by luciferase assays. Xenograftmodels were used to examine the effect of miR-577 on BC metastasis.RESULTS: MiR-577 expression was significantly suppressed in BC tissues. Tumorsize, tumor stage, and lymphatic metastasis were attributed to miR-577expression. Moreover, miR-577 overexpression strongly inhibited the invasiveness and EMT of BC cells in vitro. MiR-577 directly regulated Rab25 in BC. Rab25upregulation by miR-577 decreased the levels of E-cadherin and increased thelevels of Vimentin. Notably, Rab25 knockdown inhibited BC invasion; however, anincrease in Rab25 counteracted the invasive effect of miR-577 in BC.CONCLUSION: Results indicated that miR-577 suppressed EMT by inhibiting Rab25expression in BC. MiR-577 and Rab25 are considered potential targets of BCtreatment.Â© 2018 The Authors.
