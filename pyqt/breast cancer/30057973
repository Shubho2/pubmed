In preclinical models,beta-adrenergic signaling from fight-or-flight stress responses can stimulateprometastatic processes in the tumor microenvironment including upregulation ofM2 macrophages, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and lymphovascularinvasion. This study examines whether the same pathways are upregulated in breasttumors from socially isolated cancer patients.Methods: EMT and M1/M2 macrophage gene expression programs were analyzed bygenome-wide transcriptional profiling, and lymphatic and vascular density wereassessed by immunohistochemistry in primary tumors from 56 early-stage breastcancer patients who were part of the UCLA RISE study. Social isolation wasquantified by the Social Provisions Scale, and disease characteristics wereassessed by medical record review. General linear models were used to quantifydifferential gene expression across risk factor groups. Linear regression models were used to examine associations between social isolation and lymphovascularinvasion.Results: Tumors from socially isolated patients showed upregulated expression of genes involved in EMT (average score difference = +0.080 log2 mRNA abundance ±0.034 standard error) and M2 macrophage polarization (+0.033 ± 0.014) as well as increased density of lymphatic vessels (β= -.29) but no difference in bloodvessel density. TELiS promoter-based bioinformatics analyses indicated activationof CREB family transcription factors that mediate the gene-regulatory effects of β-adrenergic signaling (log2 fold-difference in promoter binding site prevalence:mean ± standard error = +0.49 ± 0.19).Conclusions: Primary breast tumors from socially isolated patients show multiple prometastatic molecular alterations, providing a plausible biological pathwaythrough which poor social support may accelerate breast cancer progression anddefining new targets for intervention.DOI: 10.1093/jncics/pky029 PMCID: PMC6054021PMID: 30057973
