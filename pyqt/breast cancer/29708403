In thisstudy, we evaluated the patients who were presented with multiple brainmetastasis and unknown primary tumor.MATERIALS & METHODS: 31 patients (17 males, 14 females; mean: 56.1 ± 14.22 years old) with diagnosis of brain metastasis according to histopathology and/or MRIwere included into this retrospective study.RESULTS: The patients presented with hypermetabolic (n = 17; mean SUVmax:11.6 ± 6.9) or hypometabolic brain lesions with additional different metastaticsites in 13 patients (mean SUVmax: 9.03 ± 4.02). The primary tumor was determinedby FDG PET/CT in 20/26 patients (77%) (lung [n = 6], primary brain [n = 9], renalcell carcinoma [n = 2], skin [n = 1], breast [n = 1] and neuroendocrine tumor[n = 1]).CONCLUSION: New generation multislice scanners may provide higher detectionratios. The detection rate of FDG PET/CT might be higher than previously reportedaccording to this study.DOI: 10.2217/cns-2017-0018 PMCID: PMC5977273PMID: 29708403
