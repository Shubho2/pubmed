The study is conducted prospectively in one year (March 2016-March 2017) in all 81 provinces of Turkey. Mammography images weretransferred via on-line web based system to the central reporting center. BI-RADSScores and KETEM models (Mobile vs. Stationary) were the parameters werecompared. In total mammography images of 414.802 patients were transferred from155 KETEMs to the central reporting center. From these patients; 95.872 (23,1%)were aged between 40 and 44. Among all images, 21.999 (5,3%) were BI-RADS 0-4-5, 391.123 (94,3%) were BI-RADS 1-2. Totally recall rate of the national reportingcenter was 5.3%. Number of patients screened per day were significantly higher inout-sourcing mobile trucks compared to stationary KETEMs (31.8 vs. 8.9;p < 0.05). This is the first and the largest breast cancer screening study which results of a population based mammography screening for 40-69 years old women areevaluated at the same time with the evaluation of the efficacy of newlyimplemented centralized reporting center and the mobile screening trucks incomparison with stationary cancer screening centers. According to the initialresults; Turkey's newly implemented population based breast cancer screeningsystem seems to be feasible and effective.DOI: 10.1016/j.pmedr.2018.04.008 PMCID: PMC5984250PMID: 29868386
