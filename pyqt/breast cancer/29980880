Data were drawn from the Population Study of Chinese Elderlyincluding 3159 Chinese American older adults aged 60 and above in the greaterChicago area. Cancer screening utilization was assessed by asking whetherparticipants had undergone colon, breast, cervical, or prostate cancer screening.Neighborhood cohesion was measured through six questions. Logistic regressionanalysis showed that greater neighborhood cohesion was associated with higherlikelihood of utilizing a mammogram (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.14-1.52), a Pap test (OR1.22, 95% CI 1.06-1.41), but not of a blood stool test (OR 1.10, 95% CI0.98-1.23), a colonoscopy (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94-1.17), and a PSA test (OR 1.13,95% CI 0.95-1.34). This study suggests positive associations between neighborhoodcohesion and breast and cervical cancer screening utilization among a ChineseAmerican older population.DOI: 10.1007/s10903-018-0783-9 PMID: 29980880
