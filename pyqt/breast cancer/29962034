This study aimed to determine the therapeutic effect of simvastatin in12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast cancer. Female albino micewere divided into two groups, with or without DMBA administration. After tumorappearance, DMBA-treated group was further divided into four groups (D1-D4) ascontrol (D1), treated with simvastatin at 80 and 40 mg/kg/day, orally (D2 and D3)and tamoxifen (50 mg/kg/day, orally) treated group (D4). After 4 weeks, animalswere sacrificed, serum samples were collected and tumors were dissected forhistopathological study and determination of selected parameters. The tumormarker carcinoma antigen 15-3 (CA15-3), oxidative stress parameters andprostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels were analyzed in serum and tumors in experimental groups. Tamoxifen and high dose of simvastatin improved parameters of mammarycarcinogenesis including mean tumor volume, body weight and percent of mortality as compared to mice with breast tumors without treatment (D1). Additionally,simvastatin usage increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC) level, paraoxonase 1(PON1) activity in serum and decreased total oxidant status (TOS) andmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in tumors similar to tamoxifen. No significantdecrease was found in serum CA 15-3 and tumor PGE2 levels in simvastatin andtamoxifen treated groups as compared to D1 group. These data suggest thatsimvastatin has anticancer effects which are relatively similar to that oftamoxifen in an animal model of breast cancer.© 2018 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique.DOI: 10.1111/fcp.12397 PMID: 29962034
