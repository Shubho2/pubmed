BMI values at baseline and after NAC were recorded, and the corresponding BMI category was assessed with the WHO classification. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were estimated using theKaplan-Meier method, and multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimatethe effect of covariates of interest on OS and RFS.RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 3.95 years. A change in BMI categoryfrom normal to obese during NAC was independently associated with shorter OSduration than was maintaining a normal weight [hazard ratio (HR) 1.637; 95%CI1.066-2.514; p = 0.0242]. Kaplan-Meier curves among breast cancer subtypes showeddifferences, and a decrease in BMI led to better RFS and OS rates in obesepatients with HR+/HER2- disease; those who maintained BMI also showed betterprognosis for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We saw no association betweenBMI change and pCR rate.CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that inability to maintain normal weight during NAC is a predictive marker of poor survival but not pCR. It may be important forpatients to maintain a normal weight during NAC.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4853-4 PMID: 29915946
