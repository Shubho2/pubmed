To explore the association of obesity with these conditions, weinvestigated peripheral blood leucocyte (PBL) DNA methylation markers foradiposity and their contribution to risk of incident breast and colorectal cancerand myocardial infarction.METHODS: DNA methylation profiles (Illumina Infinium® HumanMethylation450BeadChip) from 1941 individuals from four population-based European cohorts were analysed in relation to body mass index, waist circumference, waist-hip andwaist-height ratio within a meta-analytical framework. In a subset of theseindividuals, data on genome-wide gene expression level, biomarkers of glucose andlipid metabolism were also available. Validation of methylation markersassociated with all adiposity measures was performed in 358 individuals. Finally,we investigated the association of obesity-related methylation marks with breast,colorectal cancer and myocardial infarction within relevant subsets of thediscovery population.RESULTS: We identified 40 CpG loci with methylation levels associated with atleast one adiposity measure. Of these, one CpG locus (cg06500161) in ABCG1 wasassociated with all four adiposity measures (P = 9.07×10-8 to 3.27×10-18) andlower transcriptional activity of the full-length isoform of ABCG1(P = 6.00×10-7), higher triglyceride levels (P = 5.37×10-9) and highertriglycerides-to-HDL cholesterol ratio (P = 1.03×10-10). Of the 40 informativeand obesity-related CpG loci, two (in IL2RB and FGF18) were significantlyassociated with colorectal cancer (inversely, P < 1.6×10-3) and one intergeniclocus on chromosome 1 was inversely associated with myocardial infarction(P < 1.25×10-3), independently of obesity and established risk factors.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that epigenetic changes, in particular alteredDNA methylation patterns, may be an intermediate biomarker at the intersection ofobesity and obesity-related diseases, and could offer clues as to underlyingbiological mechanisms.DOI: 10.1038/s41366-018-0064-7 PMID: 29713043
