The aim of the present studywas to identify the miRNAs associated with liver metastasis in the cancer stroma of human colorectal cancer (CRC). Using laser capture microdissection, cancerstroma was obtained from the primary lesion of six patients with CRC with livermetastasis (CRCwLM) and six patients with CRC without liver metastasis (CRCwoLM),and miRNA microarray analysis was performed. Candidate miRNA expression status inthe stroma was validated by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chainreaction (RT‑qPCR) analysis in 40 CRC cases (wLM, n=20; woLM, n=20), and theassociation between miRNA expression and clinicopathological factors was assessedin 101 advanced CRC samples. The localization of candidate miRNAs in CRCs wasanalyzed using in situ hybridization analysis (ISH). The microarray analysisidentified six miRNAs with expression differing between the CRCwLM and CRCwoLMcancer stroma. Validation using RT‑qPCR analysis of the stroma showed that theexpression levels of miR‑221 and miR‑222 in the cancer stroma were significantly higher in CRCwLM than in CRCwoLM. The RT‑qPCR analysis of 101 CRC samples showed that a high expression level of miR‑221 or miR‑222 in the cancer stroma wasassociated with liver metastasis, distant metastasis, and shorter overallsurvival rate of patients with CRC (P<0.05). Increased levels of miR‑221 andmiR‑222 were observed in cancer cells and in fibroblasts in the stromal tissue inthe ISH analysis. The results suggested that the overexpression of miR‑221 andmiR‑222 in the cancer stroma is associated with the metastatic activity andmalignant potential in patients with CRC.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6575 PMID: 30015977
