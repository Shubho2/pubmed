Thus, novel early markers are required. Ion channels havegained great interest as tumor markers, including cervical cancer. Thecalcium-activated potassium channel KCNMA1 (subunit α-1 from subfamily M) hasbeen associated with different malignancies, including tumors such as breast and ovarian cancer that are influenced by hormones. The KCNMA1 channel blockeriberiotoxin decreases the proliferation of HeLa cervical cancer cells.Nevertheless, KCNMA1 channel expression during cervical carcinogenesis remainselusive. Therefore, KCNMA1 expression was studied in cervical cancer development.FVB transgenic mice expressing the E7-oncogene of high-risk human papillomavirus, and non-transgenic mice were treated with estradiol-releasing pelletsduring 3 or 6 months to induce cervical lesions. Twenty-four human cervicalbiopsies from non-cancerous, low- or high-grade intraepithelial lesions, orcervical cancer were also studied. mRNA and protein expression was assessed byreverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction andimmunohistochemistry, respectively. Cervical dysplasia and carcinoma wereobserved only in the transgenic mice treated with estradiol for 3 and 6 months,respectively. Estradiol treatment increased KCNMA1 mRNA and protein expression inall groups; however, the highest levels were observed in the transgenic mice withcarcinoma. KCNMA1 protein expression in the squamous cells of the transformation zone was observed only in the transgenic mice with cervical dysplasia or cancer. Human biopsies from non-cancerous cervix did not display KCNMA1 proteinexpression; in contrast, the majority of the tissues with cervical lesions(16/18) displayed KCNMA1 protein expression. The lowest channel immunostainingintensity was observed in biopsies from low-grade dysplasia and the strongest in the carcinoma tissues. These results suggest KCNMA1 channels as potential earlycervical cancer markers.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8187 PMCID: PMC5920501PMID: 29725443
