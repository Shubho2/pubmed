[Epubahead of print]Valproate augments Niraparib killing of tumor cells.Booth L(1), Roberts JL(1), Rais R(1), Poklepovic A(2), Dent P(1).Author information: (1)a Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , Virginia CommonwealthUniversity , Richmond , VA , USA.(2)b Medicine , Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.PARP1 inhibitors are approved therapeutic agents in ovarian carcinomas, and have clinical activity in some breast cancers. As a single agent, niraparib killedovarian and mammary tumor cells via an ATM-AMPK-ULK1 pathway which resulted inmTOR inactivation and the formation of autophagosomes, temporally followed byautolysosome formation. In parallel, niraparib activated a CD95-FADD-caspase 8pathway, and collectively these signals caused tumor cell death that wassuppressed by knock down of Beclin1, ATG5, CD95, FADD or AIF; or by expression ofc-FLIP-s, BCL-XL or dominant negative caspase 9. The HDAC inhibitors AR42 andsodium valproate enhanced niraparib lethality in a greater than additive fashion.HDAC inhibitors enhanced niraparib lethality by increasing activation of theATM-AMPK-ULK1-autophagy and CD95-FADD-caspase 8 pathways. Knock down of eIF2α,ATM, AMPKα, ULK1, Beclin1 or ATG5 reduced tumor cell killing by the niraparibplus HDAC inhibitor combination. Blockade of either caspase 9 function or that ofcathepsin B partially prevented cell death. As a single agent niraparib delayedtumor growth, but did not significantly alter the tumor control rate. Tumorspreviously exposed to niraparib had activated the ERK1/2 and AKT-mTOR pathwaysthat correlated with increased plasma levels of IL-8, MIF, EGF, uPA and IL-12.Collectively our findings argue that the addition of HDAC inhibitors to niraparibenhances the anti-cancer activity of the PARP1 inhibitor niraparib.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2018.1472190 PMID: 29923797
