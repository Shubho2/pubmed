Electronic address:Valeria.Manicardi@ausl.re.it.AIM: To assess the effect of metformin on cancer incidence in type 2 diabetes(T2DM), considering possible interactions with other glucose-lowering drugs anddiabetes duration.METHODS: Study cohort included diabetes patients aged 20-84 on December 2009,still alive and resident in Reggio Emilia province as of December 2011. Drugexposure was assessed for 2009-2011; subjects taking metformin continuously, withor without other hypoglycaemic drugs, were compared to subjects on diet-onlytherapy. The cohort was followed up from 2012 to 2014 through the cancerregistry. Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were computed using Poisson regression models for all sites, lung, breast, liver, colorectal,prostate and pancreatic cancer.RESULTS: The cohort includes 17,026 people with T2DM, 7460 taking metformin. 887 cancers occurred during follow-up, 348 among metformin users. Cancer risk wassimilar in T2DM patients using metformin and those on diet-only. The risk forprostate (IRR = 0.65; 95%CI:0.36; 1.17), liver (IRR = 0.82; 95%CI:0.36; 1.85) andbreast (IRR = 0.77; 95%CI:0.43; 1.40) cancers only was slightly reduced; for lung(IRR = 1.52; 95%CI:0.92; 2.50), pancreas (IRR = 1.51; 95%CI:0.59:3.89) andcolon-rectum (IRR = 1.71; 95%CI:0.94; 3.08) the risk was slightly increased.CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of antitumor effect of metformin. A possibledecrease only for breast, liver and prostate cancer, is compatible with randomfluctuations.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.DOI: 10.1016/j.diabres.2018.04.036 PMID: 29807100
