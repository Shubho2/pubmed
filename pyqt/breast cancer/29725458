China.Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in females globally and is more aggressive at later stages. Chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) isinvolved in the nuclear export of proteins and RNAs and has been associated with a number of malignancies. However, the clinicopathological significance of itsexpression in BC remains to be elucidated therefore this was investigated in the present study. CRM1 expression in 280 breast cancer tissues and 60 normal tissueswas retrospectively analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and westernblotting. IHC investigation demonstrated that CRM1 expression was significantlyincreased in BC compared with the normal breast epithelium (P<0.0001).Overexpression of CRM1 was markedly associated with poor prognosticcharacteristics, including larger tumor size (P=0.024), positive lymph nodemetastasis (P=0.032), invasive histological type (P=0.004) and distant metastasis(P=0.026). Significant associations were also observed between increased CRM1expression and the progesterone receptor (P=0.028) and Ki67 (P=0.019).Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients with high CRM1expression exhibited a reduced disease-free survival and overall survivalcompared with those with low CRM1 expression (P=0.013). In the multivariateanalysis, CRM1 expression (P=0.011), tumor size (P=0.001) and lymph nodemetastasis (P<0.001) were independent prognostic markers of BC. In conclusion,CRM1 serves an important role in BC and may serve as a predictive and prognostic factor for a poor outcome in patients with BC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8316 PMCID: PMC5920404PMID: 29725458
