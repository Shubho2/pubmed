We identified BRD4 (Bromodomain-Containing Protein 4), a member of the  Bromodomain and ExtraTerminal domain (BET) family, as a gene that distinguished T-bet+/high andT-bet-/low tumors. In clinical studies, BET inhibitors have been shown tosuppress inflammation in various cancers, suggesting a potential link betweenBRD4 and immune infiltration in cancer. Hence, we examined the BRD4 expressionand clinicopathological features of breast cancer.METHODS: The cohort consisted of a prospectively ascertained consecutive seriesof women with axillary node-negative breast cancer with long follow-up. Geneexpression microarray data were used to detect mRNAs differentially expressedbetween T-bet+/high (n = 6) and T-bet-/low (n = 41) tumors. Tissue microarrays(TMAs) constructed from tumors of 612 women were used to quantify expression ofBRD4 by immunohistochemistry, which was analyzed for its association with T-bet+ TILs, Jagged1, clinicopathological features, and disease-free survival.RESULTS: Microarray analysis indicated that BRD4 mRNA expression was up to44-fold higher in T-bet+/high tumors compared to T-bet-/low tumors(p = 5.38E-05). Immunohistochemical expression of BRD4 in cancer cells was alsoshown to be associated with T-bet+ TILs (p = 0.0415) as well as with Jagged1 mRNAand protein expression (p = 0.0171, 0.0010 respectively). BRD4 expressioncorrelated with larger tumor size (p = 0.0049), pre-menopausal status(p = 0.0018), and high Ki-67 proliferative index (p = 0.0009). Women with hightumoral BRD4 expression in the absence of T-bet+ TILs exhibited a significantlypoorer outcome (log rank test p = 0.0165) relative to other subgroups.CONCLUSIONS: The association of BRD4 expression with T-bet+ TILs, and T-bet+TIL-dependent disease-free survival suggests a potential link betweenBRD4-mediated tumor development and tumor immune surveillance, possibly throughBRD4's regulation of Jagged1 signaling pathways. Further understanding BRD4'srole in different immune contexts may help to identify an appropriate subset ofbreast cancer patients who may benefit from BET inhibitors without the risk ofdiminishing the anti-tumoral immune activity.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4653-6 PMCID: PMC6053709PMID: 30029633
