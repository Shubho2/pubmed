The termbasal-like derives from studies demonstrating tumor gene expression profiles thatinclude some transcripts characteristic of the basal cells of the normal adulthuman mammary gland and others associated with a subset of normal luminal cells. Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the profiles of basal-like tumors isan active area of investigation. More refined molecular analysis of patients'samples and genetic strategies to produce breast cancers de novo from definedpopulations of normal mouse mammary cells have served as complementary approachesto identify relevant pathway alterations. However, both also have limitations.Here, we review some of the underlying reasons, including the unifying conceptthat some normal luminal cells have both luminal and basal features, as well assome emerging new avenues of investigation.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).
