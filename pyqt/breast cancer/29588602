Thepurpose of this meta-analysis is to synthesize the evidence on the diagnosticperformance of abnormally expressed lncRNAs for BC.Materials and methods: Relevant studies were searched in multiple electronicdatabases. The Quality Assessment of Diagnosis Accuracy Studies II criteria were applied to assess the quality of included studies. The bivariate meta-analysismodel was applied to synthesize the diagnostic parameters using Stata 12.0software. Publication bias was judged in terms of the Deek's funnel plotasymmetry test.Results: We included 10 eligible studies, which comprised 835 BC patients and 725paired controls for this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity,diagnostic odds ratio, likelihood ratio positive, likelihood ratio negative, and area under the curve (AUC) of upregulated lncRNA expression signature inconfirming BC were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70-0.85), 0.80 (95% CI: 0.73-0.85), 14.61 (95%CI: 10.91-19.55), 3.90 (95% CI: 3.03-5.02), 0.27 (95% CI: 0.20-0.36), and 0.86,respectively. Stratified analyses yielded a sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI:0.80-0.86) for serum-based analysis, which was higher than plasma-based analysis,whereas plasma-based analysis revealed a greater specificity of 0.88 (95% CI:0.85-0.91). Moreover, lncRNA-homeotic genes (HOX) transcript antisense RNA showeda pooled specificity of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84-0.93) and AUC of 0.86, which weresuperior to performances by lncRNA-metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinomatranscript-1 and -H19 in diagnosing BC. Notably, the analysis based on cancersubtypes demonstrated that lncRNA expression signature could distinguishtriple-negative BC (lacks estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression) from non-triple-negative BC, with an AUC of 0.85.Conclusion: Upregulated lncRNAs reveal an immense potential as novel non-invasivebiomarker(s) that could complement BC diagnosis.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S152241 PMCID: PMC5860138PMID: 29588602
