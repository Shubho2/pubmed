Weexamined variation in cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, andCYP2C9) and tamoxifen biotransformation in AIAN patients with breast cancer (n = 42) from the Southcentral Foundation in Alaska and the Confederated Salish andKootenai Tribes in Montana. We tested for associations between CYP diplotypes andplasma concentrations of tamoxifen and metabolites. Only the CYP2D6 variation wassignificantly associated with concentrations of endoxifen (P = 0.0008) and4-hydroxytamoxifen (P = 0.0074), tamoxifen's principal active metabolites, aswell as key metabolic ratios. The CYP2D6 was also the most significant predictor of active metabolites and metabolic ratios in a multivariate regression model,including all four genes as predictors, with minor roles for other CYP genes. In AIAN populations, CYP2D6 is the largest contributor to tamoxifen bioactivation,illustrating the importance of validating pharmacogenetic testing for therapyoptimization in an understudied population.Â© 2018 The Authors.
