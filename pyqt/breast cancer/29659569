We found monoallelictruncating/functionally deleterious mutations in seven genes, including ATM andCHEK2, which have previously been associated with PrCa predisposition, and fivenew candidate PrCa associated genes involved in cancer predisposing recessivedisorders, namely RAD51C, FANCD2, FANCI, CEP57 and RECQL4. Furthermore, using in silico pathogenicity prediction of missense variants among 18 genes associatedwith breast/ovarian cancer and/or Lynch syndrome, followed by KASP genotyping in 710 healthy controls, we identified "likely pathogenic" missense variants in ATM,BRIP1, CHEK2 and TP53. In conclusion, this study has identified putative PrCapredisposing germline mutations in 14.9% of early-onset/familial PrCa patients.Further data will be necessary to confirm the genetic heterogeneity of inherited PrCa predisposition hinted in this study.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1007355 PMCID: PMC5919682PMID: 29659569  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
