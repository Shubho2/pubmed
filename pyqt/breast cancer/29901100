Nestin is a member ofthe class VI family of intermediate filament proteins, originally identified as amarker of neural stem cells and subsequently demonstrated to be expressed in BCand other cancer types. In normal breast tissue, nestin is expressed in thebasal/myoepithelial cells of the mammary gland. In BC, nestin identifiesbasal-like tumours and predicts aggressive behaviour and poor prognosis. Nestinexpression has also been detected in BC stem cells and newly-formed tumourvessels, being a factor in promoting invasion and metastasis. The present review provides an up-to-date overview of the involvement of nestin in processesfacilitating BC pathogenesis and progression.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4441 PMID: 29901100
