The PIP5K-dependent PIP2 generation can also actupstream of the oncogenic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Many studies have demonstrated various mechanisms of spatiotemporal regulation ofPIP5K catalytic activity. However, there are few studies on regulation of PIP5Kprotein stability. Here, we examined potential regulation of PIP5Kα, a PIP5Kisoform, via ubiquitin-proteasome system, and its implication for breast cancer. Our results showed that the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 (neural precursor cellexpressed, developmentally down-regulated gene 4) mediated ubiquitination andproteasomal degradation of PIP5Kα, consequently reducing plasma membrane PIP2level. NEDD4 interacted with the C-terminal region and ubiquitinated theN-terminal lysine 88 in PIP5Kα. In addition, PIP5Kα gene disruption inhibitedepidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced Akt activation and caused significantproliferation defect in breast cancer cells. Notably, PIP5Kα K88R mutant that wasresistant to NEDD4-mediated ubiquitination and degradation showed morepotentiating effects on Akt activation by EGF and cell proliferation thanwild-type PIP5Kα. Collectively, these results suggest that PIP5Kα is a noveldegradative substrate of NEDD4 and that the PIP5Kα-dependent PIP2 poolcontributing to breast cancer cell proliferation through PI3K/Akt activation isnegatively controlled by NEDD4.© 2018 The Authors.
