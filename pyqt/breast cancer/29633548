The diagnosis of breastcancer was occult at the time of donation. All of the recipients developed ahistologically similar type of breast cancer within 16 months to 6 years aftertransplantation. Three out of 4 recipients died as a result of widelymetastasized disease. One of the recipients survived after transplant nephrectomyfollowed by cessation of immunosuppression and chemotherapy. This extraordinarycase points out the often fatal consequences of donor-derived breast cancer andsuggests that removal of the donor organ and restoration of immunity can inducecomplete remission.© 2018 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society ofTransplant Surgeons.DOI: 10.1111/ajt.14766 PMID: 29633548
