The study results suggest educational material mayimprove rates of bone mineral density testing.INTRODUCTION: Educational materialsimprove bone mineral density (BMD) testing rates in high-risk patients, but theeffect is unknown in women diagnosed with breast cancer. Methods of deliveringeducational materials may also affect testing rates. The purposes of this studywere to determine the feasibility of the protocol and to pilot-test the effectsof educational material and its delivery methods on BMD testing rates.METHOD: Pilot randomized controlled trial with block randomization. Fifty-fourwomen (aged 65-75 and diagnosed with breast cancer ≥ 3 years ago (2010-2012) and not taking osteoporosis medication) were recruited from February to May 2016 and randomized to three groups: control without educational material, educationalmaterial delivered by postal mail, and educational material delivered by patient choice of postal mail, email, or text messaging. Outcome measures were primarily evaluated using self-report questionnaires.RESULTS: The participation rate, defined as the proportion of eligibleparticipants who consented to participate, was 39.1%. Primary outcome measure wasobtained for 98% of the recruited women. During the 6-month follow-up period, BMDtesting rates were significantly higher in the groups receiving educationalmaterials by mail (26%, 95%CI = 10 to 49) and by patient choice (18%, 95%CI = 5to 41), when compared with the control group (6%, 95%CI = 0.3 to 25). Educationalmaterial was associated with a 17% higher BMD testing rate.CONCLUSIONS: The study protocol is feasible for a large-scale study. Theeducational material intervention is broadly accepted by the study participantswith a promising positive effect on BMD testing rates.DOI: 10.1007/s11657-018-0469-x PMID: 29721623
