What's more, SET7 is involved inthe pathogenesisof alopecia aerate, breast cancer, tumor and cancer progression, atherosclerosis in human carotid plaques, chronic renal diseases, diabetes, obesity, ovariancancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pulmonary fibrosis.Therefore, there is urgent need to develop novel SET7 inhibitors. In this paper, based on DC-S239 which has been previously reported in our group, we employedscaffold hopping- and 2D fingerprint-based similarity searches and identifiedDC-S285 as the new hit compound targeting SET7 (IC50 = 9.3 μM). Both radioactive tracing and NMR experiments validated the interactions between DC-S285 and SET7followed by the second-round similarity search leading to the identificationofDC-S303 with the IC50 value of 1.1 μM. In cellular level, DC-S285 retardedtumor cell proliferation and showed selectivity against MCF7 (IC50 = 21.4 μM),Jurkat (IC50 = 2.2 μM), THP1 (IC50 = 3.5 μM), U937 (IC50 = 3.9 μM) cell lines.Docking calculations suggested that DC-S303 share similar binding mode with theparent compoundDC-S239. What's more, it presented good selectivity against other epigenetic targets, including SETD1B, SETD8, G9a, SMYD2 and EZH2. DC-S303 canserve as a drug-like scaffold which may need further optimization for drugdevelopment, and can be used as chemical probe to help the community to betterunderstand the SET7 biology.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23030567 PMID: 29498708
