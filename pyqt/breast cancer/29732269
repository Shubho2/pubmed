Epub 2016 Apr 28.A resolution adaptive deep hierarchical (RADHicaL) learning scheme applied tonuclear segmentation of digital pathology images.Janowczyk A(1), Doyle S(2), Gilmore H(3), Madabhushi A(1).Author information: (1)Department of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University,Cleveland, OH, USA.(2)Pathology & Anatomical Sciences, SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.(3)University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Surgical Pathology, Cleveland, OH,USA.Deep learning (DL) has recently been successfully applied to a number of imageanalysis problems. However, DL approaches tend to be inefficient for segmentationon large image data, such as high-resolution digital pathology slide images. For example, typical breast biopsy images scanned at 40× magnification containbillions of pixels, of which usually only a small percentage belong to the class of interest. For a typical naïve deep learning scheme, parsing through andinterrogating all the image pixels would represent hundreds if not thousands ofhours of compute time using high performance computing environments. In thispaper, we present a resolution adaptive deep hierarchical (RADHicaL) learningscheme wherein DL networks at lower resolutions are leveraged to determine ifhigher levels of magnification, and thus computation, are necessary to provideprecise results. We evaluate our approach on a nuclear segmentation task with acohort of 141 ER+ breast cancer images and show we can reduce computation time onaverage by about 85%. Expert annotations of 12,000 nuclei across these 141 imageswere employed for quantitative evaluation of RADHicaL. A head-to-head comparison with a naïve DL approach, operating solely at the highest magnification, yielded the following performance metrics: .9407 vs .9854 Detection Rate, .8218 vs .8489 F-score, .8061 vs .8364 true positive rate and .8822 vs 0.8932 positivepredictive value. Our performance indices compare favourably with state of theart nuclear segmentation approaches for digital pathology images.DOI: 10.1080/21681163.2016.1141063 PMCID: PMC5935259PMID: 29732269
