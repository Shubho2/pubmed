The role of wound dressings inthe prevention of SSI after breast cancer surgery is unclear. This study comparesa silver carboxymethylcellulose dressing (AQUACEL Ag Surgical (Aquacel) withstandard wound dressing in SSI rate after breast cancer surgery.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-centre randomized controlled trial among women ≥18years, diagnosed with breast cancer, undergoing breast conserving or ablativesurgery, was conducted in a combined in and outpatient setting. The intervention was the use of Aquacel, compared with standard gauze dressing. Primary outcomemeasure was SSI following CDC criteria.RESULTS: A total of 230 patients were analysed: 106 in the Aquacel group and 124 controls. Seven patients (6.6%) developed SSI in the Aquacel group and 16patients (12.9%) in the control group (RR 0.51 [95% Confidence Interval (CI):0.22-1.20]; p = 0.112; adjusted OR 0.49 [0.19-1.25] p = 0.135)). Unplannedexploratory subgroup analysis of breast conserving surgery patients showed thatSSI rate was 1/56 (1.8%) in the Aquacel group vs. 7/65 (10.8%) in controls;adjusted OR 0.15 [0.02-1.31] p = 0.087. The Aquacel group showed better patientsatisfaction (median 8 vs. 7 on a Numerical Rating Scale, p = 0.006), fewerdressing changes within 48 hours(adjusted OR 0.12 [0.05-0.27] p<0.001), fewerre-operations (0% vs. 3.2%, p = 0.062), and lower mean wound-related treatmentcosts, both in a high (€265.42 (SD = 908) vs. €470.65 (SD = 1223) [p<0.001]) and low (€59.12 (SD = 129) vs. €67.55 (SD = 172) [p<0.001]) attributable costs of SSImodel.CONCLUSION: In this randomized controlled trial in women undergoing surgery forbreast cancer, the use of AQUACEL Ag Surgical wound dressing did notsignificantly reduce the occurrence of SSIs compared to standard gauze dressing. The use of Aquacel resulted in significantly improved patient satisfaction,reduced dressing changes and reduced wound-related costs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.trialregister.nl: NTR5840.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0195715 PMCID: PMC5965831PMID: 29791437  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
