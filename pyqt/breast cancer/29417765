JNK1 and JNK2 have recentlybeen demonstrated to function independently, highlighting a new parameter in the study of the JNK pathway. In order for JNK1 and JNK2-specific roles to bedefined, better tools need to be employed. Previous studies have relied upon the broad spectrum JNK inhibitor, SP600125, to characterize the role of JNK signalingin a number of cell lines, including the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. In linewith previous literature, our study has demonstrated that SP600125 treatmentinhibited c-Jun and JNK phosphorylation and MCF-7 proliferation. However, inaddition to targeting JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3, SP600125 has been previouslydemonstrated to suppress the activity of a number of other serine/threoninekinases, making SP600125 an inadequate tool for JNK isoform-specific roles to be determined. In this study, lentiviral shRNA was employed to selectively knockdownJNK1, JNK2, and JNK1/2 in MCF-7 cells. Using this approach, JNK phosphorylationwas fully inhibited following stable knockdown of respective JNK isoforms.Interestingly, despite suppression of JNK phosphorylation, MCF-7 cellproliferation, cell cycle progression, or cell death remained unaffected. Thesefindings raise the question of whether JNK phosphorylation really is pivotal inMCF-7 cell growth and death or if suppression of these events is a result of one of the many off-targets cited for SP600125.Â© 2017 The Authors.
