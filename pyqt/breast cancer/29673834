Premenopausal RRSO results in acute menopause and isassociated with various menopausal symptoms. This study investigates the severityand duration of subjective menopausal symptoms after premenopausal RRSO andassociated factors.METHODS: We included 199 women who had undergone RRSO before age 52 in thiscross-sectional study. The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) was used to measure thelevel of psychological, somato-vegetative and urogenital symptoms (no/little,mild, moderate, or severe). Uni- and multivariate logistic regressions wereperformed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)for having moderate or severe symptoms as compared to having no or mild symptoms.Duration of symptoms was investigated by calculating the time since RRSO.RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent (137/199) of the included women reported moderate or severe symptoms on the MRS, a mean of 7.9 years after RRSO. Fifty-seven percent(94/137) of these women reported severe urogenital symptoms, and aboutone-quarter reported severe psychological and/or somato-vegetative symptoms. Onlypsychological symptoms tended to improve over time (>=10 years). A personalhistory of breast cancer was independently associated with having moderate orsevere menopausal symptoms (OR = 3.4; 95%CI = 1.6-7.1).CONCLUSIONS: The majority of women report moderate or severe menopausal symptoms,even 10 years after surgical menopause, and breast cancer survivors especially.To improve quality of life, follow-up care after RRSO should focus on thesesymptoms and be accessible for many years after RRSO.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
