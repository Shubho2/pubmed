[Epubahead of print]Biophysical and photobiological basics of water-filtered infrared-A hyperthermia of superficial tumors.Vaupel P(1), Piazena H(2), Müller W(3), Notter M(4).Author information: (1)a Department of Radiation Oncology and Radiotherapy , Klinikum rechts derIsar, Technische Universität München (TUM) , München , Germany.(2)b Medical Photobiology Group, Department of Internal Medicine , CharitéUniversity Medicine , Berlin , Germany.(3)c Physical Optics Consultant Office , Wetzlar , Germany.(4)d Department of Radiation Oncology , Lindenhofspital , Bern , Switzerland.Thermography-controlled, water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) is a novel, effectiveand approved heating technique listed in the ESHO quality assurance guidelinesfor superficial hyperthermia clinical trials (2017). In order to assess thespecial features and the potential of wIRA-hyperthermia (wIRA-HT), detailed andupdated information about its physical and photobiological background ispresented. wIRA allows for (a) application of high irradiances without skin pain and acute grade 2-4 skin toxicities, (b) prolonged, therapeutically relevantexposure times using high irradiances (150-200 mW/cm2) and (c) faster and deeper heat extension within tissues. The deeper radiative penetration depth is mainlycaused by forward Mie-scattering. At skin surface temperatures of 42-43 °C, theeffective heating depth is 15 mm (T ≥ 40 °C) and 20 mm (T ≥ 39.5 °C). Advantages of wIRA include its contact-free energy input, easy power steering by a feed-backloop, extendable treatment fields, real-time and noninvasive surface temperature monitoring with observation of dynamic changes during HT, and - if necessary -rapid protection of temperature-sensitive structures. wIRA makes the compliantheating of ulcerated and/or bleeding tumors possible, allows for HT ofirregularly shaped and diffusely spreading tumors, is independent of individualbody contours, allows for very short 'transits' between HT and RT (1-4 min) orcontinuous heating between both therapeutic interventions. New treatment options for wIRA-HT may include malignant melanoma, vulvar carcinoma, skin metastases of different primary tumors, cutaneous T-and B-cell lymphoma, large-areahemangiomatosis, inoperable squamous cell, basal cell and eccrine carcinoma ofthe skin with depth extensions ≤20 mm.DOI: 10.1080/02656736.2018.1469169 PMID: 29745269
