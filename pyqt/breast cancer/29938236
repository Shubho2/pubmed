Thiscross-sectional study aimed at investigating the perceived barriers towards BCscreening in Al Hassa, Saudi Arabia.Participants and methods. A total of 816adult Saudi women aged â‰¥ 30 years attending for routine primary health servicesor accompanying patients at the selected primary health care centers (PHCs) were randomly selected from 12 PHCs (8 urban and four rural) using multi-stagesampling method. Participants were invited to personal interview usingsemi-structured data collection instrument including inquiries aboutsocio-demographics, reproductive history, previous histories of diagnosed breast lesions and breast cancer. The perceived individual barriers towards screening,their attitudes, the reasons for not attending previously held screeningcampaigns in Al Hassa, were also included.Results: Low utilization of BC screening being significantly positivelyassociated with woman's age, higher educational status, higher family income,using hormonal contraception and positive history of previous breast as shown by the results of the logistic regression model. Exploratory factor analysis showed that personal fears (especially fear of doctors/examiners, fear of hospitals and health facilities and fear of consequences/results) were the major factors thathinder women from utilizing the free of charge BC screening with high loadingeigenvalue of 3.335, explaining 30.4% of the barriers.Conclusions: Educational interventions aim at improving breast cancer knowledgeand addressing barriers should be incorporated as core component of the screeningprogram in Saudi Arabia.DOI: 10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2018.59.1.689 PMCID: PMC6009066PMID: 29938236
