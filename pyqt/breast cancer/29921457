The aim of the study was to test whether the inflammatory marker, CRP at the time ofdiagnosis of breast cancer is associated with metastasis, recurrence, and deathin breast cancer patients from Malwa region of Punjab where breast cancer iswidely feared.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred and forty-two breast cancer patients and 242age and sex matched controls were included in the study. CRP levels wereestimated using fully automated bio analyzer Erba200. Follow up interviews wereconducted at an interval of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27 months todetermine the outcome among breast cancer patients.RESULTS: Elevated levels of CRP were found among the diseased in comparison with controls (P < 0.0001). Higher CRP levels associated significantly with pooroutcome including metastasis and recurrence among breast cancer patients [P =0.03; 95% confidence interval; odds ratio: 2.954 (0.9125-9.561)].CONCLUSION: Elevated levels of CRP associated significantly with increased riskof breast cancer and poor outcome. CRP estimation may be a simple and inexpensivetool for the risk assessment and outcome of the disease in Malwa region of Punjabwhere incidence of breast cancer is reported to be very high.Copyright Â© 2018.
