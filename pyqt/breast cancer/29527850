Aromatase inhibitors are often used in breastcancer patients during COH to prevent elevated levels of E2.OBJECTIVES: To describe our experience with COH for oocyte cryopreservation innon-breast cancer patients using aromatase inhibitors.METHODS: Of the five patients treated, two had an aggressive abdominal desmoidtumor, one had endometrial carcinoma, one had uterine sarcoma, and one patienthad a brain oligodendroglioma. In all cases the treating oncologist suggested an association between estrogen and possible tumor progression. All patients weretreated with a standard in vitro fertilization antagonist protocol combined with aromatase inhibitors, similar to the protocol used for breast cancer patients.RESULTS: The average duration of treatment was 10.5 days, mean peak E2 was 2348pmol/L, mean number of oocytes aspirated was 17.3, and a mean of 14.6embryos/oocytes were cryopreserved.CONCLUSIONS: COH with aromatase inhibitors is apparently effective in non-breast cancer patients and spares exposure to high E2 levels.PMID: 29527850
