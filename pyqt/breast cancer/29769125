The extent to which factors related to both these pathologic conditions concur to patientprognosis intensely animates the inherent research areas. The study hereinpresented aimed to the development of a tool for the assessment andstratification of risk of death and disease recurrence in early breast cancer.METHODS: Between 2008 and 2010, two hundreds thirty-five (N: 235) patientsdiagnosed with stage I-IIA breast cancer were included. Data on patientdemographics and clinic-pathologic features were collected in course offace-to-face interviews or actively retrieved from clinical charts. Plasma levelsof plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2),thrombin antithrombin complex (TAT), factor VIII (FVIII), and D-dimer (DD) weremeasured at breast cancer diagnosis and prior to any therapeutic procedure,including breast surgery. The risk of death was computed in terms of overallsurvival (OS), which was the primary outcome. For a subset of patients (N = 62), disease free survival (DFS) was also assessed as a measure of risk of diseaserecurrence.RESULTS: Median follow up was 95 months (range 6-112 months). Mean age atdiagnosis was 60.3 ± 13.4 years. Cancer cases were more commonly intraductalcarcinomas (N: 204; 86.8%), pT1 (131; 55.7%), pN0 (141; 60%) and G2 (126; 53.6%).Elevated levels of PAI-1 (113; 48.1%) represented the most frequent coagulationabnormality, followed by higher levels of F1 + 2 (97; 41.3%), DD (63; 27.0%), TAT(34; 40%), and FVIII (29; 12.3%). In univariate models of OS, age, pT, DD, FVIII were prognostically relevant. In multivariate models of OS, age (p = 0.043), pT(p = 0.001), levels of DD (p = 0.029) and FVIII (p = 0.087) were confirmed. Inthe smaller subgroup of 62 patients, lymph node involvement, percent expressionof estrogen receptors and levels of FVIII impacted DFS significantly.CONCLUSIONS: We developed a risk assessment tool for OS including patient- andcancer-related features along with biomarkers of coagulation activation in acohort of early BC patients. Further studies are warranted to validate ourprognostic model in the early setting and eventually extend its application torisk evaluation in the advanced setting for breast and other cancers.DOI: 10.1186/s12967-018-1511-x PMCID: PMC5956941PMID: 29769125
