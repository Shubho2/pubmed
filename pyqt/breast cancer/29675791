The aim of thisstudy was to determine the changes in PD-L1 expression of tumor cells (TC) andimmune cells (IC), in PD-1 expression of IC, and in the amount of stromalmononuclear cell infiltration after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the amount of stromal mononuclear cells and PD-L1/PD-1 expressions by immunohistochemistry in bronchoscopic biopsy samplesincluding 20 adenocarcinomas (ADC), 15 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 2 othertypes of non-small cell lung cancer, and 4 small cell lung cancers together with their corresponding surgical resection tissues after platinum-based chemotherapy.RESULTS: PD-L1 expression of TC decreased in ten patients (24.4%) and increasedin three patients (7.32%) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.051). Thedecrease in PD-L1 expression, however, was significant only in patients whoreceived cisplatin-gemcitabine combination (p = 0.020), while in thecarboplatin-paclitaxel group, no similar tendency could be observed (p = 0.432). There was no difference between ADC and SCC groups. Neither PD-1 expression northe amount of stromal IC infiltration showed significant changes afterchemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study, in which both PD-L1 and PD-1 expressionwere analyzed together with the amount of stromal IC infiltration in differenthistological subtypes of lung cancer before and after platinum-basedchemotherapy. Our results confirm that chemotherapy decreases PD-L1 expression ofTC in a subset of patients, therefore, rebiopsy and re-evaluation of PD-L1expression may be necessary for the indication of immune checkpoint inhibitortherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2642-4 PMID: 29675791  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
