We examined the cytological featuresin fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy smears obtained from 5 patients who werehistologically diagnosed with breast carcinoma with OGCs. We compared FNA andclinicopathological findings with results from the published literature.Histological assessment of the resected samples showed that all tumors exhibited a histological grade 1 phenotype with a predominant cribriform architecture. Fourpatients were estrogen receptor positive, and 1 patient showed a triple negative phenotype. All patients survived without tumor recurrence. In the FNA smears,tumor cells were arranged in loosely cohesive clusters, characterized by varying degrees of OGCs infiltration and rare formation of solid tumor nests.Occasionally, 2- or 3-dimensional clusters of tumor cells were found, accompaniedby OGCs at the peripheral regions. In all patients, tumor cells were smallwithout severe nuclear atypia. None of the patients showed significant backgroundnecrosis. In summary, cytological features of breast carcinoma with OGCs arecharacterized by loose aggregates of low grade tumor cells, the presence of OGCs,and the absence of necrosis, all of which were consistent with features reported previously. This peculiar form of breast tumors should be included in thedifferential diagnosis, when physicians encounter FNA findings including lowgrade ductal carcinoma with the admixture of multinucleated giant cells or OGCs.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.
