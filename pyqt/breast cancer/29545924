Theoptimal threshold of Ki67 in both settings, however, remains elusive. We usecomputer assisted image analysis (CAIA) to determine the optimal threshold forKi67 in predicting survival outcomes and differentiating luminal B from luminal Abreast cancers.Methods: Quantitative scoring of Ki67 on tissue microarray (TMA) sections of 440 invasive breast cancers was performed using Aperio ePathologyImmunoHistochemistry Nuclear Image Analysis algorithm, with TMA slides digitally scanned via Aperio ScanScope XT System.Results: On multivariate analysis, tumours with Ki67 â‰¥14% had an increasedlikelihood of recurrence (HR 1.941, p=0.021) and shorter overall survival (HR2.201, p=0.016). Similar findings were observed in the subset of 343 ER positive breast cancers (HR 2.409, p=0.012 and HR 2.787, p=0.012 respectively). The value of Ki67 associated with ER+HER2-PR<20% tumours (Luminal B subtype) was found tobe <17%.Conclusion: Using CAIA, we found optimal thresholds for Ki67 that predict apoorer prognosis and an association with the Luminal B subtype of breast cancer. Further investigation and validation of these thresholds are recommended.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24398 PMCID: PMC5837769PMID: 29545924
