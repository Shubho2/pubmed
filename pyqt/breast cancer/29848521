Giovanni Bosco Hospital, Turin, Italy.(2)SCDU Nephrology and Dialysis, S. Giovanni Bosco Hospital and University ofTurin, Turin Italy.A novel administration strategy of immunoglobulin treatment is represented byinjection of recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHUPH20) with subcutaneousimmunoglobulins. The use of facilitated subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment(fSCIG) for the treatment of autoimmune conditions is yet to be investigated. We present the case of a 56-year-old female patient with pemphigus vulgarispredominantly of the oral mucous membranes, previously treated for 24 months withazathioprine and medium doses of steroids, with only partial remission. When she came to our attention, a concomitant newly diagnosed infiltrating ductal breastcancer limited the use of immunosuppressive agents. She was started with fSCIG(25 g/monthly). After 18 months of follow-up, her breast cancer has beensuccessfully treated and a substantial decrease of the rate of bullous mucouslesions and improvement of time to lesion healing and resolution was observed.fSCIG might represent a steroid-sparing tool for the treatment of selected cases of pemphigus vulgaris.© BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article)2018.
