Electronic address: shubhangiss@rediffmail.com.DPP-IV "a moonlighting protein" has immerged as promising pathway to control Type2 diabetes as well as found to play key role in earlier stages of cancer. Here wehave reported design, synthesis and applications of aminocoumarin derivatives as DPP-IV inhibitors. Compounds have been synthesized and studied for their DPP-IVinhibition activity. Three compounds have shown moderate inhibition at 100 µMconcentration. All compounds were also screened for their anticancer activityagainst A549 (Lung cancer cell line), MCF-7 (Breast cancer cell line) using MTTassay. One of the compounds has shown very good anticancer activity with IC50value 24 ± 0.1 nM against A549 cell line.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
