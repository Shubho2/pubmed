In this study, we reported a consecutive series of 12 patientswith primary granular cell tumor of the breast observed at our institute,focusing attention on preoperative management, surgical approach, and long-termfollow-up. Eight cases (8/12; 66.78%) presented with left-breast tumors; in themajority of patients (11/12; 91.7%), the lesion was identified in one of theupper quadrants. Specifically, upper intern quadrants (10 cases) were moreaffected. Surgical excision was performed in all patients. Mean diameter atpathologic section was 11.4 mm (range: 5-22). Tumor relapse was reported only in one case (8.3%). Mean follow-up was 98.1 months (range: 1-192). We proposed amodel to explain the molecular mechanism of granular cell tumorigenesisassociating to the high level of S100 protein. Management of primary granularcell tumor of the breast requires a correct initial diagnosis using breastimaging associated with core biopsy. Surgical procedure with wide resection orquadrantectomy requires a careful evaluation of breast margins.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13036 PMID: 29900629
