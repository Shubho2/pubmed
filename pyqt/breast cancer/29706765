Mammographicbreast density (MBD) is one of the markers used to predict the riskstratification of breast cancer in patients. We aimed to assess the correlations among MBD, ultrasound breast composition (USBC), fibroglandular tissue (FGT), andthe amount of background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) in magnetic resonanceimaging, after considering the subjects' menopausal status.Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, the medical records'archives in a tertiary referral hospital were reviewed. Data including age,menopausal status, their mammograms, and ultrasound assessments were extractedfrom their records. All of their imaging studies were reviewed, and MBD, USBC,FGT, and BPE were determined, recorded, and entered into SPSS software foranalysis.Results: A total of 121 women (mean age = 42.7 ± 11.0 years) were included, ofwhich 35 out of 115 (30.4%) had reached menopause. Using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test for evaluating the trends among above mentioned 4 radiologic characteristicsin the total sample population, a significant positive relation was found betweeneach of these paired variables: (1) USBC-MBD (P = .006), (2) FGT-MBD (P = .001), (3) USBC-BPE (P = .046), (4) USBC-FGT (P = .036), and (5) BPE-FGT (P < .001).These trends were not found to be significant among premenopausal subjects.Conclusions: Considering the trends between different measures of breast density in the 3 radiologic modalities, these factors can be used interchangeably incertain settings.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418771971 PMCID: PMC5912268PMID: 29706765
