Electronic address: larias@unam.mx.p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is a serine/threonine kinase activated by the smallGTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. It is located in the chromosome 11q13 and is amplifiedand/or overexpressed in several human cancer types including 25-30% of breasttumors. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the control of a number offundamental cellular processes by phosphorylating its downstream substrates. Inaddition to its role in the cytoplasm, it is well documented that PAK1 also playscrucial roles in the nucleus participating in mitotic events and gene expression through its association and/or phosphorylation of several transcription factors, transcriptional co-regulators and cell cycle-related proteins, including Aurorakinase A (AURKA), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), the forkhead transcription factor(FKHR), estrogen receptor α (ERα), and Snail. More recently, PAK signaling hasemerged as a component of the DNA damage response (DDR) as PAK1 activityinfluences the cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation and promotes theexpression of several genes involved in the Fanconi Anemia/BRCA pathway. Thisreview will focus on the nuclear functions of PAK1 and its role in the regulationof DNA damage repair.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
