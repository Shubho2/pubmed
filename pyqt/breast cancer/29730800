PAH emissions data wereobtained from the Environmental Protection Agency. Linear regression analysis wasperformed using SPSS 23 software for Windows to analyze the association betweenPAH emissions and breast cancer incidence, adjusting for potential confounders.Age-adjusted incidence rates of female breast cancer were found beingsignificantly higher in more industrialized metropolitan SEER regions over theyears of 1973-2013 as compared to less industrialized regions. After adjustingfor sex, race, education, socioeconomic status, obesity, and smoking prevalence, PAH emission density was found to be significantly associated with female breast cancer incidence, with the adjusted β of 0.424 (95% CI 0.278, 0.570; p < 0.0001) for emissions from all sources and of 0.552 (95% CI 0.278, 0.826; p < 0.0001) foremissions from traffic source. This study suggests that PAH exposure from ambientair could play a role in the increased breast cancer risk among women living inurban areas of the US. Further research could provide insight into breast cancer etiology and prevention.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1150-3 PMID: 29730800
