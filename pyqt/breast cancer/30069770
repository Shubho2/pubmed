It isrationally designed to act as a competitive inhibitor of NAD+ at the catalyticsite of PARP1 and PARP2, both members of the PARP family of enzymes that arecentral to the repair of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) mediated via the baseexcision repair (BER) pathway. Inhibition of the BER pathway by olaparib leads tothe accumulation of unrepaired SSBs, which leads to the formation of deleterious double-strand breaks (DSBs). In cells with an intact homologous recombination(HR) pathway, these DSBs can be repaired effectively. However, in tumors withhomologous recombination repair deficiencies, olaparib causes synthetic lethalitythrough the combination of two molecular events that are otherwise nonlethal whenoccurring in isolation. Olaparib is already approved for the treatment ofpatients with recurrent ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation, and it has been shownto provide clinically meaningful benefits among such patients. It has also shown promising activity in patients with metastatic breast or prostate cancer and agermline BRCA mutation. Besides its usage as a single agent, olaparib can alsoact either as a chemo- and/or radiosensitizer, due to its ability to potentiatethe cytotoxic effects of these therapeutic agents. However, a clear patientbenefit for the latter application has not been demonstrated yet.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-91442-8_15 PMID: 30069770
