Theprovince of Ontario (13.6 million) has implemented a provincial programme toscreen for symptoms among cancer patients using the Edmonton Symptom AssessmentSystem (ESAS). The purpose of this study was to describe symptom burden in theyear after diagnosis among women with breast cancer.METHODS: This observational study linked cancer incidence, stage, treatment anddemographic data with ESAS scores collected at cancer clinic visits. The cohortconsisted of all adult women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer between2007 and 2013 who received surgery as their primary treatment and had at leastone symptom screening record. The prevalence and trajectory of moderate-to-severeand severe symptom scores in the year after diagnosis were described.Multivariable logistic regression models identified factors associated withmoderate-to-severe and severe symptom scores.RESULTS: The cohort included 23,840 breast cancer patients and with 90,556 uniquesymptom assessments, within the first year from diagnosis. Tiredness had thehighest incidence of moderate-to-severe scores; 60% reported at least onemoderate-to-severe score in the 12 months after diagnosis, followed by impairedwell-being (53%) and anxiety (44%). Elevated symptom scores were most commonlyreported in 6 months after diagnosis. Higher comorbidity score (AggregatedDiagnosis Group ≥10), more advanced stage at diagnosis, younger age, urbanresidence, lower income and treatment course were associated withmoderate-to-severe and severe symptom scores.CONCLUSION: These findings identify time points and patient subgroups at risk forelevated symptom scores and may benefit from personalised or targeted supportive care interventions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
