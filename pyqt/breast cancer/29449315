Here wedescribe genetic analysis of a 41-yr-old female patient with MBC andneurofibromatosis type I (NF1). She initially presented with pT3N1a, grade 3 MBC,but lung metastases were discovered subsequently. To identify the molecular causeof her NF1, we screened for germline mutations disrupting NF1 or SPRED1,revealing a heterozygous germline single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in exon 21 ofNF1 at c.2709G>A, Chr 17: 29556342. By report, this variant disrupts pre-mRNAsplicing of NF1 transcripts. No pathogenic mutations were identified in SPRED1 A potential association between MBC and NF1 was reported in eight previous cases,but none underwent detailed genomics analysis. To identify additional candidategermline variants potentially predisposing to MBC, we conducted targeted exomesequencing of 279 established cancer-causing genes in a control blood sample,disclosing four rare SNVs. Analysis of her breast tumor showed markedly alteredvariant allelic fractions (VAFs) for two (50%) of them, revealing somatic loss ofheterozygosity (LOH) at germline SNVs. Of these, only the VAF of the pathogenicSNV in NF1 was increased in the tumor. Tumor sequencing demonstrated five somaticmutations altering TP53, BRCA1, and other genes potentially contributing tocancer formation. Because somatic LOH at certain germline SNVs can enhance their impacts, we conclude that increased allelic imbalance of the pathogenic SNV inNF1 likely contributed to tumorigenesis. Our results highlight a need to assesspredisposing genetic factors and LOH that can cause rare, aggressive diseasessuch as MBC in NF1.Â© 2018 Suarez-Kelly et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.DOI: 10.1101/mcs.a002352 PMCID: PMC5880258PMID: 29449315
