China.The influence of Toll‑like receptor (TLR)4/myeloid differentiation factor (MyD)88signaling on the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells has been previouslyreported. The purpose of the present study was to determine the role ofTLR4/MyD88 in breast cancer cell migration and invasion, and to discover noveltherapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment. TLR4, MyD88 and high mobilitygroup box 1 (HMGB1) mRNA expression levels were assessed in highly invasive humanMDA‑MB‑231 breast cancer cells, breast cancer cells with a low rate of invasion(MCF‑7) and normal human MDA‑Kb2 mammary gland cells by reversetranscription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein expressionlevels of these markers were detected by western blotting and immunofluorescence.Randomly selected breast cancer and paracarcinoma tissues were used to measureTLR4 and MyD88 protein expression levels by immunohistochemistry. The mRNA andprotein expression levels of TLR4 and MyD88 were significantly higher inMDA‑MB‑231 cells compared with either MCF‑7 cells or MDA‑Kb2 cells. The mRNA and protein expression levels of HMGB1 were comparable in the two breast cancer cell lines, with no statistical difference (P>0.05). TLR4 and MyD88 protein expressionlevels were also significantly higher in breast cancer tissues compared withparacarcinoma tissues (P<0.05). TLR4 and MyD88 protein expression levels werepositively correlated with axillary lymph node metastasis and histological grade (P<0.05). TLR4/MyD88 expression levels were positively correlated with themetastasis of breast cancer cells. TLR4/MyD88 may be useful as a novel biomarker to evaluate the prognosis and treatment of patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9326 PMID: 30066873
