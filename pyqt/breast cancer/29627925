While African-American breast cancer survivors have beenreported to have higher levels of spirituality compared to White women, little isknown about how levels of spirituality may vary among African-American breastcancer survivors. The aims of this study were to examine factors associated with spirituality among African-American survivors and test whether spiritualitylevels were associated with women's attitudes about treatment or health care. Theprimary outcome, spirituality, was nine-item scale (Cronbach's α = .99).Participants completed standardized telephone interviews that capturedsociocultural, healthcare process, and treatment attitudes. Medical records were abstracted post-adjuvant therapy for treatment and clinical information. Inbivariate analysis, age was not correlated with spirituality (p = .40).Married/living as married women had higher levels of spirituality (m = 32.1) thansingle women (m = 30.1). Contextual factors that were associated with higherlevels spirituality were: collectivism (r = .44; p < 0.0001, Afrocentricworldview (r = .185; p = .01), and self-efficacy scale (r = .17; p = .02). Inmultivariable analysis, sociodemographic factors were not significant.Collectivism remained a robust predictor (p < 0.0001). Attitudes about theefficacy of cancer treatment were not associated with spirituality. The highlevels of spirituality in African-American survivors suggest consideration ofintegrating spiritual care within the delivery of cancer treatment. Futurestudies should consider how spirituality may contribute to positive coping and/orbehaviors in African-American women with high levels of spirituality.DOI: 10.1007/s10943-018-0611-5 PMID: 29627925
