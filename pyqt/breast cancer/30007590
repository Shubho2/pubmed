Paraneoplastic motor neurondiseases (MNDs) are even rarer, and frequently described in patients with breast cancer. We presented the first case of patient affected by HER2-positive breasttumor and possible paraneoplastic lower motor neuron disease. In literature, few cases are reported but no one highlights the tumor receptors' profile. Instead,HER2-positive breast cancers are prone to be related to anti-Yo-associatedparaneoplastic cerebellar disorders. Anti-onconeural antibodies positivity can berarely found, confirming that paraneoplastic MND have no specific biomarkers. Thepresence of CSF oligoclonal bands (OBs) suggests the presence of immune-mediated mechanism, in absence of other possible OBs causes.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
