However, its potential roles intumorigenesis remain greatly elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that miR-133b issignificantly suppressed in human breast cancer specimens, which is reverselycorrelated to histological grade of the cancer. Ectopic expression of miR-133bsuppresses clonogenic ability and metastasis-relevant traits in vitro, as well ascarcinogenesis and pulmonary metastasis in vivo. Further studies have identified Sox9, c-MET, and WAVE2 as direct targets of miR-133b, in which Sox9 contributesto all miR-133b-endowed effects including cell proliferation, colony formation,as well as cell migration and invasion in vitro. Moreover, re-expression of Sox9 reverses miR-133b-mediated metastasis suppression in vivo. Taken together, these findings highlight an important role for miR-133b in the regulation oftumorigenesis and metastatic potential of breast cancer and suggest a potentialapplication of miR-133b in cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0715-6 PMCID: PMC6030174PMID: 29970901
