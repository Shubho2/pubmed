However, this approach suffers from insufficient light penetration depth. In order to mitigate this issue, pollen-structured goldclusters (PSGCs) were designed for mediating X-ray-induced PDT for radiotherapyenhancement. The structure of PSGCs provides a large surface area that is able togenerate ROS upon X-ray irradiation. The synthesized PSGCs were exposed todifferent X-ray doses and the generated ROS was then quantified bydihydroethidium (DHE) assay. Furthermore, at the cellular level, the PDT efficacyof PSGCs was evaluated via immunofluorescence staining with &gamma;-H2AX andcomet assay. The results demonstrated that PSGCs possess a significantly highROS-generating capacity and a remarkable PDT efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer cells, thus showing potential clinical uses in deep-tissue cancertreatment.DOI: 10.3390/ma11071170 PMID: 29987236
