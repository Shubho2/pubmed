Purpose Tovalidate the role of unenhanced MRI (ue-MRI) compared to CE-MRI for assessingresponse to NAC in women with breast cancer. Material and Methods Seventy-onepatients with ongoing NAC for breast cancer underwent MRI before, during, and at the end of NAC. Ue-MRI was performed with T2-weighted sequences with iterativedecomposition of water and fat and diffusion-weighted sequences. CE-MRI wasperformed using three-dimensional T1-weighted sequences before and afteradministration of gadobenate dimeglumine. Two blinded observers rated ue-MRI and CE-MRI for the evaluation of tumor response. Statistical analysis was performedto compare lesion size and ADC values changes during therapy, as well asinter-observer agreement. Results There were no statistically significantdifferences between ue-MRI and CE-MRI sequences for evaluation of lesion size at baseline and after every cycle of treatment ( P > 0.05). The mean tumor ADCvalues at baseline and across the cycles of NAC were significantly different for the responder group. Conclusion Ue-MRI can achieve similar results to CE-MRI for the assessment of tumor response to NAC. ADC values can differentiate responders from non-responders.DOI: 10.1177/0284185118773512 PMID: 29742918
