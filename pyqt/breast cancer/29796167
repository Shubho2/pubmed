The effect of eribulin and paclitaxel incombination was tested, with both concurrent and sequential administration, usingfour TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, MDA-MB-157, and Mx-1) in vitro and inan MDA-MB-231 BALB/c-nu/nu mouse xenograft model. The expression ofepithelial-mesenchymal phenotypic markers was analyzed by western blotting andimmunohistochemical analyses. Simultaneous administration of eribulin andpaclitaxel resulted in a synergistic anti-tumor effect with MDA-MB-231 and Hs578Tcells, but not MDA-MB-157 and Mx-1 cells, in vitro. Moreover, pre-treatment with one drug significantly enhanced sensitivity to the subsequently administratedsecond drug in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells. Eribulin increased E-cadherinexpression and decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells. In contrast, paclitaxel increased the expression of mesenchymalmarkers. When epithelial-mesenchymal transition was induced by TGF-β1, eribulinsensitivity was enhanced. In contrast, a TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitordecreased eribulin sensitivity. In MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice, concurrentadministration of low doses of eribulin and paclitaxel significantly inhibitedtumor growth compared to that with either monotherapy. Moreover, singleadministration of eribulin before the initiation of paclitaxel treatmentdecreased vimentin expression and reduced the average tumor volume in a mousexenograft model. Eribulin and paclitaxel show synergistic anti-tumor effect byaltering the epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype. This combination therapy couldrepresent a novel therapeutic strategy for TNBC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25184 PMCID: PMC5955406PMID: 29796167
