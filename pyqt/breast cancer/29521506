Abnormal FA metabolism has been reported to be related tohuman diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Identification andquantification of FAs provide insights into their functions in biologicalsystems, but it is very challenging to analyze them due to their structures andproperties. In this work, we developed a novel method by integrating FAs taggedwith stable isotope labeled aminoxy tandem mass tags (aminoxyTMTs) and massspectrometric analysis in the positive mode. On the basis of their structures,the aminoxyTMT reagents reacted with the carboxylic acid group of the FAs,resulting in an amine group with high proton affinity covalently attached to the analytes. This enabled the analysis of FAs under the positive electrosprayionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) mode, which is normally more popular andsensitive compared to the negative mode. More importantly, the multiplexed TMTtags allowed us to quantify FAs from several samples simultaneously, whichincreased the experimental throughput and quantification accuracy. FAs extracted from three types of breast cells, i.e., MCF 10A (normal), MCF7 (minimallyinvasive) and MDA-MB-231 (highly invasive) cells, were labeled with thesix-plexed aminoxyTMTs and quantified by LC-MS/MS. The results demonstrated that the abundances of some FAs, such as C22:5 and C20:3, were markedly increased inMCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells compared to normal MCF 10A cells. For the first time, aminoxyTMT reagents were exploited to label FAs for their identificationand quantification in complex biological samples in the positive MS mode. Thecurrent method enabled us to confidently identify FAs and to accurately quantify them from several samples simultaneously. Because this method does not havesample restrictions, it can be extensively applied for biological and biomedical research.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00896 PMCID: PMC5937127 [Available on 2019-04-06]PMID: 29521506
