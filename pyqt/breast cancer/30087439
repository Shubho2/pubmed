P2X7 has a significant rolein mediating diverse cell responses, which upon dysregulation are associated withtumour initiation and development. The rapid, ATP-mediated activation of P2X7induces a fast-inward cation current in cells. However, prolonged ATP-mediatedactivation of P2X7 leads to formation of a pore that increases membranepermeability and eventually causes cell death. This presents a potential paradox,as the tumour microenvironment contains extracellular ATP at levels sufficient toactivate the P2X7 pore and trigger cell death. However, P2X7 expression isassociated with enhanced cancer cell survival, proliferation and metastaticpotential. At least one distinct conformational form of P2X7, termed non-porefunctional P2X7 (nfP2X7), has been described, which is not able to form afunctional pore. We demonstrate for the first time in this study that exposure toa high ATP concentration, equivalent to those measured in the tumourmicroenvironment, drives nfP2X7 expression and also that nfP2X7 is essential for tumour cell survival. We show that monoclonal antibodies raised against a P2X7amino acid sequence (200-216), whose conformation is distinct from that ofwild-type (WT) P2X7, bind specifically to nfP2X7 expressed on the surface oftumour cells. We also show that nfP2X7 is broadly expressed in patient-derivedtumour sections from a wide range of cancers. Therefore, antibodies raisedagainst E200 provide tools that can differentiate between forms of the P2X7receptor that have a key role in cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0426-6 PMID: 30087439
