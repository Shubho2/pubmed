The objective of the present observational study was to identifypatient and tumor characteristics and assess the role of radiotherapy (RT) inclinical practice.METHODS: Between 1998 and 2014, data of male BC patients treated at two breastcenters were consecutively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Patients were stratified based on the addition of adjuvant RT. Data on overall survival (OS)and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meiermethod and compared by the log-rank test.RESULTS: A consecutive cohort of 58 male BC patients was evaluated. Medianfollow-up was 56 months. Twenty-one patients (36.2%) received adjuvant RT.Overall, patients undergoing postoperative RT were characterized by morehigh-risk features. Patients receiving postoperative RT had significantly morefrequently a high UICC stage (50 vs. 9.7% UICC III, p = 0.018) and positive lymphnodes as compared to patients undergoing surgery alone (65 vs. 34.4% pN+,p = 0.046). Accordingly, there was a higher proportion of patients receivingaxillary lymph node dissection in the RT group (71.4 vs. 35.6%). Mastectomy wasperformed in 31/37 (86.1%) in the surgery group as compared to 14/21 (66.7%) inpatients receiving postoperative RT. In addition, RT patients were more likely toreceive endocrine therapy (78.9 vs. 39.3%, p = 0.016). Outcome was notsignificantly different between the groups (5-year LRFS: 89.8 vs. 80.0%,p = 0.471 and 5‑year OS 88.4 vs. 88.9%, p = 0.819).CONCLUSION: The present observational study evaluated the pattern of care in maleBC patients treated in clinical practice. Due to its rarity, randomized clinical trials are unlikely and male BC remains an entity with a poor evidence base.Nevertheless, RT remains a crucial component of the multidisciplinary treatmentstrategy in male BC.DOI: 10.1007/s00066-018-1337-8 PMID: 30046931
