These complexes exhibit moderateantiproliferative activity toward human ovarian, lung, hepatocellular, and breastcancer cell lines. Complex 2 in particular exhibits a low cross-resistance withcisplatin. The complexes show potent catalytic activity in the transferhydrogenation of NAD+ to NADH with formate as hydride donor in aqueous solution(310 K, pH 7). Substituents on the chelated ligand decreased the turnoverfrequency in the order Nb > Tf > Ts > Ms. An enhancement of antiproliferativeactivity (up to 22%) was observed on coadministration with nontoxicconcentrations of sodium formate (0.5-2 mM). Complex 2 binds to nucleobaseguanine (9-EtG), but DNA appears not to be the target, as little binding to calf thymus DNA or bacterial plasmid DNA was observed. In addition, complex 2 reactsrapidly with glutathione (GSH), which might hamper transfer hydrogenationreactions in cells. Complex 2 induced a dose-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest after24 h exposure in A2780 human ovarian cancer cells while promoting an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is likely to contribute to itsantiproliferative activity.DOI: 10.1021/acs.organomet.8b00132 PMCID: PMC5989272PMID: 29887657
