Autophagy is a constitutively active,evolutionarily conserved, catabolic process important for the maintenance ofhomeostasis in cellular stress responses and cell survival. Although themechanisms of autophagy have not yet been fully elucidated, emerging evidencesuggests that it plays a dual role in breast cancer and in maintaining theactivity of breast cancer stem cells (CSCs). However, it may play a complex role in breast CSC therapy. Breast CSCs, a population of cells with the ability toself-renew, differentiate, and initiate and sustain tumor growth, play anessential role in cancer recurrence, anticancer resistance and metastasis. Inaddition, the elucidation of the association between autophagy and apoptosis inthe tumor context is crucial in order to better address appropriate therapystrategies. In the present review, a summary of the mechanisms and roles ofautophagy in breast cancer and CSCs is presented. The potential value of suchautophagy modulators in the development of novel breast cancer therapies isdiscussed.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4270 PMID: 29436618
