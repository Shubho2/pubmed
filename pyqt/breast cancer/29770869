Phase I/II trial of curcumin alone or withchemotherapeutic drugs has been accomplished in pancreatic, colon, prostate andbreast cancer cases. Recently, autocrine growth hormone (GH) signaling-inducedcell growth, metastasis and drug resistance have been demonstrated in breastcancer. In this study, our aim was to investigate the potential therapeuticeffect of curcumin by evaluating the molecular machinery of curcumin-triggeredapoptotic cell death via focusing on NF-κB signaling and polyamine (PA)metabolism in autocrine GH-expressing MCF-7, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells. For this purpose, a pcDNA3.1 (+) vector with a GH gene insert wastransfected by a liposomal agent in all breast cancer cells and then selectionwas conducted in neomycin (G418) included media. Autocrine GH-induced curcuminresistance was overcome in a dose-dependent manner and curcumin inhibited cellproliferation, invasion-metastasis and phosphorylation of p65 (Ser536), andthereby partly prevented its DNA binding activity in breast cancer cells.Moreover, curcumin induced caspase-mediated apoptotic cell death by activatingthe PA catabolic enzyme expressions, which led to generation of toxic by-productssuch as H2O2 in MCF-7, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231 GH+ breast cancer cells. Inaddition, transient silencing of SSAT prevented curcumin-induced cell viabilityloss and apoptotic cell death in each breast cancer cells. In conclusion,curcumin could overcome the GH-mediated resistant phenotype via modulating cellsurvival, death-related signaling routes and activating PA catabolic pathway.DOI: 10.1007/s00726-018-2581-z PMID: 29770869
