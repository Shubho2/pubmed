However, the effect of paeonol and the mechanism of CXCL4/CXCR3-B signals in paeonol-induced breast cancer cell remain unknown.MATERIALS AND METHODS: After MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with paeonol orDMSO, the proliferation activity was detected by MTT(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), Hoechst, Terminaldeoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), andAnnexin-V/propidium iodide staining flow cytometry. Western blot andimmunohistochemistry of human breast cancer and noncancerous tissues wereperformed to determine the molecular alteration of CXCL4/CXCR3-B signals.RESULTS: Compared with the control, paeonol-treated breast cancer cells had lowproliferation activity and high apoptotic index, indicating that paeonol induces breast cancer cell apoptosis. Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed thatpaeonol increased CXCR3-B signal, downregulated CXCL4, heme oxygenase (HO-1) witha corresponding increased BACH1, and decreased nuclear factor E2-related factor 2(Nrf2).CONCLUSIONS: Thus, CXCL4/CXCR3-B may be involved in the mechanism of apoptosisinduced by paeonol in breast cancer cells by regulating the expression of BACH1and Nrf2 to downregulating HO-1 and promote apoptosis. Therefore, the authorssuggest paeonol has a significant growth inhibitory effect on breast cancercells, which may be related to the induction of apoptosis.DOI: 10.1089/cbr.2018.2450 PMID: 29847158
