Increasedexpression of matrix metalloproteinase‑9 (MMP‑9) via nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB)activation has been demonstrated to promote breast cancer cell invasion. In thepresent study, the involvement of CK2 in protein kinase C (PKC) induced cellinvasion in MCF‑7 breast cancer cells was investigated as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. The mRNA and protein levels of MMP‑9 in MCF‑7 cells wereinvestigated using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blot analyses and a zymography assay. Cell invasiveness was investigated using a Matrigel invasion assay, and it was revealed that small interfering RNAspecific for CK2 suppressed PKC induced cell invasion by regulating MMP‑9expression via activation of the p38 kinase/c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase/NF‑κBpathway. In addition, it was demonstrated that CK2 inhibitors [apigenin (20 µM), emodin (20 µM) or 2‑dimethylamino‑4,5,6,7‑tetrabromo‑1H‑benzimidazole (2 µM)]suppressed PKC induced cell invasion and MMP‑9 expression. The results of thepresent study suggested that CK2 is an important factor involved in the inductionof MCF‑7 breast cancer cell invasion by PKC. Therefore, CK2 may represent novelcandidates for therapy intended to inhibit invasion in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8885 PMID: 29658601
