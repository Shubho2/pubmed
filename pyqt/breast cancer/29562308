We focused on colorectal cancer.Materials and methods: We obtained cancer death certification data from stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, ovary, prostate, bladder, leukaemia, and total cancers from the World Health Organisation database and projectedpopulation data from Eurostat. We derived figures for France, Germany, Italy,Poland, Spain, the UK, and the EU in 1970-2012. We predicted death numbers by agegroup and age-standardized (world population) rates for 2018 through joinpointregression models.Results: EU total cancer mortality rates are predicted to decline by 10.3% in menbetween 2012 and 2018, reaching a predicted rate of 128.9/100 000, and by 5.0% inwomen with a rate of 83.6. The predicted total number of cancer deaths is1 382 000 when compared with 1 333 362 in 2012 (+3.6%). We confirmed a furtherfall in male lung cancer, but an unfavourable trend in females, with a rate of14.7/100 000 for 2018 (13.9 in 2012, +5.8%) and 94 500 expected deaths, higherthan the rate of 13.7 and 92 700 deaths from breast cancer. Colorectal cancerpredicted rates are 15.8/100 000 men (-6.7%) and 9.2 in women (-7.5%); declinesare expected in all age groups. Pancreatic cancer is stable in men, but in women it rose +2.8% since 2012. Ovarian, uterine and bladder cancer rates are predictedto decline further. In 2018 alone, about 392 300 cancer deaths were avoidedcompared with peak rates in the late 1980s.Conclusion: We predicted continuing falls in mortality rates from major cancersites in the EU and its major countries to 2018. Exceptions are pancreatic cancerand lung cancer in women. Improved treatment and-above age 50 years-organizedscreening may account for recent favourable colorectal cancer trends.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy033 PMID: 29562308
