Their specific interplays have been thought to determine gene expressionand downstream biological functions. However, it is still a big challenge toanalyze such interactions due to various limitations including rather weak,transient, and complicated interactions between HPTMs and readers, the highdynamic property of HPTMs, and the low abundance of reader proteins. Here wesought to take advantage of DNA-templated and photo-cross-linking techniques todesign a group of combinatorial histone PTM peptide probes for the identificationof multivalent interactions among histone PTMs and readers. By use oftrimethylation on histone H3K4 (H3K4me3) and phosphorylation on H3T3, wedemonstrated that this approach can be successfully utilized for identificationof the PTM crosstalk on the same histone. By use of H3K4me3 and acetylation onH4K16, we showed the potential application of the probe in the multivalentinteractions among PTMs on different histones. Thus, this new chemical proteomicstool combined with mass spectrometry holds a promising potential in profiling of the readers of combinatorial HPTMs and characterization of crosstalk amongmultiple PTMs on histones and can be adapted for broad biomedical applications.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b05174 PMID: 29465975
