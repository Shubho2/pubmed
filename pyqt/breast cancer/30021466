Acohort of 11 626 women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwentmastectomy with pathologically positive lymph nodes were accrued from theNational Cancer Database (2004-2008). Standard Cox regression, time-dependent(TD), and landmark models were used to compare overall survival in patients whodid or did not receive postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT). Simulationstudies showing ways to reduce the effect of ITB indicate that TD exposuresshould be included as variables in hazard-based analyses. Standard Cox regressionmodels comparing overall survival in patients who did and did not receive PMRTshowed a significant treatment effect (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.93, 95% confidenceinterval [CI]: 0.88-0.99). Time-dependent and landmark methods estimated notreatment effect with HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.03 and HR: 0.98, 95% CI, 0.92to 1.04, respectively. In our simulation studies, the standard Cox regressionmodel significantly overestimated treatment effects when no effect was present.Estimates of TD models were closest to the true treatment effect. Landmark model results were highly dependent on landmark timing. Appropriate statisticalapproaches that account for ITB are critical to minimize bias when examiningrelationships between receipt of PMRT and survival.DOI: 10.1177/1073274818789355 PMCID: PMC6053873PMID: 30021466
