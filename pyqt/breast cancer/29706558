We aimed to identify new candidate genes associated withpredisposition to hereditary diffuse gastric cancer in affected families without pathogenic CDH1 variants.METHODS: We did whole-exome sequencing on DNA extracted from the blood of 39individuals (28 individuals diagnosed with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and 11 unaffected first-degree relatives) in 22 families without pathogenic CDH1variants. Genes with loss-of-function variants were prioritised usinggene-interaction analysis to identify clusters of genes that could be involved inpredisposition to hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.FINDINGS: Protein-affecting germline variants were identified in probands fromsix families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer; variants were found in genesknown to predispose to cancer and in lesser-studied DNA repair genes. Aframeshift deletion in PALB2 was found in one member of a family with a historyof gastric and breast cancer. Two different MSH2 variants were identified in two unrelated affected individuals, including one frameshift insertion and onepreviously described start-codon loss. One family had a unique combination ofvariants in the DNA repair genes ATR and NBN. Two variants in the DNA repair geneRECQL5 were identified in two unrelated families: one missense variant and asplice-acceptor variant.INTERPRETATION: The results of this study suggest a role for the known cancerpredisposition gene PALB2 in families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and no detected pathogenic CDH1 variants. We also identified new candidate genesassociated with disease risk in these families.FUNDING: UK Medical Research Council (Sackler programme), European ResearchCouncil under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (2007-13),National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre,Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, and Cancer Research UK.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).
