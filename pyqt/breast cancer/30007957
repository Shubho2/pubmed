In this study, we aimed toinvestigate the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)-dependent mechanism by which thelncRNA GAS5 contributes to the development of breast cancer.METHODS: A total of 68 breast cancer patients were enrolled, and breast cancerand adjacent normal tissues were collected. The human breast cancer cell linesMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, BT549, SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 and human breast cell lineMCF10A were utilized in this study. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerasechain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were performed to detect expressionof relative factors. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) was used to evaluate therelationship between GAS5 and miR-23a, and a dual luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to assess the relationship between ATG3 and miR-23a. A subcutaneous xenograft nude mouse model was generated to examine the role of GAS5 and itsregulatory pathway in autophagy.RESULTS: GAS5 levels were frequently decreased in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, and its relatively low expression was closely related to a larger tumoursize, advanced tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer tissues. More importantly, we found that GAS5 promotedautophagy, with enhanced autophagosome formation after GAS5 overexpression. GAS5 was found to act as a microRNA sponge in a pathway that included miR-23a and its target gene ATG3. The GAS5-miR-23a-ATG3 axis significantly regulated autophagy invivo and in vitro.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we report that the GAS5-miR-23a-ATG3 axis can beregarded as a key regulator of autophagy pathways in breast cancer; it mayconstitute a promising biomarker and therapeutic target in the future.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
