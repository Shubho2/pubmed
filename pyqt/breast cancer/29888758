Many mutation sources result in characteristic mutation signatures, which can be deduced from tumor genomic DNA sequences.Examples include spontaneous hydrolytic deamination of methyl-cytosine bases inCG motifs (AGEING signature) and C-to-T and C-to-G mutations in 5'-TC(A/T) motifs(APOBEC signature).Methods: The deconstructSigs R package was used to analyze single basesubstitution mutation signatures in over 1000 cancer cell lines. Two additionalapproaches were used to analyze the APOBEC mutation signature.Results: Most cell lines show evidence for multiple mutation signatures. Forinstance, the AGEING signature, which is the largest source of mutation in mostprimary tumors, predominates in the majority of cancer cell lines. The APOBECmutation signature is enriched in cancer cell lines from breast, lung, head/neck,bladder, and cervical cancers, where this signature also comprises a largefraction of all mutations.Conclusions: The single base substitution mutation signatures of cancer celllines often reflect those of the original tumors from which they are derived.Cancer cell lines with enrichments for distinct mutation signatures such asAPOBEC have the potential to become model systems for fundamental research on theunderlying mechanisms and for advancing clinical strategies to exploit theseprocesses.DOI: 10.1093/jncics/pky002 PMCID: PMC5993214PMID: 29888758
