Therelationship of AR expression and clinicopathological characteristics wascalculated using chi square test. Multivariate analysis using binary Logisticregression was used to analyze correlations of different factors with PCR.Result: All patients were female, with the age of 20-76 years old. AR wasdetected in 74.6% of tumors, and significantly correlated with hormone receptor(HR), human epidermalgrowth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), Ki-67, CK5/6, epidermalgrowth factor receptor (EGFR) and molecular subtypes (all P<0.05). Multivariateanalysis showed that AR, HR and HER-2 were independent predictors for PCR (allP<0.05). Conclusions: The expressions of AR were more frequently in HR positivebreast cancer tissues (86.7%), and lowest in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)group (23.2%). AR was independent predictor for PCR.Publisher: 目的：探讨AR在接受新辅助化疗乳腺癌组织中的表达及与临床病理特征的关系，并分析AR在预测病理完全缓解率中的意义。方法：回顾收集河南省肿瘤医院2014年3月至2017年6月期间行新辅助化疗患者的病例资料共668例。采用χ(2)检验比较AR表达与临床病理特征关系，应用Logistic回归分析各个变量与PCR的相关性。结果：入组患者均为女性，年龄20～76岁。AR阳性率74.6%，AR表达和HR、HER－2、Ki－67、CK5/6、EGFR及分子分型相关(P<0.05)。多因素分析：AR、HR及HER－2均为PCR独立预测因素(P<0.05)。 结论：AR更多的表达在HR阳性乳腺癌组织中(86.7%)，而在TNBC组表达率最低(23.2%)。AR是PCR的独立预测因素。.PMID: 29534389
