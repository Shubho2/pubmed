However, the metastaticprocess is still poorly understood. The mRNA microarray datasets GSE26910 andGSE33447 show that CXCL10 is up-regulated in BC, and the microRNA microarraydataset GSE38167 and a network meta-analysis of microRNA expression profilestudies in human BC suggest that microRNA-34a (miR-34a) is down-regulated in BC. CXCL10 was predicted as a target of miR-34a by microRNA.org. In this study, weuncovered a CXCL10-independent mechanism by which miR-34a exerts itsantimetastatic activity in BC.METHODS: To investigate the clinical significance of miR-34a in BC, we collected cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues from 258 patients with BC. In addition, a series of inhibitors, mimics, and siRNAs was introduced into MCF-7 and T47Dcells to validate the regulatory mechanisms by which miR-34a regulates CXCL10.Next, to better understand the pivotal role of TLR signaling pathway inhibitionin MCF-7 and T47D cells, we blocked the TLR signaling pathway using OxPAPC, anantagonist of TLR signaling.RESULTS: Among BC patients, miR-34a was down-regulated, CXCL10 was up-regulated, and the TLR signaling pathway was activated. Determination of luciferase activityrevealed that CXCL10 was a target of miR-34a. Through gain- and loss-of-function studies, miR-34a was demonstrated to negatively regulate CXCL10; inhibitactivation of the TLR signaling pathway; significantly suppress in vitro cellproliferation, migration, and invasion; and induce apoptosis.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that functional loss or suppression of the tumorsuppressor CXCL10 due to induction of miR-34a leads to inhibition of the TLRsignaling pathway during breast tumorigenesis, providing a novel target for themolecular treatment of breast malignancies.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
