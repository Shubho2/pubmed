Considering the lack of predictivemarkers for TNBC, we aimed to examine the contribution of excision repair crosscomplementing-group 1 (ERCC1) genotypes to TNBC. The rs11615 and rs3212986 ofERCC1 were investigated and evaluated for their associations with susceptibility to breast cancer, especially TNBC, in Taiwan. In this study, 1,232 breast cancer patients (104 were TNBC) and 1,232 healthy controls were recruited and theirgenotypes at ERCC1 rs11615 and rs3212986 were revealed by polymerase chainreaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Ourresults indicated that genotypes of ERCC1 rs11615 (Ptrend = 2.2*10E-9), but notrs3212986 (Ptrend = 0.6181), were associated with breast cancer risk. In theallelic frequency distribution analysis, breast cancer patients carried the Tallele of ERCC1 rs11615 a higher rate than the control subjects, furthersupporting the idea that ERCC1 rs11615 TT genotype is positively associated with breast cancer susceptibility. More importantly, the frequency of the ERCC1rs11615 TT genotype was even higher among TNBC patients than among other subtypesof breast cancer patients (P = 0.0001, odds ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval= 1.15-2.63). The genotypes of ERCC1 rs11615 were not associated with Ki67status. Our findings firstly show that the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615 can serve asa predictive biomarker for breast cancer and TNBC. We believe that ERCC1 couldserve as a target for personalized treatment of breast cancer, especially forTNBC.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0202112 PMID: 30096175
