These aspects can bede-regulated and consequently lead to a worsening of cancer progression. Inrecent years an association between the scaffolding protein Na+/H+ exchangerregulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) and tumor microenvironment changes in breast cancer (BC) has been reported.METHODS: Subcellular NHERF1 localization, vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF), its receptor VEGFR1, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), TWIST1expression and microvessel density (MVD) in 183 invasive BCs were evaluated,using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (TMA). Immunofluorescence wasemployed to explore protein interactions.RESULTS: Cytoplasmic NHERF1(cNHERF1) expression was directly related tocytoplasmic VEGF and VEGFR1 expression (p = 0.001 and p = 0.027 respectively),and inversely to nuclear HIF-1α (p = 0.021) and TWIST1 (p = 0.001). Further,immunofluorescence revealed an involvement of tumor cells with NHERF1 positivestaining in neo-vascular formation, suggesting a "mosaic" structure developmentof these neo-vessels. Survival analyses showed that loss of nuclear TWIST1(nTWIST1) expression was related to a decrease of disease free survival (DFS)(p < 0.001), while nTWIST1-/mNHERF1+ presented an increased DFS with respect tonTWIST1+/mNHERF1- phenotype (p < 0.001). Subsequently, the analyses ofnTWIST1+/cNHERF1+ phenotype selected a subgroup of patients with a worse DFScompared to nTWIST1-/cNHERF1- patients (p = 0.004).CONCLUSION: Resulting data suggested a dynamic relation between NHERF1 and TMEmarkers, and confirmed both the oncosuppressor role of membranous NHERF1expression and the oncogene activity of cytoplasmic NHERF1.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0766-7 PMCID: PMC5930748PMID: 29716631
