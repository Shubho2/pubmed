This rash should also raisesuspicion for metastasis, which can be confused with herpes zoster.OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to explain the reconstruction flapsensory reinnervation mechanism based on the clinical findings and provide adiagnostic and management algorithm of zosteriform rash in breast cancerpatients.METHODS: On November 15, 2017, we conducted a search of published articles inMEDLINE and Cochrane databases. All the articles describing a zosteriform rash ina patient with a history of breast cancer were included in this review.RESULTS: Eleven articles from the literature and 1 case from our practice wereselected for inclusion in this systematic review. Five patients had a breastreconstruction with a flap. The flap skin was affected by the rash in 4 of these patients, providing an objective proof of the reinnervation of the reconstructed breast. In 6 patients, the presentation was typical, and the diagnosis of herpes zoster was made without additional diagnostic testing. In 4 cases, the eruptionwas atypical, and a biopsy was done to confirm the diagnosis of a cancermetastasis. In 2 patients, the rash was multidermatomal, and a polymerase chainreaction was done to confirm the diagnosis of disseminated herpes zoster.CONCLUSIONS: Zoster reactivation in breast reconstructed patients is an objectiveproof of the reinnervation of the skin flap. Moreover, zosteriform rash in cancerpatients should raise suspicion for metastasis, which can be confused with herpeszoster.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001505 PMID: 29851724
