Docetaxel monotherapy wasadministered in 4.2%, whilst most patients received polychemotherapy.Non-hematological adverse events included skin reactions in 32.7% of thesubjects. Multiple adverse events were reported and most commonly includedasthenia (66.5%), alopecia (43.4%), and diarrhea (24.2%). It is noteworthy thatno fatal toxicities occurred. Several hematological adverse events were reported during treatment, with anemia being the most common.Conclusion: The results of this real-life experience, characterized by arelatively large sample size and long follow-up, confirm that docetaxel iseffective and well tolerated in early-stage breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1159/000481339 PMCID: PMC5981632 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29887789
