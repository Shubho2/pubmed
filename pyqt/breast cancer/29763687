Electronic address:wangyongjun@syphu.edu.cn.Docetaxel (DTX) solution is among the most widely-used parenteral formulationsused in advanced breast cancer therapy. However, severe side effects have beenobserved due to the use of ethanol and polysorbate 80. Herein, a novel DTX-based prodrug, docetaxel-linoleic acid conjugate (DTX-LA) was successfully synthesized.The high lipid solubility of DTX and DTX-LA resulted in a tendency for them tobecome entrapped in the oil core of the emulsions. As anticipated, nano-sized,sterically stabilized oil-in-water lipid emulsions (LMs) of DTX-LA LMs and DTXLMs were successfully constructed. Unlike DTX solution, LMs exhibited highcolloidal stability and sustained-release behavior, having a narrow sizedistribution that was ∼220 nm in diameter. Compared with DTX LMs, DTX-LA LMs had a greater drug-loading capacity. Although the cytotoxicity of DTX-LA LMs wasreduced in comparison with DTX solution, the pharmacokinetic study demonstratedincreased bioavailability (p < 0.001) and half-life (p < 0.01). Finally, DTX-LALMs displayed significant antitumor efficacy with reduced side effects in a 4T1breast cancer xenograft model. Thus, the novel lipid emulsion-based docetaxelprodrug delivery system may be a promising strategy for improving intravenousadministration for breast cancer treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
