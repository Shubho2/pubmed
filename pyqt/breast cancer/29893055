This phase I trial was conducted to assess the safety, dose-limitingtoxicities (DLTs), and maximum-tolerated dose of cipatinib in HER2-positivepatients with advanced breast cancer.METHODS: Eligible adults with advanced breast cancer were administered cipatinib 200 mg/day (n = 3) as an initial dose, with escalating dosages of 400 mg (n = 4),800 mg (n = 2), 1200 mg (n = 3), 1400 mg (n = 3), 1600 mg (n = 3), and 1800 mg(n = 2) in 21 day cycles. DLTs were monitored until the end of cycle 2. Physical examinations, vital signs, blood sampling for hematology, clinical chemistry, andpharmacokinetics were performed throughout the trial.RESULTS: Of the 26 subjects enrolled, 23 completed the trial. A total of 143adverse events (AEs) were reported, of which 87 were associated with cipatinibtreatment and comprised: neutropenia (38%), hypertriglyceridemia (15%), fatigue(15%), nausea (12%), fever (19%), and myocardial ischemia (19%). Six AEs weregraded 3-4 (neutropenia, increases in aspartate aminotransferase, and totalbilirubin, fatigue, dizziness and nodal tachycardia), but none of the AEsobserved were considered to be DLTs.CONCLUSION: This tolerability study revealed that despite a mild toxicityprofile, cipatinib was well tolerated up to the anticipated maximum dosage of1800 mg/m2 . Further clinical trials are warranted.© 2018 The Authors.
