It is also a key player in ubiquitination of histone H2A which affectsgene expression pattern involved in various cellular processes such as cellproliferation, growth, DNA repair, apoptosis and senescence. In many cancers,Overexpression of BMI1correlates with advanced stages of disease, aggressiveclinicopathological behavior, poor prognosis resistance to radiation andchemotherapy. BMI1 is emerging as a key player in EMT, chemo-resistance andcancer stemness. Overexpression is observed in various cancer types such asbreast, primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric, ovarian, head and neck, pancreatic and lung cancer. Studies have shown that experimental reduction of BMIprotein level in tumor cells results in inhibition of cell proliferation,induction of apoptosis and/or senescence, and increases susceptibility tocytotoxic agents and radiation therapy. Thus, inhibition of BMI1 expressionparticularly in breast cancer stem cells can be used as a potential strategy for the complete elimination of tumor and to prevent disease relapse. On other handPTEN is known to be an important tumor suppressor next to p53. In many cancersparticularly in breast cancer, p53 and PTEN undergo mutations. Studies haveindicated the functional and mechanistic link between the BMI-1oncoprotein andtumor suppressor PTEN in the development and progression of cancer. The currentreview focuses on recent findings of how oncogenicity and chemo-resistance arecaused by BMI1. It also highlights the transcriptional regulation between BMI1and PTEN that dictates the therapeutic outcome in cancers where the functionalp53 is absent. Herein, we have clearly demonstrated the regulation oftranscription at genomic loci of BMI1 and PTEN in cancerous tissue or cells andthe possible epigenetic regulation by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) atBMI1 and PTEN loci that may provide some clue for the possible therapy againstTNBC in near future.Copyright Â© 2018.
