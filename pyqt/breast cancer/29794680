For women withbreast cancer, bone mineral density screening is recommended with long-termaromatase inhibitor use because of the risk of osteoporosis due to estrogendeficiency. Based on long-term adverse effects and complication safety data, whencompared with tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors are associated with a reducedincidence of thrombosis, endometrial cancer, and vaginal bleeding. For women withpolycystic ovary syndrome and a body mass index greater than 30, letrozole shouldbe considered first-line therapy for ovulation induction because of the increasedlive birth rate compared with clomiphene citrate. Lifestyle changes that resultin weight loss should be strongly encouraged. Aromatase inhibitors are apromising therapeutic option that may be helpful for the management ofendometriosis-associated pain in combination therapy with progestins.DOI: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000002640 PMID: 29794680
