Here,eribulin in combination with mechanistically different anticancer agents wasevaluated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eribulin was combined with cytotoxic agents (capecitabine,carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, gemcitabine) or targeted agents(bevacizumab, BKM-120, E7449, erlotinib, everolimus, lenvatinib, palbociclib) in tumor xenograft models of breast cancer, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), and ovarian cancer.RESULTS: Across nearly all models, eribulin with either cytotoxic or targetedagents demonstrated combination activity, defined as the activity demonstrablygreater than that of either agent alone. Combination activity was absent onlywith doxorubicin (MDA-MB-435 model) and with lenvatinib (NCI-H1975 model), bothof which responded to the agents as monotherapy.CONCLUSION: Eribulin has combination activity with multiple agents from differentmechanistic classes in several human cancer models, including breast, NSCLC,ovarian, and melanoma.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12604 PMID: 29848686  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
