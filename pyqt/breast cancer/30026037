Electronicaddress: tontos016@naver.com.PIN2/TERF1 interacting telomerase inhibitor 1 (PINX1) is a telomerase inhibitorlocated on human chromosome 8p23, and also act as a tumor suppressor in severaltypes of cancers, including breast, gastric, ovarian and bladder cancer; However,the role of PINX1 expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has not beendefined. Therefore, we investigated the role of PINX1 expression in PTC byanalyzing the correlation between PINX1 expression and variousclinicopathological factors. Immunohistochemistry for PINX1 was performed using atissue microarray of samples taken from the 160 patients with PTC. We alsoassessed mRNA and protein expression for PINX1 via quantitative real-timepolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis. Positivestaining for PINX1 was found in 16.3% of PTC cases. PINX1 expression wassignificantly associated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, telomerasereverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutation and recurrence. PINX1 mRNAexpression was more pronounced in the recurrent group than in the non-recurrentgroup. In addition, results of the binary logistic regression model showed thatPINX1 protein expression had a significant influence on recurrence. We concluded that PINX1 expression was associated with several clinicopathological factors,and had a significant influence on recurrence in patients with PTC. Therefore,PINX1 expression could be a useful prognostic marker in PTC patients.Copyright Â© 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.humpath.2018.07.004 PMID: 30026037
