An unexpectedinter- and intra-tumor metabolic heterogeneity has been strictly correlated totumor outcome. Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Protein 1 (TRAP1) is amolecular chaperone involved in the regulation of energetic metabolism in cancer cells. This protein is highly expressed in several cancers, such as glioblastoma,colon, breast, prostate and lung cancers and is often associated with drugresistance. However, TRAP1 is also downregulated in specific tumors, such asovarian, bladder and renal cancers, where its lower expression is correlated withthe worst prognoses and chemoresistance. TRAP1 is the only mitochondrial memberof the Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90) family that directly interacts withrespiratory complexes, contributing to their stability and activity but it isstill unclear if such interactions lead to reduced or increased respiratorycapacity. The role of TRAP1 is to enhance or suppress oxidative phosphorylation; the effects of such regulation on tumor development and progression arecontroversial. These observations encourage the study of the mechanismsresponsible for the dualist role of TRAP1 as an oncogene or oncosuppressor inspecific tumor types. In this review, TRAP1 puzzling functions were recapitulatedwith a special focus on the correlation between metabolic reprogramming and tumoroutcome. We wanted to investigate whether metabolism-targeting drugs canefficiently interfere with tumor progression and whether they might be combinedwith chemotherapeutics or molecular-targeted agents to counteract drug resistanceand reduce therapeutic failure.DOI: 10.3390/genes9040195 PMCID: PMC5924537PMID: 29621137
