Recently, the synthesis and initial evaluation of two high-potentialradiolabelled irreversible TG2 inhibitors were reported by us. In the presentstudy, these two compounds were evaluated further in a breast cancer (MDA-MB-231)tumour xenograft model for imaging active tissue transglutaminase in vivo.RESULTS: The metabolic stability of [11C]1 and [18F]2 in SCID mice was comparableto the previously reported stability in Wistar rats. Quantitative real-timepolymerase chain reaction analysis on MDA-MB-231 cells and isolated tumoursshowed a high level of TG2 expression with very low expression of othertransglutaminases. PET imaging showed low tumour uptake of [11C]1 (approx. 0.5percentage of the injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at 40-60 min p.i.) and withrelatively fast washout. Tumour uptake for [18F]2 was steadily increasing overtime (approx. 1.7 %ID/g at 40-60 min p.i.). Pretreatment of the animals with the TG2 inhibitor ERW1041E resulted in lower tumour activity concentrations, and thisinhibitory effect was enhanced using unlabelled 2.CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the TG2 targeting potential of [11C]1 in this model seemsinadequate, targeting of TG2 using [18F]2 was achieved. As such, [18F]2 could be used in future studies to clarify the role of active tissue transglutaminase indisease.DOI: 10.1186/s13550-018-0388-2 PMCID: PMC5970127PMID: 29802556
