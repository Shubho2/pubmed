Comparing 2 with its 1:1 mixture with 1 (IC50 = 1.70 and 7.18 μg/mL for HT-29 and HCT-116,respectively) and 1:2 mixture with 1 (0.74 and 3.46 μg/mL for HT-29 and HCT-116, respectively), 2 also showed strong cytotoxic potential against HT-29 and HCT-116(0.89 and 2.33 μg/mL, respectively). Unlike the mixtures which exhibited loweffects on MCF-7 (IC50 = 20.75 and 30.06 μg/mL for 1:1 and 1:2, respectively), 2 showed moderate activity against MCF-7 (10.99 μg/mL). Compound 6 showed thehighest cytotoxicity against HCT-116 (IC50 = 4.07 μg/mL).Conclusion: Mixtures of 1 and 2 (1:1 and 1:2), 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 from the CH2 Cl2extracts of the leaves and twigs of W. pubescens (R.Br.) exhibited varyingcytotoxic activities. All the compounds except 6 exhibited the strongestcytotoxic effects against HT-29. On the other hand, 6 was most cytotoxic against HCT-116. Overall, the toxicities of 1-6 were highest against HT-29, followed byHCT-116 and MCF-7. All the compounds showed varying activities against HDFn (IC50< 30 μg/mL).SUMMARY: Mixtures of ursolic acid (1) and oleanolic acid (2) (1:1 and 1:2),oleanolic acid (2), squalene (3), chlorophyll a (4), wrightiadione (5), andα-amyrin acetate (6), isolated from the dichloromethane extracts of the leavesand twigs of Wrightia pubescens (R.Br.), showed varying cytotoxic activitiesagainst three human cancer cell lines, breast (MCF-7) and colon (HT-29 andHCT-116), and a normal cell line, human dermal fibroblast-neonatal (HDFn), asevaluated using the PrestoBlue® cell viability assay.Abbreviation Used: IC50:Half maximal inhibitory concentration.DOI: 10.4103/pr.pr_45_17 PMCID: PMC5855380PMID: 29568181
