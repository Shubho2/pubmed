In 22 patients with unilateral breast cancer, theaverage VBP counts to a depth of 7 mm below the skin surface were significantlygreater in breasts with cancer than in the contralateral unaffected breasts(p < 0.01). The ratio of the VBP count in the breasts with cancer to that in the contralateral breasts was significantly increased in patients with a highhistologic grade (p = 0.03), those with estrogen receptor-negative disease(p < 0.01), and those with highly proliferative disease (p < 0.01). Thesepreliminary findings indicate that a higher number of VBPs in the superficialsubcutaneous layer of the breast might be a biomarker for primary breast cancer.DOI: 10.1016/j.pacs.2018.06.002 PMCID: PMC6039965PMID: 30003041
