China.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause ofcancer death in females worldwide. Chemoresistance has been a major reason forthe drug therapy failure. The present study performed a microarray analysisbetween MCF‑7 and MCF‑7/adriamycin (ADR) cells, and intended to identify longnon‑coding (lnc)RNA expression character in drug resistant breast cancer cells.MCF‑7/ADR cells were induced from MCF‑7 cells via pulse‑selection withdoxorubicin for 4 weeks, and the resistance to doxorubicin of ADR cells wasconfirmed by MTT assay. Microarray analysis was performed between MCF‑7 andMCF‑7/ADR cells. Total RNA was extracted from the two cell lines respectively andwas transcribed into cDNA. The results of the microarray were verified by reversetranscription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). Gene Ontology(GO) and pathways analysis were conducted to enrich the dysregulated lncRNAspresented in the microarray results. Compared to the MCF‑7 cells, 8,892 lncRNAswere differentially expressed in MCF/ADR cells (absolute fold‑change >2.0). Atotal of 32 lncRNAs were selected for RT‑qPCR by fold‑change filtering, standard Student's t‑test, and multiple hypothesis testing. Among the dysregulatedlncRNAs, AX747207 was prominent because its associated gene RUNX3 was previously reported to be relative to malignant tumor chemoresistance. GO analysis resultsalso indicated some biological processes and molecular functions linked tochemoresistance. The pathway enrichment results provided some potential pathways associated with chemoresistance. In the present study, the authors intended toidentify lncRNA expression character in drug resistant cell line MCF‑7/ADR,corresponding to the parental MCF‑7 cell line. In addition, the study identified the lncRNA AX747207, and its potential targeted gene RUNX3, may be related tochemoresistance in breast cancer. These results may new insights into exploringthe mechanisms of chemoresistance in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8942 PMCID: PMC6059676PMID: 29749447
