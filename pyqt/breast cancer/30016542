Protein expressions offour cytochrome P450 (Cyps) (Cyp3a11, 2d22, 2e1, and 1a2), threeUDP-glucuronosyltransferases (Ugts) (Ugt1a1, 1a6a, and 1a9) in liver microsomesof wild-type and Bcrp1-/- FVB mice at different ages were determined using avalidated ultra high performance liquid chromatography with tandem massspectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method. Activities and mRNA levels of these DMEs were measured using probe substrates method and real-time PCR, respectively. In theliver of wild-type FVB mice, Cyp3a11, 2d22, 2e1, 1a2, Ugt1a1, and 1a6a displayed the maximum protein levels at 6 to 9 weeks of age. Cyp1a2, Ugt1a1, 1a6a, and 1a9 showed the maximum activities at 6 to 9 weeks of age, whereas Cyp3a11, 2d22, and 2e1 showed the maximum activities in 1- to 3-week-old mice. Additionally, most ofDMEs showed the maximum mRNA levels in 17-week-old mice liver. Compared withwild-type FVB mice, the protein levels of these DMEs showed no significantchanges in Bcrp1-/- FVB mice liver. However, the activity of Cyp2e1 was increasedand that of Cyp2d22 was decreased. In conclusion, the seven hepatic DMEs in FVBmice liver showed significant alterations in an isoform-specific manner withincreased age. Although the protein levels of these DMEs showed no significantchanges, the activities of Cyp2e1 and 2d22 were changed in Bcrp1-/- mice.This article is protected by copyright.
