Electronic address: jungspil@korea.ac.kr.Axillary nodal status is one of the most important prognostic factors in breastcancer. The lymph node ratio (LNR) has been suggested as an independentprognostic factor because the number of dissected and involved lymph nodes might differ across institutions. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been the preferredtreatment method for reducing tumor mass in the breast and axillary area.However, NAC can reduce total number of excised lymph nodes compared with upfrontsurgery. Therefore, an emerging question is whether axillary nodal status and LNRfollowing NAC can accurately predict prognosis. We evaluated the prognostic valueof axillary nodal status and LNR after NAC. A total of 236 patients wereenrolled. Patients were divided into four groups according to the followingcut-off values for LNR: 0 (n = 107), 0.01-0.20 (n = 68), 0.21-0.65 (n = 50) and>0.65 (n = 11). Pathologic complete responses were observed in 16.9% of theoverall cohort. In univariate analysis, pathologic N stage was a significantprognostic factor of disease free survival (DFS, p = 0.013) and overall survival (OS, p = 0.004). However, in multivariate analysis, hormone receptor status(p = 0.043) and LNR (p = 0.028) were significantly associated with DFS and LNR(p = 0.017) showed statistical significance for OS; however, pathologic N stagewas no longer significantly associated with DFS or OS. Traditional nodal staging has been accepted as an important prognostic factor; however, our resultindicated that the nodal ratio could be an alternative to pN staging as aprognostic factor after NAC in breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Kaohsiung Medical University.
