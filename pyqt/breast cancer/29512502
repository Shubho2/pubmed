All the first ("prior")sets of mammograms were interpreted as negative during the original reading. Inthe sequential ("current") screening, 202 were proved positive and 190 remainednegative/benign. For each pair of the "prior" ipsilateral mammograms, weadaptively fused the image features computed from two views. Using four differenttypes of image features, we built four elastic net support vector machine (EnSVM)based classifiers. Then, the initial prediction scores form the 4 EnSVMs werecombined to build a final artificial neural network (ANN) classifier thatproduces the final risk prediction score. The performance of the new scheme wasevaluated by using a 10-fold cross-validation method and an assessment index ofthe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).RESULTS: A total number of 466 features were initially extracted from each pairof ipsilateral mammograms. Among them, 51 were selected to build the EnSVM based prediction scheme. The AUC = 0.737 ± 0.052 was yielded using the new scheme.Applying an optimal operating threshold, the prediction sensitivity was 60.4%(122 of 202) and the specificity was 79.0% (150 of 190).CONCLUSION: The study results showed moderately high positive association betweencomputed risk scores using the "prior" negative mammograms and the actual outcomeof the image-detectable breast cancers in the next subsequent screeningexaminations. The study also demonstrated that quantitative analysis of theipsilateral views of the mammograms enabled to provide useful information inpredicting near-term breast cancer risk.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
