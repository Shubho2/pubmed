Although considerable experimental evidence suggests that BPA is anendocrine-disrupting chemical, the toxicological profile of BPAF has beeninvestigated in less detail than that of BPA, even at the in vitro level. BPAFhas been established as an activator of estrogen receptor α (ERα) in many celllines; however, controversy surrounds its effects on the other isoform, ERβ(i.e., whether it functions as a stimulator). Five human ERβ isoforms have beencloned and characterized. Of these, we focused on the interactions between BPAFand the two isoforms, ERβ1 and ERβ2. We demonstrated that i) BPAF functioned as astimulator of ERβ1 (and ERα), which is transiently expressed in the two types of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cells) (EC50 values for ERβ:6.87 nM and 2.58 nM, respectively, and EC50 values for ERα: 24.7 nM and 181 nM,respectively), ii) the stimulation of ERβ1 by BPAF (1-25 nM) was abrogated byPHTPP (an ERβ selective antagonist), and iii) the expression of ERβ1 and ERβ2 wasnot modulated by BPAF at nanomolar concentrations up to 25 nM. These resultsindicate that BPAF activates not only human ERα, but also the ERβ1 isoform inbreast cancer cells, and exhibits higher activation potency for ERβ1.DOI: 10.2131/jts.43.321 PMID: 29743443  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
