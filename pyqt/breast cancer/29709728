Whole-body magneticresonance imaging (WB-MRI) identifies PD earlier than CT.METHODS: Thirty-one patients receiving first-line systemic anti-cancer therapy(SACT) were studied. Data were obtained from original WB-MRI reports.RESULTS: First PD was reported at metastatic sites only in 77.4%, and at localand metastatic sites concurrently in 22.6%. None had first PD only in localdisease, or clinical PD before PD on WB-MRI.CONCLUSION: Clinical evidence of SACT benefit in local disease may give falsereassurance about disease at metastatic sites.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
