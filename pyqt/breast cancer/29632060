Cost-of-care estimates are key inputs for comparative effectiveness and economic analyses that aim to inform policies associated with cancer care. Existingestimates are based largely on SEER-Medicare data in the elderly, leaving aknowledge gap regarding costs for patients aged <65 years. Methods: We estimated total and net medical care costs using data on individuals diagnosed with breast,colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer (n=45,522) and noncancer controls(n=314,887) enrolled in 1 of 4 participating health plans. Net costs were definedas the difference in mean total costs between patients with cancer and controls. The phase-of-care approach and Kaplan-Meier Sample Average method were used toestimate mean total and net 1- and 5-year costs (in 2015 US dollars) by cancersite, stage at diagnosis, and age group (<65 and ≥65 years). Results: Total andnet costs were consistently highest for lung cancer and lowest for prostatecancer. Net costs were higher across all cancer sites for patients aged <65 yearsthan those aged ≥65 years. Medical care costs for all cancers increased withadvanced stage at diagnosis. Conclusions: This study improves understanding ofmedical care costs for the 4 most common invasive cancers in the United States.Higher costs among patients aged <65 years highlight limitations of relying onSEER-Medicare data alone to understand the national burden of cancer, whereashigher costs for patients with advanced-stage cancer underscore the importance ofearly detection to curtail high long-term costs. These cost estimates can be usedin the development and evaluation of interventions and policies across the cancercare continuum.Copyright © 2018 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.DOI: 10.6004/jnccn.2017.7065 PMID: 29632060
