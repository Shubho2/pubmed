A prevailing approach to detectingdifferentially co-expressed genes is to compare Pearson's correlationcoefficients in two phenotypes. However, due to the limitations of Pearson'scorrelation measure, this approach lacks the power to detect nonlinear changes ingene co-expression which is common in gene regulatory networks.RESULTS: In this work, a new nonparametric procedure is proposed to searchdifferentially co-expressed gene pairs in different phenotypes from large-scaledata. Our computational pipeline consisted of two main steps, a screening stepand a testing step. The screening step is to reduce the search space by filteringout all the independent gene pairs using distance correlation measure. In thetesting step, we compare the gene co-expression patterns in different phenotypes by a recently developed edge-count test. Both steps are distribution-free andtargeting nonlinear relations. We illustrate the promise of the new approach byanalyzing the Cancer Genome Atlas data and the METABRIC data for breast cancersubtypes.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with some existing methods, the new method is more powerfulin detecting nonlinear type of differential co-expressions. The distancecorrelation screening can greatly improve computational efficiency, facilitating its application to large data sets.DOI: 10.1186/s12918-018-0582-x PMCID: PMC5956795PMID: 29769129
