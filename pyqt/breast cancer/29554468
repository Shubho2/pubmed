The objective of this study was to compare the observed Age trialresults with the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET)breast cancer model predicted results.METHODS: Five established CISNET breast cancer models used data on populationdemographics, screening attendance, and mammography performance from the Agetrial together with extant natural history parameters to project breast cancerincidence and mortality in the control and intervention arm of the trial.RESULTS: The models closely reproduced the effect of annual screening from ages40 to 49 years on breast cancer incidence. Restricted to breast cancer deathsoriginating from cancers diagnosed during the intervention phase, the modelsestimated an average 15% (range across models, 13% to 17%) breast cancermortality reduction at the 10-year follow-up compared with 25% (95% CI, 3% to42%) observed in the trial. At the 17-year follow-up, the models predicted 13%(range, 10% to 17%) reduction in breast cancer mortality compared with thenon-significant 12% (95% CI, -4% to 26%) in the trial.CONCLUSIONS: The models underestimated the effect of screening on breast cancermortality at the 10-year follow-up. Overall, the models captured the observedlong-term effect of screening from age 40 to 49 years on breast cancer incidence and mortality in the UK Age trial, suggesting that the model structures, inputparameters, and assumptions about breast cancer natural history are reasonablefor estimating the impact of screening on mortality in this age group.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X17718168 PMCID: PMC5862071 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29554468
