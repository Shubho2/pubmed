[Epub ahead of print]Uncovering the Invisible Patient Work System through a Case Study of BreastCancer Self-Management.Gorman RK(1), Wellbeloved-Stone CA(1), Valdez RS(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Public Health Sciences , University of Virginia ,Charlottesville , VA.As patients transition from passive recipients to actors in their healthmanagement, there is an opportunity to enhance theoretical frameworks describing the patient work system. Previous macroergonomic frameworks depict how patientsmanage health outside the institutional healthcare system, though none formallyintegrate the concept of invisible work - self-management practices undervaluedor unseen by healthcare providers. This paper overlays invisible work onto thepatient work system through a case study of breast cancer self-management. Thirtybreast cancer survivors were interviewed about positive and negative experiences post diagnosis. Invisible and visible components of participants' work systemswere explicated through qualitative content analysis. The results demonstratethat all participants had invisible work system components and that across allparticipants each work system component had invisible and visiblecharacteristics. Future research and design to support self-management practices should explicitly address the invisible characteristics of the work systems inwhich patients are embedded.DOI: 10.1080/00140139.2018.1503339 PMID: 30044709
