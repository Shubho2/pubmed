Epub 2017 Sep 12.Long Term Follow Up of Male Breast Cancer.McKinley N(1), McCain S(1), Kirk S(1).Author information: (1)South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.Introduction: Male breast cancer accounts for less than 1% of breast cancers withpublished overall and disease free survival being lower than in females.Aims: To determine treatment and long term outcomes for male breast cancerpatients in our unit.Methods: A database has been maintained for all breast cancer patients diagnosed in our unit since 1993. Patients were identified using the database andinformation was collated on patient demographics, tumour pathology, treatment andoutcomes using the database and retrospective chart review. Patients werefollowed to cause of death.Results: From 1994-2009 twenty-four cancers were diagnosed in twenty-twopatients. Mean age at diagnosis was 69. Male breast cancer patients were treated using similar principles to female breast cancer. Twenty patients underwentmastectomy, two patients underwent wide local excision. No patients developedlocal recurrence. One patient died from their breast cancer with systemicmetastases. 10-year overall survival was 22%, 10 year disease-specific survivalwas 80%. Other causes of death included medical co-morbidity and secondarycancers.Discussion: Disease free survival in our unit is comparable to other publishedstudies. High age at diagnosis and co-morbidity are the most important factors indetermining overall outcome. Treatment pathways for male breast cancer shouldfollow guidelines for female disease in order to optimise outcomes. Futureresearch at national or international level is necessary to ensure the mosteffective treatments are implemented for male breast cancer patients.PMCID: PMC5849974PMID: 29581629
