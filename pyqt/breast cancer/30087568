However, the direct comparison of theirefficacy and side effects has not been adequately reported. This study aimed tocompare the efficacy and toxicity of PLD and epirubicin as neoadjuvantchemotherapy for invasive breast cancer.Patients and methods: Women (n = 43) with invasive breast cancer who receivedneoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens containing PLD (PLD group) wereanalyzed and 1:2 matched with those (n = 86) who received regimens containingepirubicin (epirubicin group) according to clinical TNM staging and taxanecombination.Results: The PLD group achieved similar clinical response rate in neoadjuvantchemotherapy compared to the epirubicin group (76.7% vs 75.6%). The PLD group hada lower rate of grade 3 & 4 neutropenia (30.2% vs 60.5%), vomiting (7.0% vs28.0%), and grade 3 & 4 alopecia (9.3% vs 43.0%), yet a higher rate of mouthulceration (46.5% vs 11.7%). For the cardiac toxicity, the PLD group had asignificantly lower rate of ventricular premature beat compared with theepirubicin group (7.0% vs 20.9%, p = 0.043), and cardiac ultrasonographymonitoring showed non-significantly less PLD group patients' left ventricularejection fraction decline more than 10% compared with the epirubicin group (4.7% vs 8.1%, p = 0.463).Conclusion: In neoadjuvant chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer, PLD provides potentially similar efficacy and relatively less toxicity compared to epirubicin.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S162003 PMCID: PMC6061676PMID: 30087568
