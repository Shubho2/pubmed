One gene target ofERα, growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1), is associated withproliferation and regulation of ERα activity in estrogen-responsive breast cancercells. The GREB1 gene encodes three distinct isoforms: GREB1a, GREB1b and GREB1c,whose molecular functions are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role ofthese isoforms in regulation of ERα activity and proliferation. Interactionbetween GREB1 and ERα was mapped to the amino terminus shared by all GREB1variants. Analysis of isoform-specific regulation of ERα activity suggests noneof the GREB1 isoforms possess potent co-regulator activity. Exogenous expression of GREB1a resulted in elevated expression of some ER-target genes, independent ofERα activity. Despite this slight specificity of GREB1a for gene regulation,exogenous expression of either GREB1a or GREB1b resulted in decreasedproliferation in both ER-positive and ER-negative breast carcinoma cell lines,demonstrating an ER-independent function of GREB1. Interestingly, we show anincrease in the expression of GREB1b and GREB1c mRNA in malignant breast tissuecompared to normal patient samples, suggesting a selective preference for theseisoforms during malignant transformation. Together, these data suggest GREB1a hasan isoform-specific function as a transcriptional regulator while all isoformsshare an ER-independent activity that regulates proliferation.© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-17-0496 PMID: 29695586
