Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.(3)Department of Behavioral Sciences and Health Education, Emory University,Atlanta, GA, USA.Interventions offering peer mentoring programmes promoting moderate-to-vigorousphysical activity (MVPA) have shown improvements in MVPA and well-being frombaseline; however, research is limited. The purpose of this study was to compare the physical activity (PA) levels and psychosocial well-being of coaches andparticipants at baseline and following a 12-week intervention. Breast cancersurvivors (<5 years) were recruited and randomised into either exercise(Reach-to-Recovery (RTR) + PA) or control (RTR Control). Participants in bothgroups were individually assigned one of the 18 available coaches who deliveredeither the MVPA intervention or the control condition via telephone. PA (7-Day PARecall), psychosocial well-being, fatigue and mood were assessed at baseline and intervention completion. Seventy-six breast cancer survivors (average age = 55.62(±9.55)) were randomised. At baseline, all participants showed significantlylower MVPA (p = .001) and well-being (p < .05) as compared to coaches. However,post-intervention showed significant improvement in PA and well-being inRTR + PA, so that they were no longer significantly different from the coaches.Post-intervention, MVPA (p < .01), quality of life (p < .05) and fatigue(p < .05) remained significantly lower in RTR Controls compared to coaches.Future interventions should consider the behavioural patterns not only of theparticipants, but also of those who deliver the interventions.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ecc.12849 PMCID: PMC6084778 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29637645
