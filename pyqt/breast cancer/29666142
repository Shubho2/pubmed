There is clear benefit from chemotherapy in differentbreast cancer settings; however, knowledge of the mutations and genes thatmediate resistance is incomplete. In this study, by modeling chemoresistance inpatient-derived xenografts (PDXs), we show that adaptation to therapy isgenetically complex and identify that loss of transcription factor 4 (TCF4; also known as ITF2) is associated with this process. A triple-negative BRCA1-mutatedPDX was used to study the genetics of chemoresistance. The PDX was treated inparallel with four chemotherapies for five iterative cycles. Exome sequencingidentified few genes with de novo or enriched mutations in common among thedifferent therapies, whereas many common depleted mutations/genes were observed. Analysis of somatic mutations from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) supported theprognostic relevance of the identified genes. A mutation in TCF4 was found denovo in all treatments, and analysis of drug sensitivity profiles across cancercell lines supported the link to chemoresistance. Loss of TCF4 conferredchemoresistance in breast cancer cell models, possibly by altering cell cycleregulation. Targeted sequencing in chemoresistant tumors identified an intronicvariant of TCF4 that may represent an expression quantitative trait locusassociated with relapse outcome in TCGA. Immunohistochemical studies suggest acommon loss of nuclear TCF4 expression post-chemotherapy. Together, these resultsfrom tumor xenograft modeling depict a link between altered TCF4 expression andbreast cancer chemoresistance.© 2018.
