Epub 2018 Apr 6.A dietary pattern based on estrogen metabolism is associated with breast cancerrisk in a prospective cohort of postmenopausal women.Guinter MA(1)(2), McLain AC(2), Merchant AT(2), Sandler DP(3), Steck SE(2)(4).Author information: (1)Behavioral and Epidemiology Research Group, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA.(2)Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC.(3)Epidemiology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC.(4)Cancer Prevention and Control Program, University of South Carolina, Columbia,SC.Increased exposure to estrogen is a risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer,and dietary factors can influence estrogen metabolism. However, studies of dietand breast cancer have been inconclusive. We developed a dietary patternassociated with levels of unconjugated estradiol and the ratio of 2- and16-hydroxylated estrogen metabolites in a subsample of Prostate, Lung, Colorectaland Ovarian Screening Trial (PLCO) participants (n = 653) using reduced rankregression, and examined its association with postmenopausal breast cancerprospectively in the larger PLCO cohort (n = 27,488). The estrogen-relateddietary pattern (ERDP) was comprised of foods with positively-weighted intakes(non-whole/refined grains, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, cheese,fish/shellfish high in ω-3 fatty acids, franks/luncheon meats) andnegatively-weighted intakes (nuts/seeds, other vegetables, fish/shellfish low in ω-3 fatty acids, yogurt, coffee). A 1-unit increase in the ERDP score wasassociated with an increase in total (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18), invasive (HR:1.13; 95% CI: 1.04-1.24) and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (HR: 1.13, 95% CI:1.02-1.24) breast cancer risk after adjustment for confounders. Associations wereobserved for the fourth quartile of ERDP compared with the first quartile foroverall breast cancer (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.98-1.32), invasive cases (HR: 1.20,95% CI: 1.02-1.42) and ER-positive cases (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.99-1.41). Theincreased risk associated with increasing ERDP score was more apparent in strata of some effect modifiers (postmenopausal hormone therapy non-users and non-obese participants) where the relative estrogen exposure due to that factor was lowest,although the p values for interaction were not statistically significant. Resultssuggest a dietary pattern based on estrogen metabolism is positively associatedwith postmenopausal breast cancer risk, possibly through an estrogenic influence.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31387 PMCID: PMC6019153 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29574860
