While CRISPR/Cas9-mediated nullallele production in mice is highly efficient, generation of conditional alleles has proven to be more difficult. To test the feasibility of using CRISPR/Cas9gene editing to generate conditional knockout mice for this large-scale resource,we employed Cas9-initiated homology-driven repair (HDR) with short and longsingle stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs and lssDNAs).RESULTS: Using pairs of single guide RNAs and short ssODNs to introduce loxPsites around a critical exon or exons, we obtained putative conditional allelefounder mice, harboring both loxP sites, for 23 out of 30 targeted genes. LoxPsites integrated in cis in at least one mouse for 18 of 23 genes. However, loxPsites were mutagenized in 4 of the 18 in cis lines. HDR efficiency correlatedwith Cas9 cutting efficiency but was minimally influenced by ssODN homology armsymmetry. By contrast, using pairs of guides and single lssDNAs to introduceloxP-flanked exons, conditional allele founders were generated for all four genestargeted, although one founder was found to harbor undesired mutations within thelssDNA sequence interval. Importantly, when employing either ssODNs or lssDNAs,random integration events were detected.CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that Cas9-mediated HDR with pairs of ssODNs can generate conditional null alleles at many loci, but reveal inefficiencieswhen applied at scale. In contrast, lssDNAs are amenable to high-throughputproduction of conditional alleles when they can be employed. Regardless of thesingle-stranded donor utilized, it is essential to screen for sequence errors at sites of HDR and random insertion of donor sequences into the genome.DOI: 10.1186/s12915-018-0529-0 PMCID: PMC6011517PMID: 29925370
