Approximately 90% of paclitaxel hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) occur within the first 10 to 15 min of the first two infusions. Weinvestigated the feasibility of dexamethasone withdrawal between weeks 3 and 12(W3 and W12) in early stage breast cancer patients treated with weekly paclitaxelat the standard dose (80 mg/m2).METHODS: All patients received intravenous prophylaxis of dexamethasone 20 mg,ranitidine 50 mg, and diphenhydramine 50 mg in the first 2 weeks (W1 and W2) oftreatment. Provided that no serious (G3/G4) HSRs events occurred, dexamethasonewas omitted between W3 and W12, while ranitidine and diphenhydramine werecontinued. The primary end point was the incidence of any grade HSRs during thetreatment period, and the secondary end points were quality of life and weightchanges.RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were included in the study, and 300 infusion cyclesof paclitaxel were evaluated for HSRs. The overall incidence of HSRs was 0.6% (2 events), and both of these events occurred in the first week. There were noincidents of serious HSRs or anaphylaxis and no G3 or G4 toxicities. Scores from the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire did not change significantly for the globalhealth status/quality of life scale or for the symptoms scales, although changes in scores differed significantly for the functional scales. There were noclinically relevant weight changes during the treatment period.CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone withdrawal from W3 to W12 in early stage breast cancerpatients treated with weekly paclitaxel is feasible. The incidence of all grades of HSRs was comparable to that reported in trials with dexamethasone for 12consecutive weeks, and no serious events (G3/G4) occurred. Studies with largersample sizes are needed to confirm our results which are important, especiallyfor patients for whom corticosteroids are contraindicated.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4381-0 PMID: 30069696
