This work, a novel and sensitivelabel-free immunoassay based on gold nanospear (Au NSs) electrochemicallyassembled onto thiolated graphene quantum dots (CysA/GQDs) for the detection ofCA 15-3 antibodies. The CysA/Au NSs/GQDs hybrid interface provides a largesurface area for the effective immobilization of CA 15-3 antigens, as well as it ascertains the bioactivity and stability of immobilized CA 15-3 antigens. Fieldemission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), and EDS photoelectronspectroscopies were used to monitor the sensor fabrication. Also, cyclicvoltammetry was used to quantify the extent of Au NSs' surface coverage by CA15-3 antigens. Square wave voltammetry (SWV) was employed to investigate theimmunosensor fabrication and to monitor the binding events between CA 15-3antigens-antibodies. Under optimized experimental conditions, the immunosensordisplayed good sensitivity and specificity. The CA 15-3 were detected in aconcentration as low as 0.11U/mL with a linear range from 0.16-125U/mL. The high sensitivity of the immunosensor may derive from the high loading of CA 15-3antibodies on CysA/Au NSs/GQDs hybrid interface which increases the number ofbinding events. The method was successfully applied assay of the CA 15-3 inunprocessed human plasma samples. Also, proposed immunosensor was applied to the assay of CA 15-3 malignant cell line lysates (human breast adenocarcinoma cellline-MCF-7).Copyright Â© 2018.
