Peak oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) is the gold standard forassessing cardiorespiratory fitness and is inversely correlated withcardiovascular disease among women with breast cancer. Some previous studies havereported that aerobic exercise and proper diet positively influence [Formula: seetext]. However, almost all studies have been conducted in the Western countries, and few studies are investigating on Asian women who have lower BMI compared withWestern ones.PURPOSE: Investigating the effects of a combined exercise and diet program among Japanese cancer patients undergoing therapy on [Formula: see text].METHODS: Thirty-two Japanese women with breast cancer undergoing endocrinetherapy (age; 50 ± 6 years, body weight; 59 ± 10 kg) were voluntarily assigned toeither intervention group (n = 21) or control group (n = 11). The interventiongroup completed a 12-week combined exercise plus diet program, consisting ofweekly aerobic exercise and maintaining a nutritionally well-balanced1200 kcal/day diet. The control group was instructed to continue with their usualactivities. Anthropometric indices and [Formula: see text] were measured atbaseline and after the 12-week program.RESULTS: All 21 women completed the 12-week program. The [Formula: see text]significantly increased from 26.7 to 30.4 mL/kg/min (1.57-1.62 L/min) in theintervention group, while it remained unchanged (26.9-26.9 mL/kg/min) in thecontrol group. Mean reduction of body mass index was - 2.1 in the interventiongroup (P < .001) and + 0.1 in the control group.CONCLUSIONS: Our combined exercise plus diet program may contribute toimprovement in cardiorespiratory fitness and body weight compared with controlgroup.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0889-x PMID: 29992486
