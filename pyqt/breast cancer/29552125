China.Over the past three decades, numerous patients with breast cancer succumbed tocancer metastasis and recurrence, while, the exact mechanisms underlying thismalignancy, and the potential biomarkers for prognosis prediction remain elusive.It was previously demonstrated that phosphorylated RAC-Î± serine/threonine-proteinkinase (pAkt) and Beclin 1 was associated with cancer metastasis, and recurrence.Thus far, the expression patterns of pAkt and Beclin 1 in breast cancer tissues, and their associations with the prognosis of invasive ductal breast cancer remaininconclusive, which may be due to various factors, including ethnicity andpathological types. In the present study, a total of 90 Chinese female patientswith invasive ductal breast cancer between June 1999 and August 2002 wereenrolled at Shanghai First People's Hospital (Shanghai, China). The patients werefollowed up from 5 months to 13.5 years for survival analysis. The expressionallevels of pAkt and Beclin 1 in invasive ductal breast cancer tissues, and thenormal paracancerous tissues were measured by immunohistochemistry. Associations with prognosis following surgery were further evaluated using Cox regressionanalysis. In 90 invasive ductal breast cancer samples, pAkt was detected in 17(18.9%) samples and Beclin 1 in 33 (36.7%) samples, but both were not detected inany of the paracancerous samples. Survival analysis revealed that pAkt expressioncarried a tendency to predict a shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in patientswith invasive ductal breast cancer. Additionally, Beclin 1 expression was notsignificantly associated with survival. Furthermore, univariate Cox regressionanalysis demonstrated that pAkt expression was negatively associated with DFS andoverall survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that pAktexpression was an independent risk factor associated with poor prognosis inpatients with invasive ductal breast cancer (all P<0.05). pAkt may be used as apotential prognostic biomarker in Chinese women with invasive ductal breastcancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7965 PMCID: PMC5840663PMID: 29552125
