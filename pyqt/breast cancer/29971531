Molecular subtypes were classified as luminal A (hormone receptor [HR]+/human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 [HER2]-), luminal B (HR+/HER2+), HER2 (HR-/HER2+), or triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (HR-/HER2-). The incidence and prognosis of brain metastasiswas evaluated according to molecular subtype.RESULTS: Among the 206913 breast cancer patients, the HER2 subtype showed thehighest incidence of brain metastasis (1.0%). HER2 and TNBC with multipleextracranial metastases (bone, liver, and lung) showed a high incidence of brain metastasis (28.0 and 30.8%, respectively). Median survival of luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and TNBC in brain metastasis was 12, 23, 10, and 6 months (p < 0.001),and in brain metastasis without visceral metastasis was 14, 34, 17, and 8 months (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the order of subtype by favorableprognosis was luminal B, luminal A, HER2, and TNBC in all brain metastasis, whilefor brain metastasis patients without visceral metastasis, the order was luminal B, HER2, luminal A, and TNBC.CONCLUSIONS: Molecular subtype and visceral metastasis should be considered forprediction of prognosis for patients with brain metastasis. The patients withHER2 and TNBC cancer subtypes having visceral metastasis, close surveillancecould contribute to early detection of brain metastasis and may putatively leadto improved quality of life and survival.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2697-2 PMID: 29971531  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
