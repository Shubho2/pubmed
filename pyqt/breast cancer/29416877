Here, we report onthe diagnostic and therapeutic properties of IDK1, an antibody against tumourassociated, hypoglycosylated bone sialoprotein (hypo-BSP). The affinity of therat monoclonal antibody IDK1 for hypo-BSP, as determined by microscalethermophoresis, was three orders of magnitude higher than for mature BSP, whereasthe mouse monoclonal antibody used had similar affinity for both BSP forms. IDK1 showed no activity against the proliferation or migration of normal or cancercells growing in vitro. In vivo, however, IDK1 caused dose-dependent regressionof soft tissue and skeletal lesions in nude rats harbouring human MDA-MB-231cells. At optimal dose, 80% of the treated rats showed complete remission of all tumour lesions. Analysis of BSP expression in vitro by fluorescence-activatedcell sorting (FACS) and immunocytochemistry showed basal levels of this protein, which were visible only in a fraction of these cells. Cells of the metastaticcell lines MDA-MB-231 and PC-3 were more often positive for hypo-BSP. Inaddition, there was co-expression of both forms in some cells, but almost noco-localization; rather, hypo-BSP was present in the nucleus, and mature BSP was detected extra-cellularly. Normal osteoblasts and osteoclasts were negative forhypo-BSP. Breast cancer tissue, however, showed strong expression of mature BSP, which was present intra-cellularly as well as in vesicles outside cells. Hypo-BSPwas present mainly in lesions from skeletal sites, thus explaining theantineoplastic activity of IDK1, which was high in lesions growing in thevicinity of the skeleton but low in lesions growing subcutaneously. Finally,hypo-BSP was detected in specimens from breast cancer patients, with asignificantly greater intensity in skeletal metastases as compared to therespective primary cancers. In conclusion, IDK-1 is an antibody with diagnosticand therapeutic applications in skeletal metastases of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1002/cjp2.88 PMCID: PMC5783975PMID: 29416877
