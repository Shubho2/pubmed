Overall, 25.1% ± 29.7%, 8.32% ± 10.1%, and 16.37% ±17.5% of cancer cells in the tumors studied were positive for B-tub, TOP2A, and TIMP-1expressions, respectively. However, positive molecule expression did not differbetween patients who did and did not exhibit clinical responses to treatment. Theproportion of TOP2A-positive cancer cells was significantly higher amonganthracycline responders than among nonresponders in HR-negative cancer (15.4%±17.5% vs. 2.0% ± 2.4%, respectively, P = 0.048), whereas TOP2A and TIMP-1expression statuses did not differ in HR-positive cancer. When patients werestratified according to B-tub, TOP2A, or TIMP-1 expression statuses (B-tub ≥10%vs. <10%, TOP2A ≥5% vs. <5%, TIMP-1 ≤20% vs. >20%, respectively), the proportion of patients with ≥10% B-tub-positive cancer cells was significantly higher intaxane responders than in nonresponders (72.4% vs. 37.5%, respectively, P =0.016). Anthracycline responders showed a trend to have a higher proportion ofpatients with either ≥5% TOP2A-positive cancer cells or ≤20% TIMP-1-positivecancer cells compared to nonresponders (86.7% vs. 61.5%, respectively, P =0.066).Conclusion: Immunohistochemical TOP2A, TIMP-1, and B-tub expression analyses are expected to be useful for predicting tumor responses to chemotherapy.DOI: 10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_1053_16 PMID: 29516929
