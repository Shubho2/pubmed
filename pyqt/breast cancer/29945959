[Epub ahead of print]FBXO22 possesses both pro-tumorigenic and anti-metastatic roles in breast cancer progression.Sun R(1), Xie HY(2), Qian JX(3), Huang YN(3), Yang F(3), Zhang FL(4), Shao ZM(5),Li DQ(6).Author information: (1)Institutes of biomedical sciences, Fudan University.(2)Shanghai Cancer Center and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, FudanUniversity.(3)Department of Breast Surgery, Fudan University.(4)Cancer Institute, Fudan University.(5)Department of Breast Surgery, Breast Cancer Institution, Cancer Hospital,FudanUniversity.(6)Cancer Institute and Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan Universitydaqiangli1974@fudan.edu.cn.The molecular underpinnings behind malignant progression of breast cancer from a localized lesion to an invasive and ultimately metastatic disease areincompletely understood. Here we report that F-box only protein 22 (FBXO22) playsa dual role in mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis. FBXO22 was upregulated inprimary breast tumors and promoted cell proliferation and colony formation invitro and xenograft tumorigenicity in vivo. Surprisingly, FBXO22 suppressedepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell motility, and invasiveness in vitroand metastatic lung colonization in vivo. Clinical data showed that expressionlevels of FBXO22 were associated with favorable clinical outcomes, supporting thenotion that metastasis, rather than primary cancer, is the major determinant ofthe mortality of breast cancer patients. Mechanistic investigations furtherrevealed that FBXO22 elicits its antimetastatic effects by targeting SNAIL, amaster regulator of EMT and breast cancer metastasis, for ubiquitin-mediatedproteasomal degradation in a glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)phosphorylation-dependent manner. Importantly, expression of SNAIL rescuedFBXO22-mediated suppression of EMT, cell migration, and invasion. Apatient-derived tryptophan-to-arginine mutation at residue 52 (W52R) within theF-box domain impaired FBXO22 binding to the SKP1-Cullin1 complex and blockedFBXO22-mediated SNAIL degradation, thus abrogating the ability of FBXO22 tosuppress cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Collectively, these findingsuncover an unexpected dual role for FBXO22 in mammary tumorigenesis andmetastatic progression and delineate the mechanism of an oncogenic mutation ofFBXO22 in breast cancer progression.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-3647 PMID: 29945959
