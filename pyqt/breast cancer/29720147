Cellular retinol binding protein-1(CRBP-1) as a carrier protein transports retinol from the liver storage site toperipheral tissue. Up-regulated expression of CRBP-1 is associated with sometumor types such as prostate cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer asreported, but its role in TSCC remains uncertain.METHODS: In this study, an integrated bioinformatics analysis based on themultiple cancer microarray data sets available from Oncomine database wasconducted to view the differential expression of CRBP-1 between TSCC and theadjacent non-tumorous tissues. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR), western blotting (WB) and immunohistochemical (IHC) assays wereperformed to investigate CRBP-1 expression in 101 paraffin-embeded TSCC tissuesand 48 pairs of freshly frozen tissues. Kaplan-Meier curve and univariate andmultivariate Cox-regression analysis were used to estimate the associationbetween CRBP-1 expression and patients' prognosis. Then western blotting, MTT,transwell migration and invasion assays were performed in TSCC cell lines toinvestigate the effects of CRBP-1 on cellular proliferation and invasion.RESULTS: Compared with the matched adjacent non-tumorous tissues, the expression of CRBP-1 was significantly up-regulated in TSCC tissues, which correlated withthe differentiation state (P = 0.003), N classification (P = 0.048), the clinicalstage (P = 0.048) and death (P = 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that TSCC patients with higher CRBP-1 expression levels had lower overall survival ratesthan those with lower CRBP-1 expression levels. A univariate and multivariateanalysis demonstrated that CRBP-1 was an independent prognostic factor(P < 0.05). Furthermore, we knocked down CRBP-1 expression and observed that TSCCcell proliferation and invasion in vitro were significantly blocked, asdetermined by MTT and transwell assays.CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulated expression of CRBP-1 is associated with poor prognosis in TSCC, so it might potentially serve as an additional prognostic marker, andthe inhibition of CRBP-1 might provide new therapeutic approaches for TSCC.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4249-1 PMCID: PMC5932876PMID: 29720147
