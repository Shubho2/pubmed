Content validity was supported. Internal consistency(α) for all questions was .98 and ranged for the different domains between 0.92and 0.97. Test-retest reliability for the total score was highly satisfactory,ICC = 0.95, standard error of measurement (SEM) = 4.5 and smallest detectablechange = 12.5. ICC values for the domains ranged from 0.84 to 0.94. SEM valuesdiffered for the domains, 6.4 (physical function), 5.7 (mobility activities),7.09 (life and social activities), 9.1 (mental functions), and 10.2 (householdactivities).CONCLUSION: The translated and adjusted Lymph-ICF DK (Denmark) is reliable andvalid, allowing for assessing self-reported impairments in function, activitylimitations, and participation restrictions in Danish patients with breastcancer-related arm lymphedema.DOI: 10.1080/09593985.2018.1443186 PMID: 29485298
