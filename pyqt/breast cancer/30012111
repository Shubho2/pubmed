AKT comprises three isoforms thatmediate critical non-redundant, even opposing functions in cancerpathophysiology. Therefore, targeting specific AKT isoforms in particular cancersmay be more effective than pan-AKT inhibition while avoiding disadvantages ofpan-AKT inhibition. Currently, AKT isoform-specific expression and activation in cancer are not clearly characterized.METHODS: We systematically characterized AKT isoform-specific expression andactivation in 211 cancer cell lines derived from different lineages and geneticbackgrounds using a reverse-phase protein array platform.RESULTS: We found that phosphorylation, but not expression, of AKT1 and AKT2 was coordinated in most but not all cells. Different cancer lineages displayeddifferential AKT1 and AKT2 expression and phosphorylation. A PIK3CA hotspotmutation H1047R but not E545K was associated with selective activation of AKT2but not AKT1.CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified and validated AKT isoform-specific expressionand phosphorylation in certain cell lines and demonstrated that genetic changescan affect AKT isoform-specific activation. These results provide a more precise understanding of AKT isoform-specific signaling and, in addition, facilitate AKT isoform targeting for personalized cancer therapies.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4654-5 PMCID: PMC6048698PMID: 30012111
