Wilmot Cancer Institute,Rochester, NY, USA.(5)Metro-Minnesota Community Oncology Research Consortium, Minneapolis, MN, USA.(6)Novant Health Oncology Specialists, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.BACKGROUND: This phase II RCT was conducted to determine the feasibility andacceptability of brief behavioral therapy for cancer-related insomnia (BBT-CI) inbreast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. We also assessed the preliminary effects of BBT-CI on insomnia and circadian rhythm in comparison to a HealthyEating Education Learning control condition (HEAL).METHODS: Of the 71 participants recruited, 34 were randomised to receive BBT-CIand 37 to receive HEAL. Oncology staff was trained to deliver the intervention infour community clinics affiliated with the NCI. Insomnia was assessed with theInsomnia Severity Index (ISI), and circadian rhythm was assessed using awrist-worn actiwatch.RESULTS: Community staff interveners delivered 72% of the interventioncomponents, with a recruitment rate of 77% and an adherence rate of 73%, meeting acceptability and feasibility benchmarks. Those randomised to BBT-CI improvedtheir ISI scores by 6.3 points compared to a 2.5-point improvement in thoserandomised to HEAL (P = 0.041). Actigraphy data indicated that circadianfunctioning improved in the BBT-CI arm as compared to the HEAL arm atpost-intervention (all P-values <0.05).CONCLUSIONS: BBT-CI is an acceptable and feasible intervention that can bedelivered directly in the community oncology setting by trained staff. The BBT-CIarm experienced significant improvements in insomnia and circadian rhythm ascompared to the control condition.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0154-2 PMID: 30026614
