Disagreement between the twoobservers was resolved by consensus.STATISTICAL TESTS: The parameters in benign and malignant lesions were comparedby Student's t-test. The diagnostic performances of DKI and quantitative DCE,either alone or in combination, were evaluated by receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) analysis. The Spearman correlation test was used to evaluatecorrelations among the diffusion parameters and perfusion parameters.RESULTS: MK, MD, ADC, Ktrans , and kep values were significantly differentbetween breast cancer and benign lesions (P < 0.05). MK from DKI demonstrated thehighest AUC of 0.849, which is significantly higher than ADC derived fromconventional DWI (z = 3.345, P = 0.0008). The specificity of DCE-MRI-derivedparameters was improved when combining diffusion parameters, such as ADC and MK. The highest diagnostic specificity (93.2%) was obtained when kep and ADC werecombined. kep was correlated moderately positively with MK (r = 0.516) andmoderately negatively with MD (r = -0.527). Ktrans was weakly positivelycorrelated with MK with an r of 0.398 and weakly negatively correlated with MDwith an r of -0.450.DATA CONCLUSION: DKI is more valuable than conventional DWI in distinguishingbetween benign and malignant breast lesions. DKI exhibits promise as aquantitative technique to augment quantitative DCE-MRI. Diffusion parametersderived from DKI were statistically correlated with perfusion parameters fromquantitative DCE-MRI.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. Magn. Reson.
