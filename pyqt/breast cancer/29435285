Of 53 consecutive patientswho underwent lung biopsies in two institutions (Hiroshima University Hospitaland Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan) between 1997 and 2014, 45underwent lung surgery and 8 underwent percutaneous or transbronchial tumorbiopsy for lung nodules developing after curative surgery for breast cancer. The indications for lung biopsy included lung nodules for which a definitivediagnosis was difficult to achieve, and those for which the treatment strategydepended on the pathological diagnosis. The lung nodules were pathologicallydiagnosed as primary breast cancer metastases to the lungs in 25 (47%), primarymalignant lung tumors in 21 (40%) and benign disease in 7 (13%) patients. Amongthe 25 metastatic patients confirmed by lung biopsy, phenotype discordance wasobserved in 6 patients (24%). A total of 3 patients with lung metastasis provento have estrogen or progesterone receptor upregulation by lung biopsy receivedendocrine therapy. Univariate analysis revealed that patients with metastaticbreast cancer confirmed by lung biopsy were significantly younger and had morelocally advanced primary cancers diagnosed via clinical and pathologicalassessment compared with patients with other diseases. Therefore, mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were performed more frequently in the metastasisgroup compared with the others group. Multivariate analysis revealed thatmastectomy (P<0.001) and axillary dissection (P<0.001) were independent factorspredicting that the lung nodules would be metastases from breast cancer. Lungbiopsy in breast cancer patients who developed lung nodules during the follow-up period after breast cancer surgery was crucial for making a definitive diagnosis and modifying the treatment strategy, which may improve the prognosis of breastcancer patients.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2017.1511 PMCID: PMC5774462PMID: 29435285
