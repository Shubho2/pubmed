Here, we show thatubiquitylation regulates RIPK1's cytotoxic potential not only via activation ofdownstream kinases and NF-kB transcriptional responses, but also by directlyrepressing RIPK1 kinase activity via ubiquitin-dependent inactivation. We findthat the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis(cIAP)1 is required for optimal ubiquitin-lysine occupancy and K48 ubiquitylationof RIPK1. Independently of IKK and MK2, cIAP1-mediated and UBA-assistedubiquitylation suppresses RIPK1 kinase auto-activation and, in addition, marks itfor proteasomal degradation. In the absence of a functional UBA domain of cIAP1, more active RIPK1 kinase accumulates in response to TNF, causing RIPK1kinase-mediated cell death and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Theseresults reveal a direct role for cIAP-mediated ubiquitylation in controllingRIPK1 kinase activity and preventing TNF-mediated cytotoxicity.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).
