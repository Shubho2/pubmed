We hypothesized that everolimus plus the selective ER downregulatorfulvestrant would be more efficacious than fulvestrant alone in ER-positivemetastatic breast cancer resistant to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. Patients and Methods This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II studyincluded 131 postmenopausal women with ER-positive, human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2-negative, AI-resistant metastatic breast cancer randomly assigned tofulvestrant (500 mg days 1 and 15 of cycle 1, then day 1 of cycles 2 and beyond) plus everolimus or placebo. The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a 70% improvement in median progression-free survival from 5.4 months to 9.2months. Secondary end points included objective response and clinical benefitrate (response or stable disease for at least 24 weeks). Prophylacticcorticosteroid mouth rinses were not used. Results The addition of everolimus to fulvestrant improved the median progression-free survival from 5.1 to 10.3 months(hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.92]; stratified log-rank P = .02),indicating that the primary trial end point was met. Objective response rateswere similar (18.2% v 12.3%; P = .47), but the clinical benefit rate wassignificantly higher in the everolimus arm (63.6% v 41.5%; P = .01). Adverseevents of all grades occurred more often in the everolimus arm, including oralmucositis (53% v 12%), fatigue (42% v 22%), rash (38% v 5%), anemia (31% v. 6%), diarrhea (23% v 8%), hyperglycemia (19% v 5%), hypertriglyceridemia (17% v 3%),and pneumonitis (17% v 0%), although grade 3 to 4 events were uncommon.Conclusion Everolimus enhances the efficacy of fulvestrant in AI-resistant,ER-positive metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.76.9331 PMID: 29664714
