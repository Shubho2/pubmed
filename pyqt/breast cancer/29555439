Electronic address: professorgxzhai@126.com.Paclitaxel (PTX) belongs to a class of taxane anti-tumor drug used for the clinictreatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and soon. PTX has poor water solubility and oral bioavailability. It is generallyadministered via intravenous (i.v.) infusion. Traditional PTX injectablepreparations contain Cremophor-EL and ethanol to improve its solubility, whichwould result in adverse reactions like severe hypersensitivity, neutropenia, etc.Adverse reactions can be reduced only by complicated pretreatment withglucocorticoid and antihistamines drugs and followed by PTX slow infusion forthree hours, which has brought significant inconvenience to the patients. Though,a new-generation PTX formulation, Abraxane, free of Cremophor-EL and ethanol, is still being administrated by frequent i.v. infusions and extremely expensive.Therefore, non-injection administration of PTX is urgently needed to avoid theside effects as well as reduce inconvenience to the patients. Recently, a varietyof non-injection drug delivery systems (DDSs) of PTX have been developed. Thisreview aims to discuss the progress of non-injectable administration systems ofPTX, including oral administration systems, vaginal administration systems,implantable DDSs, transdermal DDSs and intranasal administration for the futurestudy and clinical applications.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
