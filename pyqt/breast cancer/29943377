We compared the distributions ofthe observed values and the four sets of mapped values and performed regressionanalyses to assess whether the association with risk factors was preserved byutility values derived from mapping.RESULTS: At baseline, the observed EQ-5D-5L utility value had a mean ± standarddeviation (SD) of 0.820 ± 0.152, and 24.8% of the respondents attained a value of1. The OLS method (mean 0.820; SD 0.112; proportion 0%) better agreed with theobserved data than the equipercentile (mean 0.831; SD 0.152; proportion 23.5%),linear equating (mean 0.814; SD 0.145; proportion 11.8%) and mean rank method(mean 0.821; SD 0.147; proportion 23.9%). The significance of association waspreserved for all parameters involved in the regression analyses by theequipercentile and linear equating methods, but the mean rank and OLS methodswere inconsistent with the observed data for one and two parameters,respectively.CONCLUSION: The problem of shrinkage in the variance occurred in the OLS method, but it provided an unbiased estimate for the mean and better agreement. Among theother three linking methods, the mean rank method better described thedistribution, whereas the equipercentile and linear equating methods betterassessed the association with risk factors.DOI: 10.1007/s40258-018-0404-8 PMID: 29943377
