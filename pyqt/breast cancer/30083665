CoulterDepartment of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and EmoryUniversity School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.Photoacoustic imaging using exogenous contrast agents has emerged as a hybridtechnique that enables the deep imaging of optical properties of tissues withhigh spatial resolution. The power of this imaging technique can be greatlyenhanced by the use of contrast agents that absorb at near-infrared wavelengthsand whose optical properties can be modulated in response to the localenvironment. We have designed contrast agents consisting of gold nanoparticlescoated with anisotropic silica nanoshells. The tunable aggregation of these janusparticles in cell culture media resulted in a dramatic amplification ofphotoacoustic signals in the near-infrared region. We also demonstrated imagingusing these contrast agents in mammalian cells, including macrophages and breast cancer cells as well as in vivo. The ability to modulate janus particleaggregation in response to a range of stimuli in combination with the highresolution and deep penetration of multiwavelength photoacoustic imaging areattractive for a broad range of applications in diagnostic imaging andtheranostics.DOI: 10.1039/c8nr03973a PMID: 30083665
