Ubiquitous exposure to BPA has been linked toobesity, diabetes, and breast and reproductive system cancers. Resistance tochemotherapeutic agents has also been shown in cancer cell models. Here, weinvestigated BPA's ability to confer resistance to camptothecin (CPT) in mouseembryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). MEFs are sensitive to CPT; however, co-exposure of BPA with CPT improved cell survival. Co-exposure significantly reduced Top1-DNAadducts, decreasing chromosomal aberrations and DNA strand break formation. This decrease occurs despite BPA treatment increasing the protein levels of Top1. Byexamining chromatin structure after BPA exposure, we determined that widespreadcompaction and loss of nuclear volume occurs. Therefore, BPA reduced CPT activityby reducing the accessibility of DNA to Top1, inhibiting DNA adduct formation,the generation of toxic DNA strand breaks, and improving cell survival.DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.8b00050 PMID: 29799191
