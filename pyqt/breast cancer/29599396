[Epub ahead of print]Diagnostic concordance of reporting lymphovascular invasion in breast cancer.Rakha EA(1)(2), Abbas A(1), Pinto Ahumada P(3), ElSayed ME(4), Colman D(1),Pinder SE(5), Ellis IO(1).Author information: (1)Department of Histopathology, School of Medicine, Nottingham UniversityHospitals NHS Trust, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.(2)Histopathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University, ShabeenEl Kom, Egypt.(3)Hospital Clínico Magallanes, Punta Arenas, Chile.(4)Public Health Department, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University, Shebeen ElKom, Egypt.(5)Cancer Studies, Guy's Hospital, King's College London, London, UK.AIMS: This study aims to assess the diagnostic agreement of lymphovascularinvasion (LVI) in invasive breast cancer (BC).METHODS: Data on LVI were collected from the UK National Health Service BreastScreening Programme pathology external quality assurance scheme database. 101 BCsassessed over a 10-year period (2004-2014) were included. Cases were scored by anaverage of 600 pathologists. Three H&E stained slides from each case werereviewed by three pathologists and additional variables were evaluated.RESULTS: In the whole series, the overall κ value was 0.4 (range 0.26-0.53). Onreview, LVI was detected in all three slides in 20 cases (20%), in two slides in 12 cases and in one of the three slides in 9 cases and was not seen in 60 cases. For concordance analysis, the first and last groups were used to represent cases with definite (LVI+) and absent LVI (LVI-), respectively. In the LVI+group(n=20), the level of agreement ranged from 0.54 to 0.99 (median 0.86). In theLVI- group (n=60), the level of agreement ranged from 0.52 to 1.00 (median 0.93),with 44% of cases showing interobserver concordance of >95%. There was acorrelation between increasing number of involved lymphovascular spaces in thesection and higher LVI reporting concordance. Some degree of retraction/fixation artefacts was observed in 35% of cases; this was associated with a lowerconcordance rate.CONCLUSIONS: The concordance of reporting LVI is variable. Cases without LVI and those with multiple involved vessels are likely to have the highest concordanceand the highest detection rates.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
