These patients are often treated with primary systemicchemotherapy. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of BRCA1/2mutations on pathologic complete response (pCR) and disease-free survival (DFS)in a cohort of patients with TNBC treated with anthracycline andtaxane-containing chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab. Patients and MethodsGermline DNA was sequenced to identify mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in 493patients with TNBC from the GeparQuinto study. The pCR rates were compared inpatients with and without mutation, as well as in patients treated with andwithout bevacizumab. In addition, the influence of BRCA1/2 mutation status andpCR status on DFS was evaluated relative to treatment. Results BRCA1/2 mutations were detected in 18.3% of patients with TNBC. Overall, patients with mutationshad a pCR rate of 50%, compared with 31.5% in patients without a mutation (oddsratio [OR], 2.17; 95% CI, 1.37 to 3.46; P = .001). The pCR rate among patientstreated with bevacizumab was 61.5% for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and 35.6% forthose without mutations (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.43 to 5.89; P = .004). pCR was astrong predictor of DFS for patients without BRCA1/2 mutations (hazard ratio,0.18; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.31) but not for patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (hazardratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.69). Conclusion The addition of bevacizumab mayincrease the pCR after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with TNBCwith BRCA1/2 mutations. In patients treated with anthracycline and taxane-basedchemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab), pCR was a weaker predictor of DFS forBRCA1/2 mutation carriers than for patients without mutations.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.77.2285 PMID: 29791287
