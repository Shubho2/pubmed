MATERIAL AND METHODS Theexpression of ALG3 in breast carcinoma tissues was determined by immunochemistry.The ability of cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion was determined by CCK-8 assay, wound healing migration assay, and cell invasion assays,respectively. The binding between HSF2 and promoter of ALG3 was determined byChIP assay. RESULTS There was an increased expression of ALG3 in breast cancertissues compared to normal breast tissues (p<0.05). High expression of ALG3 wassignificantly correlated with poor OS (p<0.05). ALG3 expression was significantlyincreased in cancer samples with advanced stages (stage III/IV) compared withthose in the early stages of disease (stage I/II) (p<0.05). The stainingintensity of ALG3 was significantly correlated to the tumor grade (grades 2-3versus 1, p<0.05). Silencing ALG3 or HSF2 inhibited the proliferation, migration,and invasion abilities of MCF-7 cells. Silencing ALG3 retarded the growth ofMCF-7 cells in vivo. CONCLUSIONS Silencing ALG3 inhibited MCF-7 cells growth invitro and in vivo. HSF2 activated ALG3 and promoted the growth of breastcarcinoma.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.907461 PMCID: PMC5996847PMID: 29799832
