These compounds when administered at optimal concentrations and especially in combination canhave enhanced effects in cancer prevention or therapy. It is important to studythe interaction of two or more compounds in order to assess their role inenhancing prevention. Genistein (GEN), found in soy, has been extensively studiedfor its role as an epigenetic modifier especially as a DNA methyltransferase(DNMT) inhibitor and sulforaphane (SFN), found in cruciferous vegetables, isknown as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. However, very little is knownabout the effects of these two compounds in conjunction in breast cancerprevention or therapy. In our current study, we determined that, at certaindoses, the compounds have synergistic effects in decreasing cellular viability ofbreast cancer cell lines. Our results indicate that the combination of GEN andSFN is much more effective than their single doses in increasing the rate ofapoptosis and lowering the colony forming potential of these cells. We determinedthat these compounds inhibit cell cycle progression to G2 phase in MDA-MB-231 andG1 phase in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, we determined that the combination is effective as an HDAC and histone methyltransferase (HMT)inhibitor. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this combination downregulates thelevels of HDAC2 and HDAC3 both at the mRNA and protein levels. We also found thatthese compounds have the potential to downregulate KLF4 levels, which plays animportant role in stem cell formation. The combination of GEN and SFN is alsoeffective in downregulating hTERT levels, which is known to be activated whenKLF4 binds to its promoter region. Our hypothesis is further strengthened by invivo studies, where the combination is administered to transgenic mice in theform of genistein and SFN-enriched broccoli sprouts. We have demonstrated thatthe combination is more effective in preventing or treating mammary cancer viaextending tumor latency and reducing tumor volumes/sizes than either of thesedietary components administered alone. These results are consistent with our invitro study suggesting potential preventive and therapeutic effects of this noveldietary combinatorial approach against breast cancer.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19061754 PMCID: PMC6032337PMID: 29899271
