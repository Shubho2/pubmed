One hundred sixty-three biopsies were performedin 155 patients. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of US-CNB, the results werecorrelated with the gold-standard of surgical excision of the breast lesions,thus, 90 patients (94 breast lesions) were included in the study group. Wecalculated the concordance of the results using the Kappa Coefficient,sensitivity and specificity using the ROC curve and the false-negative rate.Results: US-CNB identified 74 (79%) malignant lesions, 1 (1%) precursor high-risklesion, and 19 (20%) benign lesions. Concordance between histopathologicalresults was 96.8% (kappa: 0.91). The 94.2% (kappa: 0.80) consensus of thehistological type could be calculated for 70 invasive carcinomas. The 61.8%(kappa: 0.41) concordance of the histological grade could be calculated for 55invasive carcinomas. Sensitivity and specificity were 98.6%, and 100%,respectively. The false-negative rate was 1.3%. Conclusions: US-CNB is anexcellent alternative to surgical biopsy in establishing the histopathologicaldiagnosis of breast lesions, provided it is performed by a specialized team andthere is clinical-radiological-histopathological concordance in all cases.Celsius.DOI: 10.21614/chirurgia.113.2.244 PMID: 29733018  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
