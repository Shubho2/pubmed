The identification of acirculating miRNA signature should distinguish autotaxin-mediated disease andalso elucidate unknown molecular mechanisms that rationalize its malignantpotential. Using female transgenic 'AT-ATX' mice, whereby human wild-typeautotaxin is expressed in liver under the control of the alpha-1 antitrypsinpromoter, transgenic animals express augmented autotaxin in circulation and apercentage develop tumors. Serum collected at necropsy had circulating miRNAsanalyzed for statistical significance. The ensuing autotaxin-mediated miRNomedifferentiated between groups: healthy FVB/N mice versus AT-ATX mice with andwithout tumors. Intriguingly, miR-489-3p was sharply increased in AT-ATXtumor-bearing mice. Tissue analysis showed a correlation between miR-489-3pexpression in tumors and surrounding milieu with autotaxin concentration incirculation. Sequence alignment suggested miR-489-3p targets MEK1, which wasconfirmed through in vitro studies. Exogenously added miR-489-3p, which decreasesMEK1 in normal cells, dramatically increased MEK1 expression in cells stablyexpressing autotaxin. Taken together, this suggests that autotaxin overrides the normal regulatory function of miR-489-3p to inhibit MEK1 via coordinatelyincreased miR-489-3p appearing in serum.Copyright Â© 2018.
