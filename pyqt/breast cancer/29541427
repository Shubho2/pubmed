The flavonoids, natural antioxidant compounds, account for a majorgroup of polyphenolic compounds. One of the major isoflavones in soybean isgenistein (GE) which can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis. Isoflavones,major type of phenolic materials, derived from dietary plants and medicinal herbsplay a significant role in cancer prevention and treatment. Correlation betweendietary habits and cancer risk including breast, prostate, and colon cancer hasbeen reported. Various bioactivities of these compounds such as anticarcinogenic and antioxidant are responsible for their chemopreventive activities by whichinduce migration, proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. GE, one of themajor isoflavones, is considered as a potent chemopreventive agent againstcancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory and apoptoticeffects of GE on HCC Hepa1-6 cell line.Methods: Cell viability assay and cell cycle analysis with flow cytometry wereused to evaluate proliferative and apoptotic effect GE.Results: GE inhibited the growth of Hepa1-6 cells and induced apoptosis with aconcentration and time-dependent fashion. During GE treatment for 24, the halfmaximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 20 μM, and the maximum inhibition of cell growth was 52% (P < 0.01). The percentage of apoptotic cells with aconcentration of 20 μM of GE after 24, 48, and 72 h was 35, 42, and 65%,respectively (P < 0.01).Conclusions: Our finding clearly indicated that GE can significantly inhibitproliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma Hepa 1-6 cell line and induce apoptosisin this cell line.DOI: 10.4103/ijpvm.IJPVM_249_16 PMCID: PMC5843956PMID: 29541427
