Thepresent study introduces the preparation and characterization of the potentialtherapeutic efficiency of curcumin (CUR)-loaded denderimer-modified citric acidcoated Fe3O4 NPs. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM, generation G5) was used to encapsulatecitric acid coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The successful preparation of CUR-loaded nanocarriers were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetricanalysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Theloading capacity and encapsulation efficiency of CUR molecules were 12 ± 0.03%and 45.58 ± 0.41%, respectively. The anticancer effect of void CUR and CUR-loadednanocarriers were compared to each other by3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay on treatedMCF-7 cell line. It can be concluded that application of nanoparticles can bemore effective strategy for controlled and slow release of CUR in human breastcancer treatment.DOI: 10.1080/03639045.2018.1451881 PMID: 29560737
