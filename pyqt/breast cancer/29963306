China.Hyperplasia of mammary glands (HMG) is also termed mammary dysplasia. In China,the number of patients suffering from breast hyperplasia is increasing annually. MicroRNAs (miRNAs; length, 19-24 nucleotides), a group of small endogenousnon-coding RNAs, post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression via RNAinterference and gene silencing pathways. The cause of disease of HMG becauseremains unclear. Thus, the aim of the present study was to establishcomprehensive profile of drug treatments following at different time intervals onrat models of differentially expressed miRNAs, using miRNA microarray data. Afterscanning the chip, 13 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated miRNAs were identified. MiR-31 and miR-30 exhibited different expression levels between rats exhibitingmammary gland hyperplasia treated with or without Jiedu Capsule water solutiononce a day for 4 weeks, and the two demonstrated a strong association with HMGand breast cancer. Therefore, the functions of these miRNAs may provide the basisfor further investigation of HMG.DOI: 10.3892/br.2018.1106 PMCID: PMC6020446PMID: 29963306
