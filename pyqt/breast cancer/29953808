Recently, benzothiazole rhodacyanines have been shown to bind anallosteric site on Hsp70, interrupting its binding to nucleotide-exchange factors(NEFs) and promoting cell death in breast cancer cell lines. However,proof-of-concept molecules, such as JG-98, have relatively modest potency (EC50 ≈0.7-0.4 μM) and are rapidly metabolized in animals. Here, we explored thischemical series through structure- and property-based design of ∼300 analogs,showing that the most potent had >10-fold improved EC50 values (∼0.05 to 0.03 μM)against two breast cancer cells. Biomarkers and whole genome CRISPRi screensconfirmed members of the Hsp70 family as cellular targets. On the basis of these results, JG-231 was found to reduce tumor burden in an MDA-MB-231 xenograft model(4 mg/kg, ip). Together, these studies support the hypothesis that Hsp70 may be apromising target for anticancer therapeutics.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00583 PMID: 29953808
