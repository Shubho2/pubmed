We used BLT to guide irradiation delivery and quantitatively assessirradiation-induced tumor response.METHODS AND MATERIALS: BLT was first validated on a tissue-simulating phantom,where the internal chemiluminescent liquid had a constant volume while itsluminescence intensity gradually decayed. Then, in vivo experiments wereperformed on BALB/c mice orthotopically inoculated with 4T1 breast carcinomacells expressing luciferase. Animals either received radiation treatment(radiation therapy [RT] group, n = 9) or did not (control group, n = 9). BLT was used to guide delivery of a single-fraction 5-Gy radiation dose to the tumor and to evaluate the treatment response. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasedeoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was used toevaluate irradiation-induced DNA damage and cell apoptosis.RESULTS: Phantom results showed that BLT not only recovered the constant targetvolume with <2% deviation but also accurately monitored the decay of thechemiluminescent molecules. For the RT group of animals, there was significantreduction in both the BLT-based tumor volume (21% ± 10%, P = .001) andbioluminescence intensity (48% ± 17%, P = .0008). For the control group, asignificant increase was detected in the BLT tumor volume (35% ± 12%, P < .0001) but not the BLT bioluminescence intensity (P = .4). There was a significantdifference in the BLT tumor volume between the RT and control groups 7 days afterirradiation (P = .03). Regression analysis suggests a strong correlation between the BLT and cone beam computed tomography tumor volume (R2 = 0.93). Analysisusing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick endlabeling staining showed a significant difference in tumor cell apoptosis betweenthe RT and control groups (20.6% ± 2.9% and 3.2% ± 1.7%, respectively; P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: BLT onboard the image guided small animal arc radiation treatmentplatform can be used to accurately guide irradiation delivery and toquantitatively assess treatment response by simultaneously monitoring tumorvolume and cancer cell population.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
