Digital breasttomosynthesis (DBT) was developed to reduce such summation effects. Purpose Toevaluate the influence of an additional DBT on the management of mammographicBI-RADS 3 findings and whether DBT can decrease the time to definitive diagnosis or not. Material and Methods We analyzed 87 patients with a mammographicnon-calcified BI-RADS 3 lesion who underwent an additional DBT of the affectedbreast. A follow-up two-dimensional (2D) examination or a histological result of the lesion had to be available. The images were analyzed especially for theBI-RADS category and incremental diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the inter-reader reliability and the radiation dose were evaluated. Results The BI-RADS categoryhas been changed by the addition of DBT: 57.1% were assessed as BI-RADS 1 or 2,4.6% as BI-RADS 4, and only 38.3% remained as BI-RADS 3. The intraclasscorrelation coefficient for the three readers showed a good agreement forinter-reader reliability. No false-negative examination was found in thefollow-ups. Nine lesions were biopsied (seven benign, two malignant). Bothmalignant lesions were suspicious in the DBT (BI-RADS 4). A significant higherglandular dose was necessary for the DBT. Conclusion DBT has the potential toreduce the recall-rate of BI-RADS 3 lesions and to find and diagnose malignantlesions earlier than 2D mammography alone.DOI: 10.1177/0284185118756458 PMID: 29451022
