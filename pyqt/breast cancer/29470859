This study evaluates agreement between multiple biopsy targets withinthe same screen-detected widespread (≥25 mm) breast calcification to determine ifthe second biopsy adds value.METHODS: Retrospective observational study of women screened in a statewidegeneral population risk breast cancer mammographic screening program from 2009 to2016. Screening episodes recalled for widespread calcifications where furtherviews indicated biopsy, and two or more separate target areas were sampled withinthe same lesion were included. Percentage agreement and Cohen's Kappa werecalculated.RESULTS: A total of 293317 women were screened during 761124 separate episodeswith recalls for widespread calcifications in 2355 episodes. In 171 women, asecond target was biopsied within the same lesion. In 149 (86%) cases, the secondtarget biopsy result agreed with the first biopsy (κ = 0.6768). Agreementincreased with increasing mammography score (85%, 86% and 92% for score 3, 4 and 5 lesions). Same day multiple biopsied lesions were three times more likely toyield concordant results compared to post-hoc second target biopsy cases.CONCLUSION: While a single target biopsy is sufficient to discriminate a benignvs. malignant diagnosis in most cases, in 14% there is added value in performing a second target biopsy. Biopsies performed prospectively are more likely to yieldconcordant results compared to post-hoc second target biopsy cases, suggesting a single prospective biopsy may be sufficient when results areradiological-pathological concordant; discordance still requires repeat sampling.© 2018 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.DOI: 10.1111/1754-9485.12715 PMID: 29470859
