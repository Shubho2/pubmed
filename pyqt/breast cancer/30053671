We evaluatedoutcomes with palbociclib plus endocrine therapy in patients aged ≥65 years.METHODS: Data were pooled from three randomised studies (NCT00721409,NCT01740427 and NCT01942135) of women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer(ABC). In PALOMA-1 (open-label) and PALOMA-2 (double-blind, placebo-controlled), treatment-naïve patients received palbociclib plus letrozole or letrozole alone. In PALOMA-3 (double-blind, placebo-controlled), patients with endocrine-resistantdisease received palbociclib plus fulvestrant or fulvestrant alone.RESULTS: Among 528 patients treated with palbociclib plus letrozole and 347treated with palbociclib plus fulvestrant, 218 (41.3%) and 86 (24.8%),respectively, were aged ≥65 years. Versus endocrine therapy alone, medianprogression-free survival was significantly improved in patients aged 65-74 years(hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.97; P = 0.016) and≥75 years (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.16-0.61; P<0.001) receiving palbociclib plusletrozole and in patients aged 65-74 years (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16-0.48; P<0.001)receiving palbociclib plus fulvestrant; few patients aged ≥75 years receivedpalbociclib plus fulvestrant (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.19-1.8; P = 0.18).Patient-reported functioning and quality of life was maintained. No clinicallyrelevant differences in palbociclib exposure were observed between age groups.Although myelosuppression was more common among patients aged ≥75 years,incidence of grade ≥III myelosuppression was similar across age groups, andfebrile neutropenia was uncommon (≤2.4%); no new safety concerns were identified in older patients.CONCLUSIONS: Palbociclib plus endocrine therapy is an effective, well-toleratedtreatment for older patients with ABC.Copyright © 2018.
