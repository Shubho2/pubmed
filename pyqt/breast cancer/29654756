Electronic address: j.park@massey.ac.nz.PPM1B is a metal-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase, with a similarstructure and function to the well-known oncogene in breast cancer, PPM1D (WIP1).However, clinical significance of PPM1B as a pharmacological target in cancertherapy has not been explored. To test if PPM1B can be a drug target in thecellular proliferation and death pathway, the lentiviral PPM1B shRNA was stablyexpressed in cancer cell lines and its regulatory function in the RB1-E2F1pathway was examined. We found that PPM1B depletion suppressed cellularproliferation of U2OS cells, accompanied by hyper-phosphorylation of RB1 andup-regulation of E2F1 target genes, p27 and caspase 7. Notably, PPM1B depletionsignificantly sensitised U2OS cells to bleomycin-induced cell death at a minimal effective concentration. Our results suggest that PPM1B plays a negative role in the activation of the p38-RB1-E2F1 pathway and that targeting PPM1B could beuseful in certain types of cancer by stimulating chemotherapy-induced cell death.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
