A robust immune score quantification is needed tointroduce immune parameters into cancer classification. The aim of the study was to assess the prognostic value of total tumour-infiltrating T-cell counts andcytotoxic tumour-infiltrating T-cells counts with the consensus Immunoscore assayin patients with stage I-III colon cancer.METHODS: An international consortium of 14 centres in 13 countries, led by theSociety for Immunotherapy of Cancer, assessed the Immunoscore assay in patientswith TNM stage I-III colon cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to a training set, an internal validation set, or an external validation set. Paraffin sectionsof the colon tumour and invasive margin from each patient were processed byimmunohistochemistry, and the densities of CD3+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in thetumour and in the invasive margin were quantified by digital pathology. AnImmunoscore for each patient was derived from the mean of four densitypercentiles. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the prognostic value of theImmunoscore for time to recurrence, defined as time from surgery to diseaserecurrence. Stratified multivariable Cox models were used to assess theassociations between Immunoscore and outcomes, adjusting for potentialconfounders. Harrell's C-statistics was used to assess model performance.FINDINGS: Tissue samples from 3539 patients were processed, and samples from 2681patients were included in the analyses after quality controls (700 patients inthe training set, 636 patients in the internal validation set, and 1345 patients in the external validation set). The Immunoscore assay showed a high level ofreproducibility between observers and centres (r=0·97 for colon tumour; r=0·97for invasive margin; p<0·0001). In the training set, patients with a highImmunoscore had the lowest risk of recurrence at 5 years (14 [8%] patients with ahigh Immunoscore vs 65 (19%) patients with an intermediate Immunoscore vs 51(32%) patients with a low Immunoscore; hazard ratio [HR] for high vs lowImmunoscore 0·20, 95% CI 0·10-0·38; p<0·0001). The findings were confirmed in thetwo validation sets (n=1981). In the stratified Cox multivariable analysis, theImmunoscore association with time to recurrence was independent of patient age,sex, T stage, N stage, microsatellite instability, and existing prognosticfactors (p<0·0001). Of 1434 patients with stage II cancer, the difference in riskof recurrence at 5 years was significant (HR for high vs low Immunoscore 0·33,95% CI 0·21-0·52; p<0·0001), including in Cox multivariable analysis (p<0·0001). Immunoscore had the highest relative contribution to the risk of all clinicalparameters, including the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union forInternational Cancer Control TNM classification system.INTERPRETATION: The Immunoscore provides a reliable estimate of the risk ofrecurrence in patients with colon cancer. These results support theimplementation of the consensus Immunoscore as a new component of a TNM-Immuneclassification of cancer.FUNDING: French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, the LabExImmuno-oncology, the Transcan ERAnet Immunoscore European project, Associationpour la Recherche contre le Cancer, CARPEM, AP-HP, Institut National du Cancer,Italian Association for Cancer Research, national grants and the Society forImmunotherapy of Cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
