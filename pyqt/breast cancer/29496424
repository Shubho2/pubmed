The purpose of this study isto determine the most appropriate time postimplant to perform this analysis.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nine patients treated at our institution with PBSI wereincluded in this analysis. Each underwent 4 postimplant CT scans: 0, 15, 30, and 60 days postimplant. A model of the accumulated dose was created by deformablyregistering the Day 15, 30, and 60 postimplant CT scans and dose matrices to the Day 0 scan, scaling for seed decay. The results from this model were compared to each individual postplan by integral comparison of dose-volume histogram curvesfor a dose evaluation volume.RESULTS: The Day 30 postplan showed the best agreement with the accumulated dose model and the smallest interpatient variability across the patient cohort. Themean (±SD) for the dose evaluation volume V90, V100, V150, and V200 for theaccumulated dose model was 90 ± 7%, 86 ± 8%, 66 ± 14%, and 41 ± 16%,respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this patient cohort, we recommend thatpostimplant dosimetric analysis for PBSI be performed approximately 30 daysfollowing the implant.Copyright © 2018 American Brachytherapy Society.
