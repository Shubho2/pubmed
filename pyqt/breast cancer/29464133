Breast centres have been introduced in Europe and reported to facilitate diagnosis and treatment. Guidelines for breast centers are outlined by theEuropean Society for Mastology (EUSOMA). A Rapid Access Breast Clinic (RABC) was developed at our hospital applying the concept of triple evaluation for allpatients and navigation between clinicians and radiologists. We hypothesizethat the Rapid Access Breast Clinic will decrease wait times to diagnosis andminimize duplication of services compared to usual care. Methods A retrospective review was undertaken looking at diagnostic wait times and the number ofdiagnostic centres involved for consecutive patients seen by breast surgeons withdiagnostic workups performed either in the traditional system (TS) or the RABC.Only patients presenting with a new breast problem were included in the study.Results Patients seen at the RABC had a decreased time to surgical consultation(33 vs 86 days, p<0.0001) for both malignant (36 vs 59 days, p=0.0007) and benigndiagnoses (31 vs 95 days, p<0.0001). Furthermore, 13% of the patients referred tothe surgeon in the TS without a diagnosis were eventually diagnosed with amalignancy and waited a mean of 84 days for initial surgical assessment. Of thepatients seen at the RABC, 5% required investigation at more than one institutioncompared to 39% patients seen in the TS (p<0.0001). Cancer patients had a shortertime from presentation to surgery in the RABC (64 vs 92 days, p=0.009).Conclusion The establishment of the RABC has significantly reduced the time tosurgical consultation, time to breast cancer surgery, and duplication ofinvestigations for patients with benign and malignant breast complaints. It isfeasible to introduce a EUSOMA-based breast clinic in the Canadian Health CareSystem and improvements in diagnostic wait times are seen. We recommend theexpansion of coordinated care to other sites.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.1919 PMCID: PMC5807023PMID: 29464133
