Electronic address: robsonqm@bioqmed.ufrj.br.Extracellular vesicles, such as microvesicles (MVs), were identified as importantplayers in tumor progression and acquisition of an aggressive phenotype. Tissuefactor (TF) is a transmembrane protein that initiates the blood coagulationcascade. In tumor cells, TF has been associated with aggressiveness and cancerprogression. Previous studies demonstrate that TF is incorporated into MVssecreted by tumor cells; however, it is unknown whether TF is actively involvedin the release of MVs. Here, we investigated the influence of TF expression onthe release of MVs. TF silencing was achieved through CRISPR/Cas9 approaches inthe human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. TF knockout in MDA-MB-231 cellsefficiently reduced TF-dependent signaling and procoagulant activity. Remarkably,silencing of TF caused a significant decrease in the number of MVs released byMDA-MB-231 cells. We also observed an increase in actin-positive membraneprojections in TF knockout cells and a reduction in RhoA expression when comparedto TF-expressing cells. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with the RhoA-ROCKsignaling pathway inhibitor, fasudil, significantly reduced the release of MVs.Taken together, our results suggest a novel and relevant role for TF in tumorbiology by playing an active role in the MVs secretion.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
