However, the target genes and underlyingmechanisms remain largely unknown. We conducted a cis-expression quantitativetrait loci (cis-eQTL) analysis using normal or tumor breast transcriptome datafrom the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC),The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)project. We identified a total of 101 genes for 51 lead variants after combingthe results of a meta-analysis of METABRIC and TCGA, and the results from GTEx ata Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-adjusted p < 0.05. Using luciferase reporter assays in both estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) cell lines, we showedthat alternative alleles of potential functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs11552449 (DCLRE1B), rs7257932 (SSBP4), rs3747479 (MRPS30), rs2236007(PAX9), and rs73134739 (ATG10), could significantly change promoter activities oftheir target genes compared to reference alleles. Furthermore, we performedin vitro assays in breast cancer cell lines, and our results indicated thatDCLRE1B, MRPS30, and ATG10 played a vital role in breast tumorigenesis viacertain disruption of cell behaviors. Our findings revealed potential targetgenes for associations of genetic susceptibility risk loci and providedunderlying mechanisms for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of breastcancer.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics.
