Compared to single agents, combinationchemotherapy produces higher response rates (RR), longer progression-freesurvival (PFS) than single agents. This is associated with remarkably highertoxicities. At the same time, overall survival (OS) is comparable. This studyaimed to compare safety and efficacy of combination and sequential chemotherapy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six MBC patients were randomized to receive 6 cycles of the combination of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and cisplatin (70 mg/m2)(combination PC) or paclitaxel for 3 cycles followed by cisplatin for 3 cycles(sequential PC). Endpoints were RR, PFS, OS and safety.RESULTS: Both combination and sequential PC produced similar RR (52% in botharms) and disease control rates (78.3% vs. 73.9%, p = .652). Responses werefaster in the combination arm. Median PFS was 8.2 months in the combinationcompared to 5.0 months in the sequential arm (p = .064). The median OS was 16.5and 18.8 months in the combination and sequential arms, respectively (p = .866). The combination was more toxic than sequential PC. Grade 3 toxicities were higherwith combination PC than to sequential PC (48% vs. 4.3%; p < .001).CONCLUSION: Sequential agent chemotherapy may provide similar response rate andoverall survival to combination chemotherapy with much lower toxicities. Theformer can be considered the standard practice in most instances.Copyright © 2018 National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. Production andhosting by Elsevier B.V.
