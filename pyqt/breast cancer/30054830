HigherGSTM3 mRNA levels were reported in patients with ERα-positive breast cancer whoreceived only tamoxifen therapy after surgery. Thus, this study aimed to clarify the oncogenic characteristics of GSTM3 in breast cancer and the mechanism oftamoxifen resistance.METHODS: GSTM3 expression in human breast tumour tissues (n = 227) was analysedby RT-PCR and quantitative PCR. Western blot, promoter activity assays, andchromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to investigate themechanism of GSTM3 gene regulation. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cytotoxicityin breast cancer cells was detected by MTT assays and flow cytometry. Theoncogenic characteristics of GSTM3 in MCF-7 cells were examined by siRNAknockdown in soft agar assays and a xenograft animal model.RESULTS: GSTM3 mRNA was highly expressed in ER- and HER2-positive breast cancers.Moreover, patients who received adjuvant Herceptin had increased GSTM3 mRNAlevels in tumour tissue. Oestrogen-activated GSTM3 gene expression throughERα-mediated recruitment of SP1, EP300, and AP-1 complexes. GSTM3-silenced MCF-7 cells were more sensitive to H2O2, with significantly inhibited proliferation andcolony formation abilities. Tamoxifen-resistant (Tam-R) cells lacking GSTM3showed enhanced sensitivity to H2O2, but this result was contrary to thatobtained after short-term tamoxifen exposure. The animal model suggested thatGSTM3 silencing might suppress the tumourigenic ability of MCF-7 cells andincrease tumour cell apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: ROS production is one mechanism by which cancer drugs kill tumourcells, and according to our evidence, GSTM3 may play an important role inpreventing breast cancer treatment-induced cellular cytotoxicity.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4897-5 PMID: 30054830
