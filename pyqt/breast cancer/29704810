Electronic address: sonyumee@naver.com.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the additive value of shear wave elastography (SWE) for differentiating benign and metastatic axillary lymph nodes (LNs) in breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The area under the receiver operating characteristiccurve, sensitivity, and specificity of B-mode US, SWE, and combined modality werecompared for 54 suspicious LNs.RESULTS: After combining information from SWE, sensitivity was significantlyhigher for combined modality than for B-mode US alone (94.12% vs. 82.35%,p = 0.046) without a decrease in specificity.CONCLUSION: Combined B-mode US and SWE may improve detection of metastaticaxillary LNs in patients with breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
