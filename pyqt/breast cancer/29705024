It is hypothesizedthat chemotherapy reduces circulating VEGF levels and leads to cognitive decline among patients. This multicenter longitudinal study aimed to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on VEGF levels and the association between VEGF levels andcognitive function.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 145 early-stage breast cancer patients wererecruited and assessed before chemotherapy (T1), during chemotherapy (T2), and atthe end of chemotherapy (T3). At each time point, plasma VEGF levels wereassessed using a multiplex immunoassay. Cognitive function was assessed usingboth Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function, Version 3(FACT-Cog), and Headminder (a computerized, web-based neuropsychologic battery).RESULTS: Generally, we observed higher-than-baseline plasma VEGF levels after thestart of chemotherapy (P < .001). Among patients receiving anthracycline-basedchemotherapy, the median plasma VEGF levels were significantly higher at T2 (T2: 37.3 pg/mL vs. T1: 21.3 pg/mL; P < .001) and T3 (T3: 35.5 pg/mL vs. T1: 21.3pg/mL; P < .001) than at baseline. Plasma VEGF levels were not associated withchemotherapy-associated cognitive impairment.CONCLUSION: Breast cancer patients experience an increasing trend in plasma VEGF levels during chemotherapy, and the regimen types may have a differential effect on circulating VEGF levels. Furthermore, changes in plasma VEGF levels duringchemotherapy were not associated with cognitive impairment. VEGF may play a minorrole in mediating the occurrence of chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.03.016 PMID: 29705024
