Inclusion criteria involved stage I- III breast carcinoma; radicalsurgery performed and 4 courses of AC regimen (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide),or at least 6 courses of FAC regimen (fluorouracil, doxorubicin andcyclophosphamide) completed; no neoadjuvant chemotherapy applied; no taxane groupmedications administered; medical records maintain comprehensive data ontreatment and follow-up. 5- year overall survival were analyzed usingKaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: Significant 3.17 times higher death risk at 5 year period in patientswho experienced anthracycline dose reduction compared with patients who did notexperience any modifications was established (HR = 3.17, 95% CI 1.7-5.9,p < 0.001). Increased death risk in patients who experienced both chemotherapydose reduction and treatment delays compared with patients who did not experienceany modifications was also established (HR = 2.76, 95% CI 1.3-5.6, p < 0.05). 5- year overall survival was affected by anthracycline dose reduction by more than15% in ER-HER2- group (80% v. 55.6%, p = 0.015), ER + HER2- group (90.7% v.64.9%, p < 0.01) and ER+/-HER2+ group (100% v. 84.4%, p = 0.019). 5-year overall survival was affected by chemotherapy delays more than 2 cycles in ER-HER2- group(79.2% v. 51.4%, p = 0.002), ER + HER2- group (86.3% v. 58.8%, p = 0.014) andthere was no difference in ER+/-HER2+ group. Main reasons for chemotherapy schememodifications (in decreasing order) were the following: neutropenia,modifications with no objective medical reasons, thrombocytopenia, anaemia,fatigue, infection.CONCLUSIONS: Anthracycline dose reduction in patients with stage I- III breastcancer were associated with higher mortality risk and significantly decreased 5- year absolute survival in all molecular subtypes. Chemotherapy delays alone were not associated with decreased survival only in HER2 positive subtype. The mostcommon reason for dose reduction or chemotherapy delays was neutropenia.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4365-y PMCID: PMC5910571PMID: 29678165
