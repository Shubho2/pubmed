These patientsunderwent SLNB with nanocarbon as the tracer from March 2013 to April 2014.RESULTS: Two hundred and forty six patients of sentinel lymph node (SLN) weresuccessfully detected. Among these patients, 8 patients had 1 SLN (3.25%), 33patients had 2 SLN (13.41%), 46 patients had 3 SLN (18.70%), 51 patients had 4SLN (20.73%), 40 patients had 5 SLN (16.26%), 24 patients had 6 SLN (9.76%) and24 patients had 7 or more SLN (9.76%). The SLNB success rate of nanocarbonstaining in the 246 cases was 99.59%, accuracy rate was 97.06% and sensitivitywas 93.22%. Furthermore, false negatives were found in four patients, and thefalse-negative rate was 6.78%. The number of lymph node metastasis in the SLNBand ALND of early-stage breast cancer was analyzed. When the number of SLNdissection was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, the coincidence rate of lymph nodemetastasis for SLNB and ALND was 80.00, 84.36, 78.57, 88.89, 90.48, 80.00, 73.68 and 78.36, respectively.CONCLUSION: Sentinel lymph node biopsy performed using the nanocarbon stainingmethod is simple, easy and reliable, and it can be used to predict the axillarystatus of breast cancer in the early stage.Â© 2018 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.DOI: 10.1111/jog.13635 PMID: 29673015
