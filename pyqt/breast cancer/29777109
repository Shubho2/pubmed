Thus, developing novel treatmentsfor metastatic TNBC is an urgent need. Here, we show that nanoparticle-mediateddelivery of transforming growth factor-β1-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) inhibitor5Z-7-Oxozeaenol can inhibit TNBC lung metastasis in most animals tested. P38 is acentral signal downstream of TAK1 in TNBC cells in TAK1-mediated response tomultiple cytokines. Following co-culturing with macrophages or fibroblasts, TNBC cells express interleukin-1 (IL1) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα),respectively. Compared to TAK1 inhibition, suppressing IL1 signaling withrecombinant IL1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA) is less efficient in reducing lungmetastasis, possibly due to the additional TAK1 signals coming from distinctstromal cells. Together, these observations suggest that TAK1 may play a central role in promoting TNBC cell adaptation to the lung microenvironment byfacilitating positive feedback signaling mediated by P38. Approaches targetingthe key TAK1-P38 signal could offer a novel means for suppressing TNBC lungmetastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04460-w PMCID: PMC5959931PMID: 29777109
