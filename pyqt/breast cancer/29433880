Disparities have been reported in breast cancer outcomes; however, the effect of SDs remains unknown. We sought to examine the effect of SDs on breastreconstruction (BR) after mastectomy and the differences between patients in boththe cohorts.METHODS: Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database years 2007-2011, weidentified International Classification of Diseases 9th edition codes for breast cancer, mastectomy, and BR in California. SDs were identified using the American College of Surgeons Health Policy Research Institute workforce atlas. Dataincluded patient demographics and socioeconomic status, and the primary outcomewas the rates of BR.RESULTS: A total of 9325 mastectomy patients, with or without BR, wereidentified. Of this, 12.8% patients were in SDs, whereas 87.2% patients were innonsurgical deserts (NSDs). Overall, 35.8% of patients received BR, whereas 64.2%did not. Of the patients in SDs, only 14% received BR, whereas in NSDs, 39%received BR. On multivariate analysis, SD patients were significantly less likelyto receive BR than NSD patients (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.29[0.24-0.35]; P < 0.001). SDs had higher rates of low household income, Medicareinsurance, and comorbidities. NSDs had higher rates of high household income,Health Maintenance Organization/private insurance, and lower rates ofcomorbidities.CONCLUSIONS: Patients in SDs are significantly less likely to receive BR. Thisdisparity may be magnified because of differences in demographics and incomelevels, and decreased access to reconstructive surgeons. Interventions aimed atdecreasing disparities caused by SDs are needed.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.jss.2017.11.011 PMID: 29433880
