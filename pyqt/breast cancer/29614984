However, the expression pattern and involvement of TINCR in breast cancer has not been fully investigated. Here we set out toanalyze expression of TINCR in breast cancer and elucidate its mechanisticinvolvement in tumor incidence and progression.METHODS: The expression of TINCR was determined by q-PCR. SP1 binding sites were analyzed by ChIP-qPCR. The relative transcription activity was measured withluciferase reporter assay. Cell viability was measured with CCK-8 method.Clonogenic capacity was evaluated by soft agar assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzedby Annexin V/7-AAD staining. The migration and invasion were determined bytrans-well assay and wound healing. The tumor growth in vivo was evaluated inxenograft mice model. Protein expression was quantified by immunoblotting.RESULTS: TINCR was aberrantly up-regulated by SP1, which in turn stimulated cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and suppressed cell apoptosis inbreast cancer. TINCR silencing significantly suppressed migration and invasion invitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, TINCR modulated KLF4expression via competing with miR-7, which consequently contributed to itsoncogenic potential. MiR-7 inhibition severely compromised TINCRsilencing-elicited tumor repressive effects.CONCLUSION: Our data uncovered a crucial role of TINCR-miR-7-KLF4 axis in humanbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4255-3 PMCID: PMC5883880PMID: 29614984
