Electronic address: youlia.kirova@curie.fr.PURPOSE: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy needs the strict delineation of target volumes as well as organs at risk and the time used for this procedure is long.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Workflow Box system (MiradaMedical, UK) for automatic delineation and segmentation for everyday use oforgans at risk and lymph nodes delineation in patients treated for early stagebreast cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty patients' CT scans in treatment position for theirbreast cancer radiotherapy were delineated in respect of the ESTRO delineationguidelines to begin the creation of automatic delineation atlas. Then 30 other CTscans were delineated this time by the automatic delineation system and by theradiation oncologist (reference delineation plan). The precision of thedelineation was evaluated using the overlap volume index and evaluation ofstandard deviation (SD).RESULTS: The study of organs at risk has shown that the mean overlap volumes werebetween 0.49 (SD=0.21) and 0.97 (ET=0.03). Five organs at risk out of nine hadoverlap volumes at least 0.8. The mean overlap volume for all organs at risk was 0.77 (SD=0.17). The system was less performing for the lymph nodes with a meanoverlap volume of 0.43 (SD=0.1) and ranging between 0.23 (SD=0.13) and 0.52(SD=0.1). The use of this system reduced the delineation time by 40% per patient.CONCLUSIONS: For patients with breast cancer, the system for automaticdelineation and segmentation Workflow Box (Mirada Medical, UK) permitted tosafely shorten the time for delineation with acceptable organs at riskdelineation. Improvement of lymph node volumes is needed. A new evaluation willbe realized after using the system in routine practice.Copyright © 2018 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO).
