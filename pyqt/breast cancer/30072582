[Epub ahead of print]Circular RNA ciRS-7 Maintains Metastatic Phenotypes as a ceRNA of miR-1299 toTarget MMPs.Sang M(1), Meng L(2), Liu S(2), Ding P(2), Chang S(2), Ju Y(2), Liu F(2), GuL(2), Lian Y(2), Geng C(3).Author information: (1)Research Center, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical University.(2)The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical University.(3)Breast Center, Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical Universitycuizhigeng@hotmail.com.Circular RNA ciRS-7 has been reported to act as a competing endogenous RNA(ceRNA) of the miRNA miR-7, resulting in reduced miR-7 activity and increasedmiR-7-targeted transcripts. However, it is unknown if ciRS-7 harbors other miRNAswith regulatory roles in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The present study,determined that the expression of ciRS-7 in TNBC clinical specimens andrepresentative cells is significantly higher than other breast cancer subtypes.Functionally, down-regulation of ciRS-7 inhibited cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Knockdown of ciRS-7 expression also inhibited the liver and lungmetastasis of TNBC cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that ciRS-7contains twenty miR-1299 binding sites and functions as a ceRNA of miR-1299 inTNBC cells. High expression of ciRS-7 maintains the high migration and invasionproperties of TNBC cells by acting as a ceRNA of miR-1299 to enhance theexpression of matrix metalloproteinases family members (MMPs).IMPLICATIONS:Circular RNA ciRS-7 is highly expressed in TNBC tumor specimens and cells, andits down-regulation inhibits cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells in vitroand in vivo. In addition, ciRS-7 functions as a ceRNA of miR-1299 to enhance the expression of MMPs, which maintains the high migration and invasion properties ofTNBC cells.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0284 PMID: 30072582
