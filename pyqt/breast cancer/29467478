Our aim was to improve and standardize HER2amplification detection in bladder cancer. We assessed immunohistochemicalcriteria derived from 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/Collegeof American Pathologists (CAPs) guidelines for breast cancer and investigatedintratumoral heterogeneity in a retrospective multicentric cohort of 188 patientswith locally advanced urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Immunohistochemistrywas performed on 178 primary tumors and 126 lymph node metastases, eligible cases(moderate/strong, complete/incomplete membrane staining) were assessed by FISH.HER2 overexpression was more frequent with 2013 ASCO/CAP than 2007 ASCO/CAPguidelines (p < 0.0001). The rate of positive HER2 FISH was similar betweenprimary tumor and lymph node metastases (8%). Among positive FISH cases, 48% wereassociated with moderate/strong incomplete membrane staining that were not scoredeligible for FISH by 2007 ASCO/CAP criteria. Among 3+ immunohistochemistry score cases, 67% were associated with HER2-positive FISH. Concordance between primarytumors and matched lymph node metastases was moderate for immunohistochemistry(κ = 0.54 (CI 95%, 0.41-0.67)) and FISH (κ = 0.50 (CI 95%, 0.20-0.79)).HER2-positive FISH was more frequent in micropapillary carcinomas (12%) andcarcinoma with squamous differentiation (11%) than in pure conventional carcinoma(6%). Intratumoral heterogeneity for HER2 immunohistochemistry was observed in 7%primary tumor and 6% lymph node metastases; 24% positive HER2 FISH presentedintratumoral heterogeneity. Our study suggests that HER2 evaluation shouldinclude an immunohistochemistry screening step with eligibility for FISHincluding incomplete/complete and moderate/strong membrane staining. Spatial ortemporal intratumoral heterogeneity prompts to perform evaluation on both tumorand lymph node, and for each histological variant observed.DOI: 10.1038/s41379-018-0023-9 PMID: 29467478
