Mechanisticstudies revealed that RDD648 facilitated STAT3 to translocate into the nucleus,and this activity was involved in lysosome-mediated cell death as evidenced byour finding that inhibition of STAT3 alleviated lysosomal membranepermeabilization. Further investigation indicated that nuclear STAT3 directlyinteracted with transcription factor TFEB, leading to the partial loss offunction of TFEB, which is essential for lysosome turnover. The present studyfirst uncovers that STAT3 contributes to lysosomal-mediated cell death inRDD648-treated breast cancer cells though interacting with TFEB, and the findingsmay be significant in the design of treatments for breast cancers where STAT3 is constitutively expressed.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
