Results/methodology: While hydrazone (2-4) and azine (5-13) derivatives showed an improvement in their MDRreversal activities against the breast cancer resistance protein, carbohydrazides14-19 revealed an enhancement in MDR reversal activity toward the multidrugresistance protein 1.CONCLUSION: The observed activities, together with pharmacophoric analysis andmolecular docking studies, identified the spatial orientation of the substituentsas a key structural feature toward a possible mechanism by which naringeninderivatives may reverse MDR in cancer.DOI: 10.4155/fmc-2017-0228 PMID: 29570361
