In thiscase report, we present a 36-year-old woman with signs, symptoms and conventionalimaging features of malignancy who underwent breast MRI. On diffusion-weightedimaging (DWI), profoundly low apparent diffusion coefficient values were adistinguishing sign of breast abscess from necrotic breast cancer, and helpedmanage the patient conservatively. We present a companion case of necrotic breasttumour highlighting significant differences in DWI.Â© BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article)2018.
