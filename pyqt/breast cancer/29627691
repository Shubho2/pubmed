Cell morphology was visualized afterGiemsa-May-Grunwald staining. DNA content, phosphatidylserine externalization andmitochondrial depolarization were measured by flow cytometry. Genotoxicity wasassessed by Comet assay.RESULTS: 5-(2-Bromo-5-methoxybenzylidene)-thiazolidine-2,4-dione (5) presentedthe most potent cytotoxicity, especially against NCI-H292 lung cancer cell line, with IC50 value of 1.26μg/mL after 72h incubation. None of the compounds werecytotoxic to PBMC. After 48h incubation, externalization of phosphatidylserine,mitochondrial depolarization, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation andmorphological alterations consistent with apoptosis were observed in NCI-H292cells treated with compound (5). In addition, compound (5) also inducedgenotoxicity in NCI-H292 cells (2.8-fold increase in damage index compared to thenegative control), but not in PBMC.CONCLUSION: Compound 5 presented selective cytotoxic and genotoxic activityagainst pulmonary carcinoma (NCI-H292 cells).Copyright © 2017 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.
