We review our institutional series todetermine factors predictive of local failure.METHODS: In a total of 39 consecutive patients with brain metastases treated fromAugust 2011 to August 2016, 43 surgical beds were treated with HSRT in three orfive fractions. All treatments were completed on a robotic radiosurgery platform using the 6D Skull tracking system. Volumetric MRIs from before and after surgerywere used for radiation planning. A 2-mm PTV margin was used around the contouredsurgical bed and resection margins; these were reviewed by the radiationoncologist and neurosurgeon. Lower total doses were prescribed based on proximityto critical structures or if prior radiation treatments were given. Local controlin this study is defined as no volumetric MRI evidence of recurrence of tumorwithin the high dose radiation volume. Statistics were calculated using JMP Prov13.RESULTS: Of the 43 surgical beds analyzed, 23 were from NSCLC, 5 were frombreast, 4 from melanoma, 5 from esophagus, and 1 each from SCLC, sarcoma, colon, renal, rectal, and unknown primary. Ten were treated with three fractions withmedian dose 24 Gy and 33 were treated with five fractions with median dose27.5 Gy using an every other day fractionation. There were no reported grade 3 orhigher toxicities. Median follow up was 212 days after completion of radiation.10 (23%) surgical beds developed local failure with a median time to failure of148 days. All but three patients developed new brain metastases outside of thetreated field and were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brainradiation and/or chemotherapy. Five patients (13%) developed leptomeningealdisease. With a median follow up of 226 days, 30 Gy/5 fx was associated with the best local control (93%) with only 1 local failure. A lower total dose in fivefractions (ie 27.5 or 25 Gy) had a local control rate of 70%. For three fraction SBRT, local control was 100% using a dose of 27 Gy in three fractions (follow up was > 600 days) and 71% if 24 Gy in three fractions was used. A higher totalbiologically equivalent dose (BED10) was statistically significant for improvedlocal control (p = 0.04) with a threshold BED10 ≥ 48 associated with better localcontrol.CONCLUSIONS: HSRT after surgical resection for brain metastasis is well toleratedand has improved local control with BED10 ≥ 48 (30 Gy/5 fx and 27 Gy/3 fx).Additional study is warranted.DOI: 10.1007/s11060-018-2885-6 PMID: 29749569
