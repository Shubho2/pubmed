Forty-five double-equivocal carcinomas were subjected to Prosignaanalysis. Twenty-seven cases were investigated for the expression of genes found to be differentially expressed between estrogen receptor(ER)-positive/HER2-positive (N=22) and ER-positive/HER2-negative (N=22) controlcases. Twenty-nine of the 45 cases were also analyzed by targeted sequencingusing a panel of 14 genes. We then explored the pathologic complete responserates in an independent series of double-equivocal carcinoma patients treatedwith trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy. All cases were ER-positive, with a meanKi67 of 28%. Double-equivocal carcinomas were predominantly luminal B (76%); 9cases (20%) were luminal A, and 2 cases (4%) HER2-enriched. The majority (73%)showed a high risk of recurrence by Prosigna, even when the carcinomas were small(<2 cm), node-negative/micrometastatic, and/or grade 2. Double-equivocalcarcinomas showed TP53 (6/29, 20%), PIK3CA (3/29, 10%), HER2 (1/29, 3%), andMAP2K4 (1/29, 3%) mutations. Compared with grade-matchedER-positive/HER2-negative breast carcinomas from METABRIC, double-equivocalcarcinomas harbored more frequently TP53 mutations and less frequently PIK3CAmutations (P<0.05). No significant differences were observed with grade-matchedER-positive/HER2-positive carcinomas. Lower pathologic complete response rateswere observed in double-equivocal compared with HER2-positive patients (10% vs.60%, P=0.009). Double-equivocal carcinomas are preferentially luminal B and show a high risk of recurrence. A subset of these tumors can be labeled asHER2-enriched by transcriptomic analysis. HER2 mutations can be identified inHER2 double-equivocal cases.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work providedit is properly cited.
