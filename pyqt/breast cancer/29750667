Her-2/Neu gene isroutinely assessed for all breast cancer patients primarily byimmunohistochemistry. At National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University,Flourescence In Situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of Her-2/Neu gene is carriedout for Her-2/Neu score 2 and for some cases of score 3 (particularly thoseassessed outside NCI). The test is performed essentially on the primary tumor.However, some situations require testing on corresponding lymph node metastases. There is a debate about the concordance between Her-2/Neu status in the primarytumor and synchronous lymph node metastases in various studies.AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to test for the concordance betweenHer-2/Neu status in the primary breast tumor and corresponding axillary nodalmetastases.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study in which FISH analysis ofHer-2/Neu was carried out simultaneously on archived material of 50 casespreviously diagnosed as invasive duct carcinoma and the corresponding nodalmetastases from the Pathology Department, NCI.RESULTS: There was complete concordance between Her-2 status in the primary tumorand the corresponding axillary lymph node metastatic deposits in which Her-2 was amplified in 44% of the studied cohort of Egyptian patients.CONCLUSIONS: Her-2/Neu gene assessed by FISH analysis on synchronous lymph nodemetastases is strongly correlated with the primary tumor. Hence, it is justified to carry out the Her-2/Neu test on synchronous lymph nodes to decide on whetherto carry out anti-Her-2/Neu target therapy. Further studies on other metastaticsites is recommended.DOI: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000591 PMID: 29750667
