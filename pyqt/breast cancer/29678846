Deregulation of HGF/METsignaling is reported as a prognostic marker for tumorigenesis, early stageinvasion, and metastasis which is associated with poor clinical outcome in breastcancer patients. The aim of the present study was to further investigate theprognostic or predictive value of MACC1 expression in breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the MACC1 expression in 105 primary breastcancer samples by Western-Blot analysis and immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: A significant correlation of high MACC1 expression with shorterdisease-free survival was found within the group of lymph-node-negative patients.Additionally, an association of high MACC1 expression and shorter disease-freesurvival was observed within estrogen receptor positive tumors and patientswithout adjuvant chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: Our results support a biologic role and potentially open theperspective for the use of MACC1 as a prognostic marker for treatment decision inbreast cancer patients.Â© 2018 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.PMID: 29678846
