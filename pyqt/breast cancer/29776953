To facilitate interpretation of thegenomic complexity of circulating tumor DNA in advanced, treated cancer patients,we developed methods to identify cfDNA copy-number driver alterations and cfDNAclonality.Results: Patterns and prevalence of cfDNA alterations in major drivergenes for non-small cell lung, breast, and colorectal cancer largelyrecapitulated those from tumor tissue sequencing compendia (The Cancer GenomeAtlas and COSMIC; r = 0.90-0.99), with the principal differences in alterationprevalence being due to patient treatment. This highly sensitive cfDNA sequencingassay revealed numerous subclonal tumor-derived alterations, expected as a resultof clonal evolution, but leading to an apparent departure from mutual exclusivityin treatment-naïve tumors. Upon applying novel cfDNA clonality and copy-numberdriver identification methods, robust mutual exclusivity was observed amongpredicted truncal driver cfDNA alterations (FDR = 5 × 10-7 for EGFR and ERBB2),in effect distinguishing tumor-initiating alterations from secondary alterations.Treatment-associated resistance, including both novel alterations and parallelevolution, was common in the cfDNA cohort and was enriched in patients withtargetable driver alterations (>18.6% patients).Conclusions: Together, theseretrospective analyses of a large cfDNA sequencing data set reveal subclonalstructures and emerging resistance in advanced solid tumors.
