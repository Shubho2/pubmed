However, the plasmaexpression of lncRNA BLACAT1 and its clinical value in patients with papillarythyroid cancer (PTC) remain unknown.Methods: The expression profile of BLACAT1 in 87 PTC patients (case group) and 36patients with nodular goiter (control group) were investigated by qRT-PCR. TheKaplan-Meier method was used for RFS curves, and the univariate survivaldifferences were analyzed by the log-rank test.Results: BLACAT1 expression was downregulated in the plasma of case groupcompared with control group (P = 0.003). We also found that low plasma BLACAT1expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (P < 0.001).Multivariate analysis showed that BLACAT1 was an independent risk factor forlymph node metastasis and gender (P < 0.05). The area under the ROC curve forBLACAT1 was 0.825 in LNM prediction (P < 0.001).Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that BLACAT1 could act as a possiblesuppressor gene in PTC and may serve as a potential biomarker for prognosisprediction of PTC.DOI: 10.1186/s12935-018-0544-9 PMCID: PMC5870533PMID: 29599647
