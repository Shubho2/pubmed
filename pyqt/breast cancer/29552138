China.Breast cancer suppressor candidate-1 (BCSC-1) is a candidate tumor suppressorgene that was identified recently. Decreased levels of BCSC-1 have been detected in a variety of cancer types in previous studies. Matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-14 is a membrane-type MMP that plays an important role in tumor progressionand prognosis. Previous research has indicated that MMP-14 is highly expressed indifferent cancer types and promotes tumor invasion or metastasis by remodelingthe extracellular matrix. However, there have been few reports on BCSC-1 andMMP-14 in human breast cancer in recent years. In the present study, theassociation of BCSC-1 and MMP-14 with human breast cancer was investigated. Theimmunohistochemical analysis results revealed reduced expression of BCSC-1 andoverexpression of MMP-14 in breast cancer tissues compared with adjacent normalbreast tissues. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses also showed that BCSC-1 was expressed at significantly lower levels, and thatMMP-14 was expressed at significantly higher levels in breast cancer tissuescompared with healthy breast tissue. Furthermore, decreased expression of BCSC-1 and overexpression of MMP-14 were associated with tumor cellular differentiation,lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. A correlational analysis betweenBCSC-1 and MMP-14 was also conducted, and the results indicated a negativecorrelation between the two. In conclusion, the current findings indicate thatBCSC-1 is downregulated, while MMP-14 is overexpressed in human breast cancer.These two genes may play important roles during the process of human breastcancer development.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7972 PMCID: PMC5840690PMID: 29552138
