Surgeries werecategorized into five modalities: breast-conserving surgery (BCS), simplemastectomy (SM), modified radical mastectomy (MRM), radical mastectomy (RM), and extensive radical mastectomy (ERM).RESULTS: In total, 38 471 (86.84%) breast cancer patients underwent surgery:22.64% BCS, 8.22% SM, 63.97% MRM, 4.24% RM, and 0.93% ERM. Older patients (> 60) underwent surgery more frequently than younger patients (< 60). The proportion ofpatients who underwent BCS was highest in the age ≥ 80 (39.24%) and < 40 (28.69%)subgroups and in patients with papillary carcinoma (35.48%), and lowest in theage 60- subgroup (18.17%) and in patients with Paget's disease (19.05%). SM wasmost frequently performed in patients with Paget's disease (29.00%), and MRM for ductal (64.99%), and lobular (63.78%) carcinomas. During the study period, theproportion of patients who underwent MRM dropped by 29.04%, SM and BCS increased from 15.78% and 30.83%, respectively, and NACT increased in all subgroups,particularly in patients with lymph node involvement (26.72%).CONCLUSIONS: Surgical modalities varied significantly by age and histologicgroup. The use of BCS and SM increased dramatically, while MRM declinedsignificantly. The proportion of patients treated with NACT has increasedsignificantly, especially in patients with lymph node involvement.© 2018 The Authors.
