Though the number of long-term breastcancer survivors has been increasing, recent improvements in 10-year survivalhave not been reported. Moreover, the degree of improvement according to age and disease stage remains unclear.METHODS: We calculated long-term survival using data on breast cancer diagnosedfrom 1993 through 2006 from six prefectural population-based cancer registries inJapan. The recent increase in 10-year relative survival was assessed by comparingthe results of period analysis in 2002-2006 with the results of cohort analysisin 1993-1997. We also conducted stratified analyses by age group (15-34, 35-49,50-69, and 70-99 years) and disease stage (localized, regional, and distant).RESULTS: A total of 63,348 patients were analysed. Ten-year relative survivalimproved by 2.4% (76.9% vs 79.3%) from 1993 through 2006. By age and stage,10-year relative survival clearly improved in the age 35-49 years (+2.9%; 78.1%vs 81.0%), 50-69 years (+2.8%; 75.2% vs 78.0%) and regional disease (+3.4%; 64.9%vs 68.3%). In contrast, the degree of improvement was small in the age 15-34years (+0.1%; 68.2% vs 68.3%), 70-99 years (+1.0%; 87.6% vs 88.6%), localizeddisease (+1.1%; 92.6% vs 93.7%) and distant metastasis (+0.9%; 13.8% vs 14.7%).CONCLUSIONS: These population-based cancer registry data show that 10-yearrelative survival improved 2.4% over this period in Japan. By age and stage,improvement in the age 15-34 years and distant metastasis was very small, whichsuggests the need for new therapeutic strategies in these patients.DOI: 10.2188/jea.JE20170103 PMID: 29479003
