In the presentstudy, we evaluated observed and the expected incidence of common cancers inChaharmahal and Bakhtiari province.Materials and Methods: This study is a Secondary data analysis. All data aboutpathology-based cancer registration (Cancer diagnosis was based on pathologicallaboratory, ICD-O2) in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in Southwestern Iran in2010-2014 was used. By dividing the number of registered cases of each cancer in every age group into the total observed cancers in that age group, the observedratio of each cancer in that age group was calculated. Then, using the proposedcoefficients Parkin and age-standardized cancer ratio method, the expected ratiosin each age group, were calculated.Results: In 5 years study, 2918 new cases of cancer were recorded. Out of them,1735 (59.46%) were male. The annual average total occurrence of all cancers inthis province was 68.2/100,000 populations. The observed incidence ratios ofcommon cancers, including stomach, breast, colorectal, thyroid, lymph nodes,ovaries, gall bladder, the bladder and the brain, were 0.11, 0.12, 0.09, 0.06,0.02, 0.03, 0.01, 0.08, and 0.05, respectively. The expected incidence ratios of above-mentioned cancers are 0.11, 0.13, 0.1, 0.06, 0.02, 0.03, 0.01, 0.08, and0.05, respectively. Based on observed (O) and expected (E) comparison, breast andcolorectal cancer had higher incidence than expected ratio.Conclusion: Our results showed that in our area, treatment programs and healthplans should focus on cancer registration, especially on common cancers andreevaluate breast and colorectal cancer occurrence. Therefore, the plan for thecontrol and prevention of this cancer must be a high priority for healthpolicymakers.DOI: 10.4103/jrms.JRMS_788_17 PMCID: PMC5813294PMID: 29456561
