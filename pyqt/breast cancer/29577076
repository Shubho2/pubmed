Achieving a pathologic completeresponse (pCR) provides important prognostic information, and, especially inTNBC, is considered a surrogate endpoint for event-free survival. Thus, manyneoadjuvant studies in TNBC focus on this as a primary endpoint, and suchinformation may be used for accelerated US Food and Drug Administration approval.Current controversies in the field include: (1) the role of platinum-basedcompounds; (2) the optimal chemotherapy backbone; and (3) the benefits ofadditional therapy after surgery. Conflicting results of 2 major studies addingcarboplatin to NACT have highlighted the need to balance potential benefits todisease outcomes against increased toxicity. While the PROGECT study suggestsefficacy of a nonanthracycline-containing regimen, this is observational data,and evidence in the form of a clinical trial remains to be seen. Data surroundingoptimal taxane use support the use of nab-paclitaxel in place of paclitaxel inlimited clinical situations. Although bevacizumab may increase pCR rates, thishas not translated into survival benefit. Capecitabine shows promise in patients who have not achieved pCR after NACT. The neoadjuvant setting remains animportant model for drug development. This review will focus on the mostimportant and most current neoadjuvant trials in women with TNBC.PMCID: PMC5865448PMID: 29577076
