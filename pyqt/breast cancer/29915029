However, the molecularpathways that control ROS signaling relevant to metastasis are little studied.Here, we identify SIRT3, a mitochondrial deacetylase, as a regulator of cellmigration via its control of ROS signaling. We find that, although mitochondriaare present at the leading edge of migrating cells, SIRT3 expression isdown-regulated during migration, resulting in elevated ROS levels. ThisSIRT3-mediated control of ROS represses Src oxidation and attenuates focaladhesion kinase (FAK) activation. SIRT3 overexpression inhibits migration andmetastasis in breast cancer cells. Finally, in human breast cancers, SIRT3expression is inversely correlated with metastatic outcome and Src/FAK signaling.Our results reveal a role for SIRT3 in cell migration, with importantimplications for breast cancer progression.Copyright Â© 2018 the Author(s).
