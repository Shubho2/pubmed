Here, we demonstrated that lncRNA-PRLB (progression-associated lncRNA inbreast cancer) was upregulated in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancercell lines. Further evaluation verified that lncRNA-PRLB was positivelycorrelated with the extent of metastasis, and its expression was correlated with shorter survival time of breast cancer patients. We identified microRNAmiR-4766-5p as an inhibitory target of lncRNA-PRLB. Both lncRNA-PRLBoverexpression and miR-4766-5p knockdown could remarkably enhance cell growth,metastasis, and chemoresistance. We also determined that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was aninhibitory target of miR-4766-5p, and that SIRT1 was inhibited by bothlncRNA-PRLB knockdown and miR-4766-5p overexpression. Significantly, we foundthat the promotion of cell proliferation and metastasis, the acquisition ofchemoresistance, and the increased expression of SIRT1 induced by lncRNA-PRLBoverexpression could be partly abrogated by ectopic expression of miR-4766-5p.Taken together, our findings indicated that lncRNA could regulate the progressionand chemoresistance of breast cancer via modulating the expression levels ofmiR-4766-5p and SIRT1, which may have a pivotal role in breast cancer treatmentand prognosis prediction.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0582-1 PMCID: PMC5948209PMID: 29752439
