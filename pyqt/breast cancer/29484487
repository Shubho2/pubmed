This study investigated their antitumoral effects 'per se', using a mathematical model validated on experimental data.METHODS: OLN were prepared and characterized either in vitro or in vivo. TUBOcells, established from a lobular carcinoma of a BALB-neuT mouse, wereinvestigated following 48 h of incubation in the absence/presence of differentconcentrations of OLN. OLN internalization, cell viability, necrosis, apoptosis, cell cycle and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were checked as describedin the Method section. In vivo tumor growth was evaluated after subcutaneoustransplant in BALB/c mice of TUBO cells either without treatment or after 24 hincubation with 10% v/v OLN.RESULTS: OLN showed sizes of about 350 nm and a positive surface charge (45 mV). Dose-dependent TUBO cell death through ROS-triggered apoptosis following OLNinternalization was detected. A mathematical model predicting the effects of OLN uptake was validated on both in vitro and in vivo results.CONCLUSIONS: Due to their intrinsic toxicity OLN might be considered an adjuvant tool suitable to deliver their therapeutic cargo intracellularly and may beproposed as promising combined delivery system.DOI: 10.1007/s11095-018-2371-z PMID: 29484487
