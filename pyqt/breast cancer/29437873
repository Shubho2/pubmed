E6201 is a potent synthetic small-molecule MEK inhibitor. Thepurpose of this study was to evaluate brain distribution of E6201, and examinethe impact of active efflux transport at the blood-brain barrier on the centralnervous system (CNS) exposure of E6201. In vitro studies utilizing transfectedMadin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells indicate that E6201 is not asubstrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp).In vivo studies also suggest a minimal involvement of P-gp and Bcrp in E6201'sbrain distribution. The total concentrations in brain were higher than in plasma,resulting in a brain-to-plasma AUC ratio (Kp) of 2.66 in wild-type mice. Thebrain distribution was modestly enhanced in Mdr1a/b-/-, Bcrp1-/-, andMdr1a/b-/-Bcrp1-/- knockout mice. The nonspecific binding of E6201 was higher in brain compared with plasma. However, free-drug concentrations in brain following 40 mg/kg intravenous dose reach levels that exceed reported in vitro half-maximalinhibitory concentration (IC50) values, suggesting that E6201 may be efficacious in inhibiting MEK-driven brain tumors. The brain distribution characteristics of E6201 make it an attractive targeted agent for clinical testing in MBM,glioblastoma, and other CNS tumors that may be effectively targeted withinhibition of MEK signaling.Copyright Â© 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/dmd.117.079194 PMCID: PMC5896365 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29437873
