Patients were categorized into three groups; 1) triple-negative breastcancers (n = 48); 2) ER-positive tumors (n = 128) and 3) HER2-positive tumors(n = 58). Mean tumor stiffness was evaluated by virtual touch tissue imaging(VTI) and virtual touch tissue quantification (VTQ) and quantified as bothqualitative scores (1-5) and shear wave velocity (SWV) (m/s). The relationshipbetween mean SWV and tumor parameters, including tumor size, tumor type,histologic grade and lymph node status, were investigated using multiple linearregression.RESULTS: Triple-negative tumor were more likely to have a large invasive size(p = 0.002), high histological grade (p < 0.001), lymph node involvement(p = 0.022) and strong ki-67 expression (p < 0.001). The highest mean SWV valuewere recorded in triple-negative tumors (7.36 m/s±1.83), followed by HER2+ tumors(6.65 m/s±2.26) and ER+ tumors (6.60 m/s±2.35) (p = 0.122). Triple-negativetumors were also associated with increased stiffness than ER+ tumors and HER2+tumors (p = 0.016), as measured by qualitative VTI scores. Tumor size wasindependently associated with mean SWV value on adjusted regression (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Triple-negative breast cancer is associated with high stiffnessscores and SWV in ARFI. The latter may be considered a useful complementary tool in evaluation of triple-negative breast cancer.DOI: 10.3233/CH-170363 PMID: 29843225
