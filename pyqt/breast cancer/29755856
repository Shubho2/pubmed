Calcium and vitamin D are the basic treatment forosteoporosis. Nonetheless, they do not effectively reduce the incidences offracture. Currently approved treatments for osteoporosis include selectiveestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), bisphosphonates, denosumab, teriparatide,calcitonin and others. However, the appearance of some adverse effects including atypical fracture and breast cancer has limited long-term treatments abovementioned. Therefore, treatment decision should be made on an individual basis,taking into account the relative benefits and risks in different patients. Bonemetabolism test helps to assess the patient's condition, which may ultimatelylead to therapeutic options and better clinical outcomes.PMCID: PMC5944817PMID: 29755856
