In additionto play important roles in cell adhesion, migration and invasion, PAI-1 has been reported to induce tumor vascularization and thus promote cell dissemination and tumor metastasis. Furthermore, there are many tumor promoting factors involved inthe modulation of PAI-1 expression and activity, which will strengthen thepro-tumorigenic roles of PAI-1. Undoubtedly, PAI-1 may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention of specific cancer treatment. In fact, some PAI-1inhibitors are currently being evaluated in cancer therapy, which may bedeveloped to new antitumor agents in the future.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
