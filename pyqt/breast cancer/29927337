We examine theaccuracy of tomosynthesis in measuring tumor size relative to pathology andcompared with other tests. Areas covered: A systematic literature searchidentified studies of tomosynthesis in estimating the size of newly diagnosedbreast cancers. Descriptive analyses were performed due to heterogeneity inpatients, technology, and methods between studies. Eight studies were eligible(678 patients). Mean differences (MDs) between measurements(tomosynthesis-pathology) were generally small; overestimation (MDs of 1-3 mm)and underestimation (-1 mm) were reported. Limits of agreement (LOA) rangedbetween ±10 mm and ±28 mm. MDs did not differ in high and low breast densities.Large underestimation (-11 mm) and wide LOA (±41 mm) were reported for invasivelobular carcinoma. MDs and LOA were lower for tomosynthesis than mammography, butdifferences between tests were small. Expert commentary: Although tomosynthesisis a promising technology for assessing breast cancer size, few studies in thatcontext had limitations (small sample sizes, heterogeneous populations, andtechnologies). Studies using current technology and appropriate statisticalmethods are required to establish the magnitude of improvement in measurementaccuracy, and patients for whom the test may be of most benefit.DOI: 10.1080/17434440.2018.1491306 PMID: 29927337
