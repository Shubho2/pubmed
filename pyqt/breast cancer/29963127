China.The B7 family, the most common family of secondary signaling molecules, consists of eight cell-surface proteins, which regulate the T-cell mediated immuneresponse by delivering co-inhibitory or co-stimulatory signals through theircorresponding ligands. Among them, natural killer cell cytotoxicity receptor 3ligand 1 (NCR3LG1, also known as B7H6) has been reported as a new member, and is involved in tumor progression of various types of human cancer. However, the roleof B7H6 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unknown. In the presentstudy, western blotting was performed to determine the protein expression levels of B7H6 in a normal mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A), non-TNBC breastcancer cell lines (MCF-7 and AU565) and TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 andMDA-MB-468). B7H6 was knocked down using small interfering RNA, and an MTT assay was performed to determine proliferation ability, flow cytometry was used toanalyze apoptosis, and Transwell and wound-healing assays were performed tomeasure migration ability. Expression of proliferation-associated proteins (SMAD family member 4 and Î²-catenin) and apoptosis-associated proteins (BCL2 associatedX, BCL2 apoptosis regulator and caspase-3) were analyzed by western blotting. Theresults demonstrated that B7H6 was highly expressed in TNBC cells, and thatknockdown of B7H6 inhibited cell proliferation and migration, and promotedapoptosis. Furthermore, the results revealed that proliferation andapoptosis-associated proteins were altered in the B7H6-knockdown MDA-MB-231cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that B7H6 may havesignificant roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis andmigration of TNBC cells.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8689 PMCID: PMC6019890PMID: 29963127
