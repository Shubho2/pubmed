The tumour remains the most researched, read and practiced uponaround the Globe. The treatment has substantially improved breast cancer related outcomes, both for early as well as late stages with substantial improvements in disease free and overall survival. Therapeutic decisions not only rest onclinical & tumour characteristics, but also with the evolution of molecularbiology and tissue microarray intrinsic sub-types have been found. Attempts arebeing made to translate therapy from genomic architecture of individual breastcancer. This facilitates customization of treatment avoiding un-necessarytoxicity, costs and inconvenience. Optimizing treatment based on individualbreast biology seems logical and allows unifying treatment. The paper reviewsliterature, incorporate updates and also describes immunohistochemistry basedmolecular classification: which are found simple to adapt, record, present andsubsequently manage, summarizing clinical practices in management of thesepatients.PMID: 29938432
