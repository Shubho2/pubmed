Giventhat p95HER2 levels correlate with total HER2 expression levels, which conferbetter outcomes, we sought to evaluate the p95HER2/HER2 ratio in the NorthCentral Cancer Treatment Group N0337 and N98-32-52 trials.Experimental Design:The HERmark assay and VeraTag technology (Monogram Biosciences) were used tomeasure total HER2 and p95HER2 expression levels in 91 patient samples.Results:In the multivariate model, increasing total HER2 level was significantlyassociated with longer (OS; HR, 0.33; P = 0.002) and decreasing p95HER2 level wassignificantly associated with longer OS (HR, 4.2; P = 0.01). Total HER2expression level was significantly associated with longer progression-freesurvival (PFS) (HR, 0.57; P = 0.04), whereas p95HER2 level was not (HR, 1.7; P = 0.25). However, there was a positive association between p95HER2 and total HER2expression levels (R2 = 0.48; P < 0.001). Consistent with our hypothesis, theratio of p95HER2/HER2 was significantly associated with worsening PFS (HR, 1.7; P= 0.04) and OS (HR, 2.8; P = 0.002). Patients with the highest tertile ofp95HER2/HER2 values had significantly less favorable PFS (HR, 1.8; P = 0.06) and OS (HR, 2.3; P = 0.02).Conclusions: A high p95HER2/HER2 ratio identified patientswith metastatic breast cancer with poor outcomes on trastuzumab-based therapies. Further investigation of the p95HER2/HER2 ratio as a potential prognostic orpredictive biomarker for HER2-targeted therapy is warranted.
