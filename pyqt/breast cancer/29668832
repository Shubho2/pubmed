In addition, interindividual analyses showed thatwomen who engaged in more MVPA across the study period had lower concentrationsof CRP compared to women who engaged in less MVPA (β = -.24, p = .006).Conclusions: MVPA in breast cancer patients is consistently associated with lowerCRP concentrations over time. Interventions may target individual MVPA earlyafter diagnosis to mitigate CRP levels in breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1093/abm/kax010 PMID: 29668832
