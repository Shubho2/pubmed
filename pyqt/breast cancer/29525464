The primary aim was to evaluate the management of positivemargins after initial lumpectomy in elderly women.METHODS: Women ≥50 y who underwent lumpectomy for stage I-III tumors wereidentified. Tumor and treatment characteristics were collected across twosubgroups: young (50-69 y) and elderly (≥70 y). Univariate comparisons were done using chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. A multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with reoperation. Incidence of overallrecurrence was compared between young and elderly women by plotting thecumulative incidence function of overall recurrence and death without recurrence.RESULTS: Of 1670 women identified, 29.5% were elderly. Compared to young women,tumors in elderly patients were more frequently invasive lobular carcinoma,larger, low grade and lymphovascular negative. Positive margins were less common in elderly than young women (10.8% versus 16.2%, unadjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI0.42-0.86). Compared to young women, elderly women were less likely to undergoreoperation (84.9% versus 100%, p < 0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (5.7% versus46.6%, p < 0.0001), and adjuvant radiation therapy (69.8% versus 83.9%,p = 0.04). Five-year disease free survival (DFS) was similar between age groups(86% versus 86%, p = 0.8).CONCLUSIONS: Elderly women with positive margins after initial lumpectomy weretreated differently than younger women as shown by a lower rate of reoperationand adjuvant radiation therapy. Despite these treatment variations there was noimpact on overall recurrence and DFS.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
