However, the current knowledge ofCDKN1C in breast cancer remains obscure. In the present study, we demonstratedthat CDKN1C was dramatically downregulated in breast cancer compared with normal tissues by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotand two public data portals: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncominedatasets. Moreover, the expression of CDKN1C was correlated with age and tumorsize in the TCGA cohort containing 708 cases of breast cancer. Low expression of CDKN1C was significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) in the TCGAcohort and validated cohort composed of 1402 patients. Multivariate Coxregression analysis indicated that CDKN1C was an independent prognostic factorfor worse OS (HR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.09-2.89, p = 0.020). Furthermore, gene setenrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that CDKN1C was significantly correlated withgene signatures involving DNA repair, cell cycle, glycolysis, adipogenesis, andtwo critical signaling pathways mTORC1 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR. In conclusion, our datasuggested an essential role of CDKN1C in the tumorgenesis of breast cancer.Targeting CDKN1C may be a promising strategy for anticancer therapeutics.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
