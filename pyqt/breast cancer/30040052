Materials and Methods A total of 3050 patients from 17 public breastcancer data sets containing IHC marker receptor status (estrogenreceptor/progesterone receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2])and their molecular classification (basal-like, HER2-enriched, luminal A or B)were analyzed. Diagnostic accuracy and concordance as measured with the κstatistic were calculated between the IHC and molecular classifications.Simulations were performed to assess the relationship between accuracy ofimaging-based IHC markers to predict molecular classification. A simulation wasperformed to examine effects of misclassification of molecular type on patientsurvival. Results Accuracies of intrinsic subtypes based on IHC subtype were71.7% (luminal A), 53.7% (luminal B), 64.8% (HER2-enriched), and 81.7%(basal-like). The κ agreement was fair (κ = 0.36) for luminal A and HER2-enrichedsubtypes, good (κ = 0.65) for the basal-like subtype, and poor (κ = 0.09) for theluminal B subtypes. Introduction of image misclassification by simulation loweredimage-true subtype accuracies and κ values. Simulation analysis showed thatmisclassification caused survival differences between luminal A and basal-likesubtypes to decrease. Conclusion There is poor concordance betweentriple-receptor status and intrinsic molecular subtype in breast cancer, arguing against their use in the design of prognostic genomic-based image biomarkers.© RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018171118 PMID: 30040052
