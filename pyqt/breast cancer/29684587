However, if and how mechanical signals affect metastasis or therapy response remains poorly understood. We previously found that the channel-kinaseTRPM7, a regulator of cellular tension implicated in mechano-sensory processes,is required for breast cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show thatTRPM7 contributes to maintaining a mesenchymal phenotype in breast cancer cellsby tensional regulation of the EMT transcription factor SOX4. The functionalconsequences of SOX4 knockdown closely mirror those produced by TRPM7 knockdown. By traction force measurements, we demonstrate that TRPM7 reduces cytoskeletaltension through inhibition of myosin II activity. Moreover, we show that SOX4expression and downstream mesenchymal markers are inversely regulated bycytoskeletal tension and matrix rigidity. Overall, our results identify SOX4 as atranscription factor that is uniquely sensitive to cellular tension and indicate that TRPM7 may contribute to breast cancer progression by tensional regulation ofSOX4.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).
