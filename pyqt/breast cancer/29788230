Weinvestigated associations between baseline TIL percentage and either pCR or EFSafter adjusting for clinicopathological characteristics using logistic and Coxregression models, respectively. To understand TIL biology, we evaluatedassociations between baseline TILs and baseline tumor gene expression data (800gene set by NanoString) in a subset of 173 patients. All statistical tests weretwo-sided.Results: Among the patients with measurable TILs at baseline, the median levelwas 14.1% (interquartile range = 7.1%-32.4%). After adjusting forclinicopathological characteristics, baseline percentage TIL was not associatedwith pCR (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for every 10-percentage unit increase in TILs= 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95 to 1.31, P = .17). At a medianfollow-up of 4.7 years, for every increase in baseline TILs of 10%, there was a25% reduction in the hazard for an EFS event (aOR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.56 to 1.00, P = .05) after adjusting for baseline clinicopathological characteristics andpCR. Additionally, genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition,angiogenesis, and T-cell inhibition such as SNAIL1, ZEB1, NOTCH3, and B7-H3 were statistically significantly inversely correlated with percentage TIL.Conclusions: Baseline TIL percentage provides independent prognostic information in patients treated with trastuzumab/pertuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.However, further validation is required.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy076 PMID: 29788230
