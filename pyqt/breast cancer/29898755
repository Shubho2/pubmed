Numerous studies have been conducted to seek moleculartargets to treat TNBC effectively, but chemotherapy is still the main choice for patients with TNBC. We have previously presented evidence of the important roles of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) in TNBC tumorgrowth and metastasis. These experiments highlighted the importance of thecrosstalk between cancer cells and stromal lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in tumor growth and metastasis.METHODS: We examined the viability and migration of MDA-MB-231-LN, SUM149, andSUM159 cells co-cultured with LECs when treated with maraviroc (CCR5 inhibitor)and tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor antibody). To assess the anti-tumor effectsof the combination of these two drugs in an athymic nude mouse model,MDA-MB-231-LN cells were implanted in the mammary fat pad and maraviroc (8 mg/kg,orally daily) and cMR16-1 (murine surrogate of the anti-IL-6R antibody, 10 mg/kg,IP, 3 days a week) were administrated for 5 weeks and effects on tumor growth andthoracic metastasis were measured.RESULTS: In this study, we used maraviroc and tocilizumab to confirm that IL-6and CCL5 signaling are key pathways promoting TNBC cell proliferation andmigration. Further, in a xenograft mouse model, we showed that tumor growth wasdramatically inhibited by cMR16-1, the mouse version of the anti-IL6R antibody.The combination of maraviroc and cMR16-1 caused significant reduction of TNBCtumor growth compared to the single agents. Significantly, the combination ofmaraviroc and cMR16-1 abrogated thoracic metastasis.CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings show that IL-6 and CCL5 signaling,which promote crosstalk between TNBC and lymphatic vessels, are key enhancers of TNBC tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that adrug combination inhibiting these pathways may be a promising therapy for TNBCpatients.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0981-3 PMCID: PMC6000947PMID: 29898755
