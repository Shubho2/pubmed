These cells are suggested to be associatedwith therapeutic failure, and therefore they remain as an important issue in thisregard. We report the cases of two breast cancer patients diagnosed with rapidcutaneous metastases during adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy after curativemastectomy. For elucidating a relationship between CSCs and resistance tochemotherapy, we evaluated primary tumor and metastatic cutaneous lesions by CSC markers in immunohistochemical stains (CD44+/CD24- and ALDH-1). EitherCD44+/CD24- or ALDH-1 expression increased compared to primary breast cancerduring chemotherapy. This case report shows that CD44+/CD24- or ALDH-1 expressionin primary or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer may be associated with rapidonset chemoresistance.DOI: 10.21037/sci.2018.03.04 PMCID: PMC5897689PMID: 29682514
