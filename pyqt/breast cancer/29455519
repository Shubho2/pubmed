This therapeutic system can specifically self-target 4T1 breast cancer cells by exploiting L-apoferritinreceptor SCARA 5, avoiding the nonspecific binding or aggregation ofnanoparticles due to the chemical functionalization for targeting. Thecharacteristics of AFt were utilized for the simultaneous delivery of anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) and photosensitizer rose bengal (RB). RB exhibitedefficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which can be applied tophotodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, the AFt nanocage was prone to undergoing peptidebackbone cleavage when oxidized by ROS. Therefore, by combining the intrinsicpH-responsive property of AFt, the dual ROS/pH-responsive system was developed.The time and location of drug release can be controlled by the combination ofinternal and external stimulus, which avoids the incomplete drug release undersingle stimulus response. The drug release rate increased significantly (from26.1% to 92.0%) under low-pH condition (pH 5.0) and laser irradiation. More DOXfrom AFt entered the nucleus and killed the tumor cells, and the cell inhibition rate was up to ∼83% (DOX concentration: 5 μg/mL) after 48 h incubation. Inaddition, the biodistribution and the in vivo antitumor efficacy (within 14 dtreatment) of the nanosystem were investigated in 4T1 breast cancer BALB/c mice. The results indicated that the system is a promising therapeutic agent involving ROS/pH dual response, self-targeting, and chemo-photodynamic therapy.DOI: 10.1021/acs.biomac.8b00012 PMID: 29455519
