Box 24144, Doha,Qatar. dib2015@qatar-med.cornell.edu.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is among the most notorious types of breast cancer, the treatment of which does not give consistent results due to theabsence of the three receptors (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor(PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as well as high amount of molecular variability. Drug resistance also contributes to treatmentunresponsiveness. We studied differentially expressed genes, their biologicalroles, as well as pathways from RNA-Seq datasets of two different TNBCdrug-resistant cell lines of Basal B subtype SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 treated withdrugs JQ1 and Dexamethasone, respectively, to elucidate the mechanism of drugresistance. RNA sequencing(RNA-Seq) data analysis was done using edgeR which isan efficient program for determining the most significant DifferentiallyExpressed Genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genesand Genomes (KEGG) pathways. iPathway analysis was further used to obtainvalidated results using analysis that takes into consideration type, function,and interactions of genes in the pathway. The significant similarities anddifferences throw light into the molecular heterogeneity of TNBC, giving cluesinto the aspects that can be focused to overcome drug resistance. From thisstudy, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway appeared to be a key factorin TNBC drug resistance.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19061810 PMCID: PMC6032108PMID: 29921827
