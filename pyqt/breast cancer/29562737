Treatment of ERα positive breast cancer has long relied onendocrine therapies such as selective estrogen receptor modulators, aromataseinhibitors, and selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). The steroid-based anti-estrogen fulvestrant (5), the only approved SERD, is effective in patientswho have not previously been treated with endocrine therapy as well as inpatients who have progressed after receiving other endocrine therapies. Itsefficacy, however, may be limited due to its poor physicochemical properties. We describe the design and synthesis of a series of potent benzothiophene-containingcompounds that exhibit oral bioavailability and preclinical activity as SERDs.This article culminates in the identification of LSZ102 (10), a compound inclinical development for the treatment of ERα positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01682 PMID: 29562737
