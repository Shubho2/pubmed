As effectors of signal transduction, the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins are well suited to supportplasticity because they function as co-activators or co-repressors of mammaliantranscriptomes. Here, using both hormone-sensitive and triple-negative breastcancer (TNBC) model systems, we systematically altered EMT transcriptionalprofiles by manipulating individual BET proteins and found that BRD2 positivelyregulates EMT, whereas BRD3 and BRD4 repress this program. Knockdown ofindividual BET proteins revealed independent transcriptional networks thatdiffered from each other and from the small-molecule pan-BET inhibitor JQ1, whichpreviously had been misleadingly asserted to be BRD4-selective. Availablesmall-molecule pan-BET inhibitors, proposed as antiproliferative agents in cancerclinical trials, obscure these biological differences. Transcriptional profiling reveals that individual BET proteins, inhibited separately, engage in and controlEMT through unique processes.Visual Overview:http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanres/16/4/580/F1.large.jpg Mol CancerRes; 16(4); 580-6. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-17-0568 PMCID: PMC5882530 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29437854
