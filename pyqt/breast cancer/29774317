Rearrangements are not routinely investigated in many Turkish laboratories. This creates problems and contradictions between clinics.Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution and frequencyof rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in high-risk families and to clarifythe limits of BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing in Turkey.Materials and Methods: The study included 1809 patients at high risk of breastcancer or ovarian cancer. All patients were investigated for both small indelsand rearrangements of BRCA genes using DNA sequencing and multiplexligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis.Results: The overall frequency of rearrangements was 2% (25/1262). The frequency of rearrangements was 1.7% (18/1086) and 4% (9/206) in patients with breastcancer and ovarian cancer, respectively. The frequency of rearrangements was 3.7%(8/215) in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. The rearrangement ratewas 7.7% (2/26) in patients with both breast and ovarian cancer.Conclusions: Rearrangements were found with high rates and were stronglyassociated with bilateral and triple-negative status of patients with breastcancer, which are signs of high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Analysis ofrearrangements should definitely be included in routine clinical practice inTurkey for high-risk families and also for improved cancer risk prediction forfamilies.DOI: 10.5152/ejbh.2017.3799 PMCID: PMC5939985PMID: 29774317
