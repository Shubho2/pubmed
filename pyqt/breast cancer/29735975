In this prospective study, the efficacy oftraditional Chinese medicine acupuncture therapy in relieving CRCI and its impacton serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are evaluated. MATERIAL ANDMETHODS Eighty patients were randomly divided into a treatment group and acontrol group with 40 patients in each group. The treatment group was treated at the following acupuncture points: Baihui (DU20), Sishencong (EX-HN1), Shenting(DU24), Zusanli (ST36), Taixi (K13), Dazhong (K14), and Juegu (GB39). Cognitivefunction was assessed using the functional assessment of cancer treatmentcognition test (FACT-COG, version 3), the auditory-verbal learning test (AVLT),the verbal fluency test (VFT), the symbol digit modality test (SDMT), theclock-drawing test (CDT), and the trail-making test part B (TMT-B). In addition, blood serum levels of BDNF were measured before and after treatment. Correlationsbetween change in BDNF levels and cognitive function were also analyzed. RESULTS CRCI was ameliorated in the acupuncture treatment group, with scores on FACT-COG,AVLT-recognition and CDT assessments all significantly increased (P<0.05 in allcases). In addition, serum BDNF levels after acupuncture treatment weresignificantly higher than before treatment ([i]t[/i]=3.242, [i]P[/i]<0.01).Moreover, the level of BDNF was positively correlated with the total score ofFACT-COG, AVLT-recognition, and CDT ([i]r[/i]=0.694, 0.628, and 0.532,respectively; all P<0.05). The control group showed no statistically significant difference in any measures over the same period. CONCLUSIONS Acupuncture therapy is effective in the treatment of CRCI in breast cancer patients through amechanism that may be related to an increase of BDNF.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.909712 PMCID: PMC5963738PMID: 29735975
