In this study, the effects of methylene blue-curcumin (CU-MB) and methylene blue-salicylic acid (SA-MB) ion pair complexes onMDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells are studied. According to the thermodynamic parameters, the stability of curcumin and salicylic acid complexes ion paircomplexes was compared. The free energy of ion pair interactions was calculatedbased on binding constants. A comparison of the free energies of the complexes(CU-MB: ∆G°b1 = - 21.11 kJ/mol and ∆G°b2 = - 8.37 kJ/mol, SA-MB:∆G°b1 = - 12.92 kJ/mol and ∆G°b2 = - 9.02 kJ/mol) indicates that the interaction of methylene blue in first binding interaction with curcumin is greater than thatof methylene blue with salicylic acid. Electrostatic interactions are the mainforces in the binding of both compounds to methylene blue. All forces areinter-molecular physical interactions. The results of cellular experiments showthat ion pairing has enhanced the reduction of cell viability. By increasingmolecular stability and prevention of dimerization of methylene blue, the cellkilling potential of methylene blue increases and it subsequently causesenhancement of photodynamic efficacy.DOI: 10.1007/s10103-018-2571-0 PMID: 29959633
