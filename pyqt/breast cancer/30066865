China.Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with a high degree of diversity withregards to tumor histological stage and molecular subtypes. These heterogeneouscharacteristics determine the risk of disease progression and therapeuticresistance. Understanding tumor heterogeneity is of primary concern to identifyand develop novel and specific potential targets for diagnosis and therapy. Thepresent study analyzed 106 paired breast cancer tissues from The Cancer GenomeAtlas and demonstrated that excision repair cross‑complementation group 6 like(ERCC6L), a newly discovered DNA helicase, was overexpressed in 91.51% (97/106), unchanged in 7.54% (8/106) and decreased in 0.94% (1/106) of breast cancersamples. A short hairpin RNA ERCC6L lentivirus was constructed to investigate therole of ERCC6LR in cancer. First, a Celigo Image Cytometry system was used todetect MDA‑MB‑231 cell growth number following transfection withshERCC6L‑lentivirus or NC‑lentivirus and it was identified that the growth numberof fluorescent MDA‑MB‑231 cells post‑transduction with shERCC6L‑lentivirus wasdecreased compared with the cells transduced with NC‑lentivirus. Then, the effectof knockdown of ERCC6L expression on the cell cycle distribution and apoptosiswas to analyzed using fluorescence‑activated cell sorting (FACS). The FACS datademonstrated that knockdown of ERCC6L expression levels in MDA‑MB‑231 cellssignificantly increased S phase population but decreased the G1 and G2/M phasepopulations compared with the NC group. The apoptosis rate of MDA‑MB‑231 cellspost‑transduction with shERCC6L‑lentivirus for 5 days was increased to12.16±0.146% compared with the negative control rate (4.86±0.204%). Thesefunctional studies demonstrated that knockdown of ERCC6L expression levels inMDA‑MB‑231 cells significantly inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation,disturbed cell cycle distribution and induced apoptosis in vitro. These findings suggested that ERCC6L, which is highly expressed in breast cancer, acts as anoncogene, is involved in breast cancer development and may serve as a novelmolecular target for the treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9317 PMID: 30066865
