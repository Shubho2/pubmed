The mice were randomly divided into four groups. The mice in eachgroup (n=6) were intraperitoneally injected with 0.1 mg/kg saline (low-dose), 0.5mg/kg (middle-dose) and 1.0 mg/kg (high-dose) of acridone for 21 days,respectively. At the end of the animal experiment, the weight of tumors wasrecorded to calculate the tumor inhibition rate. The serum hormone levels inperipheral blood were determined using ELISA. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stainingwas used to analyze the histopathological changes. The expression of ABCG2protein and mRNA were determined by Western blot and RT-PCR, respectively.RESULTS: The inhibition rates of tumor growth in the high-dose, middle-dose, and low-dose groups were 29.18%, 17.21%, and 4.27%, respectively. Compared withcontrol and low-dose group, the tumors growth rate in high-dose and middle-dosegroups were decreased significantly. Histologically, the tumors were inhibited inthe growth rate, the tissue structure was broken. Estrogen in all groups withacridone treatment decreased, the progesterone in high-dose and middle-dosegroups increased remarkably. The expression of ABCG2 protein and ABCG2 mRNAdecreased after treatment with acridone.CONCLUSIONS: We showed that acridone could induce cell apoptosis, inhibited ABCG2(ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2) protein and adjusted hormone level. The results suggested that acridone could serve as a chemotherapeutic agent fortreatment of breast cancer in vivo.PMID: 29762857
