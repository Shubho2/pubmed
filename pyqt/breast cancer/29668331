Epub 2018 Apr 18.The effects of celecoxib on the proliferation and ultrastructural changes ofMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.Ma Q(1), Gao Y(1), Wei DF(1), Jiang NH(1), Ding L(1), He X(1), Wei L(2), ZhangJW(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Zhongnan Hospital, Hubei KeyLaboratory of Tumor Biological Behaviors, Hubei Cancer Clinical Study Center ,Wuhan University , Wuhan , China.(2)b Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, Hubei Provincial Key Laboratoryof Developmentally Originated Disease, School of Basic Medical Sciences , WuhanUniversity , Wuhan , China.This study sought to investigate the effects of celecoxib on the proliferationand morphological changes of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231cells. In this study, after MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with a certainconcentration of celecoxib, a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) proliferation assay wasused to detect cell viability. Western blotting was utilized to analyze theexpression level of caspase-3, which is an apoptosis-related protein. Inaddition, the morphological changes in the cells and nuclei were determined with fluorescence and electron microscope. Apoptotic nuclei and obvious cytoplasmicvacuolization were observed with a microscope. Collectively, celecoxib caninhibit the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells by increasing caspase-3 expression and causing ultrastructural changes.DOI: 10.1080/01913123.2018.1459996 PMID: 29668331
