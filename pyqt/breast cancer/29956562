Different subtypes of BC exhibit apeculiar natural history, metastatic potential and outcome. Stereotacticradiosurgery is the most used treatment for brain metastases (BM), while surgery is reserved for large and symptomatic lesions. Whole-brain radiotherapy isemployed in multiple BM not amendable to radiosurgery or surgery, and it is notemployed any more following local treatments of a limited number of BM. Acritical issue is the distinction from pseudoprogression or radionecrosis, andtumor regrowth. Considering the increase of long-term survivors after combined ornovel treatments for BM, cognitive dysfunctions following whole-brainradiotherapy represent an issue of utmost importance. Neuroprotective drugs andinnovative radiotherapy techniques are being investigated to reduce this risk of cognitive sequelae. Leptomeningeal disease represents a devastating complication,either alone or in association to BM, thus targeted therapies are employed inHER2-positive BC brain and leptomeningeal metastases.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-0630 PMID: 29956562
