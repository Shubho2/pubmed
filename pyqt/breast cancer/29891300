Toaddress this issue, many anticancer agents have been used simultaneously toachieve synergistic effects with the different mechanism of actions, however,their toxic side effects are still a big challenge. In this study, a smart,biocompatible, magnetic nanocarrier composed of multi-branched ionicliquid-chitosan grafted mPEG was designed and used for targeted multidrugdelivery of DOX and MTX as model anticancer agents to MCF7 breast cancer cells.The results of hemolysis assay on human red blood cells and cytotoxicity studies indicated that blank nanocarrier has no significant hemolytic and cytotoxiceffects in MCF7 cells as observed in the results of MTT assay, however,drugs-loaded nanocarrier could decrease the viability of MCF7 cells in adose-dependent manner. To further simulate the interaction of nanocarrier withplasma proteins, the SDS-PAGE assay was performed after the nanocarrier wasincubated with human plasma and the results indicated that a series of proteinswere attached to the surface of nanocarrier leading protein-particle coronacomplex. This complex gives a stealth property as well as increasing cellularuptake process due to the presence of proteins acting as ligands for receptors inthe surface of cancer cells that are suitable for drug delivery systems. Theefficiency of dual-drug delivery was also confirmed by cellular uptake and DAPIstaining. All these results persuade us, this nanocarrier is suitable for use in further animal studies in future investigations.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
