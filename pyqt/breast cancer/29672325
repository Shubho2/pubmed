Similar neoplasms have now been reported tooccur in various nonmammary sites including the parotid gland, submandibulargland, sinuses, lip, skin, thyroid gland, and lung. We report, to our knowledge, the first example of a primary vulvar neoplasm with pathologic features identicalto secretory carcinoma of the breast and an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion.DOI: 10.1097/PGP.0000000000000501 PMID: 29672325
