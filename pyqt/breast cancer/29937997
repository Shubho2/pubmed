Despite the availability of new drugs,the chance of survival of these patients did not increase. The combination of lowdoses of drugs in a metronomic schedule showed efficacy in clinical trials,exhibiting an anti-proliferative and anti-tumour activity. In Victor-2 study werecently evaluated a new metronomic combination (mCHT) of Capecitabine (CAPE) andVinorelbine (VNR) in breast cancer patients showing a disease control rate with amedian Progression-Free Survival (PFS) of 4.7 months in 28 TNBC patients. Here inVictor-0 study, we examined the effect of mCHT vs standard (STD) schedule ofadministration of different combinations of 5-Fluorouracil (5FU), the activemetabolite of CAPE, and VNR in TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549. Asignificant anti-proliferative activity was observed in cells treated withmetronomic vs STD administration of 5FU or VNR alone. Combination of the twodrugs showed an additive inhibitor effect on cell growth in both cell lines.Moreover, after exposure of cells to 5FU and VNR under mCHT or conventionalschedule of administration we also observed a downregulation of chemoresistancefactor Bcl-2, changes in pro-apoptotic protein Bax and in cleaved effectorcaspase-3 and increased expression of LC3A/B autophagy protein. Our resultstherefore suggest that molecular mechanisms implicated in apoptosis and autophagyas well as the cross-talk between these two forms of cell death in MDA-MB-231 andBT-549 cells treated with 5FU and VNR is dose- and schedule-dependent and providesome insights about the roles of autophagy and senescence in 5FU/VNR-induced celldeath.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25422 PMCID: PMC6007943PMID: 29937997
