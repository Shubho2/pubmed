However, merely preserving the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) does not guarantee a good outcome. Darkly pigmented NACs and a tendency for poor scarring outcomes areparticular challenges when treating Asian patients. Herein, we review thereconstructive outcomes following NSM at Singapore General Hospital.METHODS: All breasts reconstructed following NSM over an 11-year period from 2005to 2015 were reviewed. Information was collected from the patients' records onmastectomy indications, operative details, and complications. Patientsatisfaction, breast sensation, and aesthetic outcomes were evaluated in 15patients. Sensation was quantified using the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test.RESULTS: A total of 142 NSMs were performed in 133 patients for breast cancer(n=122, 85.9%) or risk reduction (n=20, 14.1%). Of the procedures, 114 (80.2%)were autologous reconstructions, while 27 (19.0%) were reconstructions withimplants. Complications occurred in 28 breasts (19.7%), with the most commoncomplication being NAC necrosis, which occurred in 17 breasts (12.0%). Fourbreasts (2.8%) had total NAC necrosis. The overall mean patient satisfactionscore was 3.0 (good). The sensation scores were significantly diminished in theskin envelope, areola, and nipple of breasts that had undergone NSM compared tonon-operated breasts (P<0.05). Half of the subset of 15 patients in whomaesthetic outcomes were evaluated had reduced nipple projection.CONCLUSIONS: Immediate reconstruction after NSM was performed with a lowcomplication rate in this series, predominantly through autologousreconstruction. Patients should be informed of potential drawbacks, including NACnecrosis, reduced nipple projection, and diminished sensation.DOI: 10.5999/aps.2017.01067 PMCID: PMC5968316PMID: 29788682
