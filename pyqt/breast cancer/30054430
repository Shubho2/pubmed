Inrecent years regulation of genes involved in heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesishave received increased interest as regulators of breast cancer cell adhesion andinvasion. The exostosin (EXT) proteins are glycosyltransferases involved inelongation of HS, a regulator of intracellular signaling, cell-cell interactions and tissue morphogenesis. The EXT family contains five members: EXT1, EXT2 andthree exostosin-like (EXTL) members: EXTL1, EXTL2 and EXTL3. While the expressionlevels of these enzymes change in tumor cells, little is known how this changesthe structure and function of HS. In this study, we investigated gene expression profiles of the EXT-family members, their glycosyltransferase activities and HSstructure in the estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive MCF7 cells,and the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growthfactor receptor-2 negative MDA-MB-231 and HCC38 epithelial breast carcinoma cell lines. The gene expression profiles for MDA-MB-231 and HCC38 cells were verysimilar. In both cell lines EXTL2 was found to be up-regulated whereas EXT2 wasdown-regulated. Interestingly, despite having similar expression of HS elongationenzymes the two cell lines synthesized HS chains of significantly differentlength. Furthermore, both MDA-MB-231 and HCC38 exhibited markedly decreasedlevels of HS 6-O-sulfated disaccharides. Although the gene expression profiles ofthe elongation enzymes did not correlate with the length of HS chains our resultsindicated specific differences in EXT enzyme levels and HS fine structurecharacteristic of the carcinogenic properties of the breast carcinoma cells.©2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20180770 PMID: 30054430
