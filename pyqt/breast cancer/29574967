Epub 2018 Apr6.Is the incidence of advanced-stage breast cancer affected by whether women attenda steady-state screening program?de Munck L(1)(2), Fracheboud J(3), de Bock GH(2), den Heeten GJ(4)(5), SieslingS(1)(6), Broeders MJM(4)(7).Author information: (1)Department of Research, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation,Utrecht, The Netherlands.(2)Department of Epidemiology, University of Groningen, University Medical CenterGroningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.(3)Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.(4)Dutch Reference Centre for Screening, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.(5)Department of Radiology, Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam, Amsterdam, TheNetherlands.(6)Department of Health Technology & Services Research, MIRA Institute forBiomedical Technology and Technical Medicine, University of Twente, Enschede, TheNetherlands.(7)Radboud Institute for Health Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center,Nijmegen, The Netherlands.In this cross-sectional population-based study, we assessed the incidence ofadvanced breast cancer based on screening attendance. Women from the Netherlands Cancer Registry were included if aged ≥49 years and diagnosed with breast cancer between 2006 and 2011, and data were linked with the screening program. Cancerswere defined as screen-related (diagnosed <24 months after screening) ornonscreened (all other breast cancers). Two cut-offs were used to define advancedbreast cancer: TNM-stage (III-IV vs 0-I-II) and T-stage alone (≥15 mm vs <15 mmor DCIS). The incidence rates were adjusted for age and logistic regression wasused to compare groups. Of the 72,612 included women diagnosed with breastcancer, 44,246 (61%) had screen-related breast cancer. By TNM stage, advancedcancer was almost three times as likely to be at an advanced TNM stage in thenonscreened group compared with the screen-related group (38 and 94 per 100,000, respectively; OR: 2.86, 95%CI: 2.72-3.00). By T-stage, the incidence of advanced cancer was higher overall, and in nonscreened women was significantly higher thanin screened women (210 and 169 per 100,000; OR: 1.85, 95%CI: 1.78-1.93). Data on actual screening attendance showed that the incidence of advanced breast cancerwas significantly higher in nonscreened women than in screened women, supporting the expectation that screening would cause a stage shift to early detection.Despite critical evaluations of breast cancer screening programs, our data showthat breast cancer screening is a valuable tool that can reduce the diseaseburden in women.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31388 PMID: 29574967
