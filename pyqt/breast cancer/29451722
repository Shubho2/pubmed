R. China.In photodynamic therapy (PDT), the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS)produced in the cell directly determines the therapeutic effect. Improvement inROS concentration can be realized by reducing the glutathione (GSH) level orincreasing the amount of photosensitizer. However, excessive amountsphotosensitizer may cause side effects. Therefore, the development ofphotosensitizers that reduce GSH levels through synergistically improving ROSconcentration in order to strengthen the efficacy of PDT for tumor is important. We report a nano-metal-organic framework (CuII -metalated nano-MOF {CuL-[AlOH]2}n (MOF-2, H6 L=mesotetrakis(4-carboxylphenyl)porphyrin)) based on CuII as theactive center for PDT. This MOF-2 is readily taken up by breast cancer cells, andhigh levels of ROS are generated under light irradiation. Meanwhile,intracellular GSH is considerably decreased owing to absorption on MOF-2; thissynergistically increases ROS concentration and accelerates apoptosis, therebyenhancing the effect of PDT. Notably, based on the direct adsorption of GSH,MOF-2 showed a comparable effect with the commercial antitumor drug camptothecin in a mouse breast cancer model. This work provides strong evidence for MOF-2 as apromising new PDT candidate and anticancer drug.Â© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.DOI: 10.1002/anie.201710800 PMID: 29451722
