Italy.Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, which incidence has increasedin recent years. It is constituted by very heterogeneous tissue characterized by an abnormal microenvironment regulating tumor progression and providing evasionfrom cancer therapies. Breast cancer associated fibroblasts (BCAFs) are the main cell type of breast cancer microenvironment and can represent up to 80 % of thetumor mass. In particular, BCAFs induce cancer initiation, proliferation,invasion and metastasis by undergoing an irreversible activation processassociated with secretion of growth factors, cytokines, and paracrineinteractions. Therapy resistance is the main cause of poor therapeutic results oreven failure in breast cancer patients. Despite recent advances in breast cancer management, there is a need for new prognostic markers and novel agents fortargeting key signalling pathways to either improve the efficacy of the currenttherapies, or reduce toxicity. In this view, BCAFs represent markers useful toclinical diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of breast cancer. This review focuses on the role of BCAFs in cancer, and describes the processes ofendocrine/chemotherapy resistance linked to BCAFs action. Moreover, it points to molecules and pathways regulating therapy resistance induced by BCAFs. Finally,potential therapeutic strategies targeting BCAFs and offering new tools in breastcancer therapy are highlighted.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/0929867325666180309120746 PMID: 29521203
