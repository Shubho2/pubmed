Camargo Cancer Center, São Paulo, SP,Brazil.A total of 115 patients who used everolimus were evaluated. The mean age was 57(±13.3) years old, and 87 patients were women (75.6%). mTOR inhibitor-associated stomatitis (mIAS) was observed in 36 patients (31.3%). The lesions ranged from0.5 cm to 1.5 cm, and the tongue was the main site affected. In addition, 21patients (58.3%) required a dose reduction of everolimus due to mIAS. Patientswho had breast cancer presented 2.29-fold higher risk for developing mIAS whencompared to patients with kidney or neuroendocrine tumors. This study emphasizes the high prevalence of mIAS in patients using everolimus, in particular, inpatients with breast cancer.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.
