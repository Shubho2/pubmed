Simian virus 40 (SV40 = Macaca mulatta polyomavirus 1) sequenceshave been detected in different human cancers, including osteosarcoma. SV40 is anoncogenic virus in vivo, whereas it transforms different kinds of mammaliancells, as well as distinct human cell types. SV40 injected in rodents inducestumors of different histotypes, such as bone and brain tumors. Herein, theassociation between OS and SV40 large T antigen (Tag) was studied by employingindirect ELISAs using synthetic peptides that mimic different epitopes of theSV40 Tag, the viral oncoprotein. Indirect ELISAs were used to detect serum IgGantibodies against this oncogenic virus in samples from OS patients. Controlswere sera from healthy subjects (HS) and oncological patients affect by breastcancer (BC), which is not associated with SV40. It turned out that sera of OSpatients had a higher prevalence of SV40 Tag antibodies, 35%, compared to HS, 20%and BC, 19%, respectively. The different prevalence of SV40 Tag antibodiesrevealed in OS vs. HS and vs. BC is statistically significant with P < 0.05 and P< 0.01, respectively. Our immunological data indicate a significantly higherprevalence of antibodies against SV40 Tag epitopes in serum samples from OSpatients compared to HS and BC, the controls. These results suggest anassociation between OS and SV40 Tag, indicating that this oncogenic virus may be a cofactor in OS development.DOI: 10.3389/fcell.2018.00064 PMCID: PMC6036318PMID: 30013971
