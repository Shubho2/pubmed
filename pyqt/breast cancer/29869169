[Epub ahead of print]Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel flavone/triazole/benzimidazolehybrids and flavone/isoxazole-annulated heterocycles as antiproliferative andantimycobacterial agents.Rao YJ(1), Sowjanya T(2), Thirupathi G(3), Murthy NYS(4), Kotapalli SS(5).Author information: (1)Department of Chemistry, University College of Science, Saifabad, OsmaniaUniversity, Hyderabad, India. yjpr_19@yahoo.com.(2)Department of Chemistry, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad,India.(3)Department of Chemistry, University College of Science, Saifabad, OsmaniaUniversity, Hyderabad, India.(4)Department of Chemistry, Palamuru University, Mahabubnagar, India.(5)Centre for Chemical Biology, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology,Hyderabad, India.A series of new flavone/isoxazole fused heterocycles 5a-f andflavone/1,2,3-triazole/benzimidazole hybrid heterocycles compounds 7a-t weresynthesized via an intramolecular cyclization and Cu(I)-catalyzed click1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The products were evaluated for theirantiproliferative activity against human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) usingsulforhodamine B assay (SRB) and antimycobacterial activity using turbidometricassay. The majority of the tested compounds exhibited antiproliferative activity and antimycobacterial activity. Compounds 7l, 7q and 7r showed moderateantiproliferative activity with IC50 values 17.9, 14.2, 19.1 [Formula: see text],respectively, and compound 5a showed moderate antimycobacterial activity with41.7% of inhibition at 30 [Formula: see text] concentration.DOI: 10.1007/s11030-018-9833-4 PMID: 29869169
