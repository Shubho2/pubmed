[Epub ahead of print]Transcriptional repression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 by ClC-3Cl- /H+ transporter inhibition in human breast cancer cells.Fujimoto M(1), Kito H(2), Kajikuri J(2), Ohya S(1)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacology, Division of Pathological Sciences, KyotoPharmaceutical University, Kyoto, Japan.(2)Department of Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya CityUniversity, Nagoya, Japan.Recent studies have indicated that the intracellular concentration of chlorideions (Cl- ) regulates gene expression in several types of cells and that Cl-modulators positively or negatively regulate the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target ofrapamycin (mTOR) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3signaling pathways. We previously reported that the Ca2+ -activated Cl- channelanoctamine (ANO)1 regulated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)transcription in breast cancer YMB-1 cells. However, the mechanisms underlyingANO1-regulated HER2 gene expression have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed the involvement of intracellular organelle ClC-3 Cl- /H+transporter in HER2 transcription in breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells. ThesiRNA-mediated inhibition of ClC-3, but not ANO1, markedly repressed HER2transcription in MDA-MB-453 cells. Subsequently, treatments with the AKTinhibitor AZD 5363 and mTOR inhibitor everolimus significantly enhanced HER2transcription in MDA-MB-453 cells, whereas that with the STAT3 inhibitor5,15-diphenylporphyrin (5,15-DPP) inhibited it. AKT and mTOR inhibitors alsosignificantly enhanced HER2 transcription in YMB-1 cells. The siRNA-mediatedinhibition of ClC-3 and ANO1 resulted in increased AKT phosphorylation anddecreased STAT3 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-453 and YMB-1 cells, respectively. The intracellular Cl- channel protein CLIC1 was expressed in both cells; however, itssiRNA-mediated inhibition did not elicit the transcriptional repression of HER2. Collectively, our results demonstrate that intracellular Cl- regulation byANO1/ClC-3 participates in HER2 transcription, mediating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and/orSTAT3 signaling pathway(s) in HER2-positive breast cancer cells, and support the potential of ANO1/ClC-3 blockers as therapeutic options for patients withresistance to anti-HER2 therapies.Â© 2018 The Authors.
