Compounds 1e and 1r were the most potentamong all the other tested analogues (IC50 = 60 nM and 30 nM, respectively). Theywere 1.6 and 3.2 times, respectively, more potent than our lead compound,KIST101029 (IC50 = 96 nM). Compound 1r was tested over a panel of 40 kinasesincluding FMS, and exerted selectivity against FMS kinase. It was further tested against bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and its IC50 was 84 nM (2.32-fold more potent than KIST101029 (IC50 = 195 nM)). Compound 1r was also tested forantiproliferative activity against a panel of six ovarian, two prostate, and fivebreast cancer cell lines, and its IC50 values ranged from 0.15-1.78 µM. Itpossesses also the merit of selectivity towards cancer cells than normalfibroblasts.DOI: 10.1080/14756366.2018.1491563 PMID: 30070930
