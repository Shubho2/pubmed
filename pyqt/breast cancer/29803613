Employing tumormicroenvironment in programming intelligent nanosystems has attractedconsiderable attention for combinative antitumor therapy. Herein, we proposed acore-shell based drug depot consisting of micellar core and crosslinked-gel shellfor site-specific shuttling of paclitaxel (PTX) and KIAA1199 specific shRNA(shKIAA). Poly (e-caprolactone) were grafted with branched polyethylenimine(PEI-PCL) as micellar core, into which hydrophobic PTX was embedded; whileshKIAA, a reliable RNAi regimen for metastatic cell inhibition was condensed withPEI through electrostatic interaction; and then photo-crosslinked hyaluronic acid(m-HA) was further coated as shell. The nanoscale drug depot sharedHAase-triggered charge switching and desirable release profile. Upon reachingtumor region, HA shell was degraded by concentrated HAase, and facilitated drugshuttling to individual subcellular targeting site. Rapid intracellulartrafficking of micellar core achieved endo/lysosomal escape and cytoplasmicliberation. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of "nanodepot"toward human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was 0.016 μg/mL (PTXconcentration), approximately 3-fold decrease compared to that of monotherapygroup (0.043 μg/mL). The tumor weight inhibition (TWI) is 83.30% in xenograftedMDA-MB-231 tumor model and metastasis was effectively inhibited in 4T1 orthotopictumors. Moreover, knockdown of KIAA1199 via sustainable RNAi affected a broadrange of cellular functions including apoptosis, migration and invasion.Collectively, tumor environment differentiated spatiotemporal co-delivery fashionholds a great promise for combinative treatment with enhanced efficacy onmetastatic cancer cases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
