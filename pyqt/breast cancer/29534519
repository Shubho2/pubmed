Around 1 in 10 of all cancers diagnosed in men, lungcancer contributed to a total fraction of 20% cancer deaths. Naringenin (NAR) is well known for its chemopreventive properties since ancient times but lacks anappropriate delivery carrier. The objective of present study was to expand thefunctionality of naringenin loaded poly caprolactone (PCL) nanoparticles in termsof release, chemoprevention and therapeutics. Polymeric nanoparticles such as PCLlack target specificity; hence, surface modification was attempted using layer bylayer technique (LBL) to achieve improved and desired delivery as well as target specificity. The designing of Hyaluronic acid (HA) decorated PCL nanoparticleswere prepared by utilizing self-assembling LBL technique, where a polycationiclayer of a polymer was used as a linker for modification between two polyanionic layers. Additionally, an attempt has been made to strengthen the therapeuticefficacy of PCL nanocarriers by active targeting and overcoming the extracellularmatrix associated barriers of tumors using HA targeting cluster determinant 44receptor (CD44). Cell cytotoxicity study on A549 cells and J774 macrophage cells depicted enhanced anticancer effect of NAR-HA@CH-PCL-NP with safe profile onmacrophages. Uptake study on A549 cells advocated enhanced drug uptake by cancer cells. Cell cycle arrest analysis (A549 cell lines) demonstrated the superiorcytotoxic effect and active targeting of NAR-HA@CH-PCL-NP. Furtherchemopreventive treatment with NAR-HA@CH-PCL-NP was found effective in tumorgrowth inhibitory effect against urethane-induced lung cancer in rat. Inconclusion, developed formulation possesses a promising potential as atherapeutic and chemopreventive agent against urethane-induced lung carcinoma in albino wistar rats.DOI: 10.3390/pharmaceutics10010033 PMCID: PMC5874846PMID: 29534519
