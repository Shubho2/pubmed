Here we overcome this challenge using a nano-surfactant, asterilized 18-amino-acid biomimetic of the amphipathic helical motif abundant in HDL-apolipoproteins. As it induces a nanoscale phase (glass) transition in thephospholipid monolayer, the peptide stabilizes 5-7 nm phospholipid micelles that do not fuse at high concentrations but aggregate into stable micellesomesexhibiting size-dependent penetration into tumors. In mice bearing humanHer-2-positive breast cancer xenografts, high-payload paclitaxel encapsulated in 25 nm (diameter) micellesomes kills more cancer cells than paclitaxel in standardclinical formulation, as evidenced by the enhanced apparent diffusion coefficientof water determined by in vivo MR imaging. Importantly, the bio-inertness of thisbiomimetic nano-surfactant spares the nanoparticles from being absorbed by liver hepatocytes, making them more generally available for drug delivery.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
