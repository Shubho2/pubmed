Previous studies have linkedimmune infiltration with tumor neoantigen levels, but the broad applicability of this concept remains unknown. Here, we find that while this observation is trueacross cancers characterized by recurrent mutations, it does not hold for cancersdriven by recurrent copy number alterations, such as breast and pancreatictumors. To understand immune invasion in these cancers, we developed anintegrative multi-omics framework, identifying the DNA damage response proteinATM as a driver of cytokine production leading to increased immune infiltration. This prediction was validated in numerous orthogonal datasets, as well asexperimentally in vitro and in vivo by cytokine release and immune cellmigration. These findings demonstrate diverse drivers of immune cell infiltrationacross cancer lineages and may facilitate the clinical adaption ofimmunotherapies across diverse malignancies.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03730-x PMCID: PMC5882811PMID: 29615613
