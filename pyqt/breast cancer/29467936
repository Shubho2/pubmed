Anti-HER2 therapy may provide a strategy for eliminating CSC and EMT, whichcontribute to therapeutic resistance. No study has determined the changes in the quantity or characteristics of CSCs or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with EMTphenotype during preoperative anti-HER2 therapy, and whether these changescorrelate to response to dual anti-HER2 therapy. In a prospective clinical trial to evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarkers, 18 patients with operable primaryHER2-positive breast cancer received dual anti-Her2 preoperative therapy withtrastuzumab and lapatinib with paclitaxel. Proportions of tumor cells with CSCcharacteristics and EMT markers in CTC's were estimated at baseline, after 6 and 18 weeks of preoperative therapy to determine the quantitative cutoff value topredict pathologic complete response (pCR). Out of 18 patients, 8 (44%) had apCR; 5 of these 8 patients (62%) were positive for CD44v at baseline and nonewere positive on the 6-week biopsy. In contrast, 6 of the 10 patients without pCRexhibited persistent levels, or enrichment of CD44v proportion and expression at 6 and 18 weeks (p=0.0128). Other biomarkers were not statistically significantpredictors of pCR. Enrichment of CD44v-positive tumor cells after dual anti-HER2 therapy alone may predict poor response to dual anti-HER2 therapy pluschemotherapy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23914 PMCID: PMC5805522PMID: 29467936
