As an example,effective DNA repair is brought about by the concerted action of several DNAprocessing proteins. Both changes in the structure of individual proteins and in the arrangement of multiple proteins together (referred to here as architecture) are inherent to biological function. These dynamic changes are exemplified in thebreast cancer susceptibility protein 2 (BRCA2). BRCA2 is a DNA repair proteinthat undergoes changes in its own structure and affects changes in moleculararchitecture with partners during homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNAdouble strand breaks. These challenging features of BRCA2 protein, its size andpredicted stretches of intrinsically disordered regions, have made it difficultto determine the structural consequences and mechanistic importance ofinteractions between full-length BRCA2 with RAD51 and other HR proteins. In this chapter, we describe scanning force microscopy (SFM)-based approaches to studyDNA-protein complexes involved in HR, the architectural plasticity of full-lengthBRCA2, and the dynamic reorganization of these molecular components associatedwith essential steps of HR.© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
