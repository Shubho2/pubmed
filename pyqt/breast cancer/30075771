This study evaluated the patient radiation dose and estimated the radiation cancer risk on dental CBCTaccording to the calculations by the Monte Carlo simulation method.METHODS: The dental CBCT scanner evaluated in this project was the i- CAT®(Imaging Sciences International Inc., PA, U.S.A.) device. Organ doses andeffective doses were calculated by using personal computer-based Monte Carlosimulation (PCXMC 2.0 Rotation) software. The cancer risk resulting from theexposure to ionizing radiation was estimated by using the BEIR VII (BiologicEffects of Ionizing Radiation VII) report model, and the risk of exposure-induceddeath (REID) was assessed by PCXMC 2.0 Rotation software.RESULTS: The largest contribution to the organ dose and effective dose at Zref83 cm positioned in the dental CBCT x-ray beam centerline was from the salivaryglands (738.29μGy, 7.38 μSv). The different organ doses showed the maximum valuesat the different Zref locations, and the largest contribution to the organ doseand effective dose of all simulated positions was from the thyroid (928.77μGy,37.5 μSv). The REID values in the 10-year olds (22.6 × 10- 7, female; 19 × 10- 7,male) were approximately double than those in 30-year olds (10.4 × 10- 7, female;8.88 × 10- 7, male) for all cancers. The highest change during age range from 10 to 30 was shown in breast cancer of females.CONCLUSIONS: Although individual cancer risk estimates as a function of genderand age are small, the concern about the risks from dental CBCT is related to therapid increase in its use for orthodontic practice, especially in childrenpatients.DOI: 10.1186/s12903-018-0592-5 PMID: 30075771
