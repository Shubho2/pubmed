[Epub ahead of print]Monoclonal antibody therapy in cancer: When two is better (and considerably more expensive) than one.Peterson GM(1), Thomas J(2), Yee KC(2), Kosari S(2), Naunton M(2), Olesen IH(3).Author information: (1)School of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS, Australia.(2)Faculty of Health, University of Canberra, Bruce, ACT, Australia.(3)The Andrew Love Cancer Centre, Barwon Health, Geelong, VIC, Australia.WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: It is 20 years since the US Food and DrugAdministration approved the first successful monoclonal anticancer antibody,trastuzumab. The therapeutic utility of monoclonal antibodies in cancer is often limited by partial clinical responses and the development of tumour resistance.An expanding strategy, to be reviewed here, to overcome the limited response and resistance to monotherapy utilizes concurrent treatment with two synergisticmonoclonal antibodies.COMMENT: Key examples include two monoclonal antibodies, each engaging a distinctsite of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), in the treatment ofbreast cancer and a combination of antibodies to two distinct T-cell antigens forthe treatment of melanoma. Here, we provide an overview of the rationale andevidence for using selected monoclonal antibodies in combination for treatingsome cancers, along with potential hazards, especially autoimmune-relatedtoxicities.WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Thorough research, the development of panels ofbiomarkers and individualization of therapy will be necessary to optimize the useof these combinations and minimize the substantial risk of overstimulating theimmune system.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/jcpt.12750 PMID: 30047144
