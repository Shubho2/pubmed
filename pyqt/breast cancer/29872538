While aberrant expression of PEAK1 has been linked to cancerprogression, its normal physiological role in vertebrate biology is not known.Here we provide evidence that PEAK1 plays a central role in orchestrating newvessel formation in vertebrates. Deletion of the PEAK1 gene in zebrafish, mice,and human endothelial cells (ECs) induced severe defects in new blood vesselformation due to deficiencies in EC proliferation, survival, and migration. Gene transcriptional and proteomic analyses of PEAK1-deficient ECs revealed asignificant loss of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) mRNAand protein expression, as well as downstream signaling to its effectors, ERK,Akt, and Src kinase. PEAK1 regulates VEGFR2 expression by binding to andincreasing the protein stability of the transcription factor GATA-binding protein2 (GATA2), which controls VEGFR2 transcription. Importantly,PEAK1-GATA2-dependent VEGFR2 expression is mediated by EC adhesion to the ECM andis required for breast cancer-induced new vessel formation in mice. Also,elevated expression of PEAK1 and VEGFR2 mRNA are highly correlated in many human cancers including breast cancer. Together, our findings reveal a novelPEAK1-GATA2-VEGFR2 signaling axis that integrates cell adhesion and growth factorcues from the extracellular environment necessary for new vessel formation duringvertebrate development and cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41421-018-0024-3 PMCID: PMC5972149PMID: 29872538
