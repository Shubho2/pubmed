Electronic address: zhangbei124@aliyun.com.Recently, the link between inflammation and cancer has been targeted for theprevention or treatment of malignant tumours. We aimed to investigate therelationship between Th17 cells and CXCL1 in breast cancer and the biologicaleffects of CXCL1 on breast cancer. In vivo, the Th17 cell frequency in theperipheral blood was determined by flow cytometry. Secretion of IL-17 and CXCL1in the blood serum was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Expression of IL-17A and CXCL1 mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR. In vitro, theeffects of Th17/CXCL1 during breast cancer were assessed in the human breastcancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Cell proliferation was measured using theCCK8 assay. Cell invasion and migration ability were assessed using a transwellcell invasion and wound- healing assay. In vivo, Th17 cells and CXCL1 wereincreased in breast cancer patients. Moreover, their changes were correlated inbreast cancer cells. Th17 cells upregulate the production of CXCL1 during breast cancer progression. CXCL1, which is produced by breast cancer cells, can promote cancer growth and development, and may also point to a specific histogeneticpathway.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
