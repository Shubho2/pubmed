Participants were allocated to 2 groups.Group 1 received vitamin D (Cholecalciferol) 50,000 IU in tablet form, monthly,for 1 yr. Group 2 received vitamin E 400 IU in tablet form, monthly, for the sameperiod of time. Participants had follow-up clinic visits every 6 mo and received an annual mammogram.RESULTS: Final data were evaluated based on 216 and 194 women in the vitamin Dand control groups. The mean decrease in mammographic density was -5.01%(95% CI, -9.9% to -0.01%) and -2.34 %(95% CI, -6.84% to -2.15%) in the vitamin D andcontrol groups, respectively. There was no significant association betweenvitamin D consumption and breast density after 1 yr (OR = 0.7, 95% CI, 0.46 to1.06; P = 0.1).Similar results were observed when multivariate model of logistic regression analysis was performed.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that monthly consumption of 50,000 IU of vitamin Dsupplementation for 1 yr did not affect breast density.DOI: 10.1080/01635581.2018.1446088 PMID: 29528704
