Recently, aberrantly expressed LINC01296 was observed in severalmalignancies. To the best of our knowledge, its clinical significance and exacteffects on BC is still unclear. In this work, the clinical value of LINC01296 wasevaluated in patients with BC. Additionally, cell proliferation, apoptosis,migration and invasion capacities were detected after silencing of LINC01296.Furthermore, the xenograft experiment was used to confirm the in vitro results.As a result, LINC01296 is up-regulated in both BC tissue samples and cells.Up-regulated LINC01296 is correlated with larger tumor size, positive lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage of patients with BC. Additionally, Coxregression analysis confirmed LINC01296 as an independent prognostic indicatorfor patients with BC. For the part of functional assays, silencing of LINC01296inhibited BC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Also, cell apoptosis was enhanced after LINC01296 silenced. Moreover, cell migration and invasion potential wereboth abrogated in the si-LINC01296 groups. Collectively, LINC01296 may functionas a potential prognostic predictor and therapeutic target for patients with BC.Copyright Â© 2018.
