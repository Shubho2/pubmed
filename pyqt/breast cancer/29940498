Thelack of volume information has been one criticism, as the use of 3D informationmight improve accuracy in aesthetic evaluation. In this study, we have evaluated the added value of 3D information to two methods of aesthetic evaluation: a panelof experts; and an augmented version of the computational model - BCCT.core3d.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Within the scope of EU Seventh Framework Programme Project PICTURE, 2D and 3D images from 106 patients from three clinical centres wereevaluated by a panel of 17 experts and the BCCT.core. Agreement between allmethods was calculated using the kappa (K) and weighted kappa (wK) statistics.RESULTS: Subjective agreement between 2D and 3D individual evaluation was fair tomoderate. The agreement between the expert classification and the BCCT.coresoftware with both 2D and 3D features was also fair to moderate.CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of 3D images did not add significant information tothe aesthetic evaluation either by the panel or the software. Evaluation ofaesthetic outcome can be performed using of the BCCT.core software, with a singlefrontal image.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
