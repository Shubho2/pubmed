In fact, it is placedin the third place among the most diagnosed cancer in men, after lung andprostate cancer, and in the second one for the most diagnosed cancer in women,following breast cancer. Moreover, its high mortality rates classifies it amongthe leading causes of cancer‑related death worldwide. Thus, in order to helpclinicians to optimize their practice, it is crucial to introduce more effective tools that will improve not only early diagnosis, but also prediction of the mostlikely progression of the disease and response to chemotherapy. In that way, theywill be able to decrease both morbidity and mortality of their patients. Inaccordance with that, colon cancer research has described numerous biomarkers fordiagnostic, prognostic and predictive purposes that either alone or as part of a panel would help improve patient's clinical management. This review aims todescribe the most accepted biomarkers among those proposed for use in CRC dividedbased on the clinical specimen that is examined (tissue, faeces or blood) alongwith their restrictions. Lastly, new insight in CRC monitoring will be discussed presenting promising emerging biomarkers (telomerase activity, telomere lengthand micronuclei frequency).DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6330 PMCID: PMC5983921PMID: 29565457
