Epub2018 Feb 14.The Perils of Single-Site Genetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer Syndromes in the Era of Next-Generation Sequencing.Casasanta N(1), Stark E(2), McHenry A(2), Biagi T(2), Kaltman R(2).Author information: (1)School of Medicine and Health Sciences, The George Washington University,Washington, DC, USA ncasasanta@gwmail.gwu.edu.(2)Medical Faculty Associates, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.A challenge in counseling patients with a family history suggesting a hereditary cancer syndrome is deciding which genetic tests or panels to order. In thisarticle, we discuss the identification of multiple familial mutations throughgenetic counseling and panel testing. For patients meeting National ComprehensiveCancer Network criteria for clinical genetic testing, providers should considerexpanded panels to provide a more complete assessment of one's genetic risk. The continued use of expanded panel testing in the clinical setting will help inform optimal management of cancer patients, as well as the management of theirunaffected family members. The mutation discovered in this case was in the ATMgene. The clinical significance of the mutation, potential therapeutic targets,and proper clinical management are discussed.KEY POINTS: With single-site genetictesting, there is the potential to miss hereditary genetic syndromes that can be managed clinically.Between 4% and 6% of hereditary breast and ovarian cancersyndromes are caused by genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2.ATM is a DNA mismatchrepair gene associated with double-stranded DNA break repair and cell cyclecheckpoint arrest.The risk of developing female breast cancer by age 50 and byage 80 in ATM heterozygotes is 9% and 17%-52%, respectively.Â© AlphaMed Press 2018.DOI: 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0372 PMCID: PMC5896713 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29445031
