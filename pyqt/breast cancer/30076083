A region of interest wasselected for each lesion on FFDM, synthesized 2D, and DBT key slice images.Features were extracted from each lesion using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) and served as input to a support vector machine classifier trained in the task of predicting likelihood of malignancy.RESULTS: From receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of all 78 lesions,the synthesized 2D image performed best in both the cradiocaudal view (area underthe ROC curve [AUC] = 0.81, SE = 0.05) and mediolateral oblique view (AUC = 0.88,SE = 0.04) in the task of lesion characterization. When cradiocaudal andmediolateral oblique data of each lesion were merged through soft voting, DBT keyslice image performed best (AUC = 0.89, SE = 0.04). When only masses andarchitectural distortions (ARDs) were considered, DBT performed significantlybetter than FFDM (p = 0.024).CONCLUSION: DBT performed significantly better than FFDM in the merged viewclassification of mass and ARD lesions. The increased performance suggests thatthe information extracted by the CNN from DBT images may be more relevant tolesion malignancy status than the information extracted from FFDM images.Therefore, this study provides supporting evidence for the efficacy ofcomputer-aided diagnosis on DBT in the evaluation of mass and ARD lesions.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.
