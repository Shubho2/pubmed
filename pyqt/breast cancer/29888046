Our retrospective, age-matched, case-control study evaluated the differential value of mammography and genetic variants to predict breastcancer depending on patient age. We developed predictive models using logisticregression with group lasso comparing (1) diagnostic mammography findings, (2)selected genetic variants, and (3) a combination of both. For women older than60, mammography features were most predictive of breast cancer risk (imaging AUC = 0.74, genetic variants AUC = 0.54, combined AUC = 0.71). For women younger than60 there is additional benefit to obtaining genetic testing (imaging AUC = 0.69, genetic variants AUC = 0.70, combined AUC = 0.72). In summary, genetic testingsupplements mammography in younger women while mammography appears sufficient in older women for breast cancer risk prediction.PMCID: PMC5961791PMID: 29888046
