Although the application of modern techniques has led to a significantly reduction in radiation-induced heart disease, it is still recognized as theleading causes of morbidity and mortality among breast cancer survivors. With thegrowing number of long-term survivors, it is important to understand thecardiovascular risks associated with radiotherapy. Questions exist regarding the existence or not of a safe radiation threshold dose that the heart (or itssubstructures) can receive and strategies to minimize risk of radiation. Thispaper aims to review the current understanding of radiation-inducedcardiotoxicity and try to give answers to those unsettled issues based on currentliteratures.Copyright Â© 2018.
