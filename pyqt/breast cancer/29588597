The present study was designed to investigate thepredictive value of different peripheral inflammation/immune biomarker responses to NAC and prognosis in breast cancer patients.Materials and methods: A total of 180 breast cancer patients treated with NAC in the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University between January2008 and March 2015 were enrolled in the study. The associations betweeninflammation/immune indicators and pathological complete response (pCR) weredetermined, and the prognostic value of inflammation/immune indicators was alsoevaluated.Results: In the univariate analysis, patients with a high pretreatment peripherallymphocyte count (.2.06×109/L) showed a higher pCR rate than those with a lowlymphocyte count (23.9% vs 10.4%, P=0.023). The pCR rate of patients with aneutrophil: lymphocyte ratio ≤2.15 was significantly higher than that of patientswith a high neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio (20% vs 7.8%; P=0.03). However,multivariate analysis revealed that only the high lymphocyte count was predictivefor pCR (odds ratio: 4.375, 95% CI: 1.429-13.392, P=0.010). In the survivalanalysis, patients with a higher neutrophil count (.2.65×109/L) were confirmed tohave a shorter disease-free survival (hazard ratio: 4.322, 95% CI: 1.028-18.174, P=0.046), and the high neutrophil count was significantly associated withlymphovascular invasion (P=0.037).Conclusion: We demonstrated that a high level of baseline peripheral lymphocytecount can be a predictor for high efficacy of NAC for breast cancer patients, andlow baseline peripheral neutrophil count may contribute to the favorabledisease-free survival.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S148496 PMCID: PMC5858818PMID: 29588597
