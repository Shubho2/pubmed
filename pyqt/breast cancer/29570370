The objective of this study is to evaluate screeningmammography utilization trends among the Medicare population from 2005 to 2015and examine the volume of DBT studies performed in 2015, the first year for whichprocedural billing codes for DBT are available.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed national Medicare Part B Physician/SupplierProcedure Summary master files from 2005 to 2015, to determine the annualutilization rate of screening mammography on the basis of procedure codes usedfor film-screen and digital screening mammography. We also used thePhysician/Supplier Procedure Summary master files to determine the volume ofscreening and diagnostic DBT studies performed in 2015.RESULTS: The utilization rate of screening mammography per 1000 women in theMedicare fee-for-service population increased gradually every year, from 311.5examinations in 2005 to a peak of 322.9 examinations in 2009, representing acompound annual growth rate of 0.9%. In 2010, the utilization rate abruptlydecreased by 4.3% to 309.2 examinations, and it has not since recovered topre-2010 levels. In 2015, 18.9% of screening and 16.2% of diagnostic digitalmammography examinations included DBT as an add-on procedure.CONCLUSION: In contrast to the annual increase in screening mammographyutilization from 2005 to 2009, an abrupt sustained decline in screening occurred beginning in 2010, coinciding with the release of U.S. Preventive Services TaskForce recommendations. DBT utilization was somewhat limited in 2015, occurring inconjunction with less than 20% of digital mammography examinations.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.18767 PMID: 29570370
