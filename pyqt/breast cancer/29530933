The primary analysisendpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). Biomarkers were examined as continuous or categorical variables (predefined cutoffs). Interaction terms betweenbiomarkers and treatment were assessed in multivariate Cox models adjusted forvariables of clinical interest.Results: A significant interaction was detectedbetween p27 and treatment (adjusted P = 0.0049). Trastuzumab effect wassignificant in the p27-low subgroup (≤70% p27-positive tumor cells; N = 318). HR Comb Trast vs. Obs 0.44, 95% CI, 0.29-0.65 (P < 0.001). No trastuzumab effect wasobserved in the p27-high subgroup N = 435; HR Comb Trast vs. Obs 0.97, 95% CI,0.66-1.44, P = 0.89), indicating that these patients derived little or no benefitfrom trastuzumab treatment. A prognostic effect of p27 on DFS was observed, with p27-high patients experiencing half the hazard of a DFS event compared with lowones (HR p27 High vs. Low 0.49, 95% CI, 0.32-0.75). TOP2A, Ki67, and cyclin D1,as categorical variables were not predictive, whereas cyclin D1 as continuousvariable was predictive of trastuzumab benefit.Conclusions: In TransHERA,patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer with low p27 expression in their tumors benefited from trastuzumab treatment, whereas patients with high p27expression did not.
