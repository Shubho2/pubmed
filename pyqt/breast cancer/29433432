One importanttool that has been addressing this issue is single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNASeq)that allows the quantification of expression profiles of transcripts inindividual cells in a population of cancer cells. Using the expression profilesfrom scRNASeq, current studies conduct analysis to group cells into differentsubpopulations using clustering algorithms. In this study, we explore scRNASeqcancer data from a different perspective. We focus on scRNASeq data originatingfrom cancer cells pertaining to a particular cancer type, where the cell type or the subpopulation to which each cell belongs is known. We investigate if the"cell type" of a cancer cell can be predicted based on the expression profiles ofa small set of transcripts.RESULTS: We outline a predictive analytics pipeline to accurately predict 6breast cancer cell types using single cell gene expression profiles. Instead ofbuilding predictive models using the complete human transcripts, the pipelinefirst eliminates predictors with low expression and low variance. A multinomialpenalized logistic regression further reduces the size of the predictors to only 308, out of which 34 are long non-coding RNAs. Tuning of predictive models shows support vector machines and neural networks as the most accurate models achievingclose to 98% prediction accuracies. We also find that mixture of protein codinggenes and long non-coding RNAs are better predictors compared to when the twosets of transcripts are treated separately. A signature risk score originatingfrom 65 protein coding genes and 5 lncRNA predictors is associated withprognostic survival of TCGA breast cancer patients. This association wasmaintained when the risk scores were generated using 65 PCGs and 5 lncRNAseparately. We further show that predictors restricted to a particular cell type serve as better prognostic markers for the respective patient subtype.CONCLUSION: Our results show that in general, the breast cancer cell typepredictors are also associated with patient survivability and hence have clinicalsignificance.DOI: 10.1186/s12864-018-4527-y PMCID: PMC5809864PMID: 29433432
