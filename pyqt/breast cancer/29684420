To identifynovel druggable targets and to understand its unique biology, we tried toimplement 24 patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of TNBC. The overall success rate of PDX implantation was 45%, much higher than estrogen receptor (ER)-positivecases. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed conserved ER/PR/Her2 negativity(with two exceptions) between the original and PDX tumors. Genomic analysis of 10primary tumor-PDX pairs with Ion AmpliSeq CCP revealed high degree of variantconservation (85.0%-96.9%) between primary and PDXs. Further analysis showed 44rare variants with a predicted high impact in 36 genes including Trp53, Pten,Notch1, and Col1a1. Among them, we confirmed frequent Notch1 variant.Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis of 24 PDXs revealed 594 gene fusions, of which 163 were in-frame, including AZGP1-GJC3 and NF1-AARSD1. Finally, western blotanalysis of oncogenic signaling proteins supporting molecular diversity of TNBCPDXs. Overall, our report provides a molecular basis for the usefulness of theTNBC PDX model in preclinical study.Published by Elsevier B.V.DOI: 10.1016/j.canlet.2018.04.020 PMID: 29684420
