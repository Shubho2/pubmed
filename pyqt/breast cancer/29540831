Here we investigated thenon-receptor tyrosine adhesion kinase FES-related (FER), following itsidentification as a potential mediator of sensitivity to IGF-1R kinase inhibitionin a functional siRNA screen. We found that FER and the IGF-1R co-locate in cellsand can be co-immunoprecipitated. Ectopic FER expression strongly enhanced IGF-1Rexpression and phosphorylation on tyrosines 950 and 1131. FER phosphorylatedthese sites in an IGF-1R kinase-independent manner and also enhancedIGF-1-mediated phosphorylation of SHC, and activation of either AKT orMAPK-signaling pathways in different cells. The IGF-1R, Î²1 Integrin, FER, and itssubstrate cortactin were all observed to co-locate in cell adhesion complexes,the disruption of which reduced IGF-1R expression and activity. High FERexpression correlates with phosphorylation of SHC in breast cancer cell lines andwith a poor prognosis in patient cohorts. FER and SHC phosphorylation and IGF-1R expression could be suppressed with a known anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor (AP26113) that shows high specificity for FER kinase. Overall, we conclude thatFER enhances IGF-1R expression, phosphorylation, and signaling to promotecooperative growth and adhesion signaling that may facilitate cancer progression.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-017-0113-z PMID: 29540831
