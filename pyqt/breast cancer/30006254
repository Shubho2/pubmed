Electronic address: amit.agrawal@addenbrookes.nhs.uk.INTRODUCTION: Oncoplastic breast surgery (OBS) can be applied in larger tumors orin patients with high tumor-to-breast ratio without compromising oncologicsafety. Inherent larger excisions may increase the probability of clear margins. We compare postoperative outcomes between simple wide local excision (WLE) andOBS assuming 3 different margin distances.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Single oncoplastic surgeon data between April 2014 andSeptember 2016, including tumor and treatment details, for WLE or OBS werereviewed. Relative incidence of margin positivity at 3 assumed distinct margindistances (2, 1, and 0 mm) and reexcision rates were compared. Statisticalcomparisons were performed by the Student t and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Available data from 201 patients revealed similar patient age andrespective tumor phenotypes between 2 cohorts (166 WLE and 35 OBS). Though boththe preoperative (30 vs. 16 mm, P < .001) and postoperative tumor (30 vs. 19 mm, P = .001) sizes were greater in the OBS group, margin positivity rates weresignificantly lower, at 1 mm (5.7% vs. 20.8%, P = .036). Though similar rates of reexcision were observed, completion mastectomies were required in 5.4% of WLEversus 0 OBS. Similar rates of margin positivity and reexcision were observedbetween mammoplasties and chest wall perforator flaps.CONCLUSION: OBS is not inferior to standard WLE at providing a safe and clearoncologic margin regardless of margin distance (up to 2 mm) despite larger tumor size. The additional benefit of improved cosmesis, particularly in patients with larger tumor-to-breast ratio, offers a suitable and safe alternative, thusincreasing patient choice and reducing the incidence of reexcision and completionmastectomy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
