Surgery to remove the primary tumour isassociated with an increased survival in other types of metastatic cancer. Breastsurgery is not standard treatment for metastatic disease, however several recent retrospective studies have suggested that breast surgery could increase thewomen's survival. These studies have methodological limitations includingselection bias. A systematic review mapping all randomised controlled trialsaddressing the benefits and potential harms of breast surgery is ideal to answer this question.OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of breast surgery in women with metastaticbreast cancer.SEARCH METHODS: We conducted searches using the MeSH terms 'breast neoplasms','mastectomy', and 'analysis, survival' in the following databases: the CochraneBreast Cancer Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (by PubMed) and Embase (byOvidSP) on 22 February 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov (22 February2016) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (24 February2016). We conducted an additional search in the American Society of ClinicalOncology (ASCO) conference proceedings in July 2016 that included referencechecking, citation searching, and contacting study authors to identify additionalstudies.SELECTION CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials ofwomen with metastatic breast cancer at initial diagnosis comparing breast surgeryplus systemic therapy versus systemic therapy alone. The primary outcomes wereoverall survival and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were progression-freesurvival (local and distant control), breast cancer-specific survival, andtoxicity from local therapy.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently conducted trialselection, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessment (using Cochrane's 'Riskof bias' tool), which a third review author checked. We used the GRADE tool toassess the quality of the body of evidence. We used the risk ratio (RR) tomeasure the effect of treatment for dichotomous outcomes and the hazard ratio(HR) for time-to-event outcomes. We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these measures. We used the random-effects model, as we expected clinical ormethodological heterogeneity, or both, among the included studies.MAIN RESULTS: We included two trials enrolling 624 women in the review. It isuncertain whether breast surgery improves overall survival as the quality of the evidence has been assessed as very low (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.31; 2 studies; 624 women). The two studies did not report quality of life. Breast surgery mayimprove local progression-free survival (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.57; 2 studies;607 women; low-quality evidence), while it probably worsened distantprogression-free survival (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.86; 1 study; 350 women;moderate-quality evidence). The two included studies did not measure breastcancer-specific survival. Toxicity from local therapy was reported by 30-daymortality and did not appear to differ between the two groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI0.14 to 6.90; 1 study; 274 women; low-quality evidence).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on existing evidence from two randomised clinicaltrials, it is not possible to make definitive conclusions on the benefits andrisks of breast surgery associated with systemic treatment for women diagnosedwith metastatic breast cancer. Until the ongoing clinical trials are finalised,the decision to perform breast surgery in these women should be individualisedand shared between the physician and the patient considering the potential risks,benefits, and costs of each intervention.DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011276.pub2 PMID: 29542106  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
