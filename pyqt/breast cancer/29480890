Inrare patients with extensive metastatic disease to the femur, total femurreplacement may be the only surgical alternative to amputation; however, littleis known about this approach.QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In a highly selected small group of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the femur, we asked: (1) What was the patient survivorship afterthis treatment? (2) What was the implant survivorship free from all-causerevision and amputation, and what complications were associated with thistreatment? (3) What functional outcomes were achieved by patients after totalfemur replacement for this indication?METHODS: Eleven patients (three men, eight women) with a mean age of 64 years(range, 41-78 years) received total femur replacements between 1986 and 2016;none were lost to followup. The most common primary disease was breast cancer. Ingeneral, during this period, our indications for this procedure were extensivemetastatic disease precluding internal fixation or isolated proximal or distalfemur replacement, and an anticipated lifespan exceeding 6 months. Ourcontraindication for this procedure during this time was expected lifespan lessthan 6 months. Patient survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis; implantsurvival free from revision surgery and amputation were assessed by competingrisk analysis. Function was determined preoperatively and 6 to 12 weekspostoperatively with the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score normalized toa 100-point scale, with higher scores representing better function from alongitudinally maintained institutional database.RESULTS: Eleven patients died at a median of 5 months (range, 1-31 months) after surgery. One-year revision-free and limb survival were 82% (95% CI, 51%-98%) and 91% (95% CI, 61%-99%), respectively. Reasons for reoperation were hipdislocation, infection and local recurrence in one patient each. The latter twocomplications resulted in amputation in two patients. The median MSTS score was32 (range, 13-57).CONCLUSIONS: Despite attempts to select patients who might have anticipatedgreater life expectancy, eight of 11 patients died by 6 months after surgery, andan additional two patients had undergone an amputation at 8 and at 17 monthspostoperatively. Most patients undergoing total femur replacement in this series did not recover from the procedure by the time they died, despite our bestattempts to perform the procedure in patients whom we thought would live at least6 months. Based on this, we believe that most patients with extensive metastatic disease to the femur should be offered palliative care, rather than majorreconstruction.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.DOI: 10.1007/s11999.0000000000000125 PMID: 29480890
