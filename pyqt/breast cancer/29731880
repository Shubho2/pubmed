China.The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of transactivationresponse RNA-binding protein (TARBP)1 and its clinical significance in humannon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TARBP1 expression at the mRNA level wasdetected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR) in 10 NSCLC tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues. TARBP1 protein expression was analyzed in 90 paraffin-embedded NSCLC tissue samples and pairedadjacent normal tissues by immunohistochemistry. Statistical analyses wereperformed to assess the clinicopathological significance of TARBP1 expression.The expression of TARBP1 mRNA was higher in the 10 NSCLC samples than in thepaired adjacent non-tumor tissues (P=0.0017). In the paraffin-embedded tissuesamples, the expression level of TARBP1 was higher in the cancer tissues than in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. TARBP1 expression was detected in 76.67%(69/90) of the NSCLC samples and in 22.22% (20/90) of the adjacent normal lungtissues (P<0.001). The expression of TARBP1 was significantly associated withhistological grade (P<0.001), clinical stage (P=0.024) and pathological type(P<0.001), along with a decreased overall survival (OS) rate (P<0.001). Onmultivariate analysis, the expression of TARBP1 was an independent prognosticfactor for hazard ratio (OS, 2.729; 95% confidence interval, 1.471-5.061;P=0.003). TARBP1 is overexpressed in NSCLC, and the expression of TARBP1 isassociated with pathological grade, clinical stage and pathological type. Thus,TARBP1 may be an independent prognostic marker in patients with NSCLC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8202 PMCID: PMC5920659PMID: 29731880
