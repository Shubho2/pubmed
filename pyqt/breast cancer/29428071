Breastcancer is the most common type of cancer that affects the female populationaround the world. It is also the most deadly type of cancer among women. It isthe second most common type of cancer among all others. The most commonexamination to diagnose breast cancer early is mammography. In the last decades, computational techniques have been developed with the purpose of automaticallydetecting structures that maybe associated with tumors in mammographyexamination. This work presents a computational methodology to automaticallydetection of mass regions in mammography by using a convolutional neural network.METHODS: The materials used in this work is the DDSM database. The methodproposed consists of two phases: training phase and test phase. The trainingphase has 2 main steps: (1) create a model to classify breast tissue into denseand non-dense (2) create a model to classify regions of breast into mass andnon-mass. The test phase has 7 step: (1) preprocessing; (2) registration; (3)segmentation; (4) first reduction of false positives; (5) preprocessing ofregions segmented; (6) density tissue classification (7) second reduction offalse positives where regions will be classified into mass and non-mass.RESULTS: The proposed method achieved 95.6% of accuracy in classify non-densebreasts tissue and 97,72% accuracy in classify dense breasts. To detect regionsof mass in non-dense breast, the method achieved a sensitivity value of 91.5%,and specificity value of 90.7%, with 91% accuracy. To detect regions in densebreasts, our method achieved 90.4% of sensitivity and 96.4% of specificity, with accuracy of 94.8%.CONCLUSIONS: According to the results achieved by CNN, we demonstrate thefeasibility of using convolutional neural networks on medical image processingtechniques for classification of breast tissue and mass detection.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
