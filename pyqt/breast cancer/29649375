Podocalyxin (PODXL) is a highly glycosylated type I transmembrane proteinthat is expressed in normal tissues, including the heart, pancreas, and breast.It is also found and used as a diagnostic marker in many cancers, such as renal, brain, breast, oral, and lung cancers. We previously developed specific andsensitive anti-PODXL monoclonal antibodies, PcMab-47 (mouse IgG1, kappa) and its mouse IgG2a-type (47-mG2a), both of which were suitable for immunohistochemicalanalyses of oral cancers. In this study, we investigated the utility of PcMab-47 and 47-mG2a for the immunohistochemical analyses of lung cancers. PcMab-47stained 51/70 (72.9%) cases of lung cancer, whereas 47-mG2a stained 59/70 (84.3%)cases, indicating that the latter antibody is more sensitive and is useful fordetecting PODXL in lung cancers.DOI: 10.1089/mab.2018.0002 PMID: 29649375
