Before TP53 signature can be used in a clinical setting, a simple and low-cost diagnostic system using formalin-fixedparaffin-embedded (FFPE) samples is needed. New treatments based on thebiological characteristics of TP53 signature are expected to follow.Experimental Design: TP53 signature was evaluated in 174 FFPE early breast cancerspecimens using digital quantification via the nCounter technique (NanoString).Patients were classified as TP53 signature mutant type (n = 64) or wild type (n =110). Predictive power of TP53 signature was compared with those of other geneexpression signatures in 153 fresh-frozen samples of the same cohort by RNA-seq. The molecular features of TP53 signature were elucidated using TCGA omics dataand RNA-seq data to explore new therapeutic strategies for patients with TP53signature mutant type.Results: TP53 signature was a strong predictor of prognosis and was also moreaccurate than other gene expression signatures and independent of otherclinicopathological factors. TCGA data analysis showed that risk score of TP53signature was an index of chromosomal and genomic instability and that TP53signature mutant type was associated with higher PD-L1 expression, variation incopy numbers, and numbers of somatic mutations.Conclusions: TP53 signature as diagnosed using the nCounter system is not only a robust predictor of prognosis but also a potential predictor of responsiveness toimmune checkpoint inhibitors.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24447 PMCID: PMC5865663PMID: 29581837
