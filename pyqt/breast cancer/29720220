The additional value of texture pattern scores on top of volumetric mammographic density measures in alarge screening cohort has never been studied.METHODS: Volumetric mammographic density and texture pattern scores were assessedautomatically for the first available digital mammography (DM) screeningexamination of 51,400 women (50-75 years of age) participating in the Dutchbiennial breast cancer screening program between 2003 and 2011. The textureassessment method was developed in a previous study and validated in the current study. Breast cancer information was obtained from the screening registrationsystem and through linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Allscreen-detected breast cancers diagnosed at the first available digital screeningexamination were excluded. During a median follow-up period of 4.2 (interquartilerange (IQR) 2.0-6.2) years, 301 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. Theassociations between texture pattern scores, volumetric breast density measuresand breast cancer risk were determined using Cox proportional hazard analyses.Discriminatory performance was assessed using c-indices.RESULTS: The median age of the women at the time of the first available digitalmammography examination was 56 years (IQR 51-63). Texture pattern scores werepositively associated with breast cancer risk (hazard ratio (HR) 3.16 (95% CI2.16-4.62) (p value for trend <0.001), for quartile (Q) 4 compared to Q1). Thec-index of texture was 0.61 (95% CI 0.57-0.64). Dense volume and percentage densevolume showed positive associations with breast cancer risk (HR 1.85 (95% CI1.32-2.59) (p value for trend <0.001) and HR 2.17 (95% CI 1.51-3.12) (p value fortrend <0.001), respectively, for Q4 compared to Q1). When adding texture measuresto models with dense volume or percentage dense volume, c-indices increased from 0.56 (95% CI 0.53-0.59) to 0.62 (95% CI 0.58-0.65) (p < 0.001) and from 0.58 (95%CI 0.54-0.61) to 0.60 (95% CI 0.57-0.63) (p = 0.054), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Deep-learning-based texture pattern scores, measured automaticallyon digital mammograms, are associated with breast cancer risk, independently ofvolumetric mammographic density, and augment the capacity to discriminate betweenfuture breast cancer and non-breast cancer cases.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0961-7 PMCID: PMC5932877PMID: 29720220
