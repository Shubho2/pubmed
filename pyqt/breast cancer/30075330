Hence, we assessed theirassociations with risk of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers within thispopulation.METHODS: The study comprised a subcohort of 3185 women from a cohort of 39,532female participants who completed self-administered lifestyle and dietaryquestionnaires at enrollment. During a median follow-up of approximately12.2years, we ascertained 922, 180 and 104 breast, endometrial and ovarian cancercases, respectively. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models modified for the case-cohort design to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations of coffee, tea and caffeine with risk ofselected cancers.RESULTS: Coffee, tea, and caffeine intake were not associated with overall riskof breast and ovarian cancers. There was, however, a tendency towards anincreased risk of breast cancer with increasing levels of total coffee,caffeinated coffee and/or caffeine among premenopausal and normal weight women.Total coffee, caffeinated coffee, and caffeine were inversely associated withrisk of endometrial cancer (HRper cup increase: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79-0.95, HRpercup increase: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.80-0.96 and HRper 100mg increase: 0.93; 95% CI:0.87-0.99, respectively).CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that coffee and/or caffeine may be associatedwith reduced risk of endometrial cancer but, probably, associated increased with risk of breast cancer among premenopausal or normal weight women. However,further studies are needed to confirm our findings.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.canep.2018.07.013 PMID: 30075330
