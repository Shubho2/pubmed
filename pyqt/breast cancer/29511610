Here, we show thatKi-67 is post-transcriptionally regulated through alternative polyadenylation(APA) and microRNAs in breast cancer. We show that shortening of the Ki-67 3'UTR results in the loss of the binding sites for the suppressive miRNAs and thusrenders the transcript with a shortened 3'UTR insusceptible to miRNA-mediatedsuppression. This APA-mediated shortening of the Ki-67 3'UTR contributes toincreased mRNA stability and enhanced translational efficiency. In summary, ourresults not only highlight the post-transcriptional regulation of Ki-67 involvingAPA and microRNAs but also suggest that Ki-67 3'UTR disruption could serve as amolecular marker in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1002/2211-5463.12364 PMCID: PMC5832968PMID: 29511610
