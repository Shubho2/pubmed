Parthenolide is the main compound in feverfew that has been used to cure migraineand rheumatoid arthritis for long time. Parthenolide has been predominatelyinvestigated as inducer of apoptosis in human cancer cells.PURPOSE: We examined the expression of vimentin and Elongation factor α - 1 asbreast cancer biomarkers in MCF7 cells exposure to Parthenolide.METHOD: In this study, we investigated the antitumor mechanism of Parthenolide onthe human breast cancer cell line MCF7, using SEM, flow cytometry and proteomics techniques.RESULT: Comparative proteome analyses are shown Elongation factor1-α and vimentinwas suppressed in response to Parthenolide treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
