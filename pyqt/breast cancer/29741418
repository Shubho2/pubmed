In this study, evaluationwas made to determine efficiency of gold-silica shell-core NP in megavoltageirradiation of MCF7 breath cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gold-silicon oxide shell-core NPs were obtained byconjugation of gold NP with amine or thiol functionalized silica NPs (AuN@SiO2and AuS@SiO2). Cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of NPs were examined byfluorescent microscopy and MTT assay, respectively. MCF-7 breast cancer cellswere treated with both NPs and irradiation was made with X-ray energies of 6 and 18 MV to the absorbed dose of 2, 4 and 8 Gy using Simense linear accelerator. Theefficiency of radiation therapy was then evaluated by MTT and Brdu assay, DAPIstaining and cell cycle analysis.RESULTS: TEM images indicated that synthesized NPs had average diameter of 25 nm.Cellular uptake demonstrated that the internalization of AuS@SiO2 and AuN@SiO2NPs amounted to 18% and 34%, 3 h post treatment, respectively. Nontoxicity ofprepared NPs on MCF-7 cells was proved by MTT and Brdu assays as well as DAPIstaining and cell cycle studies. The highest enhancement in radiation dose wasobserved in the cells that irradiated with radiation energy of 18 MV and absorbedof 8 Gy at NPs concentration of 200 ppm. The Brdu findings revealed that thecytotoxicity and apoptosis on MCF-7 cells are dose dependent with a significantlymore death in AuN@SiO2 (amine) exposed cells (p < .05). Analysis also revealedinterruption in cell cycle by demonstrating lack of cells, in S phase in aminetreated cells (AuN@SiO2) at given dose of 8 Gy using 18 MV X-ray in comparison tothiol treated cells.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of the study it can be concluded that thegold-silicon oxide shell-core NPs could play an effective role in radiotherapy ofMCF-7 breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1470526 PMID: 29741418
