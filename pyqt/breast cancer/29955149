However,the underlying mechanisms of lymphovascular invasion and its driver molecules in breast cancer remain to be defined. In this study, we explore differentialexpression of genes in large molecularly characterized and clinically annotateddatasets of invasive breast cancer patients (n = 8056) coupled with histological review and strict definition for lymphovascular invasion status. The METABRICseries was used to identify genes associated with lymphovascular invasion, asdefined using hematoxylin and eosin staining supplemented byimmunohistochemistry, at the genomic/transcriptomic levels. Saccharomycescerevisiae-like 1 (SEC14L1) was identified as one of the most significant genesassociated with lymphovascular invasion. The prognostic significance of SEC14L1gene copy number and mRNA expression was further investigated in the METABRICseries and externally validated using the Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Minerv4.0. Protein expression of SEC14L1 was also assessed using immunohistochemistry in series of early stage breast cancer using tissue microarrays. SEC14L1 genecopy number gain was significantly associated with high histological grade andpoor outcome. SEC14L1 mRNA expression showed positive association with highergrade, lymph node metastasis, and poor outcome. SEC14L1 protein overexpressionwas significantly associated with lymphovascular invasion (p < 0.0001), highergrade (p = 0.011), HER2 positivity (p = 0.036), and shorter survival(p = 0.00075). Our findings specify SEC14L1 as an independent prognostic factorin breast cancer. Its association, at both transcriptome and protein expressionlevels, with lymphovascular invasion and outcome could imply an important role intumor progression. A further mechanistic insight into its molecular rolesincluding potential therapeutic utility is warranted.DOI: 10.1038/s41379-018-0092-9 PMID: 29955149
