While many mechanisms have been suggested for the action of trastuzumab, most of them are not substantiated by experimental data. It has been suggestedthat trastuzumab functions by inhibiting intracellular signaling initiated byHER2, however, the data are very controversial. A major issue is the differentcellular background of various breast cancer cells lines used in these studies.Each breast cancer cell line has a unique expression profile of various HERreceptors, which could significantly affect the effects of trastuzumab.METHODS: To overcome this problem, in this research we adopted a cell model that allow us to specifically examine the effects of trastuzumab on a single HERreceptor without the influence of other HER receptors. Three CHO cell linesstably expressing only human EGFR (CHO-EGFR), HER2 (CHO-K6), or HER3 (CHO-HER3)were used. Various methods including cytotoxicity assay, immunoblotting, indirectimmunofluorescence, cross linking, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity(ADCC) were employed in this research.RESULTS: We showed that trastuzumab did not bind EGFR and HER3, and thus did not affect the homodimerization and phosphorylation of EGFR and HER3. However,overexpression of HER2 in CHO cells, in the absence of other HER receptors,resulted in the homodimerization of HER2 and the phosphorylation of HER2 at allmajor pY residues. Trastuzumab bound to HER2 specifically and with high affinity.Trastuzumab inhibited neither the homodimerization of HER2, nor thephosphorylation of HER2 at most phosphotyrosine residues. Moreover, trastuzumabdid not inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK and AKTÂ in CHO-K6 cells, and did notinhibit the proliferation of CHO-K6 cells. However, trastuzumab induced strongADCC in CHO-K6 cells.CONCLUSION: We concluded that, in the absence of other HER receptors, trastuzumabexerts its antitumor activity through the induction of ADCC, rather than theinhibition of HER2-homodimerization and phosphorylation.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4143-x PMCID: PMC5831215PMID: 29490608
