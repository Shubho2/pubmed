Electronic address: lizg@pkusz.edu.cn.Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a crucial target for ERα positive breast cancertreatment. Previous drug discovery efforts were focused on developing inhibitors that targeted the canonical ligand binding pockets of the ligand binding domain(LBD) of ERα. However, significant percentage of patients developed cancerrelapse with drug-resistance. ERα peptidomimetic modulators have been considered as promising treatments for drug resistant breast cancers as they are targetingERα-coactivator interacting interface instead of the ligand binding pocket ofERα. Herein, we reviewed the recent development of ERα peptidomimeticsantagonists.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2018.05.062 PMID: 30025900
