Expression of cMETwas assessed by IHC using rabbit monoclonal anti-total cMET antibody (SP44 fromVentana). Staining intensity was scored on a scale of 0, 1+, 2+ and 3+. cMEToverexpression was defined as at least moderate membranous/cytoplasmic stainingin ≥50% of tumor cells (score ≥ 2+). FISH analysis was performed using MET (7q31)specific probe (BAC clone RP11-95i20, Abbott Molecular Inc.) and the centromereprobe (CEP7/D7Z1, Abbott Molecular Inc.) as internal control. cMET amplification was defined as gene copy numbers ≥4 per cell or cMET/CEP7 ratio ≥ 2. cMET status was tested for correlation using Fisher's exact test with otherclinicopathological parameters. The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used toestimate the survival outcomes. Cox proportional hazards models were fit todetermine the association of cMET status by IHC, or by FISH, or by copy numberwith survival outcomes after adjustment for other patient and diseasecharacteristics.RESULTS: Medium follow up is 69.4 months (range 9-317 months). cMET wassuccessfully evaluated by both IHC and FISH methods in ninety-six patients. Therewere 13 patients whose tumors overexpressed cMET was by IHC. Two patients hadcMET amplification by FISH using definitive of cMET/CEP7 ratio of ≥2 and fourpatients had cMET copy number >4. Only one patient showed cMET/CEP7 ratio of 2.53and one was positive for cMET overexpression by IHC. No significant associationbetween cMET overexpression by IHC and by FISH using cut-off of with eithercMET/CEP7 ratio of ≥2 or cMET copy number of >4 (P = 1.0). There was nosignificant correlation between the cMET overexpression and otherclinicopathological characteristics, such as patient demographics, tumor grade,stage, or chemotherapy treatment history. cMET overexpression and geneamplification did not correlate with the prognosis of TNBC regarding OS or DFS.CONCLUSION: MET amplification is a rare incidence in TNBCs. cMET overexpressionis infrequent in TNBCs and may not be driven by gene amplification. Neither have significant prognostic value nor do they correlate with other clinicopathologicalcharacteristics in this TNBC cohort.Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2018.04.004 PMID: 29843069
