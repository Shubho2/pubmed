Wehypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HSF1 gene mightaffect its expression or function which might have an influence on thedevelopment of breast cancer. The study group included 242 individuals (146breast cancer patients and 96 healthy controls). From the cancer patients,genomic DNA was extracted from 96 blood samples and 50 Formalin-Fixed ParaffinEmbedded (FFPE) tissues, while from the controls DNA were extracted from bloodonly. Genotype was carried out for four SNPs in the HSF1 gene (rs78202224,rs35253356, rs4977219 and rs34404564) using Taqman genotyping assay method. TheHSF1 expression was investigated using immunohistochemistry on FFPE tissues(cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue). The SNP rs78202224 (G>T) wassignificantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer. The combined TT + GT genotype (OR: 6.91; p: 0.035) and the T allele showed high risk (OR: 5.81;p:0.0085) for breast cancer development. The SNP rs34404564 (A>G) had aprotective effect against the development of breast cancer. The genotype AG (OR: 0.41; p = 0.0059) and GG+AG (OR: 0.52; p: 0.026) occurred at a significantlylower frequency in the breast cancer patients compared to the frequency inhealthy controls. No significant relationship was identified between eitherrs35253356 (A>G) or rs4977219 (A>C) and breast cancer in Saudi. The HSF1 protein expression was higher in all invasive and in situ breast carcinoma compared tothe normal tissue. A stronger positive staining for HSF1 was found in the nucleuscompared to the cytoplasm. Our results show that HSF1 gene expression is elevatedin breast cancer tissue and two of the studied SNPs correlate significantly with cancer development.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193095 PMCID: PMC5832201PMID: 29494616  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
