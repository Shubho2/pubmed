However, the function and mechanism of most KZNFs remain unclear. Here, we report that ZNF496, a KZNF family member, interacts withthe DNA binding domain (DBD) of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) via its C2H2domain. This interaction decreases ERα binding to chromatin DNA and results inthe repression of ERα transactivation, the selective suppression of ERα targetgenes, and ultimately in a reduction of ERα-positive cell growth in the presence of E2. An analysis of clinical data revealed that the downregulation of ZNF496expression is observed only in ERα-positive and not in ERα-negative breast cancertissues when compared with that in matched adjacent tissues. Lastly, we alsoobserved that the downregulation of ZNF496 is associated with poorrecurrence-free survival among patients with breast cancer. Collectively, ourfindings demonstrate that ZNF496 is a novel ERα-binding protein that acts as atarget gene-specific ERα corepressor and inhibits the growth of ERα-positivebreast cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
