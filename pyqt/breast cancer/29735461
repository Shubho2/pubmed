However,anthracycline has great cardiotoxicity. Some patients stop chemotherapy duringsevere chemotherapy and even undergo serious heart failure. At the same time,there is lack of clinical study on whether aerobic exercise can reduce thecardiotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs. The purpose of this study is to investigatethe effects of aerobic exercise on the cardiac function of patients with breastcancer after anthracycline therapy. The results showed that the control groupLVEF decreased significantly. In addition, the E/A value decreased and the DTinterval prolonged in the control group, show that anthracycline on myocardialdamage, and the observation group LVEF increased significantly (P<0.05), theresults show that aerobic exercise can improve heart function, and to a certainextent, it could reverse the damage of chemotherapy drugs on the heart.PMID: 29735461
