Electronicaddress: selvamn2@yahoo.com.We previously reported that ATF3 and Runx2 are involved in breast cancerprogression and bone metastasis. The expression of these genes can be controlled by post-transcriptional regulators such as microRNAs (miRNAs). In this study, we identified and validated the functional role of miR-590-3p in human breast cancercells (MDA-MB231). There was an inverse correlation between the expression ofmiR-590-3p and its putative target genes, ATF3 and Runx2 in these cells.Overexpression of miR-590-3p decreased the expression of ATF3 and Runx2 at themRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB231 cells. Luciferase reporter assay identified a direct interaction of 3' UTRs of ATF3 and Runx2 with miR-590-3p in these cells.Overexpression of miR-590-3p also decreased proliferation and increased apoptosisof breast cancer cells. Based on our results, we suggest that miR-590-3p mighthave potential clinical applications towards controlling breast cancerprogression and bone metastasis.Copyright Â© 2018.
