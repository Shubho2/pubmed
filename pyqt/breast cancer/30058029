Repeatbiopsies, however, are not always possible. In this feasibility trial we assessedwhether 89Zr-trastuzumab PET could support diagnostic understanding and aidclinical decision making, when HER2 status could not be determined by standardwork up. Additionally, HER2 status on circulating tumour cells (CTCs) wasassessed.PATIENTS AND METHODS: 89Zr-trastuzumab PET was performed in patients if diseaseHER2 status remained unclear after standard work up (bone scan, 18F-FDG PET, CTand if feasible a biopsy). PET result and central pathologic revision ofavailable tumour biopsies were reported to the referring physician. CTC HER2status prior to PET was evaluated afterwards and therefore not reported.Diagnostic understanding and treatment decision questionnaires were completed by the referring physicians before, directly after and ≥ 3 months after89Zr-trastuzumab PET.RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled: 8 with two primary cancers (HER2-positiveand HER2-negative BC or BC and non-BC), 7 with metastases inaccessible forbiopsy, 4 with prior HER2-positive and -negative metastases and 1 with primary BCwith equivocal HER2 status. 89Zr-trastuzumab PET was positive in 12 patients,negative in 7 and equivocal in 1 patient. In 15/20 patients, 89Zr-trastuzumab PETsupported treatment decision. The scan altered treatment of 8 patients, increasedphysicians' confidence without affecting treatment in 10, and improvedphysicians' disease understanding in 18 patients. In 10/20 patients CTCs weredetected; 6/10 showed HER2 expression. CTC HER2 status was not correlated to89Zr-trastuzumab PET result or treatment decision.CONCLUSION: 89Zr-trastuzumab PET supports clinical decision making when HER2status cannot be determined by standard work up. The impact of CTC HER2 statusneeds to be further explored.DOI: 10.1007/s00259-018-4099-8 PMID: 30058029
