Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), weaspired to identify the optimal differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for use as prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: NGS was used to determine transcriptome profiles in breastcancer tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal tissues from threepatients with breast cancer.RESULTS: Herein, 15 DEGs (fold change >4 and <0.25) involved in extracellularmatrix (ECM)-receptor interaction signaling were identified through NGS. Amongthem, our data indicated that high HMMR expression levels were correlated with a poor pathological stage (p<0.001) and large tumor size (p<0.001), whereas highCOL6A6 and Reelin (RELN) expression levels were significantly correlated with an early pathological stage (COL6A6: p=0.003 and RELN: p<0.001). Multivariateanalysis revealed that high HMMR and SDC1 expression levels were significantlycorrelated with poor overall survival (OS; HMMR: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.10-3.41, p=0.023; SDC1: [aHR] 2.47,95%CI=1.28-4.77, p=0.007) for breast cancer. Combined, the effects of HMMR andSDC1 showed a significant correlation with poor OS for patients with breastcancer (high expression for both HMMR and SDC1: [aHR] 3.29, 95%CI=1.52-7.12,p=0.003).CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HMMR and SDC1 involved in theECM-receptor interaction signaling pathway could act as effective independentprognostic biomarkers for breast ductal carcinoma.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12764 PMID: 30061226  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
