Further analysis of a subgroupwas done to study clinically defined subtypes and the role of preanalyticalfactors in needle core biopsies (NCBs) and excised specimens.Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study from January 2010 toDecember 2016. Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and availableimmunohistochemistry (IHC) reports of ER, PR, and HER2 status were analyzed. The cases for the year 2016 were analyzed further to observe the impact ofpreanalytical factors on the IHC staining patterns and surrogate status.Results: A total of 5436 patients were included with a median age of 48 years.Among these, 65% were â‰¤ 55 years. The overall incidence of hormone receptor(HR)-positive patients was 48%; HER2 positive, 15%; and triple-negative breastcancer (TNBC), 37%. The incidence of HR positive, HER2 positive, and TNBC were45%, 16%, and 39% and 53%, 13%, and 34% in patients <56 years and over 55 years, respectively (P < 0.001). There was an increase in HR positivity and decrease in TNBCs over time. There was no significant difference in the staining patterns in NCBs and excised specimens.Conclusion: With time, there is an increase in hormone-positive tumors which may be attributed to better IHC techniques and tissue handling. There was nostatistical difference in the patterns of ER, PR, and HER2 immunostaining in corebiopsy and excised specimens.DOI: 10.4103/sajc.sajc_211_17 PMCID: PMC5865104PMID: 29600224
