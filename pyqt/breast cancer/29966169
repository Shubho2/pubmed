Objectivity, accuracy, and harm in imaging for cancer.Reid L(1).Author information: (1)Department of Bioethics, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.Assumptions about the epistemic ideal of objectivity, closely related toontological assumptions about the nature of disease as pathophysiologicalabnormality, lead us into oversimplified ways of thinking about medical imaging. This is illustrated by current controversies in the early detection of cancer.Improvements in the technical quality of imaging failed to address the problem ofoverdiagnosis in breast cancer screening and exacerbate the problem in thyroidcancer diagnosis. Drawing on Douglas and on Daston and Galison, I distinguish 3dimensions of objectivity (accuracy, reliability, and precision) and demonstrate ways they may be at odds, as illustrated in the early detection of cancer.Guidelines for evaluating the efficacy of diagnostic imaging are insufficientlysensitive to this complexity. Improving imaging quality may raise epistemicissues, place disease definitions in question, and lead to overall harm or tochanges in the distribution of harms and benefits among population subgroups.With a nod to Wittgenstein, I argue that we cannot take for granted that "anindistinct picture" is not "exactly what we need."Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/jep.12965 PMID: 29966169
