This study has been designed to address this limitation by exploring the benefit of two structured psychotherapeutic interventions, crisiscounseling and psychoeducation, in enhancing breast cancer patients'psychological well-being, quality of life and treatment compliance in Qatar.Methods: A total of 201 women with early-stage breast cancer from the state ofQatar were recruited and randomized into either the control group or one of thetreatment groups (crisis counseling or psychoeducation). Each of the twotreatment interventions consisted of a total of six 60- to 90-minute sessions,which were provided over a period of 12 weeks. The short- and long-term benefits of the crisis counseling and psychoeducation interventions were evaluated interms of improving patients' psychological well-being, quality of life andtreatment compliance by asking all the patients to complete the Depression,Anxiety and Stress Scale, 21 item version (DASS-21) and European Organization forResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life scale (QLQ-C30) instruments atdifferent points in time and by monitoring their compliance to chemotherapy andradiotherapy treatment.Results: This study revealed that both of the study interventions, crisiscounseling and psychoeducation, were effective in improving women's psychologicalwell-being and quality of life over time in comparison to the control group, but had no significant impact on patients' compliance with treatment. In addition,the study showed that psychoeducation conferred a greater advantage than did the crisis counseling model, especially in improving women's psychological well-beingover time.Conclusion: This study is considered the first of its kind in Qatar to provideevidence on the benefit of crisis counseling and psychoeducation interventions inimproving the psychological well-being and quality of life of women withearly-stage breast cancer in Qatar. In addition, this study has providedinnovative research that can be used as evidence to propose changes to thepsychotherapy services for breast cancer patients in Qatar. This research studyaims to provide a first step toward further research in the future, which willhopefully lead to a better health care system for cancer patients in Qatar.DOI: 10.2147/IJWH.S161840 PMCID: PMC5995281PMID: 29922098
