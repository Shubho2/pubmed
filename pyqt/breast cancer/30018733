Understanding gene-environmentinteractions could play a critical role for next stage of BC prevention efforts. Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the key gene-environmentalfactors affecting the risks of BC in a diverse sample. Five genes in one-carbonmetabolism pathway including MTHFR 677, MTHFR 1298, MTR 2756, MTRR 66, and DHFR19bp together with demographics, lifestyle, and dietary intake factors wereexamined in association with BC risks. A total of 80 participants (40 BC casesand 40 family/friend controls) in southern California were interviewed andprovided salivary samples for genotyping. We presented the first study utilizing both conventional and new analytics including ensemble method and predictivemodeling based on smallest errors to predict BC risks. Predictive modeling ofGeneralized Regression Elastic Net Leave-One-Out demonstrated alcohol use (p =0.0126) and age (p < 0.0001) as significant predictors; and significantinteractions were noted between body mass index (BMI) and alcohol use (p =0.0027), and between BMI and MTR 2756 polymorphisms (p = 0.0090). Our findingsidentified the modifiable lifestyle factors in gene-environment interactions thatare valuable for BC prevention.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25520 PMCID: PMC6044380PMID: 30018733
