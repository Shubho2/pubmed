We report a modified PAP flap design,including not only a vertical extension that increases its volume but also theskin surface, which suits larger breasts requiring immediate or delayed breastreconstructions and compare the results with our horizontal skin paddle PAP flap experience.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  In our center between November 2014 and November 2016, 51 consecutive patients underwent a PAP flap breast reconstruction following breast cancer. A retrospective analysis on the collected data was performed to compare34 patients with a bra cup smaller than C who underwent 41 horizontal PAP flapprocedures, with those (n = 17) of a bra cup greater than or equal to C whounderwent 21 fleur-de-lys PAP flap procedures. Demographic, anthropometric, flap and surgical characteristics, postoperative complication rates, and hospital staywere compared between the two groups.RESULTS:  The average flap weight was 480 g (range: 340-735 g) for thefleur-de-lys PAP flap group compared with 222 g (range: 187-325 g) for thehorizontal PAP flap procedure (p < 0.001). The mean flap dimensions were 25 × 18 cm for the fleur-de-lys PAP flap group compared with 25 × 7 cm in the horizontal PAP flap group. No flap failure was observed in the fleur-de-lys PAP flap groupcompared with two flap failures secondary to venous thrombosis in the horizontal PAP flap group (NS). Three patients (14%) experienced delayed healing at thedonor site compared with four patients (10%) in the horizontal PAP flap group(NS).CONCLUSION:  The fleur-de-lys skin paddle design not only allows an increase ofthe horizontal PAP flap volume, but also increases the skin surface, with anacceptable donor site morbidity. For medium- or large-sized breasts, thefleur-de-lys PAP flap seems to be ideal when a DIEP flap-based reconstruction is contraindicated.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.DOI: 10.1055/s-0038-1649508 PMID: 29859510
