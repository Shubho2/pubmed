Besides inhibiting aromatase activity, EXE has multiple biologicalfunctions, such as antiproliferation, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidantactivities which are all involved in hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, we investigatedthe role of EXE during the progress of hepatic fibrosis. The effect of EXE onliver injury and fibrosis were assessed in two hepatic fibrosis rat models, whichwere induced by either carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or bile duct ligation (BDL).The influence of EXE treatment on activation and proliferation of primary rathepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was observed in vitro. The results showed that EXE attenuated the liver fibrosis by decreasing the collagen deposition and Î±-SMAexpression in vivo and inhibited the activation and proliferation of primary rat HSCs in vitro. Additionally, EXE promoted the secretion of antifibrotic andanti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in vivo and in HSC-T6 culture media. Inconclusion, our findings reveal a new function of EXE on hepatic fibrosis andprompted its latent application in liver fibrotic-related disease.DOI: 10.1155/2017/3072745 PMCID: PMC5804406PMID: 29464186
