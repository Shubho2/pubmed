Apparent benefits to patients with screen-detected cancersmay be due to selection bias from exclusion of interval cancers (ICs). Treatment intensity is rarely discussed, with an assumption that all ESBCs are treatedsimilarly. We hypothesized that women diagnosed while in a screening programwould receive less-intense treatment than those never or not recently screened(NRS).METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all women aged 50-69 years managed for ESBC (invasive or DCIS) during the period 2007-2013 within a single service, comparing treatment according to screening status. Data on demographics,detection, pathology, and treatment were derived from hospital, cancer registry, and screening service records.RESULTS: Overall, 622 patients were active screeners (AS) at diagnosis (569screen-detected and 53 ICs) and 169 patients were NRS. AS cancers were smaller(17 mm vs. 26 mm, p < 0.0001), less likely to involve nodes (26% vs. 48%,p < 0.0001), and lower grade. For invasive cancer, NRS patients were more likely to be recommended for mastectomies [35% vs. 16%; risk ratio(RR) 2.2, p < 0.0001],axillary dissection (43% vs. 19%; RR 2.3, p < 0.0001), adjuvant chemotherapy (65%vs. 37%; RR 1.7, p < 0.0001), and postmastectomy radiotherapy (58% vs. 39%; RR1.5, p = 0.04).CONCLUSION: Participants in population screening diagnosed with ESBC receivesubstantially less-intense treatment than non-participants. Differences persistwhen potential overdiagnosis is taken into account; these differences should befactored into debates around mammographic screening.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6469-7 PMID: 29717421
