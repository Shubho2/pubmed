We aimed toidentify the key miRNAs protecting DCIS from malignant evolution, that mayconstitute markers for non-invasive lesions. We studied 100 archived DCISsamples, including pure DCIS, DCIS with adjacent IDC and pure DCIS from patients with subsequent IDC in contralateral breast or no recurrence. A DCIS derived cellline was used for molecular and cellular studies. A genome wide study revealedthat pure DCIS has higher miR-126 and miR-218 expression than DCIS with adjacent IDC lesions or than IDC. The down-regulation of miR-126 and miR-218 promotedinvasiveness in vitro and, in patients with pure DCIS, was associated with later onset of IDC. Survival studies of independent cohorts indicated that both miRNAs play a protective role in IDC. The clinical findings are in agreement with themiRNAs' roles in cell adhesion, differentiation and proliferation. We proposethat miR-126 and miR-218 have a protective role in DCIS and represent novelbiomarkers for the risk assessment in women with early detection of breastcancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25261 PMCID: PMC5955110PMID: 29805754
