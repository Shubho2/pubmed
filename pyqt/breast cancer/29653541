TARGIT-A comparedrisk-adapted single-dose intra-operative radiotherapy (TARGIT-IORT) to wholebreast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).METHODS: Patients, their Radiation Oncologist and Research Nurse completed asubjective cosmetic assessment questionnaire before radiotherapy and annuallythereafter for five years. Objective data previously calculated by the validated BCCT.core software which utilizes digital photographs to score symmetry, colourand scar was also used. Agreement was assessed by the Kappa statistic andlongitudinal changes were assessed by generalized estimating equations.RESULTS: Overall, an Excellent-Good (EG) cosmetic result was scored more oftenthan a Fair-Poor (FP) result for both treatment groups across all time points,with patients who received TARGIT-IORT scoring EG more often than those whoreceived EBRT however this was statistically significant at Year 5 only. Therewas modest agreement between the four rating systems with the highest Kappa scorebeing moderate agreement which was between nurse and doctor scores at Year 1 withKappa = 0.46 (p < 0.001), 95% CI (0.24, 0.68).CONCLUSION: Despite similar overall findings between treatment groups and rating systems, the inter-rater agreement was only modest. This suggests that the fourrating systems utilized may not necessarily be used interchangeably and it isarguable that for an outcome such as cosmetic appearance, the patient's point of view is the most important.TRIAL REGISTRATION: TARGIT-A ISRCTN34086741 , Registered 21 July 2004,retrospectively registered.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-0998-x PMCID: PMC5899392PMID: 29653541
