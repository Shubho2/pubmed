The features were identifiedbased on a review of the existing literature with consideration of their usage,prognostic ability, and uniqueness. The set was then extended so that itcomprehensively describes breast cancer imaging characteristics. The featureswere classified into 10 groups based on the type of data used to extract them andthe type of calculation being performed. For the assessment of inter-readervariability, four fellowship-trained readers annotated tumors on preoperativedynamic contrast-enhanced MRIs for 50 breast cancer patients. Based on theannotations, an algorithm automatically segmented the image and extracted allfeatures resulting in one set of features for each reader. For a given feature,the inter-reader stability was defined as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) computed using the feature values obtained through all readers for allcases.RESULTS: The average inter-reader stability for all features was 0.8474 (95% CI: 0.8068-0.8858). The mean inter-reader stability was lower for tumor-basedfeatures (0.6348, 95% CI: 0.5391-0.7257) than FGT-based features (0.9984, 95% CI:0.9970-0.9992). The feature group with the highest inter-reader stabilityquantifies breast and FGT volume. The feature group with the lowest inter-reader stability quantifies variations in tumor enhancement.CONCLUSIONS: Breast MRI radiomics features widely vary in terms of theirstability in the presence of inter-reader variability. Appropriate measures need to be taken for reducing this variability in tumor-based radiomics.© 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/mp.12925 PMID: 29663411
