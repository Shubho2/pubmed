Oskar.Karlsson@farmbio.uu.se.Despite significant advances in early detection and treatment, breast cancerremains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)is a suspected endocrine disruptor and a common environmental pollutantassociated with various diseases including cancer. However, the effects of PFOAand its mechanisms of action on hormone-responsive cells remain unclear. Here, weexplored the potential tumorigenic activity of PFOA (100 nM-1 mM) in human breastepithelial cells (MCF-10A). MCF-10A cells exposed to 50 and 100 µM PFOAdemonstrated a higher growth rate compared to controls. The compound promotedMCF-10A proliferation by accelerating G0/G1 to S phase transition of the cellcycle. PFOA increased cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 levels, concomitant with a decrease inp27. In contrast to previous studies of perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS), theestrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 had no effect on PFOA-induced cellproliferation, whereas the PPARα antagonist GW 6471 was able to prevent theMCF-10A proliferation, indicating that the underlying mechanisms involvePPARα-dependent pathways. Interestingly, we also showed that PFOA is able tostimulate cell migration and invasion, demonstrating its potential to induceneoplastic transformation of human breast epithelial cells. These results suggestthat more attention should be paid to the roles of PFOA in the development andprogression of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s00204-018-2181-4 PMCID: PMC5962621PMID: 29502166
