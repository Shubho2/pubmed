Study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2. Meta-analysis of CDR andrecall rate used a random effects model. Summary ROC curve summarized sensitivityand specificity.RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included (five diagnostic; eleven screening). Indiagnosis, DBT increased sensitivity (84%-90%) versus DM alone (69%-86%) but not specificity. DBT improved CDR versus DM alone (RR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.31). Inscreening, DBT + DM increased CDR versus DM alone (RR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.20-1.47 forretrospective studies; RR: 1.52, 95% CI 1.08-2.11 for prospective studies).Recall rate was significantly reduced by DBT + DM in retrospective studies (RR:0.72, 95% CI 0.64-0.80) but not in two prospective studies (RR: 1.12, 95% CI0.76-1.63).CONCLUSION: In women with mammographically dense breasts, DBT+/-DM increased CDR significantly (versus DM) in screening and diagnosis. In diagnosis, DBT+/-DMincreased sensitivity but not specificity. The effect of DBT + DM on recall rate in screening dense breasts varied between studies.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4263-3 PMCID: PMC5883365PMID: 29615072
