Evidence of the impact of food groups andnutrients on the risk of breast and lung cancer is limited and lackingconclusions. Studies on food consumption and breast or lung cancer are limited.OBJECTIVES: Assessment of the association between dietary patterns and theprevalence of breast and lung cancers in adult Poles.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved a pooled analysis of 2 case-controlstudies on 320 subjects aged 50-70 years from north-eastern Poland (160 women,160 men). Breast cancer cases in 80 women and lung cancer cases in 80 men werediagnosed. The food consumption frequency for 21 selected foods was collectedusing the Questionnaire of Eating Behaviors (QEB). Principal component analysisand multiple logistic regression analysis were used. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated.RESULTS: Three dietary patterns (DPs) were identified: 'Prudent', 'Processed &fast food', and 'Traditional Polish'. In the pooled analysis for both cancers,the ORs were from 0.35 (95% CI: 0.20-0.61; p < 0.05 with adjustment for age) to0.48 (95% CI: 0.26-0.88; p < 0.05 with adjustment for age, socioeconomic statusindex, physical activity, smoking, and abuse of alcohol) in the upper tertile of the 'Prudent' DP in comparison to the absence of cancers (OR = 1.00). The ORs of both cancers were 1.83 (95% CI: 1.06-3.16; p < 0.05 with adjustment for age) inthe upper tertile of the 'Processed & fast food' DP. The ORs of both cancers for the 'Traditional Polish' DP were insignificant.CONCLUSIONS: In the pooled analysis, a strong inverse relation was found between the 'Prudent' dietary pattern, characterized by higher frequency of dairy, fruit,vegetables, wholemeal bread, fish and juices consumption, and breast or lungcancer prevalence, irrespective of age, socioeconomic status, physical activity, smoking, alcohol abuse, and type of cancer in Polish adults from north-easternPoland.PMID: 29442457  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
