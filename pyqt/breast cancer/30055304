Electronic address: sherafatian@modares.ac.ir.Breast cancer is a complex disease and its effective treatment needs affordablediagnosis and subtyping signatures. While the use of machine learning approach inclinical computation biology is still in its infancy, the prevalent approach inidentifying molecular biomarkers remains to be screening of all biomarkers bydifferential expression analysis. Many of these attempts used miRNAs expressiondata in breast cancer and amounted to the multitude of differentially expressedmiRNAs in this cancer; hence, the minimal set of miRNA biomarkers to classifybreast cancer is yet to be identified. Availability of diverse and vast amount ofcancer datasets like The Cancer Genome Atlas facilitated the molecular profiling of patients' tumors and introduced new challenges like clinical gradeinterpretations from big data. In this study, miRNA expression dataset of breast cancer patients from TCGA database was used to develop prediction models fromwhich miRNA biomarkers were identified for diagnosis and molecular subtyping ofthis cancer. I took the advantage of interpretability of tree-basedclassification models to extract their rules and identify minimal set ofbiomarkers in this cancer. Empirical negative control miRNAs in breast cancerobtained and used to normalize the dataset. Tree-based machine learning modelstrained in my analysis used hsa-miR-139 with hsa-miR-183 to classify breasttumors from normal samples, and hsa-miR4728 with hsa-miR190b to further classify these tumors into three major subtypes of breast cancer. In addition to theproposed biomarkers, the most important miRNAs in breast cancer classificationwere also presented.Copyright Â© 2018.
