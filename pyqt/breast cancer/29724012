We havealso demonstrated that Frondoside A is able to potentiate and/or synergize theanti-cancer effects of major classical cytotoxic agents, namely, gemcitabine,paclitaxel, and cisplatin, in the treatment of pancreatic, breast, and lungcancer, respectively. This study evaluates the impact of Frondoside A alone andin combination with the standard cytotoxic drugs oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) in the treatment of colon cancer using three human colon cancer celllines, namely, HT-29, HCT-116, and HCT8/S11. We demonstrate that Frondoside A,oxaliplatin, and 5-FU cause a concentration- and time-dependent reduction in the number of HT-29 colon cancer cells. A concentration of 2.5 &micro;M of FrondosideA led to almost 100% inhibition of cell numbers at 72 h. A similar effect wasonly observed with a much higher concentration (100 &micro;M) of oxaliplatin or5-FU. The reduction in cell numbers by Frondoside A, oxaliplatin, and 5-FU wasalso confirmed in two other colon cancer cell lines, namely, HCT8/S11 andHCT-116, treated for 48 h. The combinations of low concentrations of these drugs for 48 h in vitro clearly demonstrated that Frondoside A enhances the inhibition of cell numbers induced by oxaliplatin or 5-FU. Similarly, such a combinationalso efficiently inhibited colony growth in vitro. Interestingly, we found thatthe inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was significantly enhanced whenFrondoside A was used in combination treatments. Moreover, we show thatFrondoside A and 5-FU, when used alone, induce a concentration-dependentinduction of apoptosis and that their pro-apoptotic effect is dramaticallyenhanced when used in combination. We further demonstrate that apoptosisinduction upon the treatment of colon cancer cells was at least in part a result of the inhibition of phosphorylation of the survival kinase AKT, leading tocaspase-3 activation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inactivation, andconsequently DNA damage, as suggested by the increase in the level of&gamma;H2AX. In light of these findings, we strongly suggest that Frondoside Amay have a role in colon cancer therapy when used in combination with thestandard cytotoxic drugs oxaliplatin and 5-FU.DOI: 10.3390/nu10050560 PMCID: PMC5986440PMID: 29724012
