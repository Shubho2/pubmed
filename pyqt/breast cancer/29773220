Although the majority are definitively diagnosed as normal, benign, or malignant, approximately 7% are categorised as B3, ofuncertain malignant potential. These include a wide range of lesions withdifferent risks of associated malignancy from <2% to approaching 40% fromliterature review in UK practice. Historically, these have typically beensurgically excised as a diagnostic procedure but the majority are then proven to be benign. An alternative approach, for many of these lesions, is thoroughsampling/excision by vacuum-assisted biopsy techniques to exclude the presence ofco-existing carcinoma. This would potentially reduce the benign open biopsy rate whilst maintaining accuracy of cancer diagnosis. A group from the Radiology,Surgery, and Pathology NHS Breast Screening Programme Co-ordinating Committeesand an additional co-opted expert were charged with review and development ofguidelines for the clinical management of B3 lesions. The guidelines reflectsuggested practice as stated by the NHS Breast Screening Programme and approvedby the Royal College of Radiologists.Copyright Â© 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
