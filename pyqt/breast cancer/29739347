Its expression in tumor tissue has been linked to poor clinical outcome. This study was designed toevaluate the clinical relevance of RAS p21 levels in peripheral blood in a large cohort of metastatic breast cancer patients.METHODS: Two hundred fifty-one patients with metastatic breast cancer wereenrolled in this prospective, multicentre, open-label, non-randomized study.Blood samples were collected before start of first-line or later-line treatment. RAS p21 was determined using a sandwich-type ELISA immunoassay. For thedetermination of the cutoff, blood samples from age-matched healthy controls wereanalyzed. A value above 452 pg/ml was regarded as elevated (mean + 2 x SD). Inthe univariate survival analysis, two other cutoffs were considered as well (50thand 75th percentile of patients, i.e. 229 pg/ml and 320 pg/ml). Circulating tumorcells (CTCs) were detected using the CellSearch system.RESULTS: 29 of 251 (12%) patients had RAS p21 levels above the cut-off level of452 pg/ml. Clinical-pathological parameters, such as hormone receptor and HER2status, line of therapy and CTC status, did not correlate with RAS p21 levels.Elevated RAS p21 was significantly associated with shorter progression-free andoverall survival in the univariate analysis (median PFS: 3.9 months [95%-CI:1.8-6.0] for patients with elevated RAS p21 levels versus 8.5 months [95%-CI:7.4-9.5] with non-elevated levels [p = 0.01]; median OS: 7.1 months [95%-CI:0.3-14.2] versus not reached [p = 0.002], respectively). When RAS p21 cutoffsother than 452 pg/ml were considered, elevated RAS p21 was significantlyassociated with OS but not with PFS. Classical clinical-pathological factors wereincluded into a multivariate Cox regression analysis. In addition, factorspreviously shown to influence survival in a univariate analysis, such as serumHER2, CAIX and TIMP1, were included as well. In the multivariate analysis, RASp21, presence of ≥5 CTCs per 7.5 ml blood, higher grading and higher line oftherapy remained independent predictors of shorter OS.CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic breast cancer patients with elevated levels ofcirculating RAS p21 have significantly worse clinical outcome. Hypothetically,these patients might benefit from therapeutic strategies targeting RAS pathway.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN59722891 (DETECT); trialregistration date: April, 17th 2010; the trial was registered retrospectively.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4282-0 PMCID: PMC5941516PMID: 29739347
