[Epub ahead ofprint]Beyond the Cell Cycle: Enhancing the Immune Surveillance of Tumors Via CDK4/6Inhibition.Chaikovsky AC(1)(2), Sage J(3)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford,California.(2)Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford,California.(3)Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford,California. julsage@stanford.edu.Inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) were originallydesigned to block proliferation and cell cycle progression of cancer cells inwhich the activity of these kinases is dysregulated. CDK4/6 inhibitors havealready been FDA approved for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positivebreast cancer and are being tested in numerous other cancer types. However,several recent studies have identified novel effects of CDK4/6 inhibitors ontumor growth, most notably an indirect effect resulting from the activation ofimmune surveillance. This Perspective discusses these recent observations,including the effects that CDK4/6 inhibitors may have on immune cells themselves.It is likely that CDK4/6 inhibitors will have a broader impact than theirexpected induction of cell cycle arrest in the treatment of human cancers.
