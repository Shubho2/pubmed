University of California, Irvine, California, USA.BACKGROUND: Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) on dynamic contrast-enhanced(DCE)-MRI has been associated with breast cancer risk, both based on qualitative and quantitative assessments.PURPOSE: To investigate whether BPE of the contralateral breast on preoperativeDCE-MRI is associated with therapy outcome in ER-positive, HER2-negative,node-negative invasive breast cancer.STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.POPULATION: In all, 289 patients with unilateral ER-positive, HER2-negative,node-negative breast cancer larger than 5 mm.FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T, T1 -weighted DCE sequence.ASSESSMENT: BPE of the contralateral breast was assessed qualitatively by twodedicated radiologists and quantitatively (using region-of-interest and automaticbreast segmentation).STATISTICAL TESTS: Cox regression analysis was used to determine associationswith recurrence-free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DFS).Interobserver variability for parenchymal enhancement was assessed using kappastatistics and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 75.8 months. Multivariate analysis showed receipt of total mastectomy (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.497) and high Ki-67 expression level (HR: 5.956) were independent factors associated with worse RFS (P < 0.05). Only a high Ki-67 expression level was associated with worse DFS (HR: 3.571,P = 0.045). BPE assessments were not associated with outcome (RFS [qualitativeBPE: P = 0.75, 0.92 for readers 1 and 2; quantitative BPE: P = 0.38-0.99], DFS,[qualitative BPE: P = 0.41, 0.16 for readers 1 and 2; quantitative BPE:P = 0.68-0.99]). For interobserver variability, there was good agreement between qualitative (κ = 0.700) and good to perfect agreement for most quantitativeparameters of BPE.DATA CONCLUSION: Contralateral BPE showed no association with survival outcome inpatients with ER-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative invasive breast cancer. Ahigh Ki-67 expression level was associated with both worse recurrence-free anddistant metastasis-free survival.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 4 J. Magn. Reson.
