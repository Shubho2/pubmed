China.Long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma‑associated 1 (UCA1) has beenused in tumor development and progression in many types of cancer. However, thefunction and mechanism underlying the action of UCA1 in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) remains unclear. Therefore, these topics were investigated in the presentstudy by in vitro and in vivo experiments. It was demonstrated that theexpression level of UCA1 was more significantly upregulated in PTC cell lines andtissues when compared with the immortal human thyroid follicular cell line andadjacent normal tissues, respectively. UCA1 knockdown significantly inhibited PTCcell viability, colony formation and the bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4)expression level in vitro, and retarded PTC tumor growth in vivo. In the previousstudy, microRNA (miR)‑204 inhibited thyroid cancer progression and was regulated by UCA1 in other types of cancer. In addition, by conducting dual luciferasereporter assays, it was confirmed that miR‑204 directly binds to UCA1 and the3'‑untranslated region of BRD4. Furthermore, UCA1 competed with BRD4 for miR‑204 binding. miR‑204 knockdown enhanced BRD4 expression, which can be partiallyrestored by short hairpin‑UCA1. The results of the present study illustrated thatUCA1 promotes PTC progression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA by spongingmiR‑204. In conclusion, UCA1 may be regarded as an oncogenic lncRNA, promotingPTC cell proliferation, and be a potential target for human PTC treatment.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9246 PMID: 30015945
