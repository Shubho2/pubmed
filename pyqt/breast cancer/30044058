[Epub ahead of print]Radiation-associated sarcoma after breast cancer in a nationwide population:Increasing risk of angiosarcoma.Salminen SH(1), Sampo MM(2), Böhling TO(2), Tuomikoski L(1), Tarkkanen M(1),Blomqvist CP(1)(3).Author information: (1)Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) and Universityof Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.(2)Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki and HUSLAB Helsinki UniversityHospital, Helsinki, Finland.(3)Department of Oncology, Örebro University Hospital, Örebro, Sweden.Radiation-associated sarcoma (RAS) is a rare complication of radiation therapy(RT) to breast cancer (BC). This study explored RAS after RT to BC in anationwide population-based material. The Finnish Cancer Registry was queried forpatients with BC treated during 1953-2014 who were later diagnosed with asecondary sarcoma in 1953-2014. Registry data, patient files, and sarcomaspecimens were  analyzed to confirm diagnosis and location of RAS at or close to the RT target volume. A total of 132 512 patients were diagnosed with invasive BCduring the study period. A subsequent sarcoma was diagnosed in 355 patients.After exclusion, 96 RAS were identified. Angiosarcoma (AS) was the most prevalenthistology in 50 (52%) of 96 patients. However, the first radiation-associated AS was diagnosed in a patient treated for BC with breast-conserving surgery in 1984,and thereafter, the proportion of AS continuously increased. The 5-yearsarcoma-specific survival was 75.1% for RAS treated with a curative intent. Thedistribution of histologic subtypes of RAS has changed during the 60 years ofthis registry study. The first radiation-associated AS was diagnosed in 1989, andpresently, AS is the most common histologic subtype of RAS. It is possible thatchanges in BC treatment strategies are influencing the characteristics of RAS.© 2018 The Authors.
