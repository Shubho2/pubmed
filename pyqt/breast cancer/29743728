[Epub ahead of print]Spatially correlated phenotyping reveals K5-positive luminal progenitor cells andp63-K5/14-positive stem cell-like cells in human breast epithelium.Boecker W(1)(2), van Horn L(3), Stenman G(4), Stürken C(5), Schumacher U(5),Loening T(6), Liesenfeld L(3), Korsching E(7), Gläser D(8), Tiemann K(3),Buchwalow I(9).Author information: (1)Gerhard-Domagk-Institute of Pathology, University of Muenster, Münster,Germany. boecker@me.com.(2)Gerhard-Seifert Reference Center Breast, Oral- and Gynecopathology-Hanspath,Hamburg, Germany. boecker@me.com.(3)Institute for Hematopathology, Hamburg, Germany.(4)Department of Pathology and Genetics, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University ofGothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.(5)Institute of Anatomy and Experimental Morphology, University Cancer Center,University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.(6)Gerhard-Seifert Reference Center Breast, Oral- and Gynecopathology-Hanspath,Hamburg, Germany.(7)Institute of Bioinformatic, University of Münster, Münster, Germany.(8)Institute of Pathology, Dietrich-Bonhoeffer Clinic, Neubrandenburg, Germany.(9)Institute for Hematopathology, Hamburg, Germany. buchwalow@pathologie-hh.de.Understanding the mechanisms regulating human mammary epithelium requiresknowledge of the cellular constituents of this tissue. Different and partiallycontradictory definitions and concepts describing the cellular hierarchy ofmammary epithelium have been proposed, including our studies of keratins K5and/or K14 as markers of progenitor cells. Furthermore, we and others havesuggested that the p53 homolog p63 is a marker of human breast epithelial stemcells. In this investigation, we expand our previous studies by testing whetherimmunohistochemical staining with monospecific anti-keratin antibodies incombination with an antibody against the stem cell marker p63 might help refinethe different morphologic phenotypes in normal breast epithelium. We used in situmultilabel staining for p63, different keratins, the myoepithelial marker smooth muscle actin (SMA), the estrogen receptor (ER), and Ki67 to dissect and quantify the cellular components of 16 normal pre- and postmenopausal human breastepithelial tissue samples at the single-cell level. Importantly, we confirm theexistence of K5+ only cells and suggest that they, in contrast to the currentview, are key luminal precursor cells from which K8/18+ progeny cells evolve.These cells are further modified by the expression of ER and Ki67. We have alsoidentified a population of p63+K5+ cells that are only found in nipple ducts.Based on our findings, we propose a new concept of the cellular hierarchy ofhuman breast epithelium, including K5 luminal lineage progenitors throughout the ductal-lobular axis and p63+K5+ progenitors confined to the nipple ducts.DOI: 10.1038/s41374-018-0054-3 PMID: 29743728
