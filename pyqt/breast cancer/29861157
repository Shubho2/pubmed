Aberrantexpression of satellite RNAs in cultured cells induces the DNA damage response,activates cell cycle checkpoints, and causes defects in chromosome segregation.However, the mechanism by which satellite RNA expression leads to genomicinstability is not well understood. Here we provide evidence that increasedlevels of satellite RNAs in mammary glands induce tumor formation in mice. Using mass spectrometry, we further show that genomic instability induced by satellite RNAs occurs through interactions with BRCA1-associated protein networks required for the stabilization of DNA replication forks. Additionally, de-stabilizedreplication forks likely promote the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids in cellsexpressing satellite RNAs. These studies lay the foundation for developing novel therapeutic strategies that block the effects of non-coding satellite RNAs incancer cells.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
