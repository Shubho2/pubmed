However, repeated SN scintigraphy in ipsilateral breasttumor relapse (IBTR) often shows extra-axillary drainage, including contralateralaxilla. A patient diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer, of which one was IBTR, was studied by sequential radio-guided SN mapping, radiocolloid injection to anIBTR breast and scanning, and then radiocolloid injection to the other breast andscanning. This revealed the lymphatic flow from the IBTR breast to thecontralateral axilla. Sequential method may help to depict contralateral axillarylymphatic flow from an IBTR breast in patients with bilateral breast cancer.DOI: 10.1097/RLU.0000000000002104 PMID: 29659396
