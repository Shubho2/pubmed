Wetherefore set out to directly examine the effect of glycolysis on SCLC cellphenotype, using a model where glycolysis is stably reduced by adapting the cellsto a sugar source other than glucose. Restricting glycolysis using this approach consistently resulted in cells with increased oncogenic potential; including anincrease in SCLC cells, proliferation in 3D matrigel, invasiveness,chemoresistance, and altered global gene expression. Tumorigenicity in vivo wasalso markedly increased. SCLC cells exhibited increased dependence upon alternatemetabolic pathways. They also became c-KIT dependent, indicating that theirapparent state of maturation is regulated by glycolysis. Single-cell mRNAsequencing identified altered networks of metabolic-, stem- and signaling- geneexpression within SCLC-enriched populations in response to glycolyticrestriction. Therefore, reduced glycolysis, which may occur in niches withintumors where glucose availability is limiting, can promote tumor aggressivenessby increasing SCLC cell populations, but can also introduce novel, potentiallyexploitable, vulnerabilities in SCLC cells.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25299 PMCID: PMC5955399PMID: 29796188
