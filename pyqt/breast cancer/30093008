Near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores have a great potential for such an application. To overcome NIR dyes short blood circulationtime and increase tumor accumulation, a NIR dye, cypate, was associated witholeyl hyaluronan, which can self-assemble into polymeric aggregates. The cypateassociation with oleyl hyaluronan was performed either by a covalent linkage, or physical entrapment. The two systems were compared for tumor targeting andcontrast enhancement using BALB/c mice bearing 4T1 breast cancer tumors.Independently on the way of cypate association, it took more than 24 h fromintravenous administration to detect NIR signal in tumors and the tumors wereclearly visualized for 2 following weeks without substrate reinjection.Covalently linked cypate generated 2-3 fold stronger fluorescence signal thanphysically loaded cypate. This study demonstrates the potential of HA matrix tobe used as carrier of contrast agents for non-invasive long-term tumorvisualization.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
