[Epub ahead of print]Cancer-specific SNPs originate from low-level heteroplasmic variants in humanmitochondrial genomes of a matched cell line pair.Hedberg A(1), Knutsen E(1), Løvhaugen AS(1), Jørgensen TE(2), Perander M(1),Johansen SD(1)(2).Author information: (1)a Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences , UiT - The ArcticUniversity of Norway , Tromsø , Norway.(2)b Genomics Group, Faculty of Biosciences and Aquaculture , Nord University ,Bodø , Norway.Low-level mitochondrial heteroplasmy is a common phenomenon in both normal andcancer cells. Here, we investigate the link between low-level heteroplasmy andmitogenome mutations in a human breast cancer matched cell line byhigh-throughput sequencing. We identified 23 heteroplasmic sites, of which 15were common between normal cells (Hs578Bst) and cancer cells (Hs578T). Most siteswere clustered within the highly conserved Complex IV and ribosomal RNA genes.Two heteroplasmic variants in normal cells were found as fixed mutations incancer cells. This indicates a positive selection of these variants in cancercells. RNA-Seq analysis identified upregulated L-strand specific transcripts incancer cells, which include three mitochondrial long non-coding RNA molecules. Wehypothesize that this is due to two cancer cell-specific mutations in the controlregion.DOI: 10.1080/24701394.2018.1461852 PMID: 29671673
