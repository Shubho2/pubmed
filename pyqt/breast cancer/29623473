Therefore, Cu(SBCM)2 has great potential to be developed as anagent for the management of breast cancer. The present study was carried out toinvestigate the mode of cell death induced by Cu(SBCM)2 towards MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells. The inhibitory and morphological changes of MDA-MB-231 cellstreated with Cu(SBCM)2 was determined by using MTT assay and inverted lightmicroscope, respectively. The safety profile of Cu(SBCM)2 was also evaluatedtowards human dermal fibroblast (HDF) normal cells. Confirmation of apoptosis andcell cycle arrest were determined by flow cytometry analysis. The expression ofp53, Bax, Bcl-2 and MMP2 protein were detected with western blot analysis.Cu(SBCM)2 significantly inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in adose-dependent manner with GI50 18.7 ± 3.06 µM. Indeed, Cu(SBCM)2 was less toxic towards HDF normal cells with GI50 31.8 ± 4.0 µM. Morphological study revealedthat Cu(SBCM)2-treated MDA-MB-231 cells experienced cellular shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation and formation of apoptotic bodies, suggestingthat Cu(SBCM)2 induced apoptosis in the cells, which was confirmed byAnnexin-V/PI flow cytometry analysis. It was also found that Cu(SBCM)2 inducedG2/M phase cell cycle arrest towards MDA-MB-231 cells. The induction of apoptosisand cell cycle arrest in the present study is possibly due to the down-regulationof the mutant p53 and MMP2 protein. In conclusion, Cu(SBCM)2 can be developed as a targeted therapy for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10534-018-0096-4 PMID: 29623473
