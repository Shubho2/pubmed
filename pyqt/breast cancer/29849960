Despite several major treatment breakthroughs,standard treatment using surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy has failed toimprove overall survival. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore newstrategies and innovative therapies to further improve the survival rates ofpatients with sarcomas. Pathological angiogenesis has an important role in thegrowth and metastasis of tumors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) andvascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) play a central role intumor angiogenesis and represent potential targets for anticancer therapy. As anovel targeted therapy, especially with regard to angiogenesis, apatinib is a newtype of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively targets VEGFR-2and has shown encouraging anticancer activity in a wide range of malignancies,including gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer,hepatocellular carcinoma, and sarcomas. In this review, we summarize thepreclinical and clinical data for apatinib, focusing primarily on its use in the treatment of sarcomas.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24647 PMCID: PMC5966248PMID: 29849960
