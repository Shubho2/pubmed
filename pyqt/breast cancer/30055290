Electronic address: katja.pokrovskaja@ki.se.Resistance to chemotherapy is a challenging problem for treatment of cancerpatients and autophagy has been shown to mediate development of resistance. Inthis study we systematically screened a library of 306 known anti-cancer drugsfor their ability to induce autophagy using a cell-based assay. 114 of the drugs were classified as autophagy inducers; for 16 drugs, the cytotoxicity waspotentiated by siRNA-mediated knock-down of Atg7 and Vps34. These drugs werefurther evaluated in breast cancer cell lines for autophagy induction, and twotyrosine kinase inhibitors, Sunitinib and Erlotinib, were selected for furtherstudies. For the pharmacological inhibition of autophagy, we have characterizedhere a novel highly potent selective inhibitor of Vps34, SB02024. SB02024 blockedautophagy in vitro and reduced xenograft growth of two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, in vivo. Vps34 inhibitor significantly potentiatedcytotoxicity of Sunitinib and Erlotinib in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 in vitro inmonolayer cultures and when grown as multicellular spheroids. Our data suggeststhat inhibition of autophagy significantly improves sensitivity to Sunitinib and Erlotinib and that Vps34 is a promising therapeutic target for combinationstrategies in breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).
