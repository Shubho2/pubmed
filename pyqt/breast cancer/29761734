DeGroote Institute for Pain Research and Care, McMasterUniversity, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.(2)2 Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University,Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Breast cancer cells release the signalling molecule glutamate via the system xC- antiporter, which is upregulated to exchange extracellular cystine forintracellular glutamate to protect against oxidative stress. Here, we demonstratethat this antiporter is functionally influenced by the actions of theneurotrophin nerve growth factor on its cognate receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkA,and that inhibiting this complex may reduce cancer-induced bone pain via itsdownstream actions on xCT, the functional subunit of system xC-. We havecharacterized the effects of the selective TrkA inhibitor AG879 on system xC-activity in murine 4T1 and human MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma cells, as well asits effects on nociception in our validated immunocompetent mouse model ofcancer-induced bone pain, in which BALB/c mice are intrafemorally inoculated with4T1 murine carcinoma cells. AG879 decreased functional system xC- activity, asmeasured by cystine uptake and glutamate release, and inhibited nociceptive andphysiologically relevant responses in tumour-bearing animals. Cumulatively, thesedata suggest that the activation of TrkA by nerve growth factor may havefunctional implications on system xC--mediated cancer pain. System xC--mediatedTrkA activation therefore presents a promising target for therapeuticintervention in cancer pain treatment.DOI: 10.1177/1744806918776467 PMCID: PMC5956640PMID: 29761734
