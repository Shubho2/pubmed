Thepresent study evaluated the anti-tumor capacity of mulberry anthocyanins (MA) in thyroid cancer cells. Our data showed that MA suppressed SW1736 and HTh-7 cellproliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, flow cytometryresults indicated that MA significantly increased SW1736 and HTh-7 cellapoptosis. We additionally observed that SW1736 and HTh-7 cell autophagy wasmarkedly enhanced after MA treatment. Importantly, anthocyanin-induced cell deathwas largely abolished by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or chloroquine diphosphate salt(CQ) treatment, suggesting that MA-induced SW1736 and HTh-7 cell death waspartially dependent on autophagy. In addition, activation of protein kinase B(Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and ribosomal protein S6 (S6) weresignificantly suppressed by anthocyanin exposure. In summary, MA may serve as an adjunctive therapy for thyroid cancer patients through induction of apoptosis andautophagy-dependent cell death.Copyright Â© 2017.
