Quality of breast,colorectal, lung, head & neck, and gastric cancer care was reviewed with respect to NCCN guidelines. Direct medical costs and shortage of budget in reimbursedamounts were calculated for each listed chemotherapy regimen.RESULTS: Medical oncology practice following the schemes' formularies is inferiorto recommendations by the NCCN guidelines. Innovative treatment (targetedtherapies) like trastuzumab, pertuzumab (breast), bevacizumab, cetuximab,panitumumab (colorectal), erlotinib, gefitinib, crizotinib, and nivolumab (lung) are either not reimbursed (VAS, CMCHS) or partially reimbursed (RAS). Averageshortage of budget was found to be 43% (breast), 55% (colorectal), 74% (lung), 7%(head & neck), and 51% (gastric cancer).CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers should consider addition of newer treatments,exclusion of sub-optimal treatments, increments in per patient budget andoptimization of supportive care, which may contribute to improvements in survivaland quality of life for Indian cancer patients.DOI: 10.1080/14737167.2018.1444479 PMID: 29466887  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
