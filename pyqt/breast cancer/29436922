Shared environment in families as wellas epigenetic changes that also may be influenced by shared genetics andenvironment may also explain familial clustering of cancers. Epigeneticregulation, such as DNA methylation, can change the activity of a DNA segmentwithout a change in the sequence; environmental exposures experienced across the life course can induce such changes. However, genetic-epigenetic interactions,detected as methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs; a.k.a. meQTLs) andhaplotype-dependent allele-specific methylation (hap-ASM), can also contribute tointer-individual differences in DNA methylation patterns. To identifydifferentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with breast cancersusceptibility, we examined differences in white blood cell DNA methylation in 29candidate genes in 426 girls (ages 6-13 years) from the LEGACY Girls Study, 239with and 187 without a breast cancer family history (BCFH). We measuredmethylation by targeted massively parallel bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq) andobserved BCFH DMRs in two genes: ESR1 (Δ4.9%, P = 0.003) and SEC16B (Δ3.6%, P =0.026), each of which has been previously implicated in breast cancersusceptibility and pubertal development. These DMRs showed high inter-individual variability in methylation, suggesting the presence of mQTLs/hap-ASM. Usingsingle nucleotide polymorphisms data in the bis-seq amplicon, we found stronghap-ASM in SEC16B (with allele specific-differences ranging from 42% to 74%).These findings suggest that differential methylation in genes relevant to breast cancer susceptibility may be present early in life, and that inherited geneticfactors underlie some of these epigenetic differences.DOI: 10.1080/15592294.2018.1435243 PMCID: PMC5997170 [Available on 2019-04-02]PMID: 29436922
