We therefore aimed to elucidate the expression andfunction of PITX2 during the pathogenesis of endocrine resistance in BCa.Materials and methods: PITX2 expression was assessed in BCa tissues usingquantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry and in experimentallyinduced letrozole-resistant BCa cells using RT-qPCR and immunoblotting. Effectsof PITX2 deregulation on BCa progression was determined by assessing MTT,apoptosis and xenograft model. Finally, using multiple assays, thetranscriptional regulation of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 1(IFITM1) by PITX2 was studied at both molecular and functional levels.Results: PITX2 expression was induced in letrozole-resistant BCa tissues andcells, and PITX2 induction by IFNα signaling powerfully protected BCa cellsagainst letrozole insult and potentiated letrozole-resistance. Mechanistically,PITX2 enhanced IFNα-induced AKT activation by transactivating the transcriptionof IFITM1, thus rendering BCa cells unresponsive to letrozole-elicited celldeath. Additionally, ablation of IFITM1 expression using siRNA substantiallyabolished IFNα-elicited AKT phosphorylation, even in the presence of PITX2overexpression, thus sensitizing BCa cells to letrozole treatment.Conclusion: These results demonstrate that constitutive upregulation ofPITX2/IFITM1 cascade is an intrinsic adaptive mechanism during the pathogenesisof letrozole-resistance, and modulation of PITX2/IFITM1 level using differentgenetic and pharmacological means would thus have a novel therapeutic potentialagainst letrozole resistance in BCa.DOI: 10.4143/crt.2018.100 PMID: 30025446
