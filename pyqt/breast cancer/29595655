The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between cfDNA andsurvival outcome.METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Science Citation Indexelectronic databases for studies about the prognostic utility of cfDNA inpatients with BC. The clinical characteristics, relapse/disease-free survival(RFS/DFS), and overall survival (OS) data were extracted from the eligiblestudies. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculatedand pooled with a fixed-effects model using the Stata12.0 software. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed.RESULTS: This meta-analysis included a total of 10 eligible studies and 1127patients with BC. The pooled HR with 95% CI showed strong associations betweencfDNA and OS (HR = 2.41, 95% CI, 1.83-3.16) along with DFS/RFS (HR = 2.73, 95%CI, 2.04-3.67) in patients with BC. Although publication bias was found in thestudies regarding RFS/DFS, further trim and fill analysis revealed that theadjusted HR would be 2.53 (95% CI, 1.83-3.51), which is close to the original HR.Subgroup analyses confirmed the role of cfDNA as a strong prognostic marker inpatients with BC, regardless of cfDNA analysis, sampling time, sample source,detection method, tumor stage, sample size, or area.CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis indicates that cfDNA is a strong predictive andprognostic marker in patients with BC.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010197 PMCID: PMC5895387PMID: 29595655  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
