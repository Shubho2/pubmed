This therapy has a bettertherapeutic index than chemotherapy but can still affect patients' quality oflife (QOL) over time.OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this systematic review were to (1) describe QOLinstruments used in ER-positive (ER+) non-metastatic breast cancer trials and (2)document the longitudinal effects of adjuvant endocrine therapy on the QOL ofpost-menopausal women with ER+ non-metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We searched three electronic bibliographic databases for articlespublished from inception to October 2017 that described (1) a randomizedcontrolled trial (RCT) of non-metastatic breast cancer containing an adjuvantendocrine regimen in at least one arm; (2) the use of a patient self-reportmeasure assessing general or breast cancer-specific QOL; and (3) QOL outcomes at multiple time points during follow-up of at least 5Â years. All included trialswere independently evaluated by two reviewers, and data were extracted usingstandardized forms.RESULTS: In total, 13 studies met our inclusion criteria and were assessed inthis review. The quality of the trials was reasonably good. The top three mostcommonly used QOL instruments in the trials were the Functional Assessment ofCancer Therapy/Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy, the ShortForm-36 and the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life. Most studies found nodifferences between tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor groups in terms of globalQOL. QOL data affected treatment regimen recommendations in a few cases. Ameta-analysis was not feasible because the RCTs included in our review varied in terms of sample size, comparators, QOL instrument used, and timing of QOLmeasurement. Additionally, as no search strategy has perfect sensitivity,specificity and accuracy, there is always a chance that potentially relevantarticles were missed.CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that the QOL of post-menopausal womenis unlikely to be adversely affected by long-term use of adjuvant endocrinetherapy. Efforts are needed to improve the quality of QOL reporting in clinicaltrials.DOI: 10.1007/s41669-018-0070-7 PMID: 29470807
