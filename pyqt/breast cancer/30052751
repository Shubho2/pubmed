[Epub ahead of print]Trans-Vertical Mastectomy With Immediate Implant-Based Reconstruction: ARetrospective, Observational Study.Scheflan M(1), Lotan AM(2), Allweis TM(1)(3).Author information: (1)Assuta Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.(2)Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.(3)Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.Background: In women with large and ptotic breasts requiring a mastectomy andimmediate, implant-based reconstruction, long flaps pose a high risk for flapischemia and necrosis. A new trans-vertical incision for skin-reducing mastectomyis described, which reduces the skin envelope and lifts the breast.Objective: To describe the new mastectomy access incision and assess its efficacyand safety when followed by immediate implant-based reconstruction.Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of 70 consecutive patients (101breasts) with large and ptotic breasts undergoing a unilateral (n=39; 55.7%) orbilateral (n=31; 44.3%) skin-reducing mastectomy using the trans-verticalapproach, either for breast cancer or risk reduction. All received immediate one-(n=86; 85.5%) or two-stage (n=15; 14.5%) implant-based reconstruction usingacellular dermal matrix.Results: Mean age was 50.1 years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.6 kg/m2.After a median follow-up of 4.9 years, the number of breasts with minor and majorcomplications was 21 (20.8%) and 26 (25.7%), respectively. The most common major complications were skin-flap necrosis (n=12; 11.9%) and infection (n=8; 7.9%).All occurred within 3 months post-surgery. There were 7 cases of capsularcontracture (6.9%), and 5 reconstruction failures (5.0%). Higher BMI (p<0.01) andbreast weight (p<0.05) were associated with increased complication rates.According to BREAST-Q, 55/64 patients (85.9%) were somewhat or very satisfiedwith the aesthetic outcome.Conclusions: The trans-vertical approach is an effective, reproducible and safealternative to conventional skin-reducing mastectomy, with favorable aestheticoutcomes, in patients with large and ptotic breasts.DOI: 10.1093/asj/sjy181 PMID: 30052751
