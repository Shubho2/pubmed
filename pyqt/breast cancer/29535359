Intriguingly, the N-terminal domain of Eyas, which does not sharesequence similarity to any known phosphatases, contains a separable Ser/Thrphosphatase activity. Here, we demonstrate that the Ser/Thr phosphatase activity of Eya is not intrinsic, but arises from its direct interaction with the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-B55α holoenzyme. Importantly, Eya3 alters the regulation ofc-Myc by PP2A, increasing c-Myc stability by enabling PP2A-B55α todephosphorylate pT58, in direct contrast to the previously describedPP2A-B56α-mediated dephosphorylation of pS62 and c-Myc destabilization.Furthermore, Eya3 and PP2A-B55α promote metastasis in a xenograft model of breastcancer, opposing the canonical tumor suppressive function of PP2A-B56α. Our studyidentifies Eya3 as a regulator of PP2A, a major cellular Ser/Thr phosphatase, anduncovers a mechanism of controlling the stability of a critical oncogene, c-Myc.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03327-4 PMCID: PMC5849647PMID: 29535359  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
