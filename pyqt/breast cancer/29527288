Gatheringadditional valuable information contained in the datasets represents a crucialopportunity in the biomedical field. To facilitate and stimulate utilization ofthese datasets, we have recently developed an interactive data browsing andvisualization web application, the Gene Expression Browser (GXB). In this note,we describe a curated compendium of 13 public datasets on human breast cancer,representing a total of 2142 transcriptome profiles. We classified the samplesaccording to different immune based classification systems and integrated thisinformation into the datasets. Annotated and harmonized datasets were uploaded toGXB. Study samples were categorized in different groups based on theirimmunologic tumor response profiles, intrinsic molecular subtypes and multipleclinical parameters. Ranked gene lists were generated based on relevant groupcomparisons. In this data note, we demonstrate the utility of GXB to evaluate theexpression of a gene of interest, find differential gene expression betweengroups and investigate potential associations between variables with a specificfocus on immunologic classification in breast cancer.
