Cox proportional hazard analysis was used toanalyze the cancer-specific survival and perform subgroup analysis.Results: The results showed that 12 ELNs was the optimal threshold for thesepatients, and the patients with >12 ELNs had a better cancer-specific survivalbenefit compared with the patients with <12 ELNs (P<0.001).Conclusion: The number 12 can be selected as the optimal threshold of ELNs forbreast cancer patients with >3 positive lymph nodes after modified radicalmastectomy.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S152936 PMCID: PMC5833798PMID: 29520151
