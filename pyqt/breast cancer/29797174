One of the important advantage of CNTs is their needle-like,cylindrical shape. This shape provides a high surface area for multipleconnections and adsorption onto for millions of therapeutic molecules. CNTs canbe internalized by cells via endocytosis, passive diffusion and phagocytosis and release the drug with different effects like pH and temperature. The acidicnature of cancer cells and the susceptibility of CNTs to release the drug in the acidic environment have made it a promising area of research in cancer drugdelivery. In this research, we investigated cell viability, cytotoxicity and drugdelivery in breast cancer cell line by designing non-covalent single walledcarbon nanotubes (SWNT)-doxorubicin (DOX) supramolecular complex that can bedeveloped for cancer therapy. Applied high concentrations of DOX loaded SWNTschanged the actin structure of the cells and prevented the proliferation of thecells. It was showed that doxorubicin loaded SWNTs were more effective than free doxorubicin at relatively small concentrations. Once we applied same procedurefor short and long (short: 1-1.3 µm; long: 2.5-4 µm) SWNTs and compared theresults, more disrupted cell structure and reduction in cell proliferation wereobserved for long CNTs. DOX is bounded more to nanotubes in basic medium, lessbound in acidic environment. Cancer cells were also examined for concentration atwhich they were effective by applying DOX and it was seen that 3.68 µMdoxorubicin kills more than 55% of the cells.DOI: 10.1007/s11033-018-4189-5 PMID: 29797174
