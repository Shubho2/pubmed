Standard dosing of chemotherapy does not take intoaccount the many inter-patient differences that make drug exposure highlyvariable, thus leading to the insurgence of severe toxicity. This is particularlytrue for paclitaxel considering that a relationship between haematologicaltoxicity and plasma exposure was found. Therefore, in order to treat patientswith the correct dose of paclitaxel, improving the overall benefit-risk ratio,Therapeutic Drug Monitoring is necessary. In order to quantify paclitaxel and itsmain metabolite, 6α-hydroxy-paclitaxel, in patients' plasma, we developed a new, sensitive and specific HPLC-MS/MS method applicable to all paclitaxel dosagesused in clinical routine. The developed method used a small volume of plasmasample and is based on quick protein precipitation. The chromatographicseparation of the analytes was achieved with a SunFire™ C18 column (3.5 μM, 92 Å,2,1 x 150 mm); the mobile phases were 0.1% formic acid/bidistilled water and 0.1%formic acid/acetonitrile. The electrospray ionization source worked in positiveion mode and the mass spectrometer operated in selected reaction monitoring mode.Our bioanalytical method was successfully validated according to the FDA-EMAguidelines on bioanalytical method validation. The calibration curves resultedlinear (R2 ≥0.9948) over the concentration ranges (1-10000 ng/mL for paclitaxeland 1-1000 ng/mL for 6α-hydroxy-paclitaxel) and were characterized by a goodaccuracy and precision. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy weredetermined on three quality control concentrations for paclitaxel and6α-hydroxy-paclitaxel and resulted respectively <9.9% and within 91.1-114.8%. In addition, to further verify the assay reproducibility, we tested this method byre-analysing the incurred samples. This bioanalytical method was employed withsuccess to a genotype-guided phase Ib study of weekly paclitaxel in ovariancancer patients treated with a wide range of drug's dosages.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193500 PMCID: PMC5825125PMID: 29474420  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
