Moreover, the effect of lncRNAs on breast cancer is yet unclear. We aimedat examining whether the expression level of these lncRNAs in our breast cancerpatients could be different to normal people, and whether these lncRNAs couldserve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected twelve lncRNAs as the research targets, whichwere previously found to be abnormally expressed in plasma of other cancers. The expression levels of these lncRNAs were measured by Quantitative Real-timePolymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and compared between breast cancer patientsand normal people.RESULTS: The expression levels of plasma lncRNAs (H19, HOTAIR, and RP11-445H22.4)are found to increase significantly in breast cancer patients. The expressionlevels of other 9 lncRNAs were no significant changed compared with normalpeople.CONCLUSIONS: lncRNAs may be related to the occurrence of breast cancer and serve as potential biomarkers for its diagnosis.PMID: 29687854
