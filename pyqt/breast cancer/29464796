Among all the tested vanilloids, Vn16(6-shogaol) exhibited the most potent cytotoxic effects against human colorectal cancer cells (HT-29). The apoptotic induction effects exhibited by Vn16 on HT-29 cells were confirmed using dual staining fluorescence microscopy andenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of Vn16 on regulation of 43apoptotic-related markers were determined in HT-29. The results suggested that 8 apoptotic markers (caspase 8, BAD, BAX, second mitochondrial-derived activator,caspase 3, survivin, bcl-2, and cIAP-2) were either upregulated or downregulated.These results further support the chemopreventive properties of foods thatcontain vanilloids.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6051 PMID: 29464796
