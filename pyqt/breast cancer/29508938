We aimed to create a Chinese version of EPIC to further research in the Chinese-speakingpopulation.METHODS: A prototype was created by forward-backward translations and revisions. During cultural adaptation, 15 participants were interviewed after they hadcompleted the prototype. A few issues highlighted included confusion related tothe question format, subject non-familiarity with the Chinese term for "hotflashes," and the use of the Chinese term for "breast" as a strictly female body part. A pilot version was created based on the cultural adaptation findings.Validation of the pilot version was performed by having 50 participants complete the Chinese EPIC and EORTC QLQ-c30 twice within a 4-week period. Test-retestreliability (Pearson's correlations and difference distribution) and internalconsistency (Cronbach's α) were measured using SAS version 9.4.RESULTS: Test-retest reliability values for the urinary, bowel, sexual andhormone domains were 0.71, 0.51, 0.51 and 0.66, respectively; subscaletest-retest reliability ranged between 0.29 and 0.82. Internal consistency fordomains was good with Cronbach's α ranging from 0.76 to 0.78 for the initial testand 0.67 to 0.85 for the retest. The performance of this version of EPIC wascomparable to the validated EORTC QLQ-C30.CONCLUSION: The EPIC questionnaire was successfully translated into Chinese andwas culturally adapted. The resultant Chinese version has high reliability andvalidity and will be an important tool for research on quality of life in theChinese population.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ajco.12855 PMID: 29508938  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
