The goal of MSTS is to improve the quality of life of the patientswith spinal metastases and rarely for oncological control which is usuallyachieved by adjuvant therapies. Hence outcome measures such as length of stay(LOS) and rate of complications after MSTS are important indicators of qualitybut there is limited literature evidence for the same. We carried out aretrospective study to determine the incidence and the factors influencing normal(nLOS) and extended length of stay (eLOS) after MSTS. Data of 220 consecutivepatients who underwent MSTS between 2005 and 2015 were retrieved from hospitalelectronic records. The preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative variables,discharge destinations as well as socioeconomic factors were analyzed. eLOSdefined as positive when the LOS exceeded the 75th percentile for this cohort,was the key outcome indicator. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressionanalyses were performed to determine the predictive factors of eLOS. The overall median LOS was 7 days (1-30 days) and 55 patients had eLOS (LOS ≥ 11 days).Multivariate analysis revealed that significant variables independentlyassociated with eLOS were instrumentation >9 spinal segmental levels (OR 2.89,95% CI 1.1-7.5, p = 0.032) and presence of postoperative complications (OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.85-7.30, p < 0.001). Metastatic tumours other than breast, prostate and lung have lesser risk of eLOS (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14-0.70, p = 0.004). Survivalestimates show that patients with eLOS have shorter survival than patients withnLOS (Crude HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.13-2.89, p = 0.003).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
