The evaluation of 25 basal breast lines expressing GLS1, predominantly through its splice isoformGAC, demonstrated that only GLS1-dependent basal B lines required it formaintaining de novo glutathione synthesis in addition to mitochondrialbioenergetics. Drug sensitivity profiling of 407 tumor lines with GLS1 andgamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) inhibitors revealed a high degree ofco-dependency on both enzymes across indications, suggesting that redox balanceis a key function of GLS1 in tumors. To leverage these findings, we derived apan-cancer metabolic signature predictive of GLS1/GCS co-dependency and validatedit in vivo using four lung patient-derived xenograft models, revealing theadditional requirement for expression of GAC above a threshold (log2RPKM + 1 ≥4.5, where RPKM is reads per kilobase per million mapped reads). Analysis of the pan-TCGA dataset with our signature identified multiple indications, includingmesenchymal tumors, as putative responders to GLS1 inhibitors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
