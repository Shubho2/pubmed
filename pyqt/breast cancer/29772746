HSA (human serumalbumin) and DNA were studied using absorption titration, fluorescencetechniques, and in silico molecular docking studies. The results exhibited thesignificant binding propensity of both complexes 1 and 2, but complex 1 showedmore avid binding to HSA and DNA. Also, the nuclease activity of 1 and 2 wasanalyzed for pBR322 DNA, and the results obtained confirmed the potential of the complexes to cleave DNA. Moreover, the mechanistic pathway was studied in thepresence of various radical scavengers, which revealed that ROS (reactive oxygen species) are responsible for the nuclease activity in complex 1, whereas incomplex 2, the possibility of hydrolytic cleavage also exists. Furthermore, thecytotoxicity of the ligand and complexes 1 and 2 were studied on a panel of five different human cancer cells, namely: HepG2, SK-MEL-1, HT018, HeLa, and MDA-MB231, and compared with the standard drug, cisplatin. The results are quitepromising against MDA-MB 231 (breast cancer cell line of 1), with an IC50 valuethat is nearly the same as the standard drug. Apoptosis was induced by complex 1 on MDA-MB 231 cells predominantly as studied by flow cytometry (FACS). Theadhesion and migration of cancer cells were also examined upon treatment ofcomplexes 1 and 2. Furthermore, the in vivo chronic toxicity profile of complexes1 and 2 was also studied on all of the major organs of the mice, and found themto be less toxic. Thus, the results warrant further investigations of complex 1.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19051492 PMCID: PMC5983663PMID: 29772746
