The incidence of BM as first site of recurrence and the cumulative BMincidence were computed. We used the Cox proportional hazards model to identifythe univariate and multivariate factors associated with survival.RESULTS: Four hundred thirty three patients were included with a median overallsurvival (OS) of 21.6 months after median follow-up for 48.1 months. BM was foundin 29% (127/433) of the patients and about a quarter (32/127) of BM was firstrecurrence. The cumulative incidence of BM at 1 and 2 years was 17 and 25%,respectively. The median time from the diagnosis of extracranial metastases to BMwas 10 months. Median OS following a diagnosis of BM was 7.3 months. The longermedian OS from time of first recurrent BM was noted compared with those ofsubsequent recurrent (17.3 vs 6.3 months, p = 0.008). However, patients withfirst recurrent BM were associated with shorter OS compared with those without BM(17.3 vs 22.1 months, p = 0.006). The independent factors that increased BM deathrisk were > 3 brain lesions, no BM-directed treatment, subsequent recurrent BM,symptomatic BM and uncontrolled extracranial metastasis.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mTNBC have a high incidence of early BM withsubsequent poor survival. The findings lend support to consideration of screeningimaging of the brain for mTNBC patients.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4371-0 PMCID: PMC5909254PMID: 29673325
