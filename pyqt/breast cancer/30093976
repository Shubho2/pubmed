For patients with 2 primary cancers(n=205), the most common cancer pairs were bilateral breast (37.5%), breast-ovary(11.7%), endometrium-ovary (9.2%), colon-endometrium (3.9%) and colon-colon(3.4%). 42.3% patients underwent gene testing including 110/231 (47.6%) withmultiple malignancies. Pathogenic variants were found more frequently in younger patients, in those with a family history of cancer related to the suspectedsyndrome, and a trend towards significance in those with multiple primary cancers(35.5% vs. 25.6%, p = 0.09). In patients with multiple cancers, pathogenicvariants were most commonly identified in BRCA1 (38.5%), BRCA2 (17.9%), and themismatch repair genes (20.5%), while 23.1% of pathogenic mutations were in other moderate- to high-penetrance cancer predisposition genes including APC, ATM,MUTYH, PALB2, RAD50 and TP53.Conclusion: Patients with multiple cancers were more likely to carry pathogenicmutations than those with single cancer. About three-quarters of deleteriousmutations in patients with multiple primary cancers were in BRCA1/2 and themismatch repair genes, but multi-gene panel testing facilitated the detection of mutations in another 6 genes and is warranted in this high-risk population.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25769 PMCID: PMC6078133PMID: 30093976
