Iran.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is malignant disease with high mortality rate amongwomen in the world. It is necessary to diagnose breast cancer at the early stage before it metastasizes in patients.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this is the evaluation of 99mTc-(tricine)-HYNIC-Lys-FROPfor breast tumor imaging.METHOD: Lys-FROP peptide was labeled with 99mTc using HYNIC as chelator andtricine as co-ligand. Specific binging of this radiolabeled peptide on breastcancerous cell was assessed in different cell lines as well as in tumor bearingmice.RESULTS: HYNIC-Lys-FROP peptide was labeled with 99mTc at radiochemical puritymore than 99%. It was observed high stability in normal saline and serum about95%. A highest cellular uptake was observed in MCF-7 breast tumor cells treatedwith 99mTc-(tricine)-HYNIC-Lys-FROP as compared to other cell lines (lung,ovarian, T47D breast cancer cell lines). Biodistribution results in female MCF-7 tumor bearing mice showed the relatively high tumor uptake and tumor-muscle ratioas 3.82 ± 0.66 after 15 min post-injection of 99mTc-(tricine)-HYNIC-Lys-FROP.Tumor uptake was reduced in mice that were co-injected with excess of unlabeledpeptide to be 0.91 ± 0.08. Conclusion Findings showed this radiolabeled peptideis a promising candidate for tumor targeting and molecular imaging of breastcancer.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1871520618666180307142027 PMID: 29521248
