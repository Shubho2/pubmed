This activation involves therecruitment of specific proteins with activities that are still not fullyunderstood. Timeless, the human homolog of the Drosophila gene involved incircadian rhythm, was previously shown to be a strong predictor of tamoxifenrelapse, and is involved in genomic stability and cell cycle control. In thisstudy, we investigated the interplay between Timeless and ERα, and showed thathuman Timeless is an ERα coactivator. Timeless binds to ERα and enhances itstranscriptional activity. Overexpressing Timeless increases PARP1 expression and enhances ERα-induced gene regulation through the proximal LXXLL motif on Timelessprotein and ERα PARylation. Finally, Timeless is recruited with ERα on the GREB1 and cMyc promoters. These data, the first to link Timeless to steroid hormonefunction, provide a mechanistic basis for its clinical association with tamoxifenresistance. Thus, our results identify Timeless as another key regulator of ERαin controlling ERα transactivation.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.DOI: 10.1016/j.jmb.2018.03.008 PMID: 29555554
