[Epub ahead of print]Indications for biopsy of imaging-detected intramammary and axillary lymph nodes in the absence of concurrent breast cancer.Dialani V(1), Westra C(2), Venkataraman S(1), Fein-Zachary V(1), Brook A(1),Mehta T(1).Author information: (1)Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.(2)Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.To evaluate the prevalence of malignancy in imaging-detected abnormal lymph nodes(LNs) in women without concurrent cancer and to identify imaging featurespredictive of malignancy in this population. This is an IRB-approved study withwaived informed consent. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of allimage-guided LN FNAs and CNBs performed at our institution from 1/1/08 through12/31/10. LNs sampled in patients without concurrent breast cancer comprised our study group (SG; n = 77), and with concurrent breast cancer our reference group(RG; n = 124). Blinded to cytology/histology, imaging features of the LNsincluding size, loss of fatty hilum, and cortical thickness were reviewed. Alow/high suspicion category was then assigned based on LN appearance. Theprevalence of malignancy in LNs in SG was 6% (5/77) and in RG 52% (64/124;P < .0001). Complete loss of fatty hilum had 100% (5/5) sensitivity, and 100%(56/56) NPV for detecting cancer in SG, compared to 39% (25/64) sensitivity and61% (60/99) NPV in RG. When a "high suspicion" imaging feature was used as athreshold to biopsy, the sensitivity (5/5) and NPV (45/45) in SG were 100%, andin RG 78% (50/64) and 77% (47/61), respectively. The prevalence of cancer inimaging-detected abnormal LNs in patients without concurrent breast cancer islow. In the absence of concurrent cancer, using highly suspicious features ofloss of fatty hilum or cortical thickness ≥ 5 mm as a threshold to biopsy willmaintain high sensitivity with lower false-positive biopsy rate.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13009 PMID: 29517168
