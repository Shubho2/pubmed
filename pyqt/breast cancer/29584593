Materialsand Methods This retrospective study had institutional review board approval and was HIPAA compliant. All consecutive cases in which patients with AD wereultimately assigned Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4 or 5categories from 2009 to 2016 were reviewed by three readers for visibility (2D vsDBT). The level of suspicion was assigned using a Likert scale. Pathologicresults were compared between 2D-detected and DBT-detected AD. Frequencies werecompared by using the McNemar and Pearson χ2 exact tests. Results One hundredeighty-one AD lesions were included; 122 (67.4%) were 2D visible while 59 (32.6%)were DBT detected. Forty-two women (with 43 lesions) underwent 2D mammographyprior to initiation of DBT. In 117 women with 121 AD lesions who underwent 2Dmammography plus DBT, 59 lesions (48.8%) were detected only with DBT. Themalignancy rate based on final pathology was significantly higher for 2D-detectedAD (53 [43.4%] of 122) compared with DBT (six [10.2%] of 59) (P < .001). A UScorrelate was more frequent with 2D-detected AD (103 [84.4%] of 122) than DBT (33[55.9%] of 59) (P < .001). Malignancy rate was not different for DBT-detected AD with (four [12.1%] of 33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4%, 28.2%]) or without (two [7.7%] of 26; 95% CI: 0.9%, 25.1%]) a US correlate. NPV based onradiologists' level of suspicion was high (91.8%-98.0%) but not sufficient enoughto forgo biopsy. Conclusion DBT-detected suspicious AD has a lower malignancyoutcome compared with 2D mammography-detected suspicious AD, although still high enough to warrant biopsy. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018171159 PMID: 29584593  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
