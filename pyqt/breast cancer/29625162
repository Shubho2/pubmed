Doxorubicin and/or curcumin were loaded into the carrier via asimple diffusion deposition approach, with encapsulation efficiencies (EE) forcurcumin and doxorubicin of 93.03 ± 0.3% and 97.37 ± 0.12% respectively. Theco-loading of curcumin and doxorubicin led to a total EE of 76.02 ± 0.48%.Release studies were carried out at pH 7.4 and 5.3, and revealed a greater extentof release at pH 5.3, showing the formulations to have potential applications in tumor microenvironments. Cytotoxicity assays, fluorescence imaging and flowcytometry demonstrated that the formulations could effectively inhibit the growthof MCF-7 (breast) and HEpG2 (liver) cancer cells, being more potent than the freedrug molecules both in terms of dose and duration of action. Additionally,hemolysis tests and cytotoxicity evaluations determined the drug-loaded carriers to be non-toxic towards non-cancerous cells. These formulations thus have greatpotential in the development of new cancer therapeutics.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejpb.2018.04.001 PMID: 29625162
