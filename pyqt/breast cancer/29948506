Recently, some studies indicate that ARNT2 is associated with theoccurrence and development of carcinoma. However, its roles in gastric cancer(GC) remain unclear. In the present study, we found that ARNT2 expression levelis lower in GC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues, and negativelycorrelated with depth of invasion of the tumor, differentiated degree, and poorsurvival of GC patients. Overexpression of ARNT2 inhibits cell proliferation.Furthermore, AKT pathway contributed to ARNT2 -mediated PC proliferation. Takentogether, our results provide the first evidence that high expression of ARNT2inhibited proliferation of GC cells and affected tumor aggressiveness in GCpatients.DOI: 10.1007/s11010-018-3376-y PMID: 29948506
