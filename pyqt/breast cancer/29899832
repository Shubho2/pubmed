In addition, the subtype specific expression of drug targets has been investigated.Methods: Absolute quantification (nCounter) of a 64-gene panel was performed onMIBC patients (n=47) treated exclusively with radical cystectomy (RC). Inconjunction of 170 MIBCs from 3 independent cohorts, a minimal set of consensusgenes has been established. Survival of the consensus subtypes has been assessed by multivariate analysis. Relevant drug targets were tested for their subtypespecificity in a clustering independent assessment.Results: A reduced 36-gene panel stably clustered into 3 subtypes throughout the cohorts (luminal, basal, infiltrated). Patients treated by RC only, showed worst 8-year disease specific survival (DSS) for the luminal subtype in contrast to theinfiltrated subtype (17% vs. 73%, p=0.011). In multivariate analyses, the riskstratification based on luminal versus not-luminal MIBC proved to be anindependent predictor for DSS superior to the TNM system in patients with RC.Drug targets (e.g. ERBB2, FGFR, AR, PDGFRB) showed a distinct subtypeattribution. The subtypes based on this nCounter screening could further bevalidated by the TCGA cohort.Conclusion: This MIBC subtype screening predicted survival and allowed ananalysis of subtype specific drug targets, thus being a powerful tool for thetranslation of personalized MIBC treatment concepts.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25407 PMCID: PMC5995241PMID: 29899832
