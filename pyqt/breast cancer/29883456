The developedmethodology integrates concepts from stochastic network theory with knownmodulatory features of the vascular bed, and in doing so provides access to apreviously unrecognized dense feature space that is shown to have promisingdiagnostic potential. Notable features of the methodology include access to this information solely from measures acquired in the resting state, and analysis ofthese by treating the various components of the hemoglobin (Hb) signal as aco-varying interacting system.APPROACH: The principal data-transform kernel projects Hb state-spacetrajectories onto a coordinate system that constitutes a finite-staterepresentation of covariations among the principal elements of the Hb signal(i.e., its oxygenated (ΔoxyHb) and deoxygenated (ΔdeoxyHb) forms and theassociated dependent quantities: total hemoglobin (ΔtotalHb = ΔoxyHb + ΔdeoxyHb),hemoglobin oxygen saturation (ΔHbO2Sat = 100Δ(oxyHb/totalHb)), andtissue-hemoglobin oxygen exchange (ΔHbO2Exc = ΔdeoxyHb-ΔoxyHb)). The resultingten-state representation treats the evolution of this signal as a one-space,spatiotemporal network that undergoes transitions from one state to another.States of the network are defined by the algebraic signs of the amplitudes of thetime-varying components of the Hb signal relative to their temporal mean values. This assignment produces several classes of coefficient arrays, most with adimension of 10×10.BIOLOGICAL MOTIVATION: Motivating our approach is the understanding that effectormechanisms that modulate blood delivery to tissue operate on macroscopic scales, in a spatially and temporally varying manner. Also recognized is that thisbehavior is sensitive to nonlinear actions of these effectors, which include the binding properties of hemoglobin. Accessible phenomenology includes measures ofthe kinetics and probabilities of network dynamics, which we treat as surrogates for the actions of feedback mechanisms that modulate tissue-vascular coupling.FINDINGS: Qualitative and quantitative features of this space, and theirpotential to serve as markers of disease, have been explored by examiningcontinuous-wave fNIRS 3D tomographic time series obtained from the breasts ofwomen who do and do not have breast cancer. Inspection of the coefficient arrays reveals that they are governed predominantly by first-order rate processes, andthat each array class exhibits preferred structure that is mainly independent of the others. Discussed are strategies that may serve to extend evaluation of theaccessible feature space and how the character of this information holdspotential for development of novel clinical and preclinical uses.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198210 PMCID: PMC5993307PMID: 29883456
