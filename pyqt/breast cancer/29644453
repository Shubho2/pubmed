Clinicians mustdecide between serial imaging or biopsy of the mass. Herein, we identifymanagement differences in those with and without a positive family history, aswell as identify cost differences.METHODS: An institutional retrospective review was performed of patients(2-18 years of age) with a diagnosis of breast mass. Patient demographics,presentation, medical and surgical history, physical exam, imaging, andpathologic diagnosis were collected. Cost data were acquired from the pediatrichealth information system (PHIS). Costs were compared between patients managed bybiopsy versus serial ultrasounds. Bivariate analyses including Pearson'sChi-square, student's t tests, and logistic regression were performed.RESULTS: The probability of biopsy increases with age (p = 0.0001) and femalegender (p = 0.006). Biopsy rate is higher for larger masses (p < 0.0001), growingsize (p < 0.0001), and in patients with a positive family history of breastcancer (p < 0.0001). The average cost of care for management with initialexcisional biopsy was $4491 versus those with serial ultrasounds ($986)(p < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with small lesions, even with a family history of breastcancer, non-operative monitoring is a safe and cost-effective alternative toinvasive biopsy.DOI: 10.1007/s00383-018-4268-7 PMID: 29644453
