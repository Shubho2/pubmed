In humans, the similar TLK1 and TLK2 interact with each other and TLK activity enhances ASF1 histone binding and is inhibited by the DNA damage response, although the molecular mechanisms of TLK regulation remainunclear. Here we describe the crystal structure of the TLK2 kinase domain. Weshow that the coiled-coil domains mediate dimerization and are essential foractivation through ordered autophosphorylation that promotes higher orderoligomers that locally increase TLK2 activity. We show that TLK2 mutationsinvolved in intellectual disability impair kinase activity, and the docking ofseveral small-molecule inhibitors of TLK activity suggest that the crystalstructure will be useful for guiding the rationale design of new inhibitionstrategies. Together our results provide insights into the structure andmolecular regulation of the TLKs.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04941-y PMCID: PMC6023931PMID: 29955062
