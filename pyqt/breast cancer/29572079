The increasing numbers of mastectomyprocedures and improved patient survival have placed an increasing emphasis onthe aesthetic and psychosocial outcomes, prompting surgeons to develop moresophisticated methods to reconstruct the breast mound. Significant improvementshave been made to existing implant and autologous methods of PMBR in recentdecades in an effort to reduce donor site morbidity and complication rates andimprove cosmesis. The limitations of contemporary methods of PMBR have directedresearch toward more novel techniques such as autologous fat grafting and adiposetissue engineering. The present review discusses recent advances in the evolutionof contemporary approaches to breast reconstruction and the future directions of PMBR using adipose tissue engineering strategies.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
