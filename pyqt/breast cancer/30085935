The midpoint transverse process to pleura blocks served as the major component of multimodal analgesia. Withultrasound guidance, 7 mL of a mixture of 0.75% ropivacaine and 2% lidocaine withepinephrine were deposited at T2, T4, and T6 levels. We noted decreased sensationto cold and pinprick from T2 to T8 dermatome level with sparing of axilla andinfraclavicular areas. The maximum pain numeric rating scale score (0-10) was 4out on movement and none had mean 24-hour numeric rating scale >3.DOI: 10.1213/XAA.0000000000000850 PMID: 30085935
