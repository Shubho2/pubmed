It has been recently shown that RNA transcripts targeted by the samemiRNA could "compete" for the miRNA molecules and thereby indirectly regulateeach other. Experimental evidence has suggested that the aberration of suchmiRNA-mediated interaction between RNAs-called competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)interaction-can play important roles in tumorigenesis. Given the difficulty ofdeciphering context-specific miRNA binding, and the existence of various generegulatory factors such as DNA methylation and copy number alteration, inferring context-specific ceRNA interactions accurately is a computationally challengingtask. Here we propose a computational method called Cancerin to identifycancer-associated ceRNA interactions. Cancerin incorporates DNA methylation, copynumber alteration, gene and miRNA expression datasets to constructcancer-specific ceRNA networks. We applied Cancerin to three cancer datasets fromthe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Our results indicated that ceRNAs wereenriched with cancer-related genes, and ceRNA modules in the inferred ceRNAnetworks were involved in cancer-associated biological processes. UsingLINCS-L1000 shRNA-mediated gene knockdown experiment in breast cancer cell lineto assess accuracy, Cancerin was able to predict expression outcome of ceRNAgenes with high accuracy.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006318 PMID: 30011266
