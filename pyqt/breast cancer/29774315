However, they have some associations, synchronouspresentation of these tumors is rare. We presented 12 patients diagnosed asbreast and thyroid cancer and treated at the same time.Materials and Methods: Mastectomy and thyroidectomy were performed in 19 patientsat the same time. 7 patients were excluded because of benign thyroid pathology.Therefore 12 patients who had diagnosis of synchronous breast and thyroid cancer were included. Data regarding clinical, pathological, treatment and prognosticfactors was retrospectively analyzed.Results: Total thyroidectomy was performed in all patients. The mean age ofpatients was 54 years (min. 44-max. 70). Only one patient was male. Thyroidpathology was detected preoperatively by FDG PET-CT scan in 11 patients. Breastreconstruction was performed in three patients. The most commonly seen thyroidmalignancy was papillary thyroid carcinoma. Postoperative complication rate was33.3%. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in 11 patients whereas one patientreceived adjuvant radiotherapy.Conclusion: Although synchronous presentation of breast and thyroid cancer israre, surgical treatment of both of these tumors can be safely performed at thesame time. Association of these tumors should be evaluated by large scaledstudies.DOI: 10.5152/ejbh.2018.3853 PMCID: PMC5939983PMID: 29774315
