Canfield, Detroit, MI, 48201, USA. bsloane@med.wayne.edu.About one fourth of all newly identified cases of breast carcinoma are diagnoses of breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Since we cannot yet distinguish DCIScases that would remain indolent from those that may progress to life-threateninginvasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), almost all women undergo aggressive treatment.In order to allow for more rational individualized treatment, we and others aredeveloping in vitro models to identify and validate druggable pathways thatmediate the transition of DCIS to IDC. These models range from conventionaltwo-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures on plastic to 3D cultures in natural orsynthetic matrices. Some models consist solely of DCIS cells, either cell linesor primary cells. Others are co-cultures that include additional cell typespresent in the normal or cancerous human breast. The 3D co-culture models moreaccurately mimic structural and functional changes in breast architecture thataccompany the transition of DCIS to IDC. Mechanistic studies of the dynamic andtemporal changes associated with this transition are facilitated by adapting the in vitro models to engineered microfluidic platforms. Ultimately, the goal is to create in vitro models that can serve as a reproducible preclinical screen fortesting therapeutic strategies that will reduce progression of DCIS to IDC. This review will discuss the in vitro models that are currently available, as well as the progress that has been made using them to understand DCIS pathobiology.DOI: 10.1007/s10911-018-9405-3 PMID: 30056557
