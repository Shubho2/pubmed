It is based on the use of a compositeconsisting of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and copper sulfide (CuS) that wasplaced on a screen-printed graphite electrode. The electrode shows excellentactivity towards the oxidation of catechol acting as an electrochemical probe,best at a working potential of 0.16 V. The electrode was modified with antibodyagainst CA15-3. Once the analyte (CA15-3) binds to the surface of the electrode, the response to catechol is reduced. The assay has a linear response in the1.0-150 U mL-1 CA15-3 concentration range, with a 0.3 U mL-1 lower detectionlimit and a sensitivity of 1.88 μA μM-1 cm-2. The immunosensor also shows goodreproducibility (2.7%), stability (95% of the initial values after storing forfour weeks). The method was successfully applied to the determination of CA15-3in serum samples, and results were found to compare well to those obtained by an ELISA. Conceivably, this nanocomposite based detection scheme has a wider scopeand may be applied to numerous other immunoassays. Graphical abstract Alabel-free electrochemical immunosensor based on copper sulfides/graphenenanocomposites was developed for enzyme-free determination of CA15-3 biomarker.This immunosensor can be utilized as a tool to detect of CA15-3 in real samples.DOI: 10.1007/s00604-017-2532-5 PMID: 29594363
