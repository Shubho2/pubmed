Overall survival was assessed according to whether ornot patients received adjuvant radiotherapy through Kaplan-Meier analysis.Univariate and multivariate analyses of predictors of overall and relapse-freesurvival were conducted through Cox regression analysis.RESULTS: Locoregional relapse rates (after a median follow up of 116 months) were5.6% among patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy vs. 6.6% among patientswho did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy. Actuarial 5‑ and 10-year locoregional relapse-free survival rates were 94 and 93%, respectively, among patients who didnot receive adjuvant radiotherapy versus 95 and 92% among patients who receivedadjuvant radiotherapy. The following factors were associated with worse overallsurvival in multivariate Cox regression analysis: age < 40 years (P < 0.0001), T2stage (P = 0.004), higher lymph node ratio (P < 0.0001), and negative hormonereceptor status (P < 0.0001). Likewise, the following factors were predictive of shorter locoregional relapse-free survival: age ≤ 40 (P < 0.0001), no PMRT(P = 0.034), fluorouracil/adriamycin/cyclophosphamide (FAC) chemotherapy(P = 0.001), and higher T stage (P = 0.002).CONCLUSION: The current analysis does not show a beneficial impact of PMRT onoverall or relapse-free survival among patients with T1-T2 N1 disease whoreceived standard adjuvant systemic therapy. There is, however, evidence ofimprovement in locoregional relapse-free survival with PMRT. These findings need to be prospectively validated.DOI: 10.1007/s00066-018-1343-x PMID: 30069737
