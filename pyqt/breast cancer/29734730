Therefore, inhibition ofthe Shh pathway downstream molecule Glioma-associated Oncogene Homolog (Gli) was investigated for its ability to reduce progression and invasiveness ofpatient-derived breast cancer cells and cell lines. Human primary breast cancerT2 cells with high expression of Shh signaling pathway molecules were comparedwith breast cancer line MDA-MB-231 cells. The therapeutic effects of Gliinhibitors were examined in terms of the cell proliferation, apoptosis, cancerstem cells, cell migration and gene expression. Blockade of the Shh signalingpathway could reduce cell proliferation and migration only in MDA-MB-231 cells.Hh pathway inhibitor-1 (HPI-1) increased the percentages of late apoptotic cells in MDA-MB-231 cells and early apoptotic cells in T2 cells. It reduced Bcl2expression for cell proliferation and increased Bim expression for apoptosis. In addition, Gli inhibitor HPI-1 decreased significantly the percentages of cancerstem cells in T2 cells. HPI-1 worked more effectively than GANT-58 against breastcarcinoma cells. In conclusion, HPI-1 could inhibit cell proliferation, reducecell invasion and decrease cancer stem cell population in breast cancer cells. Totarget Gli-1 could be a potential strategy to suppress breast cancer stem cells.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19051375 PMCID: PMC5983844PMID: 29734730
