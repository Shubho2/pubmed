Patient-reported symptoms have been included less often. Our group has assessed all patients with the EdmontonSymptom Assessment System (ESAS, a one-sheet questionnaire addressing 11 majorsymptoms and wellbeing on a numeric scale of 0-10) before palliative radiotherapy(PRT) since 2012. Therefore, we were able to analyze the prognostic impact ofbaseline ESAS symptom severity.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 102 patients treatedwith PRT between 2012 and 2015. All ESAS items were analyzed by two differentmethods, dichotomized by median score and by score <4 vs. ≥4. Uni- andmultivariable analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors forsurvival, and from these a 4-tiered score was developed.RESULTS: The most common tumor types were prostate, breast and non-small celllung cancer, predominantly with distant metastases. Despite differences betweenthe two methods of ESAS data handling, the final multivariable models werestrikingly similar. Therefore, the better reproducible cut-off was chosen, i.e. ascore ≥4. Multivariable analyses resulted in 4 significant prognostic factors,which contributed equally to the 4-tiered survival score (performance status,more than one cancer diagnosis, progressive disease outside the PRT targetvolume(s), ESAS appetite). Estimated median survival for different point sums was24.5 months (0), 8.4 months (1), 4.7 months (2) and 3.0 months (3), p=0.0001.CONCLUSION: This score identified patients with different survival outcomes,including a good prognostic group with median survival of approximately 2 years. The results may be useful to inform PRT fractionation.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12404 PMID: 29491105  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
