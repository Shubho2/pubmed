It is reported that the efficacy of axitinib (AX), a VEGFR inhibitor, is limited in the treatment of breast cancer as a single agent or in combination with otherchemotherapeutic drugs due to the probability of rising population of cancerstem-like cells (CSCs) caused by AX. The present study evaluated the effect ofdopamine (DA) improving AX's efficacy on MCF-7/ADR breast cancer in vitro and in vivo, and developed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model describingthe in vivo experimental data and characterizing the interaction of effectbetween AX and DA. The results showed that AX up-regulated the expression ofbreast CSC (BCSC) markers (CD44+/CD24-/low) in vivo, and DA significantlysynergized the inhibitory effect on tumor growth by deducting the BCSC frequency.The PK-PD model quantitatively confirmed the synergistic interaction with theparameter estimate of interaction factor ψ 2.43. The dose regimen was optimizedas 60 mg/kg AX i.g. b.i.d. combined with 50 mg/kg DA i.p. q3d in the simulationstudy on the basis of the PK-PD model. The model where DA synergisticallyenhances the effect of AX in an all-or-none manner provides a possible solutionin modeling the agents like DA. Moreover, the outcome of AX and DA combinationtherapy in MCF-7/ADR breast cancer provided further insight of co-administeringDA in the treatment of the possible CSC-causing AX-resisting breast cancer. Andthis combination therapy has the prospect of clinical translation.DOI: 10.1038/s41401-018-0006-x PMID: 29773888
