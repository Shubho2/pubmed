[Epub ahead of print]MRI-guided breast biopsy: a review of technique, indications, andradiological-pathological correlations.Papalouka V(1), Kilburn-Toppin F(2), Gaskarth M(1), Gilbert F(1).Author information: (1)Department of Radiology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, UK.(2)Department of Radiology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, UK. Electronicaddress: fleur.kilburn-toppin@addenbrookes.nhs.uk.Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the technique of choice in detection, local staging, and monitoring of breast cancer; however, breast MRI results inthe detection of more indeterminate/suspicious lesions that need to behistopathologically proven to guide patient management than any other breastimaging method. If such abnormalities are not detectable in any of theconventional imaging tools (mammography (MMG) or ultrasound) then an MRI-guidedbiopsy needs to be performed to obtain a diagnosis. Breast MRI-guided biopsy is atime-consuming and complex procedure that requires specific equipment andexperienced, well-trained staff. This review article explores and illustrates theindications, the currently available technologies, and the technique of breastMRI-guided biopsy, and explains the importance of careful imaging review andselection of cases. We correlate the radiological-pathological findings andhighlight the impact on patient management in a multidisciplinary setting.Copyright Â© 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
