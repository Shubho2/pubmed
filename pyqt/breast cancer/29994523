Epub 2018 May 16.CMOS High-Voltage Analog 1-64 Multiplexer/Demultiplexer for Integrated UltrasoundGuided Breast Needle Biopsy.Jung H, Wodnicki R, Lim HG, Yoon CW, Kang BJ, Yoon C, Lee C, Hwang JY, Kim HH,Choi H, Chen MS, Zhou Q, Shung KK.Ultrasound guided needle biopsy is an important method for collection of breastcancer tissue. In this paper, we report on the design and testing of ahigh-voltage 1 to 64 Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (MUX/De-MUX) integrated circuit(IC) for ultrasound-guided breast biopsy applications implemented in ahigh-voltage CMOS process. The IC is intended to be incorporated inside thebreast biopsy needle and is designed to fit inside the needle inner diameter of2.38 mm. The MUX/De-MUX electronics are made up of three parts, including alow-voltage 6 to 64 decoder, a level shifter to convert from low voltage to high voltage, and analog high-voltage switches. Experimental results show a -3-dBbandwidth of over 70 MHz, Rds (on) of , -2.279-dB insertion loss, and -17.5-dBoff isolation at 70 MHz with low-voltage input. Finally, we present resultsobtained via synthetic aperture imaging using the fabricated MUX/De-Mux deviceand a high-frequency ultrasound array. This device and technique hold promise forhigh-frequency imaging probes where a limited number of elements are used and thedepth of penetration is short such as in breast biopsy and intravascularapplications.DOI: 10.1109/TUFFC.2018.2837127 PMID: 29994523
