We aimed toevaluate the efficacy of dual anti-HER2 treatment with or without metronomicchemotherapy in older patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial in 30centres from eight countries in Europe, in patients with histologically proven,HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, without previous chemotherapy formetastatic disease, who were 70 years or older, or 60 years or older withconfirmed functional restrictions defined by protocol, and had a life expectancy of more than 12 weeks and a performance status according to WHO scale of 0-3.Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an online randomisation system based on the minimisation method to receive metronomic oral cyclophosphamide 50mg per day plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab, or trastuzumab and pertuzumab alone. Trastuzumab was given intravenously with a loading dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by 6mg/kg every 3 weeks. Pertuzumab was given intravenously with a loading dose of840 mg, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks. Patients were stratified by hormonereceptor positivity, previous HER2 treatment, and baseline geriatric screening.The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival at 6months as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. A difference of 10% or greater between the two groups was sought. Efficacyanalyses were by intention to treat; safety was assessed in all patients whoreceived at least one dose of study treatment. In case of progression, allpatients were offered trastuzumab emtansine. This trial is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01597414, and is completed.FINDINGS: Between July 2, 2013, and May 10, 2016, 80 patients, of whom 56 (70%)had a potential frailty profile according to the geriatric screening G8 score(≤14), were randomly assigned to receive trastuzumab and pertuzumab (n=39) ortrastuzumab and pertuzumab plus metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (n=41).Estimated progression-free survival at 6 months was 46·2% (95% CI 30·2-60·7) withtrastuzumab and pertuzumab versus 73·4% (56·6-84·6) with trastuzumab andpertuzumab plus metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·65 [95% CI 0·37-1·12], p=0·12). At a median follow-up of 20·7 months (IQR 12·5-30·4), themedian progression-free survival was 5·6 months (95% CI 3·6-16·8) withtrastuzumab and pertuzumab versus 12·7 months (6·7-24·8) with the addition ofmetronomic oral cyclophosphamide. The most frequent grade 3-4 adverse events werehypertension (in six [15%] of 39 patients in the trastuzumab and pertuzumab groupvs five [12%] of 41 in the trastuzumab and pertuzumab plus metronomic oralcyclophosphamide group), diarrhoea (four [10%] vs five [12%]), dyspnoea (two [5%]vs four [10%]), fatigue (three [8%] vs two [5%]), pain (two [5%] vs two [5%]),and a thromboembolic event (0 [0%] vs four [10%]). Severe cardiac toxicities wereoccasionally observed in both groups. In the trastuzumab and pertuzumab groupfour patients died without progression, due to cardiac arrest during treatment(n=1), peritoneal infection (n=1), respiratory failure (n=1), and sudden deathwithout a specified cause (n=1). In the trastuzumab and pertuzumab plusmetronomic oral cyclophosphamide group, one patient died from heart failure.INTERPRETATION: Addition of metronomic oral cyclophosphamide to trastuzumab plus pertuzumab in older and frail patients with HER2-positive metastatic breastcancer increased median progression-free survival by 7 months compared with dual HER2 blockade alone, with an acceptable safety profile. Trastuzumab andpertuzumab plus metronomic oral cyclophosphamide, followed by trastuzumabemtansine after disease progression, might delay or supersede the need for taxanechemotherapy in this population.FUNDING: F Hoffmann-La Roche.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
