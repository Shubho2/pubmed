We used a qualitativeapproach to examine the willingness of older women from different racial/ethnicgroups to discontinue breast cancer screening.METHODS: Women ≥70 years of age who reported having a screening mammogram in the past 3 years and/or reported that they intended to continue screening in thefuture were recruited for in-depth interviews. Participants who intended tocontinue screening were asked to describe how the following hypotheticalscenarios would impact a decision to discontinue screening: health concerns orlimited life expectancy, a physician's recommendation to discontinue, reluctance to undergo treatment, and recommendations from experts or governmental panels to stop screening. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were audio-recorded.Data coding and analysis followed inductive and deductive approaches.RESULTS: Regardless of the scenario, participants (n = 29) expressed a strongintention to continue screening. Based on the hypothetical physicianrecommendations, intentions to continue screening appeared to remain strong. Theydid not envision a change in their health status that would lead them todiscontinue screening and were skeptical of expert/government recommendations.There were no differences observed according to age, race/ethnicity, oreducation.CONCLUSIONS: Among older women who planned to continue screening, intentions tocontinue breast cancer screening appear to be highly resilient and resistant torecommendations from physicians or expert/government panels.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4708 PMCID: PMC5986612 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29575590
