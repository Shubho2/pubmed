[Epub ahead of print]Long-term Accuracy of Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Combining Classic RiskFactors and Breast Density.Brentnall AR(1), Cuzick J(1), Buist DSM(2), Bowles EJA(2).Author information: (1)Centre for Cancer Prevention, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London, London, England.(2)Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle, Washington.Importance: Accurate long-term breast cancer risk assessment for women attending routine screening could help reduce the disease burden andintervention-associated harms by personalizing screening recommendations andpreventive interventions.Objective: To report the accuracy of risk assessment for breast cancer during aperiod of 19 years.Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of the Kaiser PermanenteWashington breast imaging registry included women without previous breast cancer,aged 40 to 73 years, who attended screening from January 1, 1996, throughDecember 31, 2013. Follow-up was completed on December 31, 2014, and data wereanalyzed from March 2, 2016, through November 13, 2017.Exposures: Risk factors from a questionnaire and breast density from the BreastImaging and Reporting Data System at entry; primary risk was assessed using theTyrer-Cuzick model.Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of invasive breast cancer was estimatedwith and without breast density. Follow-up began 6 months after the entrymammogram and extended to the earliest diagnosis of invasive breast cancer,censoring at 75 years of age, 2014, diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ, death,or health plan disenrollment. Observed divided by expected (O/E) numbers ofcancer cases were compared using exact Poisson 95% CIs. Hazard ratios for the topdecile of 10-year risk relative to the middle 80% of the study population wereestimated. Constancy of relative risk calibration during follow-up was testedusing a time-dependent proportional hazards effect.Results: In this cohort study of 132 139 women (median age at entry, 50 years;interquartile range, 44-58 years), 2699 invasive breast cancers were subsequentlydiagnosed after a median 5.2 years of follow-up (interquartile range, 2.4-11.1years; maximum follow-up, 19 years; annual incidence rate [IR] per 1000 women,2.9). Observed number of cancer diagnoses was close to the expected number (O/Efor the Tyrer-Cuzick model, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.98-1.06]; O/E for the Tyrer-Cuzickmodel with density, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.94-1.02]). The Tyrer-Cuzick model estimated2554 women (1.9%) to be at high risk (10-year risk of â‰¥8%), of whom 147subsequently developed invasive breast cancer (O/E, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67-0.93; IRper 1000 women, 8.7). The Tyrer-Cuzick model with density estimated more women tobe at high risk (4645 [3.5%]; 273 cancers [10.1%]; O/E, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.69-0.88; IR per 1000 women, 9.2). The hazard ratio for the highest risk decile comparedwith the middle 80% was 2.22 (95% CI, 2.02-2.45) for the Tyrer-Cuzick model and2.55 (95% CI, 2.33-2.80) for the Tyrer-Cuzick model with density. Little evidencewas found for a decrease in relative risk calibration throughout follow-up forthe Tyrer-Cuzick model (age-adjusted slope, -0.003; 95% CI, -0.018 to 0.012) orthe Tyrer-Cuzick model with density (age-adjusted slope, -0.008; 95% CI, -0.020to 0.004).Conclusions and Relevance: Breast cancer risk assessment combining classic riskfactors with mammographic density may provide useful data for 10 years or moreand could be used to guide long-term, systematic, risk-adapted screening andprevention strategies.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.0174 PMID: 29621362
