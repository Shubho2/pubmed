ER alphapositive breast cancer can be well controlled by ER alpha modulators, such astamoxifen. However, tamoxifen resistance is commonly observed by altered ER alphasignaling. Thus, further understanding of the molecular mechanisms, whichregulates ER alpha signaling, is important to improve breast cancer therapy.METHODS: SMURF1 and ER alpha protein expression levels were measured by westernblot, while the ER alpha target genes were measured by real-time PCR. WST-1 assaywas used to measure cell viability; the xeno-graft tumor model were used for invivo study. RNA sequencing was analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.Identification of ER alpha signaling was accomplished with luciferase assays,real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Protein stability assay and ubiquitinassay was used to detect ER alpha protein degradation. Immuno-precipitation basedassays were used to detect the interaction domain between ER alpha and SMURF1.The ubiquitin-based Immuno-precipitation based assays were used to detect thespecific ubiquitination manner happened on ER alpha.RESULTS: Here, we identify the E3 ligase SMURF1 facilitates ER alpha signaling.We show that depletion SMURF1 decreases ER alpha positive cell proliferation invitro and in vivo. SMURF1 depletion based RNA-sequence data shows SMURF1 isnecessary for ER alpha target gene expression in the transcriptomic scale.Immunoprecipitation indicates that SMURF1 associates with the N-terminal of ERalpha in the cytoplasm via its HECT domain. SMURF1 increases ER alpha stability, possibly by inhibiting K48-specific poly-ubiquitination process on ER alphaprotein. Interestingly, SMURF1 expression could be induced via estradioltreatment.CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a novel positive feedback between SMURF1 and ERalpha signaling in supporting breast cancer growth. Targeting SMURF1 could be onepromising strategy for ER alpha positive breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0672-z PMCID: PMC5808446PMID: 29433542
