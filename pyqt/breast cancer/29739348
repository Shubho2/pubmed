Suchcomprehensive, valid and detailed information on cancer trend is badly needed forplanning a cancer control program in the country.METHODS: All cancer cases were abstracted from patients' medical records - based on clinical, histopathology, and radiological diagnosis. Data were coded usingthe International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) and theInternational Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC-3) to code childhoodtumors. The CanReg4 program was used to analyze the data for 15 years studyperiod.RESULTS: A total of 6974 cases were included in this study, 47% were males and53% females. The overall annual incidence rate was 21.6/100,000 populations;however, the incidence in males was little lower than in females (20.0 and 22.9per 100,000 populations, respectively). The top five cancers among males wereleukaemia (10.5%), nonhodgkin lymphoma [(NHL), 10.1%], colon (7.5%), Hodgkindiseases [(HD), 6.1%] and stomach cancer (5.1%). For females, breast cancer wasthe top (30.0%), followed by leukaemia (7.6%), NHL (6.6%), colonic (4.9%) andovarian cancer (4.5%).CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that, there is urgent need to commence the early screening of breast cancer due to its high frequency among Yemeni women. Thegovernment should give more support for cancer registries in the country tosustain its vital contribution to cancer care.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4411-9 PMCID: PMC5941704PMID: 29739348
