China.Upregulation of microRNA (miR)-10b has been confirmed in multiple types ofcancer, however, the role of miR-10b in glycosylation remains unclear. Proteincore-fucosylation is an important N-linked glycosylation modification and serves important roles in cancer progression. In a previous study, a glycogene array wasapplied to profile the alterations of glycogene expression inmiR-10b-overexpressed MCF10A cells. Notably, fucosyltranferase 8 (FUT8), which isresponsible for the addition of core-fucose to N-glycan, was significantlyupregulated by miR-10b. In the present study, increased motility andproliferation were observed in miR-10b-overexpressed MCF10A cells. To assess the mechanism involved, the role of FUT8 in MCF10A cells was studied and it wasconfirmed that miR-10b promotes motility and proliferation by regulating FUT8 andactivating the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway. Consistent with theaforementioned result, decreased motility and proliferation were detected whenmiR-10b expression was inhibited in MDA-MB-231 cells, transforming growthfactor-Î²-induced and Twist-overexpressed MCF10A cells. To conclude, the findings from the present study indicate that miR-10b promotes motility and proliferation by increasing FUT8 and activating AKT in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8891 PMCID: PMC6036446PMID: 30008906
