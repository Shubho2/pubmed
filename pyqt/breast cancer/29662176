Extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been implicated in theintercellular crosstalk. Here we show a mechanistic model involvingbreast-cancer-secreted, extracellular-vesicle-encapsulated miR-105, which isinduced by the oncoprotein MYC in cancer cells and, in turn, activates MYCsignalling in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to induce a metabolic program.This results in the capacity of CAFs to display different metabolic features inresponse to changes in the metabolic environment. When nutrients are sufficient, miR-105-reprogrammed CAFs enhance glucose and glutamine metabolism to fueladjacent cancer cells. When nutrient levels are low and metabolic by-productsaccumulate, these CAFs detoxify metabolic wastes, including lactic acid andammonium, by converting them into energy-rich metabolites. Thus, themiR-105-mediated metabolic reprogramming of stromal cells contributes tosustained tumour growth by conditioning the shared metabolic environment.DOI: 10.1038/s41556-018-0083-6 PMCID: PMC5920728 [Available on 2018-10-16]PMID: 29662176
