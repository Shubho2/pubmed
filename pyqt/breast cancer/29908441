Electronic address:aforoumadi@tums.ac.ir.A series of new coumarin-containing compounds 3a-l and 4a-c was designed andsynthesized based on the chalcone-type 4-amino-5-cinnamoylthiazole scaffold 2,and screened for their in vitro anticancer and antioxidant activities.Representatively, the 2-thiomorpholinothiazole derivative 3k with IC50 values of 7.5-16.9 μg/ml demonstrated good cytotoxic effects against tested cell linesMCF-7, HepG2 and SW480. Further investigation by flow cytometric analysisconfirmed that this compound induces apoptotic cell death in MCF-7 cells andcause G1-phase arrest in the cell cycle. Moreover, most of compounds hadintrinsic potential for radical scavenging activity and ferric-reducing power as investigated by DPPH and FRAP assays.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
