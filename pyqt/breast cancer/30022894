We are developing a delivery technology for a method previously tested in mousemodels with solid tumors (the Bengston method) independent of the presence of ahealer. The goal of this study was to assess whether stored or recorded energyhas an impact on breast cancer cells in vitro, using energy-charged cotton andelectromagnetic recording of healers practicing the method. Expression of genesinvolved in cancer and inflammation pathways was measured by quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Treatment of cells usingenergy-charged cotton resulted in statistically significant changes <1.5-fold. Incells exposed to an electromagnetic recording, 37 genes of 167 tested showed a>1.5-fold change when compared to the control, and 68 genes showing statisticallysignificant fold changes. Two genes, ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β), were consistently downregulated at 4 and 24 hours of exposure to therecording, respectively, in 3 independent experiments. Both ACLY and IL-1β werealso downregulated in cells exposed to a hands-on delivery of the method,suggesting these 2 genes as potential markers of the healing method.DOI: 10.1177/1559325818782843 PMCID: PMC6047252PMID: 30022894
