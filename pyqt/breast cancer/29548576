However, only a few E1inhibitors have been reported to date. Moreover, there has been little medicinal chemistry research on the three-dimensional structure of E1. Therefore, in thepresent study, we attempted to identify novel E1 inhibitors using structure-baseddrug design. Following the rational design, synthesis, and in vitro biologicalevaluation of several such compounds, we identified a reversible E1 inhibitor(4b). Compound 4b increased p53 levels in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and inhibitedtheir growth. These findings suggest that reversible E1 inhibitors are potential anticancer agents.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2018.03.004 PMID: 29548576
