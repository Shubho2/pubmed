[Epub ahead of print]Highly stable gold nanoparticles green-synthesized by upcycling cartilage wasteextract from yellow-nose skate (Dipturus chilensis) and evaluation of itscytotoxicity, haemocompatibility and antioxidant activity.Ahn EY(1), Lee YJ(1), Choi SY(1), Im AR(2), Kim YS(3), Park Y(1).Author information: (1)a College of Pharmacy and Inje Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences andResearch , Inje University , Gyeongnam , Republic of Korea.(2)b KM Convergence Research Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine ,Yuseong-gu Daejeon , Republic of Korea.(3)c College of Pharmacy and Natural Products Research Institute , Seoul NationalUniversity , Seoul , Republic of Korea.Skate (Dipturus chilensis) cartilage extract was utilized as a green reducingagent for the synthesis of spherical gold nanoparticles with an average size of16.7 ± 0.2 nm. The gold nanoparticle solution showed a surface plasmon resonance at 543 nm with a wine-red colour. A strong X-ray diffraction pattern and clearlattice structure in high-resolution transmission electron microscopy indicated aface-centred cubic structure of the gold nanoparticles. The gold nanoparticlesretained excellent colloidal stability. Gold nanoparticles showed strongantioxidant activity in terms of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavengingactivity. In vitro cytotoxicity was observed for seven cancer cells assessed bythe water-soluble tetrazolium assay. Among the seven cancer cells, the highestcytotoxicity was observed for MDA-MB-231 (human breast adenocarcinoma cell)followed by HeLa (human epithelial cervix adenocarcinoma cell) and lastly byHT-29 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell). Furthermore, gold nanoparticlesshowed excellent haemocompatibility, indicating the possibility of their use as afuture nanomedicine. These results strongly suggest that gold nanoparticlesgreen-synthesized by upcycling skate cartilage waste extract will be valuablecarriers or vehicles for the delivery of drugs or bioactive molecules, such asanti-cancer agents, for the treatment of cancers.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1479710 PMID: 29956560
