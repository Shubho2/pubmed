[Epub ahead of print]Quercetin reversed MDR in breast cancer cells through down-regulating P-gpexpression and eliminating cancer stem cells mediated by YB-1 nucleartranslocation.Li S(1), Zhao Q(2), Wang B(2), Yuan S(2), Wang X(2), Li K(2).Author information: (1)Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of JinzhouMedical University, Jinzhou, Liaoning, 121001, China.(2)Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of JinzhouMedical University, Jinzhou, Liaoning, 121001, China.Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays an important role in mediatingmultidrug resistance (MDR), resulting in chemotherapy failure of tumor patientsand enhancement of cancer stem cell characteristics. By preparing doxorubicin(Dox) resistant human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, here, we wanted to evaluate the effects of quercetin (Que) on MDR reversal activity and investigate its possible mechanism. MCF-7 and MCF-7/dox cells were respectively treated by Dox, paclitaxel(Pac), or vincristine (Vcr) with or without Que intervention for 24 hr. Cellviability, cell apoptosis, cell cycle, intracellular drug accumulation, theexpression of P-gp and Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1), and breast cancer stemcells (BCSCs) were then assessed. The results showed that Que significantlyenhanced the antitumor activities of Dox, Pac, and Vcr in breast cancer cells. Inaddition, combined treatment of Dox, Pac, or Vcr with Que significantlydownregulated P-gp expression and eliminated BCSCs. Furthermore, combinedtreatment of Dox, Pac, or Vcr with Que significantly inhibited nucleartranslocation of YB-1. Thus, we speculated that Que reversed MDR in breast cancercells through downregulating P-gp expression and eliminating cancer stem cellsmediated by YB-1 nuclear translocation.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6081 PMID: 29635751
