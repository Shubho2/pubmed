Recent studies have also indicated that the isolatedexosomes (D/exo) from docetaxel-resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/Doc) wereassociated with resistance transmission by delivering genetic cargo. However, therelevance of D/exo during DRβ-H exposure remains largely unclear. In the present work, exosomes were characterized by morphology and size distribution. Wereinforced the significant role of D/exo in spreading chemoresistance fromMCF-7/Doc to recipient sensitive cells after absorption and internalization.DRβ-H could reduce the formation and release of D/exo. Next, we demonstrated thatDRβ-H was able to reverse docetaxel resistance and that D/exo were responsiblefor DRβ-H-mediated resistance reversal. We also found that DRβ-H could decreasethe expressions of several most abundant microRNAs ( miR-16 , miR-23a , miR-24 , miR-26a , and miR-27a ) transported by D/exo. Target gene prediction and pathway analysis showed the involvement of these selected microRNAs in pathways relatedto treatment failure. Our results suggested that DRβ-H could reduce D/exosecretion from MCF-7/Doc cells and induce the reduction of resistancetransmission via D/exo.©2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20180110 PMID: 30061173
