Methods This prospective studyinvolved 100 patients with suspicious mammography-detected microcalcificationswho underwent image-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsies from January 2013 toOctober 2016. Stereotactic vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (SVAB) was performed in 64 patients, and ultrasound (US)-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (US-VAB)was performed in 36 patients in whom application of SVAB was difficult. Themicrocalcifications were detectable by mammography or US. The mean follow-upduration was 32 months (range, 9-57 months). The biopsy results were correlatedwith the pathological examination results. Results The positive predictive value of microcalcifications detected by mammography and US in the diagnosis of breast cancer was 37.0% (37/100) and 52.8% (19/36), respectively. The negativepredictive value of microcalcifications detected by US in the diagnosis of breastcancer was 71.9% (46/64). No recurrence was observed in the 37 patients withbreast cancer. No evidence of malignancy was found among the 63 patients withbenign lesions. Conclusion Image-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is accurateand minimally invasive. It can be used as a safe approach for diagnosis inpatients with breast microcalcifications.DOI: 10.1177/0300060518770577 PMID: 29772934
