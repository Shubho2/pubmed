Radiology,pathology, and genetic testing reports from outside institutions were comparedwith reports generated after an MTB review and subsequent workup at MUSC. Thesecond-opinion cases were categorized based on whether diagnostic variations werepresent or not.RESULTS: The review included 70 patients seeking second opinions, and 33 (47.1%) of these patients had additional radiologic images. A total of 30 additionalbiopsies were performed for 25 patients, with new cancers identified in 16patients. Overall, 16 (22.8%) of the 70 of patients had additional cancersdiagnosed. For 14 (20%) of the 70 patients, a second opinion led to a change inpathology interpretation. Genetic testing was performed for 11 patients (15.7%)who met the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for genetictesting, but none showed a mutation other than a variant of unknown significance.After a complete workup, 30 (42.8%) of the 70 patients had a change in diagnosis as a result of the MTB review.CONCLUSION: A review by an MTB at an NCI-designated cancer center changed thediagnosis for 43% of the patients who presented for a second opinion for breastcancer. The study findings support the conclusion that referral for a secondopinion is beneficial and has a diagnostic impact for many patients.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6599-y PMID: 29971672
