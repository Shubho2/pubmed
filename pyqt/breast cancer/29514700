This study evaluated the impact of this policy from the patientperspective.METHODS: Surveys were sent to individuals for whom their insurer ordered genetic testing for the cancer susceptibility genes BCRA1 and BRCA2 over a 1 year timeperiod that spanned the introduction of a GC-mandate policy. Responses wereassessed by time period (before/after policy introduction) and genetic testcompletion.RESULTS: The surveys were completed by 1247/4950 (25.7%) eligible individuals.After policy introduction, there was no change in the proportion of respondentswho completed genetic testing (p = 0.13) or had a mutation (p = 0.55). Overalldecisional conflict (uncertainty or feeling uninformed) around genetic testingdid not change after policy introduction (p = 0.16), but was significantly higheramong respondents who did not complete genetic testing (p < 0.01). Although alarger proportion of respondents saw a GC after policy introduction (p < 0.01),fewer did so to better understand their test results (p < 0.01). The proportionof respondents who did not see a GC due to insurance issues/requirements and timerestraints was higher among those tested after policy introduction or who did notcomplete genetic testing (p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, respondents with ahousehold income of $25,000 or greater were 3-times more likely to completetesting.CONCLUSIONS: A GC-mandate policy did not improve decisional conflict or increase the number of deleterious mutations identified and low-income respondents wereless likely to complete testing. On the contrary, insurance requirements and timeconstraints may be preventing individuals at risk from receiving appropriatetesting.DOI: 10.1186/s12913-018-2957-5 PMCID: PMC5842549PMID: 29514700
