China.Renal transplant recipients exhibit an increased risk of developing plasma cellneoplasms (PCNs; comprising multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma); however, multiplemyeloma manifesting with refractory extramedullary plasmacytomas associated with Epstein-Barr virus are markedly rare in these patients. In the present casereport, an unusual case of refractory multiple myeloma with multipleextramedullary plasmacytoma (including liver, vertebrae, breast, muscle, skin andsoft tissues) was presented. The patient exhibited mild bone marrow infiltration which was successfully treated with novel agents, including bortezomib andlenalidomide, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Inaddition, the patient was a renal transplant recipient who achieved a partialclinical remission with controllable therapy-related toxicity effects. Therefore,the present case indicated that ASCT is an effective and safe salvage therapy forrenal transplant recipients with secondary extramedullary plasmacytomas and whoare resistant to traditional chemotherapy (bortezomib and lenalidomide). ASCT waswell-tolerated in the renal transplant recipient.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8237 PMCID: PMC5921225PMID: 29731882
