CH12, a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody, has been developed in our laboratory and selectively binds tooverexpressed EGFR and EGFRvIII. A previous study had reported that EGFR couldinfluence autophagic activity, and autophagy is closely related to tumordevelopment and the response to drug therapy. In this study, we aimed toelucidate the effect of CH12 on autophagy and efficacy of combining CH12 with an autophagy inhibitor against EGFRvIII-positive tumors.METHODS: EGFRvIII was overexpressed in liver cancer, glioblastoma and breastcancer, and the change in the autophagy-relevant protein levels was analyzed bywestern blot assays, LC3 punctate aggregation was analyzed by immunofluorescence.The interaction of Beclin-1 and Rubicon was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation(Co-IP) after CH12 treatment. The efficacy of ATG7 or Beclin-1 siRNA incombination with CH12 in Huh-7-EGFRvIII cells was assessed by CCK-8 assays. Theautophagy and apoptosis signaling events in Huh-7-EGFRvIII cells upon treatmentwith control, CH12, siRNA or combination for 48 h were assessed by western blotassays.RESULTS: Our results showed that, in cancer cell lines overexpressing EGFRvIII,only the liver cancer cell lines Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5 suggested autophagyactivation. We then investigated the mechanism of autophagy activation afterEGFRvIII overexpression. The results showed that EGFRvIII interacted withRubicon, an autophagy inhibition protein, and released Beclin-1 to form theinducer complex, thus contributing to autophagy. In addition, CH12, viainhibiting the phosphorylation of EGFRvIII, promoted the interaction of EGFRvIII with Rubicon, further inducing autophagy. In vitro assays suggested that knockingdown the expression of the key proteins ATG7 or Beclin-1 in the autophagy pathwaywith siRNA inhibits tumor cell proliferation. Combining autophagy-relatedproteins 7 (ATG7) or Beclin-1 siRNA with CH12 in Huh-7-EGFRvIII cells showedbetter inhibition of cell proliferation.CONCLUSION: EGFRvIII could induce autophagy, and CH12 treatment could improveautophagy activity in EGFRvIII-positive liver cancer cells. The combination ofCH12 with an autophagy inhibitor or siRNA against key proteins in the autophagypathway displayed more significant efficacy on EGFRvIII-positive tumor cells thanmonotherapy, and induced cell apoptosis.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
