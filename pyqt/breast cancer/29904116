Here, we examined whether breast cancer cells induce APRIL secretion from neutrophils, which are frequentlyrecruited into the breast tumor microenvironment. We found that breast cancercells do stimulate neutrophils to secrete APRIL through their glycosaminoglycans.Breast cancer cells depleted of heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfateglycosaminoglycans lose their ability to induce APRIL secretion from neutrophils,and heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate can induce secretion that iscomparable to that of breast cancer cell-induced secretion. While stimulation of the RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) is sufficient to induce neutrophil APRILsecretion, both PKR and the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) are required for breastcancer cell glycosaminoglycan-induced secretion as separate and specificinhibition of TLR4 or PKR completely prevents the process, suggesting that breastcancer cell glycosaminoglycans target neutrophil TLR4 and PKR to trigger APRILsecretion. Thus, apart from the putative role of cell surface heparan sulfate in binding APRIL that leads to cell growth, we demonstrate that heparan sulfate, as well as chondroitin sulfate plays a novel role in promoting neutrophil secretion of APRIL that could lead to further cell growth. We propose that breast cancercells take advantage of the neutrophil recruitment to the tumor microenvironment through the dual role of heparan sulfate as cell surface receptor or dockingmolecule for APRIL and as a ligand that induces neutrophil APRIL secretion topromote their own growth.DOI: 10.1038/s41389-018-0058-2 PMCID: PMC6002394PMID: 29904116
