Guideline recommendations werebased on a systematic literature review and created using a predefinedconsensus-building methodology supported by ASTRO-approved tools for gradingevidence quality and recommendation strength.RESULTS: For women with invasive breast cancer receiving WBI with or withoutinclusion of the low axilla, the preferred dose-fractionation scheme ishypofractionated WBI to a dose of 4000 cGy in 15 fractions or 4250 cGy in 16fractions. The guideline discusses factors that might or should affectfractionation decisions. Use of boost should be based on shared decision-makingthat considers patient, tumor, and treatment factors, and the task forcedelineates specific subgroups in which it recommends or suggests use or omission of boost, along with dose recommendations. When planning, the volume of breasttissue receiving >105% of the prescription dose should be minimized and the tumorbed contoured with a goal of coverage with at least 95% of the prescription dose.Dose to the heart, contralateral breast, lung, and other normal tissues should beminimized.CONCLUSIONS: WBI represents a significant portion of radiation oncology practice,and these recommendations are intended to offer the groundwork for definingevidence-based practice for this common and important modality. This guidelinealso seeks to promote appropriately individualized, shared decision-makingregarding WBI between physicians and patients.Copyright Â© 2018 American Society for Radiation Oncology.
