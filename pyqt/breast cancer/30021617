Pericardial drainage procedures are oftenrequested for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The perceived benefit is that it allows for diagnosis of malignancy or infection for patients with PEs of unclear etiology. The purpose of the study is to determine the diagnostic yieldof surgical drainage procedures.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who underwentsurgical drainage procedures of PEs from July 1st, 2011 to January 1st, 2017 at asingle institution. The variables included data on preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative findings; morbidity; and survival.RESULTS: A total of 145 patients with an average age of 61 ± 5 and primarily men (53%) were evaluated. All of the surgical drainage procedures were performedthrough the sub-xiphoid approach. Twenty-five of the 145 patients (17.2%) haddiagnostic findings in either the pericardial tissue or fluid. The cytology alonewas diagnostic in 4.8% (N = 7) of patients with mixed findings includingadenocarcinoma of the lung and breast. The pathology was diagnostic for cancer in1.4% (N = 2) of patients with Melanoma and Lung cancer identified. The cytologyand pathology were concordant in 4.0% (N = 6) identifying cancers that includedmesothelioma and adenocarcinoma. Infection was identified in the pericardialfluid in 6.9% (N = 10) of the patients.CONCLUSION: Surgical pericardial drainage procedures allow for removal of PE thatmay lead to tamponade physiology and potential mortality. Although there istherapeutic benefit from these procedures there is only a small diagnosticbenefit.DOI: 10.1186/s13019-018-0774-x PMCID: PMC6052520PMID: 30021617
