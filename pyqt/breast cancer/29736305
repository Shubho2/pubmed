The activation of gene expression by small activating RNA hasexcellent targeting specificity and flexibility, with a persistent and strongeffect. Studies have shown that the RNAa technique has broad prospects forapplication in the research on tumor pathogenesis and the treatment of tumors.This paper reviews the literature on RNAa with regard to the course of discovery,the mechanisms and characteristics of action, and the current status andprospects of application.PMCID: PMC5934550PMID: 29736305
