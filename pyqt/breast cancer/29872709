Becausetriple-negative breast cancer express low or are devoid of estrogen,progesterone, or Her2/Neu receptors, another target must be used for advanceddrug delivery strategies. Here, we engineered a nanodrug delivery systemconsisting of silver-coated gold nanorods (AuNR/Ag) targeting epithelial celladhesion/activating molecule (EpCAM) and loaded with doxorubicin. This nanodrugsystem, AuNR/Ag/Dox-EpCAM, was found to specifically target EpCAM-expressingtumors compared to low EpCAM-expressing tumors. Namely, the nanodrug had aneffective dose (ED50) of 3 μM in inhibiting 4T1 cell viability and an ED50 of110 μM for MDA-MD-231 cells. Flow cytometry data indicated that 4T1 cells, onaverage, express two orders of magnitude more EpCAM than MDA-MD-231 cells, which correlates with our ED50 findings. Moreover, due to the silver coating, theAuNR/Ag can be detected simultaneously by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy andphotoacoustic microscopy. Analysis by these imaging detection techniques as well as by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry showed that the targetednanodrug system was taken up by EpCAM-expressing cells and tumors atsignificantly higher rates than untargeted nanoparticles (p < 0.05). Thus, thisapproach establishes a plasmonically active nanodrug theranostic fortriple-negative breast cancer and, potentially, a delivery platform with improvedmultimodal imaging capability for other clinically relevant chemotherapeuticswith dose-limiting toxicities, such as platinum-based or taxane-based therapies.DOI: 10.1038/s41698-017-0030-1 PMCID: PMC5871908PMID: 29872709
