[Epub ahead of print]A fine-needle aspiration-based protein signature discriminates benign frommalignant breast lesions.Franzén B(1), Kamali-Moghaddam M(2), Alexeyenko A(3)(4), Hatschek T(1), BeckerS(3)(4), Wik L(2), Kierkegaard J(5)(6), Eriksson A(7), Muppani NR(2), Auer G(1), Landegren U(2), Lewensohn R(1).Author information: (1)Department of Oncology and Pathology, Cancer Center Karolinska, KarolinskaInstitutet and University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.(2)Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory,Uppsala University, Sweden.(3)Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology (MTC), KarolinskaInstitutet, Stockholm, Sweden.(4)National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden, Science for Life Laboratory,Solna, Sweden.(5)BröstCentrum City, Stockholm, Sweden.(6)Capio S:t Görans Sjukhus, Stockholm, Sweden.(7)KIGene, MMK, Neurogenetics Unit, CMM, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,Sweden.There are increasing demands for informative cancer biomarkers, accessible viaminimally invasive procedures, both for initial diagnostics and to follow-uppersonalized cancer therapy. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy provides readyaccess to relevant tissues; however, the minute sample amounts require sensitive multiplex molecular analysis to achieve clinical utility. We have appliedproximity extension assays (PEA) and NanoString (NS) technology for analyses ofproteins and of RNA, respectively, in FNA samples. Using samples from patientswith breast cancer (BC, n = 25) or benign lesions (n = 33), we demonstrate thatthese FNA-based molecular analyses (a) can offer high sensitivity andreproducibility, (b) may provide correct diagnosis in shorter time and at a lowercost than current practice, (c) correlate with results from routine analysis(i.e., benchmarking against immunohistochemistry tests for ER, PR, HER2, andKi67), and (d) may also help identify new markers related to immunotherapy. Aspecific 11-protein signature, including FGF binding protein 1, decorin, andfurin, distinguished all cancer patient samples from all benign lesions in ourmain cohort and in smaller replication cohort. Due to the minimally traumaticsampling and rich molecular information, this combined proteomics andtranscriptomic methodology is promising for diagnostics and evaluation oftreatment efficacy in BC.© 2018 The Authors.
