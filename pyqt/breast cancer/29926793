The Cancer Expert Working Group on CancerPrevention and Screening (CEWG) was set up in 2002 by the Cancer CoordinatingCommittee to review and assess local and international scientific evidence, andto formulate recommendations for cancer prevention and screening. Afterconsidering the local epidemiology, emerging scientific evidence, and local andoverseas screening practices, the CEWG concluded that it was unclear whetherpopulation-based breast cancer screening did more harm than good in localasymptomatic women at average risk. The CEWG considers that there is insufficientevidence to recommend for or against population-based mammography screening forsuch individuals. Women who consider breast cancer screening should be adequatelyinformed about the benefits and harms. The CEWG recommends that all women adoptprimary preventive measures, be breast aware, and seek timely medical attentionfor suspicious symptoms. For women at high risk of breast cancer, such ascarriers of confirmed BRCA1/2 deleterious mutations and those with a familyhistory of breast cancer, the CEWG recommends that they seek doctor's advice for annual mammography screening and the age at which the process should commence.Additional annual screening by magnetic resonance imaging is recommended forconfirmed BRCA1/2 mutation carriers or women who have undergone radiation therapyto the chest between the age of 10 and 30 years. Women at moderate risk of breastcancer should discuss with doctors the pros and cons of breast cancer screeningbefore making an informed decision about mammography screening every 2 to 3years.PMID: 29926793
