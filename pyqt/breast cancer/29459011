Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) induce both angiogenesis andlymphangiogenesis in mouse breast cancer models and positively correlate withthese processes in human breast cancer patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)is a widely used therapeutic option for cancer treatment. However, the effect of NAC on the distribution of TAM within intratumoral compartments and theircorrelation with angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis remained unknown. In thepresent study we analyzed the effect of NAC on the distribution of CD68+ andstabilin-1+ TAM in five functionally distinct areas of human breast cancer andtheir correlations with microvessel density (MVD) and lymphatic microvesseldensity (LMVD), identified by CD31 and LYVE1, respectively. We found that NACenhances blood vessel density in soft fibrous stroma and in coarse fibrousstroma. Without NAC the amount of CD68+ TAM in gaps of ductal tumor structurespositively correlate with CD31+ microvessel density in soft fibrous stroma. NAChad enhancing effect on the amount of CD68+ TAM but not stabilin-1+ TAM in softfibrous stroma. However, no correlation between TAM and CD31+ microvessel densitywas identified after NAC. NAC did not enhance the lymphatic microvessel density. But after NAC stabilin-1 expressing subpopulation of TAM positively correlatedwith expression of LYVE-1. We hypothesized that CD68+ TAM can support tumorangiogenesis primarily before NAC, while stabilin-1+ TAM can contribute to themaintenance of lymphatic microvessel density after NAC.Copyright © 2017.
