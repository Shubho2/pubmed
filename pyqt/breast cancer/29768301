Patient DNA samples were genotyped with the Illumina OmniExpress BeadChip. Replication was attempted with genotyping datafrom 1398 HER2-negative patients entered on the GeparQuinto NAC study in whichpatients were also randomized to receive, or not, bevacizumab in addition tochemotherapy. A total of 920 women from B-40 were analyzed, and 237 patientsachieved a pCR. GWAS with three phenotypes (pCR, disease-free survival, overallsurvival) revealed no single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that weregenome-wide significant (i.e. Pâ‰¤5E-08) signals; P values for top SNPs were2.04E-07, 5.61E-08, and 5.63E-08, respectively, and these SNPs were notsignificant in the GeparQuinto data. An ad-hoc GWAS was performed in the patientsrandomized to bevacizumab (457 patients with 128 pCR) who showed signals onchromosome 6, located within a gene, CDKAL1, that approached, but did not reach, genome-wide significance (top SNP rs7453577, P=2.97E-07). However, this findingwas significant when tested in the GeparQuinto data set (P=0.04). In conclusion, we identified no SNPs significantly associated with NAC. The observation, in ahypothesis-generating GWAS, of an SNP in CDKAL1 associated with pCR in thebevacizumab arm of both B-40 and GeparQuinto requires further validation andstudy.DOI: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000337 PMCID: PMC5965682 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29768301
