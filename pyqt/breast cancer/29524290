One-way analysis of variance was performed tocompare differences, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: Homogeneity index of plan III is lower than those of plans I and II. No difference was identified in conformity index of targets. Plan I exhibiteddifference in mean dose (Dmean ) for the heart (P < 0.05). Plan I featuredsmaller irradiation dose volumes in V5 , V20 (P < 0.05) of the left lung than II.Plan I exhibited significantly higher V5 in the right lung than plans II and III (P < 0.05). Under plan I, irradiation dose at V5 in the right breast is higherthan that in plans II and III. Patients in plan III presented less total monitor unit and total treatment time than those in plans I and II (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: IMRT six-field plans II, and field-in-field-direct machine parameter optimization-IMRT plans III can reduce doses and volumes to the lungs and heartbetter while maintaining satisfying conformity index and homogeneity index oftarget. Nevertheless, plan II neglects target movements caused by respiration. Inthe same manner, plan III can substantially reduce MU and shorten patienttreatment time. Therefore, plan III, which considers target movement caused byrespiration, is a more practical radiation mode.© 2018 The Authors.
