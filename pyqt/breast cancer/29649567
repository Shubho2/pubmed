However, autophagy itself causesmetabolic stress to cells, and other cellular protective mechanisms likelycooperate with autophagy to promote cell survival during nutrient deprivation. Inthis study, we explored protective mechanisms in breast cancer cells in thesetting of glucose deprivation. While breast cancer cells (MCF7 and T47D) survivein glucose-free medium for three days or more, autophagy is induced in thissetting. Blocking autophagy pharmacologically with chloroquine or by knock-out ofan essential autophagy gene, such as Beclin 1 or ATG7, markedly reduces theability of cells to survive during glucose deprivation. Autophagy previously was shown to degrade p62, a protein that sequesters KEAP1, and KEAP1 in turnsequesters Nrf2, a master regulator of the antioxidant response. Hence, weinvestigated how the Nrf2 signaling pathway might be affected by glucosedeprivation and autophagy. We found that while glucose deprivation does causedecreased cellular levels of p62, Nrf2 protein levels and activity unexpectedlyincrease in this setting. Moreover, this increase in Nrf2 activity providesimportant protection to breast cancer cells during glucose deprivation, sincesiRNA knockdown of Nrf2 markedly impairs survival during glucose deprivation.Antioxidants, N-acetyl cysteine and glutathione also protect these cells duringglucose deprivation, leading us to conclude that Nrf2 signaling via itsantioxidant activity has a critical and previously undescribed role of protectingcells during glucose deprivation-induced autophagy.Copyright © 2018.
