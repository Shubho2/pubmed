Comprehensive medicalrecord review was performed to identify the clinical presentation, representativeneuroimaging, histopathologic features, and response to treatment.RESULTS: Patient 1 presented 1 month into induction therapy of malignant vaginal squamous cell carcinoma (stage 3, T2N1M0) with acute episodic left-sidedhemiparesis due to seizure activity progressing to severe encephalopathy. Imagingrevealed a right frontoparietal lesion while systemic workup was unrevealing.Biopsy demonstrated necrotizing vasculitis. Patient 2 presented 6 months afterdiagnosis of right breast invasive ductal carcinoma (stage IIa, T2N0M0, estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive) with subacute bifrontal headaches with associatedphonophobia. Imaging showed hyperintense lesions involving the righttemporoparietal region and systemic workup was unrevealing. Brain biopsy showed anecrotizing vasculitis. Patient 1 was treated with methyprednisolone andplasmapheresis and patient 2 was treated with prednisone. Both patients showedcomplete resolution of symptoms shortly after treatment and improvement onimaging.CONCLUSIONS: These cases highlight the importance of comprehensive evaluation of new brain lesions in patients with nonmetastatic solid tumors. Characteristics ofnew brain lesions in patients with cancer that should raise suspicion ofdiagnoses other than brain metastasis include (1) primary malignancy withoutregional or distant metastasis, (2) imaging without discrete mass-likeenhancement, and (3) cortically based location of lesions not at the gray-whitematter junction.Â© 2018 American Academy of Neurology.DOI: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005350 PMID: 29686118
