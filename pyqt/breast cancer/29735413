It is unclearhowever, which type of alteration may be more informative of cancer risk. Weanalyzed genome-wide DNA methylation and copy-number calls from the same DNAassay in a cohort of healthy breast samples and age-matched normal samplescollected adjacent to breast cancer. Using statistical methods to adjust for celltype heterogeneity, we show that DNA methylation changes can discriminatenormal-adjacent from normal samples better than somatic copy-number variants. We validate this important finding in an independent dataset. These results suggest that DNA methylation alterations in the normal cell of origin may offer bettercancer risk prediction and early detection markers than copy-number changes.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
