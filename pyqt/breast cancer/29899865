The IC50 valuesfor OA-induced cytotoxicity were 112.57 in DU145, 132.29 in MCF-7, and 163.60 in U87 cells, respectively. OA did not exhibit toxicity in BNL CL. 2 and Hs 68 cell lines in our experiments. OA, at 100 Âµg/mL, increased the number of apoptoticcells to 27.0% in DU145, 27.0% in MCF-7, and 15.7% in U87, when compared tocontrol cells. This enhanced apoptosis was due to increases in p53, cytochrome c,Bax, PARP-1 and caspase-3 expression in DU145, MCF-7 and U87 cell lines.OA-treated DU145 cells were arrested in G2 because of the activation of p-AKT,p-JNK, p21 and p27, and the decrease in p-ERK, cyclin B1 and CDK2 expression;OA-treated MCF-7 cells were arrested in G1 owing to the activation of p-JNK,p-ERK, p21, and p27, and the decrease in p-AKT, cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, andCDK2; and OA-treated U87 cells also exhibited G1 phase arrest caused by theincrease in p-ERK, p-JNK, p-AKT, p21, and p27, and the decrease in cyclin D1,CDK4, cyclin E and CDK2. Thus, OA arrested the cell cycle at different phases andinduced apoptosis in cancer cells. These results suggested that OA possiblyaltered the expression of the cell cycle regulatory proteins differently invarying types of cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25316 PMCID: PMC5995180PMID: 29899865
