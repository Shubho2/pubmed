Brazil.BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and particularlyselective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors such as celecoxib (Cxb) areconsidered promising cancer chemopreventive for colon, breast, prostate, lung,and skin cancers. However, the clinical application to the prevention is limited by concerns about safety, potential to serious toxicity (mainly for healthyindividuals), efficacy and optimal treatment regimen. Cxb exhibits advantages as potent anti-inflammatory and gastrointestinal tolerance compared withconventional NSAID's. Recent researches suggest that dermatological formulations of Cxb are more suitable than oral administration in treatment of cutaneousdisease, including skin cancer. To date optimism has been growing regarding theexploration of the topical application of Cxb (in the prevention of skin cancers and treatment of cutaneous inflammation) or transdermal route reducing risks ofsystemic side effects.OBJECTIVE: This paper briefly summarizes our current knowledge of the developmentof the cutaneous formulations or delivery systems for Cxb as anti-inflammatorydrug (for topical or transdermal application) as well its chemopreventiveproperties focused on skin cancer.CONCLUSION: new perspectives emerge from the growing knowledge, bringinginnovative techniques combining the action of Cxb with other substances or agentswhich act in a different way, but complementary, increasing the efficacy andminimizing toxicity.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1568009618666180430125201 PMID: 29714143
