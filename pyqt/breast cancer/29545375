Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science, JohnsHopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland srowe8@jhmi.edu.Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II transmembrane glycoproteinthat is highly overexpressed on prostate cancer epithelial cells and for whichthere is a growing body of literature examining the role of small-molecule andantibody radiotracers targeted against this protein for prostate cancer detectionand therapy. Despite its name, PSMA is also expressed, to varying degrees, in theneovasculature of a wide variety of nonprostate cancers; indeed, the pathologyliterature is replete with promising immunohistochemistry findings. Severalgroups have begun to correlate those pathology-level results with in vivo imagingand therapy in nonprostate cancers using the same PSMA-targeted agents that have been so successful in prostate cancer. The potential to leverage radiotracerstargeted to PSMA beyond prostate cancer is a promising approach for many cancers,and PSMA-targeted agents may be able to supplement or fill gaps left by otheragents. However, to date, most of the reported findings with PSMA-targetedradiotracers in nonprostate malignancies have been in case reports and small caseseries, and the field must adopt a more thorough approach to the design andexecution of larger prospective trials to realize the potential of thesepromising agents outside prostate cancer.Â© 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.117.203570 PMID: 29545375
