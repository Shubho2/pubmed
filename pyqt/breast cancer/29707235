Biological networks are known to be highlymodular and contain dense "communities" of genes that carry out cellularprocesses, but these structures change between tissues, during development, andin disease. While many methods exist for inferring networks and analyzing theirtopologies separately, there is a lack of robust methods for quantifyingdifferences in network structure. Here, we describe ALPACA (ALtered PartitionsAcross Community Architectures), a method for comparing two genome-scale networksderived from different phenotypic states to identify condition-specific modules. In simulations, ALPACA leads to more nuanced, sensitive, and robust modulediscovery than currently available network comparison methods. As an application,we use ALPACA to compare transcriptional networks in three contexts: angiogenicand non-angiogenic subtypes of ovarian cancer, human fibroblasts expressingtransforming viral oncogenes, and sexual dimorphism in human breast tissue. Ineach case, ALPACA identifies modules enriched for processes relevant to thephenotype. For example, modules specific to angiogenic ovarian tumors areenriched for genes associated with blood vessel development, and modules found infemale breast tissue are enriched for genes involved in estrogen receptor and ERKsignaling. The functional relevance of these new modules suggests that not onlycan ALPACA identify structural changes in complex networks, but also that thesechanges may be relevant for characterizing biological phenotypes.DOI: 10.1038/s41540-018-0052-5 PMCID: PMC5908977PMID: 29707235
