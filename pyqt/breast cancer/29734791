Since the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases involves inflammatoryand oxidative components, oleocanthal is a promising agent to prevent theseconditions. This review aimed to summarise the current beneficial health effects of oleocanthal and the molecular basis of its biological actions. Theanti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antimicrobial, anticancer and neuroprotectiveactivities of oleocanthal have been examined by previous studies. Of these,studies on the anticancer effects have been the most extensive. Oleocanthal wasreported to suppress melanoma, breast, liver, and colon cancer cells.Neurological studies focused on the effects of oleocanthal againstAlzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Oleocanthal improved clearance of the amyloid betaprotein from neurons and reduced the inflammation of astrocytes. Despite thepositive results, validation of the biological effects of oleocanthal in animaldisease models is limited and should be emphasized in the future. As aconclusion, oleocanthal may act together with other bioactive compounds in olive oil to achieve its therapeutic potential. The use of oleocanthal alone as asingle therapeutic measure awaits validation from future studies.DOI: 10.3390/nu10050570 PMCID: PMC5986450PMID: 29734791
