Electronic address: j.tol@vumc.nl.PURPOSE: Breast cancer patients who require locoregional lymph node (LLN)irradiation can be treated using a hybrid RapidArc technique combining 2tangential and 3 RapidArc fields. Because the creation of hybrid RapidArc plansis complex and labor-intensive, we developed an automated treatment planningworkflow using the scripting application programming interface of the Eclipsetreatment planning system.METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifteen patients (5 right- and 10 left-sided) previouslytreated with breast + LLN radiation therapy were replanned using the script. The automated workflow included1 optimal placement of the tangential fields based on the planning target volume and organ-at-risk contours, followed by optimizationof field weights and beam energy2; positioning of the RapidArc fields; and3subsequent RapidArc optimization using the RapidPlan knowledge-based planningsolution.RESULTS: Average total planning times were 163 ± 97 and 33 ± 5 minutes for themanual and automated plans, respectively, with approximately 130 and 5 minutes ofuser interaction. Dosimetrically, both sets of plans were very similar, withcomparable planning target volume dose homogeneity values and organ-at-risk mean dose differences of ≤1.9 Gy. In 14/15 patients, the physician judged that theautomated plan was either preferred (n = 4) or equal (n = 10) to the manual plan.CONCLUSIONS: The complex hybrid RapidArc planning process for patients requiring breast + LLN irradiation was automated by optimizing the tangential field setupand integrating RapidPlan. The quality of the automated and manual plans wascomparable, whereas automated planning times were substantially shorter. Theprinciples described here could be used to automate other planning workflows.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.prro.2018.03.008 PMID: 29907505
