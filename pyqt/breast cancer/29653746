The success of conventional treatmentmay be ameliorated by elevating the responsiveness of the cancer cells to CRT.NVP-BEZ235 as a PI3K/AKT/mTOR dual inhibitor has been shown promising results in treating breast cancer cells. However, potential radiation-sensitizing effect of NVP-BEZ235 in TNBC remained unclear. In addition, SIRT-1 activation state andenvironmental cytokine were identified as being responsible for cancer cellsresponses to CRT. Herein, we investigate the role of interleukin 6 (IL-6) as atumor environmental cytokine and SIRT1 in the effectiveness of NVP-BEZ235 plusradiotherapy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: TNBC cells were pre-treated with/without IL-6 and wereexposed to single and combination of SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator)/EX-527 (SIRT1inhibitor) and/or NVP-BEZ235 and/or gamma radiation. The effect of our treatmentson cellular growth was determined by MTT and the cellular death and CSCspercentage were determined by Flow cytometry. Senescence detection kit was usedto assay the effect of our treatments on cellular senescence induction.RESULTS: Activation of SIRT1 via SRT1720 increased the efficacy of CRT in TNBCcells, especially when IL-6 exists in tumor microenvironment. Additionally, IL-6 pre-treatment followed by exposure to SRT1720 and NVP-BEZ235 significantlyincreased sensitivity of the cancer stem cells to radiation (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Our result shows that combination of NVP-BEZ235 and SRT1720 mayeffectively improve late stage breast cancer cells therapeutics approach.Activation of SIRT1 and STAT3 in resistance breast cancer cells improves thein-vitro therapeutic efficacy of CRT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
