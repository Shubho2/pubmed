A total of 42 breathing traces from seven lung and breast cancer patients and corresponding fluoroscopy movies under FB, standard breath hold (stBH) and representativebreath hold (reBH) guidance maneuvers were analyzed. Diaphragm motions weremeasured manually on a frame-by-frame basis. Mean absolute deviation (MAD) valuesof the measured external motion curves were calculated for the FB and guidancemaneuvers, and the internal/external motion consistencies were compared with alinear fit. Compared with FB, the MAD values were reduced significantly withrespiratory guidance maneuvers. The mean internal/external correlations of thefirst treatment fraction were determined to be 0.96 ± 0.03, 0.97 ± 0.02, and0.97 ± 0.03 for the FB, stBH and reBH guidance maneuvers, respectively, and were 0.95 ± 0.03, 0.97 ± 0.03, and 0.98 ± 0.02 for the second treatment fraction. Nophase shift between the two breathing signals was observed, and goodreproducibility of consistency of breathing guidance between the two fractionswas achieved. These results demonstrated that treatment precision could beimproved for cancer patients with audio-visual BFB, and a strong correlationbetween diaphragm motion and abdominal wall motion was obtained. The use ofaudio-visual BFB improved the regularity of both internal and external motions,allowing confident use of the audio-visual BFB method by tracking of the externalabdominal wall motion to synchrotron-based heavy-ion radiotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s13246-018-0667-2 PMID: 30039306
