Correlates and determinants of compliance withendocrine therapy among Chinese patients with breast cancer are not known. Theaim of this study was to elucidate the efficacy and adherence of endocrinetherapy in China and suggest effective improvements on the adherence.Patients and methods: We analyzed the survival of 1,110 patients eligible forendocrine therapy and adherence of 699 patients to endocrine therapy.Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate survival, and logistic regression models were used to assessvariables associated with treatment adherence.Results: Long-term endocrine therapy was associated with lower recurrence rate(HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.56-0.93; p=0.013). Adherence to endocrine therapy was only63.1%. Sociodemographic characteristics of patients, clinical- andmedication-related characteristics and patients' attitudes were associated withadherence to endocrine therapy.Conclusion: Adherence to endocrine therapy in Chinese patients with ER+/PR+breast cancer was <65%. Both patients and physicians should take progressivesteps to improve the rate of adherence.DOI: 10.2147/PPA.S167004 PMCID: PMC5973402PMID: 29872274
