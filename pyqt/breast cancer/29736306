R. China.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in womenworldwide. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an effective antibody drug for HER2positive breast cancer; de novo or acquired trastuzumab resistance retarded theuse of trastuzumab for at least 70% of HER2 positive breast cancers. In thisstudy, we reported LMO4 (a member of LIM-only proteins) promoted trastuzumabresistance in human breast cancer cells. Over-expression of LMO4 was observed in acquired trastuzumab resistance breast cancer cells SKBR3 HR and BT474 HR.Depletion of LMO4 partly abolished the trastuzumab resistance of SKBR3 HR andBT474 HR cells. Forced expression of LMO4 significantly increased trastuzumabresistance of HER2 positive breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. BCL-2 was regulated by LMO4 and mediated the promoting role of LMO4 in trastuzumabresistance of HER2 positive breast cancer cells. High level of LMO4 wasassociated with worse clinicopathological parameters (including tumor size andhistological grade) and lower survival rate in HER2 positive breast cancerpatients. LMO4 therefore could be used as a target to develop diagnostic andtherapeutic methods for human HER2 positive breast cancer.PMCID: PMC5934551PMID: 29736306
