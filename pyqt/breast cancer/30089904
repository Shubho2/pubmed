Although cell linesare known to evolve in culture, the extent of the resultant genetic andtranscriptional heterogeneity and its functional consequences remainunderstudied. Here we use genomic analyses of 106 human cell lines grown in twolaboratories to show extensive clonal diversity. Further comprehensive genomiccharacterization of 27 strains of the common breast cancer cell line MCF7uncovered rapid genetic diversification. Similar results were obtained withmultiple strains of 13 additional cell lines. Notably, genetic changes wereassociated with differential activation of gene expression programs and markeddifferences in cell morphology and proliferation. Barcoding experiments showedthat cell line evolution occurs as a result of positive clonal selection that is highly sensitive to culture conditions. Analyses of single-cell-derived clonesdemonstrated that continuous instability quickly translates into heterogeneity ofthe cell line. When the 27 MCF7 strains were tested against 321 anti-cancercompounds, we uncovered considerably different drug responses: at least 75% ofcompounds that strongly inhibited some strains were completely inactive inothers. This study documents the extent, origins and consequences of geneticvariation within cell lines, and provides a framework for researchers to measure such variation in efforts to support maximally reproducible cancer research.DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0409-3 PMID: 30089904
