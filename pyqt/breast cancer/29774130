While researchers have identified treatments that shrink or slowmetastatic tumors, no treatment that permanently eradicates metastasis exists at present. Here, we show that the ABL kinase inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib, andGNF-5 impede invadopodium precursor formation and cortactin-phosphorylationdependent invadopodium maturation, leading to decreased actin polymerization ininvadopodia, reduced extracellular matrix degradation, and impaired matrixproteolysis-dependent invasion. Using a mouse xenograft model we demonstratethat, while primary tumor size is not affected by ABL kinase inhibitors, the invivo matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, tumor cell invasion, and consequentspontaneous metastasis to lungs are significantly impaired in inhibitor-treatedmice. Further proteogenomic analysis of breast cancer patient databases revealed co-expression of the Abl-related gene (Arg) and cortactin across all hormone- andhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-receptor status tumors, whichcorrelates synergistically with distant metastasis and poor patient prognosis.Our findings establish a prognostic value for Arg and cortactin as predictors of metastatic dissemination and suggest that therapeutic inhibition of ABL kinasesmay be used for blocking breast cancer metastasis.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25243 PMCID: PMC5955141PMID: 29774130
