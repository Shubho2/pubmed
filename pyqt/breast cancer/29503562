Most studies focus on skin appearancesand treatment of such reactions, not the experience. Increased knowledge aboutpatients' experience will contribute to provide tailored patient care. Thus, the purpose was to investigate patients' experiences of acute skin toxicity followingradiation therapy for breast cancer.Patients and methods: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted withseven women, 2-3 weeks post-treatment. Five broad areas of inquiry wereinvestigated: 1) experiences from the development of skin reactions; 2)experiences in day-to-day life; 3) coping strategies; 4) experiences ofinformation; and 5) experiences from the aftercare. The interviews were analyzed in line with qualitative content analysis.Results: The main theme "Not so bad itself, but it comes on top of everythingelse" was identified, based upon three categories: 1) unique experience of theskin; 2) it is something about the psychological aspect; and 3) experience ofinformation.Conclusion: Acute skin toxicity following breast cancer treatment may affect manydimensions of patients' lives. Experiences are complex, individual, and notnecessarily consistent with visible changes of the skin. A holistic approach isnecessary to provide treatment and support according to patients' individualneeds.DOI: 10.2147/JMDH.S155538 PMCID: PMC5826296PMID: 29503562
