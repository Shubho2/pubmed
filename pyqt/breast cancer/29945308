The aim of this study is to investigate the role ofmiR-142-3p in breast cancer cells and the related mechanism.METHODS: Sixty paired breast cancer tissues were collected and 60 breast tissues from patients with mammary hyperplasia served as the control group. Theexpression of miR-142-3p was examined using RT-qPCR methods; moreover, we alsoperformed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to determinewhether miR142-3p can distinguish breast cancer patients from the controls. Next,HMGA1 and FZD7 have been predicted as target genes of miR-142-3p, and theexpressions of HMGA1 and FZD7 in breast cancer tissue and the control group were examined using RT-qPCR and western blot methods.RESULTS: miR-142-3p was significantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissuecompared with the controls, and the levels of miR-142-3p was negativelycorrelated with the tumor size, degree of differentiation, and metastasis (p <0.01). Moreover, results of ROC curve analysis indicated that the expression ofmiR-142-3p can distinguish between patients with breast cancer and the controlgroup (AUC = 0.819, 95% CI, 0.756 - 0.881). Furthermore, the expressions of HMGA1and FZD7 were significantly up-regulated in patients with breast cancer compared with the controls. The level of miR-142-3p was negatively correlated withexpressions of HMGA1 (r = -0.3507, p = 0.006) and FZD7 (r = -0.3410, p = 0.0077) in patients with breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Our results proved that miR-142-3p may serve as a tumor suppressorin breast cancer by suppressing the expression of oncogene HMGA1 and FZD7,suggesting that miR-142-3p has the potential to become a diagnostic marker andtherapeutic target for the early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.PMID: 29945308
