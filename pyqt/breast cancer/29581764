However, little is known about the relationship between the NLR and patients with tumours who receiveneoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in terms of response rate and prognostic ability. We thus performed this meta-analysis to further investigate this relationship.Methods: An electronic systematic literature search for articles published beforeSeptember 2017 was performed to explore the association between the pretreatment NLR and outcome in patients treated with NAC. Data were extracted by the reportedodds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95% confidence intervals(CIs) for the response rate and the survival outcome, respectively. The resultswere pooled using the random-effect or fixed-effect model. Results: Thirty-three studies were eventually included in our study, and all were published no earlier than 2011. An NLR that was higher than the cut-off was associated with a lowerpathological complete response (pCR) rate in patients with cancer (OR = 1.72, 95%CI, 1.26-2.33). A lower NLR was associated with better overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.58, 95% CI, 1.34-1.86), cancer-specific survival (CSS) (HR = 2.22, 95% CI,1.32-3.74), disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 1.32, 95% CI, 1.10-1.59) andrecurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR = 1.90, 95% CI, 1.50-2.40). Conclusion:Overall, an NLR lower than the cut-off value indicated a greater chance for pCRand may predict good survival outcomes after NAC for patients with solid tumours.The use of the NLR for risk stratification before NAC should be furtherdemonstrated by future large-scale prospective studies.DOI: 10.7150/jca.23367 PMCID: PMC5868150PMID: 29581764
