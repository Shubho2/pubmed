We used the DiviTum™ assay to analyze TK1 activity in cell lysates of threeHR+/HER2neg BC cell lines and in plasma of 31 HR+/HER2neg MBC patients receiving ET. Blood samples were collected at treatment initiation, after one month and at disease progression. CTCs count and ESR1/PIK3CA mutations in circulating tumorDNA were performed and correlated with TK1 activity. TK1 activity was reduced in the two endocrine-sensitive cell lines after 2 days of treatment. In patients,high baseline TK1 activity correlated with CTCs positivity (p-value=0.014).Patients with low baseline levels of TK1 activity had a significantly better PFS compared to those with high baseline TK1 activity (p-value=0.012). Patients with an early drop of TK1 activity after one month of treatment had a significantlybetter PFS compared to those who experienced an increase (p-value=0.0026). Ourstudy suggests that TK1 could be a potential prognostic, predictive andmonitoring marker of early ET response in HR+/HER2neg MBC patients.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24700 PMCID: PMC5893248PMID: 29662653
