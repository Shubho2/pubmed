Compounds with phenylindole scaffold werefound to execute promising cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell line MCF7. In the present study, a Monte Carlo based QSAR analysis was performed on a datasetcontaining 102 phenylindoles in order to accelerate the efforts to find outbetter cytotoxic phenylindoles against MCF7 cell line. The statistical qualities of the generated models were found to be quite good as far as the internal andexternal validation were concerned. The best models from each split (Split 1:R2 = 0.6944, Q2 = 0.6495; Split 2: R2 = 0.8202, Q2 = 0.7998; Split 3:R2 = 0.8603, Q2 = 0.8357) for the test set were selected and Y-scrambling testand applicability domain analysis were also performed to ensure the robustness ofthese models. Among these models, model from split 3 obtained by using hybriddescriptors (combination of SMILES and HSG with 0ECk connectivity) was used toidentify and classify the structural attributes as promoters as well as hinderersof cytotoxicity for these 2-phenylindole derivatives. Results from the analysiswere further used to design and predict some probable new 2-phenylindolederivatives having promising cytotoxicity (IC50 < 55 nM) against MCF7.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
