Levels of evidence range from I to III.MAIN MESSAGE: As breast cancer survival rates increase, the focus of breastcancer management must shift to include the restoration of a patient's quality oflife after cancer. Breast reconstruction plays a crucial role in the restoration of normality for these women. Women who undergo mastectomy often suffer fromchallenges related to body image, self-esteem, and a decrease in quality of life scores. Cancer Care Ontario's Breast Cancer Treatment Pathway Map mandates thatall women diagnosed with breast cancer who might require mastectomy be referredto a plastic surgeon to discuss reconstructive options before surgery.CONCLUSION: The knowledge and guidance of primary care providers is critical toeffectively guiding and supporting patients who might undergo breastreconstruction in their decision-making processes. A thorough understanding ofpatient selection factors, modern options for breast reconstruction, and expectedoutcomes is essential.CopyrightÂ© the College of Family Physicians of Canada.PMCID: PMC5999246PMID: 29898931
