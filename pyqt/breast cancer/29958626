Due to its novel mechanism of action,eribulin therapy induces a distinct profile of adverse events, includingperipheral neuropathy. However, the incidence and risk of eribulin-relatedneurotoxicities are unclear. Here, we conducted a systematic search of PubMed andEmbase from their inception to October 2017. Eligible studies included trials in which eribulin was intravenously administered at a standard dose of 1.4 mg/m2over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8 on a 21-day cycle. The events of all-grade andhigh-grade peripheral neuropathy were collected to calculate the overallincidence and relative risk (RR). A total of thirty-two studies containing 6129subjects were included in this analysis. The incidences of all-grade andhigh-grade eribulin monotherapy-related peripheral neuropathy were 28% (95%confidence interval [CI], 24%-32%) and 4% (95% CI, 3%-5%), respectively. Subgroupanalysis further revealed that a higher incidence of neurotoxicities was observedin patients with breast cancer and those with longer treatment duration.Moreover, eribulin-treated subjects had a significantly increased risk ofall-grade (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.70-2.35; p = 0.008) and high-grade (RR, 3.68; 95% CI, 2.30-5.89; p<0.001) neurotoxicities. Our results suggested that patientstreated with eribulin had an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
