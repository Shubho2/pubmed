Mitochondrial metabolism is connected with several mitochondrial pathways such as ROS signaling, Ca2+ homeostasis,mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis. These pathways are merged in aninteractive super-network that seems to play a crucial role in cancer. Germlinemutations of the BRCA1 gene account for 5-10% of breast cancers and confer a riskof developing the disease 10- to 20-fold much higher than in non-carriers. Byconsidering metabolic networks that could reconcile both genetic and non-genetic causal mechanisms in BRCA1 driven tumorigenesis, we herein based our study on thehypothesis that BRCA1 haploinsufficiency might drive metabolic rewiring in breastepithelial cells, acting as a push toward malignant transformation. Using 2D-DIGEwe analyzed and compared the mitochondrial proteomic profile of sporadic breastcancer cell line (MCF7) and BRCA1 mutated breast cancer cell line (HCC1937).Image analysis was carried out with Decider Software, and proteins differentiallyexpressed were identified by LC-MS/MS on a quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer Q-Exactive. Ingenuity pathways analysis software was used to analyze thefifty-three mitochondrial proteins whose expression resulted significantlyaltered in response to BRCA1 mutation status. Mitochondrial Dysfunction andoxidative phosphorylation, and energy production and nucleic acid metabolismwere, respectively, the canonical pathway and the molecular function mainlyaffected. Western blotting analysis was done to validate the expression and thepeculiar mitochondrial compartmentalization of specific proteins such us HSP60and HIF-1α. Particularly intriguing is the correlation between BRCA1 mutationstatus and HIF-1α localization into the mitochondria in a BRCA1 dependent manner.Data obtained led us to hypothesize an interesting connection between BRCA1 andmitochondria pathways, capable to trigger metabolic changes, which, in turn,sustain the high energetic and anabolic requirements of the malignant phenotype.DOI: 10.3390/proteomes6020016 PMCID: PMC6027205PMID: 29584711
