However, the invivo availability of Ce6 is significantly restricted by its low water solubility and poor ability to target tumors. We sought to overcome the limitations of Ce6by using albumin nanoparticles with nab™ (nanoparticle albumin-bound) technology.The fabricated albumin nanoparticles consisted of bovine serum albumin (BSA),Ce6-BSA, and beta-carotene as a carrier, photosensitizing agent, andcross-linker, respectively. These albumin nanoparticles (Ce6-BSA-BC-NPs) did not include any toxic chemotherapeutics but instead contained naturally safebeta-carotene and Ce6, which was activated only upon irradiation with 660-nmlaser light. Ce6-BSA-BC-NPs were ∼120 nm in size and spherical, similar toAbraxane®, and showed good physicochemical stability. The nanoparticles showedsignificant cytotoxicity toward 4T1 cells as evaluated by MTT, Live/Dead, andTUNEL assays. In particular, results of the TUNEL assay demonstrated that celldeath induced by Ce6-BSA-BC-NPs and light irradiation (660 nm) occurred throughthe apoptotic pathway. Ce6-BSA-BC-NPs displayed a remarkably enhanced tumorsuppression effect when irradiated by 660-nm light compared with free Ce6 (tumor volume 90 ± 39 versus 487 ± 69 mm3 respectively). Overall, this improved in vivo antitumor efficacy seemed to be due to the targetability of albuminnanoparticles. We believe that our Ce6-BSA-BC-NPs with PDT offer a promising new potential therapeutic platform for breast cancer treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
