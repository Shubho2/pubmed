In this study, we sought to develop a model to predict TNBC patientswith negative nodal involvement, who would benefit from the exemption of theaxillary staging surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) profiles usingmicroarray data of TNBC from two Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Samples fromGSE31519 were divided into training set (n = 164) and validation set (n = 163),and GSE76275 was used to construct testing set (n = 164). We built a six-member3'UTR panel (ADD2, COL1A1, APOL2, IL21R, PKP2, and EIF4G3) using an elastic netmodel to estimate the risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM). Receiver operatingcharacteristic and logistic analyses were used to assess the association between the panel and LNM status.RESULTS: The six-member 3'UTR-panel showed a high distinguishing power with anarea under the curve of 0.712, 0.729, and 0.708 in the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. After adjustment by tumor size, the 3'UTR panelretained significant predictive power in the training, validation, and testingsets (odds ratio = 4.93, 4.58, and 3.59, respectively; p < .05 for all). Acombinatorial analysis of the 3'UTR panel and tumor size yielded an accuracy of97.2%, 100%, and 100% in training, validation, and testing set, respectively.CONCLUSION: This study established an integrative 3'UTR-based model as apromising predictor for nodal negativity in operable TNBC. Although a prospectivestudy is needed to validate the model, our results may permit a no axillarysurgery option for selected patients.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Currently, sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard approach for surgical staging in breast cancer patients with negative axillae.Prediction estimation for lymph node metastasis of breast cancer relies onclinicopathological characteristics, which is unreliable, especially intriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-a highly heterogeneous disease. The authors developed and validated an effective prediction model for the lymph node statusof patients with TNBC, which integrates 3'UTR markers and tumor size. This is thefirst 3'UTR-based model that will help identify TNBC patients with low risk ofnodal involvement who are most likely to benefit from exemption axillary surgery.Â© AlphaMed Press 2018.DOI: 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0609 PMID: 30082491
