Epub2018 Mar 22.Separase Inhibitor Sepin-1 Inhibits Foxm1 Expression and Breast Cancer CellGrowth.Zhang N(1), Pati D(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pediatrics, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College ofMedicine, Houston, Texas, USA.Sepin-1, a potent non-competitive inhibitor of separase, inhibits cancer cellgrowth, but the mechanisms of Sepin-1-mediated growth inhibition are not fullyunderstood. Here we report that Sepin-1 hinders growth of breast cancer cells,cell migration, and wound healing. Inhibition of cell growth induced by Sepin-1in vitro doesn't appear to be through apoptosis but rather due to growthinhibition. Following Sepin-1 treatment caspases 3 and 7 are not activated andPoly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (Parp) is not cleaved. The expression of Forkheadbox protein M1 (FoxM1), a transcription factor, and its target genes in the cell cycle, including Plk1, Cdk1, Aurora A, and Lamin B1, are reduced in aSepin-1-dependent manner. Expressions of Raf kinase family members A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf also are inhibited following treatment with Sepin-1. Raf is anintermediator in the Raf-Mek-Erk signaling pathway that phosphorylates FoxM1.Activated FoxM1 can promote its own transcription via a positive feedback loop.Sepin-1-induced downregulation of Raf and FoxM1 may inhibit expression of cellcycle-driving genes, resulting in inhibition of cell growth.DOI: 10.4172/1948-5956.1000517 PMCID: PMC5959057PMID: 29780443
