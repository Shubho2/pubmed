Hypoxic microenvironment gives rise to alteredcellular metabolism and triggers varied molecular responses. These responsespromote tumor progression and confer radiation resistance and chemo resistance totumors. The predominant molecules that are associated with hypoxia research arethe hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs are known to regulate a large group ofgenes that are involved in cell survival, proliferation, motility, metabolism, pHregulation, extracellular matrix function, inflammatory cell recruitment andangiogenesis by inducing the expression of their downstream target genes. Theprocess of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been associated withmetastasis in cancer. Reports also suggest that hypoxia triggers EMT in severaltypes of cancer including breast cancer, prostate cancer and oral cancer. Oralcancer is a predominant cancer in Central and South East Asia. However, in therecent times, the incidence rates of oral cancer have been increasing in Northernand Eastern Europe as well. This review articulates the role of hypoxia and theassociated factors like HIFs in inducing EMT in oral cancer (OSCC).Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
