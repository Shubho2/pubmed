Three groups weredivided according to body mass index (BMI) when breast cancer diagnosis: normalweight, BMI < 25.0 kg/m; overweight, 25.0≤BMI < 30.0 kg/m; and obesity,BMI≥30.0 kg/m. The clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes ofpatients within 5 years following breast cancer diagnosed were analyzed. Subgroupanalyses of BMI on breast cancer prognosis were analyzed according to themenopausal status when breast cancer diagnosis. The Cox proportional hazardsmodel was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals(CIs).RESULTS: Overweight and obesity groups were associated with larger size tumors,older age, increased proportion of postmenopausal patients and less patientschoosing anthracycline and/or taxane regimen. The 5-year disease-free survival(DFS) and overall survival (OS) decreased in overweight and obese patients(P < .001), and both overweight and obesity were independent predictors forincreased risks of breast cancer relapse and death (P < .001). When stratified bymenopausal status, both overweight and obesity were associated with reduced5-year DFS and OS in postmenopausal patients (P < .050), and multivariateanalysis showed that the risk of relapse and breast cancer mortality in these 2groups also increased (P < .050). Among premenopausal patients, the risks ofrelapse and death were significantly increased in obesity group rather thanoverweight group by multivariate analysis.CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity might be independently associated with poorer prognosis for breast cancer patients, and the effects of overweight on the breastcancer prognosis seem to be related to menopausal status.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011220 PMCID: PMC6039647PMID: 29952978  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
