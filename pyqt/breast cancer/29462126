Methods:We introduceda high-throughput screening platform to identify surface antigens that associate with epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity in well-defined pairs of epithelial celllines and their mesenchymal counterparts. Using multicolour flow cytometry, wethen analysed the expression of 10 most robustly changed antigens and identified a 10-molecule surface signature, in pan-cytokeratin-positive/EpCAM-positive and-negative fractions of dissociated breast tumours. Results:We found that surface CD9, CD29, CD49c, and integrin ß5 are lost in breast cancer cells that underwent EMT in vivo. The tetraspanin family member CD9 was concordantly downregulatedboth in vitro and in vivo and associated with epithelial phenotype and favourableprognosis. Conclusions:We propose that overall landscape of 10-molecule surfacesignature expression reflects the epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity in breastcancer.DOI: 10.1038/bjc.2017.497 PMCID: PMC5886127 [Available on 2019-03-20]PMID: 29462126
