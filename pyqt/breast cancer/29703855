PPR is voluntary for private hospitals. The aims of thisstudy were to assess whether PPR of hospital data is used by patients withbreast, bowel or lung cancer when selecting a hospital for elective surgery andhow PPR could be improved to meet their information needs.DESIGN: A national cross-sectional postal questionnaire.SETTING: Australian private healthcare sector.PARTICIPANTS: Private patients with breast, bowel or lung cancer who attended apublic or private hospital for elective surgery (n=243) in 2016.OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' choice of hospital, use of PPR information andpreferred areas of PPR information. Descriptive and conventional qualitativecontent analyses were conducted.RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-eight respondents (94%) attended a privatehospital. Almost half could choose a hospital. Choice of hospital was notinfluenced by PPR data (92% unaware) but by their specialist (90%). Respondentsconsidered PPR to be important (71%) but they did not want to see theinformation, preferring their general practitioners (GPs) to tell them about it(40%). Respondents considered surgery costs (59%), complications (58%) andrecovery success rates (57%) to be important areas of information that should be publicly reported. Almost half suggested that quality indicators should bereported at the individual clinician level. Analysis of the open-ended questions identified four themes: (1) decision-making factors; (2) data credibility; (3)unmet information needs and (4) unintended consequences.CONCLUSIONS: PPR of hospital data had no substantial impact on patients' choiceof hospital. Nonetheless, many respondents expressed interest in using it infuture. To increase PPR awareness and usability, personalised and integratedinformation on cost and quality of hospitals is required. Dissemination of PPRinformation via specialists and GPs could assist patients to interpret the dataand support decision-making.Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
