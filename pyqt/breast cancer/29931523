The limited knowledge as to long-termsurvival is nonuniform. This retrospective study aims to contribute by afollow-up of pregnancies of breast cancer patients treated at a single universitycentre with focus on maternal long-term survival in relation to time point ofdiagnosis (before, during, and after pregnancy).METHODS: Data of 25 patients were reviewed for the period between 2000 and 2009in relation to their neonatal and maternal outcome parameters as well as theirmaternal breast cancer outcomes by assessing maternal mortality at annualintervals up to a maximum of 10 years follow-up.RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 33 years. Maternal survival rate of thetotal collective came to 76% after 5 years and to 68% after 10 years. Thenewborns were healthy, 22% of them presented with a 1'Apgar score 5-7. Pretermdelivery occurred in 53%. PABC significantly affected maternal survival compared to the national breast cancer cohort at 5 years and barely significantly at10 years, with highly significant (p < 0.003) to significant (p < 0.01) effectsat 5 and 10 years, respectively, for PABC diagnosed during and after pregnancy.CONCLUSIONS: The present findings on survival rates suggest that maternal medicalassessment at the beginning of and during further course of pregnancy shouldinclude a scrutinized thorough breast examination. Conveying/delivering specialcompetences to monitor these high-risk pregnancies at the interface ofoncological care should be considered an obligatory part of academic medicaleducation, obstetrical training and interprofessional midwifery education.DOI: 10.1007/s00404-018-4822-5 PMID: 29931523
