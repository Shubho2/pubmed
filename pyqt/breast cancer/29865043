Focal-nodular-hyperplasias (FNH) served as a reference for benign lesions.DCEUS-clips were recorded continuously over three minutes. DCEUS-values werecompared between the tumor entities. For better inter-individual comparability,perfusion kinetics were analyzed considering the perfusion characteristics of thesurrounding liver parenchyma (Relative Signal Intensity = RSI: lesion-livertissue/liver tissue) at different points in time.RESULTS: Absolute signal intensity in FNH showed a tendency towards higher valuescompared with malignant liver lesions [Peak Enhancement(a.u.): FNH 7111.4; HCC549.9; CCC -6654.3; PCA -7307.9; BC -4562.4; CRC -10672.9; MM -3034.1]. Washoutwas significantly less in FNH versus PCA and CRC, and more pronounced and earlierin PCA and CRC versus HCC [RSI 30 seconds after PE-lesion(%): FNH +52; PCA -65;CRC -76; HCC -26]. Rise Time, Fall Time and mean-Transit-Time did not differsignificantly.CONCLUSIONS: DCEUS-values reflect significant differences between malignant liverlesions, especially at peak enhancement and during the washout phases.DOI: 10.3233/CH-180378 PMID: 29865043
