During re-entry, clinicians can educate survivors on the benefits of healthy behaviors, including physical activity, assurvivors adjust to life after cancer. We examine the prevalence of adherence to established aerobic physical activity guidelines (≥150 minutes ofmoderate-intensity physical activity per week) in addition to relatedmedico-demographic factors among cancer survivors during re-entry.METHODS: Data from 1,160 breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivorsparticipating in the American Cancer Society's National Cancer SurvivorTransition Study were examined. Multinomial logistic regression was used tocalculate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for various medico-demographic variables in relation to 4 established levels of physical activity (inactive, insufficientlyactive, 1-<2 times the guideline level, and ≥2 times the guideline level[referent group]).RESULTS: Overall, 8.1% were inactive, 34.1% were insufficiently active, 24.3%were within 1 to less than 2 times the guidelines, and 33.4% exceeded guidelines by 2 or more times. Inactive people had significantly higher odds of being women (AOR, 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-3.23) and having lower educationlevels (AOR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.21-3.38) compared with those who exceeded guidelinesby 2 or more times. Each additional comorbidity was associated with a 26%increase in odds of inactivity (AOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.08-1.47).CONCLUSION: Patient education on the benefits of regular physical activity isimportant for all cancer survivors and may be especially important to reviewafter treatment completion to promote healthy habits during this transitionperiod. Survivors who are women, are less educated, and have comorbid conditions may be less likely to be compliant with physical activity guidelines.DOI: 10.5888/pcd15.170277 PMCID: PMC5985854PMID: 29806579
