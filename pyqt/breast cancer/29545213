We hypothesized that benign inflammatory lesions might be differentiated form malignancies using a combination of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)values derived from diffusion weighted images (DWI) and T2WI.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 162 patients undergoing breastMRI (T2WI, DWI and DCE images) between 2008 and 2015 who had breast lesions with high T2WI signal intensity (High T2 SI) including 14 benign inflammatory lesions,69 benign non-inflammatory lesions, 16 malignant inflammatory lesions and 63malignant non-inflammatory lesions. On the High T2 SI and low T2WI signalintensity (Low T2 SI) areas in these breast lesions, we calculated ADC valuesfrom b values of 0 and 1000 s/mm2.RESULTS: The mean ADC values ± standard deviation (10-3 mm2/s) of the High T2 SI areas in benign inflammatory, benign non-inflammatory, malignant inflammatory andmalignant non-inflammatory breast lesions were 0.75 ± 0.18, 1.77 ± 0.33,2.06 ± 0.32 and 1.88 ± 0.41, respectively. Those of the Low T2 SI areas in benigninflammatory, benign non-inflammatory, malignant inflammatory and malignantnon-inflammatory lesions were 0.89 ± 0.15, 1.31 ± 0.28, 0.87 ± 0.20 and0.94 ± 0.27 respectively. ADC values of High T2 SI areas of the benigninflammatory lesions were significantly lower than those of benignnon-inflammatory, malignant inflammatory, and malignant non-inflammatory lesions (p < 0.001). ADC values of Low T2 SI areas in benign inflammatory lesions werenot significantly different from those of malignant inflammatory (p = 0.99) ormalignant non-inflammatory lesions (p = 0.72).CONCLUSION: For breast lesions with High T2 SI, segmenting the High T2 SI for ADCmapping distinguishes benign from malignant inflammatory conditions. Using ADCmapping of the Low T2 SI areas will not result in this distinction.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.mri.2018.03.012 PMID: 29545213
