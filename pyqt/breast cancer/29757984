Although many of these functions are driven by or related to its transcriptional/epigenetic regulator activity, there has been no genome-wide study to reveal the transcriptional/epigenetic targets of BRCA1. Therefore, weconducted a comprehensive analysis of genomics/transcriptomics data to identifynovel BRCA1 target genes. We first analyzed ENCODE data with BRCA1 chromatinimmunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing results and identified a set of genes with a promoter occupied by BRCA1. We collected 3085 loci with a BRCA1 ChIP signalfrom four cell lines and calculated the distance between the loci and the nearestgene transcription start site (TSS). Overall, 66.5% of the BRCA1-bound loci fell into a 2-kb region around the TSS, suggesting a role in transcriptionalregulation. We selected 45 candidate genes based on gene expression correlationdata, obtained from two GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) datasets and TCGA data ofhuman breast cancer, compared to BRCA1 expression levels. Among them, we further tested three genes (MEIS2, CKS1B and FADD) and verified FADD as a novel directtarget of BRCA1 by ChIP, RT-PCR, and a luciferase reporter assay. Collectively,our data demonstrate genome-wide transcriptional regulation by BRCA1 and suggest target genes as biomarker candidates for BRCA1-associated breast cancer.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19051458 PMCID: PMC5983697PMID: 29757984
