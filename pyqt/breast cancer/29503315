Thisstudy used breast cancer data from the Washington D.C. Cancer Registry (2000-2010). Logistic regression and survival analysis assessed the association betweenrace, socioeconomic (SES) variables, clinicopathological variables,recurrence-free survival and overall survival. African American (AA) breastcancer patients had an increased risk for stage III, ER-, and PR-breast cancercompared with White and Hispanic breast cancer patients. Additionally, D.C.geographical areas of lower socioeconomic status had higher incidences of stageIII and stage IV breast cancer. A nested analysis demonstrated that AAs withhigher median incomes compared with AAs with lower incomes revealed nodifferences for clinicopathological variables, nor were differences found betweenoverall and recurrence-free survival. This study suggests that the biology ofbreast cancer in AAs could be driving breast cancer disparities.DOI: 10.1353/hpu.2018.0034 PMID: 29503315
