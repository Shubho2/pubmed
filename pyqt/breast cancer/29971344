Surveys weresent approximately 2 months after surgery. Also surveyed were 488 attendingsurgeons identified by the patients.Main Outcomes and Measures: The study examined the association of surgeon withvariation in the receipt of genetic testing using information from patient andsurgeon surveys merged to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and genetictesting data obtained from 4 laboratories.Results: In total, 5080 women (69.6%) of 7303 who were eligible (mean [SD] age,61.4 [0.8] years) and 377 surgeons (77.3%) of 488 (mean [SD] age, 53.8 [10.7]years) responded to the survey. Approximately one-third (34.5% [1350 of 3910] of patients had an elevated risk of mutation carriage, and 27.0% (1056 of 3910)overall had genetic testing. Surgeons had practiced a mean (SE) of 20.9 (0.6)years, and 28.9% (107 of 370) treated more than 50 cases of new breast cancer peryear. The odds of a patient receiving genetic testing increased more than 2-fold (odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.85-3.31) if she saw a surgeon with an approach 1 SD above that of a surgeon with the mean test rate. Approximately one-third (34.1%) of the surgeon variation was explained by patient volume and surgeon attitudesabout genetic testing and counseling. If a patient with higher pretest risk saw asurgeon at the 5th percentile of the surgeon distribution, she would have a 26.3%(95% CI, 21.9%-31.2%) probability of testing compared with 72.3% (95% CI,66.7%-77.2%) if she saw a surgeon at the 95th percentile.Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the attending surgeon was associatedwith the receipt of genetic testing after a breast cancer diagnosis. Variation insurgeon attitudes about genetic testing and counseling may explain a substantial amount of this association.DOI: 10.1001/jamasurg.2018.2001 PMID: 29971344
