Two of the more complex cases had adverse clinical outcomes. Chromosomes 8 was commonly involved in the samechromoanasynthesis with 17. In ten cases where chromosome 8 was involved weobserved NRG1 fusions (two cases), NRG1 amplification (one case), FGFR1amplification and ADAM32 or ADAM5 fusions. ERBB3 over-expression was associatedwith NRG1 fusions and EGFR and ERBB3 expressions were anti-correlated. Of theremaining three cases, one had a small duplication fully encompassing ERBB2 andwas accompanied with a pathogenic mutation.CONCLUSION: Chromoanasynthesis involving chromosome 17 can lead to ERBB2amplifications in HER2+ breast cancer. However, additional large genomicalterations contribute to a high level of genomic complexity, generating thehypothesis that worse outcome could be associated with multiplechromoanasynthetic events.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4594-0 PMCID: PMC6045826PMID: 30005627
