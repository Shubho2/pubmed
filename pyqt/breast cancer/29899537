Effective treatment using systemically administeredtherapeutics is hindered by the barriers of the CNS. Ultrasound can mediatedelivery of drugs through these barriers. The goal of this study was to test the feasibility of using ultrasound-mediated drug delivery to improve the treatmentof LM. LM was induced in the spinal cord of athymic rats by injectingHER2-expressing breast cancer cells into the subarachnoid space of the thoracicspine. Animals were divided into three groups: no treatment (n = 5), trastuzumab only (n = 6) or trastuzumab + focused ultrasound + microbubbles (FUS + MBs)(n = 7). Animals in groups 2 and 3 were treated weekly with intravenoustrastuzumab +/- FUS + MBs for three weeks. Suppression in tumor growth wasqualitatively observed by MRI in the group receiving ultrasound, and wasconfirmed by a significant difference in the tumor volume measured from thehistology data (25 ± 17 mm3 vs 8 ± 5 mm3, p = 0.04 in the trastuzumab-only vstrastuzumab + FUS + MBs). This pilot study demonstrates the potential ofultrasound-mediated drug delivery as a novel treatment for LM. Future studieswill extend this work to larger cohorts and the investigation of LM arising from other cancers.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27335-y PMCID: PMC5998139PMID: 29899537
