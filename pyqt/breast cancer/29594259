Canonical PRL signaling activates STAT5A/B, homologous proteins that have different target genes and functions. Although STAT5A/B are important forphysiological mammary function and tumor pathophysiology, little is known aboutregulation of their expression, particularly of STAT5B, and the consequences for hormone action. In this study, we examined the effect of two estrogenic ligands, 17β-estradiol (E2) and the clinical antiestrogen, ICI182,780 (ICI, fulvestrant)on expression of STAT5 isoforms and resulting crosstalk with PRL in normal andtumor murine mammary epithelial cell lines. In all cell lines, E2 and ICIsignificantly increased protein and corresponding nascent and mature transcripts for STAT5A and STAT5B, respectively. Transcriptional regulation of STAT5A andSTAT5B by E2 and ICI, respectively, is associated with recruitment of estrogenreceptor alpha and increased H3K27Ac at a common intronic enhancer 10 kbdownstream of the Stat5a transcription start site. Further, E2 and ICI induceddifferent transcripts associated with differentiation and tumor behavior. Intumor cells, E2 also significantly increased proliferation, invasion, and stemcell-like activity, whereas ICI had no effect. To evaluate the role of STAT5B in these responses, we reduced STAT5B expression using short hairpin (sh) RNA.shSTAT5B blocked ICI-induced transcripts associated with metastasis and theepithelial mesenchymal transition in both cell types. shSTAT5B also blockedE2-induced invasion of tumor epithelium without altering E2-induced transcripts. Together, these studies indicate that STAT5B mediates a subset of protumorigenic responses to both E2 and ICI, underscoring the need to understand regulation ofits expression and suggesting exploration as a possible therapeutic target inbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1210/js.2017-00399 PMCID: PMC5842396PMID: 29594259
