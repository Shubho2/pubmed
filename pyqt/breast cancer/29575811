However, the functional role of SeDs on angiogenesis, which is pivotal for tumor progression and metastasis, has not yet been elucidated. In the presentstudy, we have examined the antiangiogenic activities of SeDs and elucidatedtheir underlying mechanisms. The results showed that the as-synthesized SeDs not only enhanced their anticancer activities against several human cancer cells but also showed more potent inhibition on human umbilical vein endothelial cells(HUVECs). The in vitro results suggested that SeDs, especially 1 a,dose-dependently inhibited the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced cell migration, invasion, and capillary-like structure formation of HUVECs.Compound 1 a also significantly suppressed VEGF-induced angiogenesis in aMatrigel plug assay as part of a C57/BL6 mice assay by means of down regulationof VEGF. Furthermore, we found that 1 a significantly inhibited MCF-7 humanbreast tumor growth in nude mice without severe systematic cytotoxicity. Compound1 a was more effective in inhibiting cell proliferation and induced a much morepronounced apoptosis effect in endothelial cells than MCF-7 cells, which implies that endothelial cells might be the primary target of 1 a. Further mechanisticstudies on tumor growth inhibition effects and neovessel formation suppressiondemonstrated that 1 a inhibited cell viability of MCF-7 and HUVECs by inductionof cell apoptosis, accompanied by poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose)polymerase(PARP) cleavage and caspase activation. Additionally, the 1 a-inducedantiangiogenesis effect was achieved by abolishing the VEGF-VEGFR2-ERK/AKT(ERK=extracellular signal-regulated kinases; AKT=protein kinease B) signal axisand enhanced the apoptosis effect by triggering reactive oxygen species(ROS)-mediated DNA damage. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate the antiangiogenic potency of SeDs and the underlying molecular mechanisms.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
