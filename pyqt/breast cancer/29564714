Palbociclib, a specific inhibitor of CDK4/6with outstanding clinical efficacy data and limited toxicity, has been recentlyapproved for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breastcancer, either in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. This reviewdescribes the mechanism of action, preclinical experiences and clinical data ofpalbociclib, with a special focus on integrating this data with the positioningof palbociclib in the current clinical guidelines for advancedHR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Aspects of the ongoing major studies arealso presented, as well as future prospects in the development of palbociclib.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1850-3 PMID: 29564714
