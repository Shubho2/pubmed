Developing countriesare increasingly adopting a Western lifestyle, such as changes in diet anddelayed first childbirth, lower parity, and shorter periods of breastfeeding,which are important determinants of a higher incidence of breast cancer amongthose regions. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) represent most of thecountries with the highest mortality rates, ranging from 40% to 60%. Furthermore,developing countries account for scarce survival data, and the few data availablecoincide with the observed incidence and mortality differences. Five-yearsurvival rates for breast cancer are much worse for LMICs countries such asBrazil, India, and Algeria in comparison with the United States and Sweden.Paucity of early detection programs explain these poor survival rates, whichresults in a high proportion of women presenting with late-stage disease, alongwith lack of adequate diagnosis and treatment facilities. Emphasis is urgentlyneeded on health education, to promote early diagnosis of breast cancer,highlighting the importance of creating more public facilities that providetreatment, which are key components for the improvement in breast cancer care in developing countries.DOI: 10.1177/1178223417752677 PMCID: PMC5802601PMID: 29434475
