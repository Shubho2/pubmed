Interaction of EGFR with its ligand epidermal growth factor (EGF)activates cellular signalling cascades promoting tumour invasion. Matrixmetalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) areupregulated in most cancers and play crucial roles in modulating invasion andmetastasis. EGFR-mediated regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in breast cancer wasinvestigated using metastatic human breast ductal carcinoma cell line MCF-7.Culture of MCF-7 cells on 1 µg/ml EGF-coated culture dishes for 24 h led toappreciable increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity. Expression ofmembrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and focal adhesion kinase(FAK), phosphorylation of EGFR and phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K), andnuclear translocation of EGFR and cellular migration were also appreciablyincreased. Targeting EGFR-EGF interactions by treatment of MCF-7 cells withanti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies prior to culture on EGF prevented appreciableupregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity. Increased expression of MT1-MMP and FAK, phosphorylation of EGFR and PI3K and enhanced cell migrationwere also inhibited. Treatment of cells with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 preventedupregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 indicating that EGFR-mediated signalling for MMP regulation occurs through PI3K. As increased EGFR activity has been observed inhighly invasive breast cancers, targeting EGFR-EGF interactions might render suchcancers less invasive by inhibiting EGFR-mediated upregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9and therefore could be of importance in their clinical management.DOI: 10.1007/s11010-018-3417-6 PMID: 30074136
