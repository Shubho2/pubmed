As calcium influx is known to effectinflammatory response and drug resistance, we examined the impact of high salt oncalcium influx in breast cancer cells. Treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cellswith high salt induced an enhanced intracellular calcium intensity, which wassignificantly decreased by store operated calcium entry (SOCE) inhibitorco-treatment. Further, high salt induced P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediatedpaclitaxel drug resistance in breast cancer cells. Murine tumor studiesdemonstrated that injection of MCF-7 cells cultured in high salt, exerted higher tumorigenicity compared to the basal cultured counterpart. Knock down of SIK3 by specific shRNA inhibited tumorigenicty, expression of SOCE regulators and P-gpactivity, suggesting SIK3 is an upstream mediator of SOCE induced calcium influx.Furthermore, small molecule inhibitor, prostratin, exerted anti-tumor effect inmurine models through SIK3 inhibition. Taken together, we conclude that SIK3 isan upstream regulator of store operated calcium entry proteins, Orai1 and STIM1, and mediates high salt induced inflammatory cytokine responses and P-gp mediated drug resistance. Therefore, small molecule inhibitors, such as prostratin, could offer novel anti-cancer approaches.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25391 PMCID: PMC5982760PMID: 29861863
