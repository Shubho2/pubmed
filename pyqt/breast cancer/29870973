This single center study aimed tocharacterize GIST patients in terms of tumor location, clinical presentation,metastasis formation, as well as associated secondary malignancies.METHODS: In a retrospective study, 104 patients with a histologically confirmeddiagnosis of GIST, collected between 1993 and 2011, were characterized forseveral clinical features.RESULTS: The most common GIST location was the stomach (67.6%) followed by thesmall intestine (16.2%). Gastrointestinal bleeding (55.8%) and abdominal pain(38.5%) were the most frequently reported symptoms whereas about one-third ofpatients remained clinically asymptomatic (31.6%); 14.4% of patients had eithersynchronous or metachronous metastases and there was a significant prevalencealso in the low risk group. The proportion of secondary malignant associatedneoplasms was 31% in our GIST cohort, among which gastrointestinal, genitourinarytumors, and breast cancer were the most prevalent.CONCLUSION: There was a considerable risk for metastasis formation and thedevelopment of secondary neoplasias that should encourage discussion about theappropriate surveillance strategy after surgery for GIST.© 2018 S.
