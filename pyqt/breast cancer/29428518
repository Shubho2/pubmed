We have shown that GALNT14 could promotebreast cancer cell invasion. However, the underlying molecular mechanism isunclear. Here, using yeast two hybrid, we find that EGF-containing fibulin-likeextracellular matrix protein 2 (EFEMP2) interacts with GALNT14. Both in vitro andin vivo binding assays show that EFEMP2 is associated with GALNT14. Moreover, we find that GALNT14 mediates glycosylation of EFEMP2. EFEMP2 significantlyincreased the invasion ability of breast cancer cells including MCF-7 andMBA-MD-231 cells, and this phenomenon is suppressed by knockdown expression ofGALNT14. In addition, the GALNT14-dependent O-glycosylation of EFEMP-2 regulates the stability of EFEMP-2 protein in breast cancer cells. Taken together, ourresults demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism underlying breast cancerinvasion.Copyright Â© 2018.
