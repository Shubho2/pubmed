Eligible patients were women with histologicallyconfirmed HER2-negative MBC without chemotherapy or only one chemotherapy linefor MBC. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR) and thesecondary endpoints included the clinical benefit rate (ORR + stable disease for 6 months; CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), safety, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).RESULTS: A total of 35 patients with HER2-negative MBC were enrolled betweenMarch 2013 and February 2017 (data cut-off July 31, 2017). The ORR was 37.1% (95%CI 21.1-53.2%). The CBR was 54.3% (95% CI 37.8-70.8%). The median PFS was6.2 months (95% CI 2.7-9.4 months) and median OS was 21.4 months (95% CI11.5-32.9 months). Common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (42.9%) butfebrile neutropenia (2.9%). Although the majority of non-hematological adverseevents were mild in severity, one patient died of pneumonitis. In HRQoL analysis,eribulin appeared to maintain HRQoL of many patients.CONCLUSIONS: Eribulin as first- or second-line chemotherapy is effective and has manageable toxicity for patients with HER2-negative MBC.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3567-y PMID: 29594360
