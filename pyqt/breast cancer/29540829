However, the role of LMTK3 inresponse to cytotoxic chemotherapy has not been investigated thus far. Using both2D and 3D tissue culture models, we found that overexpression of LMTK3 decreased the sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to cytotoxic (doxorubicin) treatment.In a mouse model we showed that ectopic overexpression of LMTK3 decreases theefficacy of doxorubicin in reducing tumor growth. Interestingly, breast cancercells overexpressing LMTK3 delayed the generation of double strand breaks (DSBs) after exposure to doxorubicin, as measured by the formation of γH2AX foci. Thiseffect was at least partly mediated by decreased activity ofataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM) as indicated by its reducedphosphorylation levels. In addition, our RNA-seq analyses showed that doxorubicindifferentially regulated the expression of over 700 genes depending on LMTK3protein expression levels. Furthermore, these genes were found to promote DNArepair, cell viability and tumorigenesis processes / pathways inLMTK3-overexpressing MCF7 cells. In human cancers, immunohistochemistry staining of LMTK3 in pre- and post-chemotherapy breast tumor pairs from four separateclinical cohorts revealed a significant increase of LMTK3 following bothdoxorubicin and docetaxel based chemotherapy. In aggregate, our findings show forthe first time a contribution of LMTK3 in cytotoxic drug resistance in breastcancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0197-0 PMCID: PMC5992129PMID: 29540829
