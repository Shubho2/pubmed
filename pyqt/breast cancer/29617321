They can transfer biomolecules into recipient cells. The main goal of the work was to study the exosome involvement in the cell transfer ofhormonal resistance. The experiments were performed on in vitro culturedestrogen-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cells and MCF-7 sublines resistant to SERMtamoxifen and/or biguanide metformin, which exerts its anti-proliferative effect,at least in a part, via the suppression of estrogen machinery. The exosomes were purified by differential ultracentrifugation, cell response to tamoxifen wasdetermined by MTT test, and the level and activity of signaling proteins weredetermined by Western blot and reporter analysis. We found that the treatment of the parent MCF-7 cells with exosomes from the resistant cells within 14 days leadto the partial resistance of the MCF-7 cells to antiestrogen drugs. The primaryresistant cells and the cells with the exosome-induced resistance werecharacterized with these common features: decrease in ER&alpha; activity andparallel activation of Akt and AP-1, NF-&kappa;B, and SNAIL1 transcriptionalfactors. In general, we evaluate the established results as the evidence of thepossible exosome involvement in the transferring of the hormone/metforminresistance in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23040829 PMID: 29617321
