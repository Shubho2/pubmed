The molecular determinants that drivethis adaptation to treatment remain poorly understood. Methylome aberrationsdrive cancer growth yet the functional role and mechanism of these epimutationsin drug resistance are poorly elucidated.Experimental Design: Genome-widemulti-omics sequencing approach identified a differentially methylated hub ofprodifferentiation genes in endocrine resistant breast cancer patients and cellmodels. Clinical relevance of the functionally validated methyl-targets wasassessed in a cohort of endocrine-treated human breast cancers andpatient-derived ex vivo metastatic tumors.Results: Enhanced globalhypermethylation was observed in endocrine treatment resistant cells and patient metastasis relative to sensitive parent cells and matched primary breast tumor,respectively. Using paired methylation and transcriptional profiles, we foundthat SRC-1-dependent alterations in endocrine resistance lead to aberranthypermethylation that resulted in reduced expression of a set of differentiation genes. Analysis of ER-positive endocrine-treated human breast tumors (n = 669)demonstrated that low expression of this prodifferentiation gene setsignificantly associated with poor clinical outcome (P = 0.00009). We demonstratethat the reactivation of these genes in vitro and ex vivo reverses the aggressivephenotype.Conclusions: Our work demonstrates that SRC-1-dependent epigeneticremodeling is a 'high level' regulator of the poorly differentiated state inER-positive breast cancer. Collectively these data revealed an epigeneticreprograming pathway, whereby concerted differential DNA methylation ispotentiated by SRC-1 in the endocrine resistant setting.
