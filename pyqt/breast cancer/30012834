SHIP2 is aphosphoinositide 5-phosphatase for PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2. Through depletionof SHIP2 in triple negative MDA-MB-231 cells and the use of SHIP2 inhibitors, it appeared that cell migration is positively controlled by SHIP2. The effect ofSHIP2 on migration, observed in MDA-MB-231 cells, appears to be mediated byPI(3,4)P2. Adhesion on fibronectin is always increased in SHIP2 depleted cells.Apoptosis measured in MDA-MB-231 cells is also increased in SHIP2 depleted cells as compared to control cells. In xenograft mice, SHIP2 depleted MDA-MB-231 cells form significantly smaller tumors compared to control cells and less metastasisdetected in lung sections. Our data reveal a general role of SHIP2 in the controlof cell migration in breast cancer cells and a second messenger role forPI(3,4)P2 in the migration mechanism. In this model, SHIP2 function on apoptosis on cells incubated in vitro, or in mice tumor digested cells, could account forits role on tumor growth determined in vivo.© 2018.
