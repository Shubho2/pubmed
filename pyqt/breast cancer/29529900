Methods This case-control studyincluded 228 patients with BC and 503 healthy women living in Pakistan who wereanalyzed for the VDR Tru9I (rs757343) single nucleotide polymorphism. BC caseswere histopathologically confirmed, and all healthy controls were age-matchedwith patients (age range, 20-45 years). DNA was extracted, and the polymerasechain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism assays wereperformed. Results The VDR Tru9I polymorphism was not significantly associatedwith premenopausal BC. However, the risk of BC was associated with the 'uu'genotype (odds ratio [OR], 1.141; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.206-6.317).Further, mutant Tru9I was significantly associated with Grade IV carcinoma (OR,5.36; 95% CI, 1.181-24.338). Conclusion The VDR Tru9I 'uu' genotype may increase the risk of premenopausal BC.DOI: 10.1177/0300060518761304 PMCID: PMC5991241PMID: 29529900
