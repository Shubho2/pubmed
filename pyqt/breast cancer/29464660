We aimed toinvestigate whether this association applies to thyroid cancer (TC).METHODS: A total of 276 Chinese Han people were recruited in a current matchedcase-control study. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was computed toestimate the association between plasma 25(OH)D and papillary thyroid cancer(PTC). In addition, we searched relevant studies in PubMed and Web of Sciencedatabases before December 2017 to conduct a meta-analysis.RESULTS: In our case-control study, plasma 25(OH)D concentration was inverselyassociated with PTC risk (highest tertile vs lowest tertile: adjusted OR = 0.25; 95% CI 0.10, 0.61; Ptrend = 0.003). This association was independent of body massindex and physical activity (all adjusted Pinteraction > 0.05). A total of 11studies were included in the meta-analysis, among which ten studies have beenpublished and one was our case-control study. Compared with 25(OH)D non-deficientgroup, the pooled OR of TC was 1.42 (95% CI 1.17, 1.73) in the deficient group.Similarly, blood 25(OH)D levels in patients with TC were tend to be lower thanthose in the controls (SMD = - 0.20, 95% CI - 0.36, - 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: A high level of circulating 25(OH)D was associated with a decreased TC risk. This association has important significance in public health and should,therefore, be further studied.DOI: 10.1007/s40618-018-0853-9 PMID: 29464660
