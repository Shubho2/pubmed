Most commonly used test methods for HER-2 areimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Weevaluated the concordance between FISH and IHC for HER-2 in breast cancer samplesusing Food and Drug Administration approved tests.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Archived paraffin tissue blocks from 73 breast cancerpatients were used. HER-2 immunostaining was performed using Ventana anti-HER-2monoclonal antibody. The FISH assay was performed using PathVysionâ„¢ HER-2 DNAProbe Kit.RESULTS: Of the 73 cases 68.5% were IHC 0/1+, 15.07% were IHC 2+ and 16.44% were IHC 3+. Successful hybridisation was achieved in 72 cases. HER-2 FISHamplification was determined in 16.67% cases. Ten IHC 3+ and two IHC 2+ caseswere FISH positive. Two of the IHC 3+ cases were FISH negative. Concordance rate was 100%, 18.18% and 83.33% for IHC 0/1+, 2+ and 3+ group, respectively. Totalconcordance was 84.72%, kappa 0.598 (p < 0.0001). The sensitivity of IHC indetecting IHC 2+ and IHC 3+ cases was 16.7% and 83.3%, and the specificity was85% and 96.67%, respectively.CONCLUSION: The consistency between the methods was highest for IHC negative and lowest for IHC equivocal cases. The immunohistochemistry showed high sensitivity for IHC 2+/3+ cases and high specificity for IHC 3+ cases. Our results supportthe view that false-positive rather than false-negative IHC results are a problemwith HER-2/IHC testing, and that IHC should be used as an initial screening test,but IHC 2+/ 3+ results should be confirmed by FISH.DOI: 10.3889/oamjms.2018.124 PMCID: PMC5927485PMID: 29731922
