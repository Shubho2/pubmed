Breast MRI detects additional disease, but this has not translatedinto improved outcomes. In light of a dramatic rise in MRI use, we investigatedpatterns of MRI ordering for newly diagnosed breast cancer. All newly diagnosedbreast cancer cases presenting for surgical management to a specialized breastcenter from 2011 to 2013 were reviewed. Patients who had an MRI ordered by their operating surgeon were compared with those who had an MRI completed previously.Of 1037 patients, 504 (49%) with newly diagnosed breast cancer underwent MRI aspart of their preoperative evaluation. Variables associated with MRI use includedcommercial insurance, increased breast density, genetic testing, mamographically occult disease, and lobular pathology. Of women who presented to our center with an MRI already completed, 63 per cent were ordered by a primary care provider. Ofthe 504 patients, 233 (44%) who had an MRI underwent an additional biopsy, and166 (33%) had a resultant change in management. There was no significantdifference in MRI-directed change in patient care depending on ordering provider.Further research is needed to develop evidence-based guidelines for preoperative MRI evaluation to optimize patient outcomes.PMID: 29559048  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
