Thecurrent evaluation method is via immunohistochemistry (IHC). In this paper, wecompared results of ER, PR, and HER2 from microarray gene expression to IHC in 81fresh breast cancer specimens.Methods: Gene expression profiling was performed using the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix Inc). Immunohistochemical staining for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 status was performed using standardmethods at a CAP-accredited pathology laboratory. Concordance rates, agreementmeasures, and kappa scores were calculated for both methods.Results: For ER, Kappa score was 0.918 (95% CI, 0.77.3-1.000) and concordancerate was 97.5% (95% CI, 91.4%-99.7%). For PR, Kappa score was 0.652 (95% CI,0.405-0.849) and concordance rate was 86.4% (95% CI, 77%-93%). For HER2, Kappascore was 0.709 (95% CI, 0.428-0.916) and concordance rate was 97.5% (95% CI,91.4%-99.7%).Conclusion: Our results are in line with the available evidence with theconcordance rate being the lowest for the progesterone receptor. In general,microarray gene expression and IHC proved to have high concordance rates. Severalfactors can increase the discordance rate such as differences in sampleprocessing.DOI: 10.1155/2018/8530318 PMCID: PMC6020516PMID: 30009057
