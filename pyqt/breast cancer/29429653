Theobtained product was employed to modify graphene oxide (GO) surface to produceGO-A-Im. The resulted hybrid was characterized with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM/EDS); X-ray Diffraction spectroscopy (XRD); X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS); Fluorescence spectroscopy; Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. Thesynthesized (A-Im) moiety that was used for functionalization of GO, display acyan emission around (496 nm), however, the GO hybrid exhibited bluephotoluminescence around (403 nm). It has been proposed that the chemicalattachment of the A-Im moiety onto GO surface leads to a distortion in thebandgap of the GO and the blue shift of luminescence [93 nm] was observed. Indeedthe cytotoxicity properties of the synthesized hybrid were measured. The IC50value for the hybrid was 23 µg/ml. The model drug (DOX) was loaded up to 91% onthe carrier, and the release profile indicated a pH-dependent discharge with morerelease in acidic pH. The GO-A-Im/DOX was injected to the 4T1 tumor (murinebreast cancer) bearing BALB/c mice and after 10 days the tumor was disappeared.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
