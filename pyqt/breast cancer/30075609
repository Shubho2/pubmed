In this study, we investigated the prognosis of patients whounderwent biopsy alone, as compared with other forms of thyroidectomy approaches.We sought to provide reference information for treatment selection in cases ofPTMC.The analysis included a large cohort of 34,972 PTMC patients from theSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2004 and2013. Survival was examined by Kaplan-Meier analyses with log-rank tests, Coxproportional-hazards regression analyses, and propensity score matchinganalyses.In the study cohort, the rate of cancer-specific mortality per 1000person-years was higher for patients who underwent biopsy alone than for thosewho underwent other surgical approaches. According to multivariate Cox regressionanalyses, patients undergoing biopsy had similar cancer-specific survival ratesand higher all-cause survival rates in comparison with patients undergoing other surgical approaches. After matching for influential factors using propensityscores, Kaplan-Meier analyses also showed that patients undergoing biopsy hadsimilar cancer-specific survival rates and lower all-cause survival rates incomparison with patients undergoing other surgical approaches.Our resultsprovided helpful implications for the treatment of patients with PTMC.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011791 PMID: 30075609
