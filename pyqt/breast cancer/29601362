[Epub ahead ofprint]Roles of Family Caregivers and Perceived Burden When Caring for HospitalizedAdult Cancer Patients: Perspective From a Low-Income Country.Muliira JK(1), Kizza IB, Nakitende G.Author information: (1)Author Affiliations: Department of Adult Health & Critical Care, College ofNursing, Sultan Qaboos University (Drs Muliira and Kizza), Muscat, Oman; andDepartment of Nursing, School of Health Sciences, College of Health Sciences,Makerere University (Ms Nakitende), Kampala, Uganda.BACKGROUND: Family caregivers (FCGs) of adult cancer patients (ACPs) aretypically involved in the entire trajectory of cancer disease, from diagnosis to survivorship or end of life. In developing countries, FCGs are more intenselyinvolved in the process of providing care to the hospitalized ACPs because oflack of adequate cancer care resources. Active performance of tasks to meet theneeds of ACPs in the hospital setting is likely to elicit significant caregiverburden.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the tasks performed and thecaregiver burden experienced by FCGs of hospitalized ACPs in a sub-Saharancountry.METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to collect data from 168FCGs of ACPs. The Caregiver Burden Scale was used to measure burden.RESULTS: The most common cancer diagnosis in male and female ACPs was Kaposi'ssarcoma (32.1%) and breast cancer (37.9%), respectively. The tasks regularlyperformed by most FCGs for the ACPs were providing emotional support (79.8%),feeding (68.5%), transporting to other appointments (62.5%), preparing meals(55%), and giving medications (46.4%). Most FCGs (75%) were experiencing severeor very severe general caregiver burden. The dimensions of caregiver burden that were most severely impacted were general strain (70.6%), disappointment (85.8%), and isolation (72%). Predictors of caregiver burden are reported.CONCLUSION: Family caregivers of hospitalized ACPs experience severe caregiverburden. The main forms of burden experienced were general strain, disappointment,and isolation.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Cancer care services in developing countries should bestrengthened with services that address FCGs' emotional needs and human resourcesto curtail the strain imposed on FCGs.DOI: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000591 PMID: 29601362
