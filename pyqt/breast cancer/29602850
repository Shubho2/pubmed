Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism prior to the diagnosis of breast cancer or the same index date was identified, age, histories of thyroid disease treatment, oestrogen use and radioactive iodine treatment wereadjusted.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To identify risk differences in developing breast canceramong patients with a medical history of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.RESULTS: There was a significantly increased risk of breast cancer in women with hyperthyroidism under the age of 55 years (age <45: OR 1.16, P=0.049; age 45-55: OR 1.15, P=0.019). Patients with hypothyroidism also showed an increased risk of breast cancer (OR 1.19, P=0.029) without statistical significance afterstratification by age group (age <45, 45-55, >55 years). Treatment for thyroiddisorders did not alter the association in subgroup analyses (P=0.857; 0.262,respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Asian women under 55 years of age with history of hyperthyroidismhave a significantly increased risk of breast cancer regardless of treatment.Women with history of hypothyroidism may also have an increased risk.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
