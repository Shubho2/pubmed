Email: amira.krir@outlook.comBackground: Due to progress in medical care, the number of survivors from cancer has increased significantly during recent years and this raises the question ofthe quality of life (QoL), especially of the many women treated for a breastcancer. This paper focuses on correlations of QoL with anxiety and depression on the one hand and with socio demographic, anatomo-clinical and therapeuticparameters on the other. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, seventy patientswere enrolled and filled in two auto-questionnaires, both in validated Arabicversions: The SF-36 for assessment of QoL and the Hospital Anxiety and DepressionScale (HAD-S) for evaluation of anxiety and depression. The statisticalapproaches used to determine predictive factors were bivariate correlations todetermine relationships between quantitative variables, and T-tests and one-wayAnova to analyze links between qualitative and quantitative variables. Results:The QoL of patients was altered with an SF-36 mean total score of 54.0 ± 22.7,and the alteration affects the different aspects. The mean scores for anxiety anddepression in patients were 6.91 ± 4.72 and 6.24 ± 3.88, respectively. Theresults of this study suggested an association between the QoL and chemotherapy(p= 0.014) and its adverse effects (p=0.01), as well as anxiety (p= 0.0001) anddepressive symptoms (p= 0.0001). Socio-demographic factors, the stage of thecancer, and surgery, radiotherapy or hormone therapy did not appear to havesignificant effects. Conclusion: The management of breast cancer patients needs acollaborative approach between oncologists, gynecologists, psychologist andpsychiatrists.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.6.1671 PMID: 29938464
