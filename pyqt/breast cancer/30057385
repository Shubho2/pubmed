[Epub ahead of print]Occult cancer and thromboembolism: current epidemiology and its practicalimplication.Chao CH, Wang HY, Kao CH.Venous thromboembolism (VTE) may be the first presentation of malignancy. Up to10% of patients of unprovoked VTE would be diagnosed with occult cancer within 1 year. Cancer patients with concomitant VTE would have worse outcome. In screenoccult cancer in VTE patients, while limited screening strategy (through history,physical examination, basic laboratory test and chest X-ray) and extensivescreening strategy (limited screening + CT scan of abdomen/pelvis or 18F-FDGPET/CT) shared similar ability in detecting early-stage cancer and improvingmorbidity/mortality of cancer patient, the extensive screening strategy coulddiagnose occult cancer earlier. Among the risk factors of occult cancer inpatients with unprovoked VTE, age is the most promising one. The risk of occultcancer detection increased with age. New developed RIETE score helped to identifyrisk of occult cancer and might decrease unnecessary diagnostic procedure inlower risk patients. Current guidance suggested patient with first unprovoked VTEto receive limited screening with age- and gender- specific cancer screening,including colon, breast, cervix and prostate.DOI: 10.20452/pamw.4311 PMID: 30057385
