Among them, high expression of SLCO2B1 is known to associate with the resistance to androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer (PCa). Wehypothesized that high expression of SLCO genes enhances PCa progression bypromoting the influx of androgen. Here, we demonstrated the impact of theexpression levels of SLCO2B1 on prognosis in localized PCa after radicalprostatectomy (RP) utilizing 494 PCa cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).SLCO2B1 high expression group showed significantly worse Disease-free survival(DFS) after RP (p = 0.001). The expression level of SLCO2B1 was significantlyhigher in advanced characteristics including Gleason Score (GS ≤ 6 vs GS = 7; p =0.047, GS = 7 vs GS ≥ 8; p = 0.002), pathological primary tumor (pT2 vs pT3/4; p < 0.001), and surgical margin status (positive vs negative; p = 0.013),respectively. There was a significant difference in DFS between these two groups only in GS ≥ 8 patients (p = 0.006). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that onlySLCO2B1 expression level was an independent predictor for DFS after RP in GS ≥ 8.SLCO2B1 high expressed tumors in GS ≥ 8 not only enriched epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) related gene set, (p = 0.027), as well as Hedgehog (p < 0.001), IL-6/JAK/STAT3 (p < 0.001), and K-ras signaling gene sets (p < 0.001), which are known to promote EMT, but also showed higher expression of EMT related genes,including N-cadherin (p = 0.024), SNAIL (p = 0.001), SLUG (p = 0.001), ZEB-1 (p <0.001) and Vimentin (p < 0.001). In conclusion, PCa with high expression ofSLCO2B1 demonstrated worse DFS, which might be due to accelerated EMT.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24453 PMCID: PMC5865664PMID: 29581838
