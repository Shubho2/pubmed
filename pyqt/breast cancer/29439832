Electronic address: Habermann.Elizabeth@mayo.edu.OBJECTIVE: To identify factors predicting positive margins at lumpectomyprompting intraoperative reexcision in patients with breast cancer treated at alarge referral center.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed all breast cancer lumpectomy cases managed atour institution from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2013. Associationsbetween rates of positive margin and patient and tumor factors were assessedusing χ2 tests and univariate and adjusted multivariate logistic regression,stratified by ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive cancer.RESULTS: We identified 382 patients who underwent lumpectomy for definitivesurgical resection of breast cancer, 102 for DCIS and 280 for invasive cancer.Overall, 234 patients (61.3%) required intraoperative reexcision for positivemargins. The reexcision rate was higher in patients with DCIS than in those with invasive disease (78.4% [80 of 102] vs 56.4% [158 of 280]; univariate odds ratio,2.80; 95% CI, 1.66-4.76; P<.001). Positive margin rates did not vary by patientage, surgeon, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or ERBB2 status of thetumor. Among the 280 cases of invasive breast cancer, the only factorindependently associated with lower odds of margin positivity was seedlocalization vs no localization (P=.03).CONCLUSION: Ductal carcinoma in situ was associated with a higher rate ofpositive margins at lumpectomy than invasive breast cancer on univariateanalysis. Within invasive disease, seed localization was associated with lowerrates of margin positivity.Copyright © 2017 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. Published byElsevier Inc.
