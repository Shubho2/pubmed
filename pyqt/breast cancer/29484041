The appearance of breast osteosarcoma on digital breast tomosynthesisimaging has not yet been described. A 69-year-old woman presents for routinescreening mammography and is found to have a calcified mass in her right breast. Pattern of calcification appeared "sunburst" on digital breast tomosynthesisimages. This mass was larger than on the previous year's mammogram, at which timeit had been interpreted as a benign calcified fibroadenoma. The subsequent workupdemonstrated the mass to reflect primary breast osteosarcoma. The patient'sworkup and treatment are detailed in this case. Primary breast osteosarcoma,although rare, should be included as a diagnostic consideration for breast masseswith a sunburst pattern of calcifications, particularly when the mammographicappearance has changed.DOI: 10.1016/j.radcr.2017.06.008 PMCID: PMC5823318PMID: 29484041
