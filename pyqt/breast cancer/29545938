China.Introduction: Approximately 5% of primary breast cancer patients present de novo stage IV breast cancer, for whom systematic therapy is the mainstream treatment. The role of surgical excision of the primary tumor has been controversial due to inconsistent results of relevant studies. Recently, with the reports of somerelevant preclinical data, retrospective studies and randomized clinical trials, we've got more evidence to reexamine the issue. Based on those above, aliterature review and meta-analysis was performed to determine whether surgery ofthe primary tumor could improve overall survival in the setting of stage IVbreast cancer.Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search of PubMed, OVID, American Societyof Clinical Oncology (ASCO) symposium documents, European Society for MedicalOncology (ESMO) symposium documents and San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium(SABCS) symposium documents was performed to identify published literature thatevaluated survival benefits from excision of the primary tumor in the setting of stage IV breast cancer. Data were extracted in review of appropriate studies bythe authors independently. The primary endpoint was overall survival followingsurgical removal of the primary tumor. Secondary endpoints were the impacts ofsurgery on progression free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP).Results: Data from 19 retrospective studies showed a pooled hazard ratio of 0.65 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.60-0.71, P < 0.01= for overall survival(OS), indicating a 35% reduction in risk of mortality in patients who underwentsurgical excision of the primary tumor. Nevertheless, the analysis of 3randomized clinical trials revealed a pooled hazard ratio of 0.85 (95% CI,0.59-1.21, P = 0.359) for OS in the surgical group. According to themeta-regression, the survival benefit was independent of age, tumor size, site ofthe metastases, and PR or HER-2 status, acceptance of systematic therapies andradiotherapy and inversely correlated with the ER+ status of the populationincluded.Conclusions: This is the first meta-analysis that includes both retrospective andprospective studies regarding the impact of surgery of the primary tumor onsurvival in stage IV breast cancer patients. According to the analytical results,we do not recommend surgery of the primary tumor as routine therapy for stage IV breast cancer. However, for those who are supposed to have long life expectancy, physicians could discuss it with these patients, put forward surgery as a therapychoice and perform the operation under deliberation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23189 PMCID: PMC5837759PMID: 29545938
