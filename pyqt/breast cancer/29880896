Inrecent years, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and theplatelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have emerged as prognostic biomarkers in many malignancies, but their predictive role in platinum-treated mTNBC patientsremains unexplored. We performed a retrospective, single centre study to evaluatethe association between baseline NLR or PLR and progression free survival (PFS)of mTNBC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. As a controlpopulation, we analysed data from patients with hormone receptor-positiveHER2-negative (HR+ HER2-) metastatic breast cancer. Among 57 mTNBC patientstreated with the carboplatin-paclitaxel or carboplatin-gemcitabine combination,high NLR and PLR were associated with significantly lower PFS at both univariate and multivariable analysis. Conversely, we did not find a significant associationbetween NLR or PLR and the PFS of 148 patients in the control population. Ourfindings suggest that the NLR and PLR are predictive of benefit fromplatinum-containing chemotherapy specifically in mTNBC patients. If validated in larger prospective studies, these easy-to-measure parameters could be combinedwith emerging predictive biomarkers, such as BRCA 1/2 mutations, to improve theselection of mTNBC patients more likely to benefit from platinum-basedchemotherapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27075-z PMCID: PMC5992181PMID: 29880896
