Some preclinical studies havesuggested that systemic GCs might promote survival of estrogen receptor(ER)-negative breast cancer cells. This study aims to clarify their clinicaleffect on patient survival.METHODS: A total of 18,596 women with newly diagnosed stage I-III breast cancerin 2002-2006 were identified from the Taiwan Cancer Database and drug treatmentwas examined from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Claims Database. Of these,3989 who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (non-chemotherapy cohort) and 3237patients who received six cycles of adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy(anthracycline cohort) were included. The impact of GC use on survival wasanalyzed separately in these two cohorts using Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: In the non-chemotherapy cohort, GC use was associated with aggressiveclinicopathological features of breast cancer. High-dose GC was associated withshorter overall survival in univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis.In the anthracycline cohort, multivariate analysis showed that GC use at eachdose level was significantly associated with longer breast cancer-specificsurvival (HR 0.65, 0.70, and 0.70 for low-dose, median-dose, and high-dose GC,respectively) and overall survival (HR 0.72, 0.76, and 0.73, respectively) whencompared with those receiving no GC. The associations were significant in bothER-positive and ER-negative subgroups for breast cancer-specific survival, and inER-negative subgroup for overall survival.CONCLUSION: Concomitant use of GC improved survival in patients receivingadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy for stage I-III breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4787-x PMID: 29761323
