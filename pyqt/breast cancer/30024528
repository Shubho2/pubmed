However, Mycobacteriumfortuitum, a predominant organism, in catheter-associated infections, has rarely been documented in totally implantable venous access port (TVIAP)-associatedbloodstream infections.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 25-year-old woman with breast cancer presented to hospitalwith repeated fever for several days. The patient first refused to remove theTVIAP in her body, and had a relapse of M. fortuitum bacteraemia four monthslater.DIAGNOSES: Bacteria isolated from patient's blood and TVIAP were identified as M.fortuitum by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flightspectrometry and bacterial 16s rDNA sequencing. The patient was diagnosed as aTVIAP-associated bloodstream infection.INTERVENTIONS: The TVIAP was eventually surgically removed, and M. fortuitum was found to have localized on the tip of the catheter. The patient was treated byanti-infection therapy.OUTCOMES: The patient was treated with 4 weeks of intravenous amikacin andlevofloxacin followed by 4 weeks of oral levofloxacin. No episodes of feveroccurred during the follow-up to date.LESSONS: RGM infections remain a challenging issue for TIVAPs. Accurate speciesidentification, timely intravascular catheter removal and appropriate antibiotic therapy are recommended to ensure successful outcomes.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011493 PMID: 30024528  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
