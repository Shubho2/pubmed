Komen, 5005 LBJ Freeway, Suite 526, Dallas, TX75244, USA.Metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is an area with high unmet need across the world. Despite significant progress to meet patient need, current breast cancer (BC)policies fail to recognize the unique challenges of patients who are furtheralong the cancer patient journey. This analysis aims to understand BC/mBC policy development at a global level and identify opportunities for further development.A comprehensive analysis of National Cancer Control Plans (NCCPs) policies andprograms was conducted across 16 countries, which represent a diverse range ofhealthcare systems, economies and geographic regions. Examples of promisingpractices, implemented or initiated by civil society, are provided to demonstratesuccessful methods to address the identified policy gaps. The analysis finds thatdisparities in BC policy development exist across and within countries. Progress in BC policy is fragmented and skewed towards the early part of the patientjourney e.g. awareness and stakeholder education, with key gaps remaining indiagnosis and patient identification. In addition, access to innovative mBCtreatments, ongoing support and palliative care remain a challenge, while carecoordination is limited due to inefficient referrals. Although government andpolicymaker action is fundamental, collaboration between different stakeholdersis imperative to address unmet needs of BC/mBC patients alike. Policy initiativesand promising practices that demonstrate successful multi-stakeholder engagement can be replicated or used to inform further advocacy and policy development with the aim to address patient unmet needs.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
