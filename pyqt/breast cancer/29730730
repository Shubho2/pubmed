Left-sided breast irradiation may involveexposure of the heart to ionising radiation, increasing the risk of ischemicheart disease (IHD). We examined the incidence of IHD in a population-basedcohort of women with DCIS.METHODS: The Breast Cancer DataBase Sweden (BCBase) cohort includes womenregistered with invasive and in situ breast cancers 1992-2012 and age-matchedwomen without a history of breast cancer. In this analysis, 6270 women with DCIS and a comparison cohort of 31,257 women were included. Through linkage withpopulation-based registers, data on comorbidity, socioeconomic status andincidence of IHD was obtained. Hazard ratios (HR) for IHD with 95% confidenceintervals (CI) were analysed.RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 8.8 years. The risk of IHD was not increasedfor women with DCIS versus women in the comparison cohort (HR 0.93; 95% CI0.82-1.06), after treatment with radiotherapy versus surgery alone (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.60-0.98) or when analysing RT by laterality (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.53-1.37 forleft-sided versus right-sided RT).CONCLUSIONS: The risk of IHD was lower for women with DCIS allocated to RTcompared to non-irradiated women and to the comparison cohort, probably due topatient selection. Comparison of RT by laterality did not show any over-risk for irradiation of the left breast.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4803-1 PMID: 29730730
