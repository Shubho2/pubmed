Knowledge of genetic alterations in these tumors will help cliniciansidentify novel therapeutic targets. Understanding the progression pathwaysinvolved in the transition of in situ carcinoma to invasive carcinoma might lead to efficient risk stratification in these patients. The Cancer Genome AnalysisNetwork has collected genomic and epigenomic data to provide comprehensiveinformation regarding carcinogenesis and pathway interactions. Such informationimproves understanding of the disease process and also provides more accurateinformation toward identifying targetable mutations for treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
