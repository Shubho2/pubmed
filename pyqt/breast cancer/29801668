Traditional 3D conformal radiation techniquesoften result in large dose inhomogeneity throughout the treatment volumes,inadequate target coverage, or excessive normal tissue doses. We have developed avolumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) planning technique without enteringthrough the ipsilateral arm that produced adequate target volume coverage,excellent homogeneity throughout the target volume, and acceptable doses to thenormal structures. Twenty left-sided and 10 right-sided patients with eitheripsilateral or bilateral permanent implants or tissue expanders who receivedcomprehensive PMRT between October 2014 and February 2016 were included in thisstudy. Ten left-sided cases used deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) technique,and others used free breathing (FB). Planning target volume (PTV) includedchestwall, internal mammary nodes (IMNs), supraclavicular, and axillary lymphnodes. A VMAT plan using 4 or 5 partial arcs with 6 MV photon beam avoidingentering through the ipsilateral arm was generated for each patient. Prescriptiondose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. PTV coverage, maximum depth of IMNs, dosehomogeneity and dose to the heart, lungs, thyroid, contralateral intact breast orimplant, liver, stomach, left anterior descending artery, ipsilateral brachialplexus, esophagus, spinal cord, and total MU were evaluated. PTV D95% (Gy) was49.6 ± 0.9, 48.7 ± 0.9, and 49.5 ± 1.1; PTV D05% (Gy) was 55.7 ± 0.6, 55.1 ± 1.4,and 55.0 ± 0.7; maximum depth of IMNs (cm) was 4.3 ± 0.9, 4.6 ± 1.1, and4.9 ± 2.3; ipsilateral lung, V20Gy (%) was 29.0 ± 2.1, 28.8 ± 2.5, and27.5 ± 3.4; heart mean dose (Gy) was 4.2 ± 0.4, 7.5 ± 1.1, and 6.6 ± 0.8 forright-sided FB, left-sided FB, and left-sided DIBH cases, respectively. D95% ofIMNs all received 100% prescription dose. The maximum dose (Gy) to the leftanterior descending artery was 33.8 ± 11.7 for left-sided FB and 31.4 ± 7.3 forleft-sided DIBH. VMAT technique avoiding ipsilateral arm can produce acceptableclinical plans for locally advanced breast cancer patients with expander orimplant reconstructions receiving comprehensive PMRT.Copyright © 2018 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists.
