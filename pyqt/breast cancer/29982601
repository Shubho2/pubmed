[Epub ahead of print]Clinicopathologic features and BRCA mutations in primary fallopian tube cancer inJapanese women.Sakurada S(1), Watanabe Y(2)(3), Tokunaga H(1), Takahashi F(3), Yamada H(4),Takehara K(5), Yaegashi N(1).Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.(2)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tohoku Medical and PharmaceuticalUniversity, Sendai, Japan.(3)Clinical Research, Innovation and Education Center, Tohoku UniversityHospital, Sendai, Japan.(4)Department of Gynecology, Miyagi Cancer Center, Sendai, Japan.(5)Department of Gynecology, Shikoku Cancer Center, Matsuyama, Japan.Objective: The present study aimed to clarify the clinicopathological features,including the level of p53 protein expression and BRCA mutations, of primaryfallopian tube cancer (PFTC) in Japanese women.Methods: A multicenter clinical survey was conducted at three Japaneseinstitutions. Clinical data in patients with PFTC between 1998 and 2016 werecollected. Immunohistochemical staining of p53 and BRCA mutation analysis byexome sequence using paraffin-embedded surgical resected specimens wereperformed.Results: A total of 40 patients with PFTC were enrolled in the study. The median age was 58 years (range: 38-78 years); 31 patients were menopausal. Thirty-four(85.0%) patients were diagnosed with serous adenocarcinoma (high grade, 33; lowgrade, 1). PFTC was classified into ampulla type, fimbriae type andundeterminable type by tumor-occupying lesion; ampulla type and fimbriae typeoccurred with the same frequency. Among 30 patients with high-grade serousadenocarcinoma, 6 patients showed germline mutations of BRCA1 (stop-gain 4 andframeshift deletion 2) and 2 patients showed germline mutation of BRCA2(stop-gain 1 and frameshift deletion 1). However, only 1 patient had familialhistory of breast or ovarian cancer. Patients with BRCA mutations in the germlinewere frequently observed in ampulla type and FIGO stage I/II cancers, but nosignificant difference in the frequency of p53 overexpression and overallsurvival was observed.Conclusions: Among Japanese patients with PFTC, 26.7% presented with BRCAmutations in the germline. Additionally, p53 was important for the carcinogenesisin fallopian tubes, independent of the specific BRCA mutation.DOI: 10.1093/jjco/hyy095 PMID: 29982601
