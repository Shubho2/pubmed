The existing machine learningmethods suffer from the imbalanced sample issue because the number of knowndisease genes (positive samples) is much less than that of unknown genes whichare typically considered to be negative samples. In addition, most methods havenot utilized clinical data from patients with a specific disease to predictdisease genes. In this study, we propose a disease gene prediction algorithm(called dgSeq) by combining protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, clinicalRNA-Seq data, and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIN) data. Our dgSeqconstructs differential networks based on rewiring information calculated fromclinical RNA-Seq data. To select balanced sets of non-disease genes (negativesamples), a disease-gene network is also constructed from OMIM data. Afterfeatures are extracted from the PPI networks and differential networks, thelogistic regression classifiers are trained. Our dgSeq obtains AUC values of0.88, 0.83 and 0.80 for identifying breast cancer genes, thyroid cancer genes andAlzheimer's disease genes, respectively, which indicates its superiority to otherthree competing methods. Both gene set enrichment analysis and predicted results demonstrate that dgSeq can effectively predict new disease genes.DOI: 10.1109/TCBB.2017.2770120 PMID: 29990218
