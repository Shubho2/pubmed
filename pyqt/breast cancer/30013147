How tumors shape human DCs is unknown. Here we used RNA-based next-generation sequencing to systematicallyanalyze the transcriptomes of plasmacytoid pre-DCs (pDCs), cell populationsenriched for type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s), type 2 conventional DCs (cDC2s),CD14+ DCs and monocytes-macrophages from human primary luminal breast cancer(LBC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). By comparing tumor tissue withnon-invaded tissue from the same patient, we found that 85% of the genesupregulated in DCs in LBC were specific to each DC subset. However, all DCsubsets in TNBC commonly showed enrichment for the interferon pathway, but those in LBC did not. Finally, we defined transcriptional signatures specific for tumorDC subsets with a prognostic effect on their respective breast-cancer subtype. Weconclude that the adjustment of DCs to the tumor microenvironment is subsetspecific and can be used to predict disease outcome. Our work also provides aresource for the identification of potential targets and biomarkers that mightimprove antitumor therapies.DOI: 10.1038/s41590-018-0145-8 PMID: 30013147
