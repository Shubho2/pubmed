The efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosinekinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) against brain metastases from EGFRmutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed promising antitumoractivity, on the other hand, the main treatment of breast cancer brain metastases(BCBMs) is only local therapy such as surgery or radiotherapy. The goal oftreatment includes stabilizing or improving neurological function and palliating neurological symptom. In addition, the breast cancer subtype appears to beassociated with the incident and the prognosis of brain metastases. And more,BCBMs have various faces such as brain parenchymal metastases, leptomeningealcarcinomatoses and intracranial dural metastases. Needless to say, for thesemetastases the early diagnosis and the appropriate therapeutic approach for anindividual patient should be considered. This review described neurologicalmanagement and therapeutic decisions of BCBM in consideration the subtype andshowed representative MRI images.DOI: 10.21037/cco.2018.05.06 PMID: 30056732
