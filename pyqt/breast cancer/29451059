In Oncokompas, cancer survivors monitor their quality of life bycompleting patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), followed by personalizedfeedback, self-care advice, and supportive care options to stimulate patientactivation. The aim of this study was to investigate feasibility andpretest-posttest differences of Oncokompas including a newly developed breastcancer (BC) module among BC survivors.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A pretest-posttest design was used. Feasibility wasinvestigated by means of adoption, usage, and satisfaction rates. Severalsocio-demographic and clinical factors, and health-related quality of life(HRQOL) were explored that might be associated with patient satisfaction.Barriers and facilitators of Oncokompas feasibility were investigated byevaluating nurse consultation reports. Differences in patient activation (PatientActivation Measure) and patient-physician interaction (Perceived Efficacy inPatient-Physician Interactions) before and after Oncokompas use wereinvestigated.RESULTS: In total, 101 BC survivors participated. Oncokompas had an adoption rateof 75%, a usage rate of 75-84%, a mean satisfaction score of 6.9 (range 0-10) anda Net Promoter Score (NPS) of -36 (range -100-100) (N = 68). The BC module had a mean satisfaction score of 7.6. BC survivors who received surgery includingchemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were significantly more satisfied withOncokompas than BC survivors with surgery alone (p = .013). Six facilitators and 10 barriers of Oncokompas feasibility were identified. After using Oncokompas, BCsurvivors scored significantly higher on patient activation (p = .007; r = .24), but not on patient-physician interaction (p = .75).CONCLUSION: Oncokompas including a BC module is considered feasible, but needsfurther optimization to increase user satisfaction. This study shows the value oftailoring eHealth applications for cancer survivors to their specific tumor type.Oncokompas including the BC module seems to improve patient activation among BCsurvivors.DOI: 10.1080/0284186X.2018.1438654 PMID: 29451059
