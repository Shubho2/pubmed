Development of new treatmentstrategies would benefit from an expanded repertoire of in vitro cell culturesystems, such as those that support tridimensional growth in the presence ofhydrogel scaffolds. To this end, we established protocols for maintenance of the TNBC cell line HCC70 in monolayer culture and in a commercially availablebasement membrane matrix hydrogel. We evaluated the general morphology of cellsgrown in both conditions with light microscopy, and examined their subcellularorganization using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Phase contrast andconfocal microscopy showed the prevalence of irregularly shaped flattened cellsin monolayer cultures, while cells maintained in hydrogel organized intomulti-layered spheroids. A quantitative ultrastructural analysis comparing cells from the two culture conditions revealed that cells that formed spheroidscomprised a greater number of mitochondria, autophagic vacuoles and intercellularjunctions than their monolayer counterparts, within the equivalent area ofsampled tissue. These observations suggest that triple negative breast cancercells in culture can alter their organelle content, as well as their morphology, in response to their microenvironment. Methods presented here may be useful forthose who intend to image cell cultures with TEM, and for investigators who seek to implement diverse in vitro models in the search for therapeutic moleculartargets for TNBC.DOI: 10.7717/peerj.4340 PMCID: PMC5817938PMID: 29473000
