nature of the BRCA2 c.68-7T > A variant has beendemonstrated, its association with cancer risk remains controversial. In thisstudy, we accurately quantified by real-time PCR and digital PCR (dPCR), theBRCA2 isoforms retaining or missing exon 3. In addition, the combined odds ratio for causality of the variant was estimated using genetic and clinical data, andits associated cancer risk was estimated by case-control analysis in 83,636individuals. Co-occurrence in trans with pathogenic BRCA2 variants was assessedin 5,382 families. Exon 3 exclusion rate was 4.5-fold higher in variant carriers (13%) than controls (3%), indicating an exclusion rate for the c.68-7T > A alleleof approximately 20%. The posterior probability of pathogenicity was7.44 × 10-115 . There was neither evidence for increased risk of breast cancer(OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.86-1.24) nor for a deleterious effect of the variant whenco-occurring with pathogenic variants. Our data provide for the first time robustevidence of the nonpathogenicity of the BRCA2 c.68-7T > A. Genetic andquantitative transcript analyses together inform the threshold for the ratiobetween functional and altered BRCA2 isoforms compatible with normal cellfunction. These findings might be exploited to assess the relevance for cancerrisk of other BRCA2 spliceogenic variants.© 2018 The Authors.
