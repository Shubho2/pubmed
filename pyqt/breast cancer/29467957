Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity was significantly high but manageable in gemcitabine-basedgroups. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with first-linegemcitabine-based chemotherapy had better OS (HR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.32),PFS (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.27), and ORR (RR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.32).In addition, additional gemcitabine chemotherapy also showed better OS (HR =1.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.30), PFS (HR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.30) and ORR (RR =1.23, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.42) than gemcitabine replacement therapy. Furthermore,patients receiving gemcitabine-taxanes-based regimens had better OS (HR = 1.17,95% CI 1.06 to 1.28), PFS (HR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.20) and ORR (RR = 1.17,95% CI 1.01 to 1.35) than patients with non-gemcitabine-taxanes-basedchemotherapy. These findings indicate that gemcitabine combination regimens couldserve as a promising regimen for ABC patients, though increased hematologictoxicity should be considered with caution.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23426 PMCID: PMC5805543PMID: 29467957
