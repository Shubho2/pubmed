[Epub ahead of print]Risk of Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Diagnoses Among HIV-InfectedIndividuals in the United States.Coghill AE(1), Engels EA(1), Schymura MJ(2), Mahale P(1), Shiels MS(1).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute,National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.(2)New York State Cancer Registry.Background: Although people living with HIV or AIDS (PLWHA) are at higher riskfor many cancers, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates are lower in thispatient population. Because these tumors are often screen-detected, these inverseassociations could be driven by HIV-related differences in utilization of cancer screening.Methods: We ascertained incident breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer in PLWHAusing data from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study (1996-2012). Comparisons withgeneral population cancer rates were made using standardized incidence ratios(SIRs), overall and stratified by tumor stage/size, breast cancer estrogenreceptor status, and colorectal site. We also examined the potential effect ofstudy design and unmeasured confounding on inverse standardized incidence ratios.Results: Compared with the general population, PLWHA had lower rates of invasive breast (SIR = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58 to 0.68), prostate (SIR =0.48, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.51), proximal colon (SIR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.59 to 0.75),distal colon (SIR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.59), and rectal cancers (SIR = 0.69,95% CI = 0.61 to 0.77). Reduced risk persisted across tumor stage/size forprostate and colorectal cancers. Although distant-stage breast cancer rates were not reduced (SIR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.73 to 1.20), HIV-infected women had lowerrates of large (>5 cm) breast tumors (SIR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.50 to 0.83). Themagnitude of these inverse standardized incidence ratios could not plausibly beattributed to case underascertainment, out-migration, or unmeasured confounding.Conclusions: Breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates are markedly loweramong PLWHA, including rates of distant-stage/large tumors that are not generallyscreen-detected. This set of inverse HIV-cancer associations is thereforeunlikely to be due primarily to differential screening and may instead represent biological relationships requiring future investigation.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy010 PMID: 29529223
