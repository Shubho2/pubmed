Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), ahistone deacetylase inhibitor, has been shown to work synergistically withpaclitaxel in vitro and in preclinical studies. In addition, our laboratory hasdemonstrated that SAHA treatment decreases paclitaxel-associated stem celltoxicity, modulates inflammatory response, and promotes wound healing in injured fibroblast cells. Our goal was to determine if combined SAHA and paclitaxeltreatment would improve wound healing in an in vivo full-thickness murine model, without altering antitumor effect.METHODS: Thirty-two nude athymic mice received intraperitoneal injections ofpaclitaxel (20 mg/kg), SAHA (25 mg/kg), paclitaxel + SAHA (20 mg/kg + 25 mg/kg), or no treatment for 2 weeks prior to surgery. Under general anesthesia, 8-mmfull-thickness dorsal wounds were created in all animals, and a silicone splintwas attached to minimize wound contraction. The wounds were measured twice a weekwith a surgical caliper until healing was complete. To evaluate the in vivoeffect of drug treatment, 16 athymic nude mice with MDA-MB-231 xenograftsreceived the treatments described previously, following which tumor volumes were compared between groups.RESULTS: Average wound healing time was prolonged in mice treated with paclitaxel(20 ± 1.9 days), and combination SAHA + paclitaxel therapy improved average woundhealing time (17.0 ± 1.8 days). In the xenograft model, the antitumor effect ofSAHA and paclitaxel (average tumor volume 43.9 ± 34.1 mm) was greater thanpaclitaxel alone (105.8 ± 73.8 mm).CONCLUSIONS: The addition of SAHA to taxane chemotherapy improves the therapeuticeffect on triple-negative breast cancer while decreasing the detrimental effectof paclitaxel on wound healing. This may have substantial implications onimproving outcomes in breast reconstruction following chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001519 PMID: 29905606
