We assessed AR mRNAexpression in 925 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 136 tumors in 2confirmation sets. AR protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistryin 197 tumors from a multi-institutional cohort, for a total of 1258 patientsanalyzed. Cox hazard ratios were used to determine correlations to PAM50 breastcancer subtypes, and TNBC subtypes. Overall, AR-negative patients are diagnosedat a younger age compared to AR-positive patients, with the average age of AAAR-negative patients being, 49. AA breast tumors express AR at lower ratescompared to Whites, independent of ER and PR expression (p<0.0001). AR-negativepatients have a (66.60; 95% CI, 32-146) odds ratio of being basal-like comparedto other PAM50 subtypes, and this is associated with an increased time toprogression and decreased overall survival. AA "QNBC" patients predominatelydemonstrated BL1, BL2 and IM subtypes, with differential expression of E2F1,NFKBIL2, CCL2, TGFB3, CEBPB, PDK1, IL12RB2, IL2RA, and SOS1 genes compared towhite patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 weresignificantly upregulated in both overall "QNBC" and AA "QNBC" patients as well. Thus, AR could be used as a prognostic marker for breast cancer, particularly in AA "QNBC" patients.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196909 PMCID: PMC6005569PMID: 29912871
