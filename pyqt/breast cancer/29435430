The purpose of this study was to develop andevaluate LC gel formulations to deliver the anti-cancer drug exemestane throughtransdermal route. Methods: Two LC gel formulations were prepared by phaseseparation coacervation method using glyceryl monooleate (GMO), Tween 80 andPluronic® F127 (F127). The formulations were characterized with regard toencapsulation efficiency (EE), vesicle size, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)spectroscopy, surface morphology (using light and fluorescence microscopy), invitro release, ex vivo permeation, in vitro effectiveness test on MDA-MB231cancer cell lines and histopathological analysis. Results: Results exhibited thatthe EE was 85%-92%, vesicle size was 119.9-466.2 nm while morphology showedspherical vesicles after hydration. An FTIR result also revealed that there wasno significant shift in peaks corresponding to Exemestane and excipients. LCformulations release the drug from cellulose acetate and Strat-MTM membrane from 15%-88.95%, whereas ex vivo permeation ranges from 37.09-63%. The in vitroeffectiveness study indicated that even at low exemestane concentrations (12.5and 25 μg/mL) the formulations were able to induce cancer cell death, regardless of the surfactant used. Histopathological analysis thinning of the epidermis asthe formulations penetrate into the intercellular regions of squamous cells.Conclusion: The results conjectured that exemestane could be incorporated into LCgels for the transdermal delivery system and further preclinical studies such as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies will be carried out with suitableanimal models.DOI: 10.15171/bi.2017.27 PMCID: PMC5801534PMID: 29435430
