Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has proven to behighly effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, nightsweats, dyspareunia, sexual disorders, and insomnia and in preventingosteoporosis. According to preclinical data, estrogen and progesterone aresupposed to be involved in the induction and progression of breast andendometrial cancers. Similarly, in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), thepathogenesis seems to be at least partly hormonally influenced. Is HRT ingynecological cancer survivors possible? The literature data are controversial.Many clinicians remain reluctant to prescribe HRT for these patients due to thefear of relapse and the risk to develop coronary heart disease or breast cancer. Before the decision to use HRT an accurate counselling should be mandatory inorder to individualizing on the basis of potential risks and benefits, including a close follow-up. Nevertheless, we do believe that with strong informed consent doctors may individually consider to prescribe some course of HRT in order tominimize menopausal symptoms and disease related to hormonal reduction.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
