The regional LN status is asignificant determinant of cancer stage and patient prognosis, and stronglyinfluences treatment. Regional LN dissection has become a part of surgicaltreatment. However, not all patients with LN involvement benefit from extensivelymphadenectomy in terms of prolonged survival. Moreover, overtreatment ofpatients with localized disease carries the unnecessary risk of complications. Itis believed that sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) allows to assess the involvement ofthe most representative LN of the lymphatic basin and to decide on radical LNdissection.99mTc is an easily available radionuclide emitting gamma rays. Thevalue of 99mTc for diagnostic procedures is associated with its relatively short half-life that makes it safe both for patients and medical personnel. A colloidpresenting specific physical and biological properties, including optimalparticle size, is a carrier for the radionuclide. When administered at the tumor site, a radiocolloid is absorbed by the lymphatics, and the first LN that it getstrapped in is referred to as the sentinel LN (SLN). The radiopharmaceutical must reach the SLN relatively quickly, but its storage within the SLN, and theradionuclide's half-life must be long enough to enable intraoperative imaging andevaluation. SLNB is currently the gold standard in breast cancer and malignantmelanoma diagnosis, and is under extensive investigation in gynecologicalcancers. Here, we provide a historical perspective of the SLN concept and theclinical relevance of SLNB in gynecologic oncology. Moreover, we review thetechnical aspects of the application of 99mTc-based radiopharmaceuticals inlymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative lymphatic mapping.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1381612824666180515122150 PMID: 29766779
