Here, we focused on anassociation between an inflammation marker, C-reactive-protein (CRP), and global DNA methylation levels of peripheral blood leukocytes.METHODS: The subjects were 384 healthy Japanese women enrolled as the controlgroup of a case-control study for breast cancer conducted from 2001 to 2005.Global DNA methylation was quantified by Luminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA).RESULTS: With adjustment for lifestyle-related factors, including folate intake, the global DNA methylation level of peripheral blood leukocytes was significantlybut weakly increased by 0.43% per quartile category for CRP (P fortrend = 0.010). Estimated methylation levels stratified by CRP quartile were70.0%, 70.8%, 71.4%, and 71.3%, respectively. In addition, interaction betweenpolymorphism of MTHFR (rs1801133, known as C677T) and CRP was significant (P for interaction = 0.046); the global methylation level was significantly increased by0.61% per quartile category for CRP in the CT/TT group (those with the minorallele T, P for trend = 0.001), whereas no association was observed in the CCgroup (wild type).CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that CRP concentration is weakly associated with global DNA methylation level. However, this association was observed more clearlyin individuals with the minor allele of the MTHFR missense SNP rs1801133. Byelucidating the complex mechanism of the regulation of DNA methylation by bothacquired and genetic factors, our results may be important for cancer prevention.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4089-z PMCID: PMC5812223PMID: 29439678
