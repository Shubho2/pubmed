However, without reconstruction, asymmetry of the breast occurs due to the tissue defect andradiation fibrosis, producing in poor cosmetic results. In this case study, weperformed staged prosthetic breast reconstruction combined with fat grafting for severe depressive deformation of the breast after breast-conserving therapy. The first surgery involved insertion of a tissue expander and fat grafting, secondsurgery was the reduction of injected saline volume and fat grafting, and thirdsurgery involved exchange for an implant and fat grafting. The skin in thedepressed area, which had atrophied, became soft and flexible; deformation wasalso improved, and the patient was satisfied with the aesthetic outcome. It isexpected that fat grafting will fertilize and qualitatively improve the damagedtissue due to irradiation, reducing the complications related to the tissueexpander and implant. We believe that it will be possible to correct a breastdeformity after breast-conserving therapy using a tissue expander and implant,which had not been considered as a solution. The results showed that the present method can be an option for delayed reconstruction after breast-conservingtherapy.DOI: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000001717 PMCID: PMC5908493PMID: 29707467
