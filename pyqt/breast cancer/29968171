Inparticular, G-CSF mobilizes neutrophils when the host is challenged by infection or tissue damage. Severe neutropenia, or febrile neutropenia is alife-threatening event that can be mitigated by administration of G-CSF.Consequently, G-CSF has been used to support patients undergoing chemotherapy whowould otherwise require dose reduction due to neutropenia. Over the past10-15Â years it has become increasingly apparent, in preclinical tumour growth andmetastasis models, that G-CSF can support tumour progression by mobilization oftumour-associated neutrophils which consequently promote tumour dissemination andmetastasis. With the increasing use of G-CSF in the clinic, it is pertinent toask if there is any evidence of a similar promotion of tumour progression inpatients. Here, we have reviewed the preclinical and clinical data on thepotential contribution of G-CSF to tumour progression. We conclude that, whilstthe evidence for a promotion of metastasis is strong in preclinical models andthat limited data indicate that high serum G-CSF levels in patients areassociated with poorer prognosis, no studies published so far have revealedevidence of increased tumour progression associated with supportive G-CSF useduring chemotherapy in patients. Analysis of G-CSF receptor positive cohortswithin supportive trials, as well as studies of the role of G-CSF blockade inappropriate tumours in the absence of chemotherapy could yield clinicallytranslatable findings.DOI: 10.1007/s10585-018-9917-7 PMID: 29968171
