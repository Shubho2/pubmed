Email: mrana.masroor@aku.eduObjective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of “X- rayexamination of surgically resected specimen‘‘ in assessing complete localexcision (CLE). Materials and Methods: In this retrospective cross sectionalstudy, data were collected for all female breast cancer cases who underwentbreast-conserving surgery after needle localization of mammographically visibledisease. Males, patients with mammographically invisible disease and cases withbenign or inconclusive histopathology, those undergoing modified radicalmastectomy and individuals with dense breast parenchyma were excluded. Weevaluated radiography of resected specimens to assess margin spiculation,distance of mass/microcalcification from the excised margin, presence of a mass, and presence of any adjacent microcalcification, Other features including masssize, nuclear grade and patient’s age were also recorded and all were analyzedfor any association with CLE. Results: Absence of adjacent microcalcification andthe presence of a mass on radiographs showed significant associations with CLE,but no links were evident with other features. Specimen radiography was found to be a sufficient tool to predict CLE with a positive predictive value of 83.3%, a sensitivity of 80.7% and a specificity of 81%. Conclusion: Specimen radiographyis an important and sensitive tool to predict CLE.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.3.763 PMCID: PMC5980853PMID: 29582632
