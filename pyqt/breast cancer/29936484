The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between CEUScharacteristics and pathological prognostic factors.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study with 34 malignant breast lesions was conducted. CEUS characteristics included qualitative characteristics (e.g.lesion's enhancement degree and order, internal lesion homogeneity etc.) andquantitative characteristics (e.g. peak intensity, time to peak etc.). Also,pathological prognostic factors were included (e.g. tumor grade, estrogenreceptor status etc.).RESULTS: Blurred lesion margins were observed more often in tumors of highhistological grade (p=0.01) and in estrogen receptor-negative tumors (p=0.049).Furthermore, perilesional enhancement was associated with positive Ki-67expression (p=0.049), while heterogeneous internal sentinel lymph nodeenhancement was associated with malignant infiltration of the node (p=0.002).CONCLUSION: CEUS has the potential to provide a prevision of pathologicalprognostic factors in malignant breast lesions, helping in the better earlypatient management.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11333 PMID: 29936484
