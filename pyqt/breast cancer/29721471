Severalfeatures contribute to the importance of the bone environment in the managementof breast cancer. Firstly, bone metastases represent the most common site ofbreast cancer metastases and secondly, the emergence of cancer treatment-induced bone loss (CTIBL) among breast cancer survivors and patients is of increasingconcern. In the adjuvant setting, bisphosphonates can be given to prevent andtreat tumor therapy-induced bone loss in premenopausal and postmenopausal womenand, owing to their beneficial effect on bone turnover, have also been evaluated for prevention of bone metastases occurrence. Expert oncologists discusses on theupdate on the approaches of Bone-modifying Agents and its treatment options. Thisexpert group used data from published literature, practical experience andopinion of a large group of academic oncologists to arrive at this practicalconsensus recommendations for the benefit of community oncologists.DOI: 10.4103/sajc.sajc_109_18 PMCID: PMC5909303PMID: 29721471
