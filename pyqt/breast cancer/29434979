The aim of the present study was toevaluate the methylation status of the LATS2 promoter region using bisulfitesequencing with a next generation sequencer for breast cancer. In the 11 patientsenrolled in the present study, the LATS2 promoter methylation index (MI) wasuniformly high in tumor and normal tissues of the breast (median, 84.0 and 87.4%,respectively). The presence of LATS2 promoter hypermethylation was confirmed inisolated tumor cells and normal epithelial cells using the magnetic-activatedcell sorting method. In situ hybridization for LATS2 messenger RNA (mRNA)revealed that the mRNA expression of LATS2 was higher in normal epithelial cells,compared with tumor cells, however, it was not significantly associated withLATS2 MI. In 12 breast cancer cell (BCC) lines and two normal breast cell lines, the LATS2 promoter was uniformly hypermethylated with no correlation between the mRNA expression of LATS2 and the LATS2 MI. In addition, treatment of the BCClines with a demethylating reagent had minimal effect on the mRNA expression ofLATS2 in any of these cell lines. These results demonstrated that LATS2hypermethylation was not involved in silencing the mRNA expression of LATS2 mRNA.The lower mRNA expression level of LATS2 in tumor cells, compared with normalepithelial cells, suggested the possible involvement of downregulation in themRNA expression of LATS2 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Therefore, theconflicting results previously reported for LATS2 promoter methylation indifferent types of cancer, detected using MSP assays may be attributable to thelow fidelity of the MSP assay.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7535 PMCID: PMC5777308PMID: 29434979
