Nimbolide, an active chemical constituent of neem (Azadirachta indica) exhibits potentanticancer effects. Although, nimbolide mediated apoptosis activation in breastcancer cells is well known. Nevertheless, its role in autophagy inductionmechanism and epigenetic alteration is not explored previously. Our current studyintended to bridge the gaps in the existing research by exploring the potentialof nimbolide in inducing autophagy, which could counter regulate thetransformations in breast cancer. In our studies, nimbolide significantlyinhibited the cell proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with IC50 valuesof 1.97 ± 0.24 and 5.04 ± 0.25 μM, respectively. Nimbolide markedly arrested the cell cycle progression and cell survival with loss of mitochondrial membranepotential by reducing Bcl-2 concomitantly inducing Bax and caspases proteinexpression with modulation of HDAC-2 and H3K27Ac expression. Consequently,characteristic autophagolysosome accumulation was observed by acridine orange,monodansylcadaverine (MDC) and Lysotracker Red staining. Moreover, nimbolideinduced autophagy signaling by increasing Beclin 1 and LC3B along with decreased p62 and mTOR protein expression. Thus, our findings imply that nimbolide induces autophagy mediated apoptotic cell death in breast cancer with epigeneticmodifications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
