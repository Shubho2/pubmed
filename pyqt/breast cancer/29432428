Sera from 117preoperative/pretreatment breast cancer patients and 51 control subjects,including those with fibrocystic disease, were analyzed for the presence of PLAC1protein as well as its expression by IHC in tumor biopsies in a subset ofsubjects. Serum PLAC1 levels exceeded the mean plus one standard deviation(mean+SD) of the level in control subjects in 67% of subjects with ductalcarcinoma in situ (DCIS), 67% with HER2+ tumors, 73% with triple-negative cancer and 73% with ER+/PR+ tumors. Greater sensitivity was achieved using the mean+2 SDof control PLAC1 serum values, where the false positive rate was 3% and wasexceeded by 38%, 40%, 60% and 43% of subjects with DCIS, HER2+, TNBC andER+/PR+/HER2- tumors. PLAC1 was detected in 97% of tumor biopsies, but did notcorrelate quantitatively with serum levels. There was no significant correlation of serum PLAC1 levels with race, age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI) or thepresence of metastatic disease. It remains to be determined whether PLAC1 serumlevels can serve as a diagnostic biomarker for the presence or recurrence ofdisease post-surgery and/or therapy.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0192106 PMCID: PMC5809008PMID: 29432428  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
