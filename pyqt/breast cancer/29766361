However, the promoters of the breast cancer (BC) genes are notregularly screened. Our goal was to investigate the BRCA2 promoter in order tostudy a possible correlation between impaired transcription and disease.METHODS: The proximal and core promoter of the BRCA2 gene was sequenced in 95high-risk BC patients. A BRCA2-promoter insert [- 938 to + 312 from thetranscription start site (TSS)] was generated and cloned into the fireflyluciferase vector pGL4.10. Promoter variants and deletions were introduced bysite-directed mutagenesis and quantified by Dual-Luciferase assays andsemi-quantitative RT-PCR.RESULTS: Three different variants were detected in high-risk BC patients:rs3092989, rs206118, and rs563971900. Functional mapping of 13 overlappingdeletions revealed four down-regulating segments (TSS positions):-59_-10del/µdel3 (16% of activity of the wild-type construct), -104_-55del/µdel4 (62%), -239_-190del/µdel7 (39%), -464_-415/µdel12 (78%), suggesting the presence therein of putative transcriptional activator motifs. Additionally, sixmicrodeletions rendered luciferase overexpression: +32_+81del/µdel1 (356%),-14_+36del/µdel2 (180%), -194_-145del/µdel6 (154%), -284_-235del/µdel8 (168%),-329_-280del/µdel9 (111%), and -509_-460del/µdel13 (139%), which is indicative ofrepressor elements. Functional assays of 15 promoter variants (including thosedetected in patients) showed that ten of them significantly altered expressionwith seven up-regulating (113-163%) and three down-regulating (rs551887850_G,rs570548398_T, rs55880202_T; 72-83%) SNPs. Eight of them were located in anENCODE-DNase Hypersensitive Cluster (TSS - 185 to + 105) where most activetranscriptional motifs are known to be placed.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA2 expression is highly sensitive to promoter variations as most of them induced relevant changes. Moreover, we mapped critical regions of theBRCA2 promoter that may constitute potential targets for regulatory variants.Three SNPs moderately decreased luciferase activity, but confirmation of itspotential pathogenicity requires further analysis. These data reinforce the need to screen the promoter regions of breast cancer genes with a view to discovering novel deleterious mutations.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4826-7 PMID: 29766361
