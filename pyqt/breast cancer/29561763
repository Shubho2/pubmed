There is a clinical need for effective, targeted therapystrategies that destroy both differentiated TNBC cells and TNBC cancer initiatingcells (CICs), as the latter are implicated in the metastasis and recurrence ofTNBC. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) is overexpressed ondifferentiated tumor cells and CICs obtained from TNBC patient specimens,suggesting that CSPG4 may be a clinically relevant target for the imaging andtherapy of TNBC. The purpose of this study was to determine whether α-particleradioimmunotherapy (RIT) targeting TNBC cells using the CSPG4-specific monoclonalantibody (mAb) 225.28 as a carrier was effective at eliminating TNBC tumors inpreclinical models. To this end, mAb 225.28 labeled with 212Pb (212Pb-225.28) as a source of α-particles for RIT was used for in vitro Scatchard assays andclonogenic survival assays with human TNBC cells (SUM159 and 2LMP) grown asadherent cells or non-adherent CIC-enriched mammospheres. Immune-deficient micebearing orthotopic SUM159 or 2LMP xenografts were injected i.v. with the targeted(225.28) or irrelevant isotype-matched control (F3-C25) mAbs, labeled with 99mTc,125I, or 212Pb for in vivo imaging, biodistribution, or tumor growth inhibitionstudies. 212Pb-225.28 bound to adherent SUM159 and 2LMP cells and to CICs fromSUM159 and 2LMP mammospheres with a mean affinity of 0.5 nM. Nearly ten timesmore binding sites per cell were present on SUM159 cells and CICs compared with2LMP cells. 212Pb-225.28 was six to seven times more effective than 212Pb-F3-C25 at inhibiting SUM159 cell and CIC clonogenic survival (p < 0.05). RadiolabeledmAb 225.28 showed significantly higher uptake than radiolabeled mAb F3-C25 inSUM159 and 2LMP xenografts (p < 0.05), and the uptake of 212Pb-225.28 in TNBCxenografts was correlated with target epitope expression. 212Pb-225.28 causeddose-dependent growth inhibition of SUM159 xenografts; 0.30 MBq 212Pb-225.28 was significantly more effective than 0.33 MBq 212Pb-F3-C25 at inhibiting tumorgrowth (p < 0.01). These results suggest that CSPG4-specific 212Pb-225.28 is auseful reagent for RIT of CSPG4-expressing tumors, including metastatic TNBC.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19040925 PMCID: PMC5979285PMID: 29561763
