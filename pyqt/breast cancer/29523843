BST-2 employs its pro-tumoreffects through the formation of BST-2:BST-2 dimers which ultimately promotescell to cell and cell to matrix adhesion, cell motility, survival, and growth.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a novel BST-2-basedpeptide-B49 on adhesion and growth of breast cancer cells. Homotypic/heterotypic adhesion, three-dimensional spheroid formation, and anchorage-independent growth were used to assess the effect of B49 on cell adhesion and growth. Additionally, we provide evidence of the anti-tumor effect of B49 in a preclinical mouse model of breast cancer. Results show that breast cancer cell adhesion to other cancercells or components of the tumor microenvironment were inhibited by B49. Mostwell-known evaluation indexes of cancer cell growth, including spheroidformation, anchorage-independent, and primary tumor growth were significantlyinhibited by B49. These data affirm that i) BST-2 plays a key role in mediatingbreast cancer cell adhesion and growth, and ii) B49 and its analog B49Mod1significantly inhibits BST-2-mediated cancer cell adhesion and growth. Therefore,B49 and its analogs offer a promising anti-adhesion and therapeutic lead forBST-2-dependent cancers.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22364-z PMCID: PMC5844955PMID: 29523843
