Because cancer stem cells (CSC) are responsible of sustaining the metastatic spread of the disease to distalorgans and the progressive gain of resistance of advanced cancers, new anticancertherapies should be validated specifically for this subpopulation of cells. A newamphihilic-based gene delivery system that combines Pluronic® F127 micelles with polyplexes spontaneously formed by electrostatic interaction between anionicsiRNA and cationic polyethylenimine (PEI) 10K, was designed (PM). Resultant PMgather the requirements for an efficient and safe transport of siRNA in terms of its physicochemical characteristics, internalization capacity, toxicity profileand silencing efficacy. PM were loaded with a siRNA against AKT2, an importantoncogene involved in breast cancer tumorigenesis, with a special role in CSCmalignancy. Efficacy of siAKT2-PM was validated in CSC isolated from two breastcancer cell lines: MCF-7 and Triple Negative MDA-MB-231 corresponding to anaggressive subtype of breast cancer. In both cases, we observed significantreduction on cell invasion capacity and strong inhibition of mammosphereformation after treatment. These results prompt AKT2 inhibition as a powerfultherapeutic target against CSC and pave the way to the appearance of moreeffective nanomedicine-based gene therapies aimed to prevent CSC-related tumorrecurrence.DOI: 10.1080/10717544.2018.1461276 PMID: 29667444
