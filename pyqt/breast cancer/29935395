The most commonof these, and the subject of this work, is high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma(HGSC).METHODS: In this population-based study we identified a cohort of 441,382 womenresident in Western Australia who had ever been admitted to hospital in theState. Of these, 454 were diagnosed with HGSC. We used Cox regression to derivehazard ratios (HRs) comparing the risk of disease in women who had each of arange of medical diagnoses and surgical procedures with women who did not.RESULTS: We found an increased risk of HGSC associated with a diagnosis of pelvicinflammatory disease (PID) (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.04-2.07) but not with a diagnosisof infertility or endometriosis with HRs of 1.12 (95% CI 0.73-1.71) and 0.82 (95%CI 0.55-1.22) respectively. A personal history of breast cancer was associatedwith a three-fold increase in the rate of HGSC. Increased parity was associatedwith a reduced risk of HGSC in women without a personal history of breast cancer (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.44-0.73), but not in women with a personal history of breastcancer (HR 1.48; 95% CI 0.74-2.95).CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of an increased risk of HGSC associated with PID lendssupport to the hypothesis that inflammatory processes may be involved in theetiology of HGSC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
