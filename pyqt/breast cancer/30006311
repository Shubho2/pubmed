However, the development of mitochondria-targeting ligands isdifficult because of the low permeability of the mitochondrial double membrane.We found that hypericin (HY), a natural product isolated from Hypericumperforatum L., is an effective mitochondria-targeting ligand. HY-functionalizedgraphene oxide (GO) loaded with doxorubicin (GO-PEG-SS-HY/DOX) increased thesynergistic anticancer efficacy of phototherapy and chemotherapy in the absenceof apparent adverse side effects. In vitro and in vivo assays suggestedGO-PEG-SS-HY/DOX induced the expression of the key proteins of themitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway and caused apoptosis of breast carcinoma cells. In addition, GO vehicle exhibited low toxicity toward normal cells,indicating high safety of functionalized GO preparations in antitumor therapy.Therefore, HY-functionalized GO can be successfully used as a platform technologyto target mitochondria in cancer cells and improve the therapeutic efficacy ofchemotherapeutic drugs.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Induction ofmitochondria-mediated apoptosis is a promising approach in cancer therapy.However, mitochondria are difficult to access and permeate because of theirnegative membrane potential and highly dense double membrane.Mitochondria-targeting ligands can be conjugated to nanoparticles orsmall-molecule drugs to enhance their antitumor effect. Here, we showed that the natural photosensitizer hypericin is a novel mitochondria-targeting ligand andthat graphene oxide particles co-loaded with hypericin and the chemotherapeuticagent doxorubicin exhibited a synergistic antitumor effect mediated by themitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Treatment with such particles in combinationwith laser irradiation led to apoptosis of the tumor MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cellsin vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, treatment withhypericin/doxorubicin-functionalized graphene oxide had low cellular toxicity.Copyright Â© 2018 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
