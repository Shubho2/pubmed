The total extract was then partitioned into four fractions including chloroform, ethylacetate and methanol. Cytotoxic effect of fractions was examined by MTT assay in K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), AGS (gastric adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) and SW742 (colon adenocarcinoma) cell lines. The Chloroformfraction, with the lowest LC50 against K-562 cell lines, was partitioned into 14 subfractions and subjected to further purification by reversed-phase (C18) silicagel and sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. Three flavonoids includingcirsimaritin, cirsilinelol and eupatilin were isolated for the first time fromthe species and the structures were confirmed by spectroscopic data. The highselectivity index of the purified flavonoids indicates valuable components withpotential few side effects for normal cell lines. However, solubility tests forisolated components indicates the need for novel pharmaceutical dosage forms, in the case for using natural flavonoids as chemotherapeutic agents.DOI: 10.1080/14786419.2018.1428590 PMID: 29457735
