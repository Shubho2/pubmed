The objective of this retrospective chartreview study was to compare the prognostic outcomes between two types of patientswith hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We estimated overall survival of the two groups andevaluated the progressive course of the disease using disease-free interval (DFI)and interval from the end of adjuvant treatment to the first recurrence (AFI).RESULTS: We studied 172 patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer, of which 65 werede novo and 107 were recurrent. Median OS between de novo and recurrent BC was4.85 and 3.45 years, respectively (p=0.046). Recurrent patients with a DFI<2years were found to have a significantly poorer prognosis than recurrent patientswith a DFI≥2 years (p=0.016) and de novo patients (p=0.002). Similarly, recurrentpatients with an AFI<1 year had a significantly poorer prognosis compared to denovo patients (p=0.026).CONCLUSION: De novo patients had better prognoses than recurrent patients withDFI<2 years or AFI<1 year, likely due to their therapy-naïve status or lowerresistance to systemic treatment.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11245 PMCID: PMC5905205PMID: 29475920
