Data were collectedfrom November 2016 to February 2017 and analyzed using correlation analysis andpathway analysis.RESULTS: Uncertainty, marital intimacy, and 4 sub-scales of QoL showed asignificant correlation. Marital intimacy was directly affected by uncertainty(β=-.39, p=.013) and 4 sub-scales of QoL were also affected by uncertainty. Amongthe 4 sub-scales of QoL, physical well-being (PWB) (β=.17, p=.026), socialwell-being (SWB) (β=.49, p=.010), and functional well-being (FWB) (β=.38, p=.009)were affected by marital intimacy but emotional well-being (EWB) was not affectedby it. The mediating effect of marital intimacy on the impact of uncertainty onQoL was confirmed. Marital intimacy showed a significant indirect effect on PWB(β=-.07, p=.024), SWB (β=-.19, p=.008), and FWB (β=-.15, p=.005), and it meansthat marital intimacy has a partial mediating effect on the impact of uncertaintyon PWB, SWB, and FWB.CONCLUSION: Effects of uncertainty on QoL was mediated by marital intimacy ofyoung breast cancer patients in their early diagnosis stage. It suggests thatmarital intimacy needs to be considered in providing nursing intervention foryoung breast cancer patients.© 2018 Korean Society of Nursing Science.DOI: 10.4040/jkan.2018.48.1.50 PMID: 29535284  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
