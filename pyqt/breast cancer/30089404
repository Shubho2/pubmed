DNA hypermethylation in the promoter of MFAP4 decreased its mRNA expression. MFAP4 strongly associated with pathway inimpairment and alteration of the elastic fibers.CONCLUSION: This integrated analysis provides new insights into MFAPs in humancancers and indicates that MFAP4 could be used as novel biomarker for developing therapies against human cancers.DOI: 10.2217/epi-2018-0080 PMID: 30089404
