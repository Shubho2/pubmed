(Arg72Pro) polymorphism(rs1042522) with the risk of breast cancer (BC) development in the Moroccanpopulation.METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population consisted of 125 female patients withconfirmed BC and 126 healthy controls. DNA samples were genotyped by PolymeraseChain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism assay method using BstUI restriction enzyme. We showed that the homozygous genotype of TP53 72Pro variant was significantly associated with increased BC risk (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.07-4.54, p = 0.03). The dominant and additive models of TP53 Pro allele were also correlatedto the risk of BC (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.07-4.23, p = 0.02 and OR 1.49, 95% CI1.03-2.16, p = 0.03, respectively). Furthermore, the TP53 Arg72 variant wasassociated with protection against BC, either in the homozygous genotype, thedominant or the additive models (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22-0.93, p = 0.03; OR 0.46,95% CI 0.23-0.92, p = 0.029 and OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.97, p = 0.03,respectively).CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that TP53 c.215G>C, p. (Arg72Pro) polymorphismmay be considered as a genetic marker for predisposition to BC in Moroccanpopulation.© 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.DOI: 10.1159/000489852 PMID: 29949804
