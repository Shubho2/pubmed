Italy.Along with playing an important role in circadian rhythm, melatonin is thought toplay a significant role in preventing cells from damage, as well as in theinhibition of growth and in triggering of apoptosis in malignant cells. Itsrelationship with circadian rhythms, energetic homeostasis, diet, and metabolism,is fundamental to achieve a better comprehension of how melatonin has beenconsidered a chemopreventive molecule, though very few papers dealt with thisissue. In this article, we tried to review the most recent evidence regarding theprotective as well as the antitumoral mechanisms of melatonin, as related to dietand metabolic balance. From different studies, it was evident that anintracellular antioxidant defense mechanism is activated by upregulating anantioxidant gene battery in the presence of high-dose melatonin in malignantcells. Like other broad-spectrum antioxidant molecules, melatonin plays a vitalrole in killing tumor cells, preventing metastasis, and simultaneously keepingnormal cells protected from oxidative stress and other types of tissue damage.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/0929867325666180501094850 PMID: 29714136
