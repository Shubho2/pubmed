The most notable and widely used hasbeen the three-dimensional derivative of digital mammography, known as digitalbreast tomosynthesis (DBT). In this article, we review the screening anddiagnostic applications of DBT, along with its limitations. We also brieflyaddress several supplemental breast imaging modalities.RECENT FINDINGS: The accumulating evidence from both small and large-scale trialshas shown a significant reduction in recall rates and slight increase in cancerdetection rates when using DBT. However, the incremental increase in cancersdetected remains less than that achieved with several supplemental imagingmodalities, including whole-breast ultrasound, MRI, and MBI (molecular breastimaging). Other modalities, such as CEM (contrast-enhanced mammography) and CET(contrast-enhanced tomography), are also being investigated. Numerous studieshave confirmed the added value of DBT and its increased cancer detection rate in both the screening and diagnostic settings. However, the superior sensitivity of supplemental imaging modalities renders them essential, especially in high-riskpatients, and potentially those with dense breasts.DOI: 10.1007/s11912-018-0700-3 PMID: 29845403
