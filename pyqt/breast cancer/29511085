SALL4 expression therefore has the potential topromote cancer malignancy. However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in SALL4protein expression have not been thoroughly elucidated. In this study, weobserved that treating MCF-7 and SUM159 breast cancer cell lines with aproteasome inhibitor increases SALL4 protein levels, suggesting that SALL4 isdegraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Using immunoprecipitation to uncoverSALL4-binding proteins, we identified an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21). Using an EGFP reporter probe of the major SALL4isoform SALL4B, we observed that shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRIM21 increasescellular SALL4B levels. Immunostaining experiments revealed that TRIM21 localizesto the nucleus, and a K64R substitution in the nuclear localization motif inSALL4B increased SALL4B levels in the cytoplasm. These results suggested thatTRIM21 is involved in nuclear SALL4 degradation. To identify the amino acidresidue that is targeted by TRIM21, we fragmented the SALL4B sequence, fused itto EGFP, and identified Lys-190 in SALL4B as TRIM21's target residue. Amino acid sequence alignments of SALL family members indicated that the region around SALL4Lys-190 is conserved in both SALL1 and SALL3. Because SALL1 and SALL4 havesimilar functions, we constructed a SALL1-EGFP probe and found that the TRIM21knockdown increases SALL1 levels, indicating that TRIM21 degrades both SALL1 and SALL4. Our findings extend our understanding of SALL4 and SALL1 regulation andmay contribute to the development of SALL4-targeting therapies.Â© 2018 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.000245 PMCID: PMC5925811 [Available on 2019-04-27]PMID: 29511085
