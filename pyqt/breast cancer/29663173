In addition tomarked improvements in rates of breast conservation, the identification ofextreme responders on the basis of the preoperative endocrine prognostic index(PEPI) provides a rationale to avoid chemotherapy on the basis of highlyfavorable prognosis in some patients. Finally, samples accrued from patientstreated with neoadjuvant therapy are providing valuable insights into themolecular basis for intrinsic resistance to endocrine therapy and promise a more rational basis and precise approach to the systemic treatment of ER+ breastcancer.DOI: 10.1007/s11864-018-0538-9 PMID: 29663173
