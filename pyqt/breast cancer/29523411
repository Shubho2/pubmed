LSSM has been applied to redesign the 2D-2D breastrepositioning process (Lean) by the retrospective analysis of the database (SixSigma).MATERIALS & METHODS: Breast patients with daily 2D-2D matching before RT wereconsidered. The five DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) LSSM steps were applied. The process was retrospectively measured over 30 months(7/2014-12/2016) by querying the RT Record&Verify database. Two Lean instruments (Poka-Yoke and Visual Management) were considered for advancing the process. The new procedure was checked over 6 months (1-6/2017).RESULTS: 14,931 consecutive shifts from 1342 patients were analyzed. Only 0.8% ofpatients presented median shifts >1 cm. The major observed discrepancy was themonthly percentage of fractions with almost zero shifts (AZS = 13.2% ± 6.1%).Ishikawa fishbone diagram helped in defining the main discrepancy con-causes.Procedure harmonization involving a multidisciplinary team to increase confidencein matching procedure was defined. AZS was reduced to 4.8% ± 0.6%. Furthermore,distribution symmetry improvement (Skewness moved from 1.4 to 1.1) and outlierreduction, verified by Kurtosis diminution, demonstrated a better "normalization"of the procedure after the LSSM application.CONCLUSIONS: LSSM was implemented in a RT department, allowing to redesign thebreast repositioning matching procedure.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
