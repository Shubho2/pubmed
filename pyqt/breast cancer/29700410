To kill cancercells with ADCs, the target antigens are required not only to be highly and/orselectively expressed on cancer cells but also internalized by the cells. CD239, also known as the Lutheran blood group glycoprotein (Lu) or basal cell adhesionmolecule (B-CAM), is a specific receptor for laminin Î±5, a major component ofbasement membranes. Here, we show that CD239 is strongly expressed in a subset ofbreast cancer cells and internalized into the cells. We also produced a humansingle-chain variable fragment (scFv) specific to CD239 fused with human IgG1 Fc,called C7-Fc. The binding affinity of the C7-Fc antibody is similar to that ofmouse monoclonal antibodies. Although the C7-Fc antibody alone does not influencecellular functions, when conjugated with a fragment of diphtheria toxin lackingthe receptor-binding domain (fDT), it can selectively kill breast cancer cells.Interestingly, fDT-bound C7-Fc shows anticancer activity in CD239-highly positiveSKBR3 cells, but not in weakly positive cells. Our results show that CD239 is apromising antigen for ADC-based breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-24961-4 PMCID: PMC5919910PMID: 29700410
