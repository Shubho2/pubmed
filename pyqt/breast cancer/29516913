The extract was concentrated to yield thecrude extract, which was tested for anticancer potentials. The anticancerpotential of cytotoxic extracts was determined by3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and DNAfragmentation assays in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7).Results: All the tested extracts showed significant antiproliferative activities in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The inhibitory concentration ofextract was tested against target cell line, and the results show in vitro leafof A. javanica has higher inhibitory effect against the tested cancer cells atlower concentration (about 11.89 and 22.45 Î¼g/ml) followed by other samplesextracts.Conclusion: The results of the present study conclude in vitro plant samplehaving more potent anticancer property and support the need of further studies toisolate potential anticancer drug with cancer cell-specific cytotoxicity.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.171210 PMID: 29516913
