China.Telocinobufagin (TBG), an active ingredient of Venenumbufonis, exhibits animmunomodulatory activity. However, its antimetastatic activity in breast cancer remains unknown. The present study investigated whether TBG prevents breastcancer metastasis and evaluated its regulatory mechanism. TBG inhibited themigration and invasion of 4T1 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, TBG triggered thecollapse of F-actin filaments in breast cancer. The epithelial-mesenchymaltransition (EMT) markers, vimentin and fibronectin, were downregulated following TBG treatment. However, E-cadherin was upregulated following TBG treatment.Snail, a crucial transcriptional factor of EMT, was downregulated following TBGtreatment. Signaling pathway markers, including phosphorylated protein kinase B(P-Akt), p-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p-extracellularsignal-regulated kinase (ERK), were decreased following TBG treatment. The sameresults were obtained from in vivo experiments. In conclusion, in vitro and invivo experiments reveal that TBG inhibited migration, invasion and EMT via thephosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/ERK/Snail signaling pathway in breastcancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8349 PMCID: PMC5920466PMID: 29725474
