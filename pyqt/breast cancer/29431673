In this issue, Jenkins and colleagues and Deng and colleagues report the use of organotypic cultures of tumors derived from miceand humans containing both tumor cells and cells from their local immunemicroenvironment to recapitulate the in vivo use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and extend the application of this system to therapeutic combinations of immunecheckpoint blockade and molecularly targeted agents.
