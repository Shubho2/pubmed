The questionnaire comprised a case presentation and two associatedquestions. The case outlined a woman diagnosed with right breast cancer; coreneedle biopsy had confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma and tumor size was 4 cm on imaging examination. Fine needle aspiration examination for axillary lymph nodeenlargement showed metastatic carcinoma. The patient underwent neoadjuvantchemotherapy and tumor size was decreased by 2 cm; axillary lymph nodeenlargement was not observed on palpitation or imaging examination. Finally, the patient underwent breast conserving surgery. Survey recipients were asked: 1.Would you perform SNB in this patient? 2. If you perform SNB and no axillary nodemetastasis is seen, would you perform additional axillary lymph node dissection(ALND)?RESULTS: The response rate was 28.2% (71/252) and 15.1% (38/252) in 2013 and2017, respectively. For the first question, the SNB to ALND ratio increasedsignificantly from 54% versus 46% in 2013 to 92% versus 8% in 2017 (p < 0.001).The proportion of surgeons performing no additional ALND versus additional ALNDincreased from 38% versus 54% in 2013 to 53% versus 37% in 2017, but did notreach statistical significance (p = 0.1).CONCLUSIONS: These data show that application of SNB among clinicallynode-negative patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer with nodemetastasis has increased among surgeons in Korea.Copyright © 2018.
