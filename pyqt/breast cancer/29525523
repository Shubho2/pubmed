Young women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are atparticular risk of adverse mental health outcomes.OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the prevalence of and factors associated withanxiety and depression symptoms in young women with newly diagnosed de novo MBC.METHODS: A total of 54 women with newly diagnosed de novo MBC were identifiedfrom an ongoing, prospective, multicenter cohort of women diagnosed with breastcancer at age <40. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using theHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Items assessing socio-demographics,physical symptom burden, social support, and disease and treatment history, with complementary medical record review, were used to assess variables potentiallyassociated with anxiety and depression symptoms.RESULTS: Mean HADS Depression score was 4.4 (standard deviation = 3.7) and meanHADS Anxiety score was 7.9 (standard deviation = 5.0). Eleven (20%) women scored ≥8 on the HADS Depression subscale, the suggested threshold fordepression/anxiety screening, and 24 (44%) women scored ≥8 on the HADS Anxietysubscale. In a multivariable model of anxiety, higher physical symptom scores(odds ratio = 4.41, p = 0.005) was significantly associated with higher anxietyscores. None of the other variables improved the model fit.CONCLUSION: In this study, a considerable proportion of young women with newlydiagnosed MBC experienced anxiety symptoms, although depression was less common. Future strategies focused on distress reduction in young MBC patients shouldfocus on physical symptom management as well as anxiety identification andmanagement.Copyright © 2018 Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry.
