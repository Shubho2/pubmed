Electronicaddress: aiguo@nimte.ac.cn.Nanoparticle-based tumor therapies are extensively studied; however, few arecapable of improving patient survival time due to premature drug leakage, offtarget effects, and poor tissue penetration. Previously, we successfullysynthesized a novel family of Y1 receptor (Y1R) ligand modified, photoluminescentBPLP nanobubbles and nanoparticles for targeted breast cancer ultrasound imaging;however, increased accumulation could also be observed in the liver, kidney, and spleen, suggesting significant interaction of the particles with macrophagesin vivo. Herein, for the first time, we imparted antiphagocytosis capability toY1R ligand functionalized BPLP-WPU polymeric micelles through the incorporationof a CD47 human glycoprotein based self-peptide. Application of self-peptidemodified, DOX loaded micelles in vivo resulted in a 100% survival rate andcomplete tumor necrosis over 100 days of treatment. In vivo imaging of SPIONloaded, self-peptide modified micelles revealed effective targeting to the tumor site while analysis of iron content demonstrated reduced particle accumulation inthe liver and kidney, demonstrating reduced macrophage interaction, as well as a 2-fold increase of particles in the tumor. As these results demonstrate, Y1Rligand, self-peptide modified BPLP-WPU micelles are capable of target specificcancer treatment and imaging, making them ideal candidates to improve survivalrate and tumor reduction clinically.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
