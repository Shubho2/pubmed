A meta-analysis of annual cancer incidence rates was performed.The outcome was the cumulative incidence of GI-other-than-GCs and non-GICs (ratiobetween the numbers of new cancer cases identified during the follow-up periodand the number of PA patients) and the incidence rate expressed as the rate ofevents-per-time-unit (person-years).RESULTS: Of 82,257 PA patients, the pooled incidence rates/100 person-years fornon-GCs and non-GICs of 0.27 (95% CI:0.16-0.42) and 0.23 (95% CI:0.22-0.25) were calculated by meta-analysis. Compared to the GLOBOCAN data for the generalpopulation from the countries of the included studies, the meta-analysis showedan overall relative risk (RR) of cancer in PA of 0.68 (95% CI:0.48-0.95). PApatients had a lower RR of colorectal, breast, liver, oesophageal, lung, thyroid,ovary, non-melanoma skin and kidney cancers but had a higher RR of biliary tract cancer (1.81:1.21-2.70), multiple myeloma (2.83:1.76-4.55), Hodgkin's lymphoma(3.0:1.35-6.68), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2.08: 1.58-2.75), and leukaemia(1.56:1.16-2.12).CONCLUSION: An overall lower RR of cancers-other-than-gastric-cancer in PApatients but an increased RR of biliary tract cancers and haematologicalmalignancies was observed.Copyright Â© 2018 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.
