The free radical scavenging effects of methanolic extract of E. platylobawere tested using DPPH method. Crude methanolic extract exhibited potentialantioxidant activity with an IC50 value of 234.28 ± 21.63 μg/mL when compared to the standard BHT with an IC50 value of the 19.5 ± 0.8 μg/mL. In addition, thein-vitro cytotoxic activity of this extract was studied against MDA-MB-231 andMCF-10a cells by MTT assay for 12, 24 and 36 h. Our data showed 534.6 ± 7.2 μg/mLof extract following 24 h of incubation was the most cytotoxic dose againstMDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with other doses. This extract could induceapoptosis and promote cell-cycle arrest at S-phase in MDA-MB-231 cells after 24 hof incubation, as compared to the control group (p < 0.001) and couldsignificantly up-regulate the expression of bax and p27 genes at the level of 2.8and 2.2 folds, respectively. While, a significant amount of down-regulation wasobserved for bcl-2 gene expression, which was observed to be 0.4 fold. Thepresent results prove the anticancer capacity of crude methanolic extract of E.platyloba to inhibit limit cell proliferation, and inducing cell cycle arrest andapoptosis.PMCID: PMC5937100PMID: 29755561
