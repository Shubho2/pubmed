In the pro-metastatic cellline 1833, derived from MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, both hypoxia and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) influence the effect of miR-125b on ETSproto-oncogene 1 transcription factor (ETS1). The effect of hypoxia induciblefactor 1 alpha subunit (HIF1A), known to promote metastatic spread byupregulating prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), may be dampened bymiR-125b targeting PTGS2. Here, we investigated whether miR-125b plays a role in breast cancer metastasis by measuring its activity in response to thechemotherapeutic agent NS-398 in a xenograft model. NS-398 is typically used inthe clinic to target PTGS2. We also aimed to describe the molecular mechanisms invitro, since the enhancement of epithelial properties may favor the efficacy oftherapies. We report that in the xenograft model, miR-125b reduced metastasis to the bone. We also report suppression of PTGS2 enhanced survival by decreasingHIF1A in cells within the bone marrow. In 1833 cells transfected with a miR-125b mimic we observed several phenotypic changes including enhancement of theepithelial marker E-cadherin, a reduction of mesenchymal-associated genes and areduction of WNT-associated stem cell signaling. Our findings suggest that invivo, key players of the bone microenvironment promoting breast cancer spread areregulated by miR-125b. In future, biological molecules imitating miR-125b mayenhance the sensitivity of chemotherapeutic agents used to counteract bonemetastases.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0499-8 PMCID: PMC5920088PMID: 29700305
