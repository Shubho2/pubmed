Studies have shown that inhibition ofPARP and Tankyrase (TNKS) has significant antitumor effect in several types ofcancers including BRCA-negative breast cancers.METHODS: Identification of ZYTP1, a novel PARP inhibitor, through a battery of invitro assays and in vivo studies. PARP and TNKS inhibitory activity of ZYTP1 was assessed in cell-free kinase assay. In vitro cell killing potency of ZYTP1 wastested in a panel of cell lines including BRCA-negative cells. ZYTP1 was alsotested in xenograft models in combination with temozolomide (TMZ). Thepharmacokinetic profile of ZYTP1 was determined in rodent and non-rodentpreclinical species. Safety of ZYTP1 was assessed in Wistar rats and Beagle dogs upon repeated dosing.RESULTS: ZYTP1 inhibited PARP1, PARP2, Tankyrase-1 and Tankyrase-2 with IC50 of5.4, 0.7, 133.3 and 289.8 nM, respectively, and additionally trapped PARP1 ontodamaged DNA. It also potentiated MMS-mediated killing of different cancer celllines. Compound demonstrated good Caco-2 cell permeability. The oralbioavailability of ZYTP1 in mice, rats and dogs ranged between 40 and 79% anddemonstrated efficacy in colon cancer xenograft model at a dose of 1-10 mg/kg in combination with TMZ. In a 28-day repeat dosing, oral toxicity study in rats, it was found to show > 10× safety margin.CONCLUSIONS: ZYTP1 is a novel PARP inhibitor that showed potential fordevelopment as a treatment for various solid tumors.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3653-1 PMID: 30046848
