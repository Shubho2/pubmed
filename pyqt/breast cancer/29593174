These compoundswere identified by NMR, high-resolution electrospray ionisation (HR-ESI)-MS aswell as IR spectroscopy. Compounds 1 and 2 were assigned NMR spectrums with1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, distortionless enhancement by polarization (DEPT), correlationspectroscopy (COSY), heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC),heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity (HMBC) and nuclear Overhauser effectspectroscopy (NOESY). Stereo configuration of 1 and 2 were confirmed bycomprehensive interpretation of their nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE)relationship and showed they were first natural lathyrane-type diterpenespossessing α-configuration substitutes at C-3. Cytotoxicity assay of isolatedcompounds were evaluated against breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231,786-0 and liver cancer cell lines HepG2. As a result, Euphorbia factor L28 (2)showed strongly cytotoxicity to the 786-0 and HepG2 cell lines, with an IC50value of 9.43 and 13.22 µM, respectively, which preliminarily suggested that the configuration of lathyrane-type diterpene at C-3 has a significant effect on its bioactivity.DOI: 10.1248/cpb.c17-00946 PMID: 29593174  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
