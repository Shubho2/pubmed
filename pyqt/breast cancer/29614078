We used the dynamics oftranscriptional changes resolved by PRO-seq to identify a regulatory networkresponsible for endocrine resistance in breast cancer. We show that GDNF leads toendocrine resistance by switching the active state in a bi-stable feedback loopbetween GDNF, EGR1, and the master transcription factor ERα. GDNF stimulates MAP kinase, activating the transcription factors SRF and AP-1. SRF initiates animmediate transcriptional response, activating EGR1 and suppressing ERα. Newlytranslated EGR1 protein activates endogenous GDNF, leading to constitutive GDNFand EGR1 up-regulation, and the sustained down-regulation of ERα. Endocrineresistant MCF-7 cells are constitutively in the GDNF-high/ ERα-low state,suggesting that the state in the bi-stable feedback loop may provide a 'memory'of endocrine resistance. Thus, we identified a regulatory network switch thatcontributes to drug resistance in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194522 PMCID: PMC5882141PMID: 29614078  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
