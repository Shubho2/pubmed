We compared female Medicare beneficiaries who wereresidents of the US territories and had surgical treatment for breast cancer in2008-14 to those in the continental US in terms of receipt of recommended breast cancer care (diagnostic needle biopsy and adjuvant radiation therapy [RT]following breast-conserving surgery) and the timeliness (time from needle biopsy to surgery and from surgery to adjuvant RT) of that care. Residents of the USterritories were less likely to receive recommended care (24 percent lower oddsof receiving diagnostic needle biopsy and 34 percent lower odds of receivingadjuvant RT) and to receive timely care (45 percent lower odds of receivingsurgery and 82 percent lower odds of receiving adjuvant RT, both within threemonths). Further research is needed to identify barriers to the provision ofadequate and timely breast cancer care in this unique population.DOI: 10.1377/hlthaff.2017.1045 PMID: 29505365
