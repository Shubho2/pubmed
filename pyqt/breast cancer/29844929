They experience riskfactors owing to decreased mobility and are at risk for unique complications fromtheir oncologic treatment.Case presentation: A 54-year-old woman who suffered a T6 AIS A traumatic SCI in1981, who was diagnosed 32 years later with estrogen receptor and progesteronereceptor positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative invasive ductal carcinoma. During the course of her chemotherapy, she experienced several complications, including reflexive diaphoresis, urinary tract infection,leukopenia, anemia, dehydration, and weakness. These contributed to thedevelopment of a stage 4 ischial pressure sore, which required complex treatment.Discussion: There is a paucity of literature examining the complications ofchemotherapy that may be unique to those with SCI. Physiatrists will be seeingmore women undergoing oncologic care, as this population of patients ages. Amultidisciplinary approach that takes into account the pathophysiologic changesassociated with SCI is crucial to understand and prevent complications that couldaffect their outcomes and contribute to increased cost in a value-basedhealth-care system.DOI: 10.1038/s41394-018-0079-2 PMCID: PMC5966429 [Available on 2019-05-23]PMID: 29844929
