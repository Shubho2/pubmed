The aim was to identify the reoperation rate at our centre and identify influentialfactors, including a change in guidelines on margin recommendations and theintroduction of in-theatre specimen X-ray.METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records was undertaken to identify 562patients who underwent breast conservation at The Royal Melbourne Hospital andRoyal Women's Hospital between 2013 and 2015. All cases that underwent subsequentre-excision or total mastectomy were captured and factors influencing marginexcision recorded.RESULTS: Reoperation was undertaken in 19.5% of patients (110; 86 re-excisionsand 24 total mastectomies). There was a reduction in reoperation rate from 25% to17% (P = 0.01) with adoption of the margin guidelines in 2014, but no significantreduction with the introduction of in-theatre specimen X-ray in 2015 (21% versus 16%, P = 0.14). On multivariate analysis, factors that significantly influencedreoperation rates were the presence of multifocality on mammogram (odds ratio(OR): 5.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-16.7, P < 0.01); lesion size onmammogram (OR: 2.2 per 10 mm, 95% CI: 1.4-3.6, P < 0.01); smaller excisionspecimen weight (OR: 0.5 per 25 g of resection, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8, P < 0.01); andpure ductal carcinoma in situ on final pathology (OR: 5.9, 95% CI: 1.9-16.7, P< 0.01).CONCLUSION: Optimizing reoperation rates following breast-conserving surgeryremains a surgical challenge, particularly in patients with in situ or multifocaldisease. Adoption of international margin guidelines reduced reoperation rates atour centre; however, introduction of intraoperative specimen X-ray had noinfluence.© 2018 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.DOI: 10.1111/ans.14467 PMID: 29763991
