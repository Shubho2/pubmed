OPN mediates variousbiological events involving the immune system and the vascular system; theprotein plays a role in processes such as immune response, cell adhesion andmigration, and tumorigenesis. This review discusses the potential role of OPN in tumour cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis, as well as the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes in different cancers, including brain,lung, kidney, liver, bladder, breast, oesophageal, gastric, colon, pancreatic,prostate and ovarian cancers. The understanding of OPN's role in tumourdevelopment and progression could potentially influence cancer therapy andcontribute to the development of novel anti-tumour treatments.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0391-6 PMCID: PMC5834520PMID: 29500465
