Methods:In addition to replicating the original Cox proportional hazards models, nestedcase-control analysis was carried out for all subjects and for four differentbirth cohorts to examine the effects of excluding participants with pre-existing cancer history at enrollment. The potential for detection bias was investigatedusing the records of medical utilization and voluntary health checks ofcomparison groups. Results: The overall risk profile of the total sample wassimilar to that of the original study. However, in the stratified analysis offour birth cohorts, the cancer risk among people living near nuclear power plantsbecame higher in younger birth cohorts. This was especially true for thyroidcancers of females (hazard ratio (HR) 3.38) and males (HR 1.74), female breastcancers (HR 2.24), and radiation-related cancers (HR 1.59 for males, HR 1.77 for females), but not for radiation-insensitive cancers (HR 0.59 for males, HR 0.98for females). Based on medical records and health check reports, we found nodifferences between comparison groups that could have led to detection bias.Conclusions: The overall results suggest elevated risk of radiation-relatedcancers among residents living near nuclear power plants, controlling for theselective survival effect. This is further supported by the lack of evidence ofdetection bias and by records of environmental exposure from radiation wastedischarge.DOI: 10.3390/ijerph15030481 PMCID: PMC5877026PMID: 29522487
