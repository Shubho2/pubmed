Methionine-dependent cancer cells are unable to proliferate and arrest in the late S/G2 phase of the cell cycle whenmethionine is restricted in vitro or in vivo. Cell-cycle arrest in late S/G2 was used as a biomarker of methionine dependence for patient tumors inGelfoam® histoculture. Human cancer patient tumors, including tumors of thecolon, breast, ovary, prostate, and a melanoma, were observed to be methioninedependent in Gelfoam® histoculture based on cell cycle analysis. This simplemethod can be used to screen patient tumors for methionine dependence and thensubsequently apply appropriate chemotherapy for these patients to target thiscancer-specific metabolic abnormality.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7745-1_13 PMID: 29572800
