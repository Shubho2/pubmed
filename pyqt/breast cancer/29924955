This trial compared cisplatin with cisplatin plusdelayed administration of sodium thiosulfate, aiming to reduce the incidence and severity of cisplatin-related ototoxic effects without jeopardizing overall andevent-free survival.METHODS: We randomly assigned children older than 1 month and younger than 18years of age who had standard-risk hepatoblastoma (≤3 involved liver sectors, no metastatic disease, and an alpha-fetoprotein level of >100 ng per milliliter) to receive cisplatin alone (at a dose of 80 mg per square meter of body-surfacearea, administered over a period of 6 hours) or cisplatin plus sodium thiosulfate(at a dose of 20 g per square meter, administered intravenously over a 15-minute period, 6 hours after the discontinuation of cisplatin) for four preoperative andtwo postoperative courses. The primary end point was the absolute hearingthreshold, as measured by pure-tone audiometry, at a minimum age of 3.5 years.Hearing loss was assessed according to the Brock grade (on a scale from 0 to 4,with higher grades indicating greater hearing loss). The main secondary endpoints were overall survival and event-free survival at 3 years.RESULTS: A total of 109 children were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin plussodium thiosulfate (57 children) or cisplatin alone (52) and could be evaluated. Sodium thiosulfate was associated with few high-grade toxic effects. The absolutehearing threshold was assessed in 101 children. Hearing loss of grade 1 or higheroccurred in 18 of 55 children (33%) in the cisplatin-sodium thiosulfate group, ascompared with 29 of 46 (63%) in the cisplatin-alone group, indicating a 48% lowerincidence of hearing loss in the cisplatin-sodium thiosulfate group (relativerisk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 0.81; P=0.002). At a median of 52 months of follow-up, the 3-year rates of event-free survival were 82% (95% CI,69 to 90) in the cisplatin-sodium thiosulfate group and 79% (95% CI, 65 to 88) inthe cisplatin-alone group, and the 3-year rates of overall survival were 98% (95%CI, 88 to 100) and 92% (95% CI, 81 to 97), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The addition of sodium thiosulfate, administered 6 hours aftercisplatin chemotherapy, resulted in a lower incidence of cisplatin-inducedhearing loss among children with standard-risk hepatoblastoma, withoutjeopardizing overall or event-free survival.
