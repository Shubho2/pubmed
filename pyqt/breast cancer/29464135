Methods Charts of 150 patients, from 2009-2014,treated with only CKRS for brain metastases were reviewed retrospectively forpatient, tumor, and imaging characteristics. Parameters included demographics,Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scores, number and control of extracranial disease (ECD) sites, cause of death (COD), histology, tumorvolume (TV), and post-CKRS whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). The imagingcharacteristics assessed were time of complete response (CR), partial response(PR), stable imaging or local failure (LF), and distal brain failure (DBF). Theprimary tumor Ki-67s of the breast carcinoma brain metastasis patients, who hadthe longest median OS of any group, were recorded when available. Results Thepredominant age group for the 150-patient cohort was the younger 17-65 years ofage category, which was represented by 94 (62.7%). The 150-patient group hadslightly more males, 79 (52.7%). The majority of 111 (74%) patients had an ECOGscore of 1, 39 (26%) had 1 ECD site and uncontrolled ECD occurred in 112 (74.7%).The main COD was ECD in 106 (70.7%). The prevalent tumor histology was non-small cell lung carcinoma (88 of 150, 58.7%). The most common TV was 0-0.5 ccs (48 of150, 32%). The majority of 125 (83.3%) patients did not undergo post-CKRS WBRT.Imaging outcomes were local control (LC) (CR, PR, or stable imaging) in 119(79.3%), of whom 38 (25.3%) had CR, 56 (37.3%) PR and 25 (16.7%) stable imaging; LF was the outcome in 31 (20.7%) and DBF occured in 83 (55.3%). The median OS was13 months. Patients 17-65 years of age had a median OS of 13 months, while those 66-88 years, had 12 months. Females versus males had median OS of 15 versus 12months. The most prolonged median OS of 21.5 months occurred in those with anECOG score of 0. Patients with two ECD sites had a median OS of 14.5 months,while those with controlled ECD, 20.5 months. Patients with breast cancer brainmetastases had the longest median OS of 23 months. The median OS for each ofthree (0-0.5 ccs, 0.6-1.5 ccs, 1.6-4.0 ccs) of four CKRS TV quartiles was 13months and for those with 4.1-28.5 ccs, 10 months. Median OS for patients withversus without post-CKRS WBRT was 23 versus 12 months. The longest median OS of18.5 months for post-CKRS imaging outcomes was in patients with CR; those with LFhad a median OS of 11.5 months. Of nine patients with breast carcinoma brainmetastases with available Ki-67s from primary tumor resections, the Ki-67 values were ≥ 34% for four patients with CR, PR and stable imaging outcomes, and < 34%for five patients with LF. Conclusions An ECOG score of 0, ECD control, breastcarcinoma brain metastasis histology. undergoing WBRT post-CKRS and CR imagingoutcomes, each resulted in a longer median OS. The Ki-67 proliferation indicesfrom primary breast carcinoma resection correlated well with the brain imagingoutcomes in a small preliminary study in the present study's breast carcinomapatients with brain metastases.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.1926 PMCID: PMC5806933PMID: 29464135
