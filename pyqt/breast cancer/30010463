[Epub ahead ofprint]The transcription-independent mitochondrial cell death pathway is defective innon-transformed cells containing the Pro47Ser variant of p53.Budina-Kolomets A(1), Barnoud T(1), Murphy ME(1).Author information: (1)a Program in Molecular and Cellular Oncogenesis , The Wistar Institute ,Philadelphia , PA , USA.Approximately half of all human cancers contain mutations in the TP53 tumorsuppressor. In addition to mutations, there are single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) in TP53 that can dampen p53 function, and can increase cancer risk anddecrease the efficacy of cancer therapy. Approximately 6% of Africans and 1% ofAfrican-Americans express a p53 allele with a serine instead of proline atposition 47 (Pro47Ser, or S47). The S47 variant is associated with increasedbreast cancer risk in pre-menopausal African Americans, and in a mouse model for the S47 variant, mice are predisposed to spontaneous cancers. We recently showed that the S47 variant is impaired for p53-mediated apoptosis in response toradiation and some genotoxic agents, particularly cisplatin. Here we identify themechanism for impaired apoptosis of S47 in response to cisplatin. We show thatfollowing cisplatin treatment, the S47 variant shows normal stabilization andserine 15 phosphorylation, but reduced ability to bind to the peptidyl prolylisomerase PIN1, which controls the mitochondrial localization of p53. This isaccompanied by impaired mitochondrial localization of S47, along with decreasedinduction of cleaved caspase-3. Interestingly, we show that this defect occursonly for cisplatin and not for camptothecin. These findings show that normaltissues may respond differently to genotoxic stress depending upon this TP53genotype. These data suggest that toxicity to cisplatin may be decreased in S47individuals, and that this compound may be a superior treatment option for these individuals.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2018.1472194 PMID: 30010463
