Interobserver exercises demonstrated the difficulty of precise targetdelineation, especially in prone position; information on accuracy is evenscarcer. We tested the impact of inserting an additional indicator clip, marking the depth of the tumor in the breast, and the added value of a preoperative CT intreatment position on precision and accuracy.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 12 patients, tumor bed delineation was performed by fourradiation oncologists, with CTVstandard (clinical target volume) based onstandard delineation guidelines, CTVclip resulting from a 1-2-cm symmetricalexpansion with the indicator clip as center and CTVclip_CT expanding from themidpoint between the indicator clip and preoperative gross tumor volume (GTV) as center. Precision was measured as the mean pairwise Jaccard index (JIpairs)between observers, accuracy as the mean overlap between GTV and respective CTVs.RESULTS: JIpairs was 0.38 for CTVstandard, 0.75 for CTVclip and 0.59 forCTVclip_CT. Overlap rate of GTV with CTVs was respectively 0.48, 0.67 andimproved further to 0.88 for CTVclip_CT. High-dose coverage of GTV (D95 and D90) improved with an indicator clip, but the most optimal result was reached whenpreoperative CT was added.CONCLUSIONS: If EB-APBI in prone position is aimed for, an indicator clipintended to mark the depth of the tumor increases the probability of accuratetarget coverage, but cannot entirely replace the added value of a preoperative CTin treatment position. Avoiding the cost and effort of such CT implies a risk of missing the target, especially when small volumes are aimed for. Increasingtarget volumes to reduces this risk, questions the concept of APBI.DOI: 10.1080/0284186X.2018.1481294 PMID: 29873283
