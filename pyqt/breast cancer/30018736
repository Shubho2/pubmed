There is a growing interestin the S100 proteins and their relationships with different cancers because oftheir involvement in a variety of biological events closely related totumorigenesis and cancer progression. However, the collective role and thepossible coordination of this group of proteins, as well as the functionalimplications of their expression in breast cancer (BC) is still poorly known. We previously reported a large-scale proteomic investigation performed on BCpatients for the screening of multiple forms of S100 proteins. Present study was aimed to assess the functional correlation between protein and gene expressionpatterns and the prognostic values of the S100 family members in BC. By usingdata mining, we showed that S100 members were collectively deregulated in BC, andtheir elevated expression levels were correlated with shorter survival and moreaggressive phenotypes of BC (basal like, HER2 enriched, ER-negative and highgrading). Moreover a multi-omics functional network analysis highlighted theregulatory effects of S100 members on several cellular pathways associated withcancer and cancer progression, expecially immune response and inflammation.Interestingly, for the first time, a pathway analysis was successfully applied ondifferent omics data (transcriptomics and proteomics) revealing a goodconvergence between pathways affected by S100 in BC. Our data confirm S100members as a promising panel of biomarkers for BC prognosis.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25561 PMCID: PMC6044374PMID: 30018736
