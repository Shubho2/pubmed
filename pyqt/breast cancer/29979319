Despite anecdotal reports of long-term responders, mostcancers become resistant to these therapies.Different mechanisms of primary andacquired resistance to PARPi have been recently investigated including loss ofPARP1 expression, BRCA mutations with partial function, and acquisition ofreversion restoration of function mutations.SUMMARY: Here, we discuss the importance of PARPi in metastaticcastration-resistant prostate cancer and discuss the possible mechanisms ofresistance.DOI: 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000358 PMID: 29979319
