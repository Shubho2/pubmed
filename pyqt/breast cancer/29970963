Multivariatelogistic and Cox regression were used to identify risk factors and prognosticfactors for bone metastases, respectively.Results: In total, 12,794 patients (5.1%) were diagnosed with bone metastases at the initial diagnosis. Older age, unmarried status, lymph node metastasis, poortumor differentiation grade (Gleason grade), metastases at lung, brain, and liverwere all positively associated with risk for the morbidity and prognosis of bone metastasis in prostate cancer. Black race and higher T stage were positivelyassociated with bone metastasis development; however, they were not associatedwith a prognosis of bone metastasis.Conclusion: The incidence of bone metastasis in prostate cancer was approximately5% with poor survival. The prostate cancer has homogeneous and heterogeneous riskfactors for incidence and prognosis of bone metastasis, which may providepotential guidelines for the screening and preventive treatment for the bonemetastasis of prostate cancer.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S168579 PMCID: PMC6021002PMID: 29970963
