Inorder to overcome the disadvantages of antibody therapy (limited penetrationefficacy into tumor tissues) and photodynamic therapy (low targeting efficiency) on the treatment of HER2-positive human breast cancer simultaneously, an antibodyand photosensitizer combined Trastuzumab-chlorin e6 conjugate (TMPC) wassynthesized. TMPC exhibits high singlet oxygen generation under laserirradiation. In vitro data show that TMPC has specific HER2 selectiveinteractions, and ROS generation ability upon laser irradiation inducessignificant cell death in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. The enhanced tissue penetration ability and tissue access of TMPC resulting from local tissuedestruction by ROS generated from Ce6 is also demonstrated in breast cancertissue blocks. The enhanced ability of TMPC is supported by in vivo fluorescence images of SK-BR-3 (HER2-positive cancer cells) tumor-bearing mice. The in vivotest demonstrates approximately 6-fold enhanced accumulation of TMPC in xenografttumors with a longer retention time compared to that of the PEG-Ce6 conjugate at 24 h. Thus, trastuzumab and photosensitizer conjugation brings synergisticeffects for HER2 selective targeting, where TMPC enhanced tumor tissuepenetration improves tumor tissue access and responsiveness of trastuzumab inHER2 overexpressing breast cancer.DOI: 10.1039/c7bm01084b PMID: 29578555
