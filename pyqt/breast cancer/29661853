There are several barriers to overcome before preventionbecomes an established part of breast cancer management. The objective of thisreview is to identify the clinical challenges for improved breast cancerprevention and discuss current knowledge on breast cancer risk assessmentmethods, risk communication, ethics, and interventional efforts with the aim ofcovering the aspects relevant for a breast cancer prevention trial. Herein, thefollowing five areas are discussed: (i) Adequate tools for identification ofwomen at high risk of breast cancer suggestively entitled Prevent! Online. (ii)Consensus on the definition of high risk, which is regarded as mandatory for all risk communication and potential prophylactic interventions. (iii) Riskperception and communication regarding risk information. (iv) Potential ethicalconcerns relevant for future breast cancer prevention programs. (v) Risk-reducingprograms involving multileveled prevention depending on identified risk. Takentogether, devoted efforts from both policy makers and health care providers arewarranted to improve risk assessment and risk counseling in women at risk forbreast cancer to optimize the prevention of breast cancer.
