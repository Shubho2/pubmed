The symptomatic rates of five cancers(stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, and cervix) at each stage and the time ofearly diagnosis were investigated. The early detection rates of symptomatic andasymptomatic individuals were investigated.RESULTS: The percentages of symptomatic cases tended to increase with progressivestages. The odds ratio (OR) of stage IV compared with that of stage I was 12.23for stomach, 7.21 for colorectal, 16.91 for lung, 10.30 for breast, and 51.62 forcervical cancer. The proportions of early symptomatic cases at the time ofdiagnosis were low. Compared with the percentage of early symptomatic cases ofstomach cancer of 25.5%, the percentage of lung cancer was the lowest, at 8.2%(OR 0.26), and the percentage of breast cancer was the highest, at 30.2% (OR1.26). The percentages of early symptomatic cases of colorectal and cervicalcancer were 18.9% (OR 0.68) and 19.9% (OR 0.73), respectively. The earlydetection rates of the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups were 77.6 and 36.1%,respectively.CONCLUSION: Cancer registry data indicate that early cancers are asymptomatic,and once symptoms appear, treatment may not be effective. Policy makers shouldinform people of the necessity of cancer screening before they have symptoms.DOI: 10.1007/s10147-018-1287-2 PMID: 29785620
