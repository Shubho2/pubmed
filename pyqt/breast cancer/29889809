Although infected children are known to transmitCMV to their seronegative mothers, the frequency and magnitude of nonprimarymaternal CMV infection after exposure to viral shedding by children in theirhousehold have not been characterized.METHODS: A cohort of Ugandan newborns and their mothers were tested weekly forCMV by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of oral swabs. Infant primaryinfection and maternal nonprimary infection were defined by the onset ofpersistent high-level oral CMV shedding. Strain-specific antibody testing wasused to assess maternal reinfection. Cox regression models with time-dependentcovariates were used to evaluate risk factors for nonprimary maternal infection.RESULTS: Nonprimary CMV infection occurred in 15 of 30 mothers, all after primaryinfection of their infants by a median of 6 weeks (range: 1-10) in contrast tonone of the mothers of uninfected infants. The median duration of maternal oralshedding lasted 18 weeks (range: 4-42) reaching a median maximum viral load of4.69 log copies/mL (range: 3.22-5.64). Previous-week infant CMV oral quantitiesstrongly predicted maternal nonprimary infection (hazard ratio: 2.32 per log10DNA copies/swab increase; 95% confidence interval: 1.63-3.31). Maternalnonprimary infections were not associated with changes in strain-specificantibody responses.CONCLUSIONS: Nonprimary CMV infection was common in mothers after primaryinfection in their infants, consistent with infant-to-mother transmission.Because infants frequently acquire CMV from their mothers, for example, throughbreast milk, this suggests the possibility of "ping-pong" infections. Additional research is needed to characterize the antigenic and genotypic strainstransmitted among children and their mothers.DOI: 10.1097/INF.0000000000001877 PMCID: PMC6016842 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29889809
