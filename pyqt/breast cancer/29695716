Here we show that PRP4K, a kinase involved in mRNA splicing,phosphorylates Yki/Yap in the nucleus to prevent its nuclear accumulation andrestrict Hpo pathway target gene expression. PRP4K inactivation accelerateswhereas excessive PRP4K inhibits Yki-driven tissue overgrowth. PRP4Kphosphorylates a subset of Wts/Lats1/2 sites on Yki/Yap to inhibit the binding ofYki/Yap to the Scalloped (Sd)/TEAD transcription factor and exclude Yki/Yapnuclear localization depending on nuclear export. Furthermore, PRP4K inhibitsproliferation and invasiveness of cultured breast cancer cells and its highexpression correlates with good prognosis in breast cancer patients. Our studyunravels an unanticipated layer of Hpo pathway regulation and suggests thatPRP4K-mediated Yki/Yap phosphorylation in the nucleus provides a fail-safemechanism to restrict aberrant pathway activation.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04090-2 PMCID: PMC5916879PMID: 29695716
