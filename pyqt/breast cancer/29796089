Our aim was to evaluate the effect of the harmonic focusscalpel versus electrocautery in reducing seroma formation post-mastectomy andaxillary clearance.Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial study was conducted at theDepartment of Surgery of Suez Canal University Hospital from April 26th 2014 to30th June 2016. Seventy-two women, in whom a mastectomy and axillary clearancefor breast cancer were performed, were randomly allocated to either harmonicdissection (n = 36) or electrocautery (n = 36).Results: The mean operative time was significantly longer for harmonic dissectioncompared with electrocautery (2.63 ± 0.41 vs. 1.75 ± 0.26 h; p < 0.0001). Inaddition, a significantly smaller amount of intraoperative blood loss(69.4 ± 25.1 vs. 255.5 ± 41.6 ml; p = 0.002) and total drainage volume(1277.8 ± 172.5 ml vs. 3300 ± 167.5 ml; p = 0.002) were found in the harmonicgroup. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in the time of drain removal(10.9 ± 1.12 vs. 15.9 ± 1.44; p = 0.001) and the incidence of seroma formationafter drain removal [8.3% vs 33.3%; p = 0.003] in the harmonic group comparedwith those in the electrocautery group.Conclusion: Harmonic dissection technique leads to significant decreases inintraoperative blood loss, total drainage volume and postoperative seroma interms of shorter drain duration with a minimal increase in the operative time andbetter quality of life. Here, we recommend the use of the harmonic dissectiontechnique in mastectomy and axillary clearance.DOI: 10.1186/s13037-018-0155-3 PMCID: PMC5956966PMID: 29796089
