However, there islimited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk ofradiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancerincidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 yearsof follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poissonregression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age andreproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancersbetween 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposedbefore age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk(ERR) of 1.12 per Gy [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59] for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age (P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age70 ( P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect:for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche ( P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-at-exposure effects on ERRand EAR differed before and after menarche ( P = 0.043 and P = 0.015,respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposuresaround menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), thedata continue to suggest a dose response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiationexposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivityduring puberty.DOI: 10.1667/RR15015.1 PMID: 30044713
