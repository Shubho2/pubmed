At 5years of follow-up all eligible subjects were invited to write comments tofurther explore these findings.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using inductive qualitative methods informed by theexploratory analysis, comments were allocated to relevant themes. Keypatient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), clinical and demographic factors were collated for patients who did and did not comment at 5 years and comparisonsbetween the groups explored.RESULTS: Of 2208 women completing baseline PROMs, 482 proffered comments from 0to 24 months, forming nine distinct themes, including chronic conditions, lifeevents and psychosocial concerns. At 5 years, 1041/1727 (60.3%) women contributedcomments, of whom 500 randomly selected participants formed the sample foranalysis. Findings revealed comorbidity, impaired physical functioning andpsychosocial problems as key themes, with prevalent adverse effects from localand systemic treatments. Eight new themes emerged at 5 years, including ageing,concerns about future cancer and positive aspects of care. Women commenting were better educated, slightly older and more likely to have had chemotherapy comparedwith non-commenters. They had significantly worse PROM scores for global healthand key quality of life domains relevant to the difficulties they revealed.CONCLUSIONS: Difficult personal circumstances and other health concerns affected many women's PROM ratings at 5 years of follow-up, in addition to ongoing cancer treatment effects. Greater attention to multiple sources of distress andadversity could facilitate personalised care and aid interpretation of PROMs.Copyright Â© 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
