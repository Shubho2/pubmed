The host response to breast cancer is of increasing interest topathologists and may be a future focus for novel pharmacological treatments.METHODS: This study describes the pattern of distribution of stromalmyofibroblasts using immunostains for CD10 and smooth muscle actin (SMA) in 50primary breast cancers and their matched nodal metastases (68.6% nodes positiveand 31.4% nodes negative). The stroma within the tumor (intratumoral) and at the advancing tumor edge (peri-tumoral) was studied in both primary and nodal sites. A simple quantitative scoring system was employed for both immunostains. Thecorrelation between expression of these markers by stromal cells and standardpathological prognostic factors of stage, grade, hormone receptor and Her-2status was analysed.RESULTS: SMA-positive stromal cells were more abundant in peri-tumoral stromacompared with intratumoral stroma in both primary and metastatic lesions. SMAexpression in the lymph node metastases showed a significant correlation withtumor stage. SMA expression in peri-tumoral stroma correlated with Her-2 status.CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that myofibroblasts, particularlythose expressing SMA, might potentiate the progression of the carcinomatousprocess especially in nodal metastases. Thus these cells may be a potentialtherapeutic target.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
