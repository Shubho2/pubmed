The expression of PKM2 in ER BC MCF-7 cells, T47D cells and MCF-7/ADR cells (which are subject to adriamycin/ADR induction) weredetermined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. MCF-7/ADR (M/A) cells were grouped into blank group (M/A), negative group (M/A+NC), low expression ofPKM2 group (M/A+si-PKM2 group), overexpression of PKM2 group (M/A+PKM2 group) andglycolysis inhibition group (M/A+PKM2+2-DG group). Quantitative real-time PCR andwestern blot were applied to measure the expressions of PKM2, multidrugresistance, and glutathione-S-transferase π. Glucose and lactic acid kit was usedto detect the amount of glucose uptake and lactic production. Cell variability,clone formation ability, and cell apoptosis were respectively measured by MTT,clone formation assay, and flow cytometry. Transwell assay and scratch assay wereapplied for cell invasion and migration ability. By overexpressing PKM2 in MCF-7 and T47D cells and using 2-DG, the effect on sensitivity of adriamycin amycin wasexplored. MCF-7/ADR cells have both elevated mRNA and protein expressions of PKM2when compared with MCF-7 cells (both P<0.05). The cell activity of theM/A+si-PKM2+ADR group was notably lower than that in the M/A+ADR group andM/A+NC+ADR group (both P<0.05). In the M/A+si-PKM2 group, expressions of PKM2,multidrug resistance, and glutathione-S-transferase π, along with the amount ofglucose uptake and lactic production, as well as cell variability, cloneformation ability, and cell invasion and migration ability were inhibited,whereas cell apoptosis was increased in comparison with the M/A group and M/A+NC group (all P<0.05). On comparing with both the M/A group and the M/A+NC group,the M/A+si-PKM2 group displayed contrary tendency with the M/A+PKM2 group. TheM/A+PKM2+2-DG group had elevated PKM2 expression compared with the M/A group and the M/A+NC group (all P<0.05). In MCF-7 and T47D cells with overexpression ofPKM2, the sensitivity to adriamycin amycin, and cell apoptosis were suppressed,whereas the clone formation, invasion, and migration ability were enhanced. After2-DG, the sensitivity on MCF-7 and T47D cells was enhanced while clone formation,invasion, migration and cell apoptosis rate were decreased (all P<0.05).
