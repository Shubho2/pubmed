Studies validating RS arelimited to women. Our objective was to assess RS distribution and factorsassociated with high-risk RS in male BC.METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, weidentified men and women with ER+/HER2- BC from 2010 to 2013. Patients werecategorized into risk groups using the traditional and the Trial AssigningIndividualized Options for Treatment (TAILORx) cutoffs. Multivariable logisticregression determined factors associated with testing and high-risk TAILORx RS.RESULTS: We identified 1388 men and 154,196 women with ER+/HER2- BC. Twenty-five percent of men and 30% of women had RS testing. Mean age of tested men was 63;most were white (81%), had grade I or II tumors (67%), and had stage I or II(95%) BC. Factors associated with increased RS testing were younger age, recentyear of diagnosis, lymph node negativity, and lower-stage tumors (p ≤ 0.05). ByTAILORx, 21% of men had high-risk RS compared with 14% of tested women. Men with grade III and PR negative tumors were more likely to have a high-risk RS(p ≤ 0.05). Chemotherapy utilization was correlated with RS.CONCLUSIONS: Using a large population-based dataset, we found that compared with women, men were significantly more likely to have high-risk RS. Grade III andPR-negative BC were significantly associated with high-risk RS. Higher RS in men correlated with increased chemotherapy utilization.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6566-7 PMID: 29907942
