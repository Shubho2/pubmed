In this study we described clinical characteristics andprognosis of MBC and evaluated roles of different factors between MBC and female breast cancer (FBC).PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 42 MBC patients matched with 84consecutive FBC patients with similar year, age, tumor, node, metastases (TNM)stage, and estrogen receptor (ER) expression from 2003 to 2016. Their clinicalcharacteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed, andimmunohistochemistry for androgen receptor (AR), dachshund 1 (DACH1), sine oculis1 (SIX1), eyes absent 1, B-cell lymphoma-2, and p53 were performed on paraffinsections.RESULTS: MBC constituted 0.56% (42 of 7561) of consecutive breast cancer and had a median age of 55 years. The 14 paraffin samples from men and 28 from womenexpressed all the assessed proteins, and DACH1 was significantly higher in women (P = .043). Body mass index (P = .023) and DACH1 (P = .034) were correlated with MBC prognosis, whereas the expression of AR (P = .049), SIX1 (P = .048), surgery (P < .001), and chemotherapy (P = .001) were important for FBC in addition toalready known factors: tumor size and location, TNM stage (lymph nodes and organ metastasis), radiotherapy, and ER and human epidermalgrowth factor receptor-2(HER2) expression. No distinct difference in recurrence was observed between MBC and FBC (P = .667).CONCLUSION: In this study we found that DACH1 was expressed less in MBC and HER2 was expressed more in FBC. They were respectively correlated with MBC and FBCprognosis. Although no significant differences were observed between MBC and FBC prognosis, DACH1, SIX1, and AR expression requires greater attention to developtreatment strategies for MBC and FBC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
