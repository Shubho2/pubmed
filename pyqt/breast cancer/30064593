108. Am Surg. 2018 Jul 1;84(7):1223-1228.The Effect of Insurance and Race on Breast Cancer Tumor Biology and Short-TermOutcomes.Samiian L, Sharma P, Van Den Bruele AB, Smotherman C, Vincent M, Crandall M.To determine whether low-income status as demonstrated by insurance type has any association with aggressive tumor biology and breast cancer outcomes.Retrospective review of 535 women with new diagnosis of breast cancer fromJanuary 2009 to March 2013 was performed. There was no significant associationbetween race and stage at diagnosis. Women with Medicaid/Charity coverage werediagnosed at more advanced stages, more likely to have triple-negative breastcancer (TNBC), and had longer time to treatment. Rate of TNBC was higher in blackwomen and younger patients. There was no significant difference in breast cancer recurrence or survival by race, insurance type, age, or tumor biology. Inmultivariable analysis, only black race (P = 0.003) and Medicaid/CharityInsurance (P = 0.0008) were the most significant predictors of TNBC. Presentationof aggressive tumor biology and advanced stage is strongly associated withsocioeconomic factors as reflected by Medicaid funding and lack of insurance.PMID: 30064593
