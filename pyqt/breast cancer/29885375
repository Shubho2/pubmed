This study aims to assessthe impact of age on breast cancer mortality and other cause mortality 10 yearsafter diagnosis.METHODS: Postmenopausal patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancerwere included in the Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trialbetween 2001 and 2006. Age at diagnosis was categorised as <65 years (n = 3369), 65-74 years (n = 1896) and ≥75 years (n = 854). Breast cancer mortality wasassessed considering other cause mortality as competing event using competingrisk analysis.RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 9.8 years (interquartile range 8.0-10.3),cumulative incidence of breast cancer mortality increased with increasing age(age <65 years, 11.7% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 10.2-13.2]; 65-74 years,12.7% (11.2-14.2) and ≥75 years, 15.6% (13.1-18.0)). Univariate subdistributionhazard ratio (sHR) increased with increasing age (age: 65-74 years, sHR: 1.08,95% CI: 0.92-1.27 and ≥75 years sHR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.06-1.58, P = 0.013).Multivariable sHR adjusted for tumour and treatment characteristics increasedwith age but did not reach significance (age 65-74 years, sHR: 1.11, 95% CI:0.94-1.31; ≥75 years, sHR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.94-1.48, P = 0.055).CONCLUSION: Ten years after diagnosis, older age at diagnosis is associated with increasing breast cancer mortality in univariate analysis, but it did not reachsignificance in multivariable analysis. This is not outweighed by a substantiallyhigher other cause mortality with older age. This underlines the need to improve the balance between undertreatment and overtreatment in older patients withbreast cancer.
