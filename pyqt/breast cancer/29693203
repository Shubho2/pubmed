Interviews were transcribed and underwent thematic analysis using the framework method to identify salientthemes.RESULTS: Participants most commonly sought medical, lifestyle-related, andpractical information/support; however, when presented with an onlineintervention, participants most commonly gave positive feedback on content oncoping with emotional distress. Difficulty finding information and barriers tousing common sources of information/support including health professionals,family and friends, and peers were reported; however, some women also reportednot wanting information or support. All participants evaluating the existingintervention gave positive feedback on various components, with resultssuggesting an online intervention could be an effective means of providinginformation/support to women with ABC, given improved specificity/relevance toABC and increased tailoring to individual circumstances and preferences.CONCLUSIONS: Adaptation of an existing online intervention for early stage cancerappears to be a promising avenue to address the information and support needs of women with ABC.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4206-1 PMID: 29693203
