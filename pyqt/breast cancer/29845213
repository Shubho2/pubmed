The activity of PECAM‑1 appears to be mediated by modulationof the tumor microenvironment (TME) and promotion of tumor cell proliferation,rather than through the stimulation of tumor angiogenesis. The present studyaimed to extend those initial findings by indicating that the presence offunctional PECAM‑1 on the endothelium promotes a proliferative tumor cellphenotype in vivo, as well as in tumor cell (B16‑F10 melanoma and 4T1 breastcancer cell lines) co‑culture assays with mouse endothelial cells (ECs) or asurrogate EC line (REN‑MP). The pro‑proliferative effects were mediated bysoluble endothelial‑derived factors that were dependent on PECAM‑1 homophilicligand interactions, but which were independent of PECAM‑1‑dependent signaling.Further analysis of the conditioned media obtained from tumor/EC and tumor/REN‑MPco‑cultures identified TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor‑1 (TIMP‑1) as aPECAM‑1‑regulated factor, the targeting of which in the tumor cell/REN‑MP system inhibited tumor cell proliferation. In addition, TIMP‑1 expression was decreased in metastatic tumors from the lungs of PECAM‑1‑null mice, thus providing evidenceof the in vivo significance of co‑culture studies. Taken together, these studies indicated that endothelial PECAM‑1, through PECAM‑1‑dependent homophilic binding interactions, may induce release of TIMP‑1 from the endothelium into the TME,thus leading to increased tumor cell proliferation.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4422 PMCID: PMC6017270PMID: 29845213
