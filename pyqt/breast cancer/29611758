Older patients require an individualizedapproach that takes into account the patient's physical ability, socialcircumstances and mental capacity to tolerate treatment. This section featuresthree older women treated with eribulin for metastatic breast cancer. In thefirst case, a 70-year-old woman maintained stable disease into her 34th month of treatment with third-line eribulin. In the remaining cases, two heavilypretreated women (80 and 90 years, respectively) with metastatic disease andliver involvement presented objective radiological benefit to later-line eribulinalong with prolonged clinical improvement and good tolerability.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-0357 PMID: 29611758
