In 2011, social vulnerability had no impact on screeningparticipation, nor on compliance. In 2014, however, vulnerability was correlated with less frequent uptake of colorectal screening (despite an organisedprogramme) and prostate cancer screening (opportunistic), and also with reducedcompliance with recommended intervals (breast and cervical cancer screening). In 2016, the trends observed in 2014 were substantiated and even extended to breast,colorectal and cervical cancer screening uptakes. Social vulnerability has anincreasingly negative impact on cancer screening attendance. The phenomenon wasidentified in 2014 and had expanded by 2016.CONCLUSION: Although organised programmes have been shown to ensure equitableaccess to cancer screening, this remains a precarious achievement requiringregular monitoring. Further studies should focus on attitudes of vulnerablepopulations and on ways to improve cancer awareness campaigns.DOI: 10.1007/s11912-017-0649-7 PMID: 29508084
