Two recent studies performed in our laboratoryon Sprague-Dawley rats reported a statistically significant increase in malignanttumors of different sites (mammary gland, C-cells carcinoma, hemolymphoreticular neoplasia, and malignant heart Schwannoma) when ELFEMF exposure was associatedwith exposure to formaldehyde (50 mg/l) or acute low dose of γ-radiation (0.1 Gy)(Soffritti et al., 2016a) (Soffritti et al., 2016b). The same doses of knowncarcinogenic agents (50 mg/l formaldehyde, or acute 0.1 Gy γ-radiation), whenadministered alone, previously failed to induce any statistically significantincrease in the incidence of total and specific malignant tumors in rats of thesame colony.OBJECTIVES: A lifespan whole-body exposure study was conducted to evaluate thepossible carcinogenic effects of ELFEMF exposure administered alone toSprague-Dawley rats, as part of the integrated project of the Ramazzini Institute(RI) for studying the effects on health of ELFEMF alone or in combination withother known carcinogens.METHODS: Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed 19 h/day to continuous sinusoidal-50 Hz magnetic fields (S-50 Hz MF) at flux densities of 0 (controlgroup), 2, 20, 100 or 1000µT, and to intermittent (30 min on/30 min off) S-50 Hz MF at 1000 µT, from prenatal life until natural death.RESULTS: Survival and body weight trends in all groups of rats exposed to ELFEMF were comparable to those found in sex-matched controls. The incidence and number of malignant and benign tumors was similar in all groups. Magnetic field exposuredid not significantly increase the incidence of neoplasias in any organ,including those sites that have been identified as possible targets inepidemiological studies (leukemia, breast cancer, and brain cancer).CONCLUSIONS: Life-span exposures to continuous and intermittent sinusoidal-50 Hz ELFEMFs, when administered alone, did not represent a significant risk factor forneoplastic development in our experimental rat model. In light of our previousresults on the carcinogenic effects of ELFEMF in combination with formaldehydeand γ-radiation, further experiments are necessary to elucidate the possible roleof ELFEMF as cancer enhancer in presence of other chemical and physicalcarcinogens.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
