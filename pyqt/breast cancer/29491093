The aim of this study was to explore the correlationbetween protein expression in tumor cells and the risk of developing radiationdermatitis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Breast cancer patients receiving postoperative radiotherapywere included in this study. Tumor specimens from 122 patients were examined byimmunohistochemistry for the expression of Ki67, ataxia telangiectasia mutated(ATM) kinase, hypoxia-inducible factor-1-alpha (HIF-1a), inducible nitric oxidesynthase (iNOS), and a-glucosidase (aGluc). The findings were correlated with theoccurrence and severity of radiation dermatitis (Radiation therapy oncologygroup-RTOG grading scale), taking into consideration body weight and skin type(Fitzpatrick system). Data were explored further via pathway and networkanalyses.RESULTS: Correlation of radiation dermatitis (RTOG scale) with the observedincreased expression of Ki67, ATM, iNOS, HIF-1a and aGluc, failed to reachstatistical significance when skin type and/or body weight were considered.Network interactions of proteins involved in tumor growth (Ki67, ATM) and/oraffect the oxidation state of the cell (HIF-1a, iNOS, aGluc) were revealed, that may contribute to the risk of developing acute radiation dermatitis.CONCLUSION: Correlation of the increased expression of the studied proteins andthe occurrence and severity of radiation dermatitis in women undergoingpostoperative radiotherapy, failed to reach statistical significance. Pathway andnetwork analyses predicted that vasodilation and angiogenesis may contribute toradiation-induced dermatitis via mechanisms that need to be further explored. Ourstrategy serves as a paradigm for coupling histopathological data to molecularfindings and network analyses for risk assessment in the clinic.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12392 PMID: 29491093  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
