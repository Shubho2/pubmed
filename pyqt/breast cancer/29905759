[Epub ahead of print]Biomarker assessment of the CBCSG006 trial: A randomized phase III trial ofcisplatin plus gemcitabine compared with paclitaxel plus gemcitabine asfirst-line therapy for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.Zhang J(1), Lin Y(1), Sun XJ(2), Wang BY(1), Wang ZH(1), Luo JF(3), Wang LP(1),Zhang S(1), Cao J(1), Tao ZH(1), Wu J(4), Shao ZM(4), Yang WT(2), Hu XC(1).Author information: (1)Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center;Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai,China.(2)Department of Pathology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Departmentof Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.(3)Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Fudan University,Shanghai, China.(4)Department of Breast Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center;Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai,China.Background: CBCSG006 trial reported the superior efficacy of cisplatin plusgemcitabine (GP) regimen than paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (GT) regimen asfirst-line treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). Thisstudy focused on the updated survival data and the explorations of potentialbiomarkers for efficacy.Patients and methods: Germ-line mutations of homologous recombination (HR) panel,BRCA1/2 included, were evaluated in 55.9% (132/236) patients. PD-L1 expressionwas evaluated in in 48.3% (114/236) patients. A nonparametric sliding-windowsubpopulation treatment effect patter plot (STEPP) methodology was used toanalyze the absolute survival benefits. All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: Median progression-free survival was 7.73 (95% CI 6.46-9.00) months for GP arm and 6.07 (95% CI 5.32-6.83) months for GT arm (P = 0.005). No significant difference in overall survival was observed. There was significant interactionbetween HR status and treatment for PFS and status of HR deficient significantly correlated with higher ORR and longer PFS in GP than GT arm (71.9% vs. 38.7%, P =0.008; 10.37 vs. 4.30 months, P = 0.011). There was no significant interactionbetween gBRCA1/2 status and treatment for PFS. Patients with gBRCA1/2 mutationhad numerically higher ORR and prolonged PFS in GP than GT arm (83.3% vs. 37.5%, p = 0.086; 8.90 vs. 3.20 months, P = 0.459). There was no significant interactionbetween PD-L1 status and treatment for PFS, and no significant differences inORR, PFS or OS between two arms regardless of PD-L1 status. In STEPP analysis,patients with lower composite risks had more absolute benefits in PFS than those with higher composite risks.Conclusions: GP regimen has superior efficacy than GT regimen as first-linechemotherapy for mTNBC patients. Germ-line mutations of BRCA1/2 and HR panel are possible biomarkers for better performance of cisplatin-based regimens. Acomposite risk model was developed to guide patient selection for GP treatment inTNBC patients.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01287624.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy209 PMID: 29905759
