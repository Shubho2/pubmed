Existing strategies for optimizing the radiotherapeutic efficacy often focus on only one facet of the issue, which may fail to functionin the long term trials. Herein, we report a DNA-dual-targeting approach forenhanced cancer radiotherapy using a hierarchical multiplexing nanodroplet, whichcan simultaneously promote DNA lesion formation and prevent subsequent DNA damagerepair. Specifically, the ultrasmall gold nanoparticles encapsulated in theliquid nanodroplets can concentrate the radiation energy and induce dramatic DNA damage as evidenced by the enhanced formation of Î³-H2AX foci as well as in vivotumor growth inhibition. Additionally, the ultrasound-triggered burst release of oxygen may relieve tumor hypoxia and fix the DNA radical intermediates producedby ionizing radiation, prevent DNA repair, and eventually result in cancer death.Finally, the nanodroplet platform is compatible with fluorescence, ultrasound,and magnetic resonance imaging techniques, allowing for real-time in vivoimaging-guided precision radiotherapy in an EMT-6 tumor model with significantly enhanced treatment efficacy. Our DNA-dual-targeting design of simultaneouslyenhancing DNA damage and preventing DNA repair presents an innovative strategy toeffective cancer radiotherapy.DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.8b01508 PMID: 29812909
