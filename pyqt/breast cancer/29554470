This population-based model simulates the lifetimes of individualwomen through 4 main model components: breast cancer natural history, detection, treatment, and mortality. A key feature of the UWBCS is that, in addition tospecifying a population distribution in tumor growth rates, the model allows for heterogeneity in tumor behavior, with some tumors having limited malignantpotential (i.e., would never become fatal in a woman's lifetime if leftuntreated) and some tumors being very aggressive based on metastatic spread earlyin their onset. The model is calibrated to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and EndResults (SEER) breast cancer incidence and mortality data from 1975 to 2010, and cross-validated against data from the Wisconsin cancer reporting system. TheUWBCS model generates detailed outputs including underlying disease states andobserved clinical outcomes by age and calendar year, as well as costs, resourceusage, and quality of life associated with screening and treatment. The UWBCS hasbeen recently updated to account for differences in breast cancer detection,treatment, and survival by molecular subtypes (defined by ER/HER2 status), toreflect the recent advances in screening and treatment, and to consider a rangeof breast cancer risk factors, including breast density, race, body-mass-index,and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Therefore, the model can evaluate novel screening strategies, such as risk-based screening, and can assess breastcancer outcomes by breast cancer molecular subtype. In this article, we describe the most up-to-date version of the UWBCS.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X17711927 PMCID: PMC5862066 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29554470
