The current study aims to evaluate the performance of different versionsof the Gail model by means of systematic review and meta-analysis with trialsequential analysis (TSA).METHODS: Three systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted. Pooledexpected-to-observed (E/O) ratio and pooled area under the curve (AUC) werecalculated using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. Pooledsensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio were evaluated by bivariatemixed-effects model. TSA was also conducted to determine whether the evidence wassufficient and conclusive.RESULTS: Gail model 1 accurately predicted breast cancer risk in American women(pooled E/O = 1.03; 95% CI 0.76-1.40). The pooled E/O ratios ofCaucasian-American Gail model 2 in American, European and Asian women were 0.98(95% CI 0.91-1.06), 1.07 (95% CI 0.66-1.74) and 2.29 (95% CI 1.95-2.68),respectively. Additionally, Asian-American Gail model 2 overestimated the riskfor Asian women about two times (pooled E/O = 1.82; 95% CI 1.31-2.51). TSA showedthat evidence in Asian women was sufficient; nonetheless, the results in Americanand European women need further verification. The pooled AUCs for Gail model 1 inAmerican and European women and Asian females were 0.55 (95% CI 0.53-0.56) and0.75 (95% CI 0.63-0.88), respectively, and the pooled AUCs of Caucasian-American Gail model 2 for American, Asian and European females were 0.61 (95% CI0.59-0.63), 0.55 (95% CI 0.52-0.58) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.55-0.62), respectively.The pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio of Gail model 1were 0.63 (95% CI 0.27-0.89), 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.94) and 17.38 (95% CI2.66-113.70), respectively, and the corresponding indexes of Gail model 2 were0.35 (95% CI 0.17-0.59), 0.86 (95% CI 0.76-0.92) and 3.38 (95% CI 1.40-8.17),respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The Gail model was more accurate in predicting the incidence ofbreast cancer in American and European females, while far less useful forindividual-level risk prediction. Moreover, the Gail model may overestimate therisk in Asian women and the results were further validated by TSA, which is anaddition to the three previous systematic review and meta-analyses.TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42016047215 .DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0947-5 PMCID: PMC5850919PMID: 29534738
