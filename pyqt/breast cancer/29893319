This study was conductedto investigate the serum level of survivin to determine its diagnostic value incancer patients.Materials and Methods: Blood samples were taken from cancer patients (n = 67)prior to surgery or chemo/radiotherapy and age-matched healthy volunteers (n =23). The serum levels of survivin were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbentassays. The difference in serum levels between patients and control was evaluatedby using statistical methods. Correlation between the serum levels of survivinand clinicopathological features of cancer patients were also evaluated.Results: The diagnoses of patients were breast cancer (49.3%), colon cancer(25.4%), ovarian cancer (14.9%), and other cancers (10.4%). Serum survivin levelswere significantly higher in cancer patients than healthy subjects (196.23 pg/ml vs. 117.73 pg/ml, respectively, P = 0.019). No significant relations were foundbetween serum survivin level and demographic characteristics of cancer. Theoptimal cut-off value of serum survivin was determined at >120.8 pg/ml, and itsserum levels above this cut-off value were associated with 4.198 times increased risk of cancer.Conclusion: Our study results may suggest that high serum survivin levels canshow 4 times increased risk of cancer in a subject with a high suspicion ofcancer. Furthermore, survivin level was not influenced with demographiccharacteristics of breast, gastric, colorectal, prostate, ovarian cancer, andglioblastome multiforme.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.171369 PMID: 29893319
