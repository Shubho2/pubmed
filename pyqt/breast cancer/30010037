The reduced expression of LATS2 has been reported in many tumors; including tumors of Breast, which is to the best of our knowledge has not beenstudied in north Indian female breast cancer population.OBJECTIVE: Here, we looked upon the expression pattern and methylation status of the LATS2 gene in north Indian female breast cancer cases to further strengthenits role as a tumor suppressor gene and more importantly as a cancer biomarker.METHODS: mRNA expression level was determined by real time PCR in 140 Breastcancer patients, Protein expression was studied by Immunohistochemistry andPromoter methylation was studied by Methylation specific PCR. All findings werecorrelated with clinicopathological features.RESULTS: LATS2 mRNA expression was remarkably downregulated in 67.85% (95/140)cases. The expression of Large Associated Tumor Suppressor 2 at protein level wasalso absent in 67.85% (95/140) cases. The absence of LATS2 protein stronglycorrelated with promoter hypermethylation where 91 out of a total of 107 hypermethylated cases showed absence of protein (91/107, 85%). The absence of LATS2protein was strongly significant with HER2 neu status (0.01), TNM staging (0.009)and Molecular subtype (0.024).CONCLUSION: The decreased expression in breast cancer seems to be associated withhypermethylation of LATS2 promoter regions. Further LATS2 as a tumor suppressorcan be recognized as a promising Biomarker in Breast cancer pathogenesis. Though,further studies, targeting larger sets of breast cancer population are requiredto establish LATS2 as a promising biomarker.Copyright Â© 2018.
