162. Comfrey.Drugs and Lactation Database (LactMed) [Internet]. Bethesda (MD): NationalLibrary of Medicine (US); 2006-.Comfrey (Symphytum officinalis) herb and leaf contains allantoin and rosmarinicacid; comfrey also contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Comfrey preparations havebeen used topically for pain following episiotomy and cracked, painful nipples,either as aqueous preparations or in creams and ointments.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]Scientific evidence of effectiveness for these indications is minimal. Thepyrrolizidine alkaloids in comfrey can cause severe liver damage, liver cancer,mutagenicity, and even death.[8][9] For this reason, the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration has banned the sale of oral comfrey products in the United States.Furthermore, most sources consider topical use of comfrey during breastfeeding tobe contraindicated.[1][10][11] If it is used on the skin, it should only beapplied to intact skin away from the breast on the smallest area of skinpossible, and for a limited duration. It is particularly important to ensure thatthe infant not come into direct contact with the areas of skin that have beentreated, because ingestion may cause severe liver damage. Dietary supplements do not require extensive pre-marketing approval from the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration. Manufacturers are responsible to ensure the safety, but do notneed to prove the safety and effectiveness of dietary supplements before they aremarketed. Dietary supplements may contain multiple ingredients, and differencesare often found between labeled and actual ingredients or their amounts. Amanufacturer may contract with an independent organization to verify the quality of a product or its ingredients, but that does not certify the safety oreffectiveness of a product. Because of the above issues, clinical testing resultson one product may not be applicable to other products.
