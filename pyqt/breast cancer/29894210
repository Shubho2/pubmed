A newly synthesized Antineoplaston A10 analog3-(4-methoxybenzoylamino)-2,6-piperidinedione (MPD) showed an antitumor activity in human breast cancer cell line. Unfortunately, MPD suffered from poor watersolubility.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pseudoternary phase diagram of oil (isopropyl myristate), surfactant (Tween 80), cosurfactant (ethanol), and water was plotted. MPDmicroemulsion (MPDME) was developed and characterized for particle size (PS),polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), and morphology (transmissionelectron microscopy). MPDME and MPD solution (MPDS) were radiolabeled withtechnetium 99m (99mTc) using stannous chloride dihydrate (SnCl2.2H2O). Molecular docking of MPD and 99mTc-MPD was performed to study the interaction with DNA.RESULTS: The impacts of intravenous (i.v.) and i.t. injections of 99mTc-MPDME and99mTc-MPDS on biodistribution were studied. The developed MPDME showed spherical droplets with mean PS (74.00 ± 5.69 nm), PDI (0.25 ± 0.03), and ZP(33.90 ± 0.90 mV). Labeling yield of 99mTc-MPDME and 99mTc-MPDS was97.00% ± 0.60% and 92.02% ± 0.45%, respectively. MPD and 99mTc-MPD showed almost same binding affinity with DNA binding site. Biodistribution results showed that i.t. injection of 99mTc-MPDME significantly enhanced tumor retention compared to i.v. route.CONCLUSIONS: Herein, the authors concluded that microemulsion could be used asi.t. injectable delivery vehicle to improve targeting and tumor retention of MPD.DOI: 10.1089/cbr.2017.2431 PMID: 29894210
