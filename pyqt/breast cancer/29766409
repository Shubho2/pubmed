We studied the clinical and pathologicalcharacteristics in YWBC and examined how outcomes and treatment have evolved.METHODS: YWBC were identified from pathology databases at two tertiary centers.Patients were divided into two cohorts: those diagnosed from 2000 to 2005 (C1)and from 2006 to 2015 (C2). Data were retrieved from clinical, radiology, andhistology databases. Statistical analysis was performed using R® (V3.2.0).RESULTS: We identified 345 patients. Median age was 36 years (23-39 years).Mastectomy was performed in 232 patients (67.2%) and axillary lymph nodeclearance (ALNC) in 207 patients (60% [C1 82.7 vs. C2: 49.4%, p < 0.001]). Onehundred-seventy patients (49%) were ER + HER2-, 88 (25.5%) were HER2+, and 58(16.8%) were triple negative. Eighty patients (23.2%) received neoadjuvanttherapy. Pathological complete response rates were statistically similar between C1 and C2 [C1 1 (0.9%) vs C2 16 (6.8%) p = 0.1]. Distant relapse occurred in 59(19%) patients. There was a higher relapse rate (RR) in C1 [27 (32.1%) vs. 32(15.7%), p < 0.002). HER2+ and ER+ HER2- patients in C1 had higher RRs than C2.Median overall survival in patients with metastatic disease was 29 months (range 2-119 months).CONCLUSION: Locally advanced disease was more prevalent in YWBC. Mastectomy andALNC rates were high and most received multimodal treatment. The extent ofaxillary surgery declined over time. Outcomes were unchanged in triple negativepatients. These remain a priority for research.DOI: 10.1007/s11845-018-1832-z PMID: 29766409
