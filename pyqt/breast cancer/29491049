The role of adjuvant endocrine therapy after surgical excision has been the subject of scientific debate in viewof the in situ nature of this neoplasm. We reviewed the literature and summarisedthe evidence regarding the need for adjuvant endocrine therapy following completesurgical excision of DCIS through the identification of the most importantoutcomes, evaluation of quality of evidence, and assessment of the trade-offsinvolved. There is no scientific evidence that adjuvant endocrine therapy reducesthe incidence of ipsilateral breast invasive recurrence or breast cancermortality in the context of adequate local treatment of DCIS in the form ofbreast conserving surgery with clear surgical margins plus adjuvant radiotherapy or total mastectomy. Therefore, its routine use is not indicated. However,adjuvant endocrine therapy can be considered after a rigorous multidisciplinarydiscussion and patient counselling in a carefully selected subgroup of patientswith high-risk estrogen receptor-positive DCIS.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12348 PMID: 29491049  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
