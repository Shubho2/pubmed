Recentstudies have suggested that FOXOs act as tumour suppressors in a variety of humancancers. This study investigated the clinicopathological significance of FOXOs intriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).METHODS: FOXO protein expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 125TNBC tissues. Correlations between FOXO protein expression and variousclinicopathological parameters, including patients' survival, were investigated. MDA-MB-468 cell line was used for in vitro cell proliferation and migrationassay.RESULTS: FOXO1 protein expression was not observed in all 125 TNBC tissues. FOXO4and FOXO6 protein expressions were detected in 11 (8.8%) and 14 (11.2%) TNBCtissues, respectively. Loss of FOXO4 expression was significantly associated withhigh histological grade (P=0.014, χ2 test), and TNBCs with positive FOXO6expression correlated with high grade (P=0.020, χ2 test). FOXO3a expression wasdetected in 40 (32%) TNBC cases and correlated with adverse clinicopathologicalfeatures, such as lymph node metastasis (P=0.021, χ2 test), perineural invasion(P=0.013, χ2 test) and higher Ki-67 proliferation index (P=0.048, t-test).Additionally, FOXO3a expression was significantly associated with poordisease-free survival (P=0.015, log-rank test). In the in vitro study,siRNA-mediated FOXO3a knockdown in the MDA-MB-468 cell line inhibited cellproliferation and migration.CONCLUSION: Among FOXO members, FOXO3a may have a potential role in promotingtumour cell migration and proliferation and may serve as a prognostic biomarkerand a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
