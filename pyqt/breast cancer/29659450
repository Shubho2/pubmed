D. Anderson Cancer Center.BACKGROUND: Although multiple acellular dermal matrix sources exist, it isunclear how its processing impacts complication rates. The authors comparedcomplications between two preparations of human cadaveric acellular dermal matrix(freeze dried and ready-to-use) in immediate tissue expander breastreconstruction to analyze the effect of processing on complications.METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed all alloplastic breastreconstructions with freeze-dried or ready-to-use human acellular dermal matricesbetween 2006 and 2016. The primary outcome measure was surgical-site occurrencedefined as seroma, skin dehiscence, surgical-site infection, or reconstructionfailure. The two groups were compared before and after propensity score matching.RESULTS: The authors included 988 reconstructions (freeze-dried, 53.8 percent;ready-to-use, 46.2 percent). Analysis of 384 propensity score-matched pairsdemonstrated a slightly higher rate of surgical-site occurrence (21.4 percentversus 16.7 percent; p = 0.10) and surgical-site infection (9.6 percent versus7.8 percent; p = 0.13) in the freeze-dried group than in the ready-to-use group, but the difference was not significant. However, failure was significantly higherfor the freeze-dried versus ready-to-use group (7.8 percent versus 4.4 percent; p= 0.050).CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study comparing the outcomes of alloplasticbreast reconstruction using human acellular dermal matrix materials prepared bydifferent methods. The authors demonstrated higher early complications withaseptic, freeze-dried matrix than with sterile ready-to-use matrix;reconstructive failure was the only outcome to achieve statistical significance. The authors conclude that acellular dermal matrix preparation has an independent impact on patient outcomes in their comparison of one company's product.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004323 PMID: 29659450
