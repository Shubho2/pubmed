The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the LN yield inelderly patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer.METHODS: The subjects were selected from a surgical database of 2065 patientsaged ≥80 years old who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer at 41 hospitals inJapan between 2003 and 2007. The patients were divided into groups according tothe number LN harvested: <12 and ≥12. Propensity scores were subsequently matchedto balance the baseline characteristics.RESULTS: Of the 954 patients initially selected, 331 were in the <12 LN and 623were in the ≥12 LN group. After cases were matched, 293 patients were allocatedto each group, and all covariates were balanced. For short-term outcomes, thetime for surgery was longer in the ≥12 LN group, but there was no significantdifference in morbidity between the groups. Overall, relapse-free andcancer-specific survival rates were higher in the ≥12 LN group (P = 0.004, 0.001,and 0.02).CONCLUSIONS: In patients aged ≥80 years old with stage II-III colon cancer,harvesting ≥12 LN provides a survival benefit, and therefore, limited LNdissection is not recommended in these patients.© 2018 Japan Society for Endoscopic Surgery, Asia Endosurgery Task Force and JohnWiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ases.12474 PMID: 29601663
