The aim of this study was to assess a relationship between cooking technique, especially fried to boiled meals ratio in the diet, and therisk of BC and BBD in a group of Polish women.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A case-control study involving 34 BC cases, 81 BBD casesand 122 healthy controls was conducted between July 2007 and November 2011. Allthe women were asked about their nutritional habits, especially the way ofpreparing meat and fish dishes. Then the ratio of fried to boiled meals wascalculated.RESULTS: High fried to boiled ratio was associated with increasing risk of BBD,but not BC. Women consuming fried dishes more often than boiled dishes hadelevated risk of BBD: OR = 3.04 and OR = 3.65 for the second and the thirdtertile, respectively. Adjustment for the other confounders only slightly alteredthis relationship.CONCLUSION: Women who preferred frying as a cooking technique had increased risk of benign breast disease, but not breast cancer. There is a need of more precise investigation to confirm this association.PMID: 30079899
