This study aimed to analyze the aesthetic outcome and changes in flap volume in patients with breast cancerundergoing radiation therapy of the surgical site after immediate autologoustissue reconstruction.METHODS: Immediate abdominal free flap breast reconstruction following unilateralmastectomy was performed in 42 patients; 21 patients received adjuvant radiation (study group) and 21 patients did not (control group). To compare flap volume,three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) was performed before and afterradiation. Also, aesthetic analysis was performed in both groups to evaluateshape changes.RESULTS: There was a 12.3% flap volume reduction after the completion ofradiation in the experimental group that was significantly greater than the 2.6% volume reduction observed in the non-radiation group (P<0.01). There was nosignificant difference in the short- and long-term aesthetic results between the groups.CONCLUSIONS: When performing immediate autologous breast reconstruction, 14%volume overcorrection is recommended for patients in whom adjuvant radiationtherapy is anticipated to improve aesthetic outcomes.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197615 PMCID: PMC5962051PMID: 29782518
