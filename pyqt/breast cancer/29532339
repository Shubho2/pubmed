This study aims tocharacterize the efficacy of cancer therapeutics in vitro and in vivo within the primary tumor and metastatic setting, using patient-derived xenograft (PDX)models.METHODS: We employed two basal-like, triple-negative PDX models, WHIM2 andWHIM30. PDX cells, obtained from mammary tumors grown in mice, were treated with twelve cancer therapeutics to evaluate their cytotoxicity in vitro. Four of theeffective drugs-carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dacarbazine-weretested in vivo for their efficacy in treating mammary tumors, and metastasesgenerated by intracardiac injection of tumor cells.RESULTS: RNA sequencing showed that global gene expression of PDX cells grown in the mammary gland was similar to those tested in culture. In vitro, carboplatinwas cytotoxic to WHIM30 but not WHIM2, whereas bortezomib, dacarbazine, andcyclophosphamide were cytotoxic to both lines. Yet, these drugs were ineffective in treating both primary and metastatic WHIM2 tumors in vivo. Carboplatin andcyclophosphamide were effective in treating WHIM30 mammary tumors and reducingmetastatic burden in the brain, liver, and lungs. WHIM2 and WHIM30 metastasesshowed distinct patterns of cytokeratin and vimentin expression, regardless oftreatment, suggesting that different tumor cell subpopulations may preferentiallyseed in different organs.CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the utility of PDX models for studying theefficacy of therapeutics in reducing metastatic burden in specific organs. Thedifferential treatment responses between two PDX models of the same intrinsicsubtype, in both the primary and metastatic setting, recapitulates the challengesfaced in treating cancer patients and highlights the need for combinationtherapies and predictive biomarkers.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4748-4 PMID: 29532339
