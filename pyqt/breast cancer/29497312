For HER2-positive patients, defined asimmunohistochemistry score 3+ or fluorescence in situ hybridization ratio â‰¥2.0,trastuzumab was recommended with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=45). Pathologicalcomplete response was defined as complete pathological remission of tumor cellsboth in breast and axillary lymph nodes postoperation.Results: In all patients enrolled in the study, a higher HER2 amplification levelwas significantly correlated with larger tumor size and the absence of ER and PR expression. In HER2-positive patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumabconcurrent with chemotherapy, both univariate and multivariate logisticregression showed that a higher HER2/CEP17 ratio and HER2 gene copy number wereassociated with a higher pathological complete response rate. When calculated by receiver operating characteristics analysis, an optimal cutoff of 4.5 for theHER2/CEP17 ratio was expected to distinguish the most sensitive candidate fortreatment with a combination of trastuzumab and neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Conclusion: A higher HER2 amplification level was correlated with larger tumorsize and reduced ER and PR expression, which may indicate more aggressive tumorbehavior. For HER2-positive patients, the HER2/CEP17 ratio and HER2 gene copynumber may be good predictive factors for concurrent neoadjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S157634 PMCID: PMC5818868PMID: 29497312
