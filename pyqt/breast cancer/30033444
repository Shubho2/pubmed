Although there are many reports on TIL density in primarytumours, little is known about its density in recurrent tumours.METHODS: Of 300 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy during the studyperiod, 29 were considered for evaluation of TIL density in primary and recurrenttumours. We performed a retrospective analysis of the association between TILdensity and prognosis.RESULTS: TIL density was significantly lower in recurrent tumours than in primarytumours (P = 0.007). There was no correlation between post-recurrence survivaland TIL density in core-needle biopsy specimens obtained from primary tumours(P = 0.837). However, patients with high TIL density in recurrent tumours hadsignificantly better post-recurrence survival than did the corresponding groupwith low TIL density (P = 0.041). Multivariate analysis revealed that high TILdensity contributed significantly towards improving post-recurrence survival inall patients (P = 0.035; hazard ratio, 0.167).CONCLUSIONS: In recurrent breast cancer, a decrease in TILs density was observed as compared to the primary tumour, and this affects the poor prognosis afterrelapse.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0197-4 PMID: 30033444
