MicroRNAs are known to play a crucialrole as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Specifically, miR-93 has been reported toplay a crucial role in colorectal, breast, pancreatic, lung cancer andhepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of miR-93 in LACC and the potentialmolecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. Therefore, we took the challenge todetermine the involvement of miR-93 in the LACC by targeting BRMS1L.Method: A total of 5 adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of lacrimal gland patienttissues and their plasma were examined. Three normal lacrimal glands and threenormal serums were collected as a control group. After surgical resection, thespecimens were preserved in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 °C until RNAextraction. Afterwards, LACC cells with miR-93-5p overexpression were subjectedto qRT-PCR and western blot for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markerslevels. Ability of LACC cell migration, invasion, proliferation and apoptosis wasexamined by wounded healing, transwell, CCK-8 and apoptosis assays. Afterwards,TargetScan was used to predict putative targets of miR-93-5p. Then, theexamination was performed whether miR-93-5p targets BRMS1L by the use ofluciferase reporter assays and western blotting. Finally, immunohistochemicalstaining was sone and all the images were taken using a microscope (Nikon,Tokyo).Results: Our results showed that miR-93 was overexpressed in tissues and plasmaof LACC patients compared to healthy controls. MiR-93 downregulated E-cadherinexpression while increasing N-cadherin expression and significantly inhibitedluciferase activity. Furthermore, western blotting results confirmed thatmiR-93-5p could inhibit BRMS1L expression. The BRMS1L staining in LACC tissueswas weaker than in normal controls. In addition, miR-93-5p revealed a reversecorrelation with the expression of BRMS1L. In addition, significant upregulation of E-cadherin and downregulation of N-cadherin were found when LACC cells weretransfected with BRMS1L. Finally, miR-93-5p significantly enhanced TOP/FOPluciferase activity. Upregulation of BRMS1L reduced TOP/FOP luciferase activitywhile further overexpression of miR-93-5p could not rescue Wnt signalingactivity.Conclusions: Our findings report that miR-93 promotes LACC cell migration,invasion, and proliferation via targeting downregulation of BRMS1L throughregulation of Wnt signaling pathway.DOI: 10.1186/s12935-018-0552-9 PMCID: PMC5944175PMID: 29760585
