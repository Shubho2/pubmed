Whereas localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)sensing integrated into a state-of-the-art microfluidic chip stands as apromising approach to meet this demand, its implementation into an operatingsensing platform capable of quantitatively detecting a set of molecularbiomarkers in an unknown biological sample is only in its infancy. Here, wepresent an on-chip LSPR sensor capable of performing automatic, quantitative, andmultiplexed screening of biomarkers. We demonstrate its versatility byprogramming it to detect and quantify in human serum four relevant human serumprotein markers associated with breast cancer.DOI: 10.1021/acssensors.8b00305 PMID: 29947221
