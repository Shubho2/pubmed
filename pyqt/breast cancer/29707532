We analyzed the possible association of CYP1A1 genepolymorphisms and tobacco smoking-related breast cancer in women from Iraq.Materials and methods: In this case-control study, gene polymorphism of CYP1A1gene (CYP1A1m1, T6235C and CYP1A1m2, A4889G) of 199 histologically verifiedbreast cancer patients' and 160 cancer-free control women's specimens wereperformed by using PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism.Results: Three genotype frequencies (TT, TC, and CC) of CYP1A1m1T/C appeared in16.1, 29.6, and 54.3% of women with breast cancer, respectively, compared with41.2, 40, and 18.8% in the control group, respectively. CYP1A1m1 CC genotype and C allele were significantly associated with increased risks for breast cancer in patients (54.3 and 69%, respectively) compared with controls (18.8 and 39%,respectively). While the three genotype frequencies (AA, AG, and GG) ofCYP1A1m2A/G were detected in 20.1, 31.2, and 48.7% in patients compared with46.3, 40.6, and 13.1% in controls, respectively. The frequency of GG genotypesand G allele was significantly higher in patients (48.7 and 64%, respectively)than in the controls (13.1 and 33%, respectively). Smoking women having either CCor GG genotypes showed a highly significant association with increased risk ofbreast cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 1.607, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-1.64,p = 0.0001, and OR, 1.841, 95% CI, 0.88-1.67, p = 0.0001, respectively]. On theother hand, the T and A alleles of predominantly seen in healthy smoking women(83 and 85%, p = 0.0001, respectively).Conclusion: These findings indicated that both C and G alleles of CYP1A1m1 and m2were significantly associated with elevated risk of breast cancer in Iraqi women,while the T and A alleles were predominantly seen in healthy controls which mayindicate their protective role. The C and G association with breast cancerincidence was more prevalent among tobacco smoking patients. These polymorphisms may be used as biomarkers of breast cancer in women from Iraq.DOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2018.00096 PMCID: PMC5906712PMID: 29707532
