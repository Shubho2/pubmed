Period 2 (PER2) is a repressive element, which inhibits transcriptionactivated by positive clock elements, resulting in diurnal cycling of genes.However, there are gaps in our understanding of the role of the clock in normaldevelopment outside of its time-keeping function. Here, we show that PER2 has anoncircadian function that is crucial to mammalian mammary gland development.Virgin Per2-deficient mice, Per2-/- , have underdeveloped glands, containingfewer bifurcations and terminal ducts than glands of wild-type mice. Using atransplantation model, we show that these changes are intrinsic to the gland and further identify changes in cell fate commitment. Per2-/- mouse mammary glandshave a dual luminal/basal phenotypic character in cells of the ductal epithelium.We identified colocalization of E-cadherin and keratin 14 in luminal cells.Similar results were demonstrated using MCF10A and shPER2 MCF10A human celllines. Collectively this study reveals a crucial noncircadian function of PER2 inmammalian mammary gland development, validates the Per2-/- model, and describes apotential role for PER2 in breast cancer.Â© 2018.
