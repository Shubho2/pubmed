Therewere 70 cases with bone metastasis (BM group) and 92 cases without bonemetastasis (non-bone metastasis, NBM group). The levels of the bone turnovermarkers PICP and β-CTx were measured using Electro-Chemiluminescence Immunoassay to compare the difference between BM and NBM group, before and after treatmentsin the NBM group, and to analyse the relationship with therapeutic effects.RESULTS: The BM group had higher PICP and β-CTx levels than the NBM group andalso higher in the non-luminal type group than the luminal type group, thedifferences were all statistically significant. However, no statisticallysignificant differences were found among the pN0, pN1, pN2, and pN3 subgroups of the NBM group. Among the 70 cases of BM patient after 3 months of treatment,there were 48 cases that showed clinical benefits, with significantly reducedPICP and β-CTx levels (p = 0.02, p = 0.00, respectively), but 22 cases showeddisease progression with elevated PICP and β-CTx levels (p = 0.01, p = 0.04,respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The bone turnover markers PICP and β-CTx have crucial value in thediagnosis and treatment efficacy evaluation for women of breast cancer with bone metastases.PMID: 29479886
