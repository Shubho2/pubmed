The authors describe a 52-year-oldman who presented with a 2-week history of diplopia and a well-circumscribedright orbital mass. The tumor was resected via lateral orbitotomy approach.Pathologic evaluation demonstrated secretory carcinoma, previously not described in the main lacrimal gland. Recognition of lacrimal gland secretory carcinoma maylead to reappraisal of morphologically similar, but biologically heterogeneouslacrimal gland neoplasms, providing an insight into this tumor's clinicalpresentation and prognosis. Accurate diagnosis of this malignancy has importantmanagement and prognostic implications, particularly with emergence of targetedtherapies.DOI: 10.1097/IOP.0000000000001173 PMID: 30059394
