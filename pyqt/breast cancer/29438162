The aim of this study was to assess the association of serum glucose and insulin with risk of these cancers inpostmenopausal women, while taking into account potential confounding andmodifying factors. We studied 21â€‰103 women with fasting baseline insulin andglucose measurements in a subsample of the Women's Health Initiative. Thesubsample was composed of four studies within Women's Health Initiative withdifferent selection and sampling strategies. Over a mean of 14.7 years offollow-up, 1185 breast cancer cases, 156 endometrial cancer cases, and 130ovarian cancer cases were diagnosed. We used Cox proportional hazards models toestimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) by quartileof glucose or insulin. Serum insulin was positively associated with breast cancerrisk (multivariable-adjusted HR for highest vs. lowest quartile 1.41, 95% CI:1.16-1.72, Ptrend<0.0003), and glucose and insulin were associated with roughly adoubling of endometrial cancer risk (for glucose: HR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.203.35,Ptrend=0.01; for insulin: HR: 2.39, 95% CI: 1.32-4.33, Ptrend=0.008). Theseassociations remained unchanged or were slightly attenuated after mutualadjustment, adjustment for serum lipids, and assessment of possible reversecausation. Glucose and insulin showed no association with ovarian cancer. Ourfindings provide support for a role of insulin-related pathways in the etiologyof cancers of the breast and endometrium. However, because of theunrepresentative nature of the sample, our results need confirmation in otherpopulations.DOI: 10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000435 PMID: 29438162
