However, itsroles in breast cancer stem-like cells (BrCSCs) are barely known. To dig out its mechanistic functions, we explored the indicative roles of miR-146 in preclinicalstudy, regardless of the hormone receptor status, and the positive correlationbetween miR-146 and better prognosis was proved, as its correlation to Let-7cwas. To uncover the implicated mechanisms, we first identified the suppressiverole of miR-146a in stem cells' renewal, which was achieved by promoting theasymmetric division of BrCSCs. Let-7c was previously revealed with itssuppressive functions in stem-like cells expansion, and miR-146 was predicatedand successfully proved to bind to and degrade the 3'UTR of LIN28, a maturationblocker of Let-7 family. Results further showed that miR-146a increased theLet-7c level through degrading LIN28, and LIN28 inhibition is required formiR-146a induction of asymmetric stem cells' division. Moreover, Let-7 controlledWnt signaling pathway activity could be strengthened due to the miR146 inhibitionof H19, later of which was often activated in stem cells group with functionalexistence of Wnt signaling. H19 itself in turn formed the positive feedbackregulation with Let-7. Our results suggested the miR-146a/LIN28/Wnt signalingcircle in restraining the symmetric cells division, which was specificallyreferred to the controlling of the small circle of Let-7c and H19, and together, this dual axis could help to prohibit the stem cells expansion.DOI: 10.1080/15384101.2018.1489176 PMID: 29954239
