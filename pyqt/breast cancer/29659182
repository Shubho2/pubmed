The rational application of CWI of ropivacaine requires a thorough understanding of its pharmacokinetics to investigate the risk ofpotential systemic toxicity. A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) study wasundertaken to describe the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine CWI during 75 hours.Women undergoing a unilateral mastectomy were scheduled to receive CWI for40 hours for postoperative analgesia. A 10-mL ropivacaine 0.75% bolus followed bycontinuous infusion (400 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine at a flow rate of 10 mL/h) wasadministered via a multihole catheter placed on the major pectoral muscle. PopPK analysis was performed using the nonlinear mixed-effects model. A 1-compartmentdisposition model with an absorption compartment and a transit compartment forthe infusion best describes the data (67 observations from 10 women). Population parameter estimates (between-subject variability, %) are apparent central volume (V/F) 269 L (39.1%), apparent clearance (CL/F) 18.8 h-1 (74.9%), and absorptionrate (K12) 0.406 h-1 . The model predicted Cmax as 1.45 ± 0.80 μg/mL, whichoccurred in the 42.4th hour (39-45.9 hours). This popPK model describes thepharmacokinetics of ropivacaine during continuous wound infusion and confirms thesafety profile of the present technique.© 2018, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.DOI: 10.1002/cpdd.452 PMID: 29659182
