Among these, Nigella sativa is a promising source of bioactivecompounds including thymoquinone, monoterpenes, p-cymene and α-piene etc.Thymoquinone has been found effective to inhibit the different cancer stages suchas proliferation, migration and invasion. It also acts as anticancer agentagainst different human cancers such as breast, pancreatic, prostate, blood,oral, bone, head and neck, cervical, liver and lung. It significantly mediatedmiR-34a up-regulation, enhanced the levels of miR-34a through p53, and downcontrolled Rac1 expression. Thymoquinone induces apoptosis, regulates the levels of pro- and anti- apoptotic genes. It also has been known to lower thephosphorylation of NF-κB and IKKα/β and reduces the metastasis as well as alsolowered the ERK1/2 and PI3K activities. Thymoquinone inhibits the metastasisthrough activation of JNK and p38. The present review article highlights theanticancer perspectives of thymoquinone in human by various pathways and use ofthis compound as diet based therapy has proven new pharmacological agent against several types of cancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
