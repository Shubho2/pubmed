[Epub ahead of print]miR-221/222 activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling to promote triple negativebreast cancer.Liu S(1), Wang Z(1), Liu Z(1)(2), Shi S(1), Zhang Z(1), Zhang J(1), LinH(1)(2)(3).Author information: (1)Shanghai Institute of Advanced Immunochemical Studies, ShanghaiTechUniversity, Shanghai, China.(2)School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai,China.(3)The Yale Stem Cell Center and Department of Cell Biology, Yale UniversitySchool of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by the lack of expression of the estrogen receptor, the progesterone receptor, and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, is an aggressive form of cancer that conveys unpredictable andpoor prognosis due to limited treatment options and lack of effective targetedtherapies. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is hyperactivated in TNBC, which promotes the progression of TNBC. However, the molecular mechanism of Wnt/β-catenin activationin TNBC remains unknown. Here, we report the drastic overexpression ofmiR-221/222 in all of four TNBC cell lines and TNBC primary tumor samples frompatients. Furthermore, we demonstrate by both ex vivo and xenograft experimentsthat inhibiting miR-221/222 expression in a TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231)suppresses its proliferation, viability, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition,and migration; whereas expressing miR-221/222 in a non-TNBC line (MCF7) promotes all of the above cancer properties. miR-221/222 achieve so by directly repressingmultiple negative regulators of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, includingWIF1, SFRP2, DKK2, and AXIN2, to activate the pathway. Notably, the level ofmiR-221/222 expression is inversely correlated whereas that of WIF1, DKK2, SFRP2,and AXIN2 expression is positively correlated with the patient survival. Last, weshow that anti-miR-221/222 significantly increases apoptotic cells withtamoxifen/Wnt3a treatment but not with cyclophosphamide/Wnt3a treatment. Theseresults demonstrate that miR-221/222 activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling topromote the aggressiveness and TNBC properties of breast cancers, and thus reveala new prospect for TNBC treatment.DOI: 10.1093/jmcb/mjy041 PMID: 30053090
