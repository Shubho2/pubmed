Patients whose lesions showed ≥20%enlargement on follow-up ultrasound were selected for this study. Radiologicaland clinical features including increase in the maximum diameter andanteroposterior dimension, morphological changes determined via ultrasound,palpability, multiplicity, new mass, baseline breast ultrasound indication andmammographic BI-RADS category were evaluated to determine their association with malignancy. Multivariate analyses were used to identify independent predictors ofmalignancy.  Results:  The frequency of growing BI-RADS category 3 lesions onfollow-up ultrasound was 5.9% (738 of 12,514). Of 527 lesions examined in 459patients with a follow-up duration of at least 24 months or with availablepathological results, 26 proved to be malignant (4.9%). Multivariate analysesfurther indicated that sonographic morphological changes (OR, 7.662, p < 0.001)and development of suspicious features on follow-up mammography (OR, 3.812,p = 0.009) were associated with malignancy. Enlargement without associatedsuspicious mammography or sonographic morphological abnormalities had only 1.9 % (BI-RADS category 3) chance of malignancy.  Conclusion:  The malignancy rate for growing BI-RADS category 3 lesions is 4.9%. Sonographic morphological changes andsuspicious mammographic features in these tumors are significantly associatedwith malignancy. Advances in knowledge: For lesions with an interval growth inthe anteroposterior dimension of ≤50% without morphological changes, togetherwith a benign mammogram, follow-up rather than an immediate biopsy can berecommended to reduce false-positive biopsy results. The risk of malignancy inlesions with a size increment but with no morphologic change on sonography isonly 1.9%, compatible with continued BI-RADS category 3 classification.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170787 PMID: 29658793  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
