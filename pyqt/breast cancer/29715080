The development of cancermolecular knowledge has surpassed the novel concept of cancer biology andunraveled principle targets for anticancer drug developments and treatmentstrategies. Metastatic breast cancer cells acquire their aggressive featuresthrough several mechanisms, including augmentation of survival, proliferation,tumorigenicity, and motility-related cellular pathways. Clearly, naturalproduct-derived compounds have since long been recognized as an important source for anticancer drugs, several of which have been shown to have promisinganti-metastasis activities by suppressing key molecular features supporting such cell aggressiveness. This review provides the essential details of breast cancer,the molecular-based insights into metastasis, as well as the effects andmechanisms of potential compounds for breast cancer therapeutic approaches. Asthe abilities of cancer cells to invade and metastasize are addressed as thehallmarks of cancer, compounds possessing anti-metastatic effects, together with their defined molecular drug action could benefit the development of new drugs aswell as treatment strategies.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12502 PMID: 29715080  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
