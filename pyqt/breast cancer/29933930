A subset of TNBC cases will have somatic amplification of chromosome9p24.1, encoding PD-L1, PD-L2, and JAK2, which has been associated with decreasedsurvival.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven TNBC cell lines were evaluated using arraycomparative genomic hybridization. A copy number gain was defined as an arraycomparative genomic hybridization log2 ratio of ≥ 1. Cell surface expression ofprogrammed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was detected using flow cytometry andcompared with the median fluorescence intensity of isotype controlimmunoglobulin. To selectively inhibit JAK2, lentiviral vectors encoding 2different short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were generated. JAK2, STAT1, STAT3,phosphorylated (p) STAT1, and pSTAT3 expression were measured by immunoblot.Statistical significance was defined as P < .05.RESULTS: The cell line HCC70 had 9p24.1 copy number amplification that wasassociated with both increased JAK2 and pSTAT3; however, knockdown of JAK2inhibited cell growth independently of 9p24.1 copy number status. In TNBC celllines with 9p24.1 gain or amplification, PD-L1 expression rapidly and strikingly increased 5- to 38-fold with interferon-γ (P < .05), and inducible PD-L1expression was completely blocked by JAK2 knockdown and the JAK1/2 inhibitorruxolitinib. In tumor tissue, expression of interferon-γ-related genes correlatedwith 9p24.1 copy number status.CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the JAK2/STAT1 pathway in TNBC might regulatethe dynamic expression of PD-L1 that is induced in the setting of an inflammatoryresponse. Inhibition of JAK2 might provide a synergistic therapy when combinedwith other immunotherapies in the subset of TNBC with 9p24.1 amplification.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
