Among the components of Rhodiola rosea, salidroside(p‑hydroxyphenethyl-β‑d-glucoside) is one of the most potent, and is present inall Rhodiola species. Recent data have revealed the anticancer effects ofsalidroside; however, the mechanism underlying its ability to inhibit tumorangiogenesis remains unknown. The present study aimed to analyze how salidroside affects major factors involved in breast cancer, and to elucidate its ability to inhibit angiogenesis and invasion. Signal transducer and activator oftranscription 3 (STAT3) is a marker for tumor angiogenesis and migration, whichinteracts with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Specifically, MMPs act as adownstream target for STAT3. Using western blotting and reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, the present study demonstrated that treatment of MDA‑MB 231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)cells with salidroside led to inhibition of invasion and migration markers, andof STAT3 signaling. Furthermore, in vitro angiogenesis analyses in humanumbilical vein endothelial cells confirmed the anti-angiogenic activity ofsalidroside. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay also demonstrated thatsalidroside may inhibit the DNA-binding activity of STAT3, preventing STAT3 from binding to a novel binding site of the MMP2 gene promoter. In conclusion, thepresent results demonstrated that salidroside may downregulate the STAT3signaling pathway, and inhibit cell viability, migration and invasion throughMMPs in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4430 PMID: 29901185
