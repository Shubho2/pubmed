Cancer that is diagnosed at early stages is more likely to be treatedsuccessfully. Treatment of progressed cancer is very difficult, and generallysurviving rates are much lower. Therefore, much research has been focused ondeveloping non-invasive methods for detection of cancer and monitoring of itsprogress. Within this contribution, we present a novel strategy for selectiveisolation and detection of breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and BT-20) based onsurface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). A simplified protocol based oncell-aptamer interaction has been developed in which core-shell (Au@Fe3O4)nanoparticles (CSNs) were functionalized with a mucin 1 (MUC1) specific aptamer(Apt1) to capture cells through the interaction between Apt1 and overexpressedprotein (MUC1) on the surface of the tumor cells. Meanwhile, a SERS nano-tag,synthesized by the conjugation of Apt1 to the surface of BSA coated and with4-mercaptopyridine (4-Mpy) functionalized gold nanoparticles, was used to detect the isolated cells. As a conclusion, the proposed strategy can be extended toisolate and detect cells more precisely based on the detection of different kindsof biomarkers on the surface of cancer cells, simultaneously.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
