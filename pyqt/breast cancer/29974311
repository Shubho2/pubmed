Synthesized compounds were screened foranticancer and antimicrobial activities. The compound 6c (LD50 19.1 µg/mL) showedanticancer activity higher than that of all other compounds against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Results of antimicrobial activities revealed that the compound 4d (MIC 0.5 μg/mL) had higher activity than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, whereas the compound 2b (MIC 0.5 μg/mL) had higher activity thanclotrimazole against Candida albicans. Overall results of this study envisagedthat the compounds 2b, 4d, and 6c have the potential to be developed asanticancer and antimicrobial agents. Novel pyrazolidine-3,5-dione derivatives(2a-g, 4a-g, and 6a-g) were synthesized via an easy-to perform Mg(II) catalysisin water medium. The synthesized compounds were screened for anticancer andantimicrobial activities.DOI: 10.1007/s11030-018-9850-3 PMID: 29974311
