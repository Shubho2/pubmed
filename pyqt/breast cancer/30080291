[Epub ahead of print]Esculentoside A suppresses breast cancer stem cell growth through stemnessattenuation and apoptosis induction by blocking IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway.Liu C(1), Dong L(2), Sun Z(1), Wang L(1), Wang Q(1), Li H(1), Zhang J(1), WangX(1).Author information: (1)Laboratory of Experimental Oncology, State Key Laboratory ofBiotherapy/Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, West China Hospital,West China Clinical Medical School, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.(2)Human Anatomy Department, School of Preclinical and Forensic Medcine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, China.Breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) survive in inflammatory microenvironment, theirsurvival are regulated by inflammatory cytokines and signaling pathways.Esculentoside A (EsA), a triterpene saponin derived from the root of Phytolaccaesculenta, possesses antiinflammation effects; but whether it has anticanceractivity is unknown. The purpose of this study is to test the inhibitory effectof EsA on the growth of breast CSCs and to elucidate its probable mechanisms ofaction. The proliferation inhibitory effect of EsA on breast CSCs in vitro weredetermined by cytotoxicity, mammosphere formation inhibition, apoptotic celldetection assays, and in vivo tumor growth inhibition experiment. The possiblemolecular mechanisms elucidating the inhibitory effect of EsA on breast CSCgrowth were examined with western blotting. EsA caused proliferation andmammosphere formation inhibition of breast CSCs; induced breast CSCs apoptoticdeath; suppressed the growth of tumors generated from breast CSCs significantly; the expressions of stemness proteins including ALDH1A1, Sox2, and Oct4 weredownregulated; proapoptotic proteins, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 were upregulated,whereas the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was reduced; IL-6/STAT3 pathway proteins including IL-6, phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705), and STAT3 (Ser727) weredownregulated significantly in EsA-treated breast CSCs and tumor tissues. EsAinhibited breast CSC growth in vitro and in vivo through stemness attenuation andapoptosis induction by blocking IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway; it might serve as anovel candidate agent for human breast cancer treatment and/or prevention.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6172 PMID: 30080291
