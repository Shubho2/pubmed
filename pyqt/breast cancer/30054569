We investigated the proportion of gross duplications occurring intandem in breast cancer predisposition genes with the intent of informing theirclassifications.METHODS: The DNA breakpoint assay (DBA) is a custom, paired-end, next-generation sequencing (NGS) method designed to capture and detect deep-intronic DNAbreakpoints in gross duplications in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CDH1, PALB2, and CHEK2.RESULTS: DBA allowed us to ascertain breakpoints for 44 unique gross duplicationsfrom 147 probands. We determined that the duplications occurred in tandem in 114 (78%) carriers from this cohort, while the remainder have unknown tandem status. Among the tandem gross duplications that were eligible for reclassification, 95% of them were upgraded to pathogenic.CONCLUSION: DBA is a novel, high-throughput, NGS-based method that informs thetandem status, and thereby the classification of, gross duplications. This methodrevealed that most gross duplications in the investigated genes occurred intandem and resulted in a pathogenic classification, which helps to secure thenecessary treatment options for their carriers.DOI: 10.1038/s41436-018-0092-7 PMID: 30054569
