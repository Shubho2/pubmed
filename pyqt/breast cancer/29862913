Lauderdale, Florida.BACKGROUND: Early detection and tracking of breast cancer treatment-relatedlymphedema have been helped by quantitative assessment methods and parameters,including bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy and tissue dielectric constant(TDC). Such measurements are evaluated with respect to interarm differences orratios that (when exceeding specified thresholds) are suggestive of lymphedema.Specific threshold ratios depend on the assessment method and have been reported for arms. However, there is far less information available on thresholds toassess lymphedema that manifests in at-risk hands and essentially nothing knownabout TDC ratios in healthy hands. Such information is essential to establishreference values from which lymphedema threshold TDC values may be estimated. Thespecific aim of this research was to determine such interhand TDC ratiosapplicable to both young and mature women.METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 70 women (35 under 30 years of age, YOUNG, and 35over 50 years of age, MATURE) participated after signing an approvedinstitutional review board informed consent. TDC values of the hand dorsum webwere measured bilaterally in triplicate with participants in a supine restingposition. Results showed MATURE TDC values to be about 15% less than YOUNG(p < 0.01) on dominant and nondominant hands, but no statistical difference indominant/nondominant interarm ratios (1.026 ± 0.100).CONCLUSIONS: Based on this data set's overall mean and two standard deviationvalue, an age-independent interhand TDC threshold ratio of 1.23 emerges aspotentially useful for lymphedema detection. This is a good initial startthreshold that is usable in future clinical and research assessments.DOI: 10.1089/lrb.2017.0065 PMID: 29862913
