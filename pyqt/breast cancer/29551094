The development of interventions would benefit from a better understanding of the reasons for adherence and thecausal relationships of determinants using theoretical or model approaches. Theaim of the present study was to identify reasons for AET adherence in breastcancer patients with sequential relationships and inter-relationships.METHODS: A total of 210 participants with estrogen receptor positive breastcancer who received AET completed a questionnaire assessing demographic/medical, psychological, and endocrine therapy (ET)-specific factors. A descriptiveanalysis was performed to identify meaningful variables. Selected variables were subjected to hierarchical regression and path analyses. The path model was testedand modified based on the research framework and the results of regressionweights and model fit.RESULTS: Analysis of sequential effects showed that ET-specific factorscontributed the largest proportion of variance (13.4%) to predict AET adherence, followed by psychological factors (4.6%) and demographic/medical factors (3.1%). Analysis of inter-relationships showed that demographic/medical factors such asAET regimen type and cancer stage have direct effects on AET adherence, whereaspsychological factors contribute indirectly through the mediating effects ofET-specific factors.CONCLUSION: Assessments and interventions that encompass the patient's medicationbeliefs, self-efficacy, and depression are needed to promote AET adherence.DOI: 10.1186/s12905-018-0522-3 PMCID: PMC5858147PMID: 29551094
