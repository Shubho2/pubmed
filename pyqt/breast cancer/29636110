Cell fusion, which applies to both the proteins and conditions that induce the merging of two or more cells, is not a fully understood process. Inflammation/pro-inflammatorycytokines might be a positive trigger for cell fusion. Using a Cre-LoxP-basedcell fusion assay we demonstrated that the fusion between human M13SV1-Cre breastepithelial cells and human MDA-MB-435-pFDR1 cancer cells was induced by thepro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).METHODS: The gene expression profile of the cells in the presence of TNF-α andunder normoxic and hypoxic conditions was analysed by cDNA microarray analysis.cDNA microarray data were verified by qPCR, PCR, Western blot and zymography.Quantification of cell fusion events was determined by flow cytometry. Proteinsof interest were either blocked or knocked-down using a specific inhibitor, siRNAor a blocking antibody.RESULTS: The data showed an up-regulation of various genes, including claudin-1(CLDN1), ICAM1, CCL2 and MMP9 in M13SV1-Cre and/or MDA-MB-435-pFDR1 cells.Inhibition of these proteins using a blocking ICAM1 antibody, CLDN1 siRNA or anMMP9 inhibitor showed that only the blockage of MMP9 was correlated with adecreased fusion rate of the cells. Likewise, the tetracycline-based antibioticminocycline, which exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, was also effective inboth inhibiting the TNF-α-induced MMP9 expression in M13SV1-Cre cells andblocking the TNF-α-induced fusion frequency of human M13SV1-Cre breast epithelialcells and human MDA-MB-435-pFDR1 cancer cells.CONCLUSIONS: The matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) is most likely involved in theTNF-α-mediated fusion of human M13SV1-Cre breast epithelial cells and humanMDA-MB-435-pFDR1 cancer cells. Likewise, our data indicate that thetetracycline-based antibiotic minocycline might exhibit anti-fusogenic propertiesbecause it inhibits a cell fusion-related mechanism.DOI: 10.1186/s12964-018-0226-1 PMCID: PMC5894245PMID: 29636110
