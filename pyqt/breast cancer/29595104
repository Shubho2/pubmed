In addition to its toxicity in thegastrointestinal tract and central/peripheral nervous system, metronidazole hasbeen reported to cause mucosal imbalance by affecting the expression of mucin(Muc2 gene), which is responsible to form an insoluble mucous barrier thatprotects the gut lumen from microbial colonization. Since metronidazole is anitro-group containing compound and used significantly for therapeutic purposes, scientists evaluated its carcinogenicity in different preclinical in-vitro andin-vivo studies. In addition to the preclinical in-vitro validation of DNAdamage, metronidazole has been reported to induce cancer in the variety of animalmodels including lung cancer, malignant lymphomas, breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pituitary tumors, testicular neoplasms and uterine cancer. Severalretrospective cohort studies have reported metronidazole as a potential riskfactor for lung cancer (n = 771), cervical cancer (n = 2500), breast cancer (n = 2), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1), and neuroblastoma (n = 28). So far, all thereported data have confirmed metronidazole carcinogenicity in animals; however,it is still controversial in humans. Based on previous observations, theoxidative metabolites from metronidazole metabolism are shown to have morecarcinogenic effects than the parent drug itself. Since ~40% of drug metabolismis reliant on cytochromes, the inter-patient' differences in metronidazolemetabolism potentially indicate the individual susceptibility to developingcancer. Due to these potent carcinogenic behaviors, use of metronidazole foranimals treatment and its uses in animal food products are barred in the USA and European countries; however, its clinical use in human population is increasing. For this purpose, updated and improved research studies are required to explicateits mechanism/s involved in carcinogenesis.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1389200219666180329124130 PMID: 29595104
