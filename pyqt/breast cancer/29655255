Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a newtumour vascular supply pattern that significantly influences tumour metastasisand contributes to a poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanism of therelationship between TP53INP1 and breast cancer VM formation is unknown. Here, weexplored the underlying mechanism by which TP53INP1 regulates VM formationin vitro and in vivo. High TP53INP1 expression was not only negatively correlatedwith a poor prognosis but also had a negative relationship with VE-cadherin,HIF-1α and Snail expression. TP53INP1 overexpression inhibited breast cancerinvasion, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and VM formation;conversely, TP53INP1 down-regulation promoted these processes in vitro byfunctional experiments and Western blot analysis. We established a hypoxia model induced by CoCl2 and assessed the effects of TP53INP1 on hypoxia-induced EMT and VM formation. In addition, we confirmed that a reactive oxygen species(ROS)-mediated signalling pathway participated in TP53INP1-mediated VM formation.Together, our results show that TP53INP1 inhibits hypoxia-induced EMT and VMformation via the ROS/GSK-3β/Snail pathway in breast cancer, which offers newinsights into breast cancer clinical therapy.© 2018 The Authors.
