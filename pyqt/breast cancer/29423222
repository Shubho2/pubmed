Bone marrow metastases from breast cancer arenot rare, and they may lead to serious life-threatening conditions when there is an associated hematological disorder. Therefore, DCBM necessitates a definitivediagnosis and prompt systemic therapy. We herein present 4 such cases and areview of the previous relevant literature. Bone marrow biopsy is an effectivemethod for diagnosing DCBM, and it may also be useful for selecting the optimaltherapy. The malignant cells in the bone marrow biopsy specimens from all 4patients were negative for progesterone receptor expression, and in 1 case, humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu expression was discordant between theprimary tumor and the bone marrow metastases. Patients with DCBM often requiregranulocyte colony-stimulating factor and/or blood transfusions due to aDCBM-related hematological disorder. Although systemic chemotherapy for DCBM may temporarily exacerbate the need for hematological support, systemic chemotherapy may be effective for DCBM in breast cancer patients. In our experience, endocrinetherapy has also been proven effective for DCBM. The aim of the present study wasto review the clinical characteristics and the treatments used in 4 breast cancerpatients with DCBM.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2017.1502 PMCID: PMC5772957PMID: 29423222
