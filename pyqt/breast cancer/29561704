Theexpressions of miR-144 and CEP55 in 40 adjacent tissues and 36 tumor tissues wereexamined by western blot, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The targetrelationship between miR-144 and CEP55 was predicted and confirmed by TargetScan and luciferase reporter assay. The cell proliferation, cell cycle and cellapoptosis in different groups were detected by MTT and flow cytometry assays,while wound healing and transwell assays were used for the cell migration andinvasion tests. The regulatory effects of miR-144 and CEP55 on breast tumor were verified through nude mouse model in vivo experiment.RESULTS: MiR-144 was down-regulated in breast cancerous tissues and cells,whereas CEP55 expression was up-regulated in breast cancerous tissues. Moreover, there existed a target relationship between miR-144 and CEP55 and negativecorrelation on their expressions. MiR-144 could down-regulate CEP55 expression,thereby inhibiting proliferation, invasion, migration, retarding cell cycle andaccelerating cell apoptosis. MiR-144 could inhibit cell progression throughdown-regulating CEP55 in vivo.CONCLUSION: MiR-144 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion andinduced cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis by repressing CEP55. This mightprovide a promising therapy for clinical treatment.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2017.1416934 PMCID: PMC5902245 [Available on 2019-03-26]PMID: 29561704
