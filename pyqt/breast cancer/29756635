We assessedchanges in the use of breast cancer screening 2007-2012 in Switzerland, andassociations with socioeconomic and health-related determinants.METHODS: We used the nationwide and representative data from the Swiss HealthSurveys 2007 and 2012. We analysed the self-reported use of mammography in thelast 12 months (proportion of population) among women aged 40-79 years, andopportunistic (without clinical symptoms, initiated by the woman or a physician) and programmatic screening mammography (as part of a systematic screeningprogramme). We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses (presented as adjusted odds ratios, aORs).RESULTS: The use of any mammography in the last 12 months declined from 19.1%(95% confidence interval [CI] 17.7-20.5%) in 2007 to 11.7% (95% CI 10.7-12.6%) in2012. This decline was more pronounced in regions with a long-standing or nocantonal breast cancer screening programme (aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.6, and aOR 0.5,95% CI 0.4-0.6, respectively), but remained relatively stable in regions with arecently introduced programme (aOR 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.3, p-value from test forinteraction 0.01). Opportunistic screening dropped from 12.0% (95% CI 10.9-13.2%)in 2007 to 6.2% (95% CI 5.5-6.9%; p <0.001) in 2012, whereas the use ofprogrammatic mammography remained stable at 3.1% (95% CI 2.6-3.7%). Use of anymammography was higher in women aged 50-69 years, residing in a region with asystematic screening programme in place, and women having a private hospital stayinsurance, but was not associated with education level and non-Swiss citizenship.CONCLUSIONS: Overall attendance of breast cancer screening is low in Switzerland and decreased between 2007 and 2012, despite expanding cantonal mammographyscreening programmes. Many factors may have contributed to this decline,including the ongoing scientific and public debates on the value of breast cancerscreening.DOI: 10.4414/smw.2018.14603 PMID: 29756635
