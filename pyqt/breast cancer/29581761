Methods: In the conventional method, a circularregion of interest was drawn manually onto the map reflecting the maximum slopeof increase (MSI) to delineate the suspicious lesions. The mean TIC wasdetermined subjectively as one of three different wash-out patterns. In the newmethod, the lesion area was identified semi-automatically. The mean TIC wascategorized quantitatively. In addition to the MSI, other quantitative parameterswere calculated, including the signal intensity slope (SIslope), initialpercentage of enhancement (Einitial), percentage of peak enhancement (Epeak),early signal enhancement ratio (ESER), and second enhancement percentage (SEP).The performances were compared with receiver operating characteristic (ROC)analysis and Wilcoxon's test. Results: For TIC categorization results, thediagnostic accuracy rates were 61.54% with the traditional manual method and76.92% with the new method. For the mean MSI values from the manual method, theaccuracy was 63.41%. For the mean TIC derived using the semi-automatic method,the diagnostic accuracy were 82.05% for SIslope, 67.31% for MSI, 61.53% forEinitial, 64.75% for Epeak, 64.74% for ESER, and 52.56% for SEP, respectively.For the lesion regions identified by the semi-automatic method, the diagnosticaccuracy for above mentioned parameters were 80.13%, 69.87%, 61.54%, 63.47%,64.74% and 55.13%, respectively. Conclusion: With respect to the analysis of TIC from breast DCE-MRI, the results demonstrated that the new method increased thediagnostic accuracy, and should be considered as a supplementary tool fordistinguishing benign and malignant lesions.DOI: 10.7150/jca.23283 PMCID: PMC5868147PMID: 29581761
