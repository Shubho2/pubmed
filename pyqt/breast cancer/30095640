The purpose of this review was to discuss the current status of clinical research regarding the use ofacupuncture as a part of traditional Korean medicine (KM) for various symptomsassociated with breast cancer therapies.METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of acupuncture as a part of traditional KM to treat symptoms associated with breast cancer therapies. The following databases were searched for content up toFebruary 2017: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, 4 Korean databases, andconference proceedings from major Korean medical societies.RESULTS: Among the 1228 identified articles, 8 observational studies (3 caseseries and 5 case reports), and 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) were includedin this review. Among these studies, 3 investigated lymphedema, 2 investigatedchemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, 1 investigated hot flushes, 1investigated constipation, and 2 investigated miscellaneous symptoms in breastcancer survivors; all studies concluded that acupuncture can alleviate thesymptom in question. However, we identified only 1 relevant RCT, and the includedstudies had limitations in terms of reporting quality.CONCLUSION: There is a lack of conclusive evidence regarding the benefits ofacupuncture for the treatment of breast cancer survivors in Korea. More rigorous RCTs are necessary in the future to establish stronger clinical evidenceregarding the use of acupuncture to better reflect the clinical context of Korea.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011793 PMID: 30095640
