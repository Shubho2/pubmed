Despite the improvements indetection and treatment of breast cancer, the vast majority of breast cancerpatients are diagnosed with metastatic disease either at the beginning of thedisease or later during treatment. Still, the molecular mechanisms causing atherapy resistant metastatic breast cancer are still elusive. In the presentstudy we addressed the function of the transcriptional activator ZRF1 duringbreast cancer progression. We provide evidence that ZRF1 plays an essential role for the early metastatic events in vitro and acts like a tumor suppressor proteinduring the progression of breast invasive ductal carcinoma into a more advancedstage. Hence, depletion of ZRF1 results in the acquisition of metastatic behaviorby facilitating the initiation of the metastatic cascade, notably for celladhesion, migration and invasion. Furthermore absence of ZRF1 provokes endocrine resistance via misregulation of cell death and cell survival related pathways.Taken together, we have identified ZRF1 as an important regulator of breastcancer progression that holds the potential to be explored for new treatmentstrategies in the future.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25596 PMCID: PMC6033359PMID: 29983888
