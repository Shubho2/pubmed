However,mortality associated with sepsis still remains higher (25-30%) that furtherincreases to 40-50% in the presence of septic shock. For example,sepsis-associated deaths account more in comparison to deaths-associated withmyocardial-infarction and certain cancers (i.e. breast and colorectal cancer).However, it is now well established that profound activation of innate immunecells including macrophages play a very important role in the immunopathogenesis of sepsis. Macrophages are sentinel cells of the innate immune system with their location varying from peripheral blood to various target organs including lungs, liver, brain, kidneys, skin, testes, vascular endothelium etc. Thus, profound anddysregulated activation of these cells during sepsis can directly impact theoutcome of sepsis. However, the emergence of the concept of immunometabolism as amajor controller of immune response has raised a new hope for identifying newtargets for immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches. Thus this present reviewstarts with an introduction of sepsis as a major medical problem worldwide andsignifies the role of dysregulated innate immune response including macrophagesin its immunopathogenesis. Thereafter, subsequent sections describe changes inimmunometabolic stage of macrophages (both M1 and M2) during sepsis. The article ends with the discussion of novel macrophage-specific therapeutic targetstargeting their immunometabolism during sepsis and epigenetic regulation ofmacrophage immunometabolism and vice versa.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
