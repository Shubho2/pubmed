The aim of the present work wasto examine changes in nitric oxide (NO)- and prostacyclin (PGI2)-dependentendothelial function in the systemic conduit artery (aorta), in relation to theformation of lung metastases and to local and systemic inflammation in a murineorthotopic model of metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: BALB/c female mice were orthotopically inoculated with 4T1 breast cancercells. Development of lung metastases, lung inflammation, changes in blood count,systemic inflammatory response (e.g. SAA, SAP and IL-6), as well as changes inNO- and PGI2-dependent endothelial function in the aorta, were examined 2, 4, 5and 6 weeks following cancer cell transplantation.RESULTS: As early as 2 weeks following transplantation of breast cancer cells, inthe early metastatic stage, lungs displayed histopathological signs ofinflammation, NO production was impaired and nitrosylhemoglobin concentration in plasma was decreased. After 4 to 6 weeks, along with metastatic development,progressive leukocytosis and systemic inflammation (as seen through increasedSAA, SAP, haptoglobin and IL-6 plasma concentrations) were observed. Six weeksfollowing cancer cell inoculation, but not earlier, endothelial dysfunction inaorta was detected; this involved a decrease in basal NO production and adecrease in NO-dependent vasodilatation, that was associated with a compensatory increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)- derived PGI2 production.CONCLUSIONS: In 4 T1 metastatic breast cancer in mice early pulmonary metastasis was correlated with lung inflammation, with an early decrease in pulmonary aswell as systemic NO availability. Late metastasis was associated with robust,cancer-related, systemic inflammation and impairment of NO-dependent endothelial function in the aorta that was associated with compensatory upregulation of theCOX-2-derived PGI2 pathway.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4445-z PMCID: PMC5964697PMID: 29788918
