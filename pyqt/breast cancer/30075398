Electronic address:gana@niperhyd.ac.in.Olaparib (OLA) is a poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) enzyme inhibitor used totreat prostate, ovarian and breast cancer. The drug substance OLA was subjectedto forced degradation as per ICH prescribed guidelines. It was degraded inhydrolytic (acidic and basic) and oxidative stress conditions and yielded fourdegradation products (DPs) while it remained stable in neutral hydrolytic, dryheat and photolytic stress conditions. A stability indicating assay method wasdeveloped to separate OLA and its DPs using InertSustain C18 column(250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) with a gradient mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH4.5) and acetonitrile (ACN) at a flow rate of 1 mL min-1. The characterization ofDPs was carried out by using liquid chromatography-electrosprayionization-quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry(LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS). Major degradation products (DP-1 and DP-2) were isolated byusing preparative HPLC and structures were further confirmed by using NMRspectroscopy. All the obtained DPs were new and not reported previously. Thedeveloped chromatographic method was validated as per ICH Q2 (R1) guideline andUSP general chapter on method validation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
