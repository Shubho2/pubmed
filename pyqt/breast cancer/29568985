The majority of BC-relateddeaths is due to metastasis. Bone, lung, brain and liver are the primary targetsites of BC metastasis. The clinical implications and mechanisms underlying bone metastasis have been reviewed before. Given the fact that BC lung metastasis(BCLM) usually produces symptoms only after the lungs have been vastly occupiedwith metastatic tumor masses, it is of paramount importance for diagnostic andprognostic, as well as therapeutic purposes to comprehend the molecular andcellular mechanisms underlying BCLM. Here, we review current insights into theorgan-specificity of BC metastasis, including the role of cancer stem cells intriggering BC spread, the traveling of tumor cells in the blood stream and their migration across endothelial barriers, their adaptation to the lungmicroenvironment and the initiation of metastatic colonization within the lung.CONCLUSIONS: Detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying BCLM will shed anew light on the identification of novel molecular targets to impede dauntingpulmonary metastases in patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s13402-018-0376-6 PMID: 29568985
