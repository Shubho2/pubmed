Despite emerging research suggesting physical activity as a treatment for cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), little is known about the interactive effects ofbehaviors across the 24-h period. The present purpose was to examine thecognitive effects of reallocating sedentary time to light-intensity physicalactivity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), or sleep in breastcancer survivors.METHODS: Breast cancer survivors (N = 271, Mage = 57.81 ± 9.50 years) completediPad-based questionnaires and cognitive tasks assessing demographics, healthhistory, executive function, and processing speed (Task-Switch, Trail Making).Participants wore an accelerometer for seven consecutive days to measure theirsedentary, physical activity, and sleep behaviors. Single effects (each behavior individually) and partition (controlling for other behaviors) models were used toexamine associations among behaviors and cognitive performance. Isotemporalsubstitution models were used to test the cognitive effects of substituting30 min of sedentary time with 30 min of light-intensity activity, MVPA, andsleep.RESULTS: MVPA was associated with faster Task-switch reaction time in thepartition models (stay: B = - 35.31, p = 0.02; switch: B = - 48.24, p = 0.004).Replacing 30 min of sedentary time with 30 min of MVPA yielded faster reactiontimes on Task-Switch stay (B = - 29.37, p = 0.04) and switch (B = - 39.49,p = 0.02) trials. In Trails A single effects models, sedentary behavior wasassociated with faster completion (B = - 0.97, p = 0.03) and light-intensityactivity with slower completion (B = 1.25, p = 0.006). No single effects wereobserved relative to Trails B completion (all p > 0.05). Only the effect of MVPA was significant in the partition models (Trails A: B = - 3.55, p = 0.03; TrailsB: B = - 4.46, p = 0.049). Replacing sedentary time with light-intensity activitywas associated with slower Trails A (B = 1.55 p = 0.002) and Trails B (B = 1.69, p = 0.02) completion. Replacing light activity with MVPA yielded faster Trails A (B = - 4.35, p = 0.02) and Trails B (B = - 5.23, p = 0.03) completion.CONCLUSIONS: Findings support previous research suggesting MVPA may be needed to improve cognitive function in breast cancer survivors. Trails findings underscorethe need to dissect sedentary contexts to better understand the impact of dailybehavioral patterns on CRCI. Additional research investigating the cognitiveimpacts of behaviors across the 24-h period is warranted.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered with United StatesClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02523677 ; 8/14/2015).DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4603-3 PMCID: PMC6019533PMID: 29940894
