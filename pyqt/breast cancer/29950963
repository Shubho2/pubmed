Active vaccination is a promising strategy, especiallyin tumors that have a specific tumor-associated antigen. Although cellularimmunotherapies have not yet shown efficacy, new technologies are on the way toimprove this approach. Given the recent Food and Drug Administration approval of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells for leukemia, it is only a question oftime before solid tumors will follow. However, not all breast cancer patientswill respond to cellular or other immunotherapy. Hence, we must definesubpopulations of breast cancer patients who benefit from this new approach.DOI: 10.1159/000486330 PMCID: PMC6016061 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29950963
