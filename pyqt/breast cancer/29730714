The instruments used werethe European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core 30 and itsbreast cancer (BC) module, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Brief PainInventory (BPI), the Scale for Mood Assessment (EVEA), the International Fitness Scale (IFIS), and the Charlson Comorbidity Index.RESULTS: The analysis revealed that 41.2% of LTBCS were considered moderatelyfatigued and showed significantly higher levels for the categories of "nausea andvomiting" (P = .005), "pain," "dyspnea" and "insomnia" (P < .001), "appetiteloss" (P = .002), "financial difficulties" (P = .010), "systemic therapy sideeffects" (P < .001), "breast symptoms" and "arm symptoms" (P = .002), and "upset by hair loss" (P = .016). In addition, LTBCS presented significantly higherlevels of pain in the affected and non-affected arm, "sadness-depression.""anxiety," "anger/hostility" (All: P < .001), and lower general physical fitness (P < .001). The rest of the variables did not show significant differences.CONCLUSION: LTBCS suffering from higher levels of fatigue had lower QoL, higherlevel of pain, worse mood state, and lower physical fitness.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4240-z PMID: 29730714
