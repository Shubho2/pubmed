Sp1 is a negative prognostic factor for pancreatic, colon, glioma,gastric, breast, prostate, and lung cancer patients. Functional studies alsodemonstrate that Sp TFs regulate genes responsible for cancer cell growth,survival, migration/invasion, inflammation and drug resistance, and Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are also nononcogene addiction (NOA) genes and important drug targets. Themechanisms of drug-induced downregulation of Sp TFs and pro-oncogenicSp-regulated genes are complex and include ROS-dependent epigenetic pathways thatinitially decrease expression of the oncogene cMyc. Many compounds such ascurcumin, aspirin, and metformin that are active in cancer prevention alsoexhibit chemotherapeutic activity and these compounds downregulate Sp TFs incancer cell lines and tumors. The effects of these compounds on downregulation ofSp TFs in normal cells and the contribution of this response to theirchemopreventive activity have not yet been determined.
