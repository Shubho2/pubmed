However, this was stopped after only 14 days due to Grade 4neutropenia. She was then started on vaccine therapy with Survivin 2B peptide(SVN-2B) including IFA and INF-α. Although metastatic lung tumors were identifiedand resected at 82 months after surgery, the patient has remained free of new or relapsed disease for 12 years thereafter. Tetramer and ELISPOT assays revealedthe continuous circulation of SVN-2B-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) inher peripheral blood, and CTL clones had specific activity for SVN-2B at 12 yearsafter surgery. The adverse effects of the peptide vaccination were tolerable and comprised low-grade headache, nausea, and fatigue. A prognosis beyond 10 years inthe face of pancreatic cancer with distant metastasis is extremely rare. Thisexperience might indicate the value of cancer vaccination therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00262-018-2217-x PMID: 30069687
