Therefore, it is essential to exploreprofessionals' views of the acceptability of this new programme, since this mayaffect shared decision-making.METHODS: Professionals from three European countries (the Netherlands, UnitedKingdom, and Sweden) participated in digital concept mapping, a systematic mixed methods approach used to explore complex multidimensional constructs.RESULTS: Across the three countries, professionals prioritised the following fivethemes which may impact decision-making from the perspective of eligible women:(1) Anxiety/worry; (2) Proactive approach; (3) Reassurance; (4) Lack ofknowledge; and (5) Organisation of risk assessment and feedback. Furthermore,Dutch and British professionals expressed concerns regarding the acceptability ofa heterogeneous screening policy, suggesting women will question their riskfeedback and assigned pathway of care. Swedish professionals emphasised thepotential impact of the programme on family relations.CONCLUSIONS: The perspectives of Dutch, British, and Swedish professionals ofwomen's decision-making regarding personalised breast cancer screening andprevention generally appear in line with women's own views of acceptability aspreviously reported. This will facilitate shared decision-making. However,concerns regarding potential consequences of this new programme for screeningoutcomes and organisation need to be addressed, since this may affect howprofessionals communicate the programme to eligible women.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197772 PMCID: PMC5983562PMID: 29856760
