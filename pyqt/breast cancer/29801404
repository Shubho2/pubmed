Email: hdavoodi1345@gmail.comBackground: Breast cancer (BrCa) is the most common cancer among women worldwide and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women, in developedcountries. This cancer is among the top five most common cancers in Iran. Studieshave shown that dietary components are implicated in the etiology of BrCa. Theexistence of molecular connections between inflammation and BrCa has beendemonstrated via different bimolecular events. Methods: We examined the abilityof the dietary inflammatory index (DIITM) to predict the risk of BrCa. Thisincluded 145 cases and 148 controls, who attended the specialized centers. DIIscores were computed based on dietary intake assessed using a 168-item FFQ.Logistic regression models were used to estimate multivariable ORs. Results:Modeling DII as a continuous variable in relation to risk of BrCa showed apositive association after adjustment for age and energy (OR=1.76; 95%CI=1.43-2.18); and were nearly identical in the multivariable analyses (OR=1.80; 95% CI=1.42-2.28). DII as tertiles, and adjusting for age and energy, subjects intertile 3 had an OR of 6.94 (95% CI= 3.26-14.79; P-trend ≤0.0001) in comparisonto subjects in tertile 1. After multivariable adjustment, results wereessentially identical as in the model adjusting for age and energy (OR tertile3vs1=7.24; 95% CI=3.14-16.68; P-trend ≤0.001). Sub group analyses revealedsimilar positive associations with HER 2 receptor +ve, progesterone receptor +ve,estrogen receptor +ve and lymph node invasive cases. Conclusion: Subjects whoconsumed a more pro-inflammatory diet were at increased risk of BrCa compared to those who consumed a more anti-inflammatory diet.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.5.1215 PMCID: PMC6031848PMID: 29801404
