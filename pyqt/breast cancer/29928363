China.Endothelial selectin (ELAM1 or CD62E) has been previously reported as beingassociated with the prognosis of multiple types of cancer. However, itsprognostic value in breast cancer (BC) remains unclear. The aim of the presentstudy was to investigate the prognostic value of ELAM1 mRNA expression in BCtissue. The prognostic value of ELAM1 mRNA was assessed in patients with BC usingthe Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM-plot) database. The KM-plot generated updated ELAM1 mRNA expression data and survival analysis from a total of 3,951 patients withBC, gathered from 35 datasets. Low expression of ELAM1 mRNA was correlated with apoorer overall survival in 1,402 patients with BC followed for 20 years [hazardratio (HR), 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57-0.88; log-rank P=0.0016].Low expression of ELAM1 was also correlated with poorer relapse-free survival(HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62-0.77; log-rank P=2.2e-11) in 3,951 patients and poorerdistant metastasis-free survival (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.96; log-rank P=0.02)in 1,746 patients with BC followed for 20 years. Results from the Metabolic gEne RApid visualizer database indicated that ELAM1 mRNA expression was elevated innormal tissue. The results of the present study suggest that ELAM1 mRNA is apotential prognostic and metastatic marker in patients with BC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8570 PMCID: PMC6004648PMID: 29928363
