Indian J Exp Biol. 2016 Oct;54(10):619-629.Breast cancer: Role of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 expression in prognostication.Raval A, Trivedi S.Deregulation of Insulin like growth factors (IGF) is an>important determinant of breast carcinogenesis. Circulatory IGF-1 (potent breast mitogen) and IGFBP-3 (itsregulator) are exteisively evaluated; few studies report transcript copynumbers.(CN) from ex-vivo samples. This study from 106 patients evaluated mRNAexpression (qRT-PCR CN) of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 for prognostic and predictiveutility from tumor, adjacent normal tissues (ANT) and lymph nodes. Thedifferences in.IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 mRNA levels (CN/Î¼g RNA) were juxtaposed toclinical and pathologic variables and survival. Tumors expressed lower IGF-1 and higher IGFBP-3 as compared to ANT. Both transcript levels decreased withincreasing age. Primary tumors with nodal involvement, Invasive Lobular carcinoma(ILC) histology and stromal involvement showed increased transcript levels thantheir respective counterparts. Moreover, surviving patients showing no relapsehad higher expression of both molecules. Early stage and necrosed tumorsexpressed higher IGFBP-3 while a trend of lower expression was seen as tumorgrade advanced. IGF-1 expression was inversely correlated to stage, histologicgrade and. Significantly different Relapse Free Survival (RFS) was seen withIGFBP-3 up-/down-regulation considering progesterone receptor (PR) status but notestrogen receptor (ER) and HER-2 while the Overall Survival (OS) was similar for both these molecules. We conclude that expression of these molecules may aidprognostication and success of anti IGF-1 strategies.PMID: 30084561
