Sedentarybehavior is now acknowledged to be a risk factor for cancer and cancer relapse.Currently, there are different approaches to increasing the effectiveness oflong-term physical activity in these patients. The aim of this study was toverify the long-term effectiveness of a home-based program for active lifestylechange in overweight breast cancer survivors.METHODS: We enrolled 43 women (age 51.5±9.9 years), who underwent an evaluationof their spontaneous physical activity levels, their baseline aerobic capacitythrough a 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT), their flexibility, grip and lower limbstrength, and their body composition. We repeated the measurements of thesephysical and anthropometric parameters six times during one year of unsupervised exercise.RESULTS: At the beginning of the program the sample showed a moderate level ofspontaneous physical activity (physical activity level=1.44±0.12,steps/day=7420.3±1622.3). After being prescribed an individual exercise program, a significant reduction in BMI (T0=27.9±4.3, T5= 25.8±3.0 kg/m2; p<0.001) andskinfold sum was observed (T0=99.5±25.2, T5=86.2±22.7 mm; p=0.019), with aparallel maintenance of cell mass (T0= 21.4±3.3, T5= 22.5±3.0 kg; p=0.654). Thefunctional parameters showed an increase in lower limb muscle fitness and areduction in diastolic blood pressure after 6 MWT (T0= 78.4±10.1, T5= 72.5±14.9mmhg; p=0.032).CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity is recommended for cancer patients; this model of prescribing unsupervised exercise seems to ensure optimal compliance, thusallowing long-term therapeutic efficacy.DOI: 10.23736/S0022-4707.18.08131-8 PMID: 29498250
