Metastatic cancer cells find optimal paths of minimal resistance throughan adaptive path-finding process, which leads to successful dissemination. Thephysical limit of nuclear deformation is related to the minimal cross section of pores that can be successfully penetrated. However, this single biophysicalparameter does not fully describe the architectural complexity of tissuesfeaturing pores of variable area and shape. Here, employing lasernanolithography, we fabricate pore microenvironment models with well-controlledpore shapes, through which human breast cells (MCF10A) and their metastaticoffspring (MCF10CA1a.cl1) could pervade. In these experimental settings, wedemonstrate that the actual pore shape, and not only the cross section, is amajor and independent determinant of cancer penetration efficiency. In complexarchitectures containing pores demanding large deformations from invading cells, tall and narrow rectangular openings facilitate cancer migration. In addition, wehighlight the characteristic traits of the explorative behavior enablingmetastatic cells to identify and select such pore shapes in a complex multishape pore environment, pinpointing paths of least resistance to invasion.DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b00431 PMID: 29480726
