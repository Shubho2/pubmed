Investigating cancer risk in these biologically relevant subsets may provide an opportunity to develop personalised cancer screening guidelines.In this study, we examined cancer risk in distinct serologic and phenotypicscleroderma subsets and compared estimates with the general population.METHODS: Patients in the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center observational cohortwere studied. Overall and site-specific cancer incidence was calculated indistinct autoantibody and scleroderma phenotypic subsets, and compared with theSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry, a representative sample ofthe US population.RESULTS: 2383 patients with scleroderma contributing 37 686 person-years werestudied. 205 patients (8.6%) had a diagnosis of cancer. Within 3 years ofscleroderma onset, cancer risk was increased in patients with RNA polymerase III autoantibodies (antipol; standardised incidence ratio (SIR) 2.84, 95% CI 1.89 to 4.10) and those lacking centromere, topoisomerase-1 and pol antibodies (SIR 1.83,95% CI 1.10 to 2.86). Among antipol-positive patients, cancer-specific risk mayvary by scleroderma subtype; those with diffuse scleroderma had an increasedbreast cancer risk, whereas those with limited scleroderma had high lung cancerrisk. In contrast, patients with anticentromere antibodies had a lower risk ofcancer during follow-up (SIR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.76).CONCLUSIONS: Autoantibody specificity and disease subtype are biologicallymeaningful filters that may inform cancer risk stratification in patients withscleroderma. Future research testing the value of targeted cancer screeningstrategies in patients with scleroderma is needed.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
