However, optimal values for compression force are not known, and studies have found large variation in use of compression forcesbetween breast centres and radiographers. We investigated breast compressionparameters, including compression force, compression pressure and compressedbreast thickness across four consecutive full field digital mammography screeningexaminations for 25,143 subsequently screened females aged 50-69 years.  Methods:Information from females attending four consecutive screening examinations at twobreast centres in BreastScreen Norway during January 2007 - March 2016 wasavailable. We compared the changes in compression force, compression pressure andcompressed breast thickness from the first to fourth consecutive screeningexamination, stratified by craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO)view.  Results: Compression force, compression pressure and compressed breastthickness increased relatively by 18.3, 14.4 and 8.4% respectively, from first tofourth consecutive screening examination in CC view (p<0.001 for all). For MLOview, the values increased relatively by 12.3% for compression force, 9.9% forcompression pressure and 6.9% for compressed breast thickness from first tofourth consecutive screening examination (p<0.001 for all).  Conclusion: Weobserved increasing values of breast compression parameters across consecutivescreening examinations. Further research should investigate the effect of thisvariation on image quality and females' experiences of discomfort and pain. Advances in knowledge: Breast compression force, compression pressure andcompressed breast thickness increased across consecutive screening examinations, which might be of influence for the females' experiences of discomfort and painduring the examination and for image quality.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20180209 PMID: 29927636
