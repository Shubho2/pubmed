Recently,aquaporins have been proposed as mediators of cancer cell biology. A subset ofaquaporins, referred to as aquaglyceroporins are known to facilitate thetransport of glycerol. The present study describes the effect of gene knockdownof the aquaglyceroporin AQP3 on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation,migration, invasion, adherence and response to the chemotherapeutic agent5-fluorouracil. shRNA mediated AQP3 gene knockdown induced a 28% reduction incellular proliferation (P<0.01), a 39% decrease in migration (P<0.0001), a 24%reduction in invasion (P<0.05) and a 25% increase in cell death at 100 ÂµM 5-FU(P<0.01). Analysis of cell permeability to water and glycerol revealed thatMDA-MB-231 cells with knocked down AQP3 demonstrated a modest decrease in waterpermeability (17%; P<0.05) but a more marked decrease in glycerol permeability(77%; P<0.001). These results suggest that AQP3 has a role in multiple aspects ofbreast cancer cell pathophysiology and therefore represents a novel target fortherapeutic intervention.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8759 PMCID: PMC6019904PMID: 29963136
