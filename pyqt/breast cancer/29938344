Variation in the genes involved inpharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of these drugs plays an important role inprediction of drug response and survival. The present study was carried out with an aim to evaluate the variation in all the genes involved in pharmacokinetic andpharmacodynamics pathways of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, and correlatespecific variants with disease outcome in breast cancer patients from the Malwaregion of Punjab.METHODS: A total of 250 confirmed breast cancer patients were involved in thestudy. Genotyping was performed on an Illumina Infinium HD assay platform using aGlobal Screening Array (GSA) microchip. GenomeStudio (Illumina, Inc.) was usedfor data preprocessing and a p value less than or equal to 5 × 10-8 wasconsidered statistically significant. To rule out the influence of confoundingrisk factors, a step-wise multivariate regression analysis was carried out toevaluate the association of genotype with overall clinical outcome.RESULTS: Two gene variants, CYP2C19 (G681A) and ALDH1A1*2 (17 bp deletion), were found to be significantly associated with the disease outcome, including overall survival, recurrence and metastasis, in breast cancer patients on adjuvanttherapy. Both these genes are involved in the pharmacokinetics ofcyclophosphamide. However, none of the variants in the genes involved inpharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of doxorubicin were found to have anysignificant impact on disease outcome in the studied group.CONCLUSION: CYP2C19 (G681A) variant and ALDH1A1*2 emerged as two importantbiomarkers associated with bad outcome in breast cancer patients on adjuvanttherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s00228-018-2505-6 PMID: 29938344
