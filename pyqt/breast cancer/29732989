Nationalcancer institute of the US estimates that one in eight women will be diagnosedwith breast cancer during their life time. Considering the devastating effects ofthe disease and the alarming numbers many scientists and research groups havedevoted their research to fight breast cancer. Several recommendations are to be considered as preventing measures which include living a healthy life style,regular physical activity, weight control and, smoking cessation. Early detectionof the disease by annual and regular mammography after the age of 40 isrecommended by many health care institutions. This would help the diagnosis ofthe disease at an earlier stage and the start of the treatment before it isspread to other parts of the body. Current therapy for breast cancer includessurgical ablation, radiotherapy and chemotherapy which is often associated withadverse effects and even may lead to a relapse of the disease at a later stage.In order to achieve a long lasting anticancer response with minimal adverseeffects, development of breast cancer vaccines is under investigation by manylaboratories. The immune system can be stimulated by a vaccine against breastcancer. This approach has attracted a great enthusiasm in recent years. No breastcancer vaccines have been approved for clinical use today. One breast cancervaccine (NeuVax) has now completed clinical trial phase III and a few preventive and therapeutic breast cancer vaccines are at different steps of development. We think that with the recent advancements in immunotherapy a breast cancer vaccine is not far from reach.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1570163815666180502164652 PMID: 29732989
