We evaluated potential determinants of awarenessabout and participation in breast and cervical cancer screening, and breastself-examination (BSE) in women using survey data from Indonesia.METHODS: From the fifth Indonesian Family Life Survey (2014-2015), a total of5397 women aged 40 and older without any history of cancer who responded toquestionnaires concerning Pap smears, mammography, and BSE were included.Multilevel modelling was used to assess potential determinants in relation toawareness about Pap smears and mammography, and participation in Pap smears andBSE practice. Multivariable analyses were performed to identify independentpredictors of cancer screening.RESULTS: Of the 5397 respondents, 1058 (20%) women were aware of Pap smears, ofwhich 297 had never had the procedure. Only 251 (5%) participants were aware ofmammography. A total of 605 (12%) of women reported they performed BSE. Highereducation and household expenditure were consistently associated with higher oddsof awareness about Pap smears and mammography (e.g. odds ratio [OR] of beingaware of Pap smear and mammography: 7.82 (95% CI: 6.30-9.70) and 7.70(6.19-9.58), respectively, for high school graduates compared to women with less educational attainment in the multivariable models), and participation in Papsmears and BSE. We also identified enabling factors linked with greater cancerscreening awareness and participation, including health insurance, shorterdistance to health services, and social participation.CONCLUSION: There are socioeconomic disparities in cancer screening awareness andparticipation among Indonesian women. Our findings may help inform targetedhealth promotion and screening for cancer in the presence of limited resources.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4125-z PMCID: PMC5838961PMID: 29506486
