Of these, BRCA germline mutations and BRCApromoter methylation are thought to be mutually exclusive, which could beexploited in clinical practice. However, this paradigm has not been studiedextensively and systematically.OBJECTIVE: To systematically investigate to what extent BRCA promoter methylationhas been reported in breast and ovarian carcinomas of BRCA germline mutationcarriers.METHODS: A comprehensive search on BRCA promoter methylation was performed inPubMed and Embase databases. Two authors independently selected studies, assessedstudy quality and extracted data according to PRISMA and QUADAS-2 guidelines.RESULTS: 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. BRCA1 methylation was found inat least 10/276 (3,6%) breast and 2/174 (1,1%) ovarian carcinomas of BRCAgermline mutation carriers, and BRCA2 methylation was found in at least 7/131(5.3%) breast and 0/51 (0.0%) ovarian carcinomas of BRCA germline mutationcarriers. Methylation frequencies varied between individual CpG sites. Theselected studies showed important differences in methodology and performed ingeneral a limited methylation and incomplete mutation analysis.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA methylation is rare in breast and ovarian carcinomas of BRCAgermline mutation carriers, although the frequency of BRCA promoter methylationmay be underestimated. This could have major implications for clinical practice, including referral for genetic testing and BRCAness analysis for treatmentdecision-making.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
