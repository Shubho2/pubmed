Electronic address:kruzliakp@vfu.cz.The breast cancer affects women with high mortality and morbidity worldwide. The risk is highest in the most developed world but also is markedly rising in thedeveloping countries. It is well documented that melatonin has a significantanti-tumor activities demonstrated on various cancer types in a plethora ofpreclinical studies. In breast cancer, melatonin is capable to disruptestrogen-dependent cell signaling, resulting in a reduction ofestrogen-stimulated cells, moreover, it's obvious neuro-immunomodulatory effectin organism was described. Several prospective studies have demonstrated theinverse correlation between melatonin metabolites and the risk of breast cancer. This correlation was confirmed by observational studies that found lowermelatonin levels in breast cancer patients. Moreover, clinical studies haveshowed that circadian disruption of melatonin synthesis, specifically night shiftwork, is linked to increased breast cancer risk. In this regard, properlight/dark exposure with more selective use of light at night along with oralsupplementation of melatonin may have benefits for high-risk women. The resultsof current preclinical studies, the mechanism of action, and clinical efficacy ofmelatonin in breast cancer are reviewed in this paper. Melatonin alone or incombined administration seems to be appropriate drug for the treatment of earlystages of breast cancer with documented low toxicity over a wide range of doses. These and other issues are also discussed.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2017.12.018 PMID: 29458781  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
