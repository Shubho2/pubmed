Data on cancer deaths were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics NationalVital Statistics System. Trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates forall cancers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex, race, and ethnicitywere estimated by joinpoint analysis and expressed as the annual percent change. Stage distribution and 5-year survival by stage at diagnosis were calculated for breast cancer, colon and rectum (colorectal) cancer, lung and bronchus cancer,and melanoma of the skin.RESULTS: Overall cancer incidence rates from 2008 to 2014 decreased by 2.2% peryear among men but were stable among women. Overall cancer death rates from 1999 to 2015 decreased by 1.8% per year among men and by 1.4% per year among women.Among men, incidence rates during the most recent 5-year period (2010-2014)decreased for 7 of the 17 most common cancer types, and death rates (2011-2015)decreased for 11 of the 18 most common types. Among women, incidence ratesdeclined for 7 of the 18 most common cancers, and death rates declined for 14 of the 20 most common cancers. Death rates decreased for cancer sites, includinglung and bronchus (men and women), colorectal (men and women), female breast, andprostate. Death rates increased for cancers of the liver (men and women);pancreas (men and women); brain and other nervous system (men and women); oralcavity and pharynx (men only); soft tissue, including heart (men only);nonmelanoma skin (men only); and uterus. Incidence and death rates were higheramong men than among women for all racial and ethnic groups. For all cancer sitescombined, black men and white women had the highest incidence rates compared withother racial groups, and black men and black women had the highest death ratescompared with other racial groups. Non-Hispanic men and women had higherincidence and mortality rates than those of Hispanic ethnicity. Five-yearsurvival for cases diagnosed from 2007 through 2013 ranged from 100% (stage I) to26.5% (stage IV) for female breast cancer, from 88.1% (stage I) to 12.6% (stageIV) for colorectal cancer, from 55.1% (stage I) to 4.2% (stage IV) for lung andbronchus cancer, and from 99.5% (stage I) to 16% (stage IV) for melanoma of theskin. Among children, overall cancer incidence rates increased by 0.8% per yearfrom 2010 to 2014, and overall cancer death rates decreased by 1.5% per year from2011 to 2015.CONCLUSIONS: For all cancer sites combined, cancer incidence rates decreasedamong men but were stable among women. Overall, there continue to be significant declines in cancer death rates among both men and women. Differences in rates andtrends by race and ethnic group remain. Progress in reducing cancer mortality hasnot occurred for all sites. Examining stage distribution and 5-year survival bystage highlights the potential benefits associated with early detection andtreatment.
