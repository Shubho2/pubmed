Increasing evidences implycircRNAs are important regulators in tumor progression. Nevertheless, howcircRNAs participate in breast cancer development and progression is not wellunderstood. In the present study, we identified a novel circRNA hsa_circ_0008039 with upregulated expression level in breast cancer tissues. By functionalexperiments, we found that hsa_circ_0008039 depletion significantly suppressedthe proliferation, arrested cell-cycle progression and reduced migration inbreast cancer. Mechanistic investigations suggested that hsa_circ_0008039 served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-432-5p. Subsequently, E2F3 wasidentified as the functional target of miR-432-5p and overexpression ofhsa_circ_0008039 elevated E2F3 expression in breast cancer. On the whole, ourstudy indicated that hsa_circ_0008039 exerted oncogenic roles in breast cancerand suggested the hsa_circ_0008039/miR-432-5p/E2F3 axis might be a potentialtherapeutic target.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
