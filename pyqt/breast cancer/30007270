The goal of thisinvestigation was to evaluate trends and practice patterns of adjuvant CT use in Luminal A pT1-3N1 breast cancer, along with determining the clinical benefit fromadjuvant CT in this patient population.METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was queried (2004-2014) for women withpT1-3N1 luminal A invasive ductal carcinoma receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy(HT). Multivariable logistic regression ascertained factors associated withadjuvant CT administration. Kaplan-Meier analysis evaluated overall survival (OS)between patients treated with CT/HT vs. HT alone, while sub-stratifying patients by age.RESULTS: Of 8548 total patients, 5182 (61%) received CT/HT, while 3366 (39%)received HT alone. A steady rise in omission of adjuvant CT was observed, from14% (2004-2005) to 41% (2012-2014). A decision not to use CT was more likely inmore recent time periods, in older patients, at academic centers, followinglumpectomy, and with lower T classification (p < 0.05 for all). CT was associatedwith higher OS in all patients (p < 0.001) and women ≤50 years old (p = 0.030),but not for ages 51-60 (p = 0.116), 61-70 (p = 0.222), or >70 (p = 0.239).CONCLUSIONS: Using CT for Luminal A N1 breast cancer is decreasing over time,primarily in older patients and at academic centers. Although CT is stillassociated with an OS advantage in all patients, subgroup analysis demonstratedno OS benefit in women >50 years of age. These results have implications on theongoing randomized trials.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.breast.2018.06.014 PMID: 30007270
