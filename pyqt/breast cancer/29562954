Recently, longnoncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed as critical regulators in biological processes, including tumorigenesis. FOXC2-AS1, a single antisense oligonucleotideRNA transcribed from the negative strand of Forkhead box protein C2 (FOXC2), has been identified as oncogene in osteosarcoma. In the present study, weinvestigated the prognosis value and biological role of FOXC2-AS1 in breastcancer (BC). Our findings revealed that FOXC2-AS1 was significantly increased in BC tissues and cell lines, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that highlevel of FOXC2-AS1 was associated with poor prognosis of BC patients.Loss-of-function revealed thatsilenced FOXC2-AS1 significantly suppressed theproliferation ability and flow cytometric analysis illustrated the influence ofFOXC2-AS1 on cell cycle and apoptosis rate. Finally, we found Cyclin D1 CyclinD2, and Cyclin D3 were all partly positively modulated by FOXC2-AS1 in BC.Collectively, FOXC2-AS1 may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker andtherapeutic target for BC patients.DOI: 10.3727/096504018X15213126075068 PMID: 29562954
