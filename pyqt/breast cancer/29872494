To investigate thispossibility, we conducted a retro-spective of 173 small-cell lung cancerpatients. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that pretreatment overweight (BM I ≥ 23) was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) (Hazardratio, = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.39-0.87, p = 0.008). In addition, meta-regressionrevealed that per-formance status (≤ 2) marginally interacted with increased BMI (p = 0.068). However, subgroup analysis showed that patients with a BMI ≥ 23 and performance status ≤ 2 had the best OS (Hazard ratio: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.16-0.61, p = 0.001). Premorbid BMI and performance status level are easy to measure and may provide physicians an additional measurement to predict a small-cell lung cancer patient's survival. The data from the present study indicates that a, furtherlarge scale prospective study is warranted to better assess the association ofpretreatment BMI and OS in small-cell lung cancer. .DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24935 PMCID: PMC5973860PMID: 29872494
