The blisters had ruptured spontaneously and healed with scarring. Hedenied antecedent trauma. His medical history was remarkable forinsulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,primary cutaneous melanoma status-post excision, and breast cancer status-postmastectomy and chemotherapy. Physical examination revealed nontender bullae,measuring up to 4 cm × 3 cm and containing serous fluid, on the anterior portion of both tibias (Figure 1). The Nikolsky sign was negative. There was no evidence of surrounding inflammation. A biopsy revealed subepidermal bullae formation withsparse inflammatory infiltrate (Figure 2). Direct and indirect immunofluorescencestudies were negative for immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, IgM, complement C3, C5b-9, and fibrinogen deposition. Culture of the bullous fluid was negative.PMID: 29551123
