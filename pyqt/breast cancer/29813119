However, an ideal triple-negativebreast cancer (TNBC) mouse model is lacking. What has been missing in the TNBCmouse model is a sequential progression of the disease in an essential nativemicroenvironment. This notion inspired us to develop a TNBC-model in syngeneicmice using a mammary intraductal (MIND) method. To achieve this goal, Mvt-1and4T1 TNBC mouse cell lines were injected into the mammary ducts via nipples ofFVB/N mice and BALB/c wild-type immunocompetent mice, respectively. Weestablished that the TNBC-MIND model in syngeneic mice could epitomize all breastcancer progression stages and metastasis into the lungs via lymphatic orhematogenous dissemination within four weeks. Collectively, the syngeneicmouse-TNBC-MIND model may serve as a unique platform for further investigation ofthe underlying mechanisms of TNBC growth and therapies.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198143 PMCID: PMC5973560PMID: 29813119
