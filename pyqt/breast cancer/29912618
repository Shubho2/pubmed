Previously, we have shown that caloric restriction (CR) can augment the effects of radiation therapy in a TNBC mouse model. To buildupon this, we now present data regarding the combination of chemotherapy and CRin the same 4T1 model. Chemotherapy can induce inflammation that breedsresistance to therapy. We propose CR as a mechanism to decreasechemotherapy-induced inflammation and increase efficacy of therapy. 12-week oldBalb/c mice were orthotopically injected with a syngeneic triple negative breast cancer cell line (4T1) and were treated in one of six cohorts: ad lib fed (AL),30% reduction in calorie intake (CR), cisplatin or docetaxol alone or acombination CR+cisplatin/docetaxol. Mice in the cohorts receiving chemotherapy+CRhad longer overall survival (12 ± 2 days) as compared to the AL group. These micealso demonstrated less lung metastases at the final time point of in vivoimaging. In addition, downregulation of the IGF-1R and IRS signaling pathwayswere noted most significantly in those mice receiving combination therapy.Lastly, serum from these mice demonstrated an increase in inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β in response to chemotherapy alone. This increase was dampened by the addition of CR. Taken together, these data suggest that while chemotherapy iseffective in TNBC, it can cause inflammation, which can be a driver of resistanceto therapy. This chemotherapy-induced inflammation can be reversed with the useof CR as a nontoxic adjunct to treatment.DOI: 10.1080/15384101.2018.1471314 PMID: 29912618
