Therefore, the identification ofspecific biomarkers and potential therapeutic target molecules for hematogenousrecurrence is required to improve the outcomes of these patients. Here,transcriptome and bioinformatics analyses were conducted to uncover candidatemolecules differentially expressed in patients with hematogenous recurrence ofgastric cancer. One potential candidate identified was asialoglycoproteinreceptor 2 (ASGR2), and siRNA experiments were conducted to determine the effect of manipulating ASGR2 expression has on cell phenotypes. ASGR2 mRNA expressionanalysis using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR was conductedwith stage II/III gastric cancer clinical specimens (n = 95). Transcript levelswere increased in gastric cancer cells as compared with a control nontumorigenic epithelial cell line. Knockdown of ASGR2 decreased the adhesion and migrationpotential. Thus, although gastric cancer cell-invasive activity was significantlydecreased by knockdown, forced expression of ASGR2 promoted invasive activity.Using a mouse hepatic metastasis model, knockdown of ASGR2 resulted in theabsence of hepatic metastasis formation. High ASGR2 expression in primary gastriccancer tissues was an independent predictor of shorter disease-free and overallsurvival. Finally, patients with high ASGR2 expression were more likely to have ahigh cumulative rate of hematogenous recurrence but not peritoneal or nodalrecurrence.Implications:ASGR2 expression is associated with the malignantphenotypes in gastric cancer and represents a specific biomarker of hematogenous recurrences after curative resection for gastric cancer.
