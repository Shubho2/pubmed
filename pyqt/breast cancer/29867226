More recently, studies have also identifiedBRCA1/2 status as clinically relevant in the selection of therapy for patientsalready diagnosed with breast cancer. Emerging breast and ovarian cancer researchindicate that BRCA status predicts responsiveness to platinum-based chemotherapy,as well as to inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), owing to theability of these interventions to inhibit DNA repair pathways. BRCA1/2 mutationtesting thus has important and expanding roles in treatment planning for subsets of patients with breast cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated differentactivity of platinum salts in BRCA-mutated compared with non-BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Furthermore, phase II/III studies of single-agent PARP inhibitors (PARPi)have shown encouraging progression-free survival results in patients withBRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer, which led to the recent approval of olaparib, the first PARPi to be approved in breast cancer. Determining BRCA1/2 mutation status in this breast cancer subgroup could potentially expand treatment options beyond the current standard of taxane and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Althoughattempts have been made to develop scoring systems that measure defects inhomologous recombination repair pathways to predict response to platinum orPARPi, none have yet made it into clinical use. In this review, we summarise the recent and ongoing preclinical and clinical studies on the treatment ofBRCA-associated breast cancer, and discuss efforts to identify other breastcancer patients who may be responsive to therapies effective in BRCA mutationcarriers, including platinum-containing chemotherapy and PARPi.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0127-5 PMID: 29867226
