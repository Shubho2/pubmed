Group interventions showed benefits to emotional distress andfatigue, but most of these studies focus on breast cancer patients. However, itis important to test if an effective intervention for breast cancer patientscould also have benefits for prostate cancer patients.METHODS: Our controlled study aimed to compare the efficacy of aself-hypnosis/self-care group intervention to improve emotional distress, sleepdifficulties, fatigue and quality of life of breast and prostate cancer patients.25 men with prostate cancer and 68 women with breast cancer participated and wereevaluated before (T0) and after (T1) the intervention.RESULTS: After the intervention, the breast cancer group showed positive effects for anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep difficulties, and global health status,whereas there was no effect in the prostate cancer group. We showed that womensuffered from higher difficulties prior to the intervention and that theironcological treatments were different in comparison to men.CONCLUSION: The differences in the efficacy of the intervention could beexplained by the baseline differences. As men in our sample reported fewdistress, fatigue or sleep problems, it is likely that they did not improve onthese dimensions.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02569294 and NCT03423927 ).Retrospectively registered in October 2015 and February 2018 respectively.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4607-z PMCID: PMC6013950PMID: 29929493
