The anticancer activity of the complexes was tested against humanbreast (MCF-7), lung (A549), colon (HCT116), and prostate (DU145) cancer celllines as well as against normal bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells.Trans-configured complexes 1, 3 and 5 emerged as potential anticancer drugcandidates. The mechanism of action of the potent complexes was then investigatedin detail. The three complexes interacted with DNA by groove binding and with HSAvia hydrophobic IIA subdomain. Furthermore, the complexes cleaved plasmid DNAefficiently. Cellular uptake studies in MCF-7 cells showed that the biologically active complexes were mainly localized in cytoplasm. The cytotoxic activity was afunction of the lipophilicity and cellular accumulation of the complexes. Asdetermined by M30, Annexin V and Caspase 3/7 activity assays, the complexesinduced apoptosis in MCF-7 and HCT116 cells. Mechanistic studies showed that the potent complexes cause excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and display a dual action, concurrently targeting both mitochondria and genomic DNA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
