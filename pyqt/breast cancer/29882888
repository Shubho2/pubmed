Nanomaterials showpromising results in treating cancer cells and have many advantages such as high biocompatibility, bioavailability and effective therapeutic capabilities.Interestingly, fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles have been used in manybiological and diagnostic applications, but there is no report of use offluorescent magnetic submicronic polymer nanoparticles (FMSP-nanoparticles) inthe treatment of human breast cancer cells. In the present study, we tested theeffect of FMSP-nanoparticles on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). We testeddifferent concentrations (1.25, 12.5 and 50 &micro;g/mL) of FMSP-nanoparticles inMCF-7 cells and evaluated the nanoparticles response morphometrically. Ourresults revealed that FMSP-nanoparticles produced a concentration dependenteffect on the cancer cells, a dose of 1.25 &micro;g/mL produced no significanteffect on the cancer cell morphology and cell death, whereas dosages of 12.5 and 50 &micro;g/mL resulted in significant nuclear augmentation, disintegration,chromatic condensation followed by dose dependent cell death. Our resultsdemonstrate that FMSP-nanoparticles induce cell death in MCF-7 cells and may be apotential anti-cancer agent for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.3390/biom8020032 PMCID: PMC6022976PMID: 29882888
