China.microRNAs (miRs) are targets for genomic aberrations and emerging treatmentsagainst cancer. It has been demonstrated that targeting miR-569 may potentiallybenefit patients with ovarian or breast cancer. However, the exact roles ofmiR-569 remain unclear in human lung cancer cells. Using the reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), it wasdemonstrated that miR-569 expression was consistently decreased in lung cancercells. As well as cell proliferation and migration inhibition, apoptosis and cellarrest at the G1 phase were induced following reversion of miR-569 expression in lung cancer cells. The present study demonstrated that miR-569 was able todownregulate FOS and high mobility group A2 mRNA and protein expression usingRT-qPCR and western blot analysis. The observed role of miRNA-569 in lung cancer cells in the present study suggested that it may be a novel and promisingtherapeutic target, and a novel biomarker for detecting lung cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7869 PMCID: PMC5835959PMID: 29541173
