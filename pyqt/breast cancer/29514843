The objectives of this study were tocomprehensively review the literature on AR prognostication and determine optimalcriteria for AR as an independent predictor of breast cancersurvival.Experimental Design: AR positivity was assessed by immunostaining in twoclinically validated primary breast cancer cohorts [training cohort, n = 219;validation cohort, n = 418; 77% and 79% estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) positive,respectively]. The optimal AR cut-point was determined by ROC analysis in thetraining cohort and applied to both cohorts.Results: AR was an independentprognostic marker of breast cancer outcome in 22 of 46 (48%) previous studiesthat performed multivariate analyses. Most studies used cut-points of 1% or 10%nuclear positivity. Herein, neither 1% nor 10% cut-points were robustlyprognostic. ROC analysis revealed that a higher AR cut-point (78% positivity)provided optimal sensitivity and specificity to predict breast cancer survival inthe training (HR, 0.41; P = 0.015) and validation (HR, 0.50; P = 0.014) cohorts. Tenfold cross-validation confirmed the robustness of this AR cut-point. Patients with ERα-positive tumors and AR positivity ≥78% had the best survival in bothcohorts (P < 0.0001). Among the combined ERα-positive cases, those withcomparable or higher levels of AR (AR:ERα-positivity ratio >0.87) had the bestoutcomes (P < 0.0001).Conclusions: This study defines an optimal AR cut-point to reliably predict breast cancer survival. Testing this cut-point in prospectivecohorts is warranted for implementation of AR as a prognostic factor in theclinical management of breast cancer.
