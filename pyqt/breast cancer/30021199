Aberrant microRNA expression is associated with the dysfunctionof self-renewal and proliferation in cancer stem cells, while there is littleinformation about the TNBC-specific microRNAs in regulating CSC ability.METHODS: Solexa deep sequencing was performed to detect the expression levels of TNBC or non-TNBC stem cells (CSCs) microRNAs. Mammosphere formation assay,qRT-PCR and the xenograft model in nude mice were performed. Bioinformaticanalysis and microarray were used to select the target gene, and luciferasereporter assays were used to confirm the binding sites.RESULTS: Solexa sequencing data exhibited differential expression of 193microRNAs between TNBC and non-TNBC stem cells. The gene ontology analysis andpathways analyses showed that genes were involved in the maintenance of stemness.MiR-4319 could suppress the self-renewal and formation of tumorspheres in TNBCCSCs through E2F2, and also inhibited tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo.Moreover, increased E2F2 could reverse the effect of miR-4319 on the self-renewalin TNBC CSCs.CONCLUSIONS: MiR-4319 suppresses the malignancy of TNBC by regulatingself-renewal and tumorigenesis of stem cells and might be a remarkable prognosticfactor or therapeutic target for patients with TNBC.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
