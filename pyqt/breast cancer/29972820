However, the role of AP-2β, a keymember of AP-2 family, in breast cancer is rarely reported.METHODS: The effect of AP-2 on cell growth, migration and invasion in breastcancer cells were measured by MTT, colony formation, wound-healing and transwell assays, respectively. The expression levels of AP-2β and other specific markersin breast cancer cell lines and tissue microarrays from the patients weredetected using RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemical staining. Theregulation of AP-2β on tumor growth in vivo was analyzed in a mouse xenograftmodel.RESULTS: We demonstrated the tumor-promoting function of AP-2β in breast cancer. AP-2β was found to be highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines and tumortissues of breast cancer patients. The shRNA-mediated silencing of AP-2β led tothe dramatic inhibition of cell proliferation, colony formation ability,migration and invasiveness in breast cancer cells accompanied by thedown-regulated expression of some key proteins involved in cancer progression,including p75, MMP-2, MMP-9, C-Jun, p-ERK and STAT3. Overexpression of AP-2βmarkedly up-regulated the levels of these proteins. Consistent with the in vitro study, the silencing or overexpression of AP-2β blocked or promoted tumor growth in the mice with xenografts of breast cancers. Notably, the high AP-2β expressionlevels was correlated with poor prognosis and advanced malignancy in patientswith breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that AP-2β promotes tumor growth and predictspoor prognosis, and may represent a potential therapeutic target for breastcancer.© 2018 The Author(s).
