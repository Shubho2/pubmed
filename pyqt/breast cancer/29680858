These modifications are a subset of epigenetic alterations which affect tumorigenesis and progression through changesin gene expression and cell growth. Results of histone modification studiesprompted us to explore the therapeutic and prognostic significance of histonedeacetylase 3 (HDAC3) expression in patients with breast cancer. MATERIAL ANDMETHODS Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used to detect HDAC3 expression ina tissue microarray (TMA) that included 145 patients diagnosed with invasiveductal breast carcinoma. IHC scoring was used to evaluate the staining intensity and the proportion of positive cells. RESULTS HDAC3 expression was significantly correlated with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative expression (P=0.036) andprogesterone receptor (PR)-negative expression (P=0.024). Additionally, HDAC3expression was significantly positively correlated with human epidermal growthfactor 2 (HER2) overexpression (P=0.037). Our study also indicated that highexpression of HDAC3 was more frequently observed in breast tumors with PT2classification (74%) versus PT1 (50.0%) and PT3 (71.4%) (P=0.040). Furthermore,HDAC3 was correlated with clinical stage II (P=0.046). Univariate andmultivariate survival analyses showed that high expression of HDAC3 wascorrelated with poor overall survival (OS) (P=0.029 and P=0.033, respectively) inpatients without lymph node involvement. CONCLUSIONS High HDAC3 expression isclosely correlated with ER-negative expression, PR-negative expression, HER2overexpression, PT stage, and clinical stage of breast tumors. HDAC3 may be anappropriate prognostic indicator in patients with invasive ductal breast cancer.PMCID: PMC5935015PMID: 29680858
