It is one of the noteworthy problems in cancer therapy. Asone of the most important drugs in cancer therapy, doxorubicin has not goodeffectiveness if used independently. So targeting the P-gp protein is one of the key points to solve the MDR. Three series of furan derivatives containingtetrahydroquinoline or tetrahydroisoquinoline were designed and synthesized asP-gp inhibitors in this paper. Compound 5m containing6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline possessed good potency against P-gp (EC50 = 0.89 ± 0.11 μM). The preliminary structure-activity relationship anddocking studies demonstrated that compound 5m would be great promise as a leadcompound for further study. Most worthy of mention is drug combination ofdoxorubicin and 5m displayed antiproliferative effect of about 97.8%. This study provides highlighted P-gp inhibitor for withstanding malignant tumor cell withmultidrug resistance especially doxorubicin resistance setting the basis forfurther studies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
