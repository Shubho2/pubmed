The aims are to compare the QL scores of these patients after follow-up with their scores before the start of radiotherapy (RT) andcompare QL among different axillary treatment groups.METHODS: Of 173 patients over 65 who began treatment and completed the EORTCQLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 and the Interview for Deterioration in Daily LivingActivities in Dementia (IDDD) before RT, 138 also completed these questionnaires three years after RT. Longitudinal changes in QL were assessed for the wholesample using linear mixed-effect models. Also assessed were differences in QLscores between axillary treatment groups (axillary node dissection ALND, sentinellymph node biopsy SLNB, and no surgery) at the end of the follow-up (Anova orKruskal-Wallis) and differences in the evolution of QL from baseline among these groups (linear regression models).RESULTS: QL scores in the follow-up were high (>70/100 points) in most QL areas, with moderate limitations (>30) in sexual functioning and enjoyment. Five areas(pain, nausea/vomiting, financial impact, breast symptoms and IDDD) improvedsignificantly (<6 points) in the follow-up. The ALND group scored less for thefuture perspective item (15-20 points) in the follow-up than the other twoaxillary treatment groups. No differences between the pre-treatment and follow upassessments regarding treatment were found among the axillary treatment groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that early-stage breast cancer patients adapted well both to their disease and treatments over the follow-up period and to theadministration of RT. There were few QL differences between the axillarytreatment groups.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.breast.2018.06.010 PMID: 30007271
