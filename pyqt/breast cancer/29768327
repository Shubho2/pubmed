Therefore, we aimed to clarify thesurvival benefit of NAC versus postoperative chemotherapy by conducting anupdated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).METHODS: The authors searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Web ofScience, Chinese biomedical literature database, and Chinese Scientific Journals full-text database from their inception to December 2016. The authors identified relevant RCTs that compared NAC with postoperative chemotherapy in the treatment of operable breast cancer. The main endpoints were overall survival (OS) andrecurrence-free survival (RFS).RESULTS: A total of 21 citations representing 16 unique studies were eligible.There were 787 deaths among 2794 patients assigned to NAC groups and 816 deathsamong 2799 patients assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy groups. A meta-analysis of data indicated that there was no significant benefit in terms of OS ([hazardratio [HR] = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94-1.13, P = .51) and RFS(HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.93-1.10, P = .80) between the NAC and postoperativechemotherapy groups. The pooled HR estimate for OS was not influenced by NACcycles, the total number of chemotherapy cycles, administration of tamoxifen,administration of adjuvant chemotherapy, or type of NAC regimen. Subgroupanalysis showed that the pooled HR estimate for RFS was influenced byanthracycline-containing regimens. Patients with a pathological complete responsehad superior survival outcomes compared with patients who had residual disease.CONCLUSION: The survival benefits for patients with operable breast cancer whoreceived either NAC or adjuvant chemotherapy based on anthracycline regimens werecomparable.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010634 PMCID: PMC5976345PMID: 29768327  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
