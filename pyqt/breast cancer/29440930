Its mechanism of action is through microtubule inhibition, whichis different from that of taxanes. Eribulin has been approved for the treatmentof metastatic breast cancer and more recently for non-operable or metastaticliposarcoma in patients who have received prior anthracycline chemotherapy. Themajor side effects of eribulin are bone marrow suppression including neutropenia,leukopenia, anemia, and fatigue/weakness, which can be well managed. In thisarticle, we reviewed evidence from the latest published data on eribulin and its use in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. We explored the drug's mechanism ofaction, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism. Lastly, we reviewedall preclinical studies as well as clinical trials that investigated eribulin.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S143019 PMCID: PMC5798537PMID: 29440930
