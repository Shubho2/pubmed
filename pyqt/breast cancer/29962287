It is shown in recent studies that progesterone-induced blocking factoris overexpressed in many malignant tumors such as breast, cervical, lymphoma, andleukemia. There are no data about progesterone-induced blocking factor expressionin ovarian cancer cells. Hence, it is aimed to determine the progesterone-inducedblocking factor expression levels in epithelial ovarian cancer.METHODS: The study which was a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in a University Hospital. Twenty tissue specimens of patients with epithelialovarian cancer and 20 tissue specimens of patients with healthy ovary wereincluded in the study. Primary rabbit polyclonal anti- progesterone-inducedblocking factor antibody was used to incubate the sections at a ratio of 1:300.RESULTS: When the tissue sections were compared based on immunostaining withprogesterone-induced blocking factor, we detected high stromalprogesterone-induced blocking factor expression in the epithelial ovarian cancer group as check against to the normal ovarian group ( P = .007). Similarly, wefound high glandular progesterone-induced blocking factor expression in theepithelial ovarian cancer group as check against to the normal ovarian group ( P < .001).CONCLUSION: Proving the existence of progesterone-induced blocking factorexpression in epithelial ovarian cancer cells may lead new visions or new studiesfor epithelial ovarian cancer immunotherapy. As a result, epithelial ovariancancer cells have greater levels of expression of progesterone-induced blockingfactor protein than normal ovarian tissue according to immunohistochemistry.Further research is needed to understand the clinical importance of this finding,to learn outcomes of high levels of progesterone-induced blocking factor, and to investigate its underlying mechanisms.DOI: 10.1177/1533033818783911 PMCID: PMC6048602PMID: 29962287
