The inhibitor of miR-449a was synthesized by chemical and detected by real-time PCR aftertransfection aimed to verify the expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assaywas used to detect the ability of cell proliferation after transfection withmiR-449a inhibitor. Scratch assay was used to detect cell migration of MCF-7, andcell invasion ability was showed by transwell assay; The MCF-7 cell proliferationand migration related proteins, β-catenin and E-cadherin, were detected byWestern blot. The potential target gene of miR-449a was predicted bybioinformatics software, and Notch homolog 1 (Notch 1) was proved to be thetarget gene of miR-449a by luciferase assay.RESULTS: MCF-7 and MCF-10a cells were collected separately, and miRNA chipresults showed that the level of miR-449a in MCF-7 cells was significantly higherthan that of MCF-10A. In this study, the cells were divided into mock group,negative control group (NC group) and treatment group, the MCF-7 cells werecollected before and after treatment and CCK-8 results showed that knockdown ofmiR-449a decreased MCF-7 cell proliferation ability significantly. Scratch assay results showed that downregulated miR-449a was related to the decreasedmetastasis of MCF-7 cells. Transwell results showed that knockdown of miR-449ainhibited the invasion of MCF-7 cells. Western blot showed the expression ofβ-catenin was decreased and the expression of E-cadherin was increased afterknockdown of miR-449a. Luciferase assay showed that miR-449a could significantly decrease the luciferase activity of Notch homolog 1-untranslated region (Notch1-3'-UTR) plasmid (P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of miR-449a in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 cansignificantly inhibit the proliferation and migration of cancer cells, which may be achieved by decreasing the expression of Notch 1 protein.DOI: 10.12047/j.cjap.5601.2017.121 PMID: 29931899
