Variables assessed for prognostic correlations included age ≥ 66, sex, Karnofsky PS score, primary tumorsite, baseline CA19.9 level ≥ 59xULN, 12-week decrease of the CA19.9 level ≥ 50% from baseline, basal bilirubin level, baseline NLR, biliary stent implantation,and liver metastasis. Survival analyses were generated according to theKaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by a Coxproportional hazard model.Results: According to NLR values, the patients were divided into two groups: highand low. Low group patients showed a better median PFS (7 months versus 5 months)and median OS (13 months versus 7 months) in respect to high group patients. Atmultivariate analysis, Karnofsky PS < 80% (HR = 0.4; CI 0.2-1.2), livermetastases (HR = 0.4; CI 0.18-0.82), and NLR ≥ 5 (HR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.4-5.2) were predictors of poorer OS. Based on the presence of one or more independentprognostic factors, three risk categories were identified: good-risk,intermediate-risk and poor-risk. The median OS was 22, 10, and 7 months,respectively.Conclusions: Baseline NLR is an independent predictor of survival of patientswith mPC receiving palliative chemotherapy and could be useful to develop asimple clinical score to identify a subgroup of patients with a low chance tobenefit from chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1155/2018/2373868 PMCID: PMC6015665PMID: 29983708
