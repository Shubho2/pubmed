Migratory breast cancer cells in lymphatic and blood vessels seek newsites and form metastatic colonies in the lung and bone, and then these cancercells often wreak considerable havoc. With advances in nanotechnology,nanomaterials and nanotechnologies are widely applied in tumor therapy. In thispaper, small size fullerenol nanoparticles, which are separated by isoelectricfocusing electrophoresis (IFE) for discrepancy of isoelectric point (pI), areused in the study of tumor metastasis.RESULTS: In this study, the commendable inhibition of tumor metastasis wasuncovered by intravenous injection of purified fullerenol fraction with specialsurface charge and functional groups, which was separated by IFE for discrepancy of pI. By investigating the actin dynamics in several cancer cell lines, we foundthese small size fullerenol nanoparticles disturbed actin dynamics. Young'smodulus detection and cell migration assays revealed that fullerenol loweredstiffness and restrained migration of breast cancer cells. Filopodia, the mainsupporting structures of actin bundles, are important for cell motility andadhesion. Scanning electron microscopy showed that fullerenol reduced the number and length of filopodia. Simultaneously, the inhibition of integrin to formclusters on filopodias, which was likely induced by reorganizing of actincytoskeleton, impacted cancer cell adhesion and motility.CONCLUSIONS: With intravenous injection of these fullerenol nanoparticles, tumor metastasis is well inhibited in vivo. The underlying mechanism most likely to be attributed to the effect of fullerenol nanoparticles on disturbing actindynamics. With the disordered actin fiber, cell function is varied, includingdecreased cell stiffness, reduced filopodia formation, and inactivated integrin.DOI: 10.1186/s12951-018-0380-z PMCID: PMC6015447PMID: 29935539
