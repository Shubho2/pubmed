Associations betweenthrombocytosis and cancer outcomes have been made mostly from single-time-pointstudies, often at the time of diagnosis. Using laboratory data from theDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA), we examined the potential benefits of using longitudinal platelet counts in improving patient prognosis predictions. Tenfeatures (summary statistics and engineered features) were derived to describethe platelet counts of 10,000+ VA lung, prostate, and colon cancer patients andincorporated into an age-adjusted LASSO regression analysis to determine feature importance, and predict overall or relapse-free survival, which was compared tothe previously used approach of monitoring for thrombocytosis near diagnosis(Postdiag AG400 model). Temporal features describing acute platelet countincreases/decreases were found to be important in cancer survival andrelapse-survival that helped stratify good and bad outcomes of cancer patientgroups. Predictions of overall and relapse-free survival were improved by up to30% compared to the Postdiag AG400 model. Our study indicates the association of temporally derived platelet count features with a patients' prognosispredictions.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25019-1 PMCID: PMC5920102PMID: 29700384
