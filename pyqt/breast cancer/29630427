Epub2018 Apr 9.Evidence on the use of progesterone in menopausal hormone therapy.Mirkin S(1).Author information: (1)a TherapeuticsMD , Boca Raton , FL , USA.A need exists for a regulatory agency-approved hormone therapy (HT) withnaturally occurring hormones combining progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2),since no single product contains both endogenous hormones. Many women choose HTwith P4 and millions of women around the world are using unapproved, poorlyregulated compounded HT. The use of natural P4 in HT results, for the most part, in favorable outcomes without deleterious effects, as shown in clinical studiesof postmenopausal women. Importantly, P4 used in HT prevents endometrialhyperplasia from estrogens while helping relieve vasomotor symptoms and improvingquality-of-life measures. Additionally, risk of venous thromboembolism and breastcancer does not appear to increase with use of P4 plus estrogens as shown withsynthetic progestins plus estrogens in large observations studies, and nodetrimental effects of P4 in HT have been found on outcomes related tocardiovascular disease or cognition. A regulatory agency-approved HT withnaturally occurring E2/P4 could be an option for the millions of women who desirea bioidentical product and/or are exposed to potential risks of inadequatelystudied and under-regulated compounded HT.DOI: 10.1080/13697137.2018.1455657 PMID: 29630427
