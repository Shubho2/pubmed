Electronic address: Antonio.cano@uv.es.The endocrine background of breast cancer has raised questions about the increasein risk that might bear the use of hormonal contraceptives. This has been aparticular issue in the case of young women, who constitute the population ofcontraceptive consumers. Observational studies have been the main source ofevidence, which has mainly limited to the combined estrogen-progestogenpreparations, the popular pill. Studies in the 80's and 90's of the past century found a small, around a 20%, increase in risk. The translation in absolute numberof excess cases has been exiguous because the prevalence of the disease isrelatively small in premenopausal women. Moreover, the risk slowly seemed todisappear after 5-10 years of use. The more sophisticated analyses provided bynew technologies, together with the powerful central registries in somecountries, has confirmed increased risk of similar size. Recent preparations,with lower doses of estrogens and new progestogenic molecules, have notsubstantially modified the risk size. The impact of progestogen onlyalternatives, either pills or progestogen-loaded intrauterine devices, seems tobe similar, but the evidence is still insufficient. Whether there is apreferential effect on histological or molecular subtypes of breast tumours isbeing debated yet. The data on women at higher risk, either with mutations of theBRCA1/2 genes or with familial weight, have not found specific response patterns,but the experience is still meagre. It is of interest that long-term follow updata on women who enrolled in the initial cohorts, like that of the Royal Collegeof General Practitioners', have shown a considerable protection against cancer ofthe ovary (relative risk, RR 0.67), endometrium (RR 0.66), or colorectum (RR0.81).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
