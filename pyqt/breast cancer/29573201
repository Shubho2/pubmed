Epub 2018 Mar 23.Intake of bean fiber, beans, and grains and reduced risk of hormonereceptor-negative breast cancer: the San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study.Sangaramoorthy M(1), Koo J(1), John EM(1)(2).Author information: (1)Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, California, 94538.(2)Department of Health Research and Policy (Epidemiology) and Stanford CancerInstitute, Stanford University School of Medicine Stanford, Stanford, California,94305.High dietary fiber intake has been associated with reduced breast cancer risk,but few studies considered tumor subtypes defined by estrogen receptor (ER) andprogesterone receptor (PR) status or included racial/ethnic minority populations who vary in their fiber intake. We analyzed food frequency data from apopulation-based case-control study, including 2135 breast cancer cases (1070Hispanics, 493 African Americans, and 572 non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs)) and 2571controls (1391 Hispanics, 557 African Americans, and 623 NHWs). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for breast cancer associated with fiber intake were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. Breast cancer riskassociated with high intake (high vs. low quartile) of bean fiber(p-trend = 0.01), total beans (p-trend = 0.03), or total grains (p-trend = 0.05) was reduced by 20%. Inverse associations were strongest for ER-PR- breast cancer,with risk reductions associated with high intake ranging from 28 to 36%. For beanfiber, risk was reduced among foreign-born Hispanics only, who had the highestfiber intake, whereas for grain intake, inverse associations were found amongNHWs only. There was no evidence of association with fiber intake from vegetablesand fruits or total intake of vegetables and fruits. A high dietary intake ofbean fiber and fiber-rich foods such as beans and grains may lower the risk ofER-PR- breast cancer, an aggressive breast cancer subtype for which few riskfactors have been identified.© 2018 The Authors.
