Secondary analysis was usedfrom the primary data collected in 2013 from a total of 110 breast cancerpatients receiving HT for more than 3 months, using questionnaires of the Korean version of brief pain inventory and the menopause rating scale.Results: Mean age of the participants was 53.56. Most (88.2%) of the participantsreported to have pain and almost (95.5%) of them reported to have menopausesymptoms. More pain was reported in participants with aromatase inhibitor (AI)than those with tamoxifen. Adherence to HT showed a significant differenceaccording to the rate of feeling increased pain (P = 0.001). Among the menopause symptoms, fatigue was the most common symptom (97.3%). Sweating/flush wassignificantly higher in tamoxifen group (P < 0.005), and joint and musclecomplaints were higher in AI group (P < 005).Conclusions: The results of the study show that the prevalence and levels of painand menopause symptoms among breast cancer patients receiving HT were high. Thus,oncology professionals need to provide appropriate interventions to relieve pain and menopause symptom to improve adherence to HT.DOI: 10.4103/apjon.apjon_45_17 PMCID: PMC5996590PMID: 29963588
