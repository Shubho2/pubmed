The 188W/188Re generator is anideal source for the long-term (4-6 months) continuous availability of 188Resuitable for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals for different radionuclidetherapies. Labeling at HEDP, it can use cost-effective for BTRT, if enoughpatients are available for therapy. And so, 188Re-HEDP is the ideal candidate in developing countries which high population to replace the other agents. TwoGerman groups documented a response rate of 80% without any severe side effectsand similar bone marrow toxicity compared to the other compounds for 188Re-HEDP. Using 188Re-HEDP in repeated treatments, a prolonged overall survival of repeatedto single application was observed (from 4.5 months for single to 15.7 monthsusing ≥≥3 applications).DOI: 10.4103/wjnm.WJNM_85_17 PMCID: PMC6034542PMID: 30034275
