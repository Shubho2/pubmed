Electronic address: zfwang@seu.edu.cn.In this work, carbon nanosphere (CNS)-based fluorescence "turn off/on" aptasensorwas developed for targeted detection of breast cancer cell MCF-7 by conjugationwith FAM (a dye)-labeled mucin1 (MUC1) aptamer P0 (P0-FAM), which can recognizeMUC1 protein overexpressed on the surface of MCF-7. Different from other carbonbased fluorescence quenching materials, CNSs prepared by the carbonization ofglucose not only have the high fluorescence quenching efficiency (98.8%), butalso possess negligible cytotoxicity (in the concentration range of 0-1 mg/mL,which is 10 times higher than that of traditional carbon nanotubes or grapheneoxide (0-100 µg/mL)). As for the detection of the mimic of the tumor antigenMUC1, the resulting fluorescence intensity increases nearly linearly in the rangeof 0-6 μM with the limit of detection (LOD) of 25 nM.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
