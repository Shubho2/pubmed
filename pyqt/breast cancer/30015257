Median follow-up was 5.2 years (range 0.3-8.4).Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate 5-year LC. Logistic regressionidentified factors associated with receipt of CF vs HF WBI.RESULTS: Of 270 eligible women, 227 (84%) were treated with HF and 43 (16%) with CF WBI. A tumor bed boost of 10 Gy/5 fractions was given in 97% of patients, 53% received adjuvant chemotherapy and 94% (225/239) with estrogen-positive diseasereceived endocrine therapy. Median age was 45 years (range 30-49) in HF and 40years (range 19-49) in the CF group. The 5-year LC rate was 99.3% (95% CI97.9-100%, p = 0.495) in the HF and 97.5% (95% CI 92.8-100%) in the CF group. On univariate analysis, age ≤ 40 years or triple negative BC was associated with adecreased likelihood of receiving HF WBI. Only age remained significant onmultivariate analysis [OR 2.82 (95% CI 1.45-5.48, p = 0.002)].CONCLUSIONS: HF WBI was associated with excellent LC rates in this study cohort, comparable to CF WBI. However, CF WBI was more likely to be recommended to women <40 years.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.breast.2018.07.002 PMID: 30015257
