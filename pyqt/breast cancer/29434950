Through the maintenance of epithelia, CADM genes protect against malignant conversion andmetastasis. Whilst numerous in vitro studies have investigated the molecularcharacteristics of CADM1 and CADM4 and in vivo studies have investigated CADM1and CADM4 expression in a number of tumor types, the roles of CADM1 and CADM4have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, CADM1 and CADM4expression levels were evaluated using immunohistochemistry staining in 208patients with breast cancer and compared with clinicopathological factors. CADM1 and CADM4 expression levels were negative in 160 (76.9%) and 166 (79.8%) of the208 cases, respectively. The lack of expression in these cases was associatedwith advanced tumor stage, suggesting that inactivation of CADM1 and CADM4promotes breast cancer development. The prognostic role of CADM1 and CADM4 inbreast cancer was also evaluated and the expression of CADM1 and CADM4 were notassociated with cancer-specific survival or overall survival rate in the cohortof patients in the present study. Whilst these results suggested that CADM1 andCADM4 possess tumor suppressive roles, further functional experiments arerequired to address the important mechanisms involving CADM1 and CADM4.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7536 PMCID: PMC5777359PMID: 29434950
