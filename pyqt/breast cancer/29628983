We aimed to evaluate the association between stromaltumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (sTIL) or FcrR polymorphisms and survival amongpatients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who were treated withtrastuzumab.Methods: A total of 56 women with recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breastcancer who received the trastuzumab-taxane combination as first-line treatmentwere included in this retrospective analysis. The single-step multiplexallele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction technique was employed forFcrR3A genotyping. sTILs were identified via immunohistochemical analysis ofsurgical (n=34, 60.7%) or biopsy specimens of metastatic lesions (n=22, 39.3%).Results: We classified patients based on the sTIL level (â‰¤10% [n=44] or >10%[n=12]); high sTIL counts were more commonly observed in patients with hormonereceptor-negative tumors than in those with hormone receptor-positive tumors(34.8% vs. 12.1%, p=0.02). There was a significant association between high sTIL levels and longer progression-free survival in comparison to low sTIL levels(median, 28.4 months vs. 16.8 months; p=0.03). With regard to the FcrR3A-158genotype, patients were classified into the Phenylalanine/Phenylalanine group (23patients, 41.1%), Phenylalanine/Valine group (23 patients, 41,1%), orValine/Valine group (10 patients, 17.9%); these classifications were notassociated with clinical outcomes.Conclusion: High sTIL expression may be associated with better efficacy oftrastuzumab-containing therapy in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breastcancer. However, this finding warrants further evaluation in the largerpopulation.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.1.45 PMCID: PMC5880965PMID: 29628983
