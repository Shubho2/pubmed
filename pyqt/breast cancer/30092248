Compared to the other GLS isoform, thekidney-type glutaminase (KGA), GAC is more enzymatically efficient and ofparticular importance for cancer cell growth. Although its catalytic mechanism iswell understood, little is known about how post-translational modifications canimpact GAC function. Here, we identified by mass spectrometry a phosphorylatedserine at the GLS N-terminal domain (at position 95) and investigated its role onregulating GAC activity. The ectopic expression of the phosphomimetic mutant(GAC.S95D) in breast cancer cells, compared to wild-type GAC (GAC.WT), led todecreased glutaminase activity, glutamine uptake, glutamate release andintracellular glutamate levels, without changing GAC sub-cellular localization.Interestingly, cells expressing the GAC.S95D mutant, compared to GAC.WT,presented decreased migration and vimentin level, an epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition marker. These results reveal that GAC is post-translationallyregulated by phosphorylation, which affects cellular glutamine metabolism andglutaminase-related cell phenotype.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et BiologieMoléculaire (SFBBM).
