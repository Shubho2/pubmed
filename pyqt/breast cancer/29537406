Email: alakendu.sekhar@thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk.Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is a devastating condition with very poorprognosis. With advances in cancer treatment leading to improved survival insolid tumours, the incidence of ante-mortem diagnosis of leptomeningealcarcinomatosis is likely to rise. Without a high index of suspicion andappropriate imaging the diagnosis can be missed. We report two cases ofleptomeningeal carcinomatosis secondary to metastatic breast disease with varied clinical presentation where the diagnosis was initially missed.DOI: 10.4997/JRCPE.2017.409 PMID: 29537406
