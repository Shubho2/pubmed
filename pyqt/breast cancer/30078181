[Epub ahead of print]Analysis of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine gene variants and serum cytokine levels as prognostic markers in breast cancer.Kaur RP(1), Vasudeva K(1), Singla H(1), Benipal RPS(2), Khetarpal P(1), MunshiA(1).Author information: (1)Department of Human Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Central University ofPunjab, Bathinda, India.(2)Department of Radiology, Guru Gobind Singh Medical College & Hospital,Faridkot, India.The aim of current study was to evaluate the genetic variation in all the genesencoding pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in association with breast cancerdevelopment in patients from Malwa region of Punjab. The importance of the levelsof interleukin (IL)-17, tumor necrosis factor, interferon γ, IL-10, IL-6, IL-4,and IL-2 with respect to clinicopathological data, prognosis, and disease-freesurvival was also determined in these patients. Two hundred and fifty femalebreast cancer patients and 250 age-matched controls were screened for variations in cytokine-encoding genes using global screening array microchip and PCR-RFLP.The level of cytokines was estimated in 150 patients and 60 age-matched controls using BD™ Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) Human Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine kit by BDAccuri flow cytometer. The difference in cytokine levels was evaluated byMann-Whitney test. No significant variation in the genes encoding variouscytokines was found between patients and controls. Out of the seven cytokinesevaluated, the levels of IL-6 and IL-17a were found to be significantly high inpatients in comparison with controls ( p = 0.001 and 0.02, respectively). Theelevated levels of these cytokines are also associated significantly with pooroutcome. We did not find any specific variation in the genes encoding variouscytokines between patients and controls. However, there was a significantdifference in the serum levels of IL-6 and IL-17a between patients and controls, and the elevated levels of these two cytokines associated significantly with pooroutcome in breast cancer patients and, therefore, can be used as prognosticmarkers.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26901 PMID: 30078181
