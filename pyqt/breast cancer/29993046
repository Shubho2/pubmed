However, two different infrared imagingtechniques have been used to map the non-cytotoxic cyrhetrenyl analogue offerrociphenol in a single cell. This observation prompted us to tag twoferrocifens with a cyrhetrenyl unit [CpRe(CO)3; Cp = η5-cyclopentadienyl] bygrafting it, via an ester bond, either to one of the phenols (4, 5) or to thehydroxypropyl chain (6). Complexes 4-6 retained a high cytotoxicity on breastcancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with IC50 values in the range 0.32-2.5 μM. TransmissionIR spectroscopy was used to quantify the amount of cyrhetrenyl tag present incells incubated with 5 or 6. The results show that after a 1-hour incubation ofcells at 37 °C, complexes 5 and 6 are mainly present within cells while only alimited percentage, quantified by ICP-OES, remained in the incubation medium.AFM-IR spectroscopy, a technique coupling infrared irradiation with near-fieldAFM detection, was used to map the cyrhetrenyl unit in a single MDA-MB-231 cell, incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour with 10 μM of 6. The results show that signaldistribution of the characteristic band of the Re(CO)3 entity at 1950 cm-1matched those of amide and phosphate, thus indicating a location of the complexmainly in the cell nucleus.DOI: 10.1039/c8dt01582a PMID: 29993046
