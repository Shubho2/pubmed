Apooled analysis of 12 case-control studies showed a 10% decrease in ovariancancer risk with regular aspirin use, which was stronger for daily and low-doseusers. To prospectively investigate associations of analgesic use with ovariancancer, we analyzed data from 13 studies in the Ovarian Cancer Cohort Consortium (OC3).Methods: The current study included 758 829 women who at study enrollmentself-reported analgesic use, among whom 3514 developed ovarian cancer. Using Cox regression, we assessed associations between frequent medication use and risk of ovarian cancer. Dose and duration were also evaluated. All statistical tests weretwo-sided.Results: Women who used aspirin almost daily (≥6 days/wk) vs infrequent/nonuseexperienced a 10% reduction in ovarian cancer risk (rate ratio [RR] = 0.90, 95%confidence interval [CI] = 0.82 to 1.00, P = .05). Frequent use (≥4 days/wk) ofaspirin (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.03), nonaspirin nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; RR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.90 to 1.11), oracetaminophen (RR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.24) was not associated with risk.Daily acetaminophen use (RR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.65, P = .05) wasassociated with elevated ovarian cancer risk. Risk estimates for frequent,long-term (10+ years) use of aspirin (RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.34) ornonaspirin NSAIDs (RR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.84 to 1.68) were modestly elevated,although not statistically significantly so.Conclusions: This large, prospective analysis suggests that women who use aspirindaily have a slightly lower risk of developing ovarian cancer (∼10% lower thaninfrequent/nonuse)-similar to the risk reduction observed in case-controlanalyses. The observed potential elevated risks for 10+ years of frequent aspirinand NSAID use require further study but could be due to confounding by medicalindications for use or variation in drug dosing.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy100 PMID: 29860330
