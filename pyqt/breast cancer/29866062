However, the burden of pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) andsubsequent care is understudied in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Here, we describethe characteristics, diagnostic delays and treatment of women with PABC seekingcare at a rural cancer referral facility in Rwanda.METHODS: Data from female patients aged 18-50 years with pathologically confirmedbreast cancer who presented for treatment between July 1, 2012 and February 28,2014 were retrospectively reviewed. PABC was defined as breast cancer diagnosedin a woman who was pregnant or breastfeeding. Numbers and frequencies arereported for demographic and diagnostic delay variables and Wilcoxon rank sum andFisher's exact tests are used to compare characteristics of women with PABC towomen with non-PABC at the alpha = 0.05 significance level. Treatment andoutcomes are described for women with PABC only.RESULTS: Of the 117 women with breast cancer, 12 (10.3%) had PABC based onmedical record review. The only significant demographic differences were thatwomen with PABC were younger (p = 0.006) and more likely to be married(p = 0.035) compared to women with non-PABC. There were no significantdifferences in diagnostic delays or stage at diagnosis between women with PABCand women with non-PABC women. Eleven of the women with PABC received treatment, three had documented treatment delays or modifications due to their pregnancy or breastfeeding, and four stopped breastfeeding to initiate treatment. At the endof the study period, six patients were alive, three were deceased and threepatients were lost to follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: PABC was relatively common in our cohort but may have beenunderreported. Although patients with PABC did not experience greater diagnostic delays, most had treatment modifications, emphasizing the potential value ofPABC-specific treatment protocols in SSA. Larger prospective studies of PABC are needed to better understand particular challenges faced by these patients andinform policies and practices to optimize care for women with PABC in Rwanda and similar settings.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4535-y PMCID: PMC5987575PMID: 29866062
