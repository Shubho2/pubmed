Among radiation-delivery techniques, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is more expensive than 3-dimensional conformal RT (3DCRT). Based onthis evidence, in 2013, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)recommended hypofractionated schedules for women aged ≥50 years with early-stage breast cancer and avoiding routine use of IMRT for WBRT. To assess response tolevel I evidence and adherence to ASTRO recommendations, we evaluated the patternof RT use for early-stage breast cancer at our National Comprehensive CancerNetwork institution from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013 and compared the resultswith national trends.Methods: Data from a prospective database were extracted to include patientstreated with BCT, aged ≥50 years, with histologic findings of invasive ductalcarcinoma, stage T1-T2N0M0, estrogen receptor-positive, and HER2 normal. Weretrospectively reviewed the medical records and estimated costs based on 2016Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (technical fees) and MedicarePhysician Fee Schedule (professional fees).Results: Among 55 cases from 2006 to 2008, treatment regimens were 11%hypofractionated, 69% traditional schedule, and 20% RT omission (29% of patients were aged >70 years). Among 83 cases from 2011 to 2013, treatment regimens were54% hypofractionated, 19% traditional schedule, and 27% RT omission (48% ofpatients were aged >70 years). 3DCRT was used for all WBRT treatments. Directmedical cost estimates were as follows: 15 fractions 3DCRT, $7,197.87; 15fractions IMRT, $11,232.33; 25 fractions 3DCRT, $9,731.39; and 25 fractions IMRT,$16,877.45.Conclusion: Despite apparent resistance to shorter radiation schedules in theUnited States, we demonstrate that rapid practice change in response to level Ievidence is feasible. Wider adoption of evidence-based guidelines in early-stage breast cancer may substantially lower health care costs and improve conveniencefor patients without sacrificing oncologic outcomes.DOI: 10.2147/BCTT.S153117 PMCID: PMC5810527PMID: 29445299
