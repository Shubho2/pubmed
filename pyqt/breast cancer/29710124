Variation inthese clinical categories across and within radiologists has led to discussionabout whether automated BI-RADS density should be reported instead.Objective: To determine whether breast cancer risk and detection are similar for automated and clinical BI-RADS density measures.Design: Case-control.Setting: San Francisco Mammography Registry and Mayo Clinic.Participants: 1609 women with screen-detected cancer, 351 women with intervalinvasive cancer, and 4409 matched control participants.Measurements: Automated and clinical BI-RADS density assessed on digitalmammography at 2 time points from September 2006 to October 2014, interval andscreen-detected breast cancer risk, and mammography sensitivity.Results: Of women whose breast density was categorized by automated BI-RADS more than 6 months to 5 years before diagnosis, those with extremely dense breasts hada 5.65-fold higher interval cancer risk (95% CI, 3.33 to 9.60) and a 1.43-foldhigher screen-detected risk (CI, 1.14 to 1.79) than those with scatteredfibroglandular densities. Associations of interval and screen-detected cancerwith clinical BI-RADS density were similar to those with automated BI-RADSdensity, regardless of whether density was measured more than 6 months to lessthan 2 years or 2 to 5 years before diagnosis. Automated and clinical BI-RADSdensity measures had similar discriminatory accuracy, which was higher forinterval than screen-detected cancer (c-statistics: 0.70 vs. 0.62 [P < 0.001] and0.72 vs. 0.62 [P < 0.001], respectively). Mammography sensitivity was similar forautomated and clinical BI-RADS categories: fatty, 93% versus 92%; scatteredfibroglandular densities, 90% versus 90%; heterogeneously dense, 82% versus 78%; and extremely dense, 63% versus 64%, respectively.Limitation: Neither automated nor clinical BI-RADS density was assessed ontomosynthesis, an emerging breast screening method.Conclusion: Automated and clinical BI-RADS density similarly predict interval andscreen-detected cancer risk, suggesting that either measure may be used to informwomen of their breast density.Primary Funding Source: National Cancer Institute.DOI: 10.7326/M17-3008 PMID: 29710124
