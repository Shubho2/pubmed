Wehypothesized that metabolically adaptable (MA) cancer cells selected from theSUM149 cell line in this manner have the capacity to survive a variety ofchallenges that postulated "decathlon winner" cancer cells must survive tosucceed in metastasis. These MA cells were resistant to glutaminase inhibitorCB-839, as predicted from their ability to proliferate without exogenousglutamine. They were also resistant to hypoxia, surviving treatment with hypoxia inducer cobalt chloride. Investigating the nature of intrinsic resistance inSUM149-MA cells, we found that 1-2 mM metformin completely inhibited theemergence of MA colonies in SUM149 cells in glutamine-free medium. These highlyresistant MA cells grew into colonies upon removal of metformin, indicating that they survived in quiescence for several weeks under metformin treatment. Thisapproach of selecting resistant cells worked equally well with additional TNBCcell lines, specifically inflammatory breast cancer cell line FC-IBC02 and mouse breast cancer cell line 4T07. In both cases, less than 1% of cells survivedmetformin treatment and formed colonies in glutamine-free medium. The MA cellsselected in this manner were significantly more resistant to the chemotherapeuticdrug doxorubicin than the parental cell lines. We conclude that our approach may be useful in developing usable models of cancer cell quiescence and therapyresistance in TNBC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24322 PMCID: PMC5834289PMID: 29541397
