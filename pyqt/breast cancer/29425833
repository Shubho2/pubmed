Recent years, tumor-associatevessel formation is considered as a more generally and effective target topatient with malignant cancer. Our previous studies indicated that miR-19b-1controls the intrinsic angiogenic activity of human umbilical vein endothelialcells (HUVECs) in vitro. In this study, in silico analysis indicated VEZF1 thatimplicates in angiogenesis and triple-negative breast cancer progression might bethe target of miR-19b-1. Further investigation showed that overexpressingmiR-19b-1 in human triple-negative breast cancer cell line(MDA-MB-231) led toimpaired angiogenic activity of HUVECs in vitro and in vivo. Additionally,miR-19b-1 upregulation inhibited the vessel imitation mediated by MDA-MB-231.Furthermore, enforced expression of miR-19b-1 in MDA-MB-231 has impact on HUVECs apoptosis and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential, which suggested thepossible mechanism involved in interaction between breast cancer and endothelial cells. What's more, we found that miR-19b-1 stable overexpression in MDA-MB-231caused tumor growth arresting entirely. Besides, our results suggested thatmiR-19b-1 could inhibit angiogenesis by possibly targeting VEGF receptorendocytosis signaling pathway. Taking together, our findings suggest an importantrole of miR-19b-1 in crosstalk between metastatic breast cancer and endothelialcells and provide us new insights for exploring miR-19b-1 and its multipletargets as promising therapeutic candidates to interfere breast cancerprogression.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
