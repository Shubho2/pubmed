The MPEG-PLH-VESnanoparticles (NPs) were subsequently functionalized with biotin motif fortargeted drug delivery. The MPEG-PLH-VES copolymer exerts no obvious effect onthe P-gp expression level of MCF-7/ADR but exhibited a significant influence onthe loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the reduction of intracellular ATP level, and the inhibition of P-gp ATPase activity of MCF-7/ADR cells. Theconstructed MPEG-PLH-VES NPs exhibited an acidic pH-induced increase on particle size in aqueous solution. The DOX-encapsulated MPEG-PLH-VES/biotin-PEG-VES(MPEG-PLH-VES/B) NPs were characterized to possess high drug encapsulationefficiency of approximate 90%, an average particle size of approximately 130 nm, and a pH-responsive drug release profile in acidic milieu. Confocal laserscanning microscopy (CLSM) investigations revealed that the DOX-loaded NPsresulted in an effective delivery of DOX into MCF-/ADR cells and a notablecarrier-facilitated escape from endolysosomal entrapment. Pertaining to the invitro cytotoxicity evaluation, the DOX-loaded MPEG-PLH-VES/B NPs resulted in morepronounced cytotoxicity to MCF-/ADR cells compared with DOX-loaded MPEG-PLH-VESNPs and free DOX solution. In vivo imaging study in MCF-7/ADR tumor-engraftedmice exhibited that the MPEG-PLH-VES/B NPs accumulated at the tumor site moreeffectively than MPEG-PLH-VES NPs due to the biotin-mediated active targetingeffect. In accordance with the in vitro results, DOX-loaded MPEG-PLH-VES/B NPsshowed the strongest inhibitory effect against the MCF-7/ADR xenografted tumorswith negligible systemic toxicity, as evidenced by the histological analysis and change of body weight. The multifunctional MPEG-PLH-VES/B nanoparticulate system has been demonstrated to provide a promising strategy for efficient delivery ofDOX into MCF-7/ADR cancerous cells and reversing MDR.DOI: 10.1021/acs.biomac.8b00213 PMID: 29618203
