The association between cancer coping and cancer recovery is not well established. The present study investigated thecancer-coping profile and cancer outcomes in breast cancer survivors.METHODS: A three-wave longitudinal study was conducted. In 2009 (wave 1), 248breast cancer survivors completed a package of psychological inventories toevaluate cancer copying style, psychological distress, anxiety and depression,and quality of life. They received follow-up survey in 2012 (wave 2) and 2016(wave 3). A latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted among participants inwave 1 to identify cancer-coping class. Identified cancer-coping class was usedto predict psychological and survival outcomes in waves 2 and 3.RESULTS: Two cancer-coping classes were identified through LPA, namely adaptivecancer coping (class I; 52%) and maladaptive cancer coping (class II; 47.8%).Demographic and clinical factors did not differ significantly between the twoclasses. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that the cancer-coping style in wave 1 predicted the psychological symptoms and quality of life outcomes at the twofollow-ups (waves 2 and 3). Survivors in the adaptive group (class I) exhibitedlower cancer distress, anxiety and depression scores, and higher quality of life scores than those in the maladaptive group did. Cancer coping were not found tobe significantly associated with cancer survival or recurrence.CONCLUSIONS: The identified cancer-coping styles were predictive of thesurvivors' psychological symptoms, psychological well-being, and health-relatedquality of life but not cancer survival or recurrence.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4382-z PMID: 30088138
