Thisdata shows that Brazilin A, a natural bioactive compound in heartwood ofCaesalpinia sappan L.induced cell death in breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. Thetherapeutic property was further proved by docking the Brazilin A moleculeagainst BCL-2 protein (an apoptotic inhibitor) using auto dock tools.DOI: 10.1016/j.dib.2018.05.050 PMCID: PMC5997910PMID: 29900385
