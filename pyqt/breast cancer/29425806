However, doxorubicin has limitations in clinical use because ofdose-dependent cardiotoxicity and drug resistance. Despite of previously reportedstudies about mechanisms of doxorubicin resistance including overexpression ofP-gp and abnormal expression and mutation of topoisomerase IIα, resistance tothis agent still abundantly occur and is regarded as a major obstacle tosuccessful treatment.METHODS: We have established doxorubicin resistant T47D cells. Intracellularcalcium and ROS levels and calpain activity were measured using fluorometricexperiments. Cell viability assay, cell cycle analysis, immunofluorescence andwestern blot analysis were performed to evaluate m-calpain specific truncation oftopoisomerase IIα and molecular mechanism in doxorubicin resistant cells.RESULTS: We observed that doxorubicin treatment increased intracellular calciumand ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) in parental and doxorubicin resistant T47Dcells. The increases in intracellular calcium and ROS were much greater indoxorubicin resistant T47D cells, which led to higher activity of calpains.Hyperactivated m-calpain, but not μ-calpain, specifically induced cleavage oftopoisomerase IIα and accumulation of truncated topoisomerase IIα in thecytoplasm. The increase in cytoplasmic truncated topoisomerase IIα reduced theefficacy of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin resistant T47D cells, with hyperactivatedm-calpain and truncated cytosolic topoisomerase IIα, obtained cross-resistance toother topoisomerase II-targeting drugs.CONCLUSION: Hyperactivated m-calpain induced cytoplasmic accumulation oftruncated topoisomerase IIα in doxorubicin resistant T47D cells.GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These data provide a new mechanism of doxorubicinresistance and suggest a novel strategy for overcoming drug resistance intopoisomerase IIα-targeting therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
