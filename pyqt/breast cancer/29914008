[Epub ahead of print]MiR-17-5p may serve as a novel predictor for breast cancer recurrence.Wang Y, Li J, Dai L, Zheng J, Yi Z, Chen L.BACKGROUND: Recurrence following conventional therapies in patients with breastcancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This study aimed toinvestigate potential predictive biomarkers for breast cancer recurrenceespecially microRNAs (miRNAs).METHODS: The primary breast cancer patients who were scheduled to undergocurative resection in our hospital from May 2007 to May 2012 were recruited inthis study. Clinical and pathological characteristics were compared in patientswith or without recurrence. The expressions of tissue miRNAs by quantitativereverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were also analyzed inpatients with recurrence or not. Multivariate Cox analysis was fit to evaluatepotential predicative factors for breast cancer recurrence. Kaplan-Meier plotswas conducted to further evaluate the association between miR-17-5p expressionand recurrence-free survival (RFS).RESULTS: A total of 133 consecutive patients were enrolled into the finalanalysis and 29 of them have suffered recurrence within 5 years after theoperation. Our results revealed tissue miR-17-5p expression as an independentrisk factor for breast cancer recurrence (HR: 4.45; 95% CI: 1.58-11.53, P=0.015). Patients with a higher miR-17-5p expression was significantly associated with a worse 5-year RFS by log-rank test (p= 0.017).CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that miR-17-5p might be a useful predictivefactor for breast cancer recurrence.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-181228 PMID: 29914008
