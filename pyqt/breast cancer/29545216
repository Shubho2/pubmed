[Epubahead of print]Inhibiting pulmonary metastasis of breast cancer based on dual-targeting grapheneoxide with high stability and drug loading capacity.Li J(1), Liang X(1), Zhang J(1), Yin Y(1), Zuo T(1), Wang Y(1), Yang X(1), ShenQ(2).Author information: (1)School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.(2)School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. Electronicaddress: qshen@sjtu.edu.cn.In this study, heparin and polyethyleneimine-folic acid modified graphene oxidewas designed and synthesized as a dual-targeting biomaterial to load doxorubicin (DOX@GPFH) with high loading capacity for enhanced cellular uptake. GDC0941, aphosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/Akt phosphorylation inhibitor, was selected toenhance anti-metastasis effect of DOX@GPFH via down-regulating expression ofmatrix metalloproteinase. Modified with heparin, the stability of DOX@GPFH wassignificantly enhanced and the drug loading ratio increased largely from 64.4% to125.1%. The inhibition rates of the mixture of DOX@GPFH and GDC0941 in vitro bywound healing, cell migration and invasion assays were 61.2%±13.9%, 81.0%±3.6%and 76.8%±5.2%, respectively, while the tumor and the pulmonary anti-metastasisrates tested in vivo were 77.0%±7.6% and 73.7%±9.6%, respectively. Our findingsillustrated an effective approach for developing dual-targeting graphene oxidewith high drug loading for pulmonary anti-metastasis of breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
