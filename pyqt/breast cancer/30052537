[Epub ahead ofprint]Cardiovascular Effects of Chemotherapy Used in the Treatment of Breast Cancers.Rozner RN(1), Frishman WH(2).Author information: (1)Departments of Medicine, New York Presbyterian/Weill-Cornell Medical Center,New York, NY.(2)New York Medical College/Westchester Medical Center, Valhalla, NY.Attempts to carry out clinical trials to improve the treatment of breast cancers,including chemotherapy and targeted oncologic therapies, often exclude women withbaseline cardiovascular compromise, such as low ejection fraction or arrhythmia. Therefore, despite concrete evidence of cardiotoxicity from a select number ofchemotherapeutic agents, it has been difficult to better characterize theprogression of cardiac dysfunction in women with pre-existing cardiac conditions who receive chemotherapy. Women who have impaired cardiac function should beincluded in future clinical trials, or at least placed in separate trials withcareful monitoring, to better assess this high-risk population. This article willdiscuss the epidemiology, mechanisms, diagnostic methods, and management ofcardiotoxicity from systemic chemotherapy used to treat breast cancer.DOI: 10.1097/CRD.0000000000000225 PMID: 30052537
