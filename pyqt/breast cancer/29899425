With the ethical approval, 560 patients who were pathologicallyconfirmed as invasive breast carcinoma were reviewed for ultrasound, clinical,and pathological data. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify thetypical sonographic features for TN invasive breast carcinomas. The effect ofclinical and pathological factors on the sonographic features of TN invasivebreast carcinoma was studied. There were 104 cases of TN invasive breastcarcinoma. The independent sonographic features for the TN subgroup includedregular shape (odds ratio, OR = 2.14, p = 0.007), no spiculated/angular margin(OR = 1.93, p = 0.035), posterior acoustic enhancement (OR = 2.14, p = 0.004),and no calcifications (OR = 2.10, p = 0.008). Higher pathological grade wassignificantly associated with regular tumor shape of TN breast cancer(p = 0.012). Higher Ki67 level was significantly associated with regular tumorshape (p = 0.023) and absence of angular/spiculated margin (p = 0.005). Higherhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) score was significantlyassociated with the presence of calcifications (p = 0.033). We conclude that foursonographic features are associated with TN invasive breast carcinoma.Heterogeneity of sonographic features was associated with the pathological grade,Ki67 proliferation level and HER2 score of TN breast cancers.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27222-6 PMCID: PMC5998063PMID: 29899425
