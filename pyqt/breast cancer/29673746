Based on an original clinical case,we provide a clinical update concerning ectopic breast and ectopic carcinoma,including Paget's disease.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 44-year-old woman had complained of pain in the area ofher supernumerary breast for several months. The ultrasound examination wasnormal but the unexplained symptoms led to performance of an excision biopsy ofthe lesion. This showed strictly intra-epidermal Paget's disease measuring 2mm,without any underlying carcinoma. A wider excision was performed. Follow-up atone year showed no recurrence.DISCUSSION: An ectopic breast, present in 6 % of the population, is oftenignored, despite being subject to the same diseases as anatomical breasts: it is at the origin of 0.6 % of breast cancers. Paget's disease is a rare in situadenocarcinoma comprising fewer than 3 % of cases of breast cancer. It isextremely rare in ectopic breast. Ours is only the fourth reported case in theliterature. This case is original because of the lack of objective clinicalsigns. Subjective symptoms such as pain, tingling, burning sensation and pruritusrelated to the supernumerary breast must be taken into consideration in order to enable early diagnosis of Paget's disease. Exploration by ultrasound andmammography generally appears flawed. Breast MRI may be useful but is notperformed routinely. A promising future approach may consist of confocalmicroscopy screening of all ectopic breasts with areola or nipple patches, since this method enables the visualization of Paget cells and their organization.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
