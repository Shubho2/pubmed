Electronic address: yliang@must.edu.mo.Methods based on a L1/2 penalty have been utilized to solve the variableselection problem associated with the Cox proportional hazards model. Onelimitation of the existing methods for survival analysis is that these ignore theregulatory networks and pathways information. To merge prior pathway information into the analysis of genomic data, we proposed a network-based regularizationmethod for the L1/2 penalty and applied it to high-dimensional survival analysis data. This method used a L1/2 regularized solver and network that penalizes a Coxproportional hazards model with respect to the sparsity of the regression and thesmoothness between the coefficients in a given network. Based on the limitedsimulation studies and real breast cancer gene expression datasets, theexperimental results showed that our method achieves a higher predictive accuracythan previous methods. Even though fewer genes were selected compared to thoseusing previous methods, results showed stronger associations with cancer. Theresults of the analysis were also validated using GeneCards.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2018.07.009 PMID: 30032047
