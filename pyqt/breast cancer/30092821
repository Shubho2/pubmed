There is no consensus about which type of data (e.g. copy number, mutation, histology) and especially which statistical method is mostsuitable to distinguish clonal recurrences from independent primary tumours.METHODS: Thirty-seven invasive breast tumour pairs were stratified according tolaterality and time interval between the diagnoses of the two tumours. In amulti-omics approach, tumour clonality was analysed by integrating clinicalcharacteristics (n = 37), DNA copy number (n = 37), DNA methylation (n = 8), geneexpression microarray (n = 7), RNA sequencing (n = 3), and SNP genotyping data(n = 3). Different statistical methods, e.g. the diagnostic similarity index(SI), were used to classify the tumours as clonally related recurrences orindependent primary tumours.RESULTS: The SI and hierarchical clustering showed similar tendencies and thehighest concordance with the other methods. Concordant evidence for tumourclonality was found in 46% (17/37) of patients. Notably, no association was foundbetween the current clinical guidelines and molecular tumour features.CONCLUSIONS: A more accurate classification of clonal relatedness betweenmultiple breast tumours may help to mitigate treatment failure and relapse byintegrating tumour-associated molecular features, clinical parameters, andstatistical methods. Guidelines need to be defined with exact thresholds tostandardise clonality testing in a routine diagnostic setting.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1022-y PMID: 30092821
