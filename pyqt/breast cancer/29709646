Cameroonian medicinal plantsinvestigated in this work are traditionally used to treat cancer or ailments withrelevance to cancer or cancer-like symptoms.AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, 21 methanol extracts from 18 Cameroonianmedicinal plants were tested in leukemia CCRF-CEM cells, and the best extractswere further tested on a panel of human cancer cell lines, including variousmulti-drug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes. Mechanistic studies were performed withthe three best extracts.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluatecytotoxicity and ferroptotic effects of methanol extracts from different plants. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) of extracts from Curcuma longarhizomes (CLR), Lycopersicon esculentum leaves (LEL), and Psidium guajava bark(PGB).RESULTS: In a pre-screening of all extracts, 13 out of 21 (61.9%) had IC50 valuesbelow 80 µg/mL. Six of these active extracts displayed IC50 values below30 µg/mL: Cola pachycarpa leaves (CPL), Curcuma longa rhizomes (CLR),Lycopersicon esculentum leaves, Persea americana bark (PAB), Physalis peruvianatwigs (PPT) and Psidium guajava bark (PGB). The best extracts displayed IC50values from 6.25 µg/mL (against HCT116 p53-/-) to 10.29 µg/mL (towards breastadenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231-BCRP cells) for CLR, from 9.64 µg/mL (against breastadenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells) to 57.74 µg/mL (against HepG2 cells) for LEL andfrom 1.29 µg/mL (towards CEM/ADR5000 cells) to 62.64 µg/mL (towards MDA-MB-231cells) for PGB. CLR and PGB induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells via caspasesactivation, MMP depletion and increase ROS production whilst LEL inducedapoptosis mediated by caspases activation and increase ROS production.CONCLUSION: The best botanicals tested were CLR and LEL, which are worth to beexplored in more detail to fight cancers including MDR phenotypes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
