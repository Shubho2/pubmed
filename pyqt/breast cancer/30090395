Current reports indicate that HDACis may also be anattractive radiosensitizer for some tumor cells; however, it is unknown whetherthe safe blood concentration of VPA (0.3-0.8 mM) used for the treatment ofepilepsy can also induce radiosensitivity in breast cancer cells. In addition,the mechanism by which VPA may induce radiosensitivity in breast cancer cells is yet to be determined. Our results clearly indicated that VPA at a safe dose (0.5 mM) could significantly increase the radiosensitivity of MCF7 breast cancer cellsand result in more accumulation of DNA double strand breaks in response to DNAdamage. After VPA treatment, the frequencies of homologous recombination (HR) andnon-homologous end joining (NHEJ) tested by recombination substrates, pDR-GFP andEJ5-GFP, were dramatically decreased in the cells without the change of the cell cycle profile. It was further found that VPA could inhibit the recruitment of keyrepair proteins to DNA break areas, such as Rad51, BRCA1, and Ku80. Thus, ourresults demonstrated that a safe dose of VPA causes radiosensitivity in breastcancer cells through disrupting the molecular mechanisms of bothBRCA1-Rad51-mediated HR and Ku80-mediated NHEJ pathways.DOI: 10.1039/c5tx00476d PMCID: PMC6060714PMID: 30090395
