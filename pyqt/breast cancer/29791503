Aim of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of PETimaging with [18F]FDG and [18F]FLT for the discrimination of TNBC responders toPaclitaxel (PTX) therapy compared to the response assessed by an adapted ResponseEvaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria based on tumor volume(Tumor Volume Response).METHODS: Nu/nu mice bearing TNBC lesions of different size were evaluated with[18F]FDG and [18F]FLT PET before and after PTX treatment. SUVmax, Metabolic TumorVolume (MTV) and Total Lesion Glycolysis (TLG) and Proliferation (TLP) wereassessed using a graph-based random walk algorithm.RESULTS: We found that in our TNBC model the variation of [18F]FDG and [18F]FLTSUVmax similarly defined tumor response to therapy and that SUVmax variationrepresented the most accurate parameter. Response evaluation using Tumor VolumeResponse (TVR) showed that the effectiveness of NAC with PTX was completelyindependent from lesions size at baseline.CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided interesting results in terms of sensitivity andspecificity of PET in TNBC, revealing the similar performances of [18F]FDG and[18F]FLT in the identification of responders to Paclitaxel.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197754 PMCID: PMC5965848PMID: 29791503
