Site of first distant relapse was categorized as 'soft tissue,' 'visceral,' 'skeletal,' 'central nervous system (CNS),' and'other.' The association between relapse site and achievement of pCR was assessedusing multivariate logistic regression models for molecular subtypesclassification and preceding locoregional recurrence.RESULTS: The study included 383 (21%) eligible patients out of the 1856randomized, of whom 28 (7%) had achieved pCR. Median follow-up was 5.4 years.Achievement of pCR was associated with a trend towards a decreased presentationof skeletal metastases [21% (pCR) vs. 50% (non-pCR), OR 0.32, adjusted pvalue = 0.071] and an increase in the proportion of patients with CNS metastases as first distant relapse site (21% vs. 9%, OR 2.39, adjusted p value = 0.183).Patients with pCR were more likely to present with only one relapse locationcategory when compared to non-pCR (86% vs. 69%).CONCLUSION: Patients that achieved a pCR appeared less likely to present withskeletal metastases and more frequently presented with CNS metastases as firstsite of distant relapse, even after adjustment for molecular subtypes.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4698-x PMID: 29435853
