Thepurpose of this study was to evaluate interobserver agreement regarding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) descriptors important in determining eligibility formastectomy, and to investigate the significance of enhancement extending to theareola concerning nipple-areolar complex (NAC) involvement.METHODS: Fifty-one cases with histologically confirmed NAC involvement and 54cases with negative NAC were enrolled. Two radiologists assessed the followingfactors: lesion morphology (mass or non-mass enhancement); intra-nipple brightsignal; enhancement extending to the areola; abnormal nipple enhancement; andtumor-nipple distance. Factors that showed a significant association with outcomein the univariate analysis were assessed by means of multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model. Interobserver agreement between observers wasassessed by calculating κ values (dichotomous variables), or intraclasscorrelation coefficients (ICCs; continuous variables).RESULTS: In multivariate analysis of the results from the two observers,tumor-nipple distance (observer 1: odds ratio [OR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-0.99; observer 2: OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.83-0.95) and enhancement extending to the areola (observer 1: OR 17.9; 95% CI 1.97-162.2; observer 2: OR 24.0; 95%CI 2.62-219.7) were found to be significant predictors of NAC involvement. Asubstantial agreement (κ = 0.64-0.71) for every dichotomous variable and analmost perfect agreement (ICC = 0.86) for continuous variable were observed.CONCLUSIONS: Findings of breast MRI for NAC preservation had good interobserveragreement. Enhancement extending to the areola, together with tumor-nippledistance, was significant factors for NAC involvement.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0845-9 PMID: 29464515
