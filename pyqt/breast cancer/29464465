Cancer patients are polymedicated, which involves high risk ofdrug interactions during therapy. The aim of the study was to assess theinteraction between lapatinib and paracetamol in rats. The rats were divided intothree groups of eight animals in each. One group received lapatinib + paracetamol(IL + PA), another group received lapatinib (IIL), whereas the last groupreceived paracetamol (IIIPA). A single dose of lapatinib (100 mg/kg b.w.) andparacetamol (100 mg/kg b.w.) was administered orally. Plasma concentrations oflapatinib, paracetamol and its metabolites - glucuronide and sulphate, weremeasured with the validated HPLC-MS/MS method and HPLC-UV method, respectively.The pharmacokinetic parameters of both drugs were calculated usingnon-compartmental methods. The co-administration of lapatinib and paracetamolincreased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and themaximum concentration (Cmax) of lapatinib by 239.6% (p = 0.0030) and 184%(p = 0.0011), respectively. Lapatinib decreased the paracetamol AUC0-∞ by 48.8%and Cmax by 55.7%. In the IL + PA group the Cmax of paracetamol glucuronide wasreduced, whereas the Cmax of paracetamol sulphate was higher than in the IIIPAgroup. Paracetamol significantly affected the enhanced plasma exposure oflapatinib. Additionally, lapatinib reduced the concentrations of paracetamol. Theco-administration of lapatinib decreased the paracetamol glucuronidation butincreased the sulphation. The findings of this study may be of clinical relevanceto patients requiring analgesic therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s10637-018-0573-1 PMID: 29464465
