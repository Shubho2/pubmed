We prospectively evaluated the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of axitinib, objective response rate, and adverse events in 44 consecutiveadvanced RCC patients treated with axitinib. To establish a model for predicting clinical efficacy and adverse events, polymorphisms in genes including ABCtransporters (ABCB1 and ABCG2), UGT1A, and OR2B11 were analyzed by whole-exomesequencing, Sanger sequencing, and DNA microarray. To validate this predictionmodel, calculated AUC by 6 gene polymorphisms was compared with actual AUC in 16 additional consecutive patients prospectively. Actual AUC significantlycorrelated with the objective response rate (P = 0.0002) and adverse events(hand-foot syndrome, P = 0.0055; and hypothyroidism, P = 0.0381). Calculated AUC significantly correlated with actual AUC (P < 0.0001), and correctly predictedobjective response rate (P = 0.0044) as well as adverse events (P = 0.0191 and0.0082, respectively). In the validation study, calculated AUC prior to axitinib treatment precisely predicted actual AUC after axitinib treatment (P = 0.0066).Our pharmacogenetics-based AUC prediction model may determine the optimal initialdose of axitinib, and thus facilitate better treatment of patients with advanced RCC.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24715 PMCID: PMC5908314PMID: 29682213
