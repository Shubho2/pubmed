The ability of 37/67 LR to promote cancer cell aggressiveness is furtherincreased by its ability to transduce physiochemical and mechanosensing signalsin endothelial cells and modulate angiogenesis. Recently, it was demonstratedthat 37/67 LR modulates the anti-angiogenic potential of the secretedglycoprotein pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Restoration of PEDFbalance is a desirable therapeutic outcome, and we sought to identify a smallmolecule that could recapitulate known signaling properties of PEDF but withoutthe additional complications of peptide formulation or gene delivery safetyvalidation. We used an in silico drug discovery approach to target theinteraction interface between PEDF and 37 LR. Following cell based counterscreening and binding validation, we characterized a hit compound'santi-viability, activation of PEDF signaling-related genes, anti-wound healing,and anti-cancer signaling properties. This hit compound has potential for future development as a lead compound for treating tumor growth and inhibitingangiogenesis.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23236 PMCID: PMC5814187PMID: 29464047
