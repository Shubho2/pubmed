Electronic address: pmeier@icr.ac.uk.Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an inflammatory cytokine that can signal cellsurvival or cell death. The mechanisms that switch between these distinctoutcomes remain poorly defined. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase MindBomb-2 (MIB2) regulates TNF-induced cell death by inactivating RIPK1 viainhibitory ubiquitylation. Although depletion of MIB2 has little effect on NF-κB activation, it sensitizes cells to RIPK1- and caspase-8-dependent cell death. We find that MIB2 represses the cytotoxic potential of RIPK1 by ubiquitylatinglysine residues in the C-terminal portion of RIPK1. Our data suggest thatubiquitin conjugation of RIPK1 interferes with RIPK1 oligomerization andRIPK1-FADD association. Disruption of MIB2-mediated ubiquitylation, either bymutation of MIB2's E3 activity or RIPK1's ubiquitin-acceptor lysines, sensitizes cells to RIPK1-mediated cell death. Together, our findings demonstrate that Mind Bomb E3 ubiquitin ligases can function as additional checkpoint ofcytokine-induced cell death, selectively protecting cells from the cytotoxiceffects of TNF.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).
