The quantitative data forCEUS and the tumor diameter were collected at baseline and before surgery, andcompared with the pathological response. Multiple logistic regression analysiswas performed to examine quantitative parameters at CEUS and the tumor diameterto predict the pCR, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysiswas used as a summary statistic.RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that PEAK (the maximumintensity of the time-intensity curve during bolus transit), PEAK%, TTP% (time topeak), and diameter% were significant independent predictors of pCR, and the areaunder the ROC curve was 0.932(Az1), and the sensitivity and specificity topredict pCR were 93.7% and 80.0%. The area under the ROC curve for thequantitative parameters was 0.927(Az2), and the sensitivity and specificity topredict pCR were 81.2% and 94.3%. For diameter%, the area under the ROC curve was0.786 (Az3), and the sensitivity and specificity to predict pCR were 93.8% and54.3%. The values of Az1 and Az2 were significantly higher than that of Az3(P = 0.027 and P = 0.034, respectively). However, there was no significantdifference between the values of Az1 and Az2 (P = 0.825).CONCLUSION: Quantitative analysis of tumor blood perfusion with CEUS is superior to diameter% to predict pCR, and can be used as a functional technique toevaluate tumor response to NAC.Copyright © 2018.
