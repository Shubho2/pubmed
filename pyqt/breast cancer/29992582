We sought to evaluate nationwide surgical trends inpatients with operable breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy andfactors associated with surgical type. We used the National Cancer Database toidentify 235,339 women with unilateral T1-3N0-3M0 breast cancer diagnosed between2010 and 2014, and treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Of these, 59,568patients (25.3%) were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Rates of pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy increased from 33.3% at the startof the study period in 2010 to 46.3% at the end of the period in 2014 (p=0.02).Rates of breast-conserving surgery changed little, from 37.0% to 40.8% (p=0.22). While rates of unilateral mastectomy decreased from 43.3% to 34.7% (p=0.02) andrates of bilateral mastectomy without immediate reconstruction remained similar(11.7% to 11.5%, p=0.82), rates of bilateral mastectomy with immediatereconstruction rose from 8.0% to 13.1% (p=0.02). Patients who were younger, with private/managed care insurance, and diagnosed in more recent years were morelikely to achieve pathologic complete response; however, these samecharacteristics were associated with receipt of bilateral mastectomy (versusbreast-conserving surgery). Additionally, non-Hispanic white race and higher areaeducation attainment were both associated with bilateral mastectomy. Thesefindings did not differ by age or molecular subtype. Further study ofnon-clinical factors that influence selection of more extensive surgery despiteexcellent response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is warranted. This article isprotected by copyright.
