Electronicaddress: xguan@nju.edu.cn.Inhibition of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has shown marked benefit forbreast cancer with homologous recombination deficiency, whether driven by defectsin BRCA1, BRCA2, or other pathway components. Since the initial approval ofolaparib, a mostly investigated PARP inhibitor (PARPi), the clinical development of PARPi in breast cancer treatment has been a major emphasis. Researches ininvestigating platinum-PARPi combination use compared with platinum monotherapydemonstrated promising benefit in metastatic BRCA mutated breast cancer or TNBC, while no such superiority was observed in the neoadjuvant setting of TNBC.Moreover, the utility of PARP inhibition in BRCA1/2 mutated breast cancer withdifferent platinum-free interval was investigated. There was a clear association between clinical benefit with PARPi and platinum sensitivity, whereas partialefficacy of PARPi still occurs in platinum-resistant patients. In addition,proof-of-principle studies of immunotherapy combined with PARPi in breast cancer have obtained promising results, indicating the potential benefit of thecombination therapy in patients with breast cancer. These efforts, contributingto maximize the utility of PARPi, may drive a new era of this agent after itsfirst routine use. In this review, we summarized the utility of combiningplatinum-PARPi in BRCA mutated breast cancer or TNBC compared with platinummonotherapy and provided promising prospects of PARPi as maintenance therapy inbreast cancer, as well as providing a strong rationale for testing immunotherapy combined with PARPi in breast cancer to expand the clinical utility of PARPi.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
