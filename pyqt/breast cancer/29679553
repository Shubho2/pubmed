They have been expressed in many cancers amongthem is breast cancer. Authors aimed to investigate the expression levels ofthree circulating oncomiRNAs (miRNA-21, miRNA-222 and miRNA-373) in serum samplesas a minimally non-invasive method for early detection of breast cancer, andstudy their relation with clinicopathological characters.METHODS: MiRNAs expression levels were determined using quantitative real-timepolymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in serum samples from three groups: primarybreast cancer patients (n = 137), benign breast lesion patients (n = 60), andhealthy individuals as control group (n = 38). Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS.RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between the expression levels ofthe studied miRNAs in the investigated groups, as their median levels wereincreased in breast cancer patients followed by benign group patients then thehealthy individuals. MiRNA-373 reported the highest diagnostic efficacy ascompared to miRNA-21 and miRNA-222 with high area under the curve (AUC equals0.987). The relation between tested miRNAs and clinicopathological factorsrevealed significant difference with clinical stages and histological grades.Level of miRNA-21 and miRNA-373 were statistically significantly higher ininvasive duct carcinoma (IDC) as compared to non-IDC. Similarly, their levelswere increased in lymph node metastasis (P < 0.01). MiRNA-222 and miRNA-373 were significantly increased in positive PgR and positive Her-2/neu status,respectively.CONCLUSION: Assessment of miRNAs in serum samples can be applied as minimallynon-invasive markers for early detection of breast cancer, and as discriminatorbetween different clinicopathological characters.Copyright © 2018 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.
