We measured serum calcium, wholeparathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25OH2D3, bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP),tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b (TRACP-5b), and bone mineral density (BMD)of the lumbar 1-4 vertebrae (L-BMD) and bilateral total hips (H-BMD) for 24months.Results: The percent changes of serum calcium in the breast cancer group weresignificantly lower than those in the primary OP group at 1 week, 1 and 12months. The percent changes of whole PTH in the primary OP group weresignificantly lower than those in the breast cancer group at 2 and 4 months.Significant differences were found between the groups at 18 months (-34.5% in theprimary OP group and -52.6% in the breast cancer group, respectively) for thepercent changes of BAP. Significant differences were found between the groups at 12, 18, and 24 months (-39.7% in the primary OP group and -64.0% in the breastcancer group at 24 months, respectively) for the percent changes of TRACP-5b. Thepercent changes of L-BMD and H-BMD were significantly increased at 12, 18, and 24months in both the primary OP group (7.0% and 4.7% at 24 months, respectively)and breast cancer group (8.0% and 5.4% at 24 months, respectively), compared withpre-treatment levels. Significant differences were not found between the groupsfor the percent changes of L-BMD and H-BMD.Conclusion: Denosumab significantly increased L-BMD and H-BMD to comparabledegrees in both groups; therefore, it represents a good therapeutic option for OPreceiving breast cancer treatment as well as primary OP. Also, vitamin Dsupplementation is required due to the potential hypocalcemia, and estrogen maybe responsible for the decrease of serum calcium in the breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.2147/TCRM.S156466 PMCID: PMC5857149PMID: 29559791
