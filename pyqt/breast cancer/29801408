Email: melva.louisa@gmail.comBackground: Curcumin was shown to reduce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in previous short term studies. This study was aimed to investigate thepotential of curcumin in the prevention of EMT activation in MCF-7 cells induced by endoxifen. Methods: MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with Endoxifen 1000nM+betaestradiol 1 nM with or without curcumin (8.5μM or 17 μM). Cells treatedwith dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 0.001% were used as negative control. After 8weeks of continuous treatment, the cells were counted, analyzed for mRNAE-cadherin, vimentin, TGF-β expression, total reactive oxygen species (ROS) andobserved for morphological changes using confocal microscope and transmissionelectron microscope. Result: MCF-7 cell viability was increased in endoxifen +β-estradiol group. Cell viability was significantly decreased in curcumin 17 μM, but not in curcumin 8.5 μM group. Analysis of EMT markers at week 8 indicatesthat there were increase in vimentin and TGF-β mRNA expressions, while E-cadherinmRNA expressions and TGF-β1 protein concentrations were shown to decrease. Theresults showed that administration of curcumin in all the dose administered were incapable improving the expressions of vimentin, TGF-β1 and E-cadherin. There wasa decrease in ROS concentration in curcumin treated cells (8.5 μM) while incurcumin 17 μM, ROS concentration was increased. Morphological observation using confocal microscope and TEM showed the presence of mesenchymal cells and adherensjunction. Conclusion: endoxifen treatments for eight weeks resulted inupregulation of EMT markers and changes in morphology of MCF-7 breast cancercells. The addition of curcumin did not prevent the activation of EMT.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.5.1243 PMCID: PMC6031844PMID: 29801408
