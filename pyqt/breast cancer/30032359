Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine,Nordwest Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.Our data demonstrate that tamoxifen does not reduce fracture risk. Closesurveillance is necessary to prevent bone loss in premenopausal women with breastcancer upon treatment initiation.INTRODUCTION: Endocrine treatment of breastcancer may interfere with bone turnover and influence fracture risk.METHODS: Out of a cohort of almost 5 million patients in total, we identified5520 women between 18 and 90 years of age with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen,matched them with 5520 healthy controls using the Disease Analyzer Database, and investigated the fracture risk.RESULTS: We found a cumulative incidence of fractures of 6.3% in patients agedbetween 18 and 50 years (n = 3634) treated with tamoxifen versus a cumulativeincidence of 3.6% in the control group (p < 0.001). As such, the risk of fracturewas 75% higher for patients receiving tamoxifen than that for healthy controls(HR 1.75; 95% CI 1.25-2.48). With regard to patients aged between 55 and 90 years(n = 7406), the cumulative incidence of fractures in patients treated withtamoxifen was 10.1% compared to 9.3% in the control group (p = 0.740), i.e.,there was no significant difference between the two groups (HR 0.97; 95% CI0.81-1.16).CONCLUSIONS: Compared to healthy controls, premenopausal women with breast cancertreated with tamoxifen showed an increased risk of fracture, while postmenopausalwomen on tamoxifen did not show any risk reduction.DOI: 10.1007/s00198-018-4642-2 PMID: 30032359
