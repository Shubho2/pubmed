There are multiplepolicy levers that may influence access to preventive services such as screening,including physician payment and managed care. We examine the relationship betweeneach of these factors and breast and cervical cancer screening among nonelderlynondisabled adult Medicaid enrollees. We combine individual-level data onMedicaid enrollment, demographics, and use of screening services from theMedicaid Analytic eXtract files with data on states' Medicaid-to-Medicare feeratios and estimate their impact on screening services. Higher physician fees areassociated with greater screening for comprehensive managed care enrollees; forenrollees in fee-for-service Medicaid, the findings are mixed. Patientparticipation in primary care case management is a significant moderator of therelationship between physician fees and the rate of screening, as interactionsbetween enrollee primary care case management status and the Medicaid fee ratioare consistently positive across models of screening.DOI: 10.1177/1077558718771123 PMID: 29726303
