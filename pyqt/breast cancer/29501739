Electronicaddress: cbe100@pitt.edu.The Exercise Program in Cancer and Cognition (EPICC) Study is a randomizedcontrolled trial designed to test the effects of moderate-intensity aerobicexercise on cognitive function in postmenopausal women with early-stage breastcancer during the first six months of aromatase inhibitor therapy. It isestimated that up to 75% of survivors of breast cancer experience cognitiveimpairment related to disease and treatment. At present, there are no knowninterventions to improve or manage cognitive function for women with breastcancer. Here, we describe a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial withallocation of 254 postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer to asupervised six-month aerobic exercise intervention or usual care. Prior tobeginning aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy, participants complete baselineassessments of cognitive function, cardiorespiratory fitness, blood-basedbiomarkers, physical activity and sleep, and symptoms (fatigue, sleep problems,depressive symptoms, anxiety). A random subset of participants (n = 150)undergoes neuroimaging procedures that include structural and functional magneticresonance imaging assessments. All participants maintain an activity diary;physical activity and sleep monitoring is repeated three and seven monthspost-randomization. The remaining baseline assessments are repeated seven months post-randomization. If successful, exercise could be a low-cost method to improvecognitive function in women with breast cancer that is easily adaptable to thehome or community.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.govNCT02793921.
