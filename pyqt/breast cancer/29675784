[Epub ahead of print]Isolation of Normal Fibroblasts and Their Cancer-Associated Counterparts (CAFs)for Biomedical Research.Dvořánková B(1), Lacina L(2), Smetana K Jr(1).Author information: (1)First Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Anatomy and BIOCEV, CharlesUniversity, Prague, Czech Republic.(2)First Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Anatomy and BIOCEV, CharlesUniversity, Prague, Czech Republic. lukas.lacina@lf1.cuni.cz.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent a crucial component of cancermicroenvironment. CAFs significantly influence biological properties of varioustypes of cancer in terms of local aggressiveness, recurrence, and metastaticbehaviour. This chapter summarizes a simple protocol for isolation of normalfibroblasts and their cancer-associated counterparts from normal human skin andmucosa, respectively, as well as from samples of human tumours such asbasal/squamous carcinoma, melanoma, and breast cancer, and employment of thisprocedure for other types of cancer is possible. Isolated fibroblasts can beexpanded in vitro and employed for further analysis of, e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, etc.DOI: 10.1007/7651_2018_137 PMID: 29675784
