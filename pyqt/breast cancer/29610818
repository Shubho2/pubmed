However, the biologicalfunction of ERβ in disease progression remains unclear. A highly ERβ-selectivefluorescent probe (FPNM) was discovered exhibiting nanomolar affinity for ERβwith an ERβ/ERα selectivity as high as 80, which allowed specific labeling ofintracellular ERβ. Moreover, distinct ERβ dynamics in various cellularbio-settings such as prostate cancer (DU-145) or triple-negative breast cancer(MDA-MB-231) cells were directly observed for the first time viaFPNM staining.DOI: 10.1039/c8cc00483h PMID: 29610818  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
