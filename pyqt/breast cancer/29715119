Cancertissue samples were obtained before and after treatment in 10 patients.Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine programmed death (PD)-1, CD8, andforkhead box P3 (FOXP3) expression by stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, andPD-ligand (L1) and PD-L2 expression by cancer cells.RESULTS: Of the 10 patients, 5 were responders (partial response) and 5 werenon-responders (stable disease, 2; progressive disease, 3) to eribulin. PD-1,PD-L2, and FOXP3 expression became negative in 5 patients, PD-L1 expressionbecame negative in 6 patients, and CD8 expression became positive in 3 patientsafter treatment. The response to eribulin was significantly associated with PD-L1and FOXP3 negative conversion (p=0.024 and 0.004, respectively). The change inE-cadherin expression (positive or negative) was also correlated with the changesin PD-L1 and FOXP3 (p=0.024 and 0.004, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank tests revealed that progression-free survival and time-to-treatmentfailure were significantly longer in patients with PD-L1 and FOXP3 negativeconversion (p=0.012 and 0.001; p=0.049 and 0.018, respectively).CONCLUSION: The efficacy of eribulin may be attributed to its biological effects on the immune system (reduction of PD-L1 and FOXP3 expression) throughepithelial-mesenchymal transition suppression, and vascular remodeling andimprovement of the tumor microenvironment.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12541 PMID: 29715119  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
