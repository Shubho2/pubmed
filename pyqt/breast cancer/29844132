[Epub ahead of print]Glycosyltransferase Gene Expression Identifies a Poor Prognostic ColorectalCancer Subtype Associated with Mismatch Repair Deficiency and Incomplete GlycanSynthesis.Noda M(1)(2), Okayama H(1), Tachibana K(2), Sakamoto W(1), Saito K(1), Thar MinAK(1), Ashizawa M(1), Nakajima T(1), Aoto K(1), Momma T(1), Katakura K(3), OhkiS(1), Kono K(1).Author information: (1)Department of Gastrointestinal Tract Surgery, Fukushima Medical UniversitySchool of Medicine, Fukushima City, Japan.(2)Department of Breast Surgery, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine,Fukushima City, Japan.(3)Department of Gastroenterology, Fukushima Medical University School ofMedicine, Fukushima City, Japan.Purpose: We aimed to discover glycosyltransferase gene (glycogene)-derivedmolecular subtypes of colorectal cancer associated with patientoutcomes.Experimental Design: Transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets of nontumor,precancerous, cancerous tissues, and cell lines with somatic mutations, mismatch repair status, clinicopathologic and survival information were assembled (n =4,223) and glycogene profiles were analyzed. IHC for a glycogene, GALNT6, wasconducted in adenoma and carcinoma specimens (n = 403). The functional role andcell surface glycan profiles were further investigated by in vitroloss-of-function assays and lectin microarray analysis.Results: We initiallydeveloped and validated a 15-glycogene signature that can identify apoor-prognostic subtype, which closely related to deficient mismatch repair(dMMR) and GALNT6 downregulation. The association of decreased GALNT6 with dMMRwas confirmed in multiple datasets of tumors and cell lines, and was furtherrecapitulated by IHC, where approximately 15% tumors exhibited loss of GALNT6protein. GALNT6 mRNA and protein was expressed in premalignant/preinvasivelesions but was subsequently downregulated in a subset of carcinomas, possiblythrough epigenetic silencing. Decreased GALNT6 was independently associated with poor prognosis in the IHC cohort and an additional microarray meta-cohort, bymultivariate analyses, and its discriminative power of survival was particularly remarkable in stage III patients. GALNT6 silencing in SW480 cells promotedinvasion, migration, chemoresistance, and increased cell surface expression of a cancer-associated truncated O-glycan, Tn-antigen.Conclusions: The 15-glycogenesignature and the expression levels of GALNT6 mRNA and protein each serve as anovel prognostic biomarker, highlighting the role of dysregulated glycogenes incancer-associated glycan synthesis and poor prognosis.
