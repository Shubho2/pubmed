CurrentWnt/β-catenin inhibitors, such as niclosamide, target the pathway nonspecificallyand exhibit poor pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in vivo. Niclosamide targetsother pathways, including mTOR, STAT3 and Notch. Novel benzimidazoles have beendeveloped to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling with greater specificity. Thecompounds SRI33576 and SRI35889 were discovered to produce more cytotoxicity inTNBC cell lines than in noncancerous cells. The agents also downregulatedWnt/β-catenin signaling mediators LRP6, cyclin D1, survivin and nuclear activeβ-catenin. In addition, SRI33576 did not affect mTOR, STAT3 and Notch signalingin TNBC and noncancerous cells. SRI35889 inhibited mTOR signaling less innoncancerous than in cancerous cells, while not affecting STAT3 and Notchpathways. Compounds SRI32529, SRI35357 and SRI35361 were not selectivelycytotoxic against TNBC cell lines compared to MCF10A cells. While SRI32529inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling, the compound also mitigated mTOR, STAT3 andNotch signaling. SRI33576 and SRI35889 were identified as cytotoxic and selectiveinhibitors of Wnt/β-catenin signaling with therapeutic potential to treat TNBC invivo.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19051524 PMCID: PMC5983770PMID: 29783777
