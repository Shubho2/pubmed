A better understanding of signaling pathways and downstream transcription factors and their targets mayidentify key molecules that can overcome antiestrogen resistance in breastcancer. An aberrant expression of miR-22 has been demonstrated in breast cancer; however, its contribution to breast cancer resistance to fulvestrant, anantiestrogen drug, remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated a moderateelevation in miR-22 expression in the 182R-6 fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer line we used as a model system, and this elevation was positively correlated withthe expression of the miRNA biogenesis enzymes AGO2 and Dicer. The level ofphosphorylated HER2/neu at Tyr877 was also upregulated in these cells, whereasthe level of RelA/p65 phosphorylated at Ser536 (p-p65) was downregulated.Knockdown of HER2/neu led to an induction of p-p65 and a reduction in miR-22levels. Luciferase assays identified two NF-κB binding motifs in the miR-22promoter that contributed to transcriptional repression of miR-22. Activation of RelA/p65, triggered by LPS, attenuated miR-22 expression, but this expression wasrestored by sc-514, a selective IKKβ inhibitor. Inhibition of miR-22 suppressedcell proliferation, induced apoptosis and caused cell cycle S-phase arrest,whereas enhancing expression of p21Cip1/Waf1 and p27Kip1. Surprisingly, ectopicexpression of miR-22 also suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis,caused S-phase arrest, and promoted the expression of p21Cip1/Waf1 and p27Kip1.Ectopic overexpression of miR-22 repressed the expression of FOXP1 and HDAC4,leading to a marked induction of acetylation of HDAC4 target histones.Conversely, inhibition of miR-22 promoted the expression of both FOXP1 and HDAC4,without the expected attenuation of histone acetylation. Instead, p53 acetylationat lysine 382 was unexpectedly upregulated. Taken together, our findingsdemonstrated, for the first time, that HER2 activation dephosphorylates RelA/p65 at Ser536. This dephosphoryalted p65 may be pivotal in transactivation of miR-22.Both increased and decreased miR-22 expression cause resensitization offulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cells to fulvestrant. HER2/NF-κB(p65)/miR-22/HDAC4/p21 and HER2/NF-κB (p65)/miR-22/Ac-p53/p21 signaling circuits may therefore confer this dual role on miR-22 through constitutivetransactivation of p21.DOI: 10.1038/s41389-018-0063-5 PMCID: PMC6064715PMID: 30057418
