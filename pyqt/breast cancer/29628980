In this study, we investigated thepharmacological mechanism of berberine (BBR) with respect to FN expression intriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells.Methods: The clinical significance of FN mRNA expression was analyzed using theKaplan-Meier plotter database (http://kmplot.com/breast). FN mRNA and proteinexpression levels were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction andwestern blotting, respectively.Results: Using publicly available clinical data, we observed that high FNexpression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. FN mRNA and protein expression was increased in TNBC cells compared with non-TNBCcells. As expected, recombinant human FN significantly induced cell spreading andadhesion in MDA-MB231 TNBC cells. We also investigated the regulatory mechanismunderlying FN expression. Basal levels of FN mRNA and protein expression weredownregulated by a specific activator protein-1 (AP-1) inhibitor, SR11302.Interestingly, FN expression in TNBC cells was dose-dependently decreased by BBR treatment. The level of c-Jun phosphorylation was also decreased by BBRtreatment.Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that FN expression is regulated via anAP-1-dependent mechanism, and that BBR suppresses FN expression in TNBC cellsthrough inhibition of AP-1 activity.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.1.21 PMCID: PMC5880962PMID: 29628980
