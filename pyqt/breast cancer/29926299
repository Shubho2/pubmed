They can used as initial compounds forsynthesis of several heterocyclic compounds. The compounds with the backbone ofchalcones have been reported to possess various biological activities.RESULTS: Pyridine and thioamide derivatives were obtained from the reaction of3-(furan-2-yl)-1-(p-tolyl)prop-2-en-1-one with the appropriate amount ofmalononitrile, benzoylacetonitrile, ethyl cyanoacetate and thiosemicarbazide inthe presence of ammonium acetate. The reaction of3,5-di(furan-2-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carbothioamide with ethyl2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, 3-chloropentane-2,4-dione or ethyl chloroacetateproduced thiazole derivatives. Pyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives were obtained aswell from thiazolone to arylidene malononitrile. The structures of the titlecompounds were clarified by elemental analyses, and FTIR, MS and NMR spectra.Some compounds were screened against various microorganisms (i.e., bacteria +ve, bacteria -ve and fungi). We observed that compounds (3a), (4a), (4d), (5), (7)and compound (8) exhibited high cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 cell line, withIC50 values of 23.6, 13.5, 15.1, 9.56, 14.2 and 23.5 μmol mL-1, respectively,while compound (9) was displayed the lowest values against MCF-7 cell lines.CONCLUSIONS: Efficient synthetic routes for some prepared pyridines, pyrazoline, thioamide, thiazoles and pyrano[2,3-d]thiazole were created. Moreover, selectednewly-synthesized products were evaluated for their antitumor activity againsttwo carcinoma cell lines: breast MCF-7 and colon HCT-116 human cancer cell lines.DOI: 10.1186/s13065-018-0439-9 PMCID: PMC6010368PMID: 29926299
