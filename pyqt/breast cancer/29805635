SDC exhibits biologicalsimilarity to prostate and breast cancers, therefore anti-hormone therapy andmolecular target therapies are available, however with limited beneficialeffects. Galanin and galanin receptors (GALRs) are well established as molecular biomarkers to predict the survival rate and risk of recurrence of head and necksquamous cell carcinoma. The present study investigated the clinicopathologicalfeatures of patients with SDC and the methylation status of their galanin andGALR genes to demonstrate the prognostic value for this disease. The medianoverall survival (OS) was 37.2 months. T-stage, N-stage, disease stage, tumorsize, and preoperative facial paralysis were significantly associated with OS,whereas human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression was not.GALR1 and GALR2 methylation rates in tumor tissues were significantly increasedcompared with normal tissues with 9.85- and 4.49-fold increase, respectively.p27kip1 and p57kip2 expression significantly inversely correlated with themethylation rate of GALR1 and GALR2. In addition, the observed GALR1 and/or GALR2methylation rates were significantly correlated with a decrease in OS. Theseresults suggest that GALR1 and GALR2 may serve as potential prognostic factorsand therapeutic targets in SDC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8525 PMCID: PMC5958682PMID: 29805635
