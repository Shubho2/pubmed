Mean cyclooxygenaseexpression (COX1 + COX2) ranked in the upper 99th percentile of all 20,531 genes and surprisingly, the mean expression of COX1 was more than tenfold higher thanCOX2. Highly significant correlations were observed between COX2 with eighttumor-promoting genes (EGR2, IL6, RGS2, B3GNT5, SGK1, SLC2A3, SFRP1 and ETS2) andbetween ALOX5 and ten tumor promoter genes (CD33, MYOF1, NLRP1, GAB3, CD4, IFR8, CYTH4, BTK, FGR, CD37). Expression of CYP19A1 (aromatase) was significantlycorrelated with COX2, but only in tumors positive for ER, PR and HER2.Tumor-promoting genes correlated with the expression of COX1, COX2, and ALOX5 areknown to effectively increase mitogenesis, mutagenesis, angiogenesis, cellsurvival, immunosuppression and metastasis in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10787-018-0489-6 PMID: 29736687
