Chemoresistanceremains to be a considerable obstacle in breast cancer therapy and it is ofteninvolves dysregulation of a variety of microRNAs (miRNAs). miR-485-5p functionsas a tumor suppressor in several types of human cancers. However, its role inbreast cancer chemosensitivity have not been determined. In the present study, wedemonstrated that overexpression of miR-485-5p suppresses breast cancerprogression and enhances chemosensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Furtherstudy demonstrated that miR-485-5p directly targeted the 3'-untranslated regionof survivin and overexpression of survivin overcomes the miR-485-5p inducedeffects on breast cancer. In conclusion, our study identified that miR-485-5psuppresses cancer progression and enhances the chemosensitivity by targetingsurvivin. Targeting survivin by miR-485-5p may provide a potential approach toreverse chemosensitivity in breast cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
