The trial failed to show a statistically significant differencebetween treatment arms. A robust translational program was established toinvestigate predictive biomarkers.Methods: A tissue microarray was retrospectively constructed using a subset ofpatient tissues (n = 4631) from the TEAM trial (n = 9766). Immunohistochemistrywas performed for biomarkers, classed into three groups: MAPK pathway, NF-kappa Bpathway, and estrogen receptor (ER) phosphorylation. Expression was analyzed for association with relapse-free survival (RFS) at 2.5 and 10 years and treatmentregimen using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank analysis. All statistical testswere two-sided.Results: In univariate analysis, ER167 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59 to 0.85, P < .001), IKKα (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.92, P = .005), Raf-1338 (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.80, P < .001), and p44/42MAPK202/204 (HR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.92, P = .004) were statisticallysignificantly associated with improved RFS at 10 years in patients receivingsequential therapy. Associations were strengthened when IKKα, Raf-1338, and ER167were combined into a cumulative prognostic score (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.52 to0.77, P < .001). Patients with an all negative IKKα, Raf-1338, and ER167 scorefavored exemestane monotherapy (odds ratio = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.90). Inmultivariable analysis, the IKKα, Raf-1338, and ER167 score (P = .001) was anindependent prognostic factor for RFS at 10 years in patients receivingsequential therapy.Conclusions: The IKKα, Raf-1338, and ER167 score is an independent predictivebiomarker for lower recurrence on sequential therapy. Negative expression mayfurther offer predictive value for exemestane monotherapy.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djx255 PMID: 29917140
