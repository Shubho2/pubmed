Weinvestigated the value of routine 2-field ("near" whole-body) SPET/CT applicationin breast cancer (BC) patients.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this prospective study planar WBS and 2-field SPET/CTwas performed in 257 consecutive BC patients referred for a bone scan. Whole bodyscan and SPET/CT were interpreted separately. Additional imaging studies andclinical follow-up for 30Â±24 months elucidated uncertain findings.RESULTS: Bone metastases were confirmed in 65 patients (25.3%). Sensitivity,specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive value per-patient was63.1%, 81.3%, 76.7%, 53.2% and 86.7% for WBS and 96.9%, 87.5%, 89.9%, 72.4% and98,8% for SPET/CT; differences were statistically significant except forspecificity. Respective values of sensitivity per-lesion were 47.6% and 98.9%(P<0.001). Eleven percent of true positive findings were noticed only in thelow-dose CT images, while 7% only in SPET. Single photon emission tomography/CTexhibited higher specificity than WBS in the spine (94.8% vs. 88.7%, P=0.04).Whole body scan interpretation changed after SPET/CT in 74 (28.8%) patients.Thirty-two patients with positive/suspicious WBS turned to be metastases-freeafter the interpretation of SPET/CT while 42 with unremarkable WBS turned to bepositive/suspicious. Of these cases, metastases were confirmed in one withnegative and 23 with positive/suspicious SPET/CT. The SPET/CT results promptedtreatment plan changes in 23 cases (8.9%).CONCLUSION: Whole-body bone SPET/CT scan outperformed WBS in terms ofsensitivity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive value and impacted onpatient management. Therefore, its use is recommended as a routine procedure inBC patients, even after a negative WBS.PMID: 30089314
