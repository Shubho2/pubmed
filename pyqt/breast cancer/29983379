As CESMtechnology keeps improving, a current meta-analysis review is needed tosystematically evaluate the potential diagnostic value of CESM.METHODS: A total of 18 studies were included in the review. Sensitivity,specificity, and other important parameters of CESM accuracy for breast cancerdiagnosis were pooled and analyzed using random-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated for overall accuracy estimation.RESULTS: The summary estimates for CESM in the diagnosis of breast cancer were asfollows: the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.89 (95% confidenceinterval [CI], 0.88-0.91) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.85), respectively. Positivelikelihood ratio was 3.73 (95% CI, 2.68-5.20), negative likelihood ratio was 0.10(95% CI, 0.06-0.15), and diagnostic odds ratio was 71.36 (95% CI, 36.28-140.39). The area under the curve was 0.96 (standard error = 0.011).CONCLUSION: CESM has a high diagnostic accuracy for evaluating breast cancer and can be considered as a useful test for initial assessment of breast lesions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
