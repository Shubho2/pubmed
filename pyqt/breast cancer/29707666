However, breast milk may be contaminated with variousmycotoxins. Ochratoxin A is one of the most important mycotoxins withnephrotoxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, genotoxic, and immunotoxic properties.Thus, we carried out this study to determine the concentration of ochratoxin A inhuman breast milk in Jiroft, Kerman Province, south of Iran.Materials and Methods: Eighty-four human breast milk samples were collected from mothers visiting the number one clinic in Jiroft city. Enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect ochratoxin A in the samples.Results: Ochratoxin A was found in all the tested samples at a concentrationranging from 0.11 to 7.34 ng/ml. The mean concentration of ochratoxin A in thesamples was 1.99±1.34 ng/ml. Fourteen samples contained ochratoxin A atconcentrations exceeding the quantitation limit (3 ng/ml).Conclusion: The results of this study showed that infants are exposed toochratoxin A in our region. In cases exceeding the quantitation limit, theinfant's body cannot detoxify the toxin. Therefore, the infant can be affected byvarious illnesses such as nephropathy, immune system deficiency, and differenttypes of cancer.DOI: 10.29252/cmm.3.3.1 PMCID: PMC5914919PMID: 29707666
