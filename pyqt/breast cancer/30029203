Electronic address: y.li@unsw.edu.au.Development of therapeutic resistance and metastasis is a major challenge withcurrent breast cancer (BC) therapy. Mounting evidence suggests that asubpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to the cancer therapeuticresistance and metastasis, leading to the recurrence and death in patients.Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are not only a consequence of mutations thatoveractivate the self-renewal ability of normal stem cells or committedprogenitors but also a result of the de-differentiation of cancer cells inducedby somatic mutations or microenvironmental components under treatment.Eradication of BCSCs may bring hope and relief to patients whose lives arethreatened by recurrent BCs. Therefore, a better understanding of the generation,regulatory mechanisms, and identification of CSCs in BC therapeutic resistanceand metastasis will be imperative for developing BCSC-targeted strategies. Herewe summarize the latest studies about cell surface markers and signallingpathways that sustain the stemness of BCSC and discuss the associations ofmechanisms behind these traits with phenotype and behavior changes in BCSCs. Moreimportantly, their implications for future study are also evaluated and potentialBCSC-targeted strategies are proposed to break through the limitation of current therapies.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
