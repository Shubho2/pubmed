Though diverse trials ofprobiotics had been continued in the treatment of diarrhea-IBS, only a few provedby randomized clinical trial. To prove the efficacy of Lactobacillus gasseriBNR17 isolated from breast milk in patients with diarrhea-IBS, prospective,randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial was done including healthrelated-quality of life analysis, colon transit time, and the changes of fecalmicrobiota. BNR17 significantly improved the symptoms of diarrhea compared tocontrol group. Health related-QOL analysis showed significant improvement ofabdominal pain, distension, disturbed daily life, and mean defecation frequencywith BNR17. On comparative CTT before and after BNR17, 6 out of 24 subjectsshowed significant correction of rapid colon transit pattern, while only 2 out of24 in placebo (p<0.01). Upon fecal microbiota analysis, BNR17 significantlyincreased B. fecalis, E. rectale, C. aerofaciens, F. prausnitzil and B. steroris.Conclusively, Lactobacillus gasseri BNR17 can be a potential probiotics toameliorate diarrhea-IBS.DOI: 10.3164/jcbn.17-73 PMCID: PMC5874236PMID: 29610559
