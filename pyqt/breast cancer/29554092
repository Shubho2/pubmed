However, the role of negativelymph nodes (LNs) remains unclear in breast cancer according to N substage (N1,N2, and N3). In this study, for the first time, we analyzed the prognosticsignificance of negative LNs in breast cancer patients. A critical relationshipwas observed between negative LN count and survival, independent of patientcharacteristics and other related molecular variables including estrogen receptor(PR) status, progesterone receptor (ER) status, human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 (HER2) status, depth of tumor invasion and degree of differentiation. This research is of great importance in providing more information about theprognosis of breast cancer by statistical analysis of negative lymph nodes andcan serve as a useful supplement to the current pathological system.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193784 PMCID: PMC5858777PMID: 29554092  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
