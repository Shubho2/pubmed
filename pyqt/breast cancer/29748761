We used Cox regression toquantify Hazard Ratios (HR) and corresponding confidence intervals (CI) foroverall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in models that includedadjustment for breast cancer intrinsic subtype. Of 302 genes in our discoveryanalysis, 22 were further evaluated in relation to OS among 134 TNBC cases fromthe Nashville Breast Health Study and the Southern Community Cohort Study; 16genes were further evaluated in relation to DFS in 335 TNBC cases from four gene expression omnibus datasets. Fixed-effect meta-analysis was used to combineresults across data sources.RESULTS: Twofold higher expression of EOMES (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97), RASGRP1 (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.97), and SOD2 (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.96) was associated with better OS. Twofold higher expression of EOMES (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.97)and RASGRP1 (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.95) was also associated with better DFS. Onthe contrary, a doubling of FA2H (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06-1.22) and GSPT1 (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.14-1.55) expression was associated with shorter DFS.CONCLUSIONS: We identified five genes (EOMES, FA2H, GSPT1, RASGRP1, and SOD2)that may serve as potential prognostic biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for TNBC.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4816-9 PMID: 29748761
