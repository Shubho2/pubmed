Although CYP1B1 might play a crucial role in carcinogenesis, the detailedmolecular mechanisms underlying oncogenic involvement in cancer developmentremain unclear. The present study investigated the manner in which CYP1B1promotes survival of various cancer cells. Treatment with2,2',4,6'-tetramethoxystilbene (TMS), a specific CYP1B1 inhibitor, significantly inhibited cell viability in human breast cancer and leukemia cell lines,including MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, HL-60, and U937 cells. In order to characterize the cellular functions of CYP1B1 associated with cancer cell survival, therelationship between this oncogene and death receptor 4 (DR4) was determined.Following induction or inhibition of CYP1B1, mRNA and protein expression levelsof DR4 were measured, and this oncogene was found to significantly repress DR4mRNA and protein expression. Further, the suppression of DR4 by CYP1B1 wasrestored with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a DNA methyltransferaseinhibitor, indicating that DNA methylation may be involved in CYP1B1-mediated DR4inhibition. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inCYP1B1-overexpressed HL-60 cells revealed that this oncogene inducedhypermethylation on DR4 promoter. Interestingly, data showed that DR4 suppressionof CYP1B1 is mediated by the DNA-binding ability of specificity protein 1 (Sp1). These findings suggest that CYP1B1 promotes cancer cell survival throughinvolvement of DNA methylation-mediated DR4 inhibition and that Sp1 may act askey mediator required for oncogenic action.DOI: 10.1080/15287394.2018.1440186 PMID: 29473798
