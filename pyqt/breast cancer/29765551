In particular, activating mutations of PIK3CA(~45%) are frequently found in luminal A BrCa samples. Genomic studies haveuncovered inactivating mutations in MAP3K1 (13-20%) and MAP2K4 (~8%), twoupstream kinases of the JNK apoptotic pathway in luminal A BrCa samples. Further,simultaneous mutation of PIK3CA and MAP3K1 are found in ~11% of mutant PIK3CAtumors. How these two alterations may cooperate to elicit tumorigenesis andimpact the sensitivity to PI3K and AKT inhibitors is currently unknown. UsingCRISPR gene editing we have genetically disrupted MAP3K1 expression in mutantPIK3CA cell lines to specifically create in vitro models reflecting themutational status of PIK3CA and MAP3K1 in BrCa patients. MAP3K1 deficient celllines exhibited ~2.4-fold increased proliferation rate and decreased sensitivity to PI3Kα/δ(AZD8835) and AKT (AZD5363) inhibitors (~2.61 and ~5.23-fold IC50increases, respectively) compared with parental control cell lines. In addition, mechanistic analysis revealed that MAP3K1 disruption enhances AKT phosphorylationand downstream signaling and reduces sensitivity to AZD5363-mediated pathwayinhibition. This appears to be a consequence of deficient MAP3K1-JNK signalingincreasing IRS1 stability and therefore promoting IRS1 binding to p85, resulting in enhanced PI3Kα activity. Using 3D-MCF10A-PI3KαH1047R models, we found thatMAP3K1 depletion increased overall acinar volume and counteractedAZD5363-mediated reduction of acinar growth due to enhanced proliferation andreduced apoptosis. Furthermore, in vivo efficacy studies revealed thatMAP3K1-deficient MCF7 tumors were less sensitive to AKT inhibitor treatment,compared with parental MCF7 tumors. Our study provides mechanistic and in vivoevidence indicating a role for MAP3K1 as a tumor suppressor gene at least in the context of PIK3CA-mutant backgrounds. Further, our work predicts that MAP3K1mutational status may be considered as a predictive biomarker for efficacy inPI3K pathway inhibitor trials.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25118 PMCID: PMC5940413PMID: 29765551
