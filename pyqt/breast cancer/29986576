We investigated the association between diabetes medication use andcancer survival.Materials and Methods: The current study includes 633 breast, 890 colorectal, 824lung, and 543 gastric cancer cases identified from participants of twopopulation-based cohort studies in Shanghai. Information on diabetes medicationuse was obtained by linking to electronic medical records. The associationsbetween diabetes medication use (metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin) andoverall and cancer-specific survival were evaluated using time-dependent Coxproportional hazards models.Results: After adjustment for clinical characteristics and treatment factors, useof metformin was associated with better overall survival among colorectal cancer patients (hazards ratio [HR], 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34 to 0.88)and for all four types of cancer combined (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.98). Ever use of insulin was associated with worse survival for all cancer types combined(HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.57 to 2.29) and for the four cancer types individually.Similar associations were seen for diabetic patients. Sulfonylureas use wasassociated with worse overall survival for breast or gastric cancer (HR, 2.87;95% CI, 1.22 to 6.80 and HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.84, respectively) amongdiabetic patients. Similar association patterns were observed between diabetesmedication use and cancer-specific survival.Conclusion: Metformin was associated with improved survival among colorectalcancer cases, while insulin use was associated with worse survival among patientsof four major cancers. Further investigation on the topic is needed given thepotential translational impact of these findings.DOI: 10.4143/crt.2017.591 PMID: 29986576
