Cell populations with heterogeneous genetic makeup,such as those of infectious microbial organisms or cancer, rely on their inherentrobustness to maintain viability and fitness, but when encountering environmentalinsults, such as drug treatment, these populations are also poised for rapidadaptation through evolutionary selection. In this study, we develop a generalmathematical model that allows us to explain and quantify this fundamentalrelationship between robustness and evolvability of heterogeneous cellpopulations. Our model predicts that robustness is, in fact, essential forevolvability, especially for more adverse environments, a trend we observe inaneuploid budding yeast and breast cancer cells. Robustness also compensates for the negative impact of the systems' complexity on their evolvability. Our modelalso provides a mathematical means to estimate the number of independentprocesses underlying a system's performance and identify the most generallyadapted subpopulation, which may resemble the multi-drug-resistant "persister"cells observed in cancer.DOI: 10.1091/mbc.E18-01-0070 PMCID: PMC5994894 [Available on 2018-08-16]PMID: 29851566
