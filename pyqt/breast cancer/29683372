[Epub ahead ofprint]Modulating the expression of Chtop, a versatile regulator of gene-specifictranscription and mRNA export.Izumikawa K(1), Ishikawa H(1), Simpson RJ(2)(3), Takahashi N(1)(2).Author information: (1)a Department of Applied Biological Science , United Graduate School ofAgriculture, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology , Fuchu , Tokyo ,Japan.(2)b Global Innovation Research Organizations, Tokyo University of Agricultureand Technology , Fuchu , Tokyo , Japan.(3)c La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science (LIMS) LIMS Building 1, Room 412 LaTrobe University , Bundoora Victoria , Australia.Chtop binds competitively to the arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 and PRMT5,thereby promoting the asymmetric or symmetric methylation of arginine residues,respectively. In cooperation with PRMT1, Chtop activates transcription of certaingene groups, such as the estrogen-inducible genes in breast cancer cells, the5-hydroxymethylcytosine-modified genes involved in glioblastomagenesis, or theZbp-89-dependent genes in erythroleukemia cells. Chtop also represses expression of the fetal Î³-globin gene. In addition, Chtop is a component of the TREX complexthat links transcription elongation to mRNA export. The regulation of Chtopexpression is, therefore, a key process during the expression of certain genegroups and pathogenesis of certain diseases. Our recent study revealed thatcellular levels of Chtop are strictly autoregulated by a mechanism involvingintron retention and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Here, we summarize roles ofChtop in gene-specific expression and highlight our recent findings concerningthe autoregulation of Chtop.DOI: 10.1080/15476286.2018.1465795 PMID: 29683372
