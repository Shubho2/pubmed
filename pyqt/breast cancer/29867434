Since localrecurrence is common and associated with morbidity, case series have reported on the use of adjuvant radiotherapy. Radiotherapy treatment setup for malignanciesof the penis can be challenging because of variability in anatomic positioning.This variability can lead to lack of reproducibility. We propose a novel externalbeam radiotherapy technique for the treatment of UC: prone positioning. Thistechnique has been used to treat breast cancers successfully and can be used totreat any variety of penile malignancies. We present 2 patients who were treated using this positioning.DOI: 10.1159/000488935 PMCID: PMC5981624PMID: 29867434
