Many studies have revealed the WBP2 gene as a high-risk gene forleukoariaosis and cerebral white matter lesions is important in the pathologicstage of glioma development. This study aimed to illustrate the underlyingmechanism by which WBP2 regulates the process of glioma development. Theexpression pattern of WBP2 in several tumor cells was determined, clarifying the carcinogenic action of WBP2 in glioma cells. Overexpression of WBP2 in gliomacells promoted cell proliferation and migration, and the number of S-phase cells,whereas the depletion of WBP2 by RNAi-mediated knockdown restrained cell growthand cell cycle progression. Upregulation of WBP2 significantly enhanced thetumorigenic ability of U251 cells in vivo. MS/GST pulldown assay identifiedÎ±-enolase (ENO1) and Homer protein homolog 3 (Homer3) as novel potent interactionpartners of WBP2. Knockdown of ENO1 or Homer3 allowed cell growth and migrationto return to normal levels. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo experimentsindicated that the oncogenic role of WBP2 in glioma was through modulating ENO1and glycolysis activity via the ENO1-PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Collectively,these results reveal that WBP2 plays a vital role in the occurrence anddevelopment of glioma, indicating a target gene for glioblastoma treatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0376-5 PMCID: PMC5832848PMID: 29497031
