However, the therapeutic effects of HER2-inhibitor monotherapyare not always clinically effective compared to its co-treatment withchemotherapy. Therefore, it has become pivotal to predict the therapeuticefficacy of trastuzumab monotherapy prior to administration. Recently,carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEACAM6) has beenreported to be a HER2-related factor. The aim of the present study was to explorethe therapeutic mechanism of trastuzumab including the relevance of CEACAM6expression. CEACAM6 and HER2 double-positive human breast carcinoma cell linesBT-474, HCC-1419, and MDA-MB-361 were used in this study. CEACAM6 knockdowndecreased the inhibitory effects of trastuzumab in the trastuzumab-sensitiveBT-474 and HCC-1419, but not in the trastuzumab-resistant MDA-MB-361 cells. Weexamined the interaction between CEACAM6 and HER2 using a proximity ligationassay (PLA). The interaction was detected in BT-474 and HCC-1419, but not inMDA-MB-361 and was significantly associated with in vitro trastuzumab therapeuticsensitivity. We further analysed the status of CEACAM6 and HER2 and theirinteraction in archival pathology specimens also using PLA. The interaction wasdetected only in CEACAM6 and HER2 double-positive breast cancer cases and theirPLA score was significantly associated with efficacy of trastuzumab treatment.Therefore, the evaluation of the CEACAM6/HER2 interaction could serve as a markerto predict the efficacy of trastuzumab monotherapy in breast cancer patients.This article is protected by copyright.
