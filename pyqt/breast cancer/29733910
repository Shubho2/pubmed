Electronicaddress: shaikh.rahman@ttu.edu.Breast cancer​ is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women.Accumulating evidence suggests that cholesterol plays an important role in thedevelopment of breast cancer. Even though the mechanistic link between these two factors is not well understood, one possibility is that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism may affect lipid raft and membrane fluidity and can promote tumordevelopment. Current studies have shown oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC)as a critical regulator of cholesterol and breast cancer pathogenesis. This issupported by the significantly higher expression of CYP27A1 (cytochrome P450,family 27, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) in breast cancers. This enzyme isresponsible for 27-HC synthesis from cholesterol. It has been shown that 27-HCcan not only increase the proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breastcancer cells but also stimulate tumor growth and metastasis in several breastcancer models. This phenomenon is surprising since 27-HC and other oxysterolsgenerally reduce intracellular cholesterol levels by activating the liver Xreceptors (LXRs). Resolving this paradox will elucidate molecular pathways bywhich cholesterol, ER, and LXR are connected to breast cancer. These findingswill also provide the rationale for evaluating pharmaceutical approaches thatmanipulate cholesterol or 27-HC synthesis in order to mitigate the impact ofcholesterol on breast cancer pathophysiology. In addition to cholesterol,epigenetic changes including non-coding RNAs, and microRNAs, DNA methylation, andhistone modifications, have all been shown to control tumorigenesis. The purpose of this review is to discuss the link between altered cholesterol metabolism and epigenetic modification during breast cancer progression.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
