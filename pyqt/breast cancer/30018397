Using28 inflammatory-related proteins collected from prospective blood samples fromtwo case-control studies nested in the Italian component of the EuropeanProspective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (n = 261) and in the NorthernSweden Health and Disease Study (n = 402), we tested the hypothesis that aninflammatory score is associated with breast cancer (BC) and Β-cell Non-HodgkinLymphoma (B-cell NHL, including 68 multiple myeloma cases) onset. We modelled therelationship between this inflammatory score and the two cancers studied: (BC andB-cell NHL) using generalised linear models, and assessed, through adjustmentsthe role of behaviours and lifestyle factors. Analyses were performed by cancertypes pooling both populations, and stratified by cohorts, and time to diagnosis.Our results suggested a lower inflammatory score in B-cell NHL cases (β = -1.28, p = 0.012), and, to lesser, extent with BC (β = -0.96, p = 0.33) compared tocontrols, mainly driven by cancer cases diagnosed less than 6 years afterenrolment. These associations were not affected by subsequent adjustments forpotential intermediate confounders, notably behaviours. Sensitivity analysesindicated that our findings were not affected by the way the inflammatory scorewas calculated. These observations call for further studies involving largerpopulations, larger variety of cancer types and repeated measures of larger panelof inflammatory markers.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29041-1 PMCID: PMC6050323PMID: 30018397
