A retrospective analysis was performed for women with oestrogen receptor(ER)-positive disease, using statistical modelling to show the effect oftreatment (surgery or primary endocrine therapy) and age and health status onBCSS. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation.RESULTS: Cancer registration data on 23 961 women were retrieved. After datapreprocessing, 18 730 of 23 849 women (78·5 per cent) were identified as havingER-positive disease; of these, 10 087 (53·9 per cent) had surgery and 8643 (46·1 per cent) had primary endocrine therapy. BCSS was worse in the primary endocrine therapy group than in the surgical group (5-year BCSS rate 69·4 and 89·9 per centrespectively). This was true for all strata considered, although the differencewas less in the cohort with the greatest degree of co-morbidity. For older,frailer patients the hazard of breast cancer death had less relative impact onoverall survival.CONCLUSION: BCSS in older women with ER-positive disease is worse if surgery isomitted. This treatment choice may contribute to inferior cancer outcomes.Selection for surgery on the basis of predicted life expectancy may permit choiceof women for whom surgery confers little benefit.© 2018 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/bjs.10885 PMID: 29790154
