Microfibrillar-associated protein 5 (MFAP5) is a component of extracellularelastic microfibril which has been confirmed to function in tissue developmentand cancer progression. But the role of MFAP5 in breast cancer remains unclear.The present study demonstrated that MFAP5 was up-regulated in breast cancerscompared with that in normal breast tissues, and further increased in breastcancer bone metastasis. Functionally, MFAP5 overexpression accelerated breastcancer cell proliferation and migration, while an opposite effect was observedwhen MFAP5 was knocked down. In addition, up-regulation of MFAP5 increased theexpression of MMP2 and MMP9 and activated the ERK signaling pathway. Conversely, inhibition of MFAP5 suppressed the expression of MMP2, MMP9, p-FAK, p-Erk1/2 and p-cJun. These findings may provide a better understanding about the mechanism of breast cancer and suggest that MFAP5 may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for breast cancer, especially for bone metastasis of breastcancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
