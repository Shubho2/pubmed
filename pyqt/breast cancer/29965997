This study reanalyzed existing data from three genome-wide associationstudies (GWAS) using a novel computational biostatistics approach (muGWAS), whichhad been validated in studies of 600-2000 subjects in epilepsy and autism. MuGWASjointly analyzes several neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms whileincorporating knowledge about genetics of heritable diseases into the statisticalmethod and about GWAS into the rules for determining adaptive genome-widesignificance. Results from three independent GWAS of 1000-2000 subjects each,which were made available under the National Institute of Health's "Up For AChallenge" (U4C) project, not only confirmed cell-cycle control and receptor/AKT signaling, but, for the first time in breast cancer GWAS, also consistentlyidentified many genes involved in endo-/exocytosis (EEC), most of which hadalready been observed in functional and expression studies of breast cancer. Inparticular, the findings include genes that translocate (ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ANO4,ABCA1) and metabolize (AGPAT3, AGPAT4, DGKQ, LPPR1) phospholipids entering thephosphatidylinositol cycle, which controls EEC. These novel findings suggestscavenging phospholipids as a novel intervention to control local spread ofcancer, packaging of exosomes (which prepare distant microenvironment fororgan-specific metastases), and endocytosis of β1 integrins (which are requiredfor spread of metastatic phenotype and mesenchymal migration of tumor cells).Beta-cyclodextrins (βCD) have already been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal studies of breast cancer, but exhibits cholesterol-related ototoxicity.The smaller alpha-cyclodextrins (αCD) also scavenges phospholipids, but cannotfit cholesterol. An in-vitro study presented here confirms hydroxypropyl (HP)-αCDto be twice as effective as HPβCD against migration of human cells of bothreceptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. If the previoussuccessful animal studies with βCDs are replicated with the safer and moreeffective αCDs, clinical trials of adjuvant treatment with αCDs are warranted.Ultimately, all breast cancer are expected to benefit from treatment with HPαCD, but women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) will benefit most, becausethey have fewer treatment options and their cancer advances more aggressively.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199012 PMCID: PMC6028090PMID: 29965997
