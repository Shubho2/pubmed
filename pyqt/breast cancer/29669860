In addition to G1 cell cycle arrest, palbociclibtreatment results in cell senescence, a phenotype that is not readily explainedby CDK4/6 inhibition. In order to identify a molecular mechanism responsible for palbociclib-induced senescence, we performed thermal proteome profiling of MCF7breast cancer cells. In addition to affecting known CDK4/6 targets, palbociclibinduces a thermal stabilization of the 20S proteasome, despite not directlybinding to it. We further show that palbociclib treatment increases proteasomeactivity independently of the ubiquitin pathway. This leads to cellularsenescence, which can be counteracted by proteasome inhibitors.Palbociclib-induced proteasome activation and senescence is mediated by reducedproteasomal association of ECM29. Loss of ECM29 activates the proteasome, blocks cell proliferation, and induces a senescence-like phenotype. Finally, we findthat ECM29 mRNA levels are predictive of relapse-free survival in breast cancerpatients treated with endocrine therapy. In conclusion, thermal proteomeprofiling identifies the proteasome and ECM29 protein as mediators of palbociclibactivity in breast cancer cells.© 2018 The Authors.
