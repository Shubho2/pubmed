Current clinical questions include how tochoose among these agents and how to sequence them with other therapies. Areas ofactive inquiry include identifying predictive biomarkers for CDK4/6 inhibitors,deciding whether to continue CDK4/6 inhibitors after disease progression,creating novel treatment combinations, and expanding use beyond HR+/HER2-advanced breast cancer. Here, we review the current use of and potential nextdirections for CDK4/6 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with HR+ breastcancer.PMID: 29847850  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
