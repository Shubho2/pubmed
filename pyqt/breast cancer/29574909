Here, we evaluated prediagnostic serum concentrations offerritin, iron and transferrin as well as transferrin saturation (TSAT) inrelation to cancer risk and mortality in a prospective study by multivariable Coxregression analyses. A case-cohort sample of the population-based EPIC-HeidelbergStudy including a random subcohort (n = 2738) and incident cases of breast cancer(n = 627), prostate cancer (n = 554), lung cancer (n = 195), colorectal cancer(n = 256) and cancer death (n = 759) was used. Ferritin levels were inverselyassociated with breast cancer risk in the multivariable Cox regression model,with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67 [95% confidence interval: 0.49, 0.92] for women in the highest quartile compared to those in the lowest quartile. Neitherferritin nor the other markers of iron status were significantly associated with colorectal, prostate or lung cancer risk. An inverse association was observedbetween ferritin and total cancer mortality (HR: 0.70 [0.53, 0.92]). There wereno significant overall associations between serum iron, transferrin or TSAT andcancer mortality. The present findings do not support the notion of increasediron load constituting a cancer risk factor in the general population. Bycontrast, our analyses revealed inverse associations between ferritin levels and breast cancer risk as well as cancer mortality.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31384 PMID: 29574909
