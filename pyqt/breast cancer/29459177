Electronicaddress: mmostafa@sci.cu.edu.eg.Pro-carboxypeptidase B2 (pro-CPB2) or thrombin-activatable ﬁbrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a glycoprotein encoded by the CPB2 gene and deregulated in severalcancer types, including breast cancer. Thrombin binding to thrombomodulin (TM),encoded by THBD, is important for TAFI activation. CPB2 gene expression isinfluenced by genetic polymorphism and cytokines such as interleukin 10 (IL-10). Our previous results showed that tumor infiltrating monocytes/macrophages(CD14+/CD16+) isolated from inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) patients' secretehigh levels of IL-10. The aim of the present study is to test geneticpolymorphism and expression of CPB2 in healthy breast tissues and carcinomatissues of non-IBC and IBC patients. Furthermore, to investigate whether IL-10modulates the expression of CPB2 and THBD in vivo and in-vitro. We tested CPB2Thr325Ile polymorphism using restriction fragment length polymorphism, (RFLP)technique in healthy and carcinoma breast tissues. The mRNA expression of CPB2,THBD and IL10 were assessed by RT-qPCR. Infiltration of CD14+ cells was assessed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, we investigated the correlation betweeninfiltration of CD14+ cells and expression of IL10 and CPB2. Furthermore, wecorrelated IL10 expression with the expression of both CPB2 and THBD in breastcarcinoma tissues. Finally, we validated the role of recombinant IL-10 inregulating the expression of CPB2 and THBD using different breast cancer celllines. Our results showed that CPB2 genotypes carrying the high-risk allele[Thr/Ile (CT) and Ile/Ile (TT)] were more frequent in both IBC and non-IBCpatients compared to control group. CPB2 genotypes did not show any statisticalcorrelation with CPB2 mRNA expression levels or patients' clinical pathologicalproperties. Interestingly, CPB2 and IL10 expression were significantly higher andpositively correlated with the incidence of CD14+ cells in carcinoma tissues ofIBC as compared to non-IBC. On the other hand, THBD expression was significantly lower in IBC carcinoma versus non-IBC tissues. Based on molecular subtypes, CPB2 and IL10 expression were significantly higher in triple negative (TN) as comparedto hormonal positive (HP) carcinoma tissues of IBC. Moreover, CPB2 expression waspositively correlated with presence of lymphovascular invasion and the expressionof IL10 in carcinoma tissues of IBC patients. Furthermore, recombinant humanIL-10 stimulated CPB2 expression in SUM-149 (IBC cell line) but not in MDA-MB-231(non-IBC cell line), while there was no significant effect THBD expression. Inconclusion, carcinoma tissues of IBC patients are characterized by higherexpression of CPB2 and lower expression of THBD. Moreover, CPB2 positivelycorrelates with IL10 mRNA expression, incidence of CD14+ cells and lymphovascularinvasion in IBC patients. IL-10 stimulated CPB2 expression in TN-IBC cell linesuggests a relevant role of CPB2 in the aggressive phenotype of IBC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
