Currently, no therapeutical indication led to approval of its 17-hydroxylated analog 4-hydroxytestosterone, an anabolic steroid. However,it is currently investigated in a clinical trial for breast cancer. In contextwith sports doping, aromatase inhibitors are administered to reduce estrogenicside effects of misused anabolic substances or their metabolites. Therefore, bothsubstances are prohibited in sports by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).Analysis of urinary phase I and phase II metabolites showed similar results forboth compounds. In the current investigation, 4-hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione, 4-hydroxytestosterone and seven of their described urinary metabolites as well as2α-hydroxyandrostenedione were tested in the yeast androgen screen and the yeast estrogen screen. Androgenic effects were observed for all tested substances,except for one, which showed anti-androgenic properties. With regard to the yeastestrogen screen, estrogenic effects were observed for only two metabolites atrather high concentrations, while six out of the ten substances tested showedanti-estrogenic properties. In terms of the strong androgenic effect observed for4-hydroxytestosterone (10-8 M), 4-hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione (10-8 M) andtwo more urinary metabolites, the yeast androgen assay may also be used to trace abuse in urine samples.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
