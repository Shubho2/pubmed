However, next to psychosocial problems, it is equally important to identify distress caused by limitations in physical functioning. Validity of the DT&PL for the identificationof physical problems in BCSs has not yet been investigated. Therefore, thepurpose of the present study is to investigate the concurrent validity andpsychometric properties of the Dutch DT&PL in BCSs for the identification ofphysical problems. Ninenty BCSs completed the DT&PL, ShortForm-36 (SF-36) and theDutch Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH). Forty-seven % of BCSs reported a high level of distress on the DT&PL (score ≥5). DistressedBCS showed increased physical and emotional problems and problems at the upperlimb region. The scores obtained with the DT&PL correlated weakly to stronglywith subscales for physical functioning of the SF-36 (r = -0.224 to r = -0.676;p < 0.05) and with limitations in physical functioning at the upper limb region(DASH; r = 0.380 to r = 0.619; p < 0.01). In conclusion, the Dutch DT&PL is amultidimensional instrument showing good concurrent validity for the screening ofphysical problems.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ecc.12880 PMID: 30039890
