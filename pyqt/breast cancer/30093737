This arises in the context of self-reportedfamily history, a time to event predictor often measured with error, used inMendelian risk prediction models. Using validation data, we propose a method toadjust for this type of error. We estimate the measurement error process using a nonparametric smoothed Kaplan-Meier estimator, and use Monte Carlo integration toimplement the adjustment. We apply our method to simulated data in the context ofboth Mendelian and multivariate survival prediction models. Simulations areevaluated using measures of mean squared error of prediction (MSEP), area underthe response operating characteristics curve (ROC-AUC), and the ratio of observedto expected number of events. These results show that our method mitigates theeffects of measurement error mainly by improving calibration and total accuracy. We illustrate our method in the context of Mendelian risk prediction modelsfocusing on misreporting of breast cancer, fitting the measurement error model ondata from the University of California at Irvine, and applying our method tocounselees from the Cancer Genetics Network. We show that our method improvesoverall calibration, especially in low risk deciles.DOI: 10.1080/01621459.2017.1311261 PMCID: PMC6077989 [Available on 2019-01-01]PMID: 30093737
