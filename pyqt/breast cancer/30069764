Dysregulated Hh signaling results inuncontrolled proliferation in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and has also been found present in medulloblastoma, and many other cancers such as those ofgastrointestinal tract, brain, lung, breast, and prostate. In January 2012,vismodegib became the first agent to target the Hh pathway to receive approval bythe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in July 2013 approval bythe European Medicines Agency (EMA) followed for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic metastatic BCC, or locally advanced BCC inappropriate forsurgery or radiotherapy. The role of vismodegib in other malignancies than BCChas still to be investigated.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-91442-8_9 PMID: 30069764
