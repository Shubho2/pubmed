Anti-PD-L1 immune therapy has beenapproved for the treatment of several advanced human cancers. Therefore, further understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 is critical to improvePD-L1-targeting immunotherapy. Recent studies indicated that contact-dependentpathways may regulate anticancer immunity, highlighting the importance of cellcontact-induced signaling in cancer immunity. Here, we show that tumor cellcontact upregulates PD-L1 expression and reduces T-cell-mediated cell killingthrough the membrane receptor tyrosine kinase ephrin receptor A10 (EphA10), whichis not expressed in normal tissues except testis and is known to mediate cellcontact-dependent juxtacrine signaling. Knockout of EphA10 in tumor cellsincreased T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity in syngeneic mouse models. EphA10expression also correlated positively with PD-L1 in human breast tumor tissues.Together, our data reveal that in addition to paracrine/autocrine signaling, cellcontact-mediated juxtacrine signaling also promotes PD-L1 expression, implyingthat tumor cells may escape immune surveillance via this mechanism and thattargeting EphA10 to boost antitumor immunity may be a new immune checkpointblockade strategy for female patients with breast cancer.Significance: Regulationof PD-L1 expression by cell contact-mediated signaling promotes immune escape in breast cancer and may lead to the development of an immunotherapy with lessadverse effects in female patients.
