Selective visualization of individual protease activitywithin a complex proteome is of major importance to establish their roles in bothnormal and tumor cells, thereby facilitating our understanding of the regulation of proteolytic networks. A generally accepted means to monitor protease activity is the use of small molecule substrates and activity-based probes. However, thereare eleven human cysteine cathepsins, with a few of them displaying overlappingsubstrate specificity, making the development of small molecules that selectivelytarget a single cathepsin very challenging. Here, we utilized HyCoSuL, apositional scanning substrate approach, to develop a highly-selective fluorogenicsubstrate and activity-based probe for monitoring cathepsin L activity in thebreast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Use of this probe enabled us to distinguishthe activity of cathepsin L from that of other cathepsins, particularly cathepsinB, which is abundant and ubiquitously expressed in normal and transformed celltypes. We found that cathepsin L localization in MDA-MB-231 cells greatlyoverlaps with that of cathepsin B, however, several cathepsin L-rich lysosomeslacked cathepsin B activity. Overall, these studies demonstrate thatHyCoSuL-derived small molecule probes are valuable tools to image cathepsin Lactivity in living cells. This approach thus enables evaluation of cathepsin Lfunction in tumorigenesis and is applicable to other cysteine cathepsins.DOI: 10.1039/c7sc04303a PMCID: PMC5896380PMID: 29719685
