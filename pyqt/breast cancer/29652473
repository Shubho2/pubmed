Toaddress these problems, we report a self-assembled pentalysine-phthalocyanineassembly nanodots (PPAN) fabricated by an amphipathic photosensitizer-peptideconjugate. We triggered the photodynamic therapy effects of photosensitizers byprecisely controlling the assembly and disintegration of the nanodots. Inphysiological aqueous conditions, PPAN exhibited a size-tunable sphericalconformation with a highly positive shell of the polypeptides and a hydrophobiccore of the Ï€-stacking Pc moieties. The assembly conformation suppressed thefluorescence and the reactive oxygen species generation of the monomericphotosensitizer molecules (mono-Pc) and thus declined the photobleaching andoff-target photodynamic effects. However, tumor cells disintegrated PPAN andreleased the mono-Pc molecules, which exhibited fluorescence for detection andthe photodynamic effects for the elimination of the tumor tissues. The molecular dynamics simulations revealed the various assembly configurations of PPAN andillustrated the assembly mechanism. At the cellular level, PPAN exhibited aremarkable phototoxicity to breast cancer cells with the IC50 values in a lownanomolar range. By using the subcutaneous and orthotopic breast cancer animalmodels, we also demonstrated the excellent antitumor efficacies of PPAN in vivo.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b19058 PMID: 29652473
