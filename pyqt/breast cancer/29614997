One of the few established instruments for evaluatingwhether sufficient information has been provided, is the EORTC QLQ-INFO25questionnaire which was developed to measure how patients perceive information.The aim of this study was to investigate whether cancer patients' level ofknowledge about their disease and treatment was associated with their perception of and satisfaction with the information.METHODS: Breast cancer patients referred for adjuvant chemotherapy and prostatecancer patients referred for curative radiotherapy were included. Level ofknowledge about their disease and treatment was measured using study-specificquestionnaires. Patients' perception of and satisfaction with the receivedinformation was assessed using EORTC QLQ-INFO25. Assessments were done before thefirst consultation with an oncologist (T1), after the consultation (T2) and8 weeks after start of treatment (T3).RESULTS: Ninety eight patients were enrolled. Patients with higher education,daily Internet access and in paid employment had the highest baseline knowledgescores. The mean knowledge score increased significantly (T1: 16.4; T2: 20.8; T3:21.3; p < 0.001.). During the same period, the patients reported on the INFO25 a significant, positive increase in how much information they had received, andthat they were more satisfied with the information.CONCLUSIONS: Patients' knowledge increased significantly during the study period,and they reported that they felt better informed and were more satisfied with theinformation, suggesting that EORTC QLQ-INFO25 might be used to evaluate cancerpatients' level of knowledge about their disease and treatment.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01699672 .
