Several guidelines have been published by nationalsocieties, but no Spanish national guidelines for management of these patientshave been published. More importantly, national clinical practice regarding thesepatients is not standardised.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Members of the Spanish Breast Cancer Radiation OncologyGroup (GEORM in Spanish) were surveyed through an online questionnaire on behalf of the Spanish radiation oncology departments.RESULTS: Only 39.3% of the Spanish radiation oncology departments have policiesaimed at CIED carrier patients. Regardless of that, 96.4% of those who responded to the survey refer these patients to their Cardiology department before thestart of the course of radiotherapy, and 17.8% of respondents said to manipulate the CIED without any cardiology department direction. A wide range of responseswas obtained related to concepts such as "distance from the irradiation field to the CIED" or "safe accumulated doses".CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the need for national guidelines for CIEDpatients and the need to promote educational activities addressed to standardise clinical management of these patients in the radiation oncology departments.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1893-5 PMID: 29796996
