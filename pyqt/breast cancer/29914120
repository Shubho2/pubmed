All the newly preparedderivatives were evaluated in vitro for their growth inhibitory activity towards the proliferation of breast cancer MCF-7 cell line. Compounds 8e and 8n werefound to be the most active congeners against MCF-7 cells (IC50 = 0.22 and 1.88&micro;M after 48 h treatment; 0.11 and 0.80 &micro;M after 72 h treatment,respectively) with increased activity compared to the reference drug doxorubicin (IC50 = 1.93 &micro;M). Moreover, eight selected pyridines 8b, 8d, 8e, 8i, 8j and8l⁻n were evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity according to theUS-NCI protocol. Pyridines 8b and 8e proved to be the most effective anticanceragents in the NCI assay with mean inhibition = 43 and 49%, respectively. Both 8b and 8e exhibited anti-proliferative activity against all tested cancer cell linesfrom all subpanels growth inhibition (GI for 8b; 12⁻78%, GI for 8e; 15⁻91%).Pyridines 8b and 8e were screened in vitro for their inhibitory activity against VEGFR-2. Both compounds inhibited VEGFR-2 at micromolar IC50 values 5.0 ± 1.91and 3.93 ± 0.73 &micro;M, respectively. The most active pyridines were filteredaccording to the Lipinski and Veber rules and all of them passed these filters.Finally, several ADME descriptors were predicted for the active pyridines througha theoretical kinetic study.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23061459 PMID: 29914120
