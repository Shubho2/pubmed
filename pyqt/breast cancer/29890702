Cancercells establish a tight relationship with the host tissue, secreting factors thatstimulate or inhibit bone cells, receiving signals generated from the boneremodeling activity, and displaying some features of bone cells. This interplaybetween tumor and bone cells alters the physiological bone remodeling, leading tothe generation of a vicious cycle that promotes bone metastasis growth. Toprevent the skeletal-related events (SRE) associated with bone metastasis,approaches to inhibit osteoclast bone resorption are reported. Thebisphosphonates and Denosumab are currently used in the treatment of patientsaffected by bone lesions. They act to prevent or counteract the SRE, includingpathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and pain associated with bonemetastasis. However, their primary effects on tumor cells still remaincontroversial. In this review, a description of the mechanisms leading to theonset of bone metastasis and clinical approaches to treat them are described.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19061709 PMCID: PMC6032429PMID: 29890702
