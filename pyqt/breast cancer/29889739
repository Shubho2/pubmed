Indications for resection wereadvanced breast cancer (n = 44), soft-tissue sarcoma (n = 38), bone sarcoma orchondrosarcoma (n = 28), desmoid tumor (n = 11), metastasis from other cancers (n= 7), and other primary tumors (n = 7). There were 72 full-thickness and 63partial-thickness resections (34 soft-tissue resections only and 29 skeletal boneresections only). Resection margins were wide (n = 29), marginal (n = 82), andintralesional (n = 24). Reconstruction was warranted in 118 cases: chest wallstabilization and flap coverage in 57, chest wall stabilization only in 36, andsoft-tissue flap coverage only in 25 cases. In total, 82 flaps were performed (17free flaps and 65 pedicled/local flaps). There were no perioperative mortalities or flap losses. Complications occurred in 29 operations (Clavien-Dindoclassifications grade II, n = 12; grade IIIa, n = 4; grade IIIb, n = 10; andgrade IVa, n = 3) and 19 reoperations were necessary. Median follow-up was 49months. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. One-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates were 84, 82, and 70 percent, respectively.CONCLUSION: With careful patient selection, appropriate perioperative andpostoperative care, and accurate surgical technique, even extensive chest wallresections and reconstructions are safe.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004597 PMID: 29889739
