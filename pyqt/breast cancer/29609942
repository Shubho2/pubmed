Electronic address: elizabeth.addington@northwestern.edu.(2)Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, United States.OBJECTIVE: To conduct a pilot trial of internet-based, cancer-adapted yoga forwomen receiving breast cancer treatment.DESIGN: Women undergoing radiation or chemotherapy for breast cancer wererecruited for 12, 75-min, biweekly, cancer-adapted yoga classes delivered viainternet-based, multipoint videoconferencing. Data were collected on feasibility and acceptability, including qualitative feedback from participants and the yoga instructor.RESULTS: Among 42 women approached, 13 declined eligibility screening, and 23were ineligible. All 6 women who were eligible provided consent, but 2 withdrewprior to beginning yoga classes. The remaining 4 participants attended 1-11 of 12online yoga classes. In post-intervention interviews, participants and theinstructor agreed that internet-based yoga classes hold great potential forincreasing access and improving psychological outcomes in adults with cancer.Qualitative feedback from participants revealed suggestions for future trials of internet-based, cancer-adapted yoga classes, including: continued use of groupformat; offering more varied class times to accommodate patients' demandingschedules and fluctuating symptoms; enrolling patients after they have acclimatedto or completed cancer treatment; streamlining the technology interface; andcareful attention to participant burden when designing surveys/forms. Theinstructor recommended closed session courses, as opposed to rolling enrollment; teaching the same modified poses for all participants, rather than individualtailoring; and using a large screen to allow closer monitoring of students' classexperience.CONCLUSIONS: Internet delivery may increase patients' access to cancer-adaptedyoga classes, but cancer-related and technological barriers remain. This studyinforms how to optimally design yoga classes, technology, and research proceduresto maximize feasibility and acceptability in future trials.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
