This study aims to compare theradiological response regarding various dose and fractionation schedules ofradiotherapy in the palliative treatment of SBM.METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 1047 patients with osteolytic SBM, treatedwith palliative radiotherapy at our department between 2000 and 2015. Lung cancer(40.2%), breast (16.7%) and renal cancer (15.2%) were the most common solidtumors in this study. Different common multi-fraction regimen (5x4Gy, 10x3Gy,14 × 2.5Gy and 20x2Gy) were compared with regard to radiological response andrecalcification at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. The Taneichi score was usedfor classification of osteolytic SBM.RESULTS: Median follow up was 6.3 months. The median overall survival (OS) in theshort-course radiotherapy (SCR) group using less than 10 treatment fractions was 5.5 months vs. 9.5 months in the long-course radiotherapy (LCR) group using inexcess of 10 fractions (log rank p < .0001). Overall survival (OS) in the SCRgroup after 3 and 6 months was 66.8 and 49.1%, respectively vs 80.9 and 61.5%,respectively in the LCR group. 17.6% (n = 54/306) and 31.1% (n = 89/286) ofunstable SBM were classified as stable in the SCR group at 3 and 6 months postradiotherapy, respectively (p < .001 for both). In the LCR group, 24.1%(n = 28/116) and 34.2% (n = 38/111) of unstable SBM were stabilized after 3 and6 months, respectively (p < .001 for both).CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows no significant difference in stabilization achievingrecalcification rates between multi-fraction schedules (SCR vs. LCR) in thepalliative management of unstable SBM. Both groups with multi-fraction regimendemonstrate a stabilizing effect following 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-1082-2 PMCID: PMC6056942PMID: 30041672
