The selection of the adequate graft material is challenging. Previous reports have described the application of expandedpolytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) for dorsal augmentation rhinoplasty, but studies using ePTFE for nose elongation are lacking. We propose ePTFE as an alternativetreatment for short noses, describe the technique, and discuss outcomes, patient selection, and complications based on our 14-year experience.METHODS: From February 2003 to December 2016, 206 patients with varying degreesof short noses were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent nose elongation surgery using an ePTFE implant. Nasal lengths before and aftersurgery were measured using a 3-dimensional simulation technology. Outcomes andcomplications including possible underlying reasons were analyzed. Patientsatisfaction was evaluated using a self-assessment survey.RESULTS: Nasal elongation was successfully achieved using ePTFE. Mean increase innasal length was 4.36 Â± 0.85 mm. The mean follow-up period was 13.3 months,ranging from 6 months to 8 years. Follow-up examinations demonstrated stableresults. The overall complication rate was 6.8%. Complications includedinfection, implant extrusion, migration, deviation, visibility, and/orprominence, tissue reaction, and reddening of the nasal skin. Most patients(93.6%) rated their outcome as improved and much improved.CONCLUSIONS: Nasal elongation using ePTFE implantation is a feasible therapeutic approach for patients with short noses. Reliable outcomes and the absence ofdonor site morbidity contribute to the high patient acceptance. Meticuloussurgical technique and careful patient selection are prerequisites for successfulresults.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001481 PMID: 29762452
