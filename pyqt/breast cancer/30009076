She was treated with diverting loop sigmoidcolostomy for her large bowel obstruction.Discussion: Our case reflects the importance of gastrointestinal surveillance of patients with a history of breast cancer. Current National Comprehensive CancerNetwork (NCCN) guidelines for stage I-II breast cancer suggest posttreatment lab and imaging evaluation for metastasis only if new symptoms present.Conclusion: We observed an unusually rapid disease progression, requiringevaluation of new gastrointestinal symptoms. Assessment for GI tract metastaticinvolvement should be done as early as progression to symptomatic disease canresult in need for further invasive surgery in advanced stages of cancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6085730 PMCID: PMC6020628PMID: 30009076
