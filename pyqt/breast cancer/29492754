Physical activity and comorbidities were self-reported.Metabolic risk factors were measured via blood analyses and included fastingglucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure.RESULTS: The sample was 38.4% male with a mean age of 59.9 ± 12.4 years. The mostcommon cancers were stomach (22.5%), cervical (14.6%), breast (14.4%), andcolorectal (11.8%). Cancer survivors meeting aerobic physical activityguidelines, compared to those completely inactive, had significantly lowerfasting glucose (p = .001), HbA1c (p = .006), and systolic blood pressure(p = .001), and significantly lower risks of hypertension (odds ratio[OR] = 0.55, 95% confidential interval [CI] = 0.32 to 0.93), diabetes (OR = 0.64,95% CI = 0.43 to 0.95), and arthritis (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.99).Moreover, cancer survivors meeting strength exercise guidelines, compared tothose not meeting guidelines, had significantly lower levels of fasting glucose(p = .001), HbA1c (p < .001), and total cholesterol (p = .031), and significantlylower risks of arthritis (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.25 to 0.85) and back pain(OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.30 to 0.83).CONCLUSION: Aerobic physical activity and strength exercise were significantlyassociated with lower risks of metabolic disturbances and comorbidities in Koreancancer survivors.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Cancer survivors should engage in at least150 min/week of aerobic exercise and at least 2 days/week of strength exercise tolower their risk of metabolic disturbances and comorbidities.DOI: 10.1007/s11764-018-0683-y PMID: 29492754
