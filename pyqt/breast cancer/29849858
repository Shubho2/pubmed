However, the incidence of breast benigndiseases is about 5 to 10 times higher than breast cancer; up to 30% of womensuffer from breast benign diseases and require treatment at some time in theirlives. Thus, in this study, MPM was applied to image fibroadenoma and fibrocysticlesion, which are two of the most common breast benign diseases. The results showthat MPM has the capability to identify the microstructure of lobule and stromain normal breast tissue, the interaction of compressed ducts with surroundingcollagen fiber in fibroadenoma, and the architecture of cysts filled with cystic fluid in fibrocystic disease. These findings indicate that, with integration ofMPM into currently accepted clinical imaging system, it has the potential to makea real-time diagnosis of breast benign diseases in vivo, as well as breastcancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/3697063 PMCID: PMC5932488PMID: 29849858
