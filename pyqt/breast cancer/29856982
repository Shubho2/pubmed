Drug resistance is the major obstacle for breast cancer treatment improvement. TRAIL-inducing compound 10 (Tic10), anovel activator of FOXO3, exhibits potent antitumor efficacy both in vitro and invivo. In the present study, we investigated the resistance reversal effect ofTic10 on multidrug-resistant breast cancer cells T47D/5Fu derived from T47Dbreast cancer cells. We found that FOXO3a was significantly decreased inT47D/5-Fu cells, whereas treatment of Tic10 enhances FOXO3a expression andnuclear translocation. Moreover, treatment of Tic10 could reverses 5-Fluorouracilresistance of T47D/5-Fu cells via induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest andapoptosis. Furthermore, we found that Tic10 decreased the expression of CDK4 via FOXO3a-dependment mechanism. In addition, our data showed that Tic10 couldsensitize drug resistant T47D/5-Fu cells to 5-Fu in vivo. Taken together, thesedata suggested Tic10 as capable of restoring sensitivity for drug-resistantbreast cancer cells.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
