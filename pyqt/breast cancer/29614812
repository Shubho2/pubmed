Ithas been reported that 20(S)-PPD shows a broad spectrum of antitumor effects. Ourresearch study aims were to investigate whether apoptosis of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells could be induced by 20(S)-PPD by targeting the Phosphatidylinositol3-kinase/Protein kinase B/Mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signalpathway in vitro and in vivo. Cell cycle analysis was performed by PropidiumIodide (PI) staining. To overexpress and knock down the expression of mTOR,pcDNA3.1-mTOR and mTOR small interfering RNA (siRNA) transient transfectionassays were used, respectively. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-test andAnnexin V /PI double-staining after transfection. The antitumor effect in vivowas determined by the nude mice xenograft assay. After 24 h of incubation,treatment with 20(S)-PPD could upregulate phosphorylated-Phosphatase and tensinhomologue deleted on chromosome 10 (p-PTEN) expression and downregulatePI3K/AKT/mTOR-pathway protein expression. Moreover, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest inMCF-7 cells could be induced by 20(S)-PPD treatment at high concentrations.Furthermore, overexpression or knockdown of mTOR could inhibit or promote theapoptotic effects of 20(S)-PPD. In addition, tumor volumes were partially reducedby 20(S)-PPD at 100 mg/kg in a MCF-7 xenograft model. Immunohistochemicalstaining indicated a close relationship between the inhibition of tumor growthand the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway. PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-mediated apoptosismay be one of the potential mechanisms of 20(S)-PPD treatment.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19041053 PMCID: PMC5979555PMID: 29614812
