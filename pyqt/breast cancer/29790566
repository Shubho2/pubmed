Methods A comprehensive search was conducted formeta-analyses published from 2007-2017 that included at least one pooled effectsize (ES) for breast cancer associated with any night shift work exposure metric and were accompanied by a systematic literature review. Pooled ES from eachmeta-analysis were ascertained with a focus on ever/never exposure associations. Assessments of heterogeneity and publication bias were also extracted. The AMSTAR2 checklist was used to evaluate quality. Results Seven meta-analyses, published from 2013-2016, collectively included 30 cohort and case-control studies spanning1996-2016. Five meta-analyses reported pooled ES for ever/never night shift work exposure; these ranged from 0.99 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-1.03, N=10cohort studies) to 1.40 (95% CI 1.13-1.73, N=9 high quality studies). Estimatesfor duration, frequency, and cumulative night shift work exposure were scant and mostly not statistically significant. Meta-analyses of cohort, Asian, and morefully-adjusted studies generally resulted in lower pooled ES than case-control,European, American, or minimally-adjusted studies. Most reported statisticallysignificant between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias was not evident in any of the meta-analyses. Only one meta-analysis was strong in critical qualitydomains. Conclusions Fairly consistent elevated pooled ES were found forever/never night shift work and breast cancer risk, but results for other shiftwork exposure metrics were inconclusive. Future evaluations of shift work should incorporate high quality meta-analyses that better appraise individual studyquality.DOI: 10.5271/sjweh.3738 PMID: 29790566
