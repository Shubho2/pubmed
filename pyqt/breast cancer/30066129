In this work, we have studied the ATP-binding mechanism withLMTK3 domain and also carried out virtual screening on LMTK3 to identify leadcompounds using Dock blaster server. The top scored compounds obtained from Dock blaster were then narrowed down further to six lead compounds (ZINC37996511,ZINC83363046, ZINC3745998, ZINC50456700, ZINC83351792 and ZINC83364581) based on high-binding affinity and non-bonding interactions with LMTK3 using Autodock 4.2 program. We found in comparison to ATP, the lead compounds bind relativelystronger to LMTK3. The relative binding free energy results from MM-PBSA/GBSAmethod further indicate the strong binding affinity of lead compounds over ATP toLMTK3 in the dynamic system. Further, potential of mean force (PMF) study for ATPand lead compounds with LMTK3 have been performed to explore the unbindingprocesses and the free energy barrier. From the PMF results, we observed that thelead compounds have higher dissociation energy barriers than the ATP. Ourfindings suggest that these lead compounds may compete with ATP, and could act asprobable potential inhibitors for LMTK3.DOI: 10.1007/s12539-018-0302-7 PMID: 30066129
