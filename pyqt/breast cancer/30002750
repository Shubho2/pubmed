Seventy-six womenwere diagnosed with ADH and 72 of them underwent subsequent surgical excision.Demographic factors, medical history, family history, clinical symptoms, type andsize of lesion determined in imaging scans, size of biopsy needle, and presenceof coexisting lesions in VABB specimens were analysed as potential predictors of malignancy underestimation.Results: Underestimation of breast carcinoma occurred in 21 (29.2%) patients. Theupgrade rate was significantly higher only in patients with a lesion visible bothin mammography (MMG) and US examinations and combined BIRADS-5.Conclusions: Vacuum-assisted core needle biopsy is a minimally invasive techniqueused in diagnosing ADH. As the risk of breast malignancy underestimation isrelatively high, open surgical biopsy remains the recommended procedure,especially in patients with lesions detected both in mammography and USexamination. As we could not identify the factors that preclude cancerunderestimation, all the women diagnosed with ADH should be informed about therisk of cancer underestimation.DOI: 10.5114/wiitm.2018.73528 PMCID: PMC6041585PMID: 30002750
