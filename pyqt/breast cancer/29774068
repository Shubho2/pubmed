It isdifficult to inhibit the growth of MDR cancer due to its chemoresistance.Furthermore, MDR cancers are more likely to metastasize, causing a high mortalityamong cancer patients. In this study, a nanomedicine RGD-NPVs@MNPs/DOX wasdeveloped by encapsulating melanin nanoparticles (MNPs) and doxorubicin (DOX)inside RGD peptide (c(RGDyC))-modified nanoscale platelet vesicles (RGD-NPVs) to efficiently inhibit the growth and metastasis of drug-resistant tumors via acancer cells and tumor vasculature dual-targeting strategy. Methods: The in vitroimmune evasion potential and the targeting performance of RGD-NPVs@MNPs/DOX were examined using RAW264.7, HUVECs, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/ADR cells lines. Wealso evaluated the pharmacokinetic behavior and the in vivo therapeuticperformance of RGD-NPVs@MNPs/DOX using a MDA-MB-231/ADR tumor-bearing nude mouse model. Results: By taking advantage of the self-recognizing property of theplatelet membrane and the conjugated RGD peptides, RGD-NPVs@MNPs/DOX was found toevade immune clearance and target the αvβ3 integrin on tumor vasculature andresistant breast tumor cells. Under irradiation with a NIR laser,RGD-NPVs@MNPs/DOX produced a multipronged effect, including reversal of cancerMDR, efficient killing of resistant cells by chemo-photothermal therapy,elimination of tumor vasculature for blocking metastasis, and long-lastinginhibition of the expressions of VEGF, MMP2 and MMP9 within the tumor.Conclusion: This versatile nanomedicine of RGD-NPVs@MNPs/DOX integrating uniquebiomimetic properties, excellent targeting performance, and comprehensivetherapeutic strategies in one formulation might bring opportunities to MDR cancertherapy.DOI: 10.7150/thno.23654 PMCID: PMC5957002PMID: 29774068
