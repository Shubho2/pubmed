Sammons Cancer Center and The US OncologyResearch Network, Dallas, USA.Background: The phase III MONALEESA-2 study demonstrated significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and a manageable toxicity profile for first-line ribociclib plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative(HER2-) advanced breast cancer. Here, we report updated efficacy and safety data,together with exploratory biomarker analyses, from the MONALEESA-2 study.Patients and methods: A total of 668 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2-recurrent/metastatic breast cancer were randomized (1 : 1; stratified bypresence/absence of liver and/or lung metastases) to ribociclib (600 mg/day;3-weeks-on/1-week-off; 28-day treatment cycles) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day;continuous) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was locally assessedPFS. The key secondary end point was overall survival (OS). Other secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) and safety. Biomarker analysis was anexploratory end point.Results: At the time of the second interim analysis, the median duration offollow-up was 26.4 months. Median PFS was 25.3 months [95% confidence interval(CI) 23.0-30.3] for ribociclib plus letrozole and 16.0 months (95% CI 13.4-18.2) for placebo plus letrozole (hazard ratio 0.568; 95% CI 0.457-0.704; log-rankP = 9.63 × 10-8). Ribociclib treatment benefit was maintained irrespective ofPIK3CA or TP53 mutation status, total Rb, Ki67, or p16 protein expression, andCDKN2A, CCND1, or ESR1 mRNA levels. Ribociclib benefit was more pronounced inpatients with wild-type versus altered receptor tyrosine kinase genes. OS dataremain immature, with 116 deaths observed; 50 in the ribociclib arm and 66 in theplacebo arm (hazard ratio 0.746; 95% CI 0.517-1.078). The ORR was 42.5% versus28.7% for all patients treated with ribociclib plus letrozole versus placebo plusletrozole, respectively, and 54.5% versus 38.8%, respectively, for patients with measurable disease. Safety results, after a further 11.1 months of follow-up,were comparable with those reported at the first analysis, with no new orunexpected toxicities observed, and no evidence of cumulative toxicity.Conclusions: The improved efficacy outcomes and manageable tolerability observed with first-line ribociclib plus letrozole are maintained with longer follow-up,relative to letrozole monotherapy.Clinical trials number: NCT01958021.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy155 PMID: 29718092
