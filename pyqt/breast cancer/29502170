The most frequently observed second primary tumor affected thedigestive tract (27.8%). The frequency of observed cancers was similar to thatexpected in the general population, excepting for an excess of melanoma [SIR 1.98(1.52-2.53)], uterine cancers [SIR 1.44 (1.17-1.74)], ovarian cancers [SIR 1.67(1.31-2.10)], thyroid tumors [SIR 1.54 (1.23-1.92)], and leukemia [SIR 1.57(1.11-2.16)].RESULTS: Clinicopathological breast cancer stratification showed a generalincreased risk of developing a second cancer in older patients, excluding ovariancancer. An increased risk of developing ovarian cancer after breast cancerdiagnosis was observed, in particular, in triple-negative [HR 3.47 (1.91-6.29)], G3 tumors [HR 2.54 (1.10-5.83)] and in positive breast cancer family history [HR 2.19 (1.22-3.94)]. Breast cancer survivors in hormonal therapy treatment are athigher risk for developing a second thyroid cancer [HR 4.00 (1.46-10.9)].Conversely, adjuvant chemotherapy offered a protective effect on thyroid cancerrisk development [HR 0.46 (0.28-0.76)].CONCLUSIONS: Older age represents the major risk of developing a second primarynon-breast cancer, excluding ovarian cancer. Clinical surveillance is required toprevent ovarian and thyroid cancers, respectively, in patients with positivefamily history, triple negative, G3 breast cancer and during hormonal therapytreatment in postmenopausal status.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2621-9 PMID: 29502170  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
