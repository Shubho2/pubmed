The therapeutic benefits of poly ADP-ribosepolymerase (PARP) inhibitors in treatment of BRCA1/2-related ovarian cancers has resulted in an increased demand and urgency for genetic testing results, whiletechnological developments have led to widespread use of multi-gene cancer panelsand development of tumour testing protocols. Traditional genetic counsellingmodels are no longer sustainable and must evolve to match the rapid evolution of genetic testing technologies and developments in personalized medicine. Recently,representatives from oncology, clinical genetics, molecular genetics, pathology, and patient advocacy came together to create a national multi-disciplinaryCanadian consortium. By aligning stakeholder interests, the BRCA Testing toTreatment (BRCA TtoT) Community of Practice aims to develop a national strategyfor tumour and germline BRCA1/2 testing and genetic counselling in women withovarian cancer. This article serves to provide an overview of the recentevolution of genetic assessment for BRCA1/2-associated gynecologic malignanciesand outline a Canadian roadmap to facilitate change, improve genetic testingrates, and ultimately improve outcomes for hereditary ovarian cancer patients andtheir families.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.
