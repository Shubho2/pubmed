Schott Extracts as Antioxidant and Anti-breast Cancer Source: A Comparative Study.Kant K(1), Lal UR(1), Ghosh M(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology, Birla Institute ofTechnology, Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India.Background: Globally, reactive oxygen species have served as an alarm predecessortoward pathogenesis of copious oxidative stress-related diseases. The researchershave turned their attention toward plant-derived herbal goods due to theirpromising therapeutic applications with minimal side effects. Arisaema tortuosum (Wall.) Schott (ATWS) is used in the traditional medicine since ancient years,but scientific assessments are relatively inadequate and need to be unlocked.Objective: Our aim was designed to validate the ATWS tuber and leaf extracts asan inhibitor of oxidative stress using computational approach.Materials and Methods: The reported chief chemical entities of ATWS were dockedusing Maestro 9.3 (Schrödinger, LLC, Cambridge, USA) tool and further ATWSextracts (tubers and leaves) were validated with 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl(DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt(ABTS), ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and sulforhodamine B assaysexperimentally.Results: In silico results showed notable binding affinity of ATWSphytoconstituents with the receptor (PDB: 3ERT). Experimentally, butanolic tuber fraction confirmed promising antioxidant potential (ABTS: IC50: 271.67 μg/ml;DPPH: IC50: 723.41 μg/ml) with a noteworthy amount of FRAP (195.96 μg/mg), total phenolic content (0.087 μg/mg), and total flavonoid content (7.5 μg/mg) whilechloroform fraction (leaves) showed considerable reduction in the cell viability of MCF-7 cell line.Conclusion: The current findings may act as a precious tool to further unlocknovel potential therapeutic agents against oxidative stress.SUMMARY: Quercetin showed top.ranked glide score with notable binding toward 3ERTreceptorAmong extracts, butanolic tubers confirmed as promising antioxidant with remarkable amount of TPC and TFCIn addition, chloroform fraction (leaves)revealed considerable decline in the cell viability of MCF-7 cell line.Abbreviations used: ATWS: Arisaema tortuosum (Wall.)
