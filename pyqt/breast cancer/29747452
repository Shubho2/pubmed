In severalcancers, KRT19 is overexpressed and may play a crucial role in tumorigenictransformation. In our previous study, we revealed the role of KRT19 as signalingcomponent which mediated Wnt/NOTCH crosstalk through NUMB transcription in breastcancer. Here, we investigated the function of KRT19 in cancer reprogramming anddrug resistance in breast cancer cells. We found that expression of KRT19 wasattenuated in several patients-derived breast cancer tissues and patients with a low expression of KRT19 were significantly correlated with poor prognosis inbreast cancer patients. Consistently, highly aggressive and drug-resistant breastcancer patient-derived cancer stem cell-like cells (konkuk university-cancer stemcell-like cell (KU-CSLCs)) displayed higher expression of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers, including ALDH1, CXCR4, and CD133, but a much lower expression of KRT19 than that is seen in highly aggressive triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB231cells. Moreover, we revealed that the knockdown of KRT19 in MDA-MB231 cells ledto an enhancement of cancer properties, such as cell proliferation, sphereformation, migration, and drug resistance, while the overexpression of KRT19 inKU-CSLCs resulted in the significant attenuation of cancer properties. KRT19regulated cancer stem cell reprogramming by modulating the expression of cancerstem cell markers (ALDH1, CXCR4, and CD133), as well as the phosphorylation ofSrc and GSK3&beta; (Tyr216). Therefore, our data may imply that the modulation ofKRT19 expression could be involved in cancer stem cell reprogramming and drugsensitivity, which might have clinical implications for cancer or cancer stemcell treatment.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19051423 PMCID: PMC5983664PMID: 29747452
