Author to whom any correspondence should beaddressed.This study aims to investigate the feasibility of identifying a new quantitative imaging marker based on false-positives generated by a computer-aided detection(CAD) scheme to help predict short-term breast cancer risk. An image datasetincluding four view mammograms acquired from 1044 women was retrospectivelyassembled. All mammograms were originally interpreted as negative byradiologists. In the next subsequent mammography screening, 402 women werediagnosed with breast cancer and 642 remained negative. An existing CAD schemewas applied 'as is' to process each image. From CAD-generated results, fourdetection features including the total number of (1) initial detection seeds and (2) the final detected false-positive regions, (3) average and (4) sum ofdetection scores, were computed from each image. Then, by combining the features computed from two bilateral images of left and right breasts from eithercraniocaudal or mediolateral oblique view, two logistic regression models weretrained and tested using a leave-one-case-out cross-validation method to predict the likelihood of each testing case being positive in the next subsequentscreening. The new prediction model yielded the maximum prediction accuracy with an area under a ROC curve of AUC  =  0.65  ±  0.017 and the maximum adjusted oddsratio of 4.49 with a 95% confidence interval of (2.95, 6.83). The results alsoshowed an increasing trend in the adjusted odds ratio and risk prediction scores (p  <  0.01). Thus, this study demonstrated that CAD-generated false-positivesmight include valuable information, which needs to be further explored foridentifying and/or developing more effective imaging markers for predictingshort-term breast cancer risk.DOI: 10.1088/1361-6560/aabefe PMCID: PMC5976448 [Available on 2019-05-15]PMID: 29667606
