In particular, radiomic approaches have paved the way to the study of the cancer imaging phenotypes. In this work, a group of 49patients with diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma was studied. The purpose of this study was to select radiomic features extracted from a DCE-MRIpharmacokinetic protocol, including quantitative maps of ktrans, kep, ve, iAUC,and R1 and to construct predictive models for the discrimination of molecularreceptor status (ER+/ER-, PR+/PR-, and HER2+/HER2-), triple negative(TN)/non-triple negative (NTN), ki67 levels, and tumor grade. A total of 163features were obtained and, after feature set reduction step, followed by featureselection and prediction performance estimations, the predictive modelcoefficients were computed for each classification task. The AUC values obtained were 0.826 ± 0.006 for ER+/ER-, 0.875 ± 0.009 for PR+/PR-, 0.838 ± 0.006 forHER2+/HER2-, 0.876 ± 0.007 for TN/NTN, 0.811 ± 0.005 for ki67+/ki67-, and 0.895 ±0.006 for lowGrade/highGrade. In conclusion, DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic-basedphenotyping shows promising for discrimination of the histological outcomes.DOI: 10.1155/2018/5076269 PMCID: PMC5822818PMID: 29581709
