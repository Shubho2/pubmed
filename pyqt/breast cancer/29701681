There is a shortage of efficient tools for integrative analysis of gene expression and protein interaction networks for discovering common modulesassociated with cancer progression. To address this issue, we propose a novelregularized multi-view subspace clustering (rMV-spc) algorithm to obtain arepresentation matrix for each stage and a joint representation matrix thatbalances the agreement across various stages. To avoid the heterogeneity of data,the protein interaction network is incorporated into the objective of rMV-spc viaregularization. Based on the interior point algorithm, we solve the optimization problem to obtain the common modules. By using artificial networks, wedemonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods interms of accuracy. Furthermore, the rMV-spc discovers common modules in breastcancer networks based on the breast data, and these modules serve as biomarkersto predict stages of breast cancer. The proposed model and algorithm effectively integrate heterogeneous data for dynamic modules.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23051016 PMID: 29701681
