Further research is warranted toidentify significant prognostic and predictive factors.METHODS: We identified all HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patientsreceiving trastuzumab at the Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre (SOCC) from 1999 to 2013 through the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Registry (n = 256) and selectedpatients with available pathology reports (n = 154). A retrospective review wascompleted documenting clinical, pathologic, and laboratory characteristics at thetime of first trastuzumab therapy and survival outcomes. Cox proportional hazardsregression models were used to identify prognostic factors for overall survival(OS) (primary endpoint) and failure-free survival (FFS), adjusted for the knownprognostic factors of the presence of CNS metastases and the presence of ≥ 2distant metastatic sites.RESULTS: A multivariable model identified older age [hazard ratio (HR)1.18/decade, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.37)], increasedplatelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (HR 1.75/log-unit, 95% CI 1.25-2.46),increased serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (HR 1.87/log-unit, 95% CI 1.41-2.49), and ER positivity (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42-0.96) as significant prognostic factorsfor OS after adjusting for the presence of CNS metastasis (HR 3.19, 95% CI1.59-6.38) and the presence of ≥ 2 distant metastatic sites (HR 2.10, 95% CI1.19-3.70). PLR (HR 1.54/log-unit, 95% CI 1.12-2.12) was the only prognosticfactor associated with FFS after adjusting for CNS and ≥ 2 distant metastaticsites.CONCLUSION: Older age, increased PLR, and ALP were identified as poor prognostic factors and ER positivity as a favorable prognostic factor for OS after adjustingfor the presence of CNS metastasis and the presence of number of ≥ 2 distantmetastatic sites. Increased PLR was a poor prognostic factor for both OS and FFS,and warrants further investigation into its prognostic ability amongst patientswith HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4734-x PMID: 29520532
