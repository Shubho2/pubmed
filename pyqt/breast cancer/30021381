However, its biological role in thedevelopment of colorectal cancer (CRC) still remains unclear. In this study, wefound that miR-519d-3p expression level was remarkably down-regulated in CRCtissues samples and cell lines when compared to adjacent normal tissues and cell line by using qRT-PCR detection. Lower miR-519d-3p expression was significantlycorrelated with TNM stage, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. CRC patientswith high level of miR-519d-3p had higher five-year survival rate than those withlow expression of miR-519d-3p (p = 0.01178) using Kaplan-Meier analysis.Moreover, multivariate analysis suggested that miR-519d-3p expression might be anindependent prognostic indicator for the survival of CRC patients. The in vitrofunctional analysis, including MTT, flow cytometry and transwell assays indicatedthat miR-519d-3p overexpression significantly suppressed cell proliferation,migration and invasion, induced cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest and cell apoptosis of CRC cells. Furthermore, bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays verifiedthat trophinin associated protein (TROAP) was a direct target of miR-519d-3p inCRC cells. Using Oncomine database analysis, TROAP was confirmed to beupregulated in human CRC tissues. In addition, we found knockdown of TROAPpresented similar inhibitory effects of miR-519d-3p overexpression in CRC cellfunction. In conclusion, miR-519d-3p might be a promising therapeutic strategyagainst human CRC by directly targeting TROAP.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..
