Surgical morbidity of risk-reductionmastectomy (RRM) with concurrent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) isunknown. Outcomes in these patients were compared to patients undergoing RRMwithout BSO using a large multi-institutional database.METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using the American Collegeof Surgeon's National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) 2007-2016datasets, comparing postoperative morbidity between patients undergoing RRM with patients undergoing RRM with concurrent BSO. Patients with genetic susceptibilityto breast/ovarian cancer undergoing risk-reduction surgery were identified. Theprimary outcome was 30-day postoperative major morbidity. Secondary outcomesincluded surgical site infections, reoperations, readmissions, length of stay,and venous thromboembolic events. A multivariate analysis was performed todetermine predictors of postoperative morbidity and the adjusted effect ofconcurrent BSO on morbidity.RESULTS: Of the 5470 patients undergoing RRM, 149 (2.7%) underwent concurrentBSO. The overall rate of major morbidity and postoperative infections was 4.5%and 4.6%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the rate ofpostoperative major morbidity (4.5% vs 4.7%, p = 0.91) or any of the secondaryoutcomes between patients undergoing RRM without BSO vs. those undergoing RRMwith concurrent BSO. Multivariable analysis showed Body Mass Index (OR 1.05;p < 0.001) and smoking (OR 1.78; p = 0.003) to be the only predictors associated with major morbidity. Neither immediate breast reconstruction (OR 1.02; p = 0.93)nor concurrent BSO (OR 0.94; p = 0.89) were associated with increasedpostoperative major morbidity.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that RRM with concurrent BSO was notassociated with significant additional morbidity when compared to RRM withoutBSO. Therefore, this joint approach may be considered for select patients at riskfor both breast and ovarian cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4818-7 PMID: 29761322
