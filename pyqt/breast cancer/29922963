Sex hormone treatmentof conditions in older non-transgender people might as yet be taken as the bestavailable analogy to hormone administration to aging transgender persons.Testosterone administration to transgender men carries little risk with regard tocardiovascular disease and cancer. A dose adaptation may be needed in men with a high hematocrit or cardiac insufficiency. In transgender men, even after breastablation, breast cancer may occur in residual mammary tissue. Treatment withestrogens (specifically oral ethinylestradiol) of transgender women, particularlyin combination with progestins, carries a significant relative risk of developingcardiovascular disease (almost a twofold incidence compared to the generalpopulation). The dose of estrogens may have to be reduced with aging. A changefrom oral to probably safer transdermal estrogens must be considered. Thoughrare, tumors of the breasts, prostate, meninges and pituitary have beenencountered. Based upon the available expertise, initiation of cross-sex hormone treatment in elderly subjects is without disproportionate risks.DOI: 10.1007/s11154-018-9449-0 PMID: 29922963
