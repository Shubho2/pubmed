Thus, we examined these outcomes inmetastatic breast cancer patients to provide patients' perspectives on clinicallymeaningful symptom improvement and priorities for symptom management.METHODS: Eighty women with metastatic breast cancer participated in a survey withmeasures of comorbidity, functional status, engagement in roles and activities,distress, quality of life, and the modified Patient-Centered OutcomesQuestionnaire that focused on 10 common symptoms in cancer patients.RESULTS: On average, patients reported low to moderate severity across the 10symptoms and expected symptom treatment to be successful. Patients indicated thata 49% reduction in fatigue, 48% reduction in thinking problems, and 43% reductionin sleep problems would represent successful symptom treatment. Cluster analysis based on ratings of the importance of symptom improvement yielded three clusters of patients: (1) those who rated thinking problems, sleep problems, and fatigueas highly important, (2) those who rated pain as moderately important, and (3)those who rated all symptoms as highly important. The first patient clusterdiffered from other subgroups in severity of thinking problems and education.CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic breast cancer patients report differing symptom treatmentpriorities and criteria for treatment success across symptoms. Considering cancerpatients' perspectives on clinically meaningful symptom improvement andpriorities for symptom management will ensure that treatment is consistent withtheir values and goals.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4244-8 PMID: 29736866
