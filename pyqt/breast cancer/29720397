QTc interval duration is influenced by sex hormones: oestradiolprolongs and testosterone shortens QTc. Drugs used in the treatment of breastcancer have divergent effects on hormonal status.METHODS: We performed a disproportionality analysis using the European databaseof suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports to evaluate the reporting OR(ROR χ2) of LQT, TdP and ventricular arrhythmias associated with selectiveoestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs: tamoxifen and toremifene) as opposed toaromatase inhibitors (AIs: anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole). When theproportion of an ADR is greater in patients exposed to a drug (SERMs) comparedwith patients exposed to control drug (AIs), this suggests an association betweenthe specific drug and the reaction and is a potential signal for safety. Clinicaland demographic characterisation of patients with SERMs-induced LQT andventricular arrhythmias was performed.RESULTS: SERMs were associated with higher proportion of LQT reports versus AIs(26/8318 vs 11/14851, ROR: 4.2 (2.11-8.55), p<0.001). SERMs were also associated with higher proportion of TdP and ventricular arrhythmia reports versus AIs(6/8318 vs 2/14851, ROR: 5.4 (1.29-26.15), p:0.02; 16/8318 vs 12/14851, ROR: 2.38(1.15-4.94), p:0.02, respectively). Mortality was 38% in patients presentingventricular arrhythmias associated with SERMs.CONCLUSIONS: SERMs are associated with more reports of drug-induced LQT, TdP and ventricular arrhythmias compared with AIs. This finding is consistent withoestradiol-like properties of SERMs on the heart as opposed to effects ofoestrogen deprivation and testosterone increase induced by AIs.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03259711.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
