The aim of thisstudy was to investigate the correlation between Ki-67 expression and thehemodynamics of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in patients with infiltrativeductal carcinoma (IDC). CEUS was performed on 109 masses in 85 IDC cases beforeresection. Based on the immunohistochemical staining on the antigen Ki-67, themasses were divided into negative group, weakly positive group, positive group,and strong-positive group. Significant statistical differences were noticed intime to peak, arrive intensity, and peak intensity in the positive groupscompared with the negative group. Compared with the positive groups, the negativegroup showed significant statistical differences in arrive intensity and peakintensity. The antigen Ki-67 was positively correlated with arrived intensity,intensity changes, and rising curve's slope. In contrast, it was negativelycorrelated with arrived time, time to peak, and continuous time. The hemodynamic parameters of CEUS were correlated with the expression of antigen Ki-67. On this basis, Ki-67 is an effective supplement to the diagnosis of IDC.PMID: 29981615  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
