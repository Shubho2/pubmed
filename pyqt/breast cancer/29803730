This has led to intense interestin developing compounds capable of modulating the synthesis of steroid hormones. Compounds capable of inhibiting Cyp19 (Aromatase), a key enzyme in the synthesis of estrogens, have been successfully employed as breast cancer therapies, whileinhibitors of Cyp17 (17α-hydroxylase-17,20-lyase), a key enzyme in the synthesis of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and steroidal sex hormones, are a keycomponent of prostate cancer therapy. Inhibition of CYP17 has also been suggestedas a possible target for the treatment of Cushing Syndrome and MetabolicSyndrome. We have identified two novel series of stilbene based CYP17 inhibitors and demonstrated that exemplary compounds in these series have pharmacokineticproperties consistent with orally delivered drugs. These findings suggest thatcompounds in these classes may be useful for the treatment of diseases andconditions associated with improper regulation of glucocorticoids synthesis andglucocorticoids receptor activation.Copyright © 2018.
