Interaction between Foxo1and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), effecting cell cycle, has been demonstrated in breastcancer cells, but has not been studied thus far in β-cells. Using human isletsand the INS1-E β-cell line, this study investigated the contribution of Foxo1 to E2-mediated β-cell replication. Foxo1 expression was knocked down in INS1-E cellsusing siRNA and Foxo1 activity was inhibited in human islets with a specificFoxo1 inhibitor (AS1842856). Cells were treated with E2 and the ERα agonist PPTand evaluated for proliferation by 3[H]-thymidine incorporation and fortranscriptional activity through the estrogen response element by the luciferase assay. As Foxo1 activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, theeffect of E2 on phosphorylation was also assessed. In INS1-E cells, knock down ofFoxo1 abrogated the proliferative response to E2 and PPT. In human islets,inhibition of Foxo1 abrogated E2-mediated proliferation and attenuated theresponse to PPT. Foxo1 knock down and inhibition reduced activity through theestrogen response element by 25% (p<0.05) and 50% (p<0.01) respectively, inINS1-E cells. E2 increased Foxo1 phosphorylation in a time dependent manner inINS1-E and human islets (p<0.01, p<0.05, respectively). These findings suggestthat Foxo1 is involved in E2-mediated proliferation in INS1-E cells and humanislets. This may have implications vis-à-vis variations in circulating endogenousE2 concentrations in diabetes.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.DOI: 10.1055/a-0603-3969 PMID: 29727907
