The same cellular behaviors are also affected by the mechanicalproperties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) substratum, which induces signaling through integrins and integrin-linked kinase (ILK). Here, we examined the role ofsubstratum stiffness in the regulation of cell proliferation downstream of Wnt3a.We found that treatment with Wnt3a increased proliferation of cells cultured onstiff substrata, with compliances characteristic of breast tumors, but not ofcells on soft substrata, with compliances comparable to that of normal mammarytissue. Depleting ILK rendered cells unresponsive to Wnt3a on both substrata.Ectopic expression of ILK permitted Wnt3a to induce proliferation of cells onboth microenvironments, although proliferation on soft substrata remained lowerthan that on stiff substrata. We further showed that ILK regulates expression of the Wnt receptor frizzled-1 (Fzd1), suggesting the presence of a positivefeedback loop between Wnt3a, ILK and Fzd1. These findings suggest that tissuemechanics regulates the cellular response to Wnt under physiological andpathological microenvironmental conditions.This article has an associated FirstPerson interview with the first author of the paper.© 2018.
