Towards identifying cognate inhibitors of NOG, structure based virtualscreen was employed. A total of 8.5 million ligands from e-molecule database werescreened at a novel binding site on NOG identified by the Sitemap tool, employingGLIDE algorithm. Potential eight molecules were selected based on the Glidescore, binding mode and H-bond interactions. Free energy of binding wascalculated using Molecular mechanics based MMGBSA and the obtained energy wasused in the prioritizing the compounds with the similar structures and glidescore. Further, the compounds were evaluated for their druggability employingphysico-chemical property analysis. Our study helped in identifying novelpotential NOG inhibitors that can further be validated using in-vivo and in-vitrostudies and these molecules can also be employed as tool compounds to study thefunctions of BMP.DOI: 10.6026/97320630014015 PMCID: PMC5818642PMID: 29497255
