Thus tumour suppressors, such as FOXP3, which is mutatedor lost in many cancer tissues, play an important role in maintaining normaltissue homeostasis. Here we show for the first time that ZEB2 is selectively downregulated by FOXP3 and also by the FOXP3 induced microRNA, miR-155.Interestingly, neither FOXP3 nor miR-155 directly altered the expression of ZEB1.In breast cancer cells repression of ZEB2, independently of ZEB1, resulted inreduced expression of a mesenchymal marker, Vimentin and reduced invasion.However, there was no de-repression of E-cadherin and migration was enhanced.Small interfering RNAs targeting ZEB2 suggest that this was a direct effect ofZEB2 and not FOXP3/miR-155. In normal human mammary epithelial cells, depletionof endogenous FOXP3 resulted in de-repression of ZEB2, accompanied by upregulatedexpression of vimentin, increased E-cadherin expression and cell morphologicalchanges. We suggest that FOXP3 may help maintain normal breast epithelialcharacteristics through regulation of ZEB2, and loss of FOXP3 in breast cancercells results in deregulation of ZEB2.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25523 PMCID: PMC6021232PMID: 29963231
