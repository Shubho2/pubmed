In this study, we examined CDR1 expression in cerebellum and in ovarian and breast tumors, as well as the intracellular localization of CDR1in cancer cells in culture. CDR1 was strongly expressed in the cytosol anddendrites of Purkinje cells and in interneurons of the molecular layer incerebellum. CDR1 was also present in ovarian and breast tumors, as well as inovarian and breast cancer cell lines, but was not present in normal breast orovarian tissue. In cells overexpressing CDR1, CDR1 localized close to the plasma membrane in a polarized pattern at one edge. CDR1 was strongly expressed on theouter surface, apparently in filopodias or lamellipodias, in cells endogenouslyexpressing CDR1. Overexpression of CDR1 showed a 37 and a 45 kDa band in western blot. The 37-kDa isoform was present in 16 ovarian cancer lysates, while the45-kDa isoform was only found in three ovarian cancer patients. The presence ofCDR1 in ovarian cancer was not associated with PCD. CDR1 antibodies were onlyfound in serum from one patient with PCD and ovarian tumor with metastases.Therefore, CDR1 is probably not a marker for PCD. However, CDR1 may be associatedwith cell migration and differentiation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25252 PMCID: PMC5963614PMID: 29844866
