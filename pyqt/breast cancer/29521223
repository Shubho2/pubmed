For most drugs, the underlyingmechanism of drug-induced myopathy remains unclear. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) mediate L-lactic acid transport, and inhibition of MCTs may potentiallylead to perturbation of L-lactic acid accumulation and muscular disorders.Therefore, we hypothesized that L-lactic acid transport may be involved in thedevelopment of drug-induced myopathy. The aim of this study was to assess theinhibitory potential of 24 acidic drugs on L-lactic acid transport using breastcancer cell lines Hs578T and MDA-MB-231, which selectively express MCT1 and MCT4,respectively.METHODS: The influx transport of L-lactic acid was minimally inhibited by alldrugs tested. The efflux transport was next examined: loratadine (IC50: 10 and 61µM) and atorvastatin (IC50: 78 and 41 µM) demonstrated the greatest potency forinhibition of L-lactic acid efflux by MCT1 and MCT4, respectively. Acidic drugsincluding fluvastatin, cerivastatin, simvastatin acid, lovastatin acid,irbesartan and losartan exhibited weak inhibitory potency on L-lactic acidefflux.RESULTS: Our results suggest that some acidic drugs, such as loratadine andatorvastatin, can inhibit the efflux transport of L-lactic acid.CONCLUSION: This inhibition may cause an accumulation of intracellular L-lacticacid leading to acidification and muscular disorders.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1389201019666180308091504 PMID: 29521223
