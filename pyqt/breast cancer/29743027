This maybe relevant in cancer diseases with low metabolism, such as breast cancer. Weaimed at examining the change in SUV from 1 h (1h) to 3 h (3h) time-point imagingin local and distant lesions in patients with recurrent breast cancer.Furthermore, we investigated the effect of partial volume correction in thedifferent types of metastases, using semi-automatic quantitative software(ROVER™).METHODS: One-hundred and two patients with suspected breast cancer recurrenceunderwent whole-body PET/CT scans 1h and 3h after FDG injection.Semi-quantitative standardised uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean) and partial volumecorrected SUVmean (cSUVmean), were estimated in malignant lesions, and asreference in healthy liver tissue. The change in quantitative measures from 1h to3h was calculated, and SUVmean was compared to cSUVmean. Metastases were verifiedby biopsy.RESULTS: Of the 102 included patients, 41 had verified recurrent disease with in median 15 lesions (range 1-70) amounting to a total of 337 malignant lesionsincluded in the analysis. SUVmax of malignant lesions increased from 6.4 ± 3.4[0.9-19.7] (mean ± SD, min and max) at 1h to 8.1 ± 4.4 [0.7-29.7] at 3h. SUVmaxin breast, lung, lymph node and bone lesions increased significantly (p < 0.0001)between 1h and 3h by on average 25, 40, 33, and 27%, respectively. A similarpattern was observed with (uncorrected) SUVmean. Partial volume correctionincreased SUVmean significantly, by 63 and 71% at 1h and 3h imaging,respectively. The highest impact was in breast lesions at 3h, where cSUVmeanincreased by 87% compared to SUVmean.CONCLUSION: SUVs increased from 1h to 3h in malignant lesions, SUVs of distantrecurrence were in general about twice as high as those of local recurrence.Partial volume correction caused significant increases in these values. However, it is questionable, if these relatively modest quantitative advances of 3himaging are sufficient to warrant delayed imaging in this patient group.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrails.gov NCT01552655 .
