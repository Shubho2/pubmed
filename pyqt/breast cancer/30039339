Patients received T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg) with full-dose pertuzumab (aloading dose of 840 mg and then 420 mg) intravenously every 3 weeks. This studywas registered at the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center-Clinical TrialsInformation (JapicCTI-101234).RESULTS: Six patients enrolled in this study. The median duration of treatmentwas 11 (range 1-32) cycles. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event(TEAE) for any grade was diarrhea. Grade 3 or greater TEAEs included aspartateaminotransferase increased, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased, and neutrophil count decreased. The dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 LVEFdecreased was observed in one patient during cycle 1; however, it resolved within30 days. The pharmacokinetic parameters of T-DM1 and pertuzumab were not affectedby co-administration of the drugs. The best overall response included a partialresponse (PR) in 3 patients (50%) and stable disease (SD) in 2 patients (33%).CONCLUSIONS: The combination of T-DM1 and pertuzumab was tolerated and showedexploratory efficacy in Japanese patients with HER2-positive metastatic breastcancer.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0887-z PMID: 30039339
