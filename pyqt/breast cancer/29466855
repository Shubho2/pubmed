One of the most significantbiological interruptions to Myc protein is noted as its dimerization with Maxprotein, another important factor of family of transcription factors. Binding of this heterodimer to E-Boxes, enhancer boxes as DNA response element found in someeukaryotes that act as a protein-binding site and have been found to regulategene expression, are interrupted to regulate cancer pathogenesis. The systemiceffectiveness of potent small molecule inhibitors of Myc-Max dimerization hasbeen limited by poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and inadequate targetsite penetration. The potential of gene therapy for targeting Myc can be fullyrealized by successful synthesis of a smart cargo. We developed a "nuclein" type nanoparticle "siNozyme" (45 ± 5 nm) from nanoassembly of pamitoyl-bioconjugatedacetyl coenzyme-A for stable incorporation of chemotherapeutics and biologics to achieve remarkable growth inhibition of human melanoma. Results indicated thattargeting transcriptional gene cMyc with siRNA with codelivery of a topoisomeraseinhibitor, amonafide caused ∼90% growth inhibition and 95% protein inhibition.DOI: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00117 PMID: 29466855
