Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) originate from primary sites or metastases and circulate in the patients' bloodstream. Molecularassays for the detection and molecular characterization of CTCs can serve as aliquid biopsy and can represent an alternative to invasive biopsies as a sourceof tumor tissue in the metastatic patients.Patients and Methods: We analyzed the presence of CTCs in the peripheral blood of50 breast cancer patients by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect trefoil factor family (TFF) 1 and 3genes.Results: We found significant difference in the level of both TFF1 and TFF3 mRNA in the blood of nonmetastatic versus metastatic breast cancer patients (p= 0.001 and p= 0.038, respectively). TFF1 mRNA was detected at higher levels in 34.6% of metastatic breast cancer patients as compared to 0% of nonmetastatic (p= 0.002). As regards TFF3 mRNA, it was detected at higher levels in 46.2% of metastaticbreast cancer patients as compared to 4% of nonmetastatic (p= 0.026). Moreover,we found that the high level of both TFF1 and TFF3 mRNA was related to estrogenstatus of the patients. The detection of high level of TFF1 mRNA in CTCs wasassociated with bone metastases (77.8%), while that of TFF3 was related to lymph node involvement (75%) and lung metastases (68.8%).Conclusion: The combined measurement of both TFF1 and TFF3 mRNA level fordifferentiation of metastatic from nonmetastatic breast cancer gave 57.69%sensitivity and 83.3% specificity.DOI: 10.1155/2018/4793498 PMCID: PMC6011051PMID: 29977293
