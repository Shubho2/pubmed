Performance characteristics evaluated for the current study includedsensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictivevalue (NPV), number needed to investigate (NNI), and accuracy.RESULTS: A total of 239,196 patients were included in the analysis. For theoverall cohort, the required PPV (for the recognition of lung metastases) is10.6% and NNI to detect one case of lung metastasis is 9.4. Likewise, PPV (forthe recognition of bone metastases) is 18.6% and NNI to detect one case of bonemetastasis is 5.3. Moreover, PPV (for the recognition of liver metastases) is7.6% and NNI to detect one case of liver metastasis is 13.1. When changing thethreshold for baseline imaging to includeT2N1 patients, a better balance between sensitivity and specificity among ER+/Her2- patients (> 92% for both sensitivity and specificity for the three metastatic sites) was observed. On the other hand, the proposed change improved sensitivity while it lowers significantly thespecificity among Her2+ and triple negative subtypes (specificity < 84% for Her2+disease for the three metastatic sites; specificity < 87% for triple negativedisease for the three metastatic sites).CONCLUSION: The current NCCN recommendations for breast cancer staging have anexcellent NPV and miss only few patients with lung, liver, or bone metastases.Future studies incorporating the subtype of breast cancer as a determinant ofstaging pathway is needed.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4893-9 PMID: 30022329
