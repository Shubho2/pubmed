The nucleic acid-functionalized NMOFs were loaded with the anti-cancerdrug doxorubicin (or Rhodamine 6G as a drug model), and the loaded NMOFs werecapped by hybridization with the VEGF aptamer that yielded VEGF-responsive duplexnucleic acid gates. In the presence of VEGF, a biomarker over-expressed in cancercells, selective unlocking of the gates proceeds through the formation ofVEGF/aptamer complexes, resulting in the release of the loads. In addition, theVEGF aptamer locking units were conjugated to the AS1411 aptamer sequence thatbinds to nucleolin receptors associated with cancer cells, resulting in theconstruction of cancer-cell targeted VEGF-responsive doxorubicin-loaded NMOFs.The different drug-loaded stimuli-responsive NMOFs reveal selective permeationinto MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, compared to their incorporation into normal MCF-10A breast cells, with a two-fold enhanced incorporation into the MDA-MB-231 cells of the AS1411 aptamer-functionalized NMOFs. Cytotoxicity experimentsrevealed impressive selective apoptosis of the doxorubicin-loaded NMOFs towardsthe MDA-MB-231 cancer cells compared to the normal MCF-10A breast cells. A 55%and 70% MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis was observed upon subjecting the cells to theVEGF aptamer and the VEGF aptamer/AS1411 aptamer conjugate-caged NMOFs,respectively, for a time-interval of three days, where only <10% apoptosis of theMCF-10A cells was observed under similar conditions.DOI: 10.1039/c8nr00193f PMID: 29465130
