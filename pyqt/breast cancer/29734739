Herein, to give further insights into the inhibitory activity on cell growth of these classes of compounds, the synthesis of four flavonoids(5, 6, 9, and 10) and one xanthone (7) containing one or more acetoglycosidemoieties was carried out. Acetyl groups were introduced using acetic anhydrideand microwave irradiation. The introduction of one or two acetoglycoside moietiesin the framework of 3,7-dihydroxyflavone (4) was performed using two syntheticmethods: the Michael reaction and the Koenigs-Knorr reaction. The in vitro cellgrowth inhibitory activity of compounds 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 was investigated insix human tumor cell lines: A375-C5 (malignant melanoma IL-1 insensitive), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer), U251(glioblastoma astrocytoma), U373 (glioblastoma astrocytoma), and U87MG(glioblastoma astrocytoma). The new flavonoid3-hydroxy-7-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-&beta;-glucopyranosyl) flavone (10) was themost potent compound in all tumor cell lines tested, with GI50 values < 8 &mu;Mand a notable degree of selectivity for cancer cells.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23051093 PMID: 29734739
