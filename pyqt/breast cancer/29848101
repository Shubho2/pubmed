[Epubahead of print]Theranostic nanoparticles based on magnetic nanoparticles: design, preparation,characterization, and evaluation as novel anticancer drug carrier and MRIcontrast agent.Nosrati H(1)(2), Salehiabar M(3), Kheiri Manjili H(4), Davaran S(5), DanafarH(1)(3).Author information: (1)a Student Research Center , Zanjan University of Medical Sciences , Zanjan ,Iran.(2)b Department of Pharmaceutical Biomaterials, School of Pharmacy , ZanjanUniversity of Medical Sciences , Zanjan , Iran.(3)c Department of Medicinal Chemistry , School of Pharmacy, Zanjan University ofMedical Sciences , Zanjan , Iran.(4)d Zanjan Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Research Center , Zanjan University ofMedical Sciences , Zanjan , Iran.(5)e Drug Applied Research Center , Tabriz University of Medical Sciences ,Tabriz , Iran.In this work, we reported the synthesis of curcumin (CUR)-loaded hydrophilic and hydrophobic natural amino acids (AAs)-modified iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (IONPs). Two types of AAs, l-lysine (Lys) and l-phenylalanine (PhA), wereselected to study their effects on loading capacity, release profile of CUR,biocompatibility, and anticancer activity. CUR-loaded AAs-modified IONPs(F@AAs@CUR NPs) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. Next, the various kinetic equations were fitted to the release data of CUR fromF@Lys@CUR NPs and F@PhA@CUR NPs. Additionally, hemolysis test and MTT assays onHFF-2 and HEK-293 cell lines were performed for determination of biocompatibilityof AAs-coated IONPs. Finally, the anticancer activity of F@AAs@CUR NPs examinedon MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. The results indicate that these nanocarriersare nontoxic and biocompatible and also F@AAs@CUR NPs are suitable carriers fordelivery of curcumin and even other hydrophobic drugs. Also, the MRI trainingestablished the effectiveness of IONPs as contrast agent for the revealing oftumor as evidenced from the phantom images as well as higher T2 relaxivity.DOI: 10.1080/03639045.2018.1483398 PMID: 29848101
