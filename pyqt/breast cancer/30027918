Sonographic evaluation of axillary LNs innewly diagnosed breast cancer is required to predict prognosis.Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the morphologic features by sonographic evaluation of the cortices and sinuses as well as patterns of bloodflow of axillary LNs and correlate same with the clinical staging in women withnewly diagnosed breast cancer in a tertiary referral centre.Patients and Methods: This was a prospective and descriptive study of 106 newlydiagnosed female breast cancer patients recruited from the surgical outpatientclinic of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, during a period of 9 months in2015. All 106 patients had clinical evaluation, sociodemographic documentationand ultrasound scans of the breast and axillae performed.Results: The mean age of patients was 48.1 (Â±11.1) years with age range 20-82years. Most patients have a negative family history of breast cancer as seen in97 (91.4%) of them. Abnormal cortex-hilum area ratio was more frequent in theright (66.7%) than the left (41.2%) axillary LNs. Longitudinal-transverse ratiowas abnormal in 93.5% and 86.3% of LNs in the right and left axillae,respectively. Slit-like hilum, eccentric cortical thickening, replaced node andrat-bite appearance, respectively, were found in 40.7%, 10.4%, 48.4% and 44.4% ofLNs in the right axilla. The peripheral flow type was demonstrated in 46.8% and48.1% of LNs in the right and left axillae, respectively.Conclusion: Ultrasonography is a good diagnostic tool that can be employed withreasonable accuracy in the initial assessment of axillary involvement in breastcancer. Although the assessment of tumour size and clinical staging leaves littledoubt as to the stage of breast cancer disease, sonographic evaluation of thebreast and the axilla painted a more ominous picture.DOI: 10.4103/npmj.npmj_74_18 PMID: 30027918
