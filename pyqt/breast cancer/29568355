Disruption in mitochondrialdynamics plays a role in cancer. Therefore, proteins involved in regulatingmitochondrial dynamics are potential targets for treatment. mDIVI1 is aninhibitor of the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1, which induces i)mitochondrial oxidative stress and ii) effectively reduces mitochondrialmetabolism. We show here that mDIVI1 is able to inhibit 3D tumorsphere formingcapacity, cell migration and stemness-related signalling in breast cancer cells, indicating that mDIVI1 can potentially be used for the therapeutic elimination ofcancer stem cells (CSCs).DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24285 PMCID: PMC5862576PMID: 29568355
