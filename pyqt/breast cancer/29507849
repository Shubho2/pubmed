Breast cancer patients, particularly those withadvantageous disease characteristics, may achieve extended survival. Thisextended life expectancy highlights the importance of effective intracranialtreatments that minimize treatment-related late toxicity. Whole brain radiationtherapy (WBRT) remains a standard of care palliative option; however, concernsremain regarding the late neurocognitive effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)provides dose-escalated radiation therapy over a shortened course, maintainingequivalent survivalÂ and minimizing normal brain tissue exposure. Herein, wepresent a breast cancer patient who demonstrated an exceptional response andremained functionally independent following 12 SRS courses targeting 14 uniquebrain metastases over eight years. The case illustrates the efficacy of SRSalone, as well as the comparable utility of multiple SRS treatment techniques(Gamma Knife (AB Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden), CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale,California), and TrueBeam (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, California)).DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2001 PMCID: PMC5832406PMID: 29507849
