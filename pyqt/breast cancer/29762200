The consensus recommendations will assist healthcare providers in managing GSM with a goal of improving the care and quality of life for thesewomen. The Expert Consensus Panel is comprised of a diverse group of 16multidisciplinary experts well respected in their fields. The panelistsindividually conducted an evidence-based review of the literature in theirrespective areas of expertise. They then met to discuss the latest treatmentoptions for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in survivors of breastcancer and review management strategies for GSM in women with or at high risk forbreast cancer, using a modified Delphi method. This iterative process involvedpresentations summarizing the current literature, debate, and discussion ofdivergent opinions concerning GSM assessment and management, leading to thedevelopment of consensus recommendations for the clinician.Genitourinary syndromeof menopause is more prevalent in survivors of breast cancer, is commonlyundiagnosed and untreated, and may have early onset because of cancer treatments or risk-reducing strategies. The paucity of evidence regarding the safety ofvaginal hormone therapies in women with or at high risk for breast cancer hasresulted in avoidance of treatment, potentially adversely affecting quality oflife and intimate relationships. Factors influencing decision-making regardingtreatment for GSM include breast cancer recurrence risk, severity of symptoms,response to prior therapies, and personal preference.We review current evidencefor various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic modalities in womenwith a history of or at high risk for breast cancer and highlight the substantialgaps in the evidence for safe and effective therapies and the need for futureresearch. Treatment of GSM is individualized, with nonhormone treatmentsgenerally being first line in this population. The use of local hormone therapiesmay be an option for some women who fail nonpharmacologic and nonhormonetreatments after a discussion of risks and benefits and review with a woman'soncologist. We provide consensus recommendations for an approach to themanagement of GSM in specific patient populations, including women at high riskfor breast cancer, women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers, womenwith triple-negative breast cancers, and women with metastatic disease.DOI: 10.1097/GME.0000000000001121 PMID: 29762200
