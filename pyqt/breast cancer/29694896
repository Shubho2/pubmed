Aging human mammary tissueshows skewed progenitor cell potency, resulting in diminished tumor-suppressivecell types and the accumulation of defective epithelial progenitors. Quantitativecharacterization of these age-emergent human cell subpopulations is lacking,impeding our understanding of the relationship between age and cancersusceptibility. We conducted single-cell resolution proteomic phenotyping ofhealthy breast epithelia from 57 women, aged 16-91 years, using mass cytometry.Remarkable heterogeneity was quantified within the two mammary epitheliallineages. Population partitioning identified a subset of aberrant basal-likeluminal cells that accumulate with age and originate from age-alteredprogenitors. Quantification of age-emergent phenotypes enabled robustclassification of breast tissues by age in healthy women. This high-resolutionmapping highlighted specific epithelial subpopulations that change with age in a manner consistent with increased susceptibility to breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
