The goals of thisstudy were to: (1) determine age at menarche from multiple reports of parents andadolescent participants in a prospective study; (2) examine factors affecting ageat menarche; and (3) determine correlates of menarche and pubertal tempo.DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study.SETTING: Three sites of the Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program.PARTICIPANTS: Girls enrolled at 6-8 years of age.INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parental and participant reported age ofmenarche, and tempo of puberty.RESULTS: There were 946 girls who were assigned an age of menarche. Thecorrelation between parent and participant reports was high (Spearman R = 0.799, P < .001), and the difference was insignificant. Median age at menarche overallwas 12.25 years. Compared with black participants, Hispanic girls were morelikely to have menarche earlier, whereas white and Asian girls were more likelyto have menarche later. Age of menarche was highly correlated with age of breast development (Spearman R = 0.547; P < .001), and inversely with body mass index(Spearman R = -0.403; P < .001). Tempo (interval of age of breast development to menarche) was slower in those with earlier breast development.CONCLUSION: Parental and adolescent reports of menarche are highly correlated.Earlier breast maturation was associated with slower tempo through puberty. Body mass index had a greater effect on age at menarche than did race and ethnicity.Copyright © 2018 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology. Published by Elsevier Inc.
