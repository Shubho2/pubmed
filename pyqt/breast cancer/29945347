[Epub ahead of print]LncRNA GACAT3 predicts poor prognosis and promotes cell proliferation in breastcancer through regulation of miR-497/CCND2.Zhong H(1)(2), Yang J(3), Zhang B(2), Wang X(2), Pei L(2), Zhang L(2), Lin Z(2), Wang Y(2), Wang C(1).Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Laboratory, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing100853, China.(2)Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of XinxiangMedical University, Weihui 453100, Henan, China.(3)Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang MedicalUniversity, Weihui 453100, Henan, China.Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women which increases graduallyall over the world. LncRNA GACAT3 has been found to be increased in gastriccancer and associated with tumor malignancy. However, whether GACAT3 plays a rolein the regulation of breast cancer is not known. In the present study, we foundthat GACAT3 expression was increased in breast cancer tissues and cells compared with adjacent normal tissues and normal cells. High GACAT3 expression wascorrelated with the poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. GACAT3 and cyclinD2 (CCND2) contained a binding site of miR-497. miR-497 was decreased in breastcancer tissues and cells compared with adjacent normal tissues and normal cells. Low miR-497 expression was correlated with the poor prognosis of breast cancerpatients. In breast cancer tissues, the expression of miR-497 was negativelycorrelated with GACAT3. Downregulation of GACAT3 increased miR-497 expression.miR-497 mimic reduced the luciferase of GACAT3 and CCND2. Anti-miR-497 reversedthe effects of GACAT3 downregulation. We also found that GACAT3 may act as aceRNA for miR-497, enhancing the expression of CCND2. In conclusion, GACAT3promotes breast cancer malignancy by sponging miR-497, leading to the enhancementof its endogenous target CCND2. These results suggest that GACAT3/miR-497/CCND2is a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-181354 PMID: 29945347
