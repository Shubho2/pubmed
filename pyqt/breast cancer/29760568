This study further investigated association of thesemutations with clinicopathological characteristics from patients with papillarythyroid carcinoma (PTC).Methods: Tumor tissues from 342 PTC patients were obtained for DNA extraction andpolymerase chain reaction amplification to detect the BRAFV600E mutation usingamplification-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction. TERT promotermutations were assessed using Sanger DNA sequencing. The association of thesegene mutations with clinicopathological characteristics was then statisticallyanalyzed.Results: Two hundred and seventy of 342 (78.9%) PTC patients harbored theBRAFV600E mutation, which was associated with older age male patients. Moreover, TERT promoter mutations occurred in 12 of 342 (3.5 %) PTC patients, all of whomalso had the BRAF mutation. One hundred thirty-three patients with papillarythyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) had no TERT mutations. Statistically, thecoexistence of BRAF and TERT promoter mutations were significantly associatedwith older age, larger tumor size, extrathyroidal extension, and advanced tumorstage, but not with central lymph node metastasis, lateral lymph node metastasis,numbers of lymph node metastasis >5, and numbers of involved/harvested lymphnodes (No. of LNs involved or harvested). The multivariate analyses showed older age (odds ratio [OR], 2.194; 95% CI: 1.117-4.311; p=0.023), larger tumor size(OR, 4.100; 95% CI: 2.257-7.450; p<0.001), and multiplicity (OR, 2.240; 95% CI:1.309-3.831; p=0.003) were all independent predictors for high prevalence ofextrathyroidal extension. However, there was no statistical association with any clinicopathological characteristics except for Hashimoto thyroiditis in PTMC.Conclusion: The current study demonstrated that the coexistence of BRAF and TERT promoter mutations were associated with the PTC aggressiveness, although thesemutations were not associated with PTC lymph node metastasis or with PTMC.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S159583 PMCID: PMC5937490PMID: 29760568
