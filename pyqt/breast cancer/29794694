As breast cancer patientsundergoing microsurgical breast reconstruction are often receiving hormonetherapy, it is unclear whether this increased thrombotic risk is associated with increased flap loss.METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on patients undergoing abdominally based microsurgical breast reconstruction at an academic institution from 2004 to2015. Patients were divided by use of hormone therapy at the time of surgery.Complication rates, including complete or partial flap loss and overallcomplications, were compared and analyzed using univariate and logisticregression models.RESULTS: Among a total of 853 patients (1253 flaps), 193 patients (269 flaps)were receiving hormone therapy and 660 patients (984 flaps) were not. Patients onhormone therapy had higher rates of previous breast surgery, advanced cancerstage, chemoradiation before reconstruction, and delayed and unilateralreconstruction. There were no statistically significant differences betweenhormone therapy patients and nontherapy patients in complete flap loss (1.0percent versus 1.1 percent) and partial flap loss (2.2 percent versus 1.5percent). Hypertension and previous breast surgery were the only independent riskfactors for minor complications (adjusted OR, 2.1; 95 percent CI, 1.3 to 3.6; p =0.005; and adjusted OR, 1.8; 95 percent CI, 1.2 to 2.7; p = 0.009, respectively) and overall complications (adjusted OR, 2.2; 95 percent CI, 1.3 to 3.7; p =0.004; and adjusted OR, 1.9; 95 percent CI, 1.3 to 3.0; p = 0.003, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Hormone therapy was not associated with a higher incidence ofcomplete or partial flap loss or overall complications. The authors propose anindividualized approach to the preoperative cessation of tamoxifen or aromataseinhibitors.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004359 PMID: 29794694
