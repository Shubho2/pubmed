We recently showed that a nuclear envelope protein, Sad1 andUNC84 domain protein 1 (SUN1), a component of the LINC complex, has a criticalfunction in cell migration. Although ionizing radiation activates cell migration and invasion in vivo and in vitro, the underlying molecular mechanism remainsunknown. Here, we examined the involvement of the LINC complex inradiation-enhanced cell migration and invasion. A sublethal dose of X-rayradiation promoted human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion,whereas carbon ion beam radiation suppressed these processes in a dose-dependent manner. Depletion of SUN1 and SUN2 significantly suppressed X-ray-enhanced cellmigration and invasion. Moreover, depletion or overexpression of each SUN1splicing variant revealed that SUN1_888 containing 888 amino acids of SUN1 butnot SUN1_916 was required for X-ray-enhanced migration and invasion. In addition,the results suggested that X-ray irradiation affected the expression level ofSUN1 splicing variants and a SUN protein binding partner, nesprins. Takentogether, our findings supported that the LINC complex contributed tophoton-enhanced cell migration and invasion.© 2018 The Authors.
