The results areinconsistent so that we performed a meta-analysis of current literature toclarify the impacts of these polymorphisms on gynecological cancer.METHODS: Eligible articles were identified through an exhaustive search ofrelevant databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of science, Springer Link,Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Weipu database for theperiod up to July 2016. Data about the association between single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) and cancer risk were refined from the selected articles aswell as other information about cases and controls, and all of them wereextracted by 2 independent researchers and pooled odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was calculated.RESULTS: This analysis included 24 articles, 27 case-control studies of rs2279744polymorphism and 3 case-control studies of rs117039649 polymorphism. Significant association with the risk of gynecological cancer was observed for both SNPs.Subgroup analysis by ethnicity and cancer type (cervical, ovarian, breast, andendometrial) also showed a positive relationship between rs2279744 polymorphismand gynecological cancer risk in Caucasian; and there was also a notableassociation between rs2279744 polymorphism and cervical cancer.CONCLUSIONS: We found that rs2279744 (SNP309) and rs117039649 (SNP285) were both associated with the risk of gynecological cancers. Subgroup analysis showed that rs2279744 (SNP309) was associated with the risk of gynecological cancers inCaucasian and Asian according to the ethnicity and cancer type, especially forendometrial cancer.Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors.
