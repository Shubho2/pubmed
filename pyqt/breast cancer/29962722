The most common site of metastatic deposit to parotid gland is from squamous cell malignancies of head and neck, while secondarydeposits from primary in infraclavicular location are very rarely described. Weherein describe the case of an elderly lady who while on adjuvant endocrinetherapy developed metastatic disease with right intraparotid node as the solesite of metastasis detected on FDG PET scan. This type of presentation ofrecurrence is very uncommon, especially in hormonal receptor-positive cases, with<30 cases described in the literature to the best of our knowledge. This patient underwent metastasectomy followed by palliative the second-line hormonal therapy and achieved long-term survival more than usually seen with other metastaticbreast cancers highlighting the importance of metastasectomy in metastatic breastcancer patients on hormonal therapy who develop metachronous oligometastaticdisease.DOI: 10.4103/ijnm.IJNM_17_18 PMCID: PMC6011557PMID: 29962722
