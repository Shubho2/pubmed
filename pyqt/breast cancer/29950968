This year's contents focused verymuch on new developments in the treatment of ABC. For example, the significanceof inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) in hormone receptor(HR)-positive ABC, of dual antibody blockade in human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 (HER2)-positive ABC, and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)inhibition in triple-negative ABC, as well as the potential therapeuticconsequences, were discussed. Other key issues were BRCA-associated breastcancer, treatment of brain metastases, and personalized therapy decision-makingusing molecular testing (so-called 'precision medicine'). As in past years, animportant objective of the ABC conference was cooperation with representatives ofpatient organizations from around the world. This cooperation was furtherintensified during the ABC4. Following the main conference, the 'Global Alliance'was founded, with the goal of publicizing and coordinating measures necessaryworldwide from the patient advocates' standpoint. - The ABC consensus inevitably cannot accommodate country-specific needs, due to the truly global expert panel. Therefore, a working group of German breast cancer experts commented - as in the past years - on the on-site voting results by the ABC panelists upon which thefinal ABC4 consensus will be based, with particular consideration of the Germanguidelines on diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer for everyday treatment in Germany.DOI: 10.1159/000486722 PMCID: PMC6016060 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29950968
