The androgenreceptor (AR) is proposed as a therapeutic target for AR-positive advancedtriple-negative breast cancer. We herein investigated the effects of a treatment with antiandrogens on the functional activity, activation kinetics,transcriptional expression, and protein degradation of KCa1.1 in human breastcancer MDA-MB-453 cells using real-time PCR, Western blotting, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, and whole-cell patch clamp recording. A treatment with theantiandrogen bicalutamide or enzalutamide for 48 h significantly suppressed (1)depolarization responses induced by paxilline (PAX), a specific KCa1.1 blockerand (2) PAX-sensitive outward currents induced by the depolarizing voltage step. The expression levels of KCa1.1 transcripts and proteins were significantlydecreased in MDA-MB-453 cells, and the protein degradation of KCa1.1 mainlycontributed to reductions in KCa1.1 activity. Among the eight regulatory β and γ subunits, LRRC26 alone was expressed at high levels in MDA-MB-453 cells andprimary and metastatic breast cancer tissues, whereas no significant changes wereobserved in the expression levels of LRRC26 and activation kinetics ofPAX-sensitive outward currents in MDA-MB-453 cells by the treatment withantiandrogens. The treatment with antiandrogens up-regulated the expression ofthe ubiquitin E3 ligases, FBW7, MDM2, and MDM4 in MDA-MB-453 cells, and theprotein degradation of KCa1.1 was significantly inhibited by the respectivesiRNA-mediated blockade of FBW7 and MDM2. Based on these results, we concludedthat KCa1.1 is an androgen-responsive gene in AR-positive breast cancer cells,and its down-regulation through enhancements in its protein degradation by FBW7and/or MDM2 may contribute, at least in part, to the antiproliferative andantimetastatic effects of antiandrogens in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2018.00312 PMCID: PMC5911984PMID: 29713287
