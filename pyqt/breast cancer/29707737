Recent studies,however, suggest that women with early stage breast cancer are more likely to dieof cardiovascular disease than recurrent breast cancer. Estrogen antagonists havebeen shown to reduce endothelial function, to increase lipid profiles and toalter body composition accelerating atherosclerotic changes. While clinical trialdata demonstrates mixed results of the impact of estrogen antagonists oncardiovascular risk, there is a growing body of evidence that estrogensuppression and estrogen antagonists result in biologic effects on theendothelium, altering lipid profiles and accelerating the risk ofatherosclerosis. Further longitudinal work however is needed.DOI: 10.1007/s11936-018-0637-8 PMID: 29707737
