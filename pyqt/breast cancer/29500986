Kairos in familial communication onhereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk.Derbez B(1).Author information: (1)LABERS, Université de Bretagne Occidentale, 22 boulevard Camille Desmoulins,29238 Brest, France. Electronic address: bderbez@gmail.com.Time has long been considered as an important dimension of the process ofdisclosure of information about genetic risk to kin. The question of the "righttime to tell" has been frequently noticed but seldom placed at the centre of the analyses of social scientists. Based on an ethnographical fieldwork in a Frenchcancer genetics clinic, this article aims to show that many dimensions of thepractical issues of disclosure to family can be fruitfully addressed through the temporal lens of kairos. Relying on the case of hereditary breast and ovariancancer risk, it firstly highlights the existence of a mismatch between the"chronological" time of prevention proposed by professionals and the"kairological" time of disclosure lived by informants. Secondly, it emphasizesthe problematic nature of the pragmatic approach of time associated with kairos. On the one hand one can draw some benefits from seeking the right time to inform relatives, but on the other hand waiting on uncertain opportunities to disclosesuch information can make communication even more difficult.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
