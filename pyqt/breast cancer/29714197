Boone in 2012. Here,use of X-ray synchrotron radiation for image guided external beam rotationalradiotherapy treatment of breast cancer is proposed. Tumor irradiation occurswith the patient in the prone position hosted on a rotating bed, with her breast hanging from a hole in the bed, which rotates around a vertical axis passingthrough the tumor site. Horizontal collimation of the X-ray beam provides forwhole breast or partial breast irradiation, while vertical translation of the bedand successive rotations allow for irradiation of the full tumor volume, withdose rates which permit also hypofractionated treatments. In this work, whichfollows a previous preliminary report, results are shown of a full series ofmeasurements on polyethylene and acrylic cylindrical phantoms carried out at the Australian Synchrotron, confirmed by Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations, intended to demonstrate the proof of principle of the technique. Dose measurements werecarried out with calibrated ion chambers, radiochromic films andthermoluminescence dosimeters. The photon energy investigated was 60 keV. Imageguidance may occur with the transmitted beam for contrast-enhanced breastcomputed tomography. For a horizontal beam collimation of 1.5 cm and rotationaround the central axis of a 14 cm-diameter polyethylene phantom, aperiphery-to-center dose ratio of 14% was measured. The simulations showed thatunder the same conditions the dose ratio decreases with increasing photon energy down to 10% at 175 keV. These values are comparable with those achievable withconventional megavoltage radiotherapy of breast cancer with a medical linearaccelerator. Dose painting was demonstrated with two off-center `cancer foci'with 1.3 Gy and 0.6 Gy target doses. The use of a radiosensitizing agent for doseenhancement is foreseen.DOI: 10.1107/S1600577518003788 PMID: 29714197
