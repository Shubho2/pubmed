In this study, the potential of B. subtilis lipopeptides (amixture of iturin homologues, concentration of 42.75%) to inhibit chronicmyelogenous leukemia was evaluated using K562 myelogenous leukemia cells. Theresults showed that the lipopeptides could completely inhibit the growth of K562 at 100 μM, with an IC50 value of 65.76 μM. The lipopeptides inhibited the profileof K562 via three pathways: (1) induction of paraptosis indicated by theoccurrence of cytoplasmic vacuoles, and swelling of the mitochondria andendoplasmic reticulum (ER) without membrane blebbing in the presence of a caspaseinhibitor; (2) inhibition of autophagy progress illustrated by the upregulatedexpression of LCII and P62; and (3) induction of apoptosis by causing ROS burst, and induction of the intrinsic pathway indicated by the upregulated expression ofcytochrome c (Cyto-c), bax, and bad, together with downregulated expression ofBcl-2. The ROS-dependent apoptosis and caspase-independent paraptosis wereverified using the ROS inhibitor and caspase inhibitor, respectively. Theextrinsic apoptosis pathway was not involved in the lipopeptide's effects onK562. Overall, the B. subtilis lipopeptides (consisting of a majority of iturin) exhibited promising potential in inhibiting chronic myelogenous leukemia in vitrovia simultaneously causing paraptosis, apoptosis, and inhibition of autophagy.DOI: 10.1186/s13568-018-0606-3 PMCID: PMC5959823PMID: 29777449
