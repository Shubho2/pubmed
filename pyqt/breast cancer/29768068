[Epub aheadof print]Population-level study links short-wavelength nighttime illumination with breast cancer incidence in a major metropolitan area.Rybnikova N(1), Portnov BA(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Management , University ofHaifa , Haifa , Israel.Several population-level studies revealed a positive association between breastcancer (BC) incidence and artificial light at night (ALAN) exposure. However, theeffect of short-wavelength illumination, implicated by laboratory research andsmall-scale cohort studies as the main driving force behind BC-ALAN association, has not been supported by any population-level study carried out to date. Weinvestigated a possible link between BC and ALAN of different subspectra using a multi-spectral year-2011 satellite image, taken from the International SpaceStation, and superimposing it with year-2013 BC incidence data available for the Great Haifa Metropolitan Area in Israel. The analysis was performed using bothordinary least square (OLS) and spatial dependency models, controlling forsocioeconomic and locational attributes of the study area. The study revealedstrong associations between BC and blue and green light subspectra(B = 0.336 ± 0.001 and B = 0.335 ± 0.002, respectively; p < 0.01), compared to a somewhat weaker effect for the red subspectrum (B = 0.056 ± 0.001; p < 0.01).However, spatial dependency models, controlling for spatial autocorrelation ofregression residuals, confirmed only a positive association between BC incidence and short-wavelength (blue) ALAN subspectrum (z = 2.462, p < 0.05) whilereporting insignificant associations between BC and either green (z = 1.425,p > 0.1) or red (z = -0.604, p > 0.1) subspectra. The obtained result is in line with the results of laboratory- and small-scale cohort studies linkingshort-wavelength nighttime illumination with circadian disruption and melatoninsuppression. The detected effect of blue lights on BC incidence may help todevelop informed illumination policies aimed at minimizing the adverse healtheffects of ALAN exposure on human health.DOI: 10.1080/07420528.2018.1466802 PMID: 29768068
