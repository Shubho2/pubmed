However, resistance to endocrine therapies iscommon in 30% of cases, which may be due to altered ERα signaling and/or enhancedplasticity of cancer cells leading to breast cancer subtype conversion. Themechanisms leading to enhanced plasticity of ERα-positive cancer cells areunknown.METHODS: We used short hairpin (sh)RNA and/or the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knockdownthe expression of the dependence receptor UNC5A in ERα+ MCF7 and T-47D celllines. RNA-seq, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,chromatin immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were used to measure theeffect of UNC5A knockdown on basal and estradiol (E2)-regulated gene expression. Mammosphere assay, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence were used to determine the role of UNC5A in restricting plasticity. Xenograft models were used tomeasure the effect of UNC5A knockdown on tumor growth and metastasis. Tissuemicroarray and immunohistochemistry were utilized to determine the prognosticvalue of UNC5A in breast cancer. Log-rank test, one-way, and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical analyses.RESULTS: Knockdown of the E2-inducible UNC5A resulted in altered basal geneexpression affecting plasma membrane integrity and ERα signaling, as evident fromligand-independent activity of ERα, altered turnover of phosphorylated ERα,unique E2-dependent expression of genes effecting histone demethylase activity,enhanced upregulation of E2-inducible genes such as BCL2, and E2-independenttumorigenesis accompanied by multiorgan metastases. UNC5A depletion led to theappearance of a luminal/basal hybrid phenotype supported by elevated expressionof basal/stem cell-enriched ∆Np63, CD44, CD49f, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and the lymphatic vessel permeability factor NTN4, but lower expressionof luminal/alveolar differentiation-associated ELF5 while maintaining functional ERα. In addition, UNC5A-depleted cells acquired bipotent luminal progenitorcharacteristics based on KRT14+/KRT19+ and CD49f+/EpCAM+ phenotype. Consistentwith in vitro results, UNC5A expression negatively correlated with EGFRexpression in breast tumors, and lower expression of UNC5A, particularly inERα+/PR+/HER2- tumors, was associated with poor outcome.CONCLUSION: These studies reveal an unexpected role of the axon guidance receptorUNC5A in fine-tuning ERα and EGFR signaling and the luminal progenitor status of hormone-sensitive breast cancers. Furthermore, UNC5A knockdown cells provide anideal model system to investigate metastasis of ERα+ breast cancers.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0963-5 PMCID: PMC5932758PMID: 29720215
