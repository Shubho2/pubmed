However, the series of pathophysiologic eventsby which CTC clusters originate, enter the circulation, and reach the distantsites remain to be identified. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that providesurvival advantage for CTC clusters during the transit in the blood stream arealso still largely unknown. Understanding the biology of CTC clusters is criticalto assess this unified scheme employed by cancer and to device strategies toovercome key pathways responsible for their improved metastatic potential. CTCclusters remain an underdeveloped area of research begging the attention ofmultidisciplinary cancer research teams. Here, we provide insight on existingpreclinical evidence on the potential mechanisms leading to CTC cluster formationand dissemination and on processes that may offer survival advantage. We alsooffer our perspective on future directions to delineate the role of CTC clusters in metastatic cascade and discuss their clinical significance.
