Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a significant role in tissueremodeling related to various processes such as morphogenesis, angiogenesis,tissue repair, invasion, and metastasis. We investigated the effects of PPARγ on MMP expression and invasion in breast cancer cells.Methods: MCF-7 cells were cultured and then cell viability was monitored in anMTT assay. Western blotting, gelatin zymography, real-time polymerase chainreaction, and luciferase assays were performed to investigate the effect of thesynthetic PPARγ ligand troglitazone on MMP expression. Transcription factor DNAbinding was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. A Matrigel invasionassay was used to assess the effects of troglitazone on MCF-7 cells.Results: Troglitazone did not affect MCF-7 cell viability.12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced MMP-9 expression and invasion in MCF-7 cell. However, these effects were decreased by troglitazone. TPAincreased nuclear factor κB and activator protein-1 DNA binding, whiletroglitazone inhibited these effects. The selective PPARγ antagonist GW9662reversed MMP-9 inhibition by troglitazone in TPA-treated MCF-7 cells.Conclusion: Troglitazone inhibited nuclear factor κB and activatorprotein-1-mediated MMP-9 expression and invasion of MCF-7 cells through aPPARγ-dependent mechanism.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.1.28 PMCID: PMC5880963PMID: 29628981
