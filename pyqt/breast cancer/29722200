We performed aretrospective study of ED presentations in patients receiving curativechemotherapy for early breast cancer to identify factors contributing to EDpresentations. Of 102 patients, 39 (38%) presented to ED within 30 days ofchemotherapy, resulting in 63 ED presentations in total. Most common reasons werenon-neutropenic fever (17 presentations/27%), neutropenic fever (15/24%), pain(9/14%), drug reaction (6/10%) and infection (4/6%). Factors significantlyassociated with ED presentation were adjuvant chemotherapy timing compared toneoadjuvant timing (P = 0.031), prophylactic antibiotics (P = 0.045) anddocetaxel-containing regimen (P = 0.018).Â© 2018 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.DOI: 10.1111/imj.13785 PMID: 29722200
