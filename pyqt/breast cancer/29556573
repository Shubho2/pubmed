This study evaluated the rate of grade ≥2 dermatitis andmoist desquamation (MD) in patients with a high BMI who were treated to thebreast or chest wall to understand the role of radiation target, fractionationregimen, and BMI.Methods and materials: We retrospectively evaluated 280 patients treated withadjuvant radiation for breast cancer after up-front surgery. We collectedinformation on patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, andacute skin toxicities. Multiple logistic regression models were used to evaluate for predictors of grade ≥2 dermatitis and MD.Results: Patients undergoing post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) had thehighest rate of MD (24%). The rate was lower (8.7%) among lumpectomy patients,but those receiving conventional fractionation had a higher rate of MD (10.9%)compared with hypofractionated therapy (1.8%; P = .05). Among lumpectomypatients, chemotherapy use (odds ratio, 3.74; P = .04) and regional nodalirradiation (odds ratio, 3.29; P = .03) were also significant predictors of MD.Despite an elevated average BMI among lumpectomy patients, hypofractionatedtherapy resulted in lower rates of skin toxicity.Conclusions: We identified multiple risk factors for acute skin toxicity,including the use of PMRT and conventionally fractionated regimens. Elevated BMI,regional nodal irradiation, and chemotherapy use were associated with anincreased risk of MD. Our findings highlight the need to explore the use of less toxic hypofractionated regimens in patients who are at the highest risk of acute skin toxicity, including those with a higher BMI and those receiving PMRT.DOI: 10.1016/j.adro.2017.10.007 PMCID: PMC5856985PMID: 29556573
