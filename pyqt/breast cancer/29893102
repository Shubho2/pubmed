Mammography screening has been thesubject of scientific debate, but there has been little research on the politicalarguments for a public screening programme. In this article I analyse thearguments put forward at that time for nationwide mammography screening.MATERIAL AND METHOD: A document analysis of proposals to the Storting wasperformed, and recommendations and minutes of debates in the Storting that dealt with nationwide mammography screening. The documents are from the periodFebruary-June 1998.RESULTS: The Storting was unanimously in favour of introducing a nationwidebreast cancer screening programme. The debate consisted of four main lines ofargument: 'breast cancer mortality and the effect of mammography screening','women's health', 'justice and equality of healthcare services', and that'private service providers offer the solution for insufficient equipment andpersonnel'. The effect of mammography screening on breast cancer mortalitypermeated the debate. Problematic aspects of screening were not discussed.INTERPRETATION: The fact that early detection affects breast cancer mortality wasan underlying premise in the debate on nationwide mammography screening in theStorting in 1998. Since its introduction, mammography screening has been thesubject of scientific debate. This has not undermined the political will tomaintain the mammography programme, and the introduction of a new screeningprogramme for colon cancer has now been adopted.DOI: 10.4045/tidsskr.17.1049 PMID: 29893102
