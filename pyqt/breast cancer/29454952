Electronic address:c.sudarsan.mgu@gmail.com.6-Gingerol [5-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) decan-3-one], the bio-active ingredient of the popular Indian spice ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe), iswell-known for its pharmacological and physiological actions. The potentantioxidant, antiemetic, antiulcer, antimicrobial, analgesic, hypoglycemic,antihypertensive, antihyperlipidemic, immunostimulant, anti-inflammatory,cardiotonic, and cancer prevention activities of 6-Gingerol has been investigatedand explored. 6-Gingerol is a good candidate for the treatment of various cancersincluding prostrate, pancreatic, breast, skin, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, andrenal cancer. In this study we report for the first time the molecularrecognition of 6-Gingerol with calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) through experimental andmolecular modeling techniques confirming a minor groove binding mode of6-Gingerol with ctDNA. Fluorescence and UV-vis spectroscopic studies confirm the complex formation of 6-gingerol with ctDNA. The energetics and thermodynamics of the interaction of 6-Gingerol with ctDNA was explored by Isothermal TitrationCalorimetry (ITC) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The ctDNA helixmelting upon 6-Gingerol binding was examined by melting temperature Tm analysis. Further the electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirms a possible groovebinding of 6-Gingerol with ctDNA. Molecular docking and Molecular dynamics (MD)studies provide a detailed understanding on the interaction of 6-Gingerol bindingin the minor groove of DNA which supports experimental results.Copyright Â© 2018.
