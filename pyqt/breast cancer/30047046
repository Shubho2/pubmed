[Epub ahead ofprint]CAP2 is a Valuable Biomarker for Diagnosis and Prognostic in Patients withGastric Cancer.Li L(1)(2), Fu LQ(1)(2), Wang HJ(1)(2), Wang YY(3)(4).Author information: (1)Clinical Research Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People'sHospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, 310014, China.(2)Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang, Hangzhou,China.(3)Key Laboratory of Gastroenterology of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang, Hangzhou,China. lywyy1979@126.com.(4)Department of Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Surgery, Zhejiang ProvincialPeople's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Zhejiang,Hangzhou, China. lywyy1979@126.com.Cyclase-associated protein 2 (CAP2) protein is reported to be upregulated inhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), human breast cancer, and malignant melanoma.However, its expression in gastric cancer remains unknown, this study was toinvestigate CAP2 expression and its prognostic significance in gastric cancer.Firstly, we analyzed the Oncomine databases to compare CAP2 mRNA expression ingastric cancer and normal tissues. CAP2 protein expression was analyzed ingastric cancer samples and non-tumor mucosa by RT-PCR and immunohistochemicalanalysis. Consequently, statistical analyses were performed to evaluate theclinicopathological significance of CAP2 expression in gastric cancer. CAP2expression was significant higher in gastric cancer tissues than that innon-tumor mucosa at protein levels. CAP2 was up-regulated in 57.8% (252/436) ofgastric cancer samples, while detected in only 10.9% (10/92) of non-tumor mucosa.Statistical analysis shows that the expression of CAP2 was correlated with tumor size, Lauren's classification, depth of invasion, lymph node and distantmetastases, and regional lymph node stage, TNM stage, but not with age, sex,histology classification, and histologic differentiation. Kaplan-Meier analysisindicated that high CAP2 expression was associated with poor overall survival(78.7%) in 203 of 252 gastic cancer patients. In stage I, II, and III tumors, the5-year survival rate was lower in those with high expression of CAP2 than thosewith low expression. In stage IV tumors, the expression of CAP2 did not correlatewith the 5-year survival rate. Multiple Cox regression analysis indicated CAP2 asan independent predictor for overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.045, 95%confidence interval: 1.445-2.895, p < 0.01], while Lauren's classification, TNMstage, and expression of CAP2 were independent prognostic factors in patientswith gastric cancer. For the first time, we found that CAP2 was upregulated ingastic cancer, and was associated with lymph node and distant metastases. CAP2may serve as a prognostic indicator for patients with gastic cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s12253-018-0450-4 PMID: 30047046
