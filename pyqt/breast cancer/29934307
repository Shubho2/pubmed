The lipid-repair enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) protects against this oxidative damage and enables cells to resistferroptosis. Recent work has revealed that matrix-detached carcinoma cells can besusceptible to ferroptosis and that they can evade this fate through thesignaling properties of the α6β4 integrin, which sustains GPX4 expression.Although these findings on ferroptosis are provocative, they differ from those inprevious studies indicating that matrix-detached cells are prone to apoptosis,via a process referred to as anoikis. In an effort to reconcile these discrepant findings, here we observed that matrix-detached epithelial and carcinoma cellscluster spontaneously via a mechanism that involves the cell adhesion proteinPVRL4 (also known as Nectin-4). We found that this clustering process allowsthese cells to survive by stimulating a PVRL4/α6β4/Src signaling axis thatsustains GPX4 expression and buffers against lipid peroxidation. In the absenceof α6β4, PVRL4-mediated clustering induced an increase in lipid peroxidation thatwas sufficient for triggering ferroptosis. When the clustering was inhibited,single cells did not exhibit a significant increase in lipid peroxidation in the absence of α6β4, and they were more susceptible to apoptosis than to ferroptosis.These results indicate that ferroptosis induction depends on cell clustering inmatrix-detached cells that lack α6β4 and imply that the fate of matrix-detachedcells can be determined by the state of their cell-cell interactions.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and MolecularBiology, Inc.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.003017 PMID: 29934307
