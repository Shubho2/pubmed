Electronic address: jamialahmadikh@mums.ac.ir.PAX2 (paired box gene 2) is a transcription factor, which is involved in bothcell proliferation and carcinogenesis. This study aimed to investigate PAX2expression in tamoxifen resistant (TAM-R) and tamoxifen sensitive (TAM-S) breast carcinoma patients and analyze its correlation with clinicopathologicalcharacteristics and survival. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed toevaluate PAX2 protein expression in 36 TAM-R and 36 TAM-S formalin-fixedparaffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tumor tissues. Data analysis indicated that PAX2 expression was significantly higher in TAM-S group in comparison to TAM-R(P = 0.014). Overexpression of PAX2 was significantly correlated with perineural invasion (PNI) (P = 0.025). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significantassociation between high expression of PAX2 and better disease-free survival(P < 0.001) and also overall survival (P = 0.031). Multivariate cox regressionanalysis demonstrated that patients with increased expression of PAX2 have atrend toward improved disease free survival (OR = 0.065, 95% CI: 0.009-0.476;P = 0.007) and overall survival (OR = 0.147, 95% CI: 0.020-1.105; P = 0.062). Ourdata suggested that high expression of PAX2 could be associated with bettersurvival in estrogen receptor positive tamoxifen-treated breast carcinomapatients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
