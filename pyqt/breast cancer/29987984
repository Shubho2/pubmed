FDs measured onthesupracortical area above the angulus mandibula (FD2) and anterior to the mentalforamen (FD4) were significantly lower in patients (p = 0.037 and p = 0.046respectively). Among the measured regions in patients, FD2 was significantlylower (p = 0.001). PMI was also significantly lower in patients (p = 0.001) andMCI were similar in both groups (p = 0.604).CONCLUSION: AI use affects bone quality and evaluating FD, PMI, and MCW inpanoramic radiography can be used to determine the effect of this drug on the jawbones in the early period. Advances in knowledge: Aromatase inhibitors are themost commonly used drugs in breast cancer patients. This drug is thought to have osteoporotic effects on the jawbone. This study is the first study to evaluateosteoporotic changes with measurements made on panoramic radiographs and theresults of the study are significant. We think this study will shed light on the studies that will investigate the effects of the drug on the jaw bones.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20180442 PMID: 29987984
