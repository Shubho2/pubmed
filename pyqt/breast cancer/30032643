These receptors areimportant for tumor angiogenesis, and lenvatinib inhibits tumor angiogenesis byinhibiting function of these receptors. Phase I trials of lenvatinib wereconducted at the same time in Japan, Europe, and the United States, and tumorshrinkage effects were observed in thyroid cancer, endometrial cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, sarcoma, and colon cancer. Lenvatinib is a promising drugthat has shown therapeutic effects against various solid tumors. Adverse events, such as hypertension, proteinuria, diarrhea, and delayed wound healing, can occurwith lenvatinib treatment. Managing these adverse events is also important forthe use of lenvatinib. In this mini-review article, we outline the current state,toxicity, and future prospects of lenvatinib toward thyroid cancer,hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and lung cancer.DOI: 10.1177/1073274818789361 PMCID: PMC6056795PMID: 30032643
