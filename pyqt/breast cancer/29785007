Of these, LargeGenomic Rearrangements (LGRs) have been rarely reported; to date only eight LGRs have been published with just the Czech founder mutation, the deletion of exons 9and 10, being molecularly characterized and studied extensively. The presentstudy aimed to molecularly define and determine the contribution of two rare,apparently novel CHEK2 LGRs, among Greek breast cancer patients. Thesespecifically involve a ~6 kb in-frame deletion of exons 2 & 3 that removesCHEK2's FHA domain and a ~7.5 kb in-frame deletion of exon 6, which removes anα-helix of CHEK2's kinase domain. The latter was identified in 5 out of 2355(0.22%) patients tested, while haplotype analysis revealed a commondisease-associated haplotype, suggesting a single common ancestor and a Greekfounder. Although in-frame, this LGR is predicted to be damaging by a yeast-basedfunctional assay and structure-function predictions. The present study highlightsthe existence of rare, population-specific, genomic events in a known breastcancer predisposing gene, which can explain a proportion of hereditary breastcancer. Identification of such mutation carriers is rather important sinceappropriate clinical actionability will be inferred.DOI: 10.1038/s10038-018-0466-3 PMID: 29785007
