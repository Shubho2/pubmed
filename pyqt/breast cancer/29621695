Electronic address: J.korevaar@nivel.nl.An increasing number of women is surviving breast cancer and due to that at risk of developing an isolated ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) or acontralateral breast cancer (CBC). Patients' main concern is cancer recurrence.Patient counseling on breast cancer recurrence is challenging. In order toprovide healthcare professionals and patients more guidance, a systematicliterature review of the incidence of isolated IBTR and CBC in women diagnosedwith early invasive breast cancer was performed. Medline, EMBASE and the CochraneLibrary were searched from 2000 until October 2015. Multicenter studies reportingan IBTR or CBC rate in curatively treated adult females diagnosed with invasivebreast cancer were included. The initial search yielded 6998 potentially relevantarticles. Twenty were eligible for inclusion, representing 25 recurrenceincidence rates. Both isolated IBTR and CBC incidence rates steadily increasedwith the length of follow-up, indicating that IBTR and CBC occur even more than15 years after diagnosis. The annual incidence rate of isolated IBTR and CBC inwomen diagnosed with an early invasive breast cancer was 0.6% (range: 0.4-1.1%)and 0.5% (range: 0.2-0.7%), respectively. Analyzed data were lacking information about important risk factors and given treatment with regard to the incidence of recurrence, which hampers the prediction of patient tailored recurrence risks.The presented rates are therefore the best available estimates of isolated IBTRand CBC annual incidence rates based on the current literature. Healthcareprofessionals could use these rates in their communication with patientsdiagnosed with early invasive breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
