However, when the benefits and risks of mammography are considered, the risk of radiation-induced cancer iscalculated for only the examined breast using Mean Glandular Dose (MGD). The riskfrom radiation during mammography is often described as low or minimal. Thisstudy aims to evaluate the effective lifetime risk from full field digitalmammography (FFDM) for a number of national screening programmes.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using an ATOM phantom, radiation doses to multiple organswere measured during standard screening mammography. Sixteen FFDM machines wereused and the effective lifetime risk was calculated across the female lifespanfor each machine. Once the risks were calculated using the phantom, the totaleffective lifetime risk across 48 national screening programmes was thencalculated; this assumed that all these programmes use FFDM for screening.RESULTS: Large differences exist in effective lifetime risk, varying from 42.21[39.12-45.30] cases/106 (mean [95% CI]) in the Maltese screening programme to1099.67 [1019.25-1180.09] cases/106 for high breast cancer risk women in theUnited States of America. These differences are mainly attributed to thecommencement age of screening mammography and the time interval betweensuccessive screens.CONCLUSIONS: Effective risk should be considered as an additional parameter forthe assessment of screening mammography programme performance, especially forthose programmes which recommend an early onset and more frequent screeningmammography.Copyright Â© 2018 The College of Radiographers.
