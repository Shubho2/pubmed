The cancers classified according to federation international ofObstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO).RESULTS: There were 127 cases of ovarian cancers. Surface epithelial cancers werethe most common 77.7% (n = 98), followed by sex cord-stromal cancers 11.23% (n = 14), Germ cell tumor 1.6% (n = 2). Metastatic cancers were seen from colon andbreast in 6.3% and 3.9 % of cases respectively. Few cases (14%) of ovariancancers were reported before 40 years of age, after the age of 50 is a sharpincrease in the incidence of a tumour. The mean age at presentation was 52.36 ±14.210 years, there is mean age of menarche 13.59 ± 2.706 years. Very fewpatients used HRT (1.6%) or had been on ovulation induction treatment (8.7%).Most of patients 39 (30.7%) presented in stage IIIC, and stage 1V 32 (25.2%)indicating a poor prognosis.CONCLUSION: The incidence of different types of ovarian cancers in the presentstudy is similar to worldwide incidence. The surface epithelial tumour is thecommonest ovarian cancer, of which serous adenocarcinoma is the commonest andmost of our patients present in late stages.DOI: 10.3889/oamjms.2018.067 PMCID: PMC5839424PMID: 29531580
