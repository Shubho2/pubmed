Datafor BC patients diagnosed with CBC were collected from the Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End Results database. CBC incidence was calculated using theKaplan-Meier method and the temporal trend in CBC incidence was assessed usingjoinpoint regression. Survival analysis was calculated using propensity scoring(PS) and multivariate Cox regression with a competing risk model. We found that10,944 of 212,630 patients with early-stage BC were subsequently diagnosed withsecondary BC in the contralateral breast. The 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-yearcumulative CBC incidences were 1.9, 4.6, 7.6, and 10.5%, respectively. Beingyounger (.DOI: 10.3390/jcm7060133 PMCID: PMC6025574PMID: 29857526
