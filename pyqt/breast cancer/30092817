Volumetric BD was measured usingfully automated software. The cumulative incidence of advanced cancer after anegative screening episode (including stage II or more severe cancer during thescreening interval - on average 28 months - and at the subsequent round) wascalculated separately for Volpara density grade (VDG) categories.RESULTS: BC incidence gradually increased with the increas in BD: 3.7‰, 5.1‰,5.4‰ and 9.1‰ in the VDG categories 1-4, respectively (p trend < 0.001). The riskof advanced cancers after a negative screening episode was 1.0‰, 1.3‰, 1.1‰, and 4.2‰ (p trend = 0.003). The highest BD category, compared with the other threetogether, has double the invasive BC risk (RR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.5-2.8) and almostfourfold risk of advanced cancer (RR = 3.8; 95% CI 1.8-8.0).CONCLUSION: BD has a strong impact on the risk of advanced cancers after anegative screening episode, the best early surrogate of BC mortality. Therefore, our results suggest that screening effectiveness is quite different among BDcategories.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1025-8 PMID: 30092817
