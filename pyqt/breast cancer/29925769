Recently,three potential small-molecule inhibitors of Mps1 (i.e., reversine, NMS-P715, andits derivative Cpd-5) were reported for the C604Y mutation that exhibitsignificant resistance to NMS-P715 and Cpd-5, but retain affinity for reversine. In this study, classical molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, accelerated MD (aMD)simulations, and umbrella sampling (US) simulations were performed to illustrate the resistance mechanisms of inhibitors to Mps1. The classical MD simulationscombined with free energy calculations revealed that reversine features similarbinding affinity characteristics to both Mps1WT and Mps1C604Y, but both NMS-P715 and Cpd-5 feature much higher binding affinities to Mps1WT than to Mps1C604Y. Themajor variations were shown to be controlled by electrostatic energy and theconformational change of A-loop-induced entropy increased. The largeconformational changes of Mps1C604Y bound to NMS-P715 and Cpd-5 were alsoobserved in aMD simulations. The US simulation results further suggest thatreversine and Cpd-5 both exhibit similar dissociation processes from both Mps1WT and Mps1C604Y, but Cpd-5 and NMS-P715 were found to dissociate more easily fromMps1C604Y than from Mps1WT, thus a reduced residence time was responsible for theinhibitors resistance to the C604Y mutation. The physical principles provided by the present study may provide important clues for the discovery and rationaldesign of novel inhibitors to combat the C604Y mutation of Mps1.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23061488 PMID: 29925769
