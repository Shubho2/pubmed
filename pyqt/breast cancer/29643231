OCDC was administeredalone (cohort 1, n = 5), in combination with bevacizumab (cohort 2, n = 10), orbevacizumab plus low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (cohort 3, n = 10) untildisease progression or vaccine exhaustion. A total of 392 vaccine doses wereadministered without serious adverse events. Vaccination induced T cell responsesto autologous tumor antigen, which were associated with significantly prolongedsurvival. Vaccination also amplified T cell responses against mutated neoepitopesderived from nonsynonymous somatic tumor mutations, and this included priming of T cells against previously unrecognized neoepitopes, as well as novel T cellclones of markedly higher avidity against previously recognized neoepitopes. Weconclude that the use of oxidized whole-tumor lysate DC vaccine is safe andeffective in eliciting a broad antitumor immunity, including private neoantigens,and warrants further clinical testing.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science.
