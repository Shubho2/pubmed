This study investigated whetherinhibition of centrosome clustering enhances the radiation sensitivity of breast cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, inhibition of centrosome clustering wasexamined by using various centrosome-declustering agents and KIFC1 siRNA in threebreast cancer cell lines and two normal fibroblast cell lines. The combinationeffect of radiation and centrosome declustering was evaluated by cell viability, clonogenic, immunofluorescence assay.RESULTS: This study showed that targeting centrosome clustering enhanced theefficacy of radiotherapy of breast cancer cells with less damage to normal cells.Ionizing radiation induced centrosome amplification in breast cancer cells, butnot in normal fibroblast cells. Notably, we showed that centrosome declusteringefficiently radiosensitized the centrosome-amplified breast cancer cells through induction of multipolar spindles but did not affect the viability of normalfibroblasts in response to irradiation. Furthermore, KIFC1 mediated theradiosensitivity of the centrosome-amplified breast cancer cells.CONCLUSION: Our data provided the first evidence that centrosome clustering is a tumor-selective target for the improvement of radiotherapy in breast cancercells.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12606 PMID: 29848688  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
