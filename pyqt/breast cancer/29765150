AZD1208 is apotent ATP-competitive PIM kinase inhibitor investigated in patients withrecurrent or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or advanced solid tumours.METHODS: Two dose-escalation studies were performed to evaluate the safety andtolerability, and to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of AZD1208 in AMLand solid tumours. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics,pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary efficacy of AZD1208.RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients received treatment: 32 in the AML study over a120-900 mg dose range, and 25 in the solid tumour study over a 120-800 mg doserange. Nearly all patients (98.5%) in both studies experienced adverse events,mostly gastrointestinal (92.5%). Dose-limiting toxicities included rash, fatigue and vomiting. AZD1208 was not tolerated at 900 mg, and the protocol-defined MTDwas not confirmed. AZD1208 increased CYP3A4 activity after multiple dosing,resulting in increased drug clearance. There were no clinical responses; PDanalysis showed biological activity of AZD1208.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of single-agent clinical efficacy with AZD1208, PIMkinase inhibition may hold potential as an anticancer treatment, perhaps incombination with other agents.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0082-1 PMID: 29765150
