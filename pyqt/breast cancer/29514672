In this model, normal epithelial cells undergo a mutation to becomeintermediate cells, which, after further mutation, become malignant cells. Aclone of such cells grows to become a tumor. The model also incorporates changes with age in the number of susceptible epithelial cells associated with menarche, parity, and menopause. We used measurements of the radiological properties ofbreast tissue in 4454 healthy subjects aged from 15 to 80+â€‰years to estimatecumulative exposure to PMD (CBD) in the population, and we examined theassociation of CBD with the age-incidence curve of breast cancer in thepopulation.RESULTS: Extensive PMD is associated with a greater number of breast epithelialcells, lobules, and fibroblasts, and greater amounts of collagen andextracellular matrix. The known biological properties of these tissue components may, singly or in combination, promote the acquisition of mutations by breastepithelial cells specified by the Moolgavkar model, and the subsequent growth of a clone of malignant cells to form a tumor. We also show that estimated CBD inthe population from ages 15 to 80+ years is closely associated with theage-incidence curve of breast cancer in the population.CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that thebiological properties of the breast tissue components associated with PMDincrease the probability of the transition of normal epithelium to malignantcells, and that the accumulation of mutations with CBD may influence theage-incidence curve of breast cancer. This hypothesis gives rise to severaltestable predictions.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0941-y PMCID: PMC5842598PMID: 29514672
