The ADC values of different shrinkage patterns (concentric shrinkage, nestor dendritic shrinkage, and mixed shrinkage) for tumours shown bydiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were measured independently using three ROIplacement methods (single-round, three-round, and freehand). Intraclasscorrelation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the interobserver variabilityin the ADC values. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed toidentify the independent predictors of PCR.RESULTS: The best placement method found was single-round ROI in all the patients(AUC=0.863). When analysed separately, the effectiveness results differed: thesingle-round method was optimal for concentrically shrinking tumours (AUC=0.970);the freehand method was optimal for nest or dendritically shrinking tumours(AUC=0.714); and the three-round method was optimal for mixed shrinking tumours(AUC=0.975). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that oestrogen receptor (ER), ΔADC% and tumour diameter reduction (ΔD%) were independent factors in evaluating the PCR.CONCLUSION: The methods for measuring ADC values vary across different shrinkage patterns of luminal tumours. ΔADC%, ER and ΔD% were independent factors forevaluating the PCR.Copyright © 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
