This study provides insights into the anti-proliferative activity of 12anticarcinogens from soybean by single or two-way combination treatment againstMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Results showed that genistein,daidzein, glycitein, genistin and dainzin showed stronger anti-proliferativeactivity against MCF-7 cells with EC50 values of 66.98 ± 4.87 μM, 130.14 ± 2.10μM, 190.67 ± 5.65 μM, 72.82 ± 2.66 μM and 179.21 ± 6.37 μM, respectively. Thereis a synergistic effect of combination treatment of genistin plus daidzin inMCF-7 cells with combination index at inhibition of 50% (CI50) of 0.89 ± 0.12.Genistein, glycitein, genistin and β-sitosterol were demonstrated to have astronger anti-proliferative activity against MDA-MB-231 cells with EC50 values of93.75 ± 5.15 μM, 142.67 ± 5.88 μM, 127.82 ± 4.70 μM and 196.28 ± 4.45 μM. Thesynergistic effect was observed in the mixture of genistein plus genistin,genistein plus β-sitosterol or β-sitosterol plus genistin with CI50 values of0.56 ± 0.13, 0.54 ± 0.20 and 0.45 ± 0.12, respectively. These bioactiveanticarcinogens were able to inhibit invasion and migration of breast cancercells and the combination treatments enhanced the inhibitory effect. Regulationof PI3K/Akt/mTORpathway seems to be the main mechanisms involved in theanticancer activity.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23071557 PMID: 29954123
