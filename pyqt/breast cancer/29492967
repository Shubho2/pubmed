Epub 2018 Mar 1.The Solace of an Uncertain Future: Acute Illness, the Self, and Self-Care.Weingarten K(1)(2), Worthen M(3).Author information: (1)The Witnessing Project, Berkeley, CA.(2)Walking-in-Witness Project, Berkeley, CA.(3)Department of Health Science and Recreation, San Jose State University, SanJose, CA."Take care of yourself" may be one of the most ubiquitous phrases spoken topeople who are ill or to their caretakers. Yet few people who offer it as a balm consider what the self experience is of the person to whom the injunction isoffered. We unravel some of the paradoxes inherent in the phrase, illustratingcomplexities that arise in the context of a life-threatening diagnosis. Toillustrate the relational nature of the self, we analyze a partial transcript of an interview conducted in 1988 with the authors-a family therapist mother who hadrecently undergone surgery for breast cancer and her then 9-year-old daughter. Wealso examine the role of time in the interview. We propose that unlike PTSD when the past invades the present, in life-threatening illness the future isforeclosed, leading to distortions in current perception and behavior. The secondauthor presents a follow-up to the interview and relates it to her currentexperience as a mother with chronic health issues. We close with suggestions for clinicians.Â© 2018 Family Process Institute.DOI: 10.1111/famp.12347 PMID: 29492967
