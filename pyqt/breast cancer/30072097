In an attempt to find out the TNBCs'microenvironment, we ran into the endogenous expression of a newly discoveredcytokine known as Interleukin (IL)-22.METHODS: Thirty TNBC patients were recruited and the levels of IL-22 producing(Th22) cells in tumor, paratumor and normal breast tissues were measured. Then westudied the role and mechanism of IL-22 in migration and paclitaxel resistance inTNBC cells MDA-MB 468 and MDA-MB 231.RESULTS: The prevalence of Th22 cells were gradually increased in normal,paratumor and tumor tissues. In vitro, IL-22 promotes TNBC cells migration andinduces paclitaxel resistance. Importantly, IL-22 exposure of TNBC cells resultedin JAK-STAT3/MAPKs/AKT signaling pathways activated.CONCLUSION: IL-22 may play an accelerating role in the development of TNBC andmay open a new therapeutic approach for TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
