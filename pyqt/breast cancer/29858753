This included an initial cohort of 8 IBC patients and 60 non-IBC patients followed by a validation cohort of 19 IBCpatients and 25 non-IBC patients. Samples were immunostained for eitherCD44+CD49f+CD133/2+ mammary stem cell markers or the CD68 macrophage marker andcorrelated with IBC status. Quantitation of positive cells was determined usinginForm software from PerkinElmer. We also examined the association between IBCstatus and previously published tumorigenic stem cell and IBC tumor signatures inthe validation cohort samples.RESULTS: 8 of 8 IBC samples expressed isolated CD44+CD49f+CD133/2+ stem cellmarked cells in the initial cohort as opposed to 0/60 non-IBC samples(p = 0.001). Similarly, the median number of CD44+CD49f+CD133/2+ cells wassignificantly higher in the IBC validation cohort as opposed to the non-IBCvalidation cohort (25.7 vs. 14.2, p = 0.007). 7 of 8 IBC samples expressedCD68 + histologically confirmed macrophages in initial cohort as opposed to 12/48non-IBC samples (p = 0.001). In the validation cohort, the median number ofCD68 + cells in IBC was 3.7 versus 1.0 in the non-IBC cohort (p = 0.06). IBCnormal tissue was positively associated with a tumorigenic stem cell signature(p = 0.02) and with a 79-gene IBC signature (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Normal tissue from IBC patients is enriched for both mammary stemcells and macrophages and has higher association with both a tumorigenic stemcell signature and IBC-specific tumor signature. Collectively, these data suggestthat IBC normal tissue differs from non-IBC tissue. Whether these changes occurbefore the tumor develops or is induced by tumor warrants further investigation.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4835-6 PMID: 29858753
