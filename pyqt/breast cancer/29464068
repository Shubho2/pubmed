Typically, heparanase levels are evaluated in a biopsy taken from the primary lesion, whereas its expression by the resulting metastases is mostoften unresolved. This becomes critically important as anti-heparanase compounds enter advanced clinical trials. Here, we examined the expression of heparanase inpairs of primary and the resulting distant metastases of breast carcinoma.Interestingly, we found that heparanase expression in the metastatic lesion does not always reflect its expression in the primary tumor. Accordingly, in somecases, the primary lesion was stained positive for heparanase while themetastasis stained negative, and vice versa. Heparanase discordance occurred in38% of the patients, higher than that reported for hormone receptors, and wasassociated with bad prognosis. Thus, examination of heparanase levels in thetumor metastases should be evaluated for most efficient precision medicineapplying heparanase inhibitors. Furthermore, we found that in stage I breastcancer patients strong heparanase staining is associated with shorter overallsurvival. Thus, heparanase levels can assist in the diagnosis and in determining the necessity and type of treatment in early stage breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23560 PMCID: PMC5814208PMID: 29464068
