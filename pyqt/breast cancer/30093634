Here, we revealed that miR-34family, and miR-34a in particular, is implicated in mammary epitheliumhomoeostasis. Expression of miR-34a occurs upon luminal commitment anddifferentiation and serves to inhibit the expansion of the pool of MaSCs andearly progenitor cells, likely in a p53-independent fashion. Mutant mice(miR34-KO) and loss-of-function approaches revealed two separate functions ofmiR-34a, controlling both proliferation and fate commitment in mammaryprogenitors by modulating several pathways involved in epithelial cell plasticityand luminal-to-basal conversion. In particular, miR-34a acts as endogenousinhibitor of the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway, targeting up to nineupstream regulators at the same time, thus modulating the expansion of theMaSCs/early progenitor pool. These multiple roles of miR-34a are maintained in a model of human breast cancer, in which chronic expression of miR-34a intriple-negative mesenchymal-like cells (enriched in cancer stem cells-CSCs) couldpromote a luminal-like differentiation programme, restrict the CSC pool, andinhibit tumour propagation. Hence, activation of miR-34a-dependent programmescould provide a therapeutic opportunity for the subset of breast cancers, whichare rich in CSCs and respond poorly to conventional therapies.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0445-3 PMID: 30093634
