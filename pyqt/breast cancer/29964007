[Epub ahead of print]Is the membrane estrogen receptor, GPER1, a promiscuous receptor that modulatesnuclear estrogen receptor-mediated functions in the brain?Vajaria R(1), Vasudevan N(2).Author information: (1)School of Biological Sciences, Hopkins Building, University of ReadingWhiteKnights Campus, Reading RG6 6AS, United Kingdom.

Both rapid, non-genomic signaling as well asgenomic transcriptional signaling via intracellular estrogen receptors (ER)s can change behavior. Rapid non-genomic signaling is initiated from the plasmamembrane by a G-protein coupled receptor called GPER1 that binds 17β-estradiol.GPER1 or GPR30 is one of the candidates for a membrane ER (mER) that is not only highly expressed in pathology i.e. cancers but also in severalbehaviorally-relevant brain regions. In the brain, GPER1 signaling, in responseto estrogen, facilitates neuroprotection, social behaviors and cognition. In thisreview, we describe several notable characteristics of GPER1 such as the ability of several endogenous steroids as well as artificially synthesized molecules tobind the GPER1. In addition, GPER1 is localized to the plasma membrane in breast cancer cell lines but may be present in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgiapparatus in the hippocampus. Unusually, GPER1 can also translocate to theperinuclear space from the plasma membrane. We explore the idea that subcellular localization and ligand promiscuity may determine the varied downstream signalingcascades of the activated GPER1. Lastly, we suggest that GPER1 can act as amodulator of ERα-mediated action on a convergent target, spinogenesis, in neuronsthat in turn drives female social behaviors such as lordosis and social learning.Copyright © 2018.
