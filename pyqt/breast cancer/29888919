Quantification of low concentrations of specific exosomes present in very small volumes ofclinical samples may be used for noninvasive cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Wedeveloped an immunosorbent assay for digital qualification of target exosomesusing droplet microfluidics. The exosomes were immobilized on magnetic microbeadsthrough sandwich ELISA complexes tagged with an enzymatic reporter that produces a fluorescent signal. The constructed beads were further isolated andencapsulated into a sufficient number of droplets to ensure only a single beadwas encapsulated in a droplet. Our droplet-based single-exosome-countingenzyme-linked immunoassay (droplet digital ExoELISA) approach enables absolutecounting of cancer-specific exosomes to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We wereable to achieve a limit of detection (LOD) down to 10 enzyme-labeled exosomecomplexes per microliter (âˆ¼10-17 M). We demonstrated the application of thedroplet digital ExoELISA platform in quantitative detection of exosomes in plasmasamples directly from breast cancer patients. We believe our approach may havethe potential for early diagnosis of cancer and accelerate the discovery ofcancer exosomal biomarkers for clinical diagnosis.DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b01184 PMID: 29888919
