Oxidative stress induces numeroussignaling pathways, including DNA damage response (DDR), associated with thebreast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) protein, known to date fromnumerous reports in the cancer field. In this Viewpoint, we discuss the latestdiscoveries related to the role of BRCA1 in the death of neurons in AD. Weunderline the role of BRCA1 in the development of neurons and speculate on theconsequences of BRCA1 dysfunction in the dying brain. In general, this Viewpoint is in a line with several recent reports on the processes and players common atthe molecular and genetic level for neurodegenerative and cancerous diseases.DOI: 10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00149 PMID: 29634233
