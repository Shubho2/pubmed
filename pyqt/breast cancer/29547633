Although seven HS3ST isozymes have been described in human, 3-O-sulfation is a relatively rare modification, and only a few biologicalprocesses have been described to be influenced by 3-O-sulfated motifs. Aconflicting literature has recently reported that HS3ST2, 3A, 3B and 4 mayexhibit either tumor-promoting or anti-oncogenic properties, depending on themodel used and cancer cell phenotype. Hence, we decided to compare theconsequences of the overexpression of each of these HS3STs in the same cellularmodel. We demonstrated that, unlike HS3ST3A, the other three isozymes enhancedthe proliferation of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells. Moreover, thecolony forming capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells was markedly increased by theexpression of HS3ST2, 3B and 4. No notable difference was observed between thethree isozymes, meaning that the modifications catalyzed by each HS3ST had thesame functional impact on cell behavior. We then demonstrated that overexpressionof HS3ST2, 3B and 4 was accompanied by increased activation of c-Src, Akt andNF-κB and up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and XIAP. In linewith these findings, we showed that HS3ST-transfected cells are more resistant tocell death induction by pro-apoptotic stimuli or NK cells. Altogether, ourfindings demonstrate that HS3ST2, 3B and 4 share the same pro-tumoral activityand support the idea that these HS3STs could compensate each other for loss oftheir expression depending on the molecular signature of cancer cells and/orchanges in the tumor environment.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194676 PMCID: PMC5856405PMID: 29547633  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
