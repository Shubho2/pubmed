Analysis of statistical associationbetween clinical pathological features, sTIL, pCR and survival were carried outusing SPSSvs19.RESULTS: Median age was 49 years (range 24-84 years) and the most frequentclinical stage was IIIB (58.3%). Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched and(triple-negative) TN phenotype was found in 24.6%, 37.9%, 17.7% and 19.8%,respectively. pCR was observed in 11% and median percentage of sTIL was 40%(2%-95%) in the whole population. pCR was associated to Ct1-2 (P = 0.045) and to high sTIL (P = 0.029) in the whole population. There was a slight trend towardssignificance for sTIL (P = 0.054) in Luminal A. sTIL was associated with gradeIII (P < 0.001), no-Luminal A subtype (P < 0.001), RE-negative (P < 0.001),PgR-negative (P < 0.001), HER2-positive (P = 0.002) and pCR (P = 0.029) in thewhole population. Longer disease-free survival was associated with grade I-II (P = 0.006), cN0 (P < 0.001), clinical stage II (P = 0.004), ER-positive (P <0.001), PgR-positive (P < 0.001), luminal A (P < 0.001) and pCR (P = 0.002).Longer disease-free survival was associated with grade I-II in Luminal A (P <0.001), N0-1 in Luminal A (P = 0.045) and TNBC (P = 0.01), clinical stage II inLuminal A (P = 0.003) and TNBC (P = 0.038), and pCR in TNBC (P < 0.001). Longeroverall survival was associated with grade I-II (P < 0.001), ER-positive (P <0.001), PgR-positive (P < 0.001), Luminal A (P < 0.001), cN0 (P = 0.002) and pCR (P = 0.002) in the whole population. Overall survival was associated withclinical stage II (P = 0.017) in Luminal A, older age (P = 0.042) in Luminal B,and pCR in TNBC (P = 0.005).CONCLUSION: Predictive and prognostic values of clinicopathological features,like pCR and sTIL, differ depending on the evaluated molecular subtype.DOI: 10.5306/wjco.v9.i2.33 PMCID: PMC5893995PMID: 29651385
