However, it is usually associated with limitedactivity and development of toxicity and resistance. This study aimed to describean in situ pH-responsive niosomes as a carrier for localized and sustaineddelivery of TXC. The thin film hydration method was utilized to produce TXCniosomes using sorbitan monostearate and cholesterol of 1:1 Molar ratio. Theproduced formula displayed nano-spherical shape with entrapment efficiency (EE)of 88.90 ± 0.72% and drug release of 49.2 ± 1.51% within 8 h. This formula wasincorporated into chitosan/glyceryl monooleate (CH/GMO) as a localized in situpH-responsive hydrogel delivery system. Different formulae were produced byDesign-Expert software based on user-defined response surface design utilizingdifferent chitosan concentration (A) and GMO concentration (B) characterized for mean viscosity (R2) and in vitro release studies (R1). The results displayed thatR1 was significantly antagonistic with both of A and B while R2 was significantlysynergistic with both of them. The optimum formula was selected and capped withgold as an ideal candidate for computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the efficacy and tissue distribution of TXC utilizing Ehrlich carcinoma mice model. Theoptimum formula showed localized TXC in a tumour and consequently a significantanti-tumour efficacy compared with free TXC. Based on these outcomes, the novelin situ pH-responsive TXC-loaded noisome could be a promising formula for theefficient treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s13346-018-0499-3 PMID: 29488171
