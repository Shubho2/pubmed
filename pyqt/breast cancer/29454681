Electronicaddress: kshin1@mdanderson.org.(2)The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Currently, there are no clear indications or guidelines for performing breastmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in male patients diagnosed with primary breastcancer. The literature is also very limited on the usage of breast MRI in malepatients. Although it is not common or recommended as a routine clinical practiceto perform breast MRI in male patients even in the setting of a diagnosis ofbreast cancer, there are few instances where MRI may help clinicians andsurgeons.
