Electronic address:848864017@qq.com.Metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is involved intumor cell growth process. However, its role and molecular mechanism in livercancer is still not fully understood. In this study, we found that MALAT1 wassignificantly expressed in liver cancer cell lines. And knockdown of MALAT1suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion of HepG2 cells, accompanied withdecrease of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), α-smoothmuscle actin (α-SMA), N-cadherin, Vimentin and TWIST. Significantly, MALAT1deletion sensitized HepG2 cells to 5-FU-induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, asevidenced by the significant reduction in Cyclin D1 and CDK4 and increase in p53,p21 and p27 protein levels. In addition, MALAT1 knockdown triggered 5-FU induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells by inducing intrinsic apoptosis-related signals,including Cyto-c, Apaf-1, cleaved Caspase-9/-7/-3 and poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB (p-NF-κB) wasalso down-regulated by MALAT1 silence. Importantly, suppression of IKKα/NF-κBsignificantly elevated apoptosis and reduced liver cancer cell viability inMALAT1-knockdown cells with 5-FU incubation. The nude mice transplantation model also confirmed the promoted sensitivity of MALAT1-silenced HepG2 cells to 5-FU byblocking tumor cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Therefore, our datasupplied a potential mechanism by which knockdown of MALAT1 might play animportant role in augmenting sensitivity of HepG2 cells to 5-FU in therapeuticapproaches, demonstrating suppressing of MALAT1 may serve as a combination withchemotherapeutic agents in liver cancer treatment.Copyright © 2018.
