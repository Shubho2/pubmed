So far, no marker has been identified that isspecifically associated with the benefit from dual HER2 blockade.Objective: To examine if use of the T-cell β chain variable genes adds to thepotential association of immune gene signatures with response to dual HER2blockade.Design, Setting, and Participants: In the NeoALTTO trial, HER2-positive patients recruited between January 5, 2008, and May 27, 2010, were treated with paclitaxelplus either lapatinib or trastuzumab or both as neoadjuvant therapy. In thisstudy, RNA sequencing data from baseline tumor specimens of 245 patients in theNeoALTTO trial were analyzed and reads were aligned to TRBV gene referencesequences using a previously published Basic Local Alignment Search Tool T-cellreceptor mapping pipeline. Total TRBV gene use, Shannon entropy, and generichness were calculated for each tumor, and nonnegative matrix factorization wasused to define TRBV co-use metagenes (TMGs). The association between TRBVmetrics, tumor genomic metrics, and response was assessed with multivariablelogistic regression. Statistical analysis was performed from January 23 toDecember 2, 2017.Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between TRBV use metrics and pCR.Results: Among the 245 women with available data (mean [SD] age, 49 [11] years), total TRBV use correlated positively with a gene expression signature for immune activity (Spearman ρ = 0.93; P < .001). High use of TRBV11-3 and TMG2,characterized by high use of TRBV4.3, TRBV6.3, and TRBV7.2, was associated with ahigher rate of pCR to dual HER2-targeted therapy (TRBV11-3 interaction: oddsratio, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.22-6.47]; P = .02; TMG2 interaction: odds ratio, 3.39 [95%CI, 1.57-8.27]; P = .004). Immune-rich cancers with high TMG2 levels (n = 92) hadsignificantly better response to dual HER2-targeted treatment compared with thesingle therapy arms (rate of pCR, 68% [95% CI, 52%-83%] vs 21% [95% CI, 10%-31%];P < .001), whereas those with low TMG2 levels did not benefit from dual therapy. High TMG2 levels were also associated with a higher rate of pCR to the combinedtherapy in immune-poor tumors (n = 30; pCR, 50% [95% CI, 22%-78%] vs 6% [95% CI, 0%-16%]; P = .009).Conclusions and Relevance: Use patterns of TRBV genes potentially provideinformation about the association with response to dual HER2 blockade beyondimmune gene signatures. High use of TRBV11.3 or TRBV4.3, TRBV6.3, and TRBV7.2identifies patients who have a better response to dual HER2 targeted therapy.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00553358.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.1564 PMID: 29902299
