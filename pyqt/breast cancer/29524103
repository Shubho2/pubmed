Geneticsin the Republic of Ireland is under-resourced, with the lowest number ofconsultants per million of population in Europe. In November 2014, we establishedthe monthly adult Neurogenetics clinic in Ireland, staffed by 2 consultants and 2registrars from each speciality. We see patients with complex rare neurologicalconditions that may potentially have an underlying genetic basis, in the presenceor absence of a family history. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis,reviewing symptoms and work-up data. Twenty-seven patients attended a pilotclinic over 12 months. Conditions encountered included Parkin-related PD,leucodystrophy, ataxia, fronto-temporal lobar degeneration, spinocerebellarataxia type 6 (SCA6) and ataxia-telangiectasia. Identification of pathogenicmutations directed screening, treatment and facilitated onward geneticcounselling (n = 10, 33%). A number of novel mutations were identified in MAPTgene ("missing tau mutation" McCarthy et al., Brain, 2015), SLCA1 gene and GRN(progranulin). Phenotypic features not previously reported were seen; e.g.writer's cramp in SCA6; paroxysmal myoclonus in the glucose transporter proteintype 1 (GLUT1) deficiency. Breast cancer screening for ATM mutations carriers andreferral to international experts in two undiagnosed patients were arranged. The establishment of a Neurogenetics clinic has addressed a gap in service andallowed identification of rare and atypical diagnoses.DOI: 10.1007/s11845-018-1784-3 PMID: 29524103
