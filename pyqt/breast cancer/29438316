However, only little is known about thefactors that affect the cellular expression levels. Here we assessed the PD-L1expression on different breast cancer cell lines under standard in vitro culture conditions and as a function of Epirubicin or Paclitaxel treatment. Moreover, we evaluated the expression in immunodeficient tumor mice as well as in humanizedtumor mice (i.e., in the presence of a human immune system). We found highestPD-L1 levels in JIMT-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Epirubicin treatment caused adecrease and Paclitaxel treatment an increased PD-L1 expression in MDA-MB-231cells. In addition, we identified nuclear PD-L1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. All in vivo transplanted breast cancer cell lines downregulated PD-L1 expression compared to their in vitro counterpart. Neither the gene copy number nor the presence ofhuman immune system in humanized tumor mice had an effect on the PD-L1 content.We demonstrate that the degree of PD-L1 expression amongst breast cancer celllines varies considerably. In addition, cytotoxic treatments and other extrinsic parameters differentially affect the expression. Hence, further investigationsincluding in vivo evaluations are necessary to understand PD-L1 regulation foradvanced breast cancer stratification.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19020563 PMCID: PMC5855785PMID: 29438316
