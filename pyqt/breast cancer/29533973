The female sex hormone, estrogen is implicated in the origin and progression of breast cancer. Estrogens stimulate and antiestrogens suppress the expression of polyamine biosynthetic enzyme, ornithine decarboxylate (ODC). Usingseveral bis(ethyl)spermine analogues, we found that these analogues inhibited theproliferation of estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor negative breastcancer cells in culture. There was structure-activity relationship in theefficacy of these compounds in suppressing cell growth. The activity of ODC wasinhibited by these compounds, whereas the activity of the catabolizing enzyme,spermidine/spermine NÂ¹-acetyl transferase (SSAT) was increased by 6-fold bybis(ethyl)norspermine in MCF-7 cells. In a transgenic mouse model of breastcancer, bis(ethyl)norspermine reduced the formation and growth of spontaneousmammary tumor. Recent studies indicate that induction of polyamine catabolicenzymes SSAT and spermine oxidase (SMO) play key roles in the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of polyamine analogues and their combinations withchemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and paclitaxel. Thus,polyamine catabolic enzymes might be important therapeutic targets and markers ofsensitivity in utilizing polyamine analogues in combination with othertherapeutic agents.DOI: 10.3390/medsci6010024 PMCID: PMC5872181PMID: 29533973
