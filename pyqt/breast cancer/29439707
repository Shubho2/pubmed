We investigated factors associated with clinical outcomes for liver metastases treated with SBRT from amulti-center, international patient registry.METHODS: Patients with liver metastases treated with SBRT were identified in the RSSearch® Patient Registry. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristicsassociated with treatment outcomes were assessed. Dose fractionations werenormalized to BED10. Overall survival (OS) and local control (LC) were evaluated using Kaplan Meier analysis and log-rank test.RESULTS: The study included 427 patients with 568 liver metastases from 25academic and community-based centers. Median age was 67 years (31-91 years).Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) was the most common primary cancer. 73% ofpatients received prior chemotherapy. Median tumor volume was 40 cm3(1.6-877 cm3), median SBRT dose was 45 Gy (12-60 Gy) delivered in a median of 3fractions [1-5]. At a median follow-up of 14 months (1-91 months) the medianoverall survival (OS) was 22 months. Median OS was greater for patients with CRC (27 mo), breast (21 mo) and gynecological (25 mo) metastases compared to lung (10mo), other gastro-intestinal (GI) (18 mo) and pancreatic (6 mo) primaries(p < 0.0001). Smaller tumor volumes (< 40 cm3) correlated with improved OS(25 months vs 15 months p = 0.0014). BED10 ≥ 100 Gy was also associated withimproved OS (27 months vs 15 months p < 0.0001). Local control (LC) was evaluablein 430 liver metastases from 324 patients. Two-year LC rates was better forBED10 ≥ 100 Gy (77.2% vs 59.6%) and the median LC was better for tumors < 40 cm3 (52 vs 39 months). There was no difference in LC based on histology of theprimary tumor.CONCLUSIONS: In a large, multi-institutional series of patients with livermetastasis treated with SBRT, reasonable LC and OS was observed. OS and LCdepended on dose and tumor volume, while OS varied by primary tumor. Futureprospective trials on the role of SBRT for liver metastasis from differentprimaries in the setting of multidisciplinary management including systemictherapy, is warranted.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01885299 .DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-0969-2 PMCID: PMC5811977PMID: 29439707
