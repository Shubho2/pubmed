We conducted an open-label, randomized phase II trial to compare the efficacy of these strategies.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with HER2-positive MBC previously treated withtrastuzumab and taxanes were randomly assigned to receive trastuzumab pluscapecitabine (HX) or lapatinib plus capecitabine (LX). The primary endpoint wasprogression-free survival (PFS) and the secondary endpoints included overallsurvival (OS) and the objective response rate (ORR). To explore the predictivevalue of the differential benefit of anti-HER2 drugs, PIK3CA mutations wereassessed using circulating tumor DNA.RESULTS: Eighty-six patients (43 in each arm) were enrolled. The median PFS was6.1 months in the HX arm and 7.1 months in the LX arm (hazard ratio, 0.81; 90%CI, 0.55-1.21; p = 0.39); the median OS was 31.0 months in the HX arm and was notreached in the LX arm (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.26-1.31; p = 0.18). The ORR was 40% in the HX arm and 41% in the LX arm. PIK3CA mutations were detected in23% of the 35 analyzed patients, and in patients without PIK3CA mutations, LXyielded relatively longer PFS and OS than HX.CONCLUSION: In women with HER2-positive MBC previously treated with trastuzumaband taxanes, no significant differences in PFS and OS were observed betweenpatients treated with LX and HX.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000005219.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
