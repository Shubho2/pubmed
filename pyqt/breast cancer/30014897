Electronic address: kswu@stu.edu.cn.Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are suspected to be associated with breastcancer risk because of their estrogenic potencies. Epidemiological studies ofPBDEs and breast cancer are scarce. Our study aimed to estimate the associationbetween adipose-tissue PBDE concentrations and breast cancer risk. A total of 209breast cancer cases and 165 controls were recruited from hospitals betweenJanuary 2014 and May 2016 in Shantou, Chaoshan area, China. Concentrations of 14 PBDE congeners were measured in adipose tissues obtained from the breast forcases and the abdomen/breast for controls during surgery. Demographic andclinicopathologic characteristics were obtained from medical records. Breastcancer risk as well as clinicopathologic characteristics were evaluated byadipose-tissue PBDE level. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for breast cancer risk associated with levels of PBDE congeners wereestimated from logistic regression models for all cases and stratified byestrogen receptor (ER) status. Level of total PBDEs (∑PBDE) and most individualPBDE congeners were higher in breast cancer cases than controls (median ∑PBDE,94.99 vs 73.72 ng/g lipid). In the adjusted univariate model for all cases,breast cancer risk was increased with both 2nd and 3rd tertiles versus the 1sttertile of BDE-47 level (OR 2.05 [95% CI 1.08-3.92]; 5.47 [2.96-10.11]) andBDE-209 level (2.48 [1.30-4.73]; 4.72 [2.52-8.83]) with trend (both P < 0.001)and with the 3rd tertile of BDE-28 level (2.83 [1.63-4.92]), BDE-99 (3.22[1.85-5.60]), BDE-100 (5.45 [2.90-10.23]), BDE-138 (2.40 [1.37-4.20]), BDE-153(1.74 [1.02-2.97]), BDE-154 (1.84 [1.05-3.22]), and ∑PBDE levels (1.83[1.07-3.14]) but decreased with the 3rd tertile of BDE-71 level (0.38[0.22-0.65]) with trend (all P < 0.01). After stratifying by ER-positive or-negative status, the adjusted results were similar for ER-positive patientsexcept for BDE-153 and BDE-154, with no statistical significance. In themultivariate model for all cases, age, menarche age, BDE-47, 71, 99, 100, 183 and209 were independent factors associated with breast-cancer risk. ∑PBDE and mostindividual PBDE congeners investigated were positively associated with breastcancer risk in women from the Chaoshan area, China. PBDE may play a role in theoccurrence and development of breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.envres.2018.07.009 PMID: 30014897
