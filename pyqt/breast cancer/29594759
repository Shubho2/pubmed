Hence, there is urgency indeveloping new or novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of TNBC. Our studyshows that the Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) is a marker associated with TNBC and may play a key role in TNBC disease progression.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ELISA method was used to measure secreted MCP-1, and mRNAlevels were determined by Real-time PCR in numerous cancer cell lines,representing various breast cancer subtypes. Cellular invasiveness was determinedby Boyden chamber assay.RESULTS: Our data show that MCP-1 is upregulated in TNBC cell lines bothtranscriptionally as well as in secreted protein levels compared to ER-positiveluminal cell line, MCF-7. Breast cancer patients, with Basal or Claudin-lowsubtypes, also showed high expression of MCP-1. MCP-1 treatment induced cellinvasion in various breast cancer cell types, without affecting cellproliferation. Small molecule antagonists against Chemokine Receptor 2 (CCR2),cognate receptor for MCP-1 as well as the MAP kinase pathway inhibitor U0126negatively affected MCP-1 induced MCF-7 cell invasion. This suggests thatMCP-1-CCR2 axis may regulate invasiveness via the MAP Kinase pathway. Knockingdown MCP-1 decreased cell invasion in TNBC cell line BT-549, along withdownregulation of key epithelial to mesenchymal transition markers, N-cadherinand Vimentin.CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that MCP-1 mediated pathways could be potentialtherapeutic targets for the treatment of TNBC, and could reduce cancer healthdisparities.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4760-8 PMCID: PMC6022526PMID: 29594759
