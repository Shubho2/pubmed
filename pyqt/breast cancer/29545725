Tubeimu(TBM), the rhizome of Bolbostemma paniculatum (Maxim.) Franquet, is one of theChinese medicinal herbs used for breast diseases since the ancient times. Thepresent study evaluated the efficacy, especially the anti-metastatic effects ofthe dichloromethane extract of Tubeimu (ETBM) on TNBC orthotopic mouse models andcell lines.Methods: We applied real-time imaging on florescent orthotopic TNBC mice modeland tested cell migration and invasion abilities with MDA-MB-231 cell line.Digital gene expression sequencing was performed and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis applied to explore the pathways influenced by ETBM.Moreover, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) and Westernblot were delivered to confirm the gene expression changes.Results: ETBM exhibited noticeable control on tumor metastasis and growth of TNBCtumors with no obvious toxicity. In compliance with this, it also showedinhibition of cell migration and invasion in vitro. Its impact on the changedbiological behavior in TNBC may be a result of decreased expression of integrinβ1 (ITGβ1), integrin β8 (ITGβ8) and Rho GTPase activating protein 5 (ARHGAP5),which disabled the focal adhesion pathway and caused change in cell morphology.Conclusions: This study reveals that ETBM has anti-metastatic effects onMDA-MB-231-GFP tumor and may lead to a new therapeutic agent for the integrative treatment of highly invasive TNBC.DOI: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2018.01.12 PMCID: PMC5842225PMID: 29545725
