Coevolution of the malignant mammary epithelium and its underlying stroma instigates cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) tosupport most, if not all, hallmarks of cancer progression. Here we delineate apreviously unappreciated role for CAFs as determinants of the molecular subtypeof breast cancer. We identified paracrine crosstalk between cancer cellsexpressing platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-CC and CAFs expressing thecognate receptors in human basal-like mammary carcinomas. Genetic orpharmacological intervention of PDGF-CC activity in mouse models of cancerresulted in conversion of basal-like breast cancers into a hormonereceptor-positive state that enhanced sensitivity to endocrine therapy inpreviously resistant tumors. We conclude that specification of breast cancer tothe basal-like subtype is under microenvironmental control and is therapeuticallyactionable.DOI: 10.1038/nm.4494 PMCID: PMC5896729 [Available on 2018-09-12]PMID: 29529015
