Thus, it is significant to enhance anti-tumor and anti-metastasisefficacy simultaneously. The extracellular environment of most tumors is acidicwith pH 6.5-6.9, which play an important role in driving promotion of tumormetastasis. Herein, we developed an intratumoral injectable phospholipids-basedphase separation gel (PPSG) co-loaded with 5-fluotouracil (5FU) and magnesiumoxide (MgO), termed as 5FU + MgO-PPSG. It was prepared by simple mixing, andshowed in the appearance of a clear and yellow solution with good fluidity. Afterintratumoral injection, PPSG system achieved phase transition and sustainedreleased alkaline substance to neutralize acidic microenvironment in tumor site. Both in vitro and in vivo research showed a strong anti-tumor and anti-metastasisefficacy. 4T1-bearing mice after administration with 5FU + MgO-PPSG was achieved significantly prolonged survival time, compared with other groups. In conclusion,the novel 5FU + MgO-PPSG system might have a great potential to improve treatmentmethod against breast metastasis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
