Herein we estimated preventable fractions of colon and breast cancers inBrazil by increasing population-wide physical activity to differentcounterfactual scenarios.METHODS: We used data from a representative national survey in Brazil andcorresponding relative risks of colon and postmenopausal breast cancers from ameta-analysis. Estimated cancer incidence was retrieved from GLOBOCAN andBrazilian National Cancer Institute. Five counterfactual scenarios for physicalactivity were considered: (i) theoretical minimum risk exposure level (≥8,000metabolic equivalent of tasks-minute/week - MET-min/week); (ii) physical activityrecommendation (≥600 MET-min/week); (iii) a 10% reduction in prevalence ofinsufficient physical inactivity (<600 MET-min/week); (iv) physical activitylevel in each state equals the most active state in Brazil; (v) closing thegender differences in physical activity.RESULTS: About 19% (3,630 cases) of colon cancers and 12% (6,712 cases) ofpostmenopausal breast cancers could be prevented by increasing physical activity to ≥8,000 MET-min/week. Plausible counterfactual scenarios suggested thefollowing impact on cancer prevention: reaching physical activity recommendation:1.7% (1,113 cases) of breast and 6% (1,137 cases) of colon; 10% reduction inphysical inactivity prevalence: 0.2% (111 cases) of breast and 0.6% (114 cases)of colon; most active state scenario: 0.3% (168 cases) of breast and 1% (189cases) of colon; reducing gender differences in physical activity: 1.1% (384cases) of breast and 0.6% (122 cases) of colon.CONCLUSIONS: High levels of physical activity are required to achieve a sizableimpact on breast and colon cancer prevention in Brazil.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
