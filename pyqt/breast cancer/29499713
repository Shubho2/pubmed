The ability ofimmunoliposomes to target tumor-derived endothelial cells and perform genetransfer in vitro was measured and their basic biocompatibility was evaluated. A nude mouse/breast cancer xenograft model was used to examine the tumorinternalization of fluorescent-labeled liposomes and the clinical potential ofimmnuoliposomes loaded with pcDNA3.1-CSF1-endostatin.RESULTS: Loaded immunoliposomes were homogenously distributed with a well-definedspherical shape and bilayer, diameter of 122 ± 11 nm, and zeta potential + 1.40mV. No significant differences were observed in body weight, liver index,oxidative stress, or liver and kidney function in mice after liposomes exposure. The addition of CD105 mAb to liposomes conferred the ability to targettumor-derived endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Systemic intravenousadministration of fluorescent immunoliposomes in the xenograft model resulted in selective and efficient internalization in tumor vasculature. Treatment of micewith pcDNA3.1-CSF1-endostatin-loaded immunoliposomes suppressed tumor growth by71%.CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the advantages of using anti-CD105mAb-conjugated immunoliposomes to enhance tumor targeting, imaging, and genetransfer applications.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0712-8 PMCID: PMC5833054PMID: 29499713
