Hence, inhibiting AURKA offers a means of specifically targeting RalA (over RalB)in cancer cells. MLN8237 (alisertib) is a known inhibitor of aurora kinases; its specificity for AURKA, however, is compromised by its poor solubility andtransport across the cell membrane. A polymer nanovesicle platform is used forthe first time to deliver and differentially inhibit AURKA in cancer cells. Forthis purpose, polysaccharide nanovesicles made from amphiphilic dextran were usedas nanocarriers to successfully administer MLN8237 (VMLN) in cancer cells in 2Dand 3D microenvironments. These nanovesicles (<200 nm) carry the drug in theirintermembrane space with up to 85% of it released by the action of esteraseenzyme(s). Lysotracker experiments reveal the polymer nanovesicles localize inthe lysosomal compartment of the cell, where they are enzymatically targeted and MLN released in a controlled manner. Rhodamine B fluorophore trapped in thenanovesicles hydrophilic core (VMLN+RhB) allows us to visualize its uptake andlocalization in cells in a 2D and 3D microenvironment. In breast cancer, MCF-7cells VMLN inhibits AURKA significantly better than the free drug at lowconcentrations (0.02-0.04 Î¼M). This ensures that the drug in VMLN at theseconcentrations can specifically inhibit up to 94% of endogenous AURKA withoutaffecting AURKB. This targeting of AURKA causes the downstream differentialinhibition of active RalA (but not RalB). Free MLN8237 at similar concentrations and conditions failed to affect RalA activation. VMLN-mediated inhibition ofRalA, in turn, disrupts the anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cellssupporting a role for the AURKA-RalA crosstalk in mediating the same. Thesestudies not only identify the polysaccharide nanovesicle to be an improved way toefficiently deliver low concentrations of MLN8237 to inhibit AURKA but, in doing so, also help reveal a role for AURKA and its crosstalk with RalA inanchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cells.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00163 PMID: 29863884
