Most are metastasesto the renal parenchyma via a hematogenous route and are derived from lung,breast, and gastrointestinal cancer, malignant melanoma, and hematologicmalignant cancer. However, little is known about renal capsule metastasis fromother cancers.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 71-year-old woman with breast cancer who wastreated with endocrine therapy. She presented with gross hematuria and wasdiagnosed as having right renal pelvic cancer and renal cell cancer. Sheunderwent right laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy. Pathological findingsrevealed right pelvic cancer and renal capsule metastasis.CONCLUSION: Renal capsule metastasis derived from renal pelvic cancer is veryrare. When diagnosing renal capsule cancer, we believe that renal capsulemetastasis should also be taken into consideration. Clinical and radiologicaldifferential diagnosis of renal capsule metastasis from renal cell cancer andprimary renal capsule cancer is difficult. Assessment of the histopathologicalfindings of the surgical specimens seems to be the only realistic approach toachieving the correct diagnosis.DOI: 10.1186/s12894-018-0324-9 PMCID: PMC5831711PMID: 29490653
