Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & ResearchInstitute, 12902 USF Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL, 33612, USA.PURPOSE: We investigated the association of coffee consumption withpostmenopausal breast cancer risk, overall and by the status of postmenopausalhormone therapy (PMH).METHODS: This study included 126,182 postmenopausal women (2,636 with breastcancer and 123,546 without) from UK Biobank. Cancer diagnoses were ascertainedthrough the linkage to the UK National Health Service Central Registers.Information on breast cancer risk factors and coffee consumption was collected atbaseline and updated during follow-up. We used Cox proportional hazardsregression to evaluate associations between coffee consumption and breast cancer,overall and in stratified analyses by woman's PMH status (none, past, current).RESULTS: In the overall analysis, coffee consumption was not associated withbreast cancer risk (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.91-1.11 for 2-3 cups/day,and HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87-1.10 for ≥ 4 cups/day, p-trend = 0.69). Women with noPMH history who consumed ≥ 4 cups/day had a 16% reduced risk of breast cancer as compared to women who consumed < 7 cups/week (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71-1.00). Amongwomen with past PMH, those consuming ≥ 4 cups/day had a 22% greater risk ofbreast cancer than women consuming < 7 cups/week (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47). No association was found among current PMH users. We found no significantinteraction between PMH and coffee consumption (p = 0.24).CONCLUSIONS: Coffee consumption might be associated with increased breast cancer risk in women who used hormones in the past. Further studies are warranted toconfirm these findings and elucidate potential biological mechanisms underlyingthe observed associations.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1028-x PMID: 29651651
