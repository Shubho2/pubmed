Thioredoxin-interacting protein(TXNIP) is a key player of oxidative stress. This study aims to evaluate the roleof TXNIP as a predictor of ductal carcinoma in situ progression. Tissuemicroarrays from 776 pure ductal carcinoma in situ and 239 mixed ductal carcinomain situ and invasive tumors were constructed. All patients were treated at asingle institution with a long-term follow-up and TXNIP expression was assessedusing immunohistochemistry. TXNIP expression was investigated in terms ofassociations with clinicopathological and molecular features and patient outcome.Loss/reduced cytoplasmic expression of TXNIP was associated with features ofaggressiveness including high nuclear grade (p = 1.6 × 10-5), presence of comedo necrosis (p = 0.001), and estrogen receptor negative (ER-)/HER2- ductal carcinomain situ (p = 4.6 × 10-5). Univariate analysis showed an inverse associationbetween TXNIP expression and outcome in terms of shorter local recurrence-freesurvival (p = 0.009). Multivariable analyses showed that independent predictorsof ductal carcinoma in situ recurrence were low TXNIP expression (p = 0.005,HR = 0.51, and 95% CI: 0.32-0.81), larger ductal carcinoma in situ size, and highnuclear grade. TXNIP functions as a tumor suppressor gene with loss of itsexpression associated with ductal carcinoma in situ recurrence. TXNIP can be usedas a potentially useful marker in prognostic stratification of ductal carcinomain situ for management decisions.DOI: 10.1038/s41379-018-0086-7 PMID: 29955142
