Having bilateral mastectomy at the time of diagnosis notonly reduces risk of a contralateral breast cancer, but can eliminate the needfor radiation therapy and yield improved reconstruction options. However, mostpatients do not receive genetic counseling or testing at the time of theirdiagnosis. In this trial, we tested proactive rapid genetic counseling andtesting (RGCT) in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in order to facilitatepre-surgical genetic counseling and testing.METHODS: We recruited newly diagnosed breast cancer patients at increased riskfor carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation. Of 379 eligible patients who completed abaseline survey, 330 agreed to randomization in a 2:1 ratio to RGCT (n = 220)versus UC (n = 108). Primary outcomes were genetic counseling and testing uptake and breast cancer surgical decisions.RESULTS: RGCT led to higher overall (83.8% vs. 54.6%; p < 0.0001) andpre-surgical (57.8% vs. 38.7%; p = 0.001) genetic counseling uptake compared toUC. Despite higher rates of genetic counseling, RGCT did not differ from UC inoverall (54.1% vs. 49.1%, p > 0.10) or pre-surgical (30.6% vs. 27.4%, p > 0.10)receipt of genetic test results nor did they differ in uptake of bilateralmastectomy (26.6% vs. 21.8%, p > 0.10).CONCLUSIONS: Although RGCT yielded increased genetic counseling participation,this did not result in increased rates of pre-surgical genetic testing or impact surgical decisions. These data suggest that those patients most likely to opt forgenetic testing at the time of diagnosis are being effectively identified bytheir surgeons.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4773-3 PMCID: PMC6026034 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29611029
