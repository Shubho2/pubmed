Methods: A total of 72patients were collected from the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University fromJanuary 2016 to December 2017.79 breast masses were confirmed by biopsy orsurgical pathology.All the masses were classified by BI-RADS according toconventional ultrasound and CEUS was performed in parallel.Based on the resultsof the CEUS predictive model, the benign and malignant features of the breastBI-RADS type 4 tumors were re-determined: (1) conventional ultrasound BI-RADSclassification+ CEUS predictive model: both of them were malignant whenmalignant; (2) re-adjusting BI-RADS classification by CEUS predictive model: ifthe malignant CEUS predictive model, upgrade a class, if the benign CEUSpredictive model, downgrade a class.The diagnostic efficiency of the two methods in breast masses of BI-RADS 4 was compared. Results: (1) There were 36 malignant masses and 43 benign masses in 79 breast masses.Diagnostic sensitivity,specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value ofthe conventional ultrasound BI-RADS classification, CEUS predictive model,conventional ultrasound BI-RADS classification+ CEUS predictive model and theadjusted BI-RADS classification were 86.1%, 65.1%, 74.7%, 67.4%, 84.8%; 88.9%,76.7%, 82.3%, 76.2%, 89.2%; 80.6%, 86.0%, 83.5%, 82.9%, 84.1%; 97.2%, 76.7%,86.1%, 77.8%, 97.1%, respectively.(2) The area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) curve of conventional ultrasound BI-RADS classification,CEUS predictive model, conventional ultrasound BI-RADS classification+ CEUSpredictive model and the adjusted BI-RADS classification was 0.756, 0.828, 0.833,0.870, respectively.Before and after the adjustment of BI-RADS classification,the difference was statistically significant (Z=2.322, P<0.05). Conclusion: Thediagnostic efficiency that CEUS predictive model adjusted classification ofBI-RADS 4 breast masses is better, the method can reduce unnecessary biopsy.Publisher: 目的： 探讨超声造影(CEUS)检查对提高乳腺第5版乳腺影像报告和数据系统(BI－RADS) 4类肿块良恶性诊断的价值。 方法：收集2016年1月至2017年12月在山西医科大学第一医院就诊患者72例，最终经穿刺活检或手术病理结果确诊的乳腺肿块共79个。根据常规超声对所有肿块行BI－RADS分类，并行CEUS检查。根据CEUS预测模型结果，重新判定乳腺BI－RADS4类肿块良恶性：(1)常规超声BI－RADS分类＋CEUS预测模型：两者均提示恶性时诊断为恶性；(2)利用CEUS预测模型重新调整BI－RADS分类：若为恶性CEUS预测模型，则上调一类，若为良性CEUS预测模型，则下调一类。比较两种方法对乳腺BI－RADS 4类肿块良恶性的诊断效能。 结果：(1)79个乳腺肿块中，恶性肿块36个，良性肿块43个；常规超声BI－RADS分类、CEUS预测模型、常规超声BI－RADS分类＋CEUS预测模型及调整后BI－RADS分类诊断的敏感度、特异度、准确性、阳性预测值、阴性预测值分别为86.1%、65.1%、74.7%、67.4%、84.8%；88.9%、76.7%、82.3%、76.2%、89.2%；80.6%、86.0%、83.5%、82.9%、84.1%；97.2%、76.7%、86.1%、77.8%、97.1%。(2)以病理结果为金标准，常规超声BI－RADS分类、CEUS预测模型、常规超声BI－RADS分类＋CEUS预测模型及调整后BI－RADS分类ROC曲线下面积分别为0.756、0.828、0.833、0.870，调整前、后BI－RADS分类比较差异有统计学意义(Z＝2.322，P<0.05)。 结论：利用CEUS预测模型调整乳腺BI－RADS 4类肿块分类后诊断效能更高，可以减少不必要的穿刺活检。.PMID: 29804418
