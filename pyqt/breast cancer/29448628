In this study, we proposethe use of SPIONs encapsulated with antibody-conjugated poly(lactic-co-glycolicacid) (PLGA) as a potent theragnostic agent. The SPIONs were synthesized by achemical co-precipitation method of ferric and ferrous ions, and subsequentlyencapsulated with PLGA by using an emulsification-diffusion method. Herceptin waschemically conjugated to the SPION-encapsulating PLGA nanoparticles to target thehuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu) overexpressing breastcancers. FACS and MR molecular imaging revealed that the Her2/neu overexpressing cell line showed a stronger contrast enhancement than the Her2/neu non-expressingcell lines, and the signal intensity of in vivo MR imaging decreased as theconcentration of Herceptin increased. This strategy of encapsulating SPIONs with PLGA will be highly useful in functionalizing magnetic nanoparticles andimproving the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of a wide array of cancertreatments.DOI: 10.1166/jnn.2018.14220 PMID: 29448628  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
