Here, we address molecular and clinical features associated with GATA3mutations. A novel classification scheme defines distinct clinical features forpatients bearing breast tumors with mutations in the second GATA3 zinc-finger(ZnFn2). An engineered ZnFn2 mutant cell line by CRISPR-Cas9 reveals thatmutation of one allele of the GATA3 second zinc finger (ZnFn2) leads to loss ofbinding and decreased expression at a subset of genes, including ProgesteroneReceptor. At other loci, associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition,gain of binding correlates with increased gene expression. These resultsdemonstrate that not all GATA3 mutations are equivalent and that ZnFn2 mutations impact breast cancer through gain and loss-of function.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03478-4 PMCID: PMC5849768PMID: 29535312
