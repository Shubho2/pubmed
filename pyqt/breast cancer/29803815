Multiple intervention approaches havebeen developed to promote screening through direct patient education andempowerment approaches (i.e., training community members to share BCinformation). This study compares the relative effects of these approaches on: 1)women's BC screening; and, 2) women's dissemination of BC information withintheir social networks.DESIGN/METHODS: Our quasi-experimental trial is being implemented in communityvenues in two predominantly Latino neighborhoods in South and West Chicago.Eligible participants: 1) are female; 2) are 52-74 years old; 3) have notobtained a mammogram in the past 2 years; and, 4) have not previouslyparticipated in health-related volunteerism. Based on their geographic location, participants are assigned to one of two group-based interventions. Bothinterventions consist of three two-hour sessions, which includes BC earlydetection education. The education intervention sessions also covers BCprevention (diet, physical activity), whereas the empowerment intervention coverssharing information with family/friends, and health volunteerism. Navigation isprovided for all women who wish to obtain mammograms. Primary outcomes include:1) receipt of BC screening; and, 2) participants' dissemination of BCinformation. Secondary outcomes include positive changes in 1) participants'self-reported psychosocial facilitators; and, 2) social network members' BCbehaviors.DISCUSSION: The design of our program allows for a preliminary comparison of the effectiveness of these two approaches. This work will inform largercomparativeness trials and offers a new approach to intervention evaluation viasocial network analysis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
