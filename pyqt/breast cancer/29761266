Some studiesdemonstrated that treatment of breast cancer by RT can expose thyroid gland tohigh doses of radiation. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluateconsideration of thyroid gland as an organ at risk.METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis to select initial studies, acomprehensive search by two independent reviewers was performed. Electronicaldatabases following: Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Elsevier,Embase, ProQuest and Persian databases such as Iranmedex, Magiran, and SID weresearched. All searches were restricted to English language between 1985 and 2017.A random effect meta-analysis is applied to estimate pooled effect size acrossinitial studies. Funnel plot with Egger's test is used to assess potentialpublication bias.RESULTS: Totally, five studies (478 samples) were included in meta-analysis. The meta-analyses of result showed that thyroid gland is affected by radiotherapysignificantly and the TSH increased after radiotherapy (z = 2.68, P = 0.007). Thepooled estimate of difference mean for TSH was 0.90 (95% CI 0.24, 1.55). Instudies among patients with breast cancer RT, hypothyroidism was reported morethan other thyroid disorders. There was not showed possibility publication biasamong studies (P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that thyroid gland is affected byradiotherapy significantly and the TSH increased after radiotherapy. Protectingthyroid gland during radiation and follow-up of patients with breast cancer RTare suggested for the assessment of thyroid gland dysfunction.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1875-7 PMID: 29761266
