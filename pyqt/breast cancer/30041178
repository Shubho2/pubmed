Vicenzo di Taormina, Taormina, Italy.Liver metastases are very common in metastatic breast cancer (MBC); currenttreatments for these lesions are based on systemic chemotherapy, endocrine- orhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy, and palliative therapy. However, no standard approach has been clearly identified for second andfurther chemotherapy lines in MBC patients. In the phase III clinical trialEMBRACE, eribulin was particularly effective in reducing liver lesions andimproving both overall survival and progression-free survival in liver MBCpatients. In this series, we collected 8 case reports of Italian clinicalpractice in which eribulin has shown significant efficacy in reducing livermetastases in MBC patients: complete response was reported in 2 patients, and 4patients achieved partial response. The treatment was well tolerated, thusconfirming that eribulin is a suitable therapeutic option for elderly patientsand for those who have metastatic HER2-negative disease. In the setting of MBC,the sequencing of therapeutic agents should consider expected response, sideeffects, tumor characteristics, and patient's preferences, in order tosuccessfully tailor the most appropriate therapy beyond earlier lines.© 2018 S.
