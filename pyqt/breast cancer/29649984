Recent humanand mouse studies have suggested that inhibiting peptidyl arginine deiminaseenzymes (PAD) may be a novel breast cancer therapy. Based on the similaritiesbetween human breast cancer and mammary cancer in dogs and cats, we hypothesized that PAD inhibitors would also be an effective treatment for mammary cancer inthese animals.METHODS: Canine and feline mammary cancer cell lines were treated withBB-Cl-Amidine (BB-CLA) and evaluated for viability and tumorigenicity.Endoplasmic reticulum stress was tested by western blot, immunofluorescence, and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Canineand feline mammary cancer xenograft models were created using NOD scid gamma(NSG) mice, and were treated with BB-CLA for two weeks.RESULTS: We found that BB-CLA reduced viability and tumorigenicity of canine and feline mammary cancer cell lines in vitro. Additionally, we demonstrated thatBB-CLA activates the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway in these cells bydownregulating 78 kDa Glucose-regulated Protein (GRP78), a potential target inbreast cancer for molecular therapy, and upregulating the downstream target gene DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 3 (DDIT3). Finally, we established a mousexenograft model of both canine and feline mammary cancer in which wepreliminarily tested the effects of BB-CLA in vivo.CONCLUSION: We propose that our established mouse xenograft models will be usefulfor the study of mammary cancer in dogs and cats, and furthermore, that BB-CLAhas potential as a novel therapeutic for mammary cancer in these species.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4323-8 PMCID: PMC5898062PMID: 29649984
