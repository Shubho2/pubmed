We enrolled 167 women who were more than 5 years after mastectomy and were activemembers of Breast Cancer Self-Help Groups (group A1). As a control group weenrolled 117 women after mastectomy - not members of such support groups (groupA2). For the evaluation of the quality of life in both groups we used thefollowing standardized questionnaires - EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 as well the Mini-MAC scale for the assessment of strategies of coping with disease.Results: Based on QLQ C30 scores, group A1 had better emotional functioning (p = 0.0005) and a higher general quality of life (p = 0.0259), whereas group A2 hadbetter role functioning (p = 0.0042). Based on QLQ BR23 scores, there werestatistically significant differences in body image (p = 0.0366) and lifeperspectives (p = 0.0313) in favor of group A1. In the control group, there wasa greater use of destructive coping strategies and anxious preoccupation (p =0.1957).Conclusions: Membership in Amazon groups improves functioning in breast cancerpatients that can also extend into a five-year period after treatment completion.DOI: 10.5114/wo.2018.74389 PMCID: PMC5909726PMID: 29692659
