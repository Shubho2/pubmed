Box 12622, Egypt.A new set of 4-phenylcoumarin derivatives was designed and synthesized aiming to introduce new tubulin polymerization inhibitors as anti-breast cancer candidates.All the target compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic effects against MCF-7cell line, where compounds 2f, 3a, 3b, 3f, 7a and 7b, showed higher cytotoxiceffect (IC50 = 4.3-21.2 μg/mL) than the reference drug doxorubicin(IC50 = 26.1 μg/mL), additionally, compounds 1 and 6b exhibited the same potency as doxorubicin (IC50 = 25.2 and 28.0 μg/mL, respectively). The thiazolidinonederivatives 3a, 3b and 3f with potent and selective anticancer effects towardsMCF-7 cells (IC50 = 11.1, 16.7 and 21.2 μg/mL) were further assessed for tubulin polymerization inhibition effects which showed that the three compounds werepotent tubulin polymerization suppressors with IC50 values of 9.37, 2.89 and6.13 μM, respectively, compared to the reference drug colchicine(IC50 = 6.93 μM). The mechanistic effects on cell cycle progression and inductionof apoptosis in MCF-7 cells were determined for compound 3a due to its potent andselective cytotoxic effects in addition to its promising tubulin polymerizationinhibition potency. The results revealed that compound 3a induced cell cyclecessation at G2/M phase and accumulation of cells in pre-G1 phase and preventedits mitotic cycle, in addition to its activation of caspase-7 mediating apoptosisof MCF-7 cells. Molecular modeling studies for compounds 3a, 3b and 3f werecarried out on tubulin crystallography, the results indicated that the compounds showed binding mode similar to the co-crystalized ligand; colchicine. Moreover,pharmacophore constructed models and docking studies revealed thatthiazolidinone, acetamide and coumarin moieties are crucial for the activity.Molecular dynamics (MD) studies were carried out for the three compounds over100 ps. MD results of compound 3a showed that it reached the stable state after30 ps which was in agreement with the calculated potential and kinetic energy of compound 3a.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
