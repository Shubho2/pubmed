We consideredtimely follow-up to be within 15 days of the screening mammogram. Generalizedestimating equation models were used to evaluate the association between modes ofcommunication with patients and providers and timely follow-up, adjusting forPROSPR site, patient age, and race and ethnicity.RESULTS: The analysis included 34,680 mammography examinations with a BI-RADS 0assessment among 28 facilities. Across facilities, 85.6% of examinations had afollow-up within 15 days. Patients in a facility where routine practice was tocontact the patient by phone if follow-up imaging was recommended were morelikely to have timely follow-up (odds ratio [OR] 4.63, 95% confidence interval[CI] 2.76-7.76), whereas standard use of mail was associated with reduced timely follow-up (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.75). Facilities that had standard use ofelectronic medical records to report the need for follow-up imaging to a providerhad less timely follow-up (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.90). Facilities that routinely contacted patients by mail if they missed a follow-up imaging visit were morelikely to have timely follow-up (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.02-2.69).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the value of telephone communication topatients in relation to timely follow-up. Future research is needed to evaluatethe role of communication in completing the breast cancer screening episode.Copyright Â© 2018.
