Dairy consumption was examined during adolescence and earlyadulthood in relation to incident breast cancer in the Nurses' Health Study IIcohort.Methods: For the analyses of early adulthood dairy consumption, weincluded 90,503 premenopausal women ages 27 to 44 years in 1991 who reporteddairy consumption using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. From 1991 to2013, 3,191 invasive breast cancer cases were identified. In 1998, 44,264 womenrecalled adolescent dairy consumption. This subgroup of women was followed upfrom 1998 to 2013; 1,318 invasive breast cancer cases were identified.Multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) wereestimated using the Cox proportional hazard regression.Results: Adolescent andearly adulthood total dairy consumption was not associated with overall breastcancer risk (each serving/day during adolescence, total dairy HR = 1.02, 95% CI, 0.97-1.07; for early adulthood total dairy HR = 1.01, 95% CI, 0.97-1.04), as wereintakes of calcium, vitamin D, and lactose. Adolescent consumption of total andhigh-fat dairy was associated with higher risk of estrogen and progesteronereceptor negative (each serving/day: total dairy HR = 1.11, 95% CI, 1.00-1.24;high-fat dairy HR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.04-1.31). However, higher adolescent high-fatdairy consumption was associated with lower risk of estrogen and progesteronereceptor positive tumors (each serving/day HR = 0.91, 95% CI,0.86-0.97).Conclusions: Our results suggest no overall association between dairy consumption during adolescence or early adulthood and breast cancer risk, but thefindings may differ by hormone receptor status of tumors.Impact: Dairyconsumption in adolescence or early adulthood may not be a significant predictor of breast cancer incidence.
