We are taking a synthetic lethalapproach to identify druggable vulnerabilities in CDH1-mutant cancers.METHODS: Density distributions of cell viability data from a genome-wide RNAiscreen of isogenic MCF10A and MCF10A-CDH1-/- cells were used to identify protein classes affected by CDH1 mutation. The synthetic lethal relationship betweenselected protein classes and E-cadherin was characterised by drug sensitivityassays in both the isogenic breast MCF10A cells and CDH1-isogenic gastricNCI-N87. Endocytosis efficiency was quantified using cholera toxin B uptake.Pathway metagene expression of 415 TCGA gastric tumours was statisticallycorrelated with CDH1 expression.RESULTS: MCF10A-CDH1-/- cells showed significantly altered sensitivity to RNAiinhibition of groups of genes including the PI3K/AKT pathway, GPCRs, ionchannels, proteosomal subunit proteins and ubiquitinylation enzymes. BothMCF10A-CDH1-/- and NCI-N87-CDH1-/- cells were more sensitive than wild-type cellsto compounds that disrupted plasma membrane composition and trafficking, butshowed contrasting sensitivities to inhibitors of actin polymerisation and thechloride channel inhibitor NS3728. The MCF10A-CDH1-/- cell lines showed reducedcapacity to endocytose cholera toxin B. Pathway metagene analysis identified 20Reactome pathways that were potentially synthetic lethal in tumours. Genesinvolved in GPCR signalling, vesicle transport and the metabolism of PI3K andmembrane lipids were strongly represented amongst the candidate synthetic lethal genes.CONCLUSIONS: E-cadherin loss leads to disturbances in receptor signalling andplasma membrane trafficking and organisation, creating druggable vulnerabilities.DOI: 10.1007/s10120-018-0859-1 PMID: 30066183
