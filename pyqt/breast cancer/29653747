MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in cancermetastasis. In this study, we aimed to analyze the expression and function ofmiR-449a in breast cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 15 human primary breast cancer tissues andadjacent non-cancerous tissues (10 pairs) were obtained. MiR-449a was examined intumor tissues and adjacent nontumorous tissues of breast cancer patients and celllines by real-time PCR. The protein expression levels were analyzed by westernblot and immunohistochemistry staining. Luciferase reporter assays was used tovalidate the target of miR-449a. The effect of miR-449a on breast cancer cellmigration and invasion were studied in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-449a were significantly decreased in breastcancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-449a suppressed breastcancer cell proliferation, clone formation, migration, invasion and metastasis invitro and in vivo. Pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2 (PLAGL2) was identified as amajor target of miR-449a. Both overexpression of miR-449a inhibited theexpression of PLAGL2 significantly and the knockdown of PLAGL2 expressioninhibited the breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the miR-449a tumor suppressor role in breast cancercell migration and invasion via targeting PLAGL2. These findings suggesting that miR-449a/PLAGL2 could serve as a therapeutic strategy for targeting breastcancer.Copyright Â© 2018.
