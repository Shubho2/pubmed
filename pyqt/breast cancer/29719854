IVIM (fIVIM and D*) and non-Gaussian diffusion (ADC0 and K)parameters using 16 b values, plus synthetic apparent diffusion coefficients(sADCs) from 2 key b values (b = 200 and 1500 s/mm2) were calculated usingregions of interest. ADC0 maps of the whole breast were generated and theircontrast patterns were evaluated by two independent readers using retroareolarand segmental semi-quantitative scores. To compare the diffusion and IVIMparameters, Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used between pre- andpost-breastfeeding and Mann-Whitney tests were used between post-weaning and pre-or post-breastfeeding.Results: ADC0 and sADC values significantly decreased post-breastfeeding (1.90vs. 1.72 × 10-3 mm2/s, P < 0.001 and 1.39 vs. 1.25 × 10-3 mm2/s, P < 0.001) whileK values significantly increased (0.33 vs. 0.44, P < 0.05). fIVIM valuessignificantly increased after breastfeeding (1.97 vs. 2.97%, P < 0.01). Nosignificant difference was found in D* values. There was significantheterogeneity in ADC0 maps post-breastfeeding, both in retroareolar and segmentalscores (P < 0.0001 and =0.0001).Conclusion: IVIM and non-Gaussian diffusion parameters significantly changedbetween pre- and post-breastfeeding status, and care needs to be taken ininterpreting diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data in lactating breasts.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejro.2018.01.003 PMCID: PMC5926247PMID: 29719854
