However, its exact mechanisms ininhibiting tumor growth remain unknown. This study thus observed the effect ofsclareol on the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells, in an attempt to investigatethe role of sclarcol on osteosarcoma growth. MG63 osteosarcoma cell was treatedwith different concentrations of sclarcol. CCK8 assay was used to test its effecton cell proliferation. LC50 value was then determined to obtain optimal treatmentdose. MG63 cells were then divided into control and drug treated group, formeasuring apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry, andthe expression of cytochrome c, Bax and Bcl-2 by western blot. CCK8 analysisshowed that sclareol inhibited MG63 cell proliferation, with an LC50 value at11.0 μM. Flow cytometry results showed the apoptotic cell ratio was 13.8%, 24.1% and 37.3% after treated with 2.0 μM, 4.0 μM and 8.0 μM sclareol respectively.Compared to control group, sclareol significantly depressed mitochondrialmembrane potential of MG63 cells, increased the expression of cytochrome c andBax, but decreased Bcl-2 expression. In conclusion, Sclareol can inhibit theproliferation of MG63 cells, and induce cell apoptosis and decrease mitochondrialmembrane potential suggesting the inhibition of osteosarcoma cells by sclareolmight be via both apoptosis induction and decreasing mitochondrial membranepotential.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-170698 PMID: 29562495
