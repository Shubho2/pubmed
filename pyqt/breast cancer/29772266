Here, we crossed a mousestrain with germline deletion of PTEN PDZ-BD with MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model, and found that knockout (KO) mice display normal development of mammary glands,but have both increased breast tumorigenicity and lung metastasis. Orthotopicallograft experiments suggest the loss of PTEN PDZ-BD in breast cancer cellsrather than in tumor microenvironment plays a prominent role in increasing tumor burden. Through RNA-sequencing, we observed a significant downregulation ofmyoepithelial marker genes in both KO primary breast cancer and orthotopicallografts. Moreover, these myoepithelial marker genes are significantlydownregulated in human breast cancer tissues, and are associated with poorerclinical prognosis. In addition, several homeobox genes were also identified tobe downreguated in KO breast cancer, whose expressions showed significantpositive correlation with myoepithelial marker genes. Overall, our findingssuggest a novel tumor suppressive role of PTEN PDZ-BD in a murine model of breastcancer, and the mechanism involves the dysregulation of homeobox genes which may result in defective myoepithelial differentiation in breast cancer cells.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
