Currently, thecurative effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been recognized in moreand more people worldwide; however, the specific effect has not beensystematically evaluated. The purpose of this cohort study is to evaluate theclinical effects of TCM syndrome differentiation on recurrence and metastasisrate, survival rate, and the quality of life in patients with TNBC.METHODS: This study is a multicenter observational cohort trial taking 2 years. Atotal of 620 patients will be allocated at a ratio of 1:1 to receive TCM or not. The primary outcomes are progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival(OS), which are calculated at the end of the trial. Secondary outcomes includeTCM symptoms, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), ECOG score, EuropeanOrganization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Breast-Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BR23), as well as clinical indicatorsincluding tumor markers, immune function evaluation, chest computedtomography/magnetic resonance imaging, and abdominal B-ultrasound. Assessmentswill be performed at baseline and 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 weeks afterobservation.DISCUSSION: This will be the first clinical trial to evaluate the PFS and OS inTNBC patients receiving TCM, which may be used to assess the feasibility of alarger-scale clinical trial in the future, and formulate a standardized TCMtreatment plan.STUDY REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03332368).DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011061 PMCID: PMC6023942PMID: 29923998  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
