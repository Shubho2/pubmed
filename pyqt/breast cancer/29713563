Therefore, we compared the pathological characteristicsat diagnosis between self-detected and screen-detected cases of invasive breastcancer at our institution and determined whether these characteristics weredifferent after the program's introduction (vs. prior to).Methods: Three databases were selected (breast cancer diagnosed in 1995-2000,2010, and 2015), which provided a total of 3,014 female patients with invasivebreast cancer. The cases were divided into self-detected and screen-detectedgroups. The pathological characteristics were compared between the two groups andmultiple imputation and complete randomized imputation were used to deal withmissing data.Results: Compared with patient self-reporting, screening was associated with the following factors: a higher percentage of stage T1 tumors (75.0% vs 17.1%, P =0.109 in 1995-2000; 66.7% vs 40.4%, P < 0.001 in 2010; 67.8% vs 35.7%, P < 0.001 in 2015); a higher percentage of tumors with stage N0 lymph node status (67.3%vs. 48.4%, P = 0.007 in 2010); and a higher percentage of histologic grade Itumors (22.9% vs 13.9%, P = 0.017 in 2010).Conclusion: Screen-detected breast cancer was associated with a greater number offavorable pathological characteristics. However, although screening had abeneficial role in early detection in China, we found fewer patients weredetected by screening in this study compared with those in Western and Asiandeveloped countries.DOI: 10.7717/peerj.4567 PMCID: PMC5924684PMID: 29713563
