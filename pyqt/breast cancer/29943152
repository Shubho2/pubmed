This is a prospective observational study of Italian breast cancerpatients treated with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide (AC), assessed CINVincidence, adherence to national antiemetic guidelines (AIOM 2012), and therelationship with CINV outcomes.METHODS: Patients with breast cancer scheduled to receive their first cycle of anAC-based regimen were enrolled at 12 Italian centers and their clinical dataprospectively recorded. CINV incidence was assessed from patient diaries afterthe first chemotherapy cycle. The relationship between guideline adherence andCINV outcomes was examined using multiple logistic regression.RESULTS: The overall incidence rates of nausea and vomiting among 246 evaluablepatients were 63.0 and 25.4%, respectively. Most patients received a 5-HT3-RAagent and dexamethasone for acute phase CINV prophylaxis, whereas a triplecombination including aprepitant (NK1-RA), consistent with national guidelines,was used in only 45.5% of cases. In the delayed phase, the guideline adherencewas 48.8%, while the overall adherence was 43.5%. After adjusting for confoundingfactors, adherence to antiemetic prophylaxis guidelines was associated with asignificant reduction in the odds of three endpoints, namely any nausea,"significant nausea," and vomiting (OR = 0.49, OR = 0.54, and OR = 0.48,respectively), and a 90% increase in the odds of overall complete protection(OR = 1.90).CONCLUSIONS: CINV is still a critical issue in AC-treated patients, despiteantiemetic treatment. Non-adherence to antiemetic guidelines may lead to pooreroutcomes and indicates the need for strategies to enhance the use of guidelinesin clinical practice.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4259-1 PMID: 29943152
