[Epub ahead of print]Pioglitazone induces hypoxia-inducible factor 1 activation in human renalproximal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2.Urakami-Takebayashi Y(1), Kuroda Y(1), Murata T(1), Miyazaki M(1), Nagai J(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pharmaceutics, Osaka University of Pharmaceutical Sciences,4-20-1 Nasahara, Takatsuki, Osaka, 569-1094, Japan.(2)Department of Pharmaceutics, Osaka University of Pharmaceutical Sciences,4-20-1 Nasahara, Takatsuki, Osaka, 569-1094, Japan. Electronic address:jnagai@gly.oups.ac.jp.We previously reported that fatty acid-bearing albumin but not fattyacid-depleted albumin induces hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activation inhuman renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2. Then, an increase in mRNAexpression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) wasobserved on treatment with fatty acid-bearing albumin but not fatty acid-depletedalbumin. The aim of this study was to determine whether a PPARγ agonist,pioglitazone, induces HIF-1 activation or not. Treatment with pioglitazoneinduced HIF-1α mRNA as well as PPARγ mRNA expression in a concentration dependentmanner. In addition, pioglitazone increased HIF-1 target genes such as the mRNAs of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and breast cancer resistance protein(BCRP/ABCG2), in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistent with the increases in GLUT1 and ABCG2 mRNAs, protein expression of GLUT1 and BCRP was increased bypioglitazone. In addition, GLUT inhibitor phloretin-sensitive D-[3H]glucoseuptake activity and BCRP inhibitor Ko143-sensitive accumulation of Hoecsht33342, a BCRP substrate, were significantly enhanced by treatment with pioglitazone.These findings suggest that PPARγ activation by pioglitazone leads to HIF-1protein expression induction followed by changes in HIF-1 target gene expression and protein product activity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
