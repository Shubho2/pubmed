The expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor(PR), HER2 and Ki-67 was determined in pre- and post-NAC specimens. McNemar'stest was used to compare paired proportions.Results: Among patients with residual disease after NAC, basal phenotype wasluminal A, luminal B, HER2 positive and triple negative in 44, 111, 74 and 27cases, respectively. PR-positive tumors decreased from 68.0% in the initialbiopsy sample to 61.7% in the surgical specimen (p = 0.024). A Ki-67 of < 20%increased from 23.6% to 45% (p < 0.001). ER expression changed from positive tonegative in 5% and from negative to positive in 16.7% of cases. Overall, 30% ofcases underwent subtype changes, 79% of them towards luminal differentiation.Conclusions: The switch towards luminal phenotype suggests some kind of endocrineeffect of NAC. Our findings raise renewed interest in combinatorial cytotoxicchemotherapy with concomitant or rather sequential endocrine therapy, eitheralone or with targeted agents.DOI: 10.1159/000479582 PMCID: PMC5803695 [Available on 2018-12-01]PMID: 29456471
