Accumulatingevidence has elucidated them as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in cancers such ashepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer (Liu et al.,Gastroenterology 136:683-693, 2009; Yu et al., Cell 131:1109-1123, 2007; Zhou et al., Sci Rep 7:42680, 2017; Iorio and Croce, Carcinogenesis 33:1126-1133, 2012). MiRNAs are involved in various biological processes, including cell proliferation(Liu et al., Mol Cancer Res 11:1314-1325, 2013), differentiation (Liu et al., MolCancer Res 11:1314-1325, 2013), apoptosis (Pan et al., Oncol Res 24:429-435,2016), invasion and metastasis (Liu et al., Nat Commun 8:14270, 2017).Understanding the role of miRNAs in tumor gives new perspective on cancerdiagnosis and therapy (Rupaimoole and Slack, Nat Rev Drug Discov 16:203-222,2017; Berindan-Neagoe et al., CA Cancer J Clin 64:311-336, 2014). This chapterwill focus on the in vitro methods for identifying miRNAs roles in cellproliferation, invasion, and metastasis in tumor development, which includesCCK-8 assay, Wound Healing assay, and Transwell assay.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7601-0_13 PMID: 29435931
