BRCA2-associated ovarian carcinomas predominantly possess a high-grade serous phenotype, which respond to platinum and targetedtherapy with PARP inhibitors. Presented here is the case of an adult patient withNSCNEC of the ovaries associated with a deleterious BRCA2 germline mutation. The pathogenic mutation was also confirmed on the somatic level, while the wild-type allele had a high variant fraction, suggesting loss of heterozygosity. To thebest of our knowledge, this is the first report of an adult BRCA2 germlinemutation carrier with the rare NSCNEC of the ovary phenotype. Therefore, ovarian cancer patients with histological subtypes other than high-grade serouscarcinomas should be tested for BRCA1/2 mutations, as they may benefit fromtargeted therapy with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7836 PMCID: PMC5835890PMID: 29541174
