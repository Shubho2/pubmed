[Epub ahead ofprint]Commentary ACOG Practice Bulletin July 2017: Breast Cancer Risk Assessmentand Screening in Average-Risk Women.Mango V(1), Bryce Y(2), Morris EA(1), Gianotti E(1), Pinker K.Author information: (1)1 Department of Radiology, Breast Imaging Service, Memorial Sloan KetteringCancer Center , New York, NY , USA.(2)2 Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Division ofMolecular and Gender Imaging, Medical University of Vienna , Vienna , Austria.Screening mammography reduces breast cancer mortality in average-risk women.However, adverse consequences include false-positive findings possibly leading tobenign breast biopsies and patient anxiety. There is also potential foroverdiagnosis and overtreatment. Differences in how to balance benefits and harmshave led to varying recommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,the American Cancer Society, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and theAmerican College of Radiology/Society of Breast Imaging. These recommendationsdiffer with respect to what age to start, what age to stop, and frequency ofscreening in average-risk women. Most recently, the American College ofObstetricians and Gynecologists have issued updated clinical managementguidelines for breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women that aim to maximize the benefits of screening while keeping in mind thepotential harms of false-positive results. This commentary summarizes theclinical management guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists Practice Bulletin July 2017 for breast cancer risk assessment andscreening in average-risk women. We review evidence of the benefits and adverseconsequences of screening mammography and briefly discuss new advances in breast cancer screening with recent technologies such digital breast tomosynthesis andrisk-adapted screening.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20170907 PMID: 29688040
