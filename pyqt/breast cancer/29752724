Preeclampsia, a pregnancycomplication, is associated with reduced maternal breast cancer risk. However,questions remain regarding causality, biological mechanisms and the relation ofother hypertensive conditions to risk. We conducted a population-basedcase-control study of breast cancer cases (n = 116,196) in parous womenidentified through linkage of birth and cancer registries in Denmark, Finland,Norway and Sweden (1967-2013), including up to 10 matched controls per case (n = 1,147,192) sampled from the birth registries (complete data were not available onall variables). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) werederived from unconditional logistic regression models including matching factors (country, maternal birth year) and parity. Hypertension diagnosed beforepregnancy (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.78-0.97), gestational hypertension (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.86-0.93) and preeclampsia (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.88-0.95) were associated withreduced breast cancer risk. Results remained similar after adjustment for smokingand maternal body mass index before first pregnancy, and were generally similarstratified by parity, age at breast cancer diagnosis, time since first and lastbirth, sex of the offspring and calendar time. Except for retained placenta (OR1.14; 95% CI 0.98-1.32), no other pregnancy complication appeared associated withbreast cancer risk. The mechanisms mediating the modest risk reductions forhistory of preeclampsia or hypertension preceding or arising during pregnancy,and possible increased risk with history of retained placenta are unknown andwarrant further laboratory, clinical and epidemiological investigation.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31600 PMID: 29752724
