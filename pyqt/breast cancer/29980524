In a prospective, multicenter cohort study,consecutive adult patients with a solid tumor and implanted port underwent12-month follow-up. Our primary objective was to identify risk factors for (1)catheter-related thrombosis, defined as ipsilateral symptomatic upper-limbdeep-vein thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism, and (2) venousthromboembolism other than catheter-related, defined as any symptomaticsuperficial- or deep-vein thrombosis (other than catheter-related) or pulmonaryembolism, and incidental pulmonary embolism. All events were objectivelyconfirmed and centrally adjudicated. Rate assessments integrated the competingrisk of death. Overall, 3032 patients were included (median age: 63 years; women:58%). The most frequent cancer locations were breast (33.7%), lung (18.5%) andcolorectal (15.6%), cancer being metastatic in 43.2% of patients. Most patients(97.1%) received chemotherapy. By 12 months, 48 (1.6%) patients had been lost to follow-up and 656 (24.6%) had died; 3.8% (n=111) of patients had experiencedcatheter-related thrombosis, and 9.6% (n=276) venous thromboembolism other thancatheter-related. By multivariate analysis, use of the cephalic vein for catheterinsertion predicted catheter-related thrombosis, whereas ongoing antiplatelettherapy was protective; risk factors for venous thromboembolism other thancatheter-related were advanced age, previous venous thromboembolism, cancer site,and low hemoglobin level or increased leukocyte count before chemotherapy. Inconclusion, this large prospective cohort study showed a high rate of venousthromboembolism in patients with a solid tumor and implanted port. Risk factorsfor catheter-related thrombosis differed from those for venous thromboembolismnot catheter-related.
