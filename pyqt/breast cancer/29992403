Experiments were conducted with SKOV3 human ovarian cancercells and MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells to evaluate the anti-tumor effects.RESULTS: 17-AAG/MTSLs-FA prepared in this study met the basic requirements fortherapeutic application. The preparation method is relatively simple and the raw materials are readily available. The product exhibited strong magnetism, highencapsulation efficiencies, and satisfactory performance. The liposomes combined with hyperthermia significantly inhibited the proliferation of SKOV3 cells andinduced apoptosis. Experiments using a mouse subcutaneous model as well as anascites tumor xenograft model indicated that 17-AAG/MTSLs-FA was stable in vivoand effectively targeted tumor tissues expressing the folate receptor.CONCLUSIONS: Folic acid-conjugated 17-AAG magnetic thermosensitive liposomes incombination with an alternating magnetic field for heating can achieve asynergistic anti-tumor effect of chemotherapy and heat treatment, potentiallyoffering a new method for ovarian cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s11523-018-0577-y PMID: 29992403
