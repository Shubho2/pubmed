[Epub ahead of print]High levels of serum CA15-3 and residual invasive tumor size are associated with poor prognosis for breast cancer patients with non-pathological complete responseafter neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Fujimoto Y(1), Higuchi T(1), Nishimukai A(1), Miyagawa Y(1), Kira A(1), OzawaH(1), Bun A(1), Imamura M(1), Miyoshi Y(1).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Division of Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Hyogo Collegeof Medicine, Nishinomiya City, Hyogo, Japan.BACKGROUND: To identify surrogate markers for prognosis of breast cancer patientswith non-pathological complete response (non-pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NAC), our investigation focused on serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA15-3) as well as clinicopathological factorsboth pre- and post-NAC.METHODS: A total of 185 breast cancer patients treated with NAC were recruited.Serum CEA and CA15-3 were measured at baseline and at completion of NAC.RESULTS: Among the non-pCR cancers (n = 142), disease-free survival (DFS) ofpatients with CA15-3-low at baseline (3-year DFS: 0.908, n = 73) wassignificantly better than of those with CA15-3-high (3-year DFS: 0.681, n = 69,P = 0.0134). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that baseline CA15-3 levels(hazard ratio (HR): 3.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-10.23; P = 0.0122)and residual invasive size (HR: 4.47, 1.26-28.39; P = 0.0171) were significantindependent factors for DFS. The combination of these factors proved to beaccurate predictor for DFS regardless of breast cancer subtypes.CONCLUSIONS: The combination of residual invasive size and serum CA15-3 levels atbaseline seems to be a significant and independent surrogate marker of pooroutcome for patients with non-pCR. These findings suggest that these markers may be useful for identifying patients with inferior prognosis and candidates foradditional adjuvant treatments.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jso.25125 PMID: 29936704
