Consequently, these patients would benefit fromthe identification of new prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Theexpression of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1) has recently been shown to be an indicator of advanced stage breast cancer.Therefore, we investigated its expression and prognostic value of GIT1 in acohort of 140 ER+ breast cancer with synchronous lymph node involvement. Methods:Immunohistochemistry was employed to assess GIT1 expression in a tissuemicroarray (TMA) containing duplicate non-adjacent cores with matched primarytumour and lymph node tissue (n=140). GIT1 expression in tumour cells was scored and statistical correlation analyses were carried out. Results: The resultsrevealed a sub-group of patients that displayed discordant expression of GIT1between the primary tumour and the lymph nodes (i.e. spatial intratumouralheterogeneity). We observed that loss of GIT1 expression in the tumour cells ofthe metastasis was associated with a shorter time to recurrence, poorer overallsurvival, and a shorter median survival time. Moreover, multivariate analysisdemonstrated that GIT1 expression was an independent prognostic indicator.Conclusions: GIT1 expression enabled the identification of a sub-class of ER+patients with lymph node metastasis that have a particularly poor prognosticoutcome. We propose that this biomarker could be used to further stratify ER+breast cancer patients with synchronous lymph node involvement and thereforefacilitate adjuvant therapy decision making.DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.12393.2 PMCID: PMC5843846PMID: 29862012
