Due to the structural similarity between phosphinothricin and somebisphosphonates (BPs), this study focuses on investigating the possibility ofrepurposing phosphinothricin as a bisphosphonate analogue, particularly in twomedicine-related activities: image probing and as an anti-cancer drug. As BP is acompetitive inhibitor of human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (HFPPS), in silicomolecular docking and dynamic simulations studies were established to evaluatethe binding and stability of phosphinothricin with HFPPS, while the resultsshowed good binding and stability in the active site of the enzyme in relation toalendronate. For the purpose of inspecting bone-tissue accumulation ofphosphinothricin, a technetium (99mTc)-phosphinothricin complex was developed andits stability and tissue distribution were scrutinized. The radioactive complexshowed rapid, high and sustained uptake into bone tissues. Finally, the cytotoxicactivity of phosphinothricin was tested against breast and lung cancer cells,with the results indicating cytotoxic activity in relation to alendronate. Allthe above results provide support for the use of phosphinothricin as a potential anti-cancer drug and of its technetium complex as an imaging probe.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23020496 PMID: 29473879
