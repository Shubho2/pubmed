Here, we explored the efficacy of next‑generation sequencing (NGS) inpredicting the classification of benign and malignant thyroid nodules and lymphnode metastasis status, and simultaneously compared the results withultrasound (US). Thyroline was designed to detect 15 target gene mutations and2 fusions in 98 formalin‑fixed, paraffin‑embedded (FFPE) tissues, including thosefrom 82 thyroid cancer (TC) patients and 16 patients with benign nodules. BRAFmutations were found in 57.69% of the papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cases, whileRET mutations were detected among all the medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cases.Multiple mutations were positive but none showed dominance in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC). The sensitivity and specificityof NGS prediction in differentiation of benign and malignant thyroid nodules were79.27 and 93.75%, respectively, and the positive predictive value (PPV) andnegative predictive value (NPV) were 98.48 and 46.88%, respectively. Thesens-itivity and specificity of US were 76.83 and 6.25%, respectively, and thePPV and NPV were 80.77 and 5.00%, respectively. The area under curve (AUC) of NGSand US were 0.865 and 0.415, respectively. A total of 27 patients had≥1 metastases to lymph nodes, 19 of which carried mutations, including BRAF, RET,NRAS, PIK3CA, TP53, CTNNB1 and PTEN. However, there was no correlation betweenthe variant allele frequency of specific gene mutations and the number ofmetastatic lymph nodes. In conclusion, the prediction value of NGS was higherthan the US‑based Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI‑RADS). NGS isvaluable for the accurate differentiation of benign and malignant thyroidnodules, and pathological subtypes in FFPE samples. The findings of the presentstudy may pave the way for the application of NGS in analyzing fine‑needleaspiration (FNA) biopsy samples.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6493 PMID: 29901149
