They can regulate chromosomestructure, gene expression and play an essential role in the pathophysiology ofhuman diseases, especially in tumorigenesis and progression. Nowadays, they arebeing targeted as potential biomarkers for various cancer types. And manyresearch studies have proven that lncRNAs might bring a new era to cancerdiagnosis and support treatment management. The purpose of this review was toinspect the molecular mechanism and clinical significance of long non-coding RNA-differentiation antagonizing nonprotein coding RNA(DANCR) in various types ofhuman cancers.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this review, we summarize and figure out recentresearch studies concerning the expression and biological mechanisms oflncRNA-DANCR in tumour development. The related studies were obtained through asystematic search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library.RESULTS: Long non-coding RNAs-DANCR is a valuable cancer-related lncRNA that its dysregulated expression was found in a variety of malignancies, includinghepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, glioma, colorectal cancer, gastriccancer, and lung cancer. The aberrant expressions of DANCR have been shown tocontribute to proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells.CONCLUSIONS: Long non-coding RNAs-DANCR likely serves as a useful diseasebiomarker or therapeutic cancer target.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
