As accumulating evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)regulate important cancer hallmarks, we hypothesised that AR-regulated lncRNAsmight play roles in TNBC progression. Here, we performed experiments with orwithout DHT treatment in three TNBC cell lines, and we identified an ARnegatively induced lncRNA (ARNILA), which correlated with poor progression-freesurvival (PFS) in TNBC patients and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT), invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, wedemonstrated that ARNILA functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) formiR-204 to facilitate expression of its target gene Sox4, which is known toinduce EMT and contribute to breast cancer progression, thereby promoting EMT,invasion and metastasis of TNBC. Our findings not only provide new insights into the mechanisms of lncRNA in regulating AR but also suggest ARNILA as analternative therapeutic target to suppress metastasis of TNBC patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41418-018-0123-6 PMID: 29844570
