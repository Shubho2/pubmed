Electronic address: p.r.dash@reading.ac.uk.Focal adhesions (FAs) play an important role in cancer cell migration andmetastasis by linking the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix,allowing the cell to generate traction. SUMOylation is a post-translationalmodification of proteins on lysine residues that can affect protein localisation,turnover and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we demonstrate thattalin, a key component of FAs, can be post-translationally modified bySUMOylation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and U2OS osteosarcoma cells.Furthermore we demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates the dynamic activities ofFAs including their number, size and turnover rate. Inhibiting SUMOylationsignificantly reduced the speed of cell migration. The identification of talin asa SUMO target provides insight into the mechanisms regulating focal adhesionformation and turnover and potentially identifies a novel mechanism underlyingcell migration.Copyright Â© 2018.
