However, the inefficiency of the traditional quantitative polymerasechain reaction (qPCR)-based MethyLight assay for detecting the extremely lowconcentration of methylated DNA fragments in body fluids limits its clinicalapplications. Here, we developed an ultrasensitive microwell chip digitalpolymerase chain reaction (dPCR)-based MethyLight assay. Using the synthesizedsamples, the developed MethyLight assay can achieve 103-104-fold lower limit ofdetection and 1-16-fold lower limit of quantification than the traditionalMethyLight assay. Four hypermethylated alleles (RARβ2, BRCA1, GSTP1 and RASSF1A) related to breast cancer in twenty-three clinical samples were tested using themicrowell chip dPCR-based MethyLight assay. The results showed that the dPCRassay achieves ∼2 times enhancement in the cancer detection rate over thetraditional quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the dPCR can detect the healthy andbenign samples, which are undetectable using the traditional MethyLight assay. Inmultiple gene analysis, we achieved the highest detection rate of 93.3% (in the"OR" format of RARβ2 and GSTP1). Lastly, the estimated cut-off values in the dPCRassay were: <1, ∼1 to 100 and >100 (copies per μL) referring to the healthy,benign and malignant breast cancers, respectively. Therefore, the developedmicrowell chip dPCR-based MethyLight assay could provide a powerful tool forcancer biopsy diagnosis and disease monitoring.DOI: 10.1039/c8an00205c PMID: 29693662
