Wecompared NSM/SSM followed by immediate reconstruction with CM in patients under35 years old by analyzing clinicopathologic features, breast cancer specificsurvival rate (BCSS), distant metastasis free survival rate (DMFS), and localrecurrence rate (LRR).RESULTS: Out of a total of 2889 patients, we performed NSM/SSM in 118 patientsand CM in 141 patients aged less than 35 years old. DMFS were 85.3% and 73.4% in NSM/SSM and CM, respectively (p = 0.001). BCSS were 90.7% and 73.0% in NSM/SSMand CM, respectively (p = 0.001). After adjusting for stage, there were nostatistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to DMFSand BCSS. The type of surgery was not a prognostic factor in multivariateanalysis for DMFS and BCSS (CM vs. NSM/SSM: DMFS HR = 0.67, p = 0.215; BCSS:HR = 0.66, p = 0.265).CONCLUSIONS: Compared to CM, NSM/SSM followed by immediate breast reconstruction is oncologically safe and could be a viable surgical treatment in young patients under 35 years old with breast cancer.Copyright © 2018.
