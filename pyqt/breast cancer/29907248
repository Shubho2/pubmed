Several studies have pointed out the important role of progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) in the development ofBC, especially with hormone therapy using progestins. Although the deregulationof microRNA-181a (miR-181a) is often associated with human BC, the effect ofmiR-181a on PGRMC1 expression during hormone therapy has not been investigated.METHODS: Cell viability assay and apoptosis assay were performed to investigatethe pro-BC effect of progestin (norethisterone, NET) and anti-BC effect ofmiR-181a on MCF-7 cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to evaluate gene expressions in the NET-treated MCF-7 cells.RESULTS: NET dose-dependently increased BC cell viability and this effect wasaccompanied by increased expression of PGRMC1. Overexpression of miR-181astrongly reduced the cell viability of MCF-7 cells, mainly through increasedapoptosis, which was evidenced by substantially increased gene expression ofpro-apoptosis factors such as BAX and CASPASE 9 in miR-181a overexpressed cells. Importantly, miR-181a abrogated NET-stimulated cell viability and PGRMC1expression.CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that miR-181a promotes MCF-7 cell apoptosis.Moreover, miR-181a suppressed NET-provoked cell viability and PGRMC1 expressionin MCF-7 cells. These data may suggest a therapeutic strategy of using miR-181ato reduce BC risk in progestin hormone replacement therapy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
