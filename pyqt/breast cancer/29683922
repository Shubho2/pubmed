[Epub aheadof print]A Review of Accelerometer-based Activity Monitoring in Cancer SurvivorshipResearch.Peddle-McIntyre CJ(1)(1), Cavalheri V(1)(1), Boyle T(1)(1), McVeigh JA(1)(1),Jeffery E(1)(1), Lynch BM(1)(1)(1), Vallance JK(1).Author information: (1)Exercise Medicine Research Institute, Edith Cowan University, Perth,Australia.BACKGROUND: In the cancer survivorship context, physical activity and sedentarybehaviour have been measured using different methods and tools.PURPOSE: To conduct a narrative review of published research in cancer survivorpopulations to summarise the quality and identify gaps in reporting onaccelerometer data collection, data processing, and outcome measures in cancersurvivors.METHODS: An initial PubMed® search of papers published in English was conductedin January 2017, and a final search was conducted in May 2017. Variablesextracted included study characteristics, methods for accelerometry datacollection (e.g., device used), data processing (e.g., cut points used), and datareporting (e.g., time spent in different activity intensities).RESULTS: A total of 46 papers were eligible for inclusion in the review. Themajority of studies (34 of 46) targeted a single cancer group and 18 of these 34 studies were in survivors of breast cancer. Half of the studies (54%) used anActiGraph® accelerometer. Methods of accelerometer data processing varied across studies. Definitions of non-wear time, vectors used during processing, andfilters applied during processing were reported by 51%, 60% and 8% of studies,respectively. Most studies reported MVPA (78%), 50% reported sedentary time, and 43% reported light intensity activity. Cut points to categorise these activities varied between studies.CONCLUSION: This narrative review highlights inconsistency in the methods used tocollect, process, and report accelerometry data across cancer survivor studies.Accelerometry has potential to add detailed knowledge of the levels and patterns of physical activities and sedentary behaviours across the cancer spectrum.Recommendations are made to improve data processing and reporting methods tomaximise the scientific validity of future accelerometer research in this field.DOI: 10.1249/MSS.0000000000001644 PMID: 29683922
