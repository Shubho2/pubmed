Electronicaddress: arthur.mercurio@umassmed.edu.Insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is an oncofetalprotein associated with many aggressive cancers and implicated in the function ofbreast cancer stem cells (CSCs). The mechanisms involved, however, are poorlyunderstood. We observed that IMP3 facilitates the activation of TAZ, atranscriptional co-activator of Hippo signaling that is necessary for thefunction of breast CSCs. The mechanism by which IMP3 activates TAZ involves both mRNA stability and transcriptional regulation. IMP3 stabilizes the mRNA of analternative WNT ligand (WNT5B) indirectly by repressing miR145-5p, which targets WNT5B, resulting in TAZ activation by alternative WNT signaling. IMP3 alsofacilitates the transcription of SLUG, which is necessary for TAZ nuclearlocalization and activation, by a mechanism that is also mediated by WNT5B.These results demonstrate that TAZ can be regulated by an mRNA-binding proteinand that this regulation involves the integration of Hippo and alternativeWNT-signaling pathways.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).
