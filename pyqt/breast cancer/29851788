Anti-Müllerian hormone receptor 2 (AMHR2) and C-Kit were two members of proteinkinase which were reported increased in some cancers like ovarian carcinoma andbreast cancer. The present study aimed to assess the expression of AMHR2 andc-Kit in cervical cancer of different differentiated degrees as well as incervicitis sections.METHODS: All the lesions were collected randomly during clinical observations in hospitals located in Xinjiang, China. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) andimmunohistochemical staining were used to detect AMHR2 and c-Kit expression incervical samples from women who had been infected with human papilloma virus(HPV)16. The expression rate was compared between cervical cancer of well,moderately and poorly differentiated and cervicitis.RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 45 years; ranged from 23 to 80. For AMHR2, all 17 cervicitis samples ranged from (++) to (++++), while cervicalcancer showed 11 (+), 9 (++), 15 (+++),9 (++++), and 8 (-), which showed AMHR2expression was lessen with the poorer of differentiation degree of cervicalcancer (P < .05). For c-Kit, 18 cervicitis samples mainly expressed as (-) withnone showed (+++) or (++++), while cervical cancer samples showed 7 (-), 6 (+), 1(++), 2 (+++), and 8 (++++), which indicated c-Kit's expression increased withthe reduction of cervical cancer's differentiation degree (P < .05).CONCLUSION: AMHR2 might have some correlation with self defense of our body,while c-Kit might link with the potential invasive capacity of cervical cancer.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010793 PMID: 29851788  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
