Specifically, wewished to find out if true positive and false negative results of IC wereassociated to axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND). Also, we addressed a comparativecost analysis between techniques.METHODS: 244 patients treated for breast cancer in the Breast Unit of HospitalGermans Trias i Pujol from 2011 to 2015 were prospectively included. Atransversal, consecutive design was applied to assess IC compared to thereference test (OSNA). Inclusion criteria were: T1 and T2 tumors with negativenodes, both clinically and on ultrasound.RESULTS: Sensitivity of IC for macrometastases was 70%. The NPV of IC formacrometastases was 95,75%. Accuracy of IC was 96,12%. In the comparative costanalysis, the release time of results for OSNA doubled that of IC and wasassociated with an increased cost of € 370.CONCLUSIONS: IC has been stated as a good technique for intraoperative cancerinvolvement SN with high sensitivity and NPV compared to the OSNA assay. Itallows keeping the whole node tissue and thus the possibility of improvedhistopathological evaluation, which can be useful for adjuvant, and offers theadvantage of being less time consuming. Cost analysis shows a higher cost forOSNA, which may exceed the benefit of sorting out false negatives from IC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
