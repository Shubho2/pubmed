The effect of lumretuzumab and pertuzumab was welldescribed by an Emax function indicating an increased rate of transition frommoderate to mild or more severe diarrhea with higher doses. The concentrationneeded to trigger or worsen diarrhea episodes was estimated to be 120-fold lower in combination therapy compared to monotherapy, suggesting strong synergy betweenthe two monoclonal antibodies. The prophylactic effect of loperamide in a subset of patients was also well captured by the model with a clear tendency to reducethe occurrence of diarrhea events.CONCLUSIONS: This work shows that PK-toxicity modeling provides insight into how the severity of key adverse events evolves over time and highlights the potentialuse to support decision making in drug development.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3621-9 PMID: 29915982
