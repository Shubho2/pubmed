In this work, we combined three label-free NLOM imaging methods toquantitatively characterize breast cancer cells and their relative invasivepotential: (i) TPEF optical redox ratio (ORR = FAD+/NADH + FAD+), (ii) coherentRaman scattering of cellular lipids, and (iii) second harmonic generation ofextracellular matrix (ECM) collagen. 3D spheroid models of primary mammaryepithelial (PME) cells and breast cancer cell lines (T47D and MDA-MB-231) werecharacterized based on their unique ORR and lipid volume fraction signatures.Treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2) increased glycolysis in both PME and T47D ER+breast cancer acini. However, PME cells displayed increased lipid content with noeffect on ECM, while T47D cells had decreased lipid storage (P < 0.001) andsignificant reorganization of collagen. By measuring deuterated lipidssynthesized from exogenously administered deuterium-labeled glucose, treatment ofT47D cells with E2 increased both lipid synthesis and consumption rates. Theseresults confirm that glucose is a significant source for the cellular synthesisof lipid in glycolytic breast cancer cells, and that the combination of cellular redox and lipid fraction imaging endpoints is a powerful approach with new andcomplementary information content.Significance: These findings provide uniqueinsight into metabolic processes, revealing correlations between cancermetastasis and cellular redox state, lipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix.
