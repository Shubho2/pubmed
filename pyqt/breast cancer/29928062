To this end, we generated novel antibodies to EMT-and CSC-associated proteins, including Goosecoid, Sox9, Slug, Snail, and CD133.Importantly, unlike several widely used antibodies to CD133, the anti-CD133antibodies we generated recognize epitopes distal to known glycosylation sites,enabling analyses that are not confounded by differences in CD133 glycosylation. For all target proteins, we selected antibodies that yielded the expected target protein molecular weights by Western analysis and the correct subcellularlocalization patterns by immunofluorescence microscopy assay (IFA); bindingselectivity was verified by immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry and byimmunohistochemistry and IFA peptide blocking experiments. Finally, we appliedthese reagents to assess modulation of the respective markers of EMT and CSCs in xenograft tumor models by IFA. We observed that the constitutive presence ofhuman hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) in the tumor microenvironment of H596non-small cell lung cancer tumors implanted in homozygous hHGF knock-intransgenic mice induced a more mesenchymal-like tumor state (relative to theepithelial-like state when implanted in control SCID mice), as evidenced by theelevated expression of EMT-associated transcription factors detected by our novelantibodies. Similarly, our new anti-CD133 antibody enabled detection andquantitation of drug-induced reductions in CD133-positive tumor cells followingtreatment of SUM149PT triple-negative breast cancer xenograft models with theCSC/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor VS-6063. Thus, our novel antibodies to CSC- and EMT-associated factors exhibit sufficient sensitivity and selectivityfor immunofluorescence microscopy studies of these processes in preclinicalxenograft tumor specimens and the potential for application with clinicalsamples.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199361 PMCID: PMC6013203PMID: 29928062
