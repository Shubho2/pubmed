China.Type 1 transforming growth factor β receptor (TGFBR1)*6A, a common hypomorphicvariant of TGFBR1, may act as a susceptibility allele in colorectal cancer.However, the contribution of TGFBR1*6A to colorectal cancer development islargely unknown. To test the hypothesis that TGFBR1*6A promotes colorectal cancerinvasion and metastasis via Smad-independent transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)signaling, the effect of TGFBR1*6A on the invasion of colorectal cancer cells wasassessed. pCMV5-TGFBR1*6A-HA plasmids were transfected into SW48 and DLD-1 cells by Lipofectamine-mediated DNA transfection. The effect of TGF-β1 on theproliferation of SW48 and DLD-1 cells transfected with TGFBR1*6A was determinedby MTT assay. The effects of the TGF-β1 on the invasion of the transfected SW48and DLD-1 cells were determined using Matrigel-coated plates. Transformingmigrating chambers were used to determine the effects of TGF-β1 on the migration of the transfected SW48 and DLD-1 cells. Western blot analysis was used todetermine the expression of phosphorylated (p-) extracellular-signal-regulatedkinase (ERK), p-P38 and p-SMAD family member 2 in SW48 cells. Using transfectedTGFBR1*6A SW48 and DLD-1 cell lines our group demonstrated that, in comparisonwith TGFBR1*9A, TGFBR1*6A is capable of switching TGF-β1 growth-inhibitorysignals into growth-stimulatory signals which significantly increased theinvasion of SW48 and DLD-1 cells. Functional assays indicated that TGFBR1*6Aweakened Smad-signaling but increased ERK and p38 signaling, which are crucialmediators of cell migration and invasion. From this, it was possible to conclude that TGFBR1*6A enhanced SW48 cell migration and invasion through themitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and that it may contribute to colorectalcancer progression in a TGF-β1/Smad signaling-independent manner. This suggeststhat TGFBR1*6A may possess oncogenic properties and that it may affect themigration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7725 PMCID: PMC5796273PMID: 29467907
