Immunomagnetic microbeads and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) havebeen extensively explored to isolate CTCs from blood samples. However, MNPsattached on the membrane protein are interrupted further analysis to distinguish the cancer subtype by consumption or blocking the target surface marker. Here, anMNP-mediated analysis method for surface marker expression profile by magneticforce microscopy (MFM) is described. Two MNPs, zinc ferrite and iron oxide, areshowed distinct phase shift (-16.5° and -3.7°, respectively) signal on the MFMimages. The antibody conjugated MNPs are successfully isolated target cellswithout giving damage to the cell. The MFM image of MNP decorated cells showclear differences between two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and SK-BR-3, which proof the cancer subtyping property using MFM method. To confirmation of thesurface marker consumption during the cell isolation, antibody-conjugated quantumdots and drug-loaded oleosome are treated on the cells, thereby MNP decoratedcells are survived. This newly developed MFM analysis method provides a newdirection to utilize the MNP for the surface marker expression phenotypes.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
