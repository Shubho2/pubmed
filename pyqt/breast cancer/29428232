Groups werecompared with respect to re-excision rates, conversion to mastectomy, specimenvolumes, mean cost per patient of surgical care, and prospectively collectedpatient post-procedure quality of life.RESULTS: A total of 237 patients who underwent partial mastectomy were examined(n = 126 in the PRE group and n = 111 in the POST group). Patients in the POSTgroup were less likely to require re-excision (9% POST vs 37% PRE; p < 0.001) andwere less likely to undergo conversion to mastectomy (5% POST vs 14% PRE; p =0.02). After consensus guideline publication, mean operative cost per patientdecreased ($4,874 POST vs $5,772 PRE; p < 0.001), and patients had improvedbreast quality of life scores (77 out of 100 POST vs 61 out of 100 PRE; p =0.03). On multivariable analysis, publication of the consensus statement was anindependent predictor of decreased re-excision rates (odds ratio 0.17; 95% CI0.08 to 0.38; p < 0.001) and operative cost per patient (odds ratio 0.14; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.30; p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Widespread implementation of the consensus guideline on margins for breast conserving operation will likely lead to the intended improvements inoperative and financial outcomes, as well as patient satisfaction with breastconserving operation.Copyright © 2018 American College of Surgeons.
