Our study aims to investigate theanticancer effect of a simultaneous inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS) andCK2 in MCF-7 breast cancer and CCRF-CEM leukemia cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The type of interaction between CK2 inhibitors: CX-4945,4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (TBBi), or recently obtained4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-2-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)acetonitrile (2b) andTS-directed anticancer drug, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was determined using the MTTassay and a combination index method. The influence of the combined treatment on apoptosis in leukemia cells, as well as on cell-cycle progression and the levels of TS, CK2α and P-Ser529-p65 were determined in both cell lines, using flowcytometry and western blot analysis, respectively.RESULTS: The best synergistic effect was observed in CCRF-CEM cell line with the combination of 5-FU and 2b which correlated with a decrease in the endocellularCK2 activity and enhancement of the pro-apoptotic effect.CONCLUSION: The obtained results demonstrate the ability of CK2 inhibitors toenhance the efficacy of 5-FU in anticancer treatment, indicating a differentmolecular mechanism of the studied CK2 inhibitors interaction with 5-FU.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12766 PMID: 30061228  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
