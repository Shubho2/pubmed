ERα expression, toxicity and viability ofDIS-ZR751 were analyzed before and after treatment in vitro. DIS-ZR751-bearingnude mice were randomly divided into four groups according to differenttreatments: blank (DIS-ZR751), docetaxel (DIS-ZR751+DOC), fulvestrant(DIS-ZR751+FUL), and combination treatment (DIS-ZR751+DOC+FUL). 18F-FES and18F-FDG microPECT/CT scans were performed before and 7, 14 days after treatment. Absolute %ID/gmax was calculated.RESULTS: ERα expression level and growth rate of DIS-ZR751 were higher thancontrol group and decreased dramatically after docetaxel and fulvestrantcombination treatment. 18F-FES and 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in vivo revealed thatERα expression in DIS-ZR751 treated with fulvestrant, and tumor activity inDIS-ZR751 treated with combination drugs decreased as early as 7 days aftertreatment.CONCLUSIONS: 18F-FES and 18F-FDG PET/CT were feasible for early monitoring theeffect of fulvestrant on sensitizing docetaxel by downregulation of ERα in ERα+breast cancer noninvasively.DOI: 10.1007/s12149-018-1245-0 PMID: 29478216
