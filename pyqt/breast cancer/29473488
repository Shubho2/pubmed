Thus far, there have been no analytical reviews of research produced within this area.OBJECTIVES: We sought to analyse the nature andextent of empirical studies about breast cancer in Vietnam, identifying areas for future research andsystemsstrengthening.METHODS: We undertook a scoping study using a five-stage framework to reviewpublished and grey literature in English and Vietnamese on breast cancerdetection, diagnosis and treatment. We focused specifically on researchdiscussing the health system and service provision.RESULTS: Our results show that breast cancer screening is limited, with nopermanent or integrated national screening activities. There is a lack ofinformation on screening processes and on the integration of screening serviceswith other areas of the health system. Treatment is largely centralised, andacross all services there is a lack of evaluation and data collection that would be informative for recommendations seeking to improve accessibility and qualityof breast cancer services.CONCLUSIONS: This paper is the first scoping review of breast cancer services in Vietnam. It outlines areas for future focus for policy makers and researcherswith the objective of strengthening service provision to women with breast canceracross the country while also providing a methodological example for how toconduct a collaborative scoping review.DOI: 10.1080/16549716.2018.1435344 PMCID: PMC5827719PMID: 29473488
