Multivariable prediction models for CBC risk are needed and MDcould contribute to these.METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of MD and CBC risk in phase II of the WECARE study where cases had a CBC diagnosed ≥ 2 years after first diagnosis atage <55 years and controls had unilateral breast cancer (UBC) with similarfollow-up time. We retrieved film mammograms of the unaffected breast from twotime points, prior to/at the time of the first diagnosis (253 CBC cases, 269 UBC controls) and ≥ 6 months up to 48 months following the first diagnosis (333 CBCcases, 377 UBC controls). Mammograms were digitized and percent MD (%MD) wasmeasured using the thresholding program Cumulus. Odds ratios (OR) and 95%confidence intervals (CI) for association between %MD and CBC, adjusted for age, treatment, and other factors related to CBC, were estimated using logisticregression. Linear regression was used to estimate the association betweentreatment modality and change in %MD in 467 women with mammograms at both timepoints.RESULTS: For %MD assessed following diagnosis, there was a statisticallysignificant trend of increasing CBC with increasing %MD (p = 0.03). Lower density(<25%) was associated with reduced risk of CBC compared to 25 to < 50% density(OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49, 0.98). Similar, but weaker, associations were noted for%MD measurements prior to/at diagnosis. The relationship appeared strongest inwomen aged < 45 years and non-existent in women aged 50 to 54 years. A decreaseof ≥ 10% in %MD between first and second mammogram was associated marginally withreduced risk of CBC (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40, 1.01) compared to change of <10%. Bothtamoxifen and chemotherapy were associated with statistically significant 3%decreases in %MD (p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Post-diagnosis measures of %MD may be useful to include in CBC risk prediction models with consideration of age at diagnosis. Chemotherapy isassociated with reductions in %MD, similar to tamoxifen.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0948-4 PMCID: PMC5863854PMID: 29566728
