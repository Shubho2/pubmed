In this work, wepropose a layered pathway evolution method to compress a deep convolutionalneural network (DCNN) for classification of masses in digital breasttomosynthesis (DBT). The objective is to prune the number of tunable parameterswhile preserving the classification accuracy. In the first stage transferlearning, 19 632 augmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) from 2454 mass lesions onmammograms were used to train a pre-trained DCNN on ImageNet. In the second stagetransfer learning, the DCNN was used as a feature extractor followed by featureselection and random forest classification. The pathway evolution was performedusing genetic algorithm in an iterative approach with tournament selection drivenby count-preserving crossover and mutation. The second stage was trained with9120 DBT ROIs from 228 mass lesions using leave-one-case-out cross-validation.The DCNN was reduced by 87% in the number of neurons, 34% in the number ofparameters, and 95% in the number of multiply-and-add operations required in the convolutional layers. The test AUC on 89 mass lesions from 94 independent DBTcases before and after pruning were 0.88 and 0.90, respectively, and thedifference was not statistically significant (p  >  0.05). The proposed DCNNcompression approach can reduce the number of required operations by 95% whilemaintaining the classification performance. The approach can be extended to otherdeep neural networks and imaging tasks where transfer learning is appropriate.DOI: 10.1088/1361-6560/aabb5b PMCID: PMC5967610 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29616660
