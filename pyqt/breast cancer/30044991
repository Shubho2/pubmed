Analysis of geneexpression changes associated with the EMT program led to the identification ofan EMT-induced cell-surface protein, podocalyxin (PODXL), as a key mediator ofextravasation in mesenchymal breast and pancreatic carcinoma cells. PODXLpromotes extravasation through direct interaction of its intracellular domainwith the cytoskeletal linker protein ezrin. Ezrin proceeds to establish dorsalcortical polarity, enabling the transition of cancer cells from a non-polarized, rounded cell morphology to an invasive extravasation-competent shape. Hence, the EMT program can directly enhance the efficiency of extravasation and subsequentmetastasis formation through a PODXL-ezrin signaling axis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
