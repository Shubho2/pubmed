Preliminaryresults are reported.METHODS: Patients who received single-axillary-incision E-NSM from August 2013 toAugust 2017 were searched from a single institution. Data were analyzed todetermine the effectiveness and oncologic safety of single-axillary-incisionE-NSM. Patient-oriented cosmetic outcome report was also obtained.RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 50 E-NSM with single-incisionprocedures were performed in 41 female patients with breast cancer, including 11 (26.8%) patients with bilateral disease. Their mean age was 45.3 ± 8.4 years. Themean size of tumors encountered during the 50 single-incision E-NSM procedureswas 2.3 ± 1.8 (0.1-7.3) cm for invasive tumors and 2.6 ± 1.7 (0.2-5.7) cm forcarcinoma in situ lesions. Six (12%) of those tumors weremultifocal/multicentric. Lymph node metastasis was found during 12% of theprocedures. Forty-five (90%) received immediate breast reconstruction with gelimplant. Mean operating time was 244.3 ± 82.8 min. The overall complication rate was 6%, and no total nipple necrosis or implant loss was observed. Nolocoregional recurrence or distant metastasis was found during mean follow-up of 21.6 months. About 94.4% of patients were satisfied with the postoperative scarlocation and wound length. All patients who responded would choose the sameoperation again.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed single-axillary-incision endoscopic hybrid techniquefor nipple-sparing mastectomy was a safe procedure with low morbidity andassociated with high patient satisfaction.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6383-z PMID: 29484564
