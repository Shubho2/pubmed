However, the expression level, function and mechanism of ZKSCAN3 in breast cancer remains unknown. In the current study,immunohistochemistry, western blot and quantitative real time polymerase chainreaction (qRT-PCR) results showed that ZKSCAN3 was overexpressed in breast cancertissue compared with normal breast tissue. Through analyzing theclinicopathological characteristics, we demonstrated that positive ZKSCAN3expression predicted poor prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Theexpression level of ZKSCAN3 protein/mRNA in breast cancer cells (MCF-7 andMDA-MB-231) was higher than its expression in normal breast cells (HBL-100).Knocking down ZKSCAN3 via its short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion. Western blot analysis showedthat ZKSCAN3 silencing lead to significant decreases in the expression of Cyclin D1, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/MMP-9, aswell as increases in the expression of Bcl2 Associated X Protein (Bax) in breast cancer cells. Additionally, ZKSCAN3-shRNA expression markedly suppressed tumorgrowth in breast cancer xenograft mice. Finally, we demonstrated that silencingof ZKSCAN3 was able to inhibit Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by blocking p-Akt andp-mTOR protein expression in breast cancer cells. These results demonstrate that ZKSCAN3 plays a significant role in the progression of breast cancer. Therefore, ZKSCAN3 is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.07.019 PMID: 30049438
