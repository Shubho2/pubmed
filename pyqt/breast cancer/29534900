The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the risk ofbreast cancer (BC) in men with PC as their first cancer diagnosis was influenced by PRT.METHODS AND MATERIALS: From the Norwegian Cancer Registry, we collected data fromall patients with PC as their first cancer diagnosis from 1997 to 2014. Weregistered all RT given to the patients in the same period and the occurrence of BC diagnosed ≥3 months after the PC diagnosis. The histopathologic diagnoses ofall BC cases were collected. Subdistribution hazard ratios for the risk of BC in the PRT and non-PRT groups were estimated. A standardized incidence ratio for BC was calculated by comparing our cohort to the standard male population.RESULTS: We analyzed 59,169 patients with PC, of whom 7864 (13.3%) had receivedPRT. The median follow-up time was 4 years. Of the 12 men with a diagnosis of BC,3 had received PRT, and 2 of the 3 were phyllodes tumors. The risk of BC was not significantly different statistically for the patients given PRT compared withthe non-PRT group (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval0.41-5.62, adjusted for age and time of diagnosis). The standardized incidenceratio was 0.996 (95% confidence interval 0.57-1.75).CONCLUSIONS: In this registry-based study, we did not find an increased risk ofBC in PC patients who received PRT. The number of BC cases in our study was low, and the risk of secondary BC after PRT seems to be negligible. The incidence ofBC could, however, increase with additional follow-up. Also, 2 patients who hadreceived PRT developed a malignant phyllodes tumor, an extremely rare type of BC associated with gynecomastia.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
