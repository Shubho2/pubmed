Special attention is paid to (1)the association with educational attainment and (2) the country's cancerscreening strategy (organised, pilot/regional or opportunistic) for each type of cancer screened. Data were obtained from Eurobarometer 66.2 'Health in theEuropean Union' (2006). Final samples consisted of 10,186; 5443 and 9851individuals for cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer, respectively.Multinomial logistic regressions were performed. Surprisingly, even in countries with organised screening programmes, participation in screenings for cervical,breast and colorectal cancer was most likely to be initiated by the generalpractitioner (GP) or the participant. In general, GPs were found to play acrucial role in making referrals to screenings, regardless of the country'sscreening strategy. The results also revealed differences between educationalgroups with regard to their incentive to participate in cervical and breastcancer screening and, to a lesser extent, in colorectal cancer screening. People with high education are more likely to participate in cancer screening at theirown initiative, while people with less education are more likely to participateat the initiative of a physician or a screening programme. Albeit, the resultsvaried according to type of cancer screening and national screening strategy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.healthpol.2018.02.001 PMID: 29454541
