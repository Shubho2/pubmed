[Epubahead of print]Breast cancer mortality and screening mammography in New Zealand: Incidence-basedand aggregate analyses.Taylor R(1), Gregory M(2), Sexton K(2), Wharton J(1), Sharma N(1), Amoyal G(1),Morrell S(1).Author information: (1)1 School of Public Health and Community Medicine, University of NSW, Sydney,Australia.(2)2 BreastScreen Aotearoa, National Screening Unit, Ministry of Health,Wellington, New Zealand.Objective To investigate trends in breast cancer mortality in New Zealand women, to corroborate or negate a causal association with service screening mammography.Method Cumulated mortality rates from breast cancer deaths individually linked toincident cases diagnosed before and after screening commencement were compared,in women aged 50-64 (from 2001) and aged 45-49 and 65-69 (from 2006). Trends and differences in aggregate invasive breast cancer mortality (1975-2013) wereassessed in relation to introduction of mammography screening targeting womenaged 50-64 and 45-69. Joinpoint analysis was also undertaken. Results Thereduction in incidence-based cumulated breast cancer mortality before and afterthe introduction of screening was -15% (p = 0.006) for women aged 45-69, and 17% (p = 0.005) for those aged 50-64. Aggregate mortality declined by -34% (2005-13compared with 1992-98) in the age group 50-64, and by -28% among women aged 45-49and -25% among women aged 65-74. For women aged 50-64 the 2-joinpoint model showsa 1990 turning point, from prior rising mortality to a mean -1.8% decline perannum, coinciding with improvements in primary treatment of breast cancer; and a steepening of the decline (-3.0% p.a.) from the late 1990s, coinciding with theintroduction of service mammography screening. Conclusion Breast cancer mortalitydeclines occurring since the advent of screening mammography in New Zealand areconsistent with other incidence-based and aggregate studies of screeningmammography in populations, individual-based cohort studies, and randomizedcontrolled trials.DOI: 10.1177/0969141318776039 PMID: 29895225
