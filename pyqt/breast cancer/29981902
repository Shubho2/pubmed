A total of 24 halophilic eubacteriawere isolated and identified based on their biochemical and 16S rDNA sequences.Three major classes (Gamma-Proteobacteria, Alpha-Proteobacteria and Bacilli) ofbacteria were detected in the deep sea sediments of active volcanic BarrenIsland. Among those, 37% of isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity against alltested Gram positive and Gram negative clinical pathogens. 60% of isolatesrevealed the presence of either PKS or NRPS genes and 65% isolates disclosedmedium to higher level of cytotoxicity in MB-231 breast cancer cell line.Majority of the isolates revealed excellent potential for bioprospecting of novelbyproducts with industrial and pharmaceutical importance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
