Mammalian somatic cells display limitedproliferative properties in vitro that results in a process of permanent cellcycle arrest commonly known as senescence. Events leading to cellular senescence are complex but may be due to the increase in tumor suppressor genes, caused bylifetime somatic mutations. Cumulative mutation leaves an imprint on the genomeof the cell, an important risk factor for the occurrence of cancer. Adults overthe age of 65+ are vulnerable to age related diseases such as cancers but suchchanges may begin at middle age. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-codingRNA, can regulate cancer progression, recurrence and metastasis. This chapterdiscusses the role of miRNA in tumor microenvironment, consequent to aging.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-74470-4_9 PMID: 29754179
