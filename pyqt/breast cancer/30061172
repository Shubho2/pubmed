However, the intrinsicmolecular mechanism of LncRNAs acting on papillary thyroid carcinoma is not well understood. In this study, we found that PROX1-AS1 levels were obviouslyincreased in thyroid cancer cells compared with the normal thyroid epithelialcells. Knockdown of PROX1-AS1 gene expression by siRNA could inhibit cellproliferation. Subsequently, we also observed that silencing PROX1-AS1 mightinhibit invasion and migration of thyroid cancer cell lines via modulating theexpression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) related proteins. Inconclusion, our study indicated that LncRNA PROX1-AS1 could promote PTCdevelopment and might serve as a potential targeting marker for papillary thyroidcarcinoma.Â©2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20180862 PMID: 30061172
