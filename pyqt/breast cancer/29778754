Electronic address: jhtang@njmu.edu.cn.The subtypes of distant-organ metastasis led to treatment failure and poorprognosis are major obstacles in the management of patients with advanced breast cancer (BCa). Emerging evidences demonstrated that exosomes act as mediators for intercellular communication between various types of cells in the local tumormicroenvironment. The present study aims to investigate whether BCa-derivedexosomes are capable of cell-cell transferring miR-222 for BCa metastaticprogression. Results showed that exosomal miR-222 is highly expressed in BCapatients with lymphatic metastasis. Consistently, the elevated levels of exosomalmiR-222 are closely correlated with the high aggressivity of BCa cell lines.miR-222 promoting the aggressivity of BCa cells was confirmed in vitro and invivo. Mechanistically, miR-222 directly targets PDLIM2, a tumor suppressor gene, leading to activation of NF-κB signal pathway. In conclusion, the levels ofexosomal miR-222 are correlated with BCa metastatic progression.Exosome-transferred miR-222 promotes migration and invasion of BCa cells. miR-222contributes to tumorigenicity of BCa cells through down-regulation of PDLIM2 and consequently activating NF-κB.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
