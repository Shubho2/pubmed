It is necessary todesign and test the psychological interventions that can improve post-traumaticgrowth. The objective of this study was to determine the effect ofcognitive-emotional training on post-traumatic growth in women with breast cancerreferred to the department of chemotherapy. This is a quasi-experimental studyand it was performed on 85 patients with breast cancer who referred to aneducational hospital in southeastern of Iran in 2017. The eligible patients were selected through convenience method sampling among the patients and they randomlyallocated into intervention and control groups. The intervention group receivedfive sessions of emotional-cognitive training in two sessions per week. Eachsession lasted 60-90 min. The posttest data were collected by post-traumaticgrowth inventory (PTGI) 20 weeks after the end of the last intervention session. Collected data were analyzed by SPSS software version 21.00 using independent ttest, paired t test, and Chi-square tests for demographic analysis. The resultsindicated that there is no significant difference in both groups in terms ofindividual variables such as age, marriage, duration of disease, and degreeprogression of cancer. Although the mean of PTG scores in posttest and the meanof variations in the PTG scores in the intervention group were 77.48 ± 11.18 and 25.81 ± 12.24, respectively, and it was significantly higher than the controlgroup, 53.95 ± 14.86 and 7.69 ± 9, respectively (mean scores of PTG: p < .0001;mean changes of PTG: p < .001). According to the results of this study,cognitive-behavioral intervention had a positive and significant effect onpost-traumatic growth in women with breast cancer. If intervention is found to beeffective, cognitive and emotional strategies of such interventions could beintegrated into daily clinical practice as a way to promote PTG in women who are being treated for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10880-018-9561-z PMID: 29572619
