The tumor located atleft side in 9 cases and right side in 16 cases; 14 cases were in the left upper quadrant, 4 cases were in the left lower quadrant, 7 cases were on the top of thebreast. All cases were invasive ductal carcinoma. According to TNM staging, 14cases were at stageⅠand 11 cases were at stageⅡA. The diameter of lumps were all less than 3 cm. All those lumps were solitary and without distant metastasis. Thesentinel nodes were all negative. After modified radical mastectomy, the breasts were reconstructed by serratus anterior muscle flap and breast implants. Thenipples were spared in 22 cases.Results: The operation time was 113-148 minutes (mean, 136 minutes). All breasts survived and incisions healed at stageⅠ. There was no complication such ashematoma, infection, etc. All patients were followed up 6-18 months (mean, 15months). Except 1 case, the others were evaluated according to the criteria ofthe reconstructed breast at 12 months after operation. Among them, 23 cases were evaluated as good and 1 case as fair. There was no tumor recurrence during thefollow-up period.Conclusion: The combination of serratus anterior muscle flap and breast implants after the modified radical mastectomy is a handy approach of breastreconstruction which is less harmful with few postoperative complications. Italso gains a high degree of satisfaction from patients for good breast shape.Publisher: 探讨前锯肌肌瓣联合假体植入在乳腺癌改良根治术后即刻乳房再造中的应用。.2015 年 1 月— 12月收治 25 例乳腺癌女性患者，年龄24～62 岁，平均 40.6 岁。左侧 9 例，右侧 16 例。均为浸润性导管癌。TNM 分期：Ⅰ期 14 例，ⅡA 期 11 例。肿瘤位于乳房外上象限 14 例，上方 7 例，外下象限 4 例；均为单发肿块，肿块直径均<3 cm；无远处转移。前哨淋巴结均为阴性。改良根治术后，采用前锯肌肌瓣联合假体植入即刻再造乳房，其中22 例保留乳头乳晕。.手术时间 113～148 min，平均 136 min。术后再造乳房均全部成活，切口均 Ⅰ期愈合，无血肿、感染等并发症发生。患者均获随访，随访时间 6～18 个月，平均 15 个月。除 1 例未随访达 12 个月外，其余患者术后 12个月时参照再造乳房评价标准，获良 23 例、中 1例。随访期间无肿瘤复发。.乳腺癌改良根治术后采用前锯肌肌瓣联合假体植入即刻乳房再造，操作简便、损伤小、术后并发症少、再造乳房形态良好，患者满意度高。.DOI: 10.7507/1002-1892.201704032 PMID: 29798568  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
