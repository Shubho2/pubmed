This study reports a case of a woman treated for HL at the age of 24 years, who developed breast cancer after an interval of 20 years. This casehighlights once again the importance of awareness among HL survivors about their increased breast cancer risk and re-launches the debate about the efficacy ofadoption of breast screening guidelines.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.810 PMCID: PMC5828673PMID: 29492104
