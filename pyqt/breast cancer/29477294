The purpose of this study was to use localizedmicrobubble delivery to overcome hypoxia prior to therapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, surfactant-shelled oxygen microbubbles werefabricated and injected intravenously to locally elevate tumor oxygen levels whentriggered by noninvasive ultrasound in mice with human breast cancer tumors.Changes in oxygen and sensitivity to radiation therapy were then measured.RESULTS: In this work, we show that oxygen-filled microbubbles successfully andconsistently increase breast tumor oxygenation levels in a murine model by20 mmHg, significantly more than control injections of saline solution oruntriggered oxygen microbubbles (P < .001). Using photoacoustic imaging, we also show that oxygen delivery is independent of hemoglobin transport, enabling oxygendelivery to avascular regions of the tumor. Finally, we show that overcominghypoxia by this method immediately prior to radiation therapy nearly triplesradiosensitivity. This improvement in radiosensitivity results in roughly 30 daysof improved tumor control, providing statistically significant improvements intumor growth and animal survival (P < .03).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the potential advantages ofultrasound-triggered oxygen delivery to solid tumors and warrant future effortsinto clinical translation of the microbubble platform.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
