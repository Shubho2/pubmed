In addition to early detection of lung cancer, lung cancer screening (LCS) provides an opportunity to detectcardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease), and extrapulmonary neoplasms, such asthyroid, breast, kidney, liver, esophageal, pancreatic and mediastinal tumors.Considering the fact that 22.3% of the certified deaths in the computedtomography (CT) arm of the NLST trial were due to extrapulmonary malignancies,compared to 22.9% of deaths from lung cancer, it is possible that early diagnosisand treatment of clinically significant incidental findings may further decrease morbidity and mortality in screening participants. In this article we reviewprevalence, clinical relevance and management of incidentally detectedextrapulmonary malignancies.DOI: 10.21037/tlcr.2018.06.05 PMCID: PMC6037975PMID: 30050774
