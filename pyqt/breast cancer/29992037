About four in ten women treated experiencefatigue, which can last for years after treatment. The impact of thisdebilitating tiredness is loss of independence and impaired physical and mentalfunction. Our study will take a behavioural intervention with demonstrated effectin treating fatigue in a mixed group of chemotherapy patients and adapt it forwomen undergoing radiotherapy for early breast cancer. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the feasibility of delivering the intervention in the radiotherapypathway for patients at a high risk of fatigue and to explore participants'experiences of the trial and intervention.Methods: A pragmatic single-site non-blinded feasibility trial of a behaviouralintervention. Main inclusion criteria are prescription of the UK standard 40 Gyin 15 fractions over 3 weeks of radiotherapy (± tumour bed boost) for early(stage 0-IIIa) breast cancer. The total projected sample size after attrition is 70. A previously developed fatigue risk score tool will be used to predictindividual's likelihood of experiencing fatigue. Thirty women predicted to be at a high risk of experiencing significant fatigue will be allocated in the ratio2:1 to the behavioural intervention or education trial arms, respectively. These feasibility trial participants will be assessed at baseline, after 10 and 15fractions of radiotherapy and 10 days, 3 weeks and 6 months after radiotherapy. Afurther 40 women predicted to be at a lower risk of fatigue will join a riskscore validation group.Measures to assess feasibility include recruitment,retention and completion rates and variation in implementation of theintervention. Process evaluation with intervention providers and users includesfidelity and adherence checks and qualitative interviews to understand howchanges in behaviour are initiated and sustained.Discussion: This feasibility study collates data to both inform the progressionto and design of a future definitive trial and to refine the intervention.Trial registration: ISRCTN 10303368.
