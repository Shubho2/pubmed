However, circulating DNA is not restricted to pregnant women,with increased levels of plasma DNA also frequently detected in the plasma ofcancer patients. Among pregnant women whose NIPT results were inconsistent withthe fetal karyotype, a small number of patients have subsequently been diagnosed with a previously undetected malignancy. However, the extent to which circulatingtumor DNA (ctDNA) affects the results of NIPT is still unclear. We examined serumfrom 50 nonpregnant women with breast tumors by NIPT. These samples were thenadded to serum containing trisomy 13, 18, and 21 fetal DNA to figure out theextent to which maternal tumors can interrupt NIPT results in pregnant women withbreast tumors. Concentrations of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were higher in bothpregnant women and breast tumor patients, relative to nonpregnant healthycontrols. Among the 50 samples evaluated, 3 produced false positive NIPT results for trisomy 13, 18, or 21, indicating that genomic copy number variations (CNVs) had occurred. Simulation testing also showed that ctDNA can increase the standarddeviation of the associated z-scores, which lower absolute z-scores by decreasingthe proportion of circulating fetal DNA relative to total DNA. Of the 50 samples tested, 9 fell within the equivocal range and 8 produced false negative resultsfor trisomy 13, 18, or 21. Data presented here show for the first time that ctDNAis able to affect NIPT results in two ways. First, ctDNA can lead to falsepositive results due to the detection of genomic CNVs in tumor DNA.Alternatively, ctDNA can increase the likelihood of a false negative bydecreasing the proportion of circulating fetal DNA in serum.DOI: 10.1089/dna.2017.4112 PMID: 29957029  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
