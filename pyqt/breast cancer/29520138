The aim of this study was to furtherassess the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and anti-tumor efficacy of LHRHreceptor-targeted liposomes loaded with the anticancer drug mitoxantrone (MTO).Methods: Plasma and tissue distribution profiles of LHRH receptor-targetedMTO-loaded liposomes (LHRH-MTO-LIPs) were quantified in healthy mice or axenograft tumor nude mouse model of MCF-7 breast cancer, and were compared withnon-targeted liposomes and a free-drug solution.Results: The LHRH-MTO-LIPs demonstrated a superior pharmacokinetic profilerelative to free MTO. The first target site of accumulation is the kidney,followed by the liver, and then the tumor; maximal tumor accumulation occurs at 4h post-administration. Moreover, the LHRH-MTO-LIPs exhibited enhanced inhibition of MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth in vivo compared with non-targeted MTO-loaded liposomes (MTO-LIPs) and free MTO.Conclusion: The novel LHRH receptor-targeted liposome may become a viableplatform for the future targeted treatment of cancer.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S150512 PMCID: PMC5833774PMID: 29520138  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
