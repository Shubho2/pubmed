Children'sunderstanding of maternal breast cancer and its treatment was relativelyrealistic, although sometimes inaccurate.CONCLUSIONS: Individual evaluation and appropriate explanation is significant to further children's understanding of their mother's illness. Future studies withlarger sample size are needed to explore the understanding for children ofdifferent ages, in order to provide specific help for these children.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
