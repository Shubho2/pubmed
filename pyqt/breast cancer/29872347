The purpose of this study were to quantify thelifetime risks, life expectancies (LEs) after diagnosis, expected years of lifelost (EYLL), and lifetime health care expenditures for 19 major cancers inTaiwan.Methods: A total of 831,314 patients with 19 pathologically proven cancers wereabstracted from the Taiwan Cancer Registry from 1998 to 2012. They were linked tothe National Mortality Registry (1998-2014) and National Health Insurancereimbursement database (1998-2013) for survival and health care costs. Weestimated the cumulative incidence rate for ages 0-79 years and the lifetimesurvival function for patients with different cancer sites. The EYLL wascalculated by subtracting the LE of each cancer cohort from that of the age- and sex-matched referents simulated from national life tables. The estimated lifetimecost was calculated by adding up the product of survival probability and meancost at the corresponding duration-to-date after adjustment for the inflation to the year of 2013.Results: There were 5 cancers with a lifetime risk exceeding 4%: colorectal,liver, lung, and prostate in males, and breast and colorectal in females. Cancerswith EYLL of >10 years were: esophageal, intrahepatic bile ducts, liver,pancreas, oral, nasopharyngeal, leukemia, lung, and gallbladder, extrahepaticbile ducts and biliary tract in males, and intrahepatic bile ducts, pancreas,nasopharyngeal, lung, esophageal, leukemia, liver, gallbladder, extrahepatic bileducts and biliary tract, ovary, and stomach in females. Cancers with lifetimehealth care expenditures exceeding US$50,000 to the National Health Insurancewere as follows: leukemia, kidney, testis, renal pelvis and ureter in males, and renal pelvis and ureter, leukemia, breast, urinary bladder, kidney, ovary, andnasopharyngeal in females. All these impacts should be considered in healthpolicy decisions.Conclusion: The impacts of cancer in Taiwan are very large. Future studies mustconsider both quality of life and the entire impact from societal perspectives.DOI: 10.2147/CLEP.S155601 PMCID: PMC5973634PMID: 29872347
