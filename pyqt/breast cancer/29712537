However, little is known in terms of the underlyingmolecular mechanisms that would affect the initiation and progression of breastcancer. In the present study, we use two murine mammary tumor models withdifferent speeds of tumor initiation and progression for whole genome expression profiling to reveal the involved genes and signaling pathways. The pathwaysregulating PI3K-Akt signaling and Ras signaling were activated in Fvb mice andpromoted tumor progression. Contrastingly, the pathways regulating apoptosis and cellular senescence were activated in Fvb.B6 mice and suppressed tumorprogression. We identified distinct patterns of oncogenic pathways activation at different stages of breast cancer, and uncovered five oncogenic pathways thatwere activated in both human and mouse breast cancers. The genes and pathwaysdiscovered in our study would be useful information for other researchers anddrug development.DOI: 10.1080/15384101.2018.1442629 PMID: 29712537
