Here, we use a Small Molecule Microarray (SMM)profiling approach to identify the preferential interaction betweenchlorhexidine, a widely used oral antiseptic, and the G-quadruplex (G4) structurein the KRAS oncogene promoter. The interaction of chlorhexidine and related drugsto the KRAS G4 is evaluated using multiple biophysical methods, including thermalmelt, fluorescence titration and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays.Chlorhexidine has a specific low micromolar binding interaction with the G4,while related drugs have weaker and/or less specific interactions. Through NMRexperiments and docking studies, we propose a plausible binding mode driven byboth aromatic stacking and groove binding interactions. Additionally, cancer celllines harbouring oncogenic mutations in the KRAS gene exhibit increasedsensitivity to chlorhexidine. Treatment of breast cancer cells with chlorhexidinedecreases KRAS protein levels, while a KRAS gene transiently expressed by apromoter lacking a G4 is not affected. This work confirms that known ligands bindbroadly to G4 structures, while other drugs and druglike compounds can have more selective interactions that may be biologically relevant.DOI: 10.1093/nar/gky084 PMCID: PMC5888870PMID: 29481610
