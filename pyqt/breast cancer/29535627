Jab1/COPS5dysregulation contributes to oncogenesis by deactivating several tumorsuppressors and activating oncogenes. Jab1 overexpression was found in many tumortypes, illuminating its important role in cancer initiation, progression, andprognosis. Jab1/COPS5 has spurred a strong research interest in developinginhibitors of oncogenes/oncoproteins for cancer therapy. In this paper, wepresent evidences demonstrating the importance of Jab1/COPS5 overexpression inseveral cancer types and recent advances in dissecting the Jab1/COPS5 upstreamand downstream signaling pathways. By conducting ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA)based on the Ingenuity Knowledge Base, we investigated signaling network thatinteracts with Jab1/COPS5. The data confirmed the important role of Jab1/COPS5 intumorigenesis, demonstrating the potential of Jab1/COPS5 to be used as abiomarker for cancer patients, and further support that Jab1/COPS5 may serve as apotential therapeutic target in different cancers.DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00135 PMCID: PMC5835092PMID: 29535627
