While PARP inhibitors have been recently approved for treatment ofBRCA-mutant breast and ovarian cancers, not all patients respond to this therapy,and resistance to these novel drugs remains a major clinical problem. Severalmechanisms of chemoresistance in BRCA2-deficient cells have been identified.Rather than restoring normal recombination, these mechanisms result instabilization of stalled replication forks, which can be subjected to degradationin BRCA2-mutated cells. Here, we show that the transcriptional repressor E2F7modulates the chemosensitivity of BRCA2-deficient cells. We found thatBRCA2-deficient cells are less sensitive to PARP inhibitor and cisplatintreatment after E2F7 depletion. Moreover, we show that the mechanism underlyingthis activity involves increased expression of RAD51, a target for E2F7-mediated transcriptional repression, which enhances both HR DNA repair, and replicationfork stability in BRCA2-deficient cells. Our work describes a new mechanism oftherapy resistance in BRCA2-deficient cells, and identifies E2F7 as a putativebiomarker for tumor response to PARP inhibitor therapy.DOI: 10.1093/nar/gky657 PMID: 30032296
