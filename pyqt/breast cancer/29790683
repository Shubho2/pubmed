Autologous free dermal fatgraft (FDFG) is an emerging oncoplastic technique to improve the cosmetic outcomeof breast-conserving surgery.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze our experience with FDFGs inbreast reconstruction after breast-conserving surgery. Oncological outcomes,surgical complications and cosmetic results were considered.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective chart review study considered allconsecutive oncoplastic breast treatment by means of FDFG reconstruction duringthe period between September 2011 and September 2012 in our Clinic of Surgery(University of Udine, Italy). The data collected included patient and tumorcharacteristics and outcomes (cosmetic and oncological).RESULTS: During the study period, 37 women were treated by breast cancer surgery and immediate breast reconstruction by FDFG. At a 3-year follow-up, we found nocases of recurrence among breast cancer patients treated by FDFG; at a 18-monthfollow-up, we found a prevalence of 75.0% of women extremely satisfied with theironcoplastic surgery and a high prevalence of excellent or good cosmetic outcomes (70.3%) according to objective and subjective cosmetic assessment.CONCLUSIONS: Immediate breast reconstruction by FDFG after BCS in a populationselected for a low risk of breast cancer recurrence seems to be an oncologically safe option, with a good cosmetic outcome and a high prevalence of womensatisfied with the treatment.DOI: 10.17219/acem/68977 PMID: 29790683
