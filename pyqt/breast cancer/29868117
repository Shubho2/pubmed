Blokhin National Medical Research Center of Oncology, Moscow, Russia.(3)Institute of General Pathology and Pathophysiology, Moscow, Russia.Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands is generally recognized epigeneticmechanism responsible for gene silencing in cancer. However, molecular details onhow this epigenetic mark triggers the process of gene downregulation are stillelusive. Here, we used deep bisulfite sequencing and qPCR analysis to investigatethe pattern of CpG methylation of ALDH1L1 promoter region and its associationwith the gene expression level in 16 paired breast cancer (BC) samples ofdifferent clinical stages. Expression of ALDH1L1 gene was suppressed in allexamined BC samples up to 200-fold, and average hypermethylation level of thepromoter region correlated positively with ALDH1L1 downregulation. We determined the role of every individual CpG site within the ALDH1L1 promoter, includingupstream untranscribed region, first untranslated exon, and the start of thefirst intron, in aberrant gene expression by correlation analysis. The searchrevealed CpG sites which methylation has the highest impact on intensity of gene transcription. The majority of such CpG sites are located in a compact region in the first intron of the ALDH1L1 gene. These results assist in unraveling ofdynamic nature of CpG promoter hypermethylation as well as demonstrate theefficiency of deep bisulfite sequencing in search for novel epigenetic markers incancer.DOI: 10.3389/fgene.2018.00169 PMCID: PMC5962711PMID: 29868117
