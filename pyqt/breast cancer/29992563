We examined the association between weight change duringadulthood and the risk of obesity-related cancer among Japanese by conducting apooled analysis of two prospective studies of residents in Miyagi Prefecture,Japan. A total of 78,743 persons (40,422 women and 38,321 men) aged 40-79 yearsparticipated in the Miyagi Cohort Study in 1990 and in the Ohsaki Cohort Study in1994. Weight change since age 20 was divided into four categories (weight loss;stable weight; moderate weight gain; high weight gain). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and95% confidence intervals (CIs) for obesity-related cancer incidence. During1,057,899 person-years of follow up, 4,467 cases of obesity-related cancer(women; 1,916 cases, men; 2,551cases) were identified. In women, compared withthe stable weight, weight gain was associated with an increased risk ofobesity-related cancer (moderate weight gain; HRs = 1.10, 95%CIs: 0.97-1.26, highweight gain; HRs = 1.29, 95%CIs: 1.14-1.47). The results indicate that weightgain since age 20 was associated with a significantly increased risk ofobesity-related cancer among Japanese women. By contrast, in men, our study foundthat weight change is not associated with the incidence of obesity-relatedcancer. This article is protected by copyright.
