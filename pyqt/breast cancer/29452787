Our aim was to evaluate thequantitative benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of lowering the starting ageof breast cancer screening in the Dutch general population.METHODS: Economic modelling with a lifelong perspective compared biennialscreening for women aged 48-74years and for women aged 46-74years with thecurrent Dutch screening programme, which screen women between the ages of 50 and 74years. Tumour deaths prevented, years of life saved (YOLS), false-positiverates, radiation-induced tumours, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios(ICERs) were evaluated.RESULTS: Starting the screening at 48 instead of 50 years of age led to increasesin: the number of small tumours detected (4.0%), tumour deaths prevented (5.6%), false positives (9.2%), YOLS (5.6%), radiation-induced tumours (14.7%), and costs(4.1%). Starting the screening at 46 instead of 48 years of age increased thenumber of small tumours detected (3.3%), tumour deaths prevented (4.2%), falsepositives (8.8%), YOLS (3.7%), radiation-induced tumours (15.2%), and costs(4.0%). The ICER was €5600/YOLS for the 48-74 scenario and €5600/YOLS for the46-74 scenario.CONCLUSIONS: Women could benefit from lowering the starting age of screening asmore breast cancer deaths would be averted. Starting regular breast cancerscreening earlier is also cost-effective. As the number of additional expectedharms is relatively small in both the scenarios examined, and the difference inICERs is not large, introducing two additional screening rounds is justifiable.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
