However, the identification of reliable predictive biomarkers of pCR to NAC in TNBC patientsremains an urgent and largely unattended medical issue. In the present study, we evaluated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pCR and non-pCRpatients after doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide therapy, followed by paclitaxelpre-operative treatment in 64 TNBC patients recorded in the GSE41998 dataset ofGene Expression Omnibus and identified 118 DEGs. Subsequently, we selected fivecore genes that were closely associated with the pCR of TNBC patients by using a genetic algorithm‑support vector machine-based method. Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) was one of the five core genes and patients who achieved pCR expressed higher levels ofSIRT5. Thus, we speculated that SIRT5 may be a potential predictive marker of theresponse to anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy. Oncomine analysis revealedthat the expression levels of SIRT5 were higher inepirubicin/cyclophosphamide-docetaxel responders compared with non-responders.Furthermore, Gene Ontology analysis indicated that SIRT5 may affect the response to anthracycline-taxane-based chemotherapy by regulating the Rho pathway. It was also observed that SIRT5 was upregulated in TNBC and breast cancer with BRCA1mutation subtypes. High SIRT5 expression was also associated with poor clinicaloutcomes of breast cancer patients. In conclusion, the present study revealedSIRT5 as a biomarker for response to anthracycline-taxane-based NAC in patientswith TNBC and identified a series of novel biological functions of SIRT5 inbreast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6319 PMID: 29565454
