China.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate mammalian cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis by altering the expression of other genes, and serve multiple roles intumorigenesis and progression. miR-106a has been implicated in several types ofmalignancies. However, its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unknown. Thepresent study reported that in this particular cancer, miR-106a exhibits a tumor suppressive role. It was demonstrated that the high expression of miR-106a in CRCcells is negatively associated with E2F transcription factor 1 protein level and positively associated with caspase activation, suggesting a potential molecularswitch.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8516 PMCID: PMC5958685PMID: 29805629
