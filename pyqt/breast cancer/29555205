Electronic address: peter.vangheluwe@kuleuven.be.The Secretory Pathway Ca2+ ATPases SPCA1 and SPCA2 transport Ca2+ and Mn2+ intothe Golgi and Secretory Pathway. SPCA2 mediates store-independent Ca2+ entry(SICE) via STIM1-independent activation of Orai1, inducing constitutive Ca2+influx in mammary epithelial cells during lactation. Here, we show that likeSPCA2, also the overexpression of the ubiquitous SPCA1 induces cytosolic Ca2+influx, which is abolished by Orai1 knockdown and occurs independently of STIM1. This process elevates the Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol and in thenon-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, pointing to a functional coupling between Orai1 and SPCA1. In agreement with this, we demonstrate via Total InternalReflection Fluorescence microscopy that Orai1 and SPCA1a co-localize near theplasma membrane. Interestingly, SPCA1 overexpression also induces Golgi swelling,which coincides with translocation of the transcription factor TFE3 to thenucleus, a marker of Golgi stress. The induction of Golgi stress depends on acombination of SPCA1 activity and SICE, suggesting a role for the increased Ca2+ level in the non-ER stores. Finally, we tested whether impaired SPCA1a/Orai1coupling may be implicated in the skin disorder Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD),which is caused by SPCA1 loss-of-function. We identified HHD-associated SPCA1amutations that impair either the Ca2+ transport function, Orai1 activation, orboth, while all mutations affect the Ca2+ content of the non-ER stores. Thus, thefunctional coupling between SPCA1 and Orai1 increases cytosolic and intraluminal Ca2+ levels, representing a novel mechanism of SICE that may be affected in HHD.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
