After an asymptomatic period ofone month to several years, the symptoms (circumscribed inflammation, edema,sclerosis) often arise suddenly and cannot be clinically distinguished froma local recurrence in the form of inflammatory carcinoma.CASE: We present a case of a 74-year-old woman who developed this rare andserious local side-effect in connective tissue following neoadjuvant CDK 4/6inhibitor abemaciclib (Verzenio®) and aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (Arimidex®)therapy and subsequent radiation therapy of the breast.CONCLUSIONS: Little is known about risk factors and pathogenesis of RIM. Here we describe the first case of RIM following immunotherapy. The diagnosis is based onclinical appearance and histopathological examination. Treatment should beinitiated in the inflammatory stage in order to prevent or delay irreversiblefibrosis and atrophy of the breast.DOI: 10.1007/s00066-018-1336-9 PMID: 30014236
