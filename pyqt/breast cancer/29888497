We conducted hot spot analyses of the rate of late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer at the census tract level in Nebraska for casesdiagnosed between 2008 and 2012, using cancer registry data. We also conductedhot spot analyses of access to mammography facilities (distance to the nearestcenter) using data on mammography facilities from the US Food and DrugAdministration and rates of screening using the National Private Insurance Claimsdata for year 2013.RESULTS: The spatial clustering analyses found that urban areas in Nebraska hadlower distances to mammography centers, higher screening rates and lower rates oflate-stage diagnosis of breast cancer. Rural areas had higher distance to themammography centers and higher rates of late-stage at diagnosis for breastcancer.CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from this study points to geographic disparities inaccess to screening for breast cancer. Mitigating the access issues that ruralwomen face would require interventions specifically targeted to ruralpopulations.Â© 2018 National Rural Health Association.DOI: 10.1111/jrh.12308 PMID: 29888497
