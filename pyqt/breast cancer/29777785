Electronic address: rengs726@126.com.Alterations in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and UPS-associated proteins have been implicated in the development of many human malignancies. In thisstudy, we investigated the expression profiles of 797 UPS-related genes usingHiSeq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and identified that PSMD2 was markedlyupregulated in breast cancer. High PSMD2 expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that transcriptomesignatures involving proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were criticallyenriched in specimens with elevated PSMD2. Consistently, PSMD2 knockdowninhibited cell proliferation and arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase in vitro, as well as suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Rescue assays demonstrated that the cellcycle arrest caused by silencing PSMD2 partially resulted from increased p21and/or p27. Mechanically, PSMD2 physically interacted with p21 and p27 andmediated their ubiquitin-proteasome degradation with the cooperation of USP14.Notably, intratumor injection of therapeutic PSMD2 small interfering RNAeffectively delayed xenograft tumor growth accompanied by p21 and p27upregulation. These data provide novel insight into the role of PSMD2 in breastcancer and suggest that PSMD2 may be a potential therapeutic target.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
