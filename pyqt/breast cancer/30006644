Exclusion criteria were as follows: history ofneoadjuvant therapy, history of pre-operative mammotome, insufficientpathologic/radiologic size report, clustered tumor, positive tumor resectionmargin, 18F-FDG non-avid tumor. The PHL was examined by two nuclear medicinephysicians. Tumor sizes (longest diameters) on 18F-FDG PET/CT were estimatedusing margins defined as the inner line of the PHL. Pathologic tumor sizes wereutilized as reference standards.RESULTS: The PHL of each tumor was most commonly designated as the 20%-30% bandof the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) it exhibited an inversecorrelation with tumor SUVmax. Tumor size on 18F-FDG PET/CT showed a more linear correlation with pathology than that on MRI (r2=0.91 vs 0.65). In Bland-Altmananalysis, 18F-FDG PET/CT showed significantly lower bias in size differencerelative to pathology, compared with MRI (0.6±9.6cm vs. -1.9±17.3cm).Fluorine-18-FDG PET/CT showed more accurate T staging with pathology, especially in T3 cases, than MRI.CONCLUSION: A method of tumor size determination, using PHL on 18F-FDG PET/CT,showed more linear relationship and smaller size differences with pathology than MRI (average 0.6 vs. 1.9cm). It provides sufficient reliability andreproducibility for measuring tumor size in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1967/s002449910802 PMID: 30006644
