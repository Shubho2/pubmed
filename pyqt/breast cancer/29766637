The clinical significance of tumor-expressed F5 wasevaluated in breast cancer patient cohorts. F5 was expressed in human breasttumors, and the expression was higher than in normal tissue. High F5 expressionwas associated with aggressive tumors, but also with survival in breastcancer.SUMMARY: Background Tumor expression of certain coagulation factors hasbeen linked to cancer progression. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in F5(encoding the FV protein) have been found to be associated with breast cancer;however, the role of coagulation factor V (FV) in cancer pathogenesis remainsundiscovered. Objectives We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of FV and the regulatory role of F5 gene variants in breast cancer. Patients/Methods A Scandinavian 503-sample breast cancer cohort and three public breast cancerdatasets (GOBO, TCGA and KM plotter) were used to determine associations between F5 gene expression (tumor-specific), circulating FV, F5 SNPs, clinicalcharacteristics and breast cancer survival. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was usedto detect FV antigen in tumors. Results F5 expression was 2-fold higher in breasttumors compared with normal tissue, and the presence of FV antigen in breasttumors was confirmed by IHC staining. F5 expression was increased in patientswith hormone receptor negative tumors, triple negative tumors, HER2-enriched and basal-like tumors. In patients with basal tumors, high expression of F5 wasassociated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio, HR = 0.52, 95%confidence interval, 0.31-0.86). SNPs in F5 were associated with tumor size andluminal A tumors. The rs6427202-rs9332542 C-G haplotype, previously associatedwith breast cancer, displayed a cis-regulatory effect on F5 expression in tumors and plasma FV antigen levels. In silico mining supported this regulatoryfunction. Conclusions FV was a possible marker of aggressive breast cancer, yetalso a predictor of favorable outcome. Evaluation of FV expression may beclinically useful for prognosis and treatment decisions in aggressive breastcancer.© 2018 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.DOI: 10.1111/jth.14151 PMID: 29766637
