Preoperative radiation delivery to the intact tumor enables bettertarget visualization and treatment volume reduction. Single dose preoperativeAPBI has the potential to improve toxicity profiles, reduce treatment burden and enable in vivo exploration of breast cancer radiogenomics.Purpose: Develop practical guidelines for single dose external beam preoperative APBI.Methods: Recommended dose constraints were derived from pooled dosimetryestimates from 2 clinical trials. In an American dose escalation trial, a uniform15, 18 or 21 Gy dose has previously been evaluated for non-lobular cT1N0 orlow/intermediate grade DCIS <2 cm in prone position (n = 32). In the Netherlands,the feasibility of ablative APBI (20 Gy to GTV, 15 Gy to CTV) to non-lobularcT1N0 in supine position, is currently being explored (n = 15). The dosimetricadherence to the developed constraints was evaluated in new APBI plans with a21 Gy uniform dose but an extended CTV margin (n = 32).Results: Dosimetric data pooling enabled the development of practical guidelines for single dose preoperative APBI.Conclusion: The developed guidelines will allow further explorations in thepromising field of single dose preoperative external beam APBI for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1016/j.ctro.2017.06.003 PMCID: PMC5862640PMID: 29594217
