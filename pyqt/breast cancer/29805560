China.Death associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a notable serine/threonine kinaseinvolved in the regulation of multiple cellular pathways, including apoptosis andautophagy. Although DAPK1 is usually considered to be a tumor suppressor, it was previously reported to promote the viability of p53 mutant cancer cell lines and possess physiological oncogenic functions in breast cancer. However, the ability of endogenous DAPK1 to suppress breast cancer cell mobility has not beenassessed. In the present study, the prognostic function of DAPK1 in a Chinesepatient cohort was evaluated, and no significant association was observed betweenDAPK1 expression and patient survival or lymph node metastasis. In order toinvestigate the physiological function of endogenous DAPK1, stable inducibleDAPK1 knockdown MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were established. Consistent with previous studies, endogenous DAPK1 only regulated cell viability in p53 mutantMDA-MB-231 cells. However, knockdown of DAPK1 did not significantly affect cellmotility of either MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells. Altogether, these results furtherexplored the function of endogenous DAPK1 in breast cancer and may shed light in understanding the molecular signaling pathways regulating the physiologicalfunction of DAPK1.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8439 PMCID: PMC5958705PMID: 29805560
