[Epub ahead of print]Risk and Prognosis of Cancer After Lower Limb Arterial Thrombosis.Sundbøll J(1), Veres K(2), Horváth-Puhó E(2), Adelborg K(2), Sørensen HT(2).Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus,Denmark jens.sundboll@clin.au.dk.(2)Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus,Denmark.Background -Venous thromboembolism can be a presenting symptom of cancer, but theassociation between lower limb arterial thrombosis and cancer is unknown. Wetherefore examined cancer risk and prognosis of cancer in patients with lowerlimb arterial thrombosis. Methods -Using nationwide population-based Danishmedical registries, we identified all patients diagnosed with first-time lowerlimb arterial thrombosis (1994-2013) and followed them until the occurrence ofany subsequent cancer diagnosis, emigration, death, or 30 November 2013,whichever came first. We computed standardized incidence ratios with 95%confidence intervals (CIs) as the observed number of cancers relative to theexpected number based on national incidence rates by sex, age, and calendar year.To examine the prognostic impact of lower limb arterial thrombosis on all-causemortality after cancer, we constructed a matched comparison cohort of cancerpatients without lower limb arterial thrombosis. Results -Among 6600 patientswith lower limb arterial thrombosis, we observed 772 subsequent cancers. The riskof any cancer was 2.5% after 6 months of follow-up, increasing to 17.9% after 20 years. During the first 6 months of follow-up, the standardized incidence ratioof any cancer was 3.28 (95% CI: 2.79-3.82). The standardized incidence ratioremained elevated during 7-12 months (1.42, 95% CI: 1.09-1.83) and beyond 12months (1.14, 95% CI: 1.05-1.24). The strongest associations were found for lung cancer and other smoking-related cancers. Lower limb arterial thrombosis also wasassociated with increased all-cause mortality after colon, lung, urinary bladder,and breast cancer, but not after prostate cancer. Conclusions -Lower limbarterial thrombosis was a marker of occult cancer, especially lung cancer, andwas an adverse prognostic factor for mortality in common cancers.DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.032617 PMID: 29540440
