This study investigated the clinicalefficacy and safety of the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin witheverolimus (GPE) in patients with metastatic TNBC. Methods: In phase I, weassessed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GPE in metastatic TNBC patients.Then, using a seamless design, we conducted a randomized phase II trial tocompare GPE to GP in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity. Inaddition, we investigated the mutational status of PIK3CA (E542K, E545K, H1047R) in tumor tissues (n=14) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from blood samples (n=23) usingdroplet digital PCR. Results: In phase I (n=9), we found that the MTD of GPE was gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 and cisplatin 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks along with everolimus 5 mg daily. Phase II was terminated early after 14 patients hadbeen enrolled because of slow recruitment and concerns about efficacy. Results ofthe combined analysis of phases I and II showed the objective response rate (ORR)of GPE (n=16) was 31.3% and the median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI, 3.5-7.5).Stomatitis and hematologic toxicities were observed most frequently in the GPEarm. PIK3CA mutations were identified in 8 (57.1%) tumor samples and 17 (73.9%)cfDNA samples; there was no significant association between PIK3CA mutationstatus and response to GPE treatment. Conclusions: Although the majority ofpatients with metastatic TNBC demonstrated PIK3CA mutations in cfDNA, theaddition of everolimus to gemcitabine/cisplatin did not have a synergistic effectin these patients. Further studies are needed to determine the most effective wayto target the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in TNBC patients.DOI: 10.7150/jca.24035 PMCID: PMC5907662PMID: 29675095
