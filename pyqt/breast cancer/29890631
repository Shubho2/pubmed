Eileen.mcgowan@uts.edu.au.Cancer research has been heavily geared towards genomic events in the developmentand progression of cancer. In contrast, metabolic regulation, such as aberrantmetabolism in cancer, is poorly understood. Alteration in cellular metabolism wasonce regarded simply as a consequence of cancer rather than as playing a primary role in cancer promotion and maintenance. Resurgence of cancer metabolismresearch has identified critical metabolic reprogramming events withinbiosynthetic and bioenergetic pathways needed to fulfill the requirements ofcancer cell growth and maintenance. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is emerging as a key regulator of metabolic processes and metabolic reprogramming in cancercells&mdash;balancing the pendulum between cell death and survival. This reviewprovides an overview of the classical and emerging non-classical tumor suppressorroles of p53 in regulating mitochondrial dynamics: mitochondrial engagement incell death processes in the prevention of cancer. On the other hand, we discussp53 as a key metabolic switch in cellular function and survival. The focus isthen on the conceivable roles of p53 in breast cancer metabolism. Understandingthe metabolic functions of p53 within breast cancer metabolism will, in duecourse, reveal critical metabolic hotspots that cancers advantageouslyre-engineer for sustenance. Illustration of these events will pave the way forfinding novel therapeutics that target cancer metabolism and serve to overcomethe breast cancer burden.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10060189 PMCID: PMC6024909PMID: 29890631
