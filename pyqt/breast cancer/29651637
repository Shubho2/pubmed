Epub 2018 Apr 12.An overview of mammographic density and its association with breast cancer.Nazari SS(1), Mukherjee P(2).Author information: (1)Department of Biological Sciences, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, University City Blvd 9201, Charlotte, NC, 28223-0001, USA.(2)Department of Biological Sciences, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, University City Blvd 9201, Charlotte, NC, 28223-0001, USA. pmukherj@uncc.edu.In 2017, breast cancer became the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women inthe US. After lung cancer, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-relatedmortality in women. The breast consists of several components, including milkstorage glands, milk ducts made of epithelial cells, adipose tissue, and stromal tissue. Mammographic density (MD) is based on the proportion of stromal,epithelial, and adipose tissue. Women with high MD have more stromal andepithelial cells and less fatty adipose tissue, and are more likely to developbreast cancer in their lifetime compared to women with low MD. Because of thiscorrelation, high MD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer. Further,mammographic screening is less effective in detecting suspicious lesions in densebreast tissue, which can lead to late-stage diagnosis. Molecular differencesbetween dense and non-dense breast tissues explain the underlying biologicalreasons for why women with dense breasts are at a higher risk for developingbreast cancer. The goal of this review is to highlight the current molecularunderstanding of MD, its association with breast cancer risk, the demographicspertaining to MD, and the environmental factors that modulate MD. Finally, wewill review the current legislation regarding the disclosure of MD on atraditional screening mammogram and the supplemental screening options available to women with dense breast tissue.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0857-5 PMCID: PMC5906528PMID: 29651637
