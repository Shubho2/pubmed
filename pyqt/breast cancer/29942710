While PI3K inhibitors havenot achieved expectant therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, and severalstudies provide promising combination strategies to substantially maximizetherapeutic outcomes. Besides its direct impact on regulating cancer cellssurvival, PI3K inhibitors are also demonstrated to have an immunomodulatoryimpact based on the tumor microenvironment. Inhibition of the leukocyte-enriched PI3K isoforms may break immune tolerance and restore cytotoxic T cell activity byreprogramming the tumor microenvironment. In addition, PI3K inhibitors havepleiotropic effects on tumor angiogenesis and even induce tumor vascularnormalization. In this review, we discuss the mechanism of PI3K inhibitorsuppression of breast cancer cells and modulation of the tumor microenvironmentin order to provide further thoughts for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.7717/peerj.5092 PMCID: PMC6014315PMID: 29942710
