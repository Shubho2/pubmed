Substitution of lysine 870with arginine completely abolishes α-catenin SUMOylation. This modification canbe removed by SENP1. However, α-catenin SUMOylation does not affect its stabilityand subcellular localization. In addition, we observed that theSUMOylation-deficient α-catenin mutant has a reduced interaction with IκBα which prevents subsequent ubiquitination of IκBα, and therefore a reduced suppressionof expression of the NF-κB target genes TNF-α, IL-8, VEGF, and uPA. In addition, the α-catenin SUMOylation mutant shows impaired suppression of tumor growth.These results demonstrate that SUMOylation at lysine 870 of α-catenin plays a keyrole in the suppression of the NF-κB pathway, which inhibits breast cancer tumor growth and migration.DOI: 10.1038/s41389-018-0037-7 PMCID: PMC5852976PMID: 29540699
