For quantitative analysis, we usedsemiautomated in-house software with MATLAB. From each voxel of whole breast, thesoftware calculated BPE using following equation: [(signal intensity [SI] at1 min 30 s after contrast injection - baseline SI)/baseline SI] × 100%.RESULTS: In total, 53 patients had minimal, 108 mild, 87 moderate, and 25 marked BPE. On quantitative analysis, mean BPE values were 33.1% in the minimal, 42.1%in the mild, 59.1% in the moderate, and 81.9% in the marked BPE group showingsignificant difference (p = .009 for minimal vs. mild, p < 0.001 for othercomparisons). Spearman's correlation test showed that there was strongsignificant correlation between qualitative and quantitative BPE (r = 0.63,p < 0.001). The mean BPE value was 48.7% for patients in the first week of themenstrual cycle, 43.5% in the second week, 49% in the third week, and 49.4% forthose in the fourth week. The difference between the second and fourth weeks was significant (p = .005). Median, 90th percentile, and 10th percentile values were also significantly different between the second and fourth weeks but notdifferent in other comparisons (first vs. second, first vs. third, first vs.fourth, second vs. third, or third vs. fourth).CONCLUSION: Quantitative analysis of BPE correlated well with the qualitative BPEgrade. Quantitative BPE values were lowest in the second week and highest in the fourth week.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejrad.2018.04.009 PMID: 29803391
