We evaluated the effect of surgical weight loss onmammographic density (MD).METHODS: Patients undergoing bariatric surgery and screening mammography (MG)were identified, data regarding demographics, comorbidities, calculated andgenetic breast cancer risk was collected. Patients had a MG before and aftersurgery. Fellowship-trained breast radiologists assigned Breast Imaging Reportingand Data System density categories.RESULTS: Patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy (n = 56) or gastric bypass(n = 7), 78% had hypertension, 48% had diabetes. Four had deleterious BRCAmutations, four were calculated high risk. Mean weight loss = 28.7 kg. Meaninitial BMI = 44.3 kg/m2 (range:33-77), final BMI = 33.6 kg/m2(range:20-62;p < 0.01). Density was unchanged in 53, decreased in 1, increased in9. Of these 9(14%), 5 changed from almost entirely fatty to scattered MD, and 4changed from scattered MD to heterogeneously dense. Mean weight loss of the 9with increased MD was greater than the cohort (37.7vs.28.7 kg;p < 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Surgical weight loss increased MD in 14%. Increased MD masksmalignancies, patients may benefit from additional screening based on calculated risk assessments that include MD.DOI: 10.1186/s12880-017-0242-4 PMCID: PMC5941592PMID: 29743035
