As a member ofHOX genes, HOXB5 is overexpressed in bladder cancer and contributes to theproliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. However, functions of HOXB5 inretinoblastoma remain elusive. In this study, we found that HOXB5 expression isupregulated in retinoblastoma cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of HOXB5promoted retinoblastoma cell migration and invasion, but knockdown of HOXB5suppressed the migration and invasion. Moreover, HOXB5 induced the activation of ERK1/2 and upregulated the production of MMP-3 and MMP-13. In addition, ERK1/2pathway was required for HOXB5-mediated retinoblastoma cell migration andinvasion. Taken together, our study suggests that HOXB5 promotes the migrationand invasion of retinoblastoma cells by inducing the activation of ERK1/2 andincreasing the production of MMP-3 and MMP-13. Therefore, HOXB5 may represent an effective target for treatment of retinoblastoma.PMCID: PMC6038074PMID: 30018711
