This plant hasbeen reported to relieve postmenopausal symptoms, prevent and reverse bone loss, inhibit the growth of breast cancer, and alleviate cardiovascular diseases inpreclinical and clinical studies. However, there is little information on theoral bioavailability and tissue distribution of puerarin with respect to itspharmacodynamic activities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine thepharmacokinetics of puerarin, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, andelimination, in rats. Moreover, this is the first study to examine the tissuedistribution of puerarin in the hippocampus, femur, tibia, and mammary gland.METHODS: Adult female rats were administered puerarin at 1 mg/kg intravenously or5 and 10 mg/kg orally. Blood, tissue, urine, and feces were collected andanalyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.RESULTS: Puerarin reached a maximum concentration in the blood of 140-230 μg/Lwithin 1 h of oral dosing, and had an absolute oral bioavailability ofapproximately 7%. Following intravenous administration, puerarin was widelydistributed in several tissues, including the hippocampus, heart, lung, stomach, liver, mammary gland, kidney, spleen, femur, and tibia. Approximately 50% of the intravenous dose was excreted as glucuronide metabolites via the urinary route.CONCLUSIONS: The absolute oral bioavailability of puerarin was approximately 7%at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg. Puerarin was widely distributed to several organsrelated to the diseases of aging, including the hippocampus, femur, tibia, andmammary gland. Glucuronides were the major metabolites of puerarin and weremainly excreted in the urine. These results are useful for the development ofpuerarin and Pueraria candollei var. mirifica as phytopharmaceutical products.DOI: 10.1186/s40360-018-0216-3 PMCID: PMC5970530PMID: 29801513
