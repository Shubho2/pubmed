Previous in-vivostudies proved the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for local delivery of thecommonest anticancer drug, paclitaxel (PTX). Dental pulp is a relatively abundantnoninvasive source of MSCs. We assess dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), for thefirst time, as anticancer drug carriers. Confocal Raman microscopy is a uniquetool to trace drug and cell viability without labeling.METHODS: Drug uptake and cell apoptosis are identified through confocal Ramanmicroscope. We traced translocation of cytochrome c enzyme from the mitochondria,as a biomarker for apoptosis, after testing both cancer and stem cells. Theviability of stem cells was checked by means of confocal Raman microscope and by cytotoxicity assays.RESULTS: In this study, we prove that DPSCs can be loaded in vitro with theanticancerous drug without affecting their viability, which is later released in the culture medium of breast cancer cells (MCF-7 cells) in a time-dependentfashion. The induced cytotoxic damage in MCF-7 cells was observed consequentlyafter PTX release by DPSCs. Additionally, quantitative Raman images ofintracellular drug uptake in DPSCs and MCF-7 cells were obtained. Cytotoxicassays prove the DPSCs to be more resistant to PTX as compared to bonemarrow-derived MSCs, provided similar conditions.CONCLUSIONS: Applications of dental stem cells for targeted treatment of cancercould be a revolution to reduce morbidity due to chemotherapy, and to increasethe efficacy of systemic cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s13287-018-0831-3 PMCID: PMC5897939PMID: 29650042
