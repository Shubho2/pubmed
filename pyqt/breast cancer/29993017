Glanded cottonseed has anticancerproperty and glandless cottonseed was reported to cause cancer in one animalstudy. It is important to investigate the effect of bioactive components fromcottonseeds. Our objectives were to isolate ethanol extracts from cottonseeds andinvestigate their effects on human cancer cells. A protocol was developed forisolating bioactive extracts from seed coat and kernel of glanded and glandlesscottonseeds. HPLC-MS analyzed the four ethanol extracts but only quercetin wasidentified in the glandless seed coat extract. Residual gossypol was detected in the glanded and glandless seed kernel extracts and but only in the glanded seedcoat extract. Ethanol extracts were used to treat human cancer cells derived frombreast and pancreas followed by MTT assay for cell viability. Ethanol extractsfrom glanded and glandless cottonseed kernels and gossypol significantlydecreased breast cancer cell mitochondrial activity. Ethanol extract from glandedcottonseed kernel and gossypol also significantly decreased pancreas cancer cell mitochondrial activity. These results suggest that ethanol extracts fromcottonseeds, like gossypol, contain anticancer activities.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-28773-4 PMCID: PMC6041348PMID: 29993017
