The 11q13 locus harbors FADS2 encoding Δ6desaturation which is not functional in several cancer cell lines, includinghormone positive MCF7 BC cells. In vitro, the non-functional FADS2 activityunmasks 18:2n-6 elongation to 20:2n-6 and Δ5 desaturation by FADS1 to yield5Z,11Z,14Z-20:3 (sciadonic acid) rather than 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-20:4 (arachidonicacid). In this pilot study we aimed to determine whether 5,11,14-20:3 appears in vivo in hormone positive human BC tissue. Fatty acids were profiled in surgicallyremoved human breast tumor and adjacent normal tissue (n = 9). Sciadonic acid wasdetected in three of nine breast tumor samples and was below detect limits innormal breast tissue. The internal Δ8 double bond of arachidonic acid is requiredfor normal eicosanoid synthesis but is missing in sciadonic acid. This pilotstudy demonstrates for the first time in vivo sciadonic acid in hormone positive BC tissue, warranting a larger survey study to further evaluate its appearanceand the functional implications.Copyright © 2018.
