China.MircroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as essential regulators in the tumorigenesisand chemoresistance of multiple cancer types. In the present study, it wasdemonstrated that the expression levels of miR-125b were significantlydownregulated in the tissues of patients with breast cancer (BC), as well as the BC cell lines in vitro. To study the association between chemoresistance andmiR-125b in BC, doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/R) cells wereestablished, and gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed. It wasdemonstrated that the overexpression of miR-125b increased the sensitivity ofMCF-7/R cells to DOX. Furthermore, it was revealed that the sensitization ofmiR-125b mimics to DOX-induced cell death was regulated by the hematopoieticcell-specific protein 1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) vector and HAX-1 smallinterfering RNA. These results emphasized the notable function of miR-125b andits target of HAX-1 in regulating DOX-resistance. In addition, it wasdemonstrated that the miR-125b mimics promoted the loss of the mitochondrialmembrane potential and the generation of reactive oxygen species induced by DOXtreatment in MCF-7/R cells. These data suggest that themiR-125b-HAX-1-mitochondria pathway has a notable function in the treatment ofDOX-resistant BC cells, which may provide a novel target for the chemotherapy of BC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7476 PMCID: PMC5774474PMID: 29434858
