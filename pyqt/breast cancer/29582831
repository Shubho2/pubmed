Indian J Ophthalmol. 2018 Aug;66(8):1231.A 67-year-old woman presented with metamorphopsia in the right eye. Leopardmottling was seen temporal to the fovea oculus dexter with corresponding hyper-and hypo-autofluorescent lesions on fundus autofluorescence. Spectraldomain-optical coherence tomography revealed hyperreflective dots in the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid with subretinal fluid (SRF). Intravitrealbevacizumab was administered with which SRF resolved, albeit with increase in theareas of mottling. The patient was diagnosed to have metastatic ductal carcinoma of the right breast.
