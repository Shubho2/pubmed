Deep learning usually requires large datasets to train networks of a certain depth from scratch. Transfer learning is aneffective method to deal with relatively small datasets as in the case of medicalimages, although it can be tricky as we can easily start overfitting.RESULTS: In this work, we explore the importance of transfer learning and weexperimentally determine the best fine-tuning strategy to adopt when training aCNN model. We were able to successfully fine-tune some of the recent, mostpowerful CNNs and achieved better results compared to other state-of-the-artmethods which classified the same public datasets. For instance we achieved97.35% accuracy and 0.98 AUC on the DDSM database, 95.50% accuracy and 0.97 AUCon the INbreast database and 96.67% accuracy and 0.96 AUC on the BCDR database.Furthermore, after pre-processing and normalizing all the extracted Regions ofInterest (ROIs) from the full mammograms, we merged all the datasets to build onelarge set of images and used it to fine-tune our CNNs. The CNN model whichachieved the best results, a 98.94% accuracy, was used as a baseline to build theBreast Cancer Screening Framework. To evaluate the proposed CAD system and itsefficiency to classify new images, we tested it on an independent database (MIAS)and got 98.23% accuracy and 0.99 AUC.CONCLUSION: The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed framework isperformant and can indeed be used to predict if the mass lesions are benign ormalignant.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
