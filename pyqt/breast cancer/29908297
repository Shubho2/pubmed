The aim of the randomized, double-blind ProBONE II trial was toinvestigate whether a 2-year adjuvant treatment with 4 mg intravenous zoledronic acid (ZOL) every 3 months versus placebo would prevent CTIBL after a five-yearperiod.METHODS: Thirty-one of the 34 participants in the ZOL arm and thirty-four of the 36 participants in the placebo arm were followed-up to the 5-year visit andcompleted the study as planned. The changes in Bone Mass Density (BMD) wereassessed at baseline and each visit after treatment initiation.RESULTS: After 24 months, BMD at the lumbar spine showed a 2.9% increase inpatients treated with ZOL vs. a 7.1% decrease in placebo-treated participantscompared to baseline (p < 0.001). Over the 60-month study period, we found adecrease of 2.2% vs. 7.3% in the BMD at the lumbar spine in patients receivingZOL and placebo respectively (p < 0.001). Over the 60-month study period, BMD in the placebo arm showed a continuous decrease at all sites (p < 0001), whereaspatients treated with ZOL reached baseline BMD-values at the femoral neck andtotal hip.CONCLUSIONS: In ProBone II, a 2-year treatment with ZOL 4 mg intravenous every3 months prevented cancer treatment induced bone loss in premenopausal women withbreast cancer and maintained the BMD up to 3 years post-treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
