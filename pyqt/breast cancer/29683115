Ideally, thisconsultation should be conducted face-to-face to provide the education andpsychosocial and practical support that patients undergoing breast surgeryrequire. When this is not possible, a telephone consultation should be offered,as opposed to waiting until after surgery.DOI: 10.1188/18.ONF.389-398 PMID: 29683115
