Conventionally-fractionated whole breastirradiation (CF-WBI) has been the standard RT regimen, but recently shortercourses of hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) have been advocatedfor patient convenience and reduction in healthcare costs and resources. Areascovered: This review covers the major randomized European and Canadian trialscomparing HF-WBI to CF-WBI with long-term follow-up, as well as additionalrecently closed randomized trials that further seek to define the applicabilityof HF-WBI in clinical practice. Randomized data is summarized in terms ofclinical utility and for a variety of clinical applications. Recently publishedconsensus guidelines and practical implementation of HF-WBI including its broadereffect on the healthcare system are reviewed. Finally, an assessment of theemerging evidence in support of hypofractionation for locally advanced disease ispresented. Expert commentary: HF-WBI has replaced CF-WBI as the accepted standardof care in most women with early-stage breast cancer who do not require regional nodal irradiation. Early data supports the continued study of hypofractionationin the locally advanced setting, however broad adoption awaits longer follow-upand additional data from ongoing clinical trials.DOI: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1489245 PMID: 29902386
