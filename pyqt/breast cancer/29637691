The absorption spectral characteristics of R1-R3 werebathochromically tuned to the visible region by extending the π conjugation.These target compounds were weakly fluorescent in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution because of rapid isomerization of the C=N double bond in the excited state.However, the aqueous dispersion of R1-R3 in the THF/water mixture by the gradual addition of water up to 90% resulted in an increase in the fluorescence intensitymainly due to aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) properties. Theformation of nanoaggregates of R1-R3 were confirmed by scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. The compoundsR1-R3 are ideal probes for the fluorescence sensing of bovine serum albumin (BSA)and breast cancer cells by optical cell imaging.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/bio.3477 PMID: 29637691
