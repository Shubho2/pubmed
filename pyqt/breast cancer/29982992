Novel agents effectively targeting breastCSCs are urging to be discovered to overcome cancer relapse and metastasis. Werecently established a CSC-like model through ectopic expression Nanog, a corepluripotency factor, in breast cancer cells and validated induced CSC-like(MCF7-Nanog) model acquired stem-like properties. Using this model, we found thatsmenospongine (Sme), a natural sesquiterpene aminoquinone isolated from marinesponge Spongia pertusa Esper, preferentially inhibited the induced CSC-like cellsproliferation by inducing G0/G1 arrest and intrinsic apoptosis via increasing thephosphorylation level of p38 and AMPKα. Importantly, Sme exhibited the ability toabrogate CSC-like cells associated with a downregulation of stem cell markersincluding Nanog, Sox2, and Bmi1. Functionally, Sme inhibited the ability ofMCF7-Nanog cells to form tumor sphere in vitro and develop tumor in vivo.Significant antitumor effects are observed in Sme-treated mouse xenograft tumormodels, with no apparent toxicity to mice. Taken together, our findings provide aCSC-like model to identify novel CSC-targeting drugs and identify Sme as acandidate natural agent for treatment of breast cancer.© 2018 The Authors.
