The ORAI-STIM signaling occurs atmembrane contact sites formed by close appositions between the endoplasmicreticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane. ORAI1 is a four-pass transmembraneprotein that forms a highly calcium-selective ion channel in the plasma membrane.STIM1 is an ER-resident, a single-pass transmembrane protein that serves as acalcium sensor within the ER lumen and a potent activator of ORAI1 calciumchannels. The intricate interplay between ORAI and STIM controls calcium entryinto cells to regulate a myriad of physiological processes. We highlight hereinthe current knowledge on the structure-function relationship of CRAC channel,with a focus on key structural elements that mediate STIM1 conformational switch and the dynamic coupling between STIM1 and ORAI1. Furthermore, we discuss thephysiological roles of STIM-ORAI signaling in various tissues and organs, as wellas major pathological conditions arising from loss- or gain-of-function mutationsin human ORAI1 and STIM1. © 2017 American Physiological Society.
