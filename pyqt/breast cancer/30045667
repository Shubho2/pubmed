However, soft tissue sarcomas are characterized by tissue inhomogeneityand, consequently, by variable electrical characteristic of tumor tissue. Theinhomogeneity in conductivity represents the cause of local variations in theelectric field intensity. Crucially, this fact may hamper the achievement of the electroporation threshold during the electrochemotherapy procedure. In order toevaluate the effect of tissue inhomogeneity on the electric field distribution,we first performed ex vivo analysis of some clinical cases to quantify theinhomogeneity area. Subsequently, we performed some simulations where theelectric field intensity was evaluated by means of finite element analysis. Theresults of the simulation models are finally compared to an experimental modelbased on potato and tissue mimic materials. Tissue mimic materials are materials where the conductivity can be suitably designed. The coupling of computation and experimental results could be helpful to show the effect of the inhomogeneity in terms of variation in electric field distribution and characteristics.DOI: 10.1177/1533033818789693 PMCID: PMC6071161PMID: 30045667
