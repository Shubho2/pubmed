Cumulative CNS metastasis incidence and post-CNSmetastasis overall survival (OS) estimates were computed. Multivariable Coxproportional hazard models explored factors for post-CNS metastasis survival.RESULTS: A total of 2323 patients were identified (589-IBC/1734-NI-IDC).Eighty-one IBC patients developed CNS metastasis, versus 154 NI-IDC patients. The2-, 5-, and 10-year cumulative CNS metastasis incidence rates in IBC and NI-IDCwere 9.8%, 15.8%, 17.4% and 6.5%, 10.1%, and 12.7%, respectively. This wassignificantly different between IBC and NI-IDC patients (P = .0037).Multicovariate competing risk regression models in IBC and NI-IDC patients showedno statistically significant associations with the risk of developing CNSmetastasis, except neoadjuvant taxane use in NI-IDC patients (hazard ratio, 0.45;95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.83; P = .011). The median follow-up was 7.2years, and the median post-CNS metastasis OS was not significantly differentbetween IBC (7.6 months) and NI-IDC (5.6 months) patients. One hundred ninetypatients with CNS metastasis died. HER2-positive patients had better OS, with amedian 14.1 versus 4.3 months (P < .0001). Age >50 years (P = .012) but not IBCstatus was a significant predictor of post-CNS metastasis survival.CONCLUSION: IBC patients demonstrated higher CNS metastasis incidence rates butOS following CNS metastases is similar in both groups. HER2 status and age mayplay prognostic roles. Cancer 2018;124:2299-305. © 2018 American Cancer Society.© 2018 American Cancer Society.DOI: 10.1002/cncr.31336 PMID: 29579338
