In this study, we aimed to evaluate the predictive and prognostic role of the pretreatmentneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) incervical cancer. We retrospectively investigated 616 patients who underwentinitial radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical cancerbetween July 2012 and December 2014 in China. Their clinical andhistopathological markers and complete blood counts were obtained and analyzed.Then we chose the group of 339 of the total 616 patients who were not combinedpreoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy for the survival analysis. Prognosticfactors were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. The ROC curverevealed NLR and PLR had significant ability to predict parametrial involvement, and the cutoff values for NLR and PLR were 2.5 and 138.8 respectively.Clinicopathologic analysis showed that NLR was linked to age, parametrialinvolvement, tumor-invasion depth and histologic grade, and PLR was related toage, parametrial involvement, tumor-invasion depth and FIGO stage. Univariateanalysis identified high PLR as a significant poor predictor for progression-freesurvival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and NLR exhibited no predict power onOS or PFS. Multivariable analysis showed that PLR was an independent predictor ofPFS, but not OS. NLR and PLR were associated with the clinical characteristics ofcervical cancer. Additionally, PLR had independence prognostic value for PFS inpatients with cervical cancer receiving radical hysterectomy with pelviclymphadenectomy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
