In the present study, we engineered doxorubicin (DOX)-conjugated anti-mucin -1 (MUC-1) aptamer (Ap)-armed PEGylatedSPIONs for targeted delivery of DOX molecules to the breast cancer MCF-7 cells.Methods: The SPIONs were synthesized using the thermal decomposition method andmodified by polyethylene glycol (PEG) to maximize their biocompatibility andminimize any undesired cytotoxicity effects. Subsequently, DOX molecules wereloaded onto the SPIONs, which were further armed with amine-modified MUC-1aptamer by EDC/NHS chemistry. Results: The morphologic and size analyses ofnanoparticles (NPs) by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic lightscattering (DLS) revealed spherical and monodisperse MNPs with a size range of5-64 nm. The FT-IR spectrophotometry and 1 HNMR analysis confirmed the surfacemodification of NPs. The cytotoxicity assay of the aptamer-armed MNPs exhibited ahigher death rate in the MUC-1 over-expressing MCF-7 cells as compared to theMUC-1 under-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells. The flow cytometry analysis of theengineered Ap-armed SPIONs revealed a higher uptake as compared to the SPIONsalone. Conclusion: Based on our findings, the anti-MUC-1 Ap-armed PEGylatedSPIONs loaded with DOX molecules could serve as an effective multifunctionaltheranostics for simultaneous detection and eradication of MUC-1-positive breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.15171/bi.2018.14 PMCID: PMC6026525PMID: 29977833
