We aimed to identify miRNAs that wereassociated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) and prognosis in breast cancerpatients. A miRNA microarray covering 2019 mature miRNAs was used to identifydifferentially expressed miRNAs in 9 patients with LNM and 3 patients withoutLNM. Thirty-five differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which 10significantly were up-regulated, whereas the other 25 were down-regulated intissues with LNM compared with those without LNM. Seven miRNAs were subjected to quantitative real-time polymerase chain PCR (qRT-PCR) reaction, and 4 miRNAs(miR-191-5p, miR-214-3p, miR-451a, and miR-489) were validated in a total of 159 patients including a training set (n = 64) and a validation set (n = 95). The 4miRNAs were used to construct a miRNA signature by logistic regression. Riskscores derived from the 4-miRNA signature were calculated to stratify thepatients into high- or low-risk groups. Patients with high-risk scores had pooreroverall survival and disease-free survival than did those with low-risk scores.The miRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor. MiR-191-5p increased,whereas miR-214-3p, miR-451a, and miR-489 inhibited cell proliferation,migration, and invasion abilities. The 4-miRNA signature may be a reliableprognostic and predictive tool for metastasis and survival in breast cancerpatients.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
