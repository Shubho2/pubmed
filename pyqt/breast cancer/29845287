To investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with the interactions between lapatinib andcapecitabine, the effect of treatment with lapatinib andphosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase (PI3K) inhibitors on theexpression of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and thymidylate synthase (TS),which is associated with an increased response to 5‑fluorouracil (5‑FU)‑basedchemotherapy, was determined in HER2‑positive breast cancer cells. The results ofreverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated thatadministration of lapatinib and PI3K inhibitors decreased the mRNA expression of TS and E2F1, a transcription factor that promotes TS gene expression, in SKBR3and T47D cell lines. Furthermore, treatment with lapatinib and PI3K inhibitorsalso suppressed the mRNA expression of ribonucleotide reductase M1 subunit(RRM1), an important determinant of gemcitabine resistance, and DNA topoisomeraseII‑α (TOP2A), a molecular target of anthracyclines, in SKBR3 and T47D cell lines.Western blot analysis further demonstrated that the phosphorylation of Akt wasinhibited by lapatinib, and the results of the MTT assay revealed that thecombination of lapatinib with either 5‑FU or gemcitabine demonstrated synergisticantitumor effects, whereas a combinatory treatment of lapatinib with epirubicin, a typical anthracycline drug, exhibited antagonistic antitumor effects inHER2‑positive breast cancer cells. These results indicate that the synergisticantitumor effects exhibited by combinatory treatment of lapatinib withcapecitabine may be induced via the suppression of E2F1‑mediated TS expression.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9068 PMID: 29845287
