Prior small studies with variable controlfor baseline characteristics suggest superior satisfaction with NSM. The purpose of this study was to compare patient satisfaction following NSM and totalmastectomy (TM) utilizing the BREAST-Q patient-reported outcome measure in awell-characterized patient population.METHODS: Patients at a single institution undergoing NSM or TM with immediatetissue expander/implant reconstruction who completed a follow-up BREAST-Q from2007 to 2017 were identified by retrospective review of a prospective database.Baseline characteristics were compared, and linear mixed models were used toanalyze associations with BREAST-Q scores over time.RESULTS: Of 1866 eligible patients, 219 (12%) underwent NSM, and 1647 (88%)underwent TM. Median time from baseline to BREAST-Q was 658Â days. Patients withNSM were younger, more likely to be white, and had lower BMI. They more often hadprophylactic surgery, bilateral mastectomies, lower-stage disease, and less oftenreceived chemotherapy/radiation than patients with TM. On multivariable analysis,after controlling for relevant clinical variables, there was no difference insatisfaction with breasts or satisfaction with outcome overall between NSM and TMpatients. Psychosocial well-being and sexual well-being were significantly higherin the NSM group. After additionally controlling for preoperative BREAST-Q score in a subset of patients (72 NSM; 443 TM), only psychosocial well-being remainedsignificantly higher in NSM patients.CONCLUSIONS: Patient-reported outcomes should be discussed with women weighingthe risks and benefits of NSM to provide a better understanding of expectedquality of life.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6585-4 PMID: 29968023
