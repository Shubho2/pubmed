Although vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT)and lymphovenous anastomosis are used to surgically treat patients withlymphedema, it is not known whether musculocutaneous or adipocutaneous flaps (eg,delayed autologous breast reconstruction) are effective for treating refractoryupper extremity BCRL. We conducted a systematic review and pooled analysis toassess the impact of delayed breast reconstruction on developed BCRL.METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases for relevant studies published throughNovember 11, 2016. We screened 934 unique articles. Of these, we conductedfull-text and reference screening on 37 articles. We then performed a pooled and sensitivity analysis using random effects.RESULTS: Eight studies met our inclusion criteria. One study was a case report; 7studies were case series with sample sizes ranging from 3 to 38 patients.According to our pooled analysis 58% of patients reported improvement afterbreast reconstruction with or without VLNT. Sensitivity analysis revealed that84% (95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.95) of patients who underwent breastreconstruction and VLNT reported improvement, whereas only 22% (95% confidenceinterval, 0.12-0.32) of those who had breast reconstruction alone reportedimprovement.CONCLUSIONS: Our review summarizes the current evidence regarding the effect ofdelayed breast reconstruction on established lymphedema. The VLNT component ofthe autologous breast reconstruction procedures may be the largest contributingfactor leading to lymphedema improvement.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001542 PMID: 29944525
