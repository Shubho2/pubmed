NAT1 expression is widely reported to be associated with ESR1expression and is frequently investigated in breast cancer etiology. Furthermore,the NAT2 phenotype has been reported to modify breast cancer risk in molecularepidemiological association studies. Understanding the relationships between the expression levels of these genes is essential to understand their role in breast cancer etiology and treatment. In the present study, NAT1, NAT2 and ESR1expression data were accessed from repositories of RNA‑Seq data covering57 breast cancer cell lines, 1,043 primary breast tumors and 99 normal breasttissues. The relationships between gene expression, and between NAT1 activity andRNA expression in breast cancer cell lines were evaluated using non-parametricstatistical analyses. Differences in gene expression in each dataset, as well as gene expression differences in normal breast tissue compared to primary breasttumors, and stratification by estrogen receptor status were determined. NAT1 and NAT2 mRNA expression were detected in normal and primary breast tumor tissues;NAT1 expression was much higher than NAT2. NAT1 and ESR1 expression were stronglyassociated, whereas NAT2 and ESR1 expression were not. Although NAT1 and NAT2expression were associated, the magnitude was moderate. NAT1, NAT2, and ESR1expression were increased in primary breast tumor tissue compared with normalbreast tissue; however, the magnitude and significance of the differences werelower for NAT2. Analysis of NAT1, NAT2, and ESR1 expression in normal and primarybreast tissues and breast cancer cell lines suggested that NAT1 and NAT2expression are regulated by distinctive mechanisms, whereas NAT1 and ESR1expression may have overlapping regulation. Defining these relationships isimportant for future investigations into breast cancer prevention.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4436 PMCID: PMC6017241PMID: 29901116
