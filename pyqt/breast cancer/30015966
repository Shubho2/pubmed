Although DMBA‑ andErbB2‑mediated breast cancers are well‑studied in their respective models, keyinteractions between environmental and genetic factors on breast cancer riskremain unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect ofDMBA exposure on ErbB2‑mediated mammary tumorigenesis. MMTV‑ErbB2 transgenic miceexposed to DMBA (1 mg) via weekly oral gavage for 6 weeks exhibited significantlyenhanced mammary tumor development, as indicated by reduced tumor latency andincreased tumor multiplicity compared with control mice. Whole mount analysis of premalignant mammary tissues from 15‑week‑old mice revealed increased ductalelongation and proliferative index in DMBA‑exposed mice. Molecular analyses ofpremalignant mammary tissues further indicated that DMBA exposure enhancedepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ErbB2 and estrogen receptor (ER)signaling, which was associated with increased mRNA levels of EGFR/ErbB2 familymembers and ER‑targeted genes. Furthermore, analysis of tumor karyotypes revealedthat DMBA‑exposed tumors displayed more chromosomal alterations compared withcontrol tumors, implicating DMBA‑induced chromosomal instability in tumorpromotion in this model. Together, the data suggested that DMBA‑inducedderegulation of EGFR/ErbB2‑ER pathways plays a critical role in the enhancedchromosomal instability and promotion of ErbB2‑mediated mammary tumorigenesis.The study highlighted gene‑environment interactions that may increase risk ofbreast cancer, which is a critical clinical issue.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6545 PMID: 30015966
