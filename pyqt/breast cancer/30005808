The purpose of this study was to assess adoption andoutcomes of RSL at 3 academic hospitals in our city.METHODS: Data for consecutive invasive and in-situ breast cancer cases localized with RSL or WL at 3 hospitals between January 2012 and February 2016 wereabstracted. Data analysis was conducted using the Student's t-test, ANOVA withTukey's HSD test for post-hoc multiple comparisons, and chi-squared test.RESULTS: There were 803 consecutive cases. Hospital 1 exclusively used RSL (247cases), whereas H2 adopted RSL (109 cases), but continued to use WL (347 cases). Hospital 3 exclusively used WL (100 cases). There was no difference between RSLand WL groups in positive margin rate (p = 0.337), re-operation (p = 0.413), ormean specimen volume (p = 0.190).DISCUSSION: There has been variable adoption of RSL in our city. Despite this,relevant surgical outcomes have been similar across groups. The causes ofvariable adoption of this novel technique merit further investigation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
