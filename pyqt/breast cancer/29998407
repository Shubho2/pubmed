[Epub ahead ofprint]Underdiagnosis of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer in Medicare Patients:Genetic Testing Criteria Miss the Mark.Yang S(1), Axilbund JE(1), O'Leary E(1), Michalski ST(1), Evans R(1), LincolnSE(1), Esplin ED(2), Nussbaum RL(1).Author information: (1)Invitae, San Francisco, USA.(2)Invitae, San Francisco, USA. ed.esplin@invitae.com.BACKGROUND: An estimated 5-10% of breast and ovarian cancers are due tohereditary causes such as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome.Medicare, the third-party payer that covers 44 million patients in the UnitedStates, has implemented a set of clinical criteria to determine coverage for the testing of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. These criteria, developed to identifycarriers of BRCA1/2 variants, have not been evaluated in the panel testing era.This study investigated a series of Medicare patients undergoing genetic testing for HBOC to determine the efficacy of genetic testing criteria in identifyingpatients with hereditary risk.METHODS: This study retrospectively examined de-identified data from aconsecutive series of Medicare patients undergoing genetic testing based onpersonal and family history of breast and gynecologic cancer. Ordering cliniciansindicated whether patients did or did not meet established criteria for BRCA1/2genetic testing. The genetic test results were compared between the group thatmet the criteria and the group that did not. Patients in families with knownpathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants were excluded from the primary analysis.RESULTS: Among 4196 unique Medicare patients, the rate of P/LP variants for thepatients who met the criteria for genetic testing was 10.5%, and for those whodid not, the rate was 9% (p = 0.26).CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that a substantial number ofMedicare patients with clinically actionable genetic variants are being missed bycurrent testing criteria and suggest the need for significant expansion andsimplification of the testing criteria for HBOC.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6621-4 PMID: 29998407
