Recalled findings prospectively seen on oneview only were analyzed. Pearson chi-square test and Fisher exact test wereperformed, and 95% CIs were determined.RESULTS: Mammograms were acquired using FFDM (n = 71,656) and FFDM-DBT (n =31,414) during the study period, and 2213 FFDM (3.1%) and 433 FFDM-DBT (1.4%)mammograms were recalled for one-view-only findings (p < 0.0001). The final studypopulation (1592 FFDM and 354 FFDM-DBT) was defined after 689 of these recalledFFDM and 92 of these recalled FFDM-DBT examinations were excluded forinsufficient mammographic follow-up (< 24 months). Summation artifacts accounted for more one-view-only findings from FFDM (1067/1592; 67.0%) than FFDM-DBT(190/354; 53.7%) (p < 0.0001). In the FFDM cohort, 28 one-view-only findingsproved malignant (24 invasive ductal carcinoma [IDC], one invasive lobularcarcinoma [ILC], and three ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]). In the FFDM-DBTcohort, 14 one-view-only findings proved malignant (11 IDC, one ILC, and twoDCIS). The positive predictive value (PPV) of a one-view-only finding wassignificantly lower for FFDM (1.8%) than for FFDM-DBT (4.0%) (p = 0.010).CONCLUSION: One-view-only findings occur with both FFDM and FFDM-DBT and remainan important but uncommon sign of malignancy. They are more frequent, are morelikely to represent summation artifacts, and have a lower PPV with FFDM than withFFDM-DBT.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.19023 PMID: 29792742
