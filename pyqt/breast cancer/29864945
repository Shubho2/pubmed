The present study was aimed to evaluate the effectof octyl gallate (OG) and gallic acid (GA) isolated from methanolic fruit extractof T. bellirica to inhibit the survival of breast cancer cells (MCF-7 &MDA-MB-231). Both OG & GA exhibited decreased MCF-7 & MDA-MB-231 survival andinduced apoptosis, with IC50 value of OG and GA as 40 μM and 80 μM respectively. No toxic effect was observed on normal breast cells (MCF-10A). The compoundsinhibited cell cycle progression by altering the expression of the cell cycleregulators (Cyclin D1, D3, CDK-4, CDK-6, p18 INK4, p21Waf-1 and p27 KIP). Octylgallate was more effective at low concentrations than GA. In-silico resultsprovided stable interactions between the compounds and target proteins. Thepresent investigation proved the downregulation of positive cell cycle regulatorsand upregulation of negative cell cycle regulators inducing apoptosis incompound-treated breast cancer cells. Hence, both the compounds may serve aspotential anticancer agents and could be developed as breast cancer drugs, withfurther explorations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
