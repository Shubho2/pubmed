We aimed todescribe cancer incidence data from the Cancer Registry of the Maputo CentralHospital (MCH) in 2015-2016, for Maputo City dwellers, and to compare theincidence rates with those observed in 1956-1961. Cancers with incidence data in 2015-2016 were identified by the Cancer Registry of the MCH. Crude andage-standardized incident rates (ASIR, per 100 000) - direct method, worldstandard population - were computed for Maputo City, under the assumption thatmost cancer cases among this population were identified at the MCH. A total of1707 incident cases in Maputo City dwellers were registered (76.6% confirmedhistologically). Prostate cancer, Kaposi sarcoma, and liver cancer were the most frequent in men (ASIR: 24.5, 19.8, and 13.3, respectively). Cervical and breastcancers, and Kaposi sarcoma were the most common among women (ASIR: 32.4, 11.8,and 9.5, respectively). Compared with the data from 1956 to 1961, the mostpronounced declines in ASIR were for bladder and liver cancers, in both sexes,and increases were greater for prostate cancer among men (172.2%) and breastcancer (237.1%) among women. Our study highlights the high frequency ofinfection-related cancers in Maputo, but also of those related to the ongoingdemographic and socioeconomic transition.DOI: 10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000457 PMID: 29939861
