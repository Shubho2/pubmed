COX2 gene expression was assessed by reverse transcription andquantitative polymerase chain reaction using ribonucleic acid from frozenbiopsies. Pathological complete response (pCR) was the surrogate end-point.RESULTS: Significantly higher rates of grade 3, and estrogen and progesteronereceptor negativity were observed in tumors with the highest expression of COX2. pCR rates were significantly higher in COX2-overexpressing tumors in patientsreceiving celecoxib. The test for interaction between COX2 gene expression andthe celecoxib effect was statistically significant (p<0.01), but was not retainedin the multivariate analysis.CONCLUSION: COX2 overexpression is predictive of pCR in patients withcelecoxib-treated tumors. The efficacy of celecoxib in breast cancer might beimproved by quantification of COX2 gene expression.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12375 PMID: 29491076  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
