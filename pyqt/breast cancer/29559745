Although soluble tumor necrosis factor-α (sTNF-α) has been implicated in mediating drug-resistance in human cancers, whether transmembrane tumor necrosis factor-α (tmTNF-α) plays a role in chemoresistance remains unclear. Here we foundthat over 50% of studied patients expressed tmTNF-α at high levels in breastcancer tissues and tmTNF-α expression positively correlated with resistance toanthracycline chemotherapy. Alteration of tmTNF-α expression changed thesensitivity of primary human breast cancer cells and breast cancer cell lines to doxorubicin (DOX). Overexpression of N-terminal fragment (NTF) of tmTNF-α, amutant form with intact intracellular domain of tmTNF-α to transmit reversesignals, induced DOX-resistance. Mechanistically, the tmTNF-α/NTF-ERK-GST-π axis and tmTNF-α/NTF-NF-κB-mediated anti-apoptotic functions were required fortmTNF-α-induced DOX-resistance. In a xenograft mouse model, the combination oftmTNF-α suppression with chemotherapy significantly enhanced the efficacy of DOX.Our data indicate that tmTNF-α mediates DOX-resistance through reverse signaling and targeting tmTNF-α may be beneficial for the treatment of DOX-resistant breastcancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0221-4 PMCID: PMC6013421PMID: 29559745
