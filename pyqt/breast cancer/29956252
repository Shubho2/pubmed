Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital, Columbia, MO,USA.Adhesive interactions between living cells or ligand-receptor interactions can bestudied at the molecular level using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Adhesionforce measurements are performed with functionalized AFM probes. In order tomeasure single ligand-receptor interactions, a cantilever with a pyramidal tip isfunctionalized with a bio-recognized ligand (e.g., extracellular matrix protein).The ligand-functionalized probe is then brought into contact with a cell inculture to investigate adhesion between the respective probe-bound ligand andendogenously expressed cell surface receptors (e.g., integrins or other adhesion receptor). For experiments designed to examine cell-cell adhesions, a single cellis attached to a tipless cantilever which is then brought into contact with othercultured cells. Force curves are recorded to determine the forces necessary torupture discrete adhesions between the probe-bound ligand and receptor, or todetermine total adhesion force at cell-cell contacts. Here, we describe theprocedures for measuring adhesions between (a) fibronectin and α5β1 integrin, and(b) breast cancer cells and bone marrow endothelial cells.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-8591-3_30 PMID: 29956252
