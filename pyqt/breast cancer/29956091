This study aimed to determine thereasons for litigation for breast cancer care during the past 17 years byreviewing a public legal database.METHODS: The LexisNexis legal database was queried using a comprehensive list of terms related to breast cancer, identifying all cases from 2000 to 2017. Datawere abstracted, and descriptive analyses were performed.RESULTS: The study identified 264 cases of litigation pertaining to breast cancercare. Delay in breast cancer diagnosis was the most common reason for litigation (n = 156, 59.1%), followed by improperly performed procedures (n = 26, 9.8%). Themedical specialties most frequently named in lawsuits as primary defendants were radiology (n = 76, 28.8%), general surgery (n = 74, 28%), and primary care(n = 52, 19.7%). The verdict favored the defendant in 145 cases (54.9%) and theplantiff in 60 cases (22.7%). In 59 cases (22.3%), a settlement was reached outof court. The median plaintiff verdict payouts ($1,485,000) were greater than thesettlement payouts ($862,500) (p = 0.04).CONCLUSION: Failure to diagnose breast cancer in a timely manner was the mostcommon reason for litigation related to breast cancer care in the United States. General surgery was the second most common specialty named in the malpracticecases studied. Most cases were decided in favor of the defendant, but when theplaintiff received a payout, the amount often was substantial. Identifying themost common reasons for litigation may help decrease this rate and improve thepatient experience.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6579-2 PMID: 29956091
