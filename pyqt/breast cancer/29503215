Today the decision to offersurgery is based on a woman's fitness rather than her age.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare the experience ofpostoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), anxiety, and reported pain levels inwomen who represent four different age groups after breast cancer surgery. Thisstudy employed a prospective comparative design. A large women's hospital whichhouses a Comprehensive Breast Care Program. Women diagnosed with early stagebreast cancer and scheduled for surgical resection.METHODS: Postoperative pain was measured in the postanesthesia care unit using an11-point verbal pain scale, PONV was measured categorically, and if present,severity of nausea was assessed. Anxiety was measured preoperatively by theshort-form Profile of Mood States.FINDINGS: A total of 97 women aged 37-78 participated in this study. Overall, 35%of all women experienced PONV; only two women (18%) in the highest age range(70-79) experienced PONV, yet they reported significantly more pain than women inthe other age groups. Understanding the difference in postoperative symptomsexperienced by older woman after surgery for breast cancer will support thedevelopment of age-specific strategies.Copyright Â© 2018 American Society for Pain Management Nursing.
