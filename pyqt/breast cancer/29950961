Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been identified as apredictive marker for pCR after NACT in TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer.These patient populations could also be suitable for novel treatment strategiesincluding neoepitope-based therapies. This work analyses the effect of TILs onthe pCR in neoadjuvantly treated patients in the TILGen study and presents theprocedures aimed at establishing neoepitope-based therapies in this study.Methods: Neoadjuvantly treated HER2-positive and TNBC patients were eligible for the presented analysis concerning the association between TILs and pCR. A totalof 146 patients could be identified within the TILGen study. TILs were evaluated as percentage of stromal tumor tissue in core biopsies at primary diagnosis. The phenotype 'lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer' (LPBC) was associated with pCRby logistic regression adjusted for estrogen receptor status, progesteronereceptor status, HER2 status, age at diagnosis, and grading.Results: LPBC was seen in 24 (16.4%) patients. In this patient group, 66.7%achieved a pCR, while the pCR rate was 32.8% in patients with a low TIL count.The adjusted odds ratio was 6.60 (95% confidence interval 2.02-21.56; p < 0.01).Conclusion: TILs are a strong predictor of pCR in TNBC and HER2-positive breastcancer patients. Implications for the use of this information including theeffect on prognosis might help to identify patients most likely to benefit from aneoepitope-based therapy approach.DOI: 10.1159/000486949 PMCID: PMC6016056 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29950961
