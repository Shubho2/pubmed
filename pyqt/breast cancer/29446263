These tumors are grown viainjection of E0771 breast adenocarcinoma cells into the flank of mice maintained on high-fat diet. Within 1Â h of excision, the tumor and adjacent tissues areimaged using a pulsed THz system in the reflection mode. The THz images areclassified using a statistical Bayesian mixture model with unsupervised andsupervised approaches. Correlation with digitized pathology images is conductedusing classification images assigned by a modal class decision rule. Thecorresponding receiver operating characteristic curves are obtained based on the classification results. A total of 13 tumor samples obtained from 9 tumors areinvestigated. The results show good correlation of THz images with pathologyresults in all samples of cancer and fat tissues. For tumor samples of cancer,fat, and muscle tissues, THz images show reasonable correlation with pathologywhere the primary challenge lies in the overlapping dielectric properties ofcancer and muscle tissues. The use of a supervised regression approach showsimprovement in the classification images although not consistently in all tissue regions. Advancing THz imaging of breast tumors from mice and the development of accurate statistical models will ultimately progress the technique for theassessment of human breast tumor margins.(2018) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).DOI: 10.1117/1.JBO.23.2.026004 PMCID: PMC5812433 [Available on 2019-02-14]PMID: 29446263
