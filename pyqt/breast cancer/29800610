The results from MTT assay showed that DCME inhibits the growth of the cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner and upon the cell growthinhibition propolis extract provoked apoptotic changes in the cell nuclei. Adetailed chemical investigation of DCME led to the isolation of four newcycloartane triterpenes (1-4), along with 17 known compounds (5-21). Thestructures of the new compounds were elucidated by means of extensive analysis oftheir spectroscopic data and comparison with those reported for their analogues. In vitro antimicrobial activity of new compounds (1-4) along with the DCMEagainst four human pathogens was evaluated. All tested constituents exceptcompound 2 were highly active against Escherichia coli with MIC 64 μg/ml.Compound 1 exhibited high antifungal activity against Candida albicans withpotency close to that of the positive control (amphotericin B). The DCME showedvery good antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. This is the first study on propolis from Pitcairn Island.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.fitote.2018.05.024 PMID: 29800610  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
