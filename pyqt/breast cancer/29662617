Our aim was to investigate biomarkers of ovarian aging in a cohort of young healthy carriers of the BRCA mutation. We hypothesized that the roleplayed by BRCA genes in aging pathways is not exclusive to the ovary.Experimental Design: Healthy female BRCA carriers, 40 years or younger andhealthy male BRCA carriers, 50 years or younger, were enrolled in the study.Serum anti-mullerian Hormone (AMH), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), Klotho and IL-1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Ovarian AMH and protein kinase B (AKT) mRNA from BRCA carriers who underwent prophylacticoophorectomy and from age-matched, healthy, non-carriers who underwent partialoophorectomy due to benign conditions were analyzed by qPCR.Results: Thirty-three female (median age 35y) and 20 male (44y) BRCA carrierswere enrolled into the study and matched to control non-carriers (34y and 43y,respectively). Serum AMH level was significantly lower in BRCA female carriersthan in both non-carrier controls and age-matched nomograms. The levels ofovarian AMH and AKT mRNA were significantly lower in carriers than in controls.The systemic aging cytokines FGF-23, klotho and IL-1 displayed a differentialexpression in carriers of both genders. FGF-23 level was higher in carriers(P=0.06).Conclusions: Our results suggest a link between BRCA mutation, acceleratedovarian aging and systemic aging-related pathophysiology.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24638 PMCID: PMC5882308PMID: 29662617
