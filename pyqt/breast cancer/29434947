In the present study, theassociation between inflammation and BCSC phenotype was evaluated in human breastcancer tissue. Immunohistochemical staining for cluster of differentiation(CD)24, 44, 4, 8 and 68 was performed using tissue microarray blocks containing47 consecutive cases of invasive breast carcinoma and 10 normal breast tissuesamples. The levels of inflammatory modulators and cytokines, and intratumoral orperitumoral lymphocyte infiltration, were assessed. BCSCs were defined asCD44+/CD24- tumor cells. In total, 21.3% of samples exhibited the CD44+/CD24-phenotype. This phenotype was identified to be significantly inversely associatedwith lymph node metastasis. In addition, the CD44+/CD24- phenotype wassignificantly associated with the molecular subtype of breast cancer, and wasparticularly increased in the basal-like subtype. Furthermore, the CD44+/CD24-phenotype was significantly associated with intratumoral inflammation andtumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cell counts. Notably, tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cellswere significantly increased in patients with the basal-like molecular subtype ofbreast cancer. In conclusion, the present study identified a significantassociation between inflammation and the CD44+/CD24- phenotype in breast cancer. These results suggest that the interaction between inflammation and CSCs mayaffect the tumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer. Further studies arerequired to clarify the role of inflammation and CSCs in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7607 PMCID: PMC5777276PMID: 29434947
