In thecurrent study, we sought to evaluate patient perspectives regarding decisionmaking about RT.METHODS: Women aged 65 to 79 years with AJCC 7th edition stage I and II breastcancer who were reported to the Georgia and Los Angeles County Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End Results registries were surveyed (response rate, 70%)regarding RT decisions, the rationale for omitting RT, decision-making values,and understanding of disease recurrence risk. We also surveyed theircorresponding surgeons (response rate, 77%). Patient characteristics associatedwith the omission of RT were evaluated using multilevel, multivariable logisticregression, accounting for patient clustering within surgeons.RESULTS: Of 999 patients, 135 omitted RT (14%). Older age, lower tumor grade, andhaving estrogen receptor-positive disease each were found to be stronglyassociated with omission of RT in multivariable analyses, whereas the number ofcomorbidities was not. Non-English speakers were more likely to omit RT (adjustedodds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-24.5). The most commonly reportedreasons for RT omission were that a physician advised the patient that it was notneeded (54% of patients who omitted RT) and patient choice (41%). Risk of localdisease recurrence was overestimated by all patients: by approximately 2-foldamong those who omitted RT and by approximately 8-fold among those who receivedRT. The risk of distant disease recurrence was overestimated by approximately3-fold on average.CONCLUSIONS: To some extent, decisions regarding RT omission are appropriatelyinfluenced by patient age, tumor grade, and estrogen receptor status, but do not appear to be optimally tailored according to competing comorbidities. Many women who are candidates for RT omission overestimate their risk of disease recurrence.Cancer 2018;124:2714-2723. © 2018 American Cancer Society.© 2018 American Cancer Society.DOI: 10.1002/cncr.31378 PMID: 29669187
