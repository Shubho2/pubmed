This studyidentified the current combination IO drug clinical trials and investigated howtumour molecular profiling can help rationalise IO drug combinations.METHODS: IO targets were identified via PubMed search and expert opinion. IOdrugs were compiled by searching the National Cancer Institute Drug Dictionaryand pharmaceutical pipelines, August 2016. Combination IO trials were obtained bysearching doublet IO drug combinations in www.clinicaltrials.gov from Septemberto November 2016. IO target gene expressions were extracted from The CancerGenome Atlas (TCGA) data set and compared with normal tissues from theGenotype-Tissue Expression database. Differentially expressed genes for eachcancer were determined using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and p-values werecorrected for multiple testing.RESULTS: In total, 178 IO targets were identified; 90 targets have eitherregulatory approved or investigational therapeutics. In total, 410 combinationtrials involving ≥2 IO drugs were identified: skin (n = 102) and genitourinary(n = 41) malignancies have the largest number of combination IO trials; 109trials involved >2 disease sites. Summative patient accrual estimates among alltrials are 71,345. Trials combining cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) withprogrammed cell death protein 1 (n = 79) and CTLA4 with programmed cell deathligand 1 (n = 44) are the most common. Gene expression data from TCGA were mined to extract the 178 IO targets in 9089 tumours originating from 19 cancer types.IO target expression-clustered heatmap analysis identified several promising drugcombinations.CONCLUSION: Our review highlights the great interest in combination IO clinicaltrials. Our analysis can enrich IO combination therapy selection.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejca.2018.02.027 PMID: 29631102
