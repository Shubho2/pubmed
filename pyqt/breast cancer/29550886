Their novel4-thiophenyl-phthalonitriles precursors 3(a-c) were synthesized from theirsubstituted thiophenols 2(a-c). They were screened for their in-vitro antitumoractivity on Human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7)and hepatocellular carcinoma in comparison with healthy normal cells (humanfibroblast cells). Preliminary study of the structure-activity relationshipshowed that electronic factors in the trifluoromethyl moiety that attached to theZnPc skeleton had a magnificent effect on the antitumor activity of the newlysynthesized (RS)4ZnPcs 4a-c. More interestingly, the ZnPc 4c showed promisinganticancer activity against the tested human cancer cell lines. The detailedsynthesis, characterization and biological screening data were reported.DOI: 10.1007/s11274-018-2422-y PMID: 29550886  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
