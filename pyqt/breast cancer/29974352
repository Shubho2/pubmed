This study aimed to determine the clinical significanceand biological functions of lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 in breast cancer.METHODS: The expression of AFAP1-AS1 in breast cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue from 160 patients and breast cancer cell lines were determined by qRT-PCR.The clinical characteristics of patients were collected to analyse thecorrelation between AFAP1-AS1 expression and malignancy status. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze whether AFAP1-AS1 expression impacted prognosis. To assess the effect of AFAP1-AS1 on MCF-7 cellsproliferation, cell viability, EdU incorporation and colony formation assays wereconducted after AFAP1-AS1 knockdown by siRNA. The apoptosis was detected byCaspase-3 activity, cell cycle analysis, Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression. Wound scratch assay and EMT-related protein expression (E-cadherin, N-cadherin andVimentin) were conducted to evaluate the metastasis ability. To further determinethe effect of AFAP1-AS1 on AFAP1, the mRNA and protein expression of AFAP1 andsubsequent actin filament integrity were measured after AFAP1-AS1 knockdown.RESULTS: The expression of AFAP1-AS1 was up-regulated in human breast cancertissue and associated with malignancy status, high expression of AFAP1-AS1 had a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. AFAP1-AS1 expression was up-regulatedin 4 breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SK-RB-3, MDA-MB-231and MDA-MB-468) comparedwith normal breast cell line HBL-100. MCF-7, the most up-regulation cancer cell, was used for following studies. AFAP1-AS1 knockdown can inhibit theproliferation, metastasis and promote apoptosis of MCF-7. However, the AFAP1expression and actin filament integrity was not affected after AFAP1-AS1knockdown.CONCLUSION: Up-regulated lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 indicates a poor prognosis in breastcancer patients and regulated the breast cancer cells proliferation, apoptosisand metastasis.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0891-3 PMID: 29974352
