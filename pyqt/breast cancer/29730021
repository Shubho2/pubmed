[Epub ahead of print]Obesity and breast cancer in premenopausal women: Current evidence and futureperspectives.Laudisio D(1), Muscogiuri G(1), Barrea L(1), Savastano S(1), Colao A(2).Author information: (1)Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University "Federico II", Naples,Italy.(2)Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, University "Federico II", Naples,Italy. Electronic address: colao@unina.it.There is raising evidence reporting an increased incidence of breast cancer over the past decades. Every year approximately 1.4 million new cases of breast cancerare diagnosed worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 450,000/year. Outof these cases, 6.6% are diagnosed in premenopausal women with a median age atdiagnosis of 40 years: in premenopausal women breast cancer seems to be moreaggressive than in post-menopausal women. Obesity has been reported to increasethe risk of developing breast cancer and to worsen the prognosis. This seems tobe due to several obesity-related mechanisms. Insulin resistance that oftenoccurs with obesity may results in compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Insulincross-binds insulin-like growth factor-I receptors expressed on breast cells,resulting in proliferative stimuli on breast cancer cells. Besides,hyperinsulinemia up-regulates the growth hormone receptor (GHR) thus increasingGHR stimulation and resulting in an increased hepatic IGF-I synthesis. Moreover, insulin decreases the hepatic expression of binding proteins of IGF-I, such asinsulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP)-1 and IGFBP-2, thus leadingto high circulating and bioavailable free IGF-I. Additionally, obesity isassociated to chronic low-grade inflammation that has been reported to be anadditional stimulus for tumor growth. This review shows the current evidenceregarding to the association of obesity and breast cancer in premenopausal state focusing on both human and basic studies; showing that the obesity is a riskfactor for breast cancer also among premenopausal women, especially for themolecular subtype Triple Negative Breast Cancer.Copyright © 2018.
