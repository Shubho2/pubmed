However, it remains controversial onwhether aspirin use decreases the risk of cancers risks. Therefore, we conducted an updated meta-analysis to assess the associations between aspirin use andcancers.METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematicallysearched up to March 2017 to identify relevant studies. Relative risks (RRs) with95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations.RESULTS: A total of 218 studies with 309 reports were eligible for thismeta-analysis. Aspirin use was associated with a significant decrease in the riskof overall cancer (RR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.87-0.91), and gastric (RR = 0.75, 95% CI:0.65-0.86), esophageal (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62-0.89), colorectal (RR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.74-0.85), pancreatic (RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.68-0.93), ovarian (RR = 0.89,95% CI: 0.83-0.95), endometrial (RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85-0.99), breast(RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88-0.96), and prostate (RR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.99)cancers, as well as small intestine neuroendocrine tumors (RR = 0.17, 95% CI:0.05-0.58).CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that aspirin use is associated with a reducedrisk of gastric, esophageal, colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, endometrial,breast, and prostate cancers, and small intestine neuroendocrine tumors.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4156-5 PMCID: PMC5851082PMID: 29534696
