LUBAC has been demonstrated to be composed ofRBCK1, RNF31 and SHARPIN. The aim of this study was to explore all members of theLUBAC complex as novel biomarkers in breast cancer. We have already reported thatRNF31 mRNA levels are higher in breast cancer samples compared to adjacentnon-tumor tissue. In this study we extend these findings by demonstrating thatthe mRNA levels of RBCK1 and SHARPIN are also higher in tumors compared toadjacent non-tumor tissue in the same cross sectional study of samples (p <0.001). In addition, up-regulated mRNA expression of all three members of theLUBAC complex displayed high predictive value in distinguishing tumor tissuesfrom adjacent non-tumor tissue as determined by ROC curve analysis. Furthermore, we investigated whether there is an association between the mRNA and proteinexpression levels of RBCK1, RNF31 and SHARPIN and clinicopathological parameters including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) status and found that RNF31 protein issignificantly higher in ERalpha-negative tumors than ERalpha-positive tumors (p =0.034). Collectively, our findings indicate that up-regulated mRNA expression of RNF31, RBCK1 and SHARPIN could potentially be diagnostic biomarkers of breastcancer and RNF31 might be a drug target for ERalpha-negative breast cancers.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197183 PMCID: PMC5953448PMID: 29763465  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
