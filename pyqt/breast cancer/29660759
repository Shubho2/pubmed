BRCA-mutant cancer cells have abnormal homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA. In these tumors, the base excision repair (BER) pathway isimportant for cell survival. The poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase(PARP) enzymes play a key role in BER, and PARP inhibitors are effective incausing cell death in BRCA-mutant cells while sparing normal cells-a conceptcalled synthetic lethality. PARP inhibitors are the first cancer therapeuticsdesigned to exploit synthetic lethality. Recent clinical trials in BRCA-mutant,metastatic breast cancer demonstrated improved outcomes with single-agent PARPinhibitors (olaparib and talazoparib) over chemotherapy. However, resistance toPARP inhibitors remains a challenge. Primarily due to myelosuppression, thecombination of PARP inhibitors with chemotherapy has been difficult. Novelcombinations with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and other targeted therapies arebeing pursued. In this review, the authors discuss current knowledge of PARPinhibitors in BRCA-mutant breast cancer and potential future directions for theseagents.
