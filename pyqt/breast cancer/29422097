It is unclear, however, how BCS followed byre-excision is associated with all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality,and whether the BCS survival advantage is maintained if re-excision is needed.The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical, patient, provider andgeographic variation associated with receipt of re-excision surgery, and toexamine the relationship between re-excision and all-cause and breastcancer-specific mortality.METHODS: All women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer in Alberta, Canadafrom 2002 to 2009 were identified from the Alberta Cancer Registry, of which11,626 were eligible for study inclusion. Type of first breast cancer surgeryafter diagnosis, subsequent re-excisions within 1 year, surgeon (anonymized), andhospital were obtained from provincial physician claims data. Multilevel logisticregression with surgeons and hospitals as crossed random effects was used toestimate the adjusted odds ratios of re-excision by the factors of interest.Poisson regression models were fitted to compare all-cause and breastcancer-specific mortality by surgical pattern.RESULTS: Re-excision surgery was received by 19% (N = 5659) of patients whoinitially received BCS. The adjusted odds of re-excision varied significantly by geography of surgery, and by individual surgeon among stage I and II patientsbeyond the variation explained by the factors investigated (Stage I OR standarddeviation (SD) = 0.43; stage II OR SD = 0.39). Patients who were treated with BCSplus re-excision surgery with either mastectomy or further BCS had similarall-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality as those treated with BCS without re-excision.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that breast cancer patients who are treatedwith BCS plus re-excision surgery by either mastectomy or further BCS havesimilar survival as those treated with BCS without re-excision. The significantvariation in the likelihood of re-excision by geography and by individual surgeonis concerning, especially given the costs to the patient associated withadditional surgery and the financial costs to the health system.DOI: 10.1186/s12913-018-2882-7 PMCID: PMC5806481PMID: 29422097
