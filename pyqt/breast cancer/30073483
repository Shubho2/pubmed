The present work aims to evaluate the acceptance of CAM inthe whole radiation oncology community.METHODS: We conducted an online survey on CAM and sent the modified questionnairethat was successfully distributed to all members of the Research Group onGynecological Oncology (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie, AGO) of theDKG in 2014 to the members of the German Society of Radiation Oncology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Radioonkologie und Strahlentherapie, DEGRO). The surveyconsisted of 17 questions regarding personal information and current CAMguidelines within the workplace/clinic.RESULTS: A total of 143 members participated. Of these, 12% had some CAMqualification. For hematological cancer in 35% and in up to 76% for breastcancer, CAM treatment is offered in German radiation oncology facilities, mainly due to fatigue symptoms. CAM is part of routine treatment in 32.2%, 22.0% areplanning to incorporate it. Most physicians advise patients to partake in sports activities and recommend dietary supplements and nutritional counseling. The costof CAM treatment is fully covered in 9.8% of all participating facilities.CONCLUSION: Today, CAM is integrated into cancer care; however, skepticismregarding its effect still exists. Evidence-based results must be generated toconvince physicians of the effectiveness of CAM methods. CAM qualifications must be included in physicians' training to improve their understanding and counselingregarding CAM options in cancer care.DOI: 10.1007/s00066-018-1345-8 PMID: 30073483
