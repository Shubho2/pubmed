A total of 65 patients with breast cancer were examined 1 year after initial treatment and another year follow-up. Questionnaires addressed meaning inlife (MLQ), anxiety and depression (HADS), satisfaction with life (SWLS),health-related quality of life (EQ-5D, EORTC) and post-traumatic growth (PTGI).Personal meaning systems were assessed using a qualitative method. In thepersonal meaning systems with well-being and relationships as the most frequentlynamed meaning categories, the experienced gains far outweigh the losses sustainedas a result of the disease. A stronger sense of meaning was related to lowerlevels of anxiety and depression, a higher level of satisfaction with life andbetter health-related functioning. Well-being and post-traumatic growth weremostly independent. Reported losses were strongly related to a poorer well-being.Cancer can induce a process of personal growth, and a strong sense of purposecould facilitate psychological adjustment. The often claimed correlation ofpost-traumatic growth and a better psychological adjustment is still lackingclear evidence, whereas losses proofed to be crucial.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ecc.12841 PMID: 29575157
