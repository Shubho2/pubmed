However, these nanomedicines are of interest only if they efficiently target diseased cells and accumulate in tumors.Here we report the synthesis of a new generation of immunotargeted nanomedicines composed of a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) core,polyethylene glycol coating and the anti-HER2 single chain fragment variable(scFv) of Trastuzumab antibody. We developed two novel bioengineered scFvcarrying two cysteines located (i) at the end (4D5.1-cys2) or (ii) at thebeginning (4D5.2-cys2) of its hexahistidine tag. The scFv bioconjugation wascontrolled via heterobifunctional linkers including a second generation maleimide(SGM). Our data indicated that the insertion of cysteines at the beginning of thehexahistidine tag was allowed to obtain nearly 2-fold conjugation efficiency (13 scFv/NP) compared to NMs using classical maleimide. As a result, the NMs-4D5.2built using the optimal 4D5-cys2 and linkers equipped with SGM showed theenhanced recognition of HER2 in an ELISA format and on the surface of SK-BR-3breast cancer cells in vitro. Their stability in serum was also significantlyimproved compared to the NMs-4D5. Our results showed the fundamental importanceof the controlled ligand conjugation in the perspective of rational design of NMswith tailored physicochemical and biological properties.DOI: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00091 PMID: 29553717
