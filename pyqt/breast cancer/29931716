[Epub ahead of print]Fullerene as a doxorubicin nanotransporter for targeted breast cancer therapy:Capillary electrophoresis analysis.Kepinska M(1), Kizek R(1)(2), Milnerowicz H(1).Author information: (1)Department of Biomedical and Environmental Analyses, Faculty of Pharmacy with Division of Laboratory Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.(2)Central Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary andPharmaceutical Sciences Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.The clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) is limited by dose-related cardiomyopathy, which becomes more prevalent with increasing cumulative doses of the drug.Complexes of fullerene with DOX were designed and studied using biophysicalmethods. The ability of DOX to release from fullerene at different pHs wasanalyzed. It has been shown that the size of the fullerene-DOX complexes was ∼280nm. The zeta potential for fullerene was -30 mV, for DOX -8 mV, and forfullerene-DOX conjugates -24 mV. Drug release was studied by CE with LIFdetection. When fullerene-DOX conjugates were separated in a pH 7.5 buffer, 43%of all DOX signals were derived from free DOX, with the signal increasing as pHdecreased. At pH 5.25, all DOX had been released and 100% of the signal wasderived from free DOX. The release of DOX from complexes with fullerene at lower pH can be used in targeted antineoplastic therapy, resulting in lower toxicityfor less acidic non-target tissue.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
