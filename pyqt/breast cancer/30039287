PARPs are involved in the basic mechanisms of DNArepair. PARP3, a critical player for efficient mitotic progression, is requiredfor the stabilization of the mitotic spindle by regulation of the mitoticcomponents, NuMA and Tankyrase 1.METHODS: The sensitization effect of vinorelbine on PARP3 inhibition-inducedcytotoxicity was assessed by the SRB assay. The contribution of programed celldeath and cell cycle arrest to the sensitization effect were determined byassessing changes in Annexin V, a marker of apoptosis. Alterations in cell cycle progression were assessed by cell cycle analysis. We used immunofluorescence toassess the effect of vinorelbine and/or PARP3 inhibitors on tubulin andmicrotubule depolarization. The PARP3 chemiluminescent assay kit was used forPARP3 activity.RESULTS: PARP3 inhibitors sensitize breast cancer cells to vinorelbine, a vincaalkaloid used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Olaparib which wasoriginally described as a PARP1 and 2 inhibitor has recently been shown to be apotent PARP3 inhibitor while ME0328 is a more selective PARP3 inhibitor. Thecombination of vinorelbine with nontoxic concentrations of ME0328 or olaparibreduces vinorelbine resistance by 10 and 17 fold, respectively, potentiatingvinorelbine-induced arrest at the G2/M boundary. In addition, PARP3 inhibitionpotentiates vinorelbine interaction with tubulin. Furthermore, olaparib or ME0328potentiates vinorelbine-induced PARP3 inhibition, mitotic arrest, and apoptosis.CONCLUSION: Our results indicated this approach with PARP3 inhibitors andvinorelbine is unique and promising for breast cancer patients with metastases.This combination could significantly increase the survival of breast cancerpatients with metastases.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4888-6 PMID: 30039287
