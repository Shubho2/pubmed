Five ER/PR/HER2 phenotypes were classified. Kaplan-Meier method and Coxproportional hazards model were used to examine the survival differences amongthese subtypes.RESULTS: Of the 6,875 eligible women, 4,274 (62.2%) were classified as Luminal A,836 (12.2%) as Luminal B HER2-, 605 (8.8%) as Luminal B HER2+, 401 (5.8%) asHER2+ non-Luminal and 759 (11.0%) as Triple Negative. MƒÅori and Pacific womenwere less likely to have Triple Negative disease, while Pacific women were morelikely to be HER2+ non-Luminal. The five-year breast cancer-specific survival wasworst for HER2+ non-Luminal (80.1%) and Triple Negative (81.9%), followed byLuminal B HER2- (89.3%) and Luminal B HER2+ (91.6%), and was the best for LuminalA (96.8%). The adjusted breast cancer-specific mortality hazard ratio for Triple Negative and HER2+ non-Luminal compared to Luminal A was 4.91 (95% CI: 3.86-6.26)and 3.94 (95% CI: 2.94-5.30), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of phenotype in women with Stage I-III breast cancer is similar to the overseas cohorts. Most New Zealand women with Luminal A breastcancer have a very good prognosis, but the less common subtypes have relativelypoor outcomes.PMID: 29771902
