New York, NY.INTRODUCTION: Flap-based breast reconstruction demands greater operative laborand offers superior patient reported outcomes compared to implants. However,implants continue to outpace flaps, with some suggesting inadequate remuneration as one barrier. This study aims to characterize market variation in the ratio of implants to flaps and assess correlation with physician payments.METHODS: Using the Blue Health Intelligence database from 2009-2013, patientswere identified who received tissue expander (i.e. implant) or free-flap breastreconstruction. The ratio of implants/flaps and physician payments was assessedusing quadratic modeling. Matched bootstrapped samples from the early and lateperiods generated probability distributions, approximating the odds of surgeonsswitching reconstructive method.RESULTS: 21,259 episodes of breast reconstruction occurred within 122 U.S.markets. The distribution of implant/flap ratio varied by market, ranging from 5 percentile at 1.63 to 95 percentile at 43.7 (median 6.19). Modeling theimplant/flap ratio vs. implant payment showed a more elastic quadratic equation(f(x)=0.955x + 2.766x) compared to the function for flap/implant ratio vs. flappayment (f(x)=-0.061x + 0.734x). Probability modeling demonstrated that switchingthe reconstructive method from implants to flaps with 0.75 probability required a$1,610 payment increase, while switching from flaps to implants at the samecertainty occurred at a loss of $960.CONCLUSION: There was a correlation between the ratio of flaps/implants andphysician reimbursement by market. Switching from implants to flaps requiredlarge surgeon payment increases. Despite a revenue value unit schedule over twiceas high for flaps, current flap reimbursements do not appear commensurate withphysician effort.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004727 PMID: 29979366
