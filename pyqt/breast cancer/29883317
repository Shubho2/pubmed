Malignancies of the GI system are responsible for nearly 30% of cancer-related morbidity andapproximately 40% of cancer-related mortality, worldwide. For this reason, thediscovery of novel prognostic biomarkers that can efficiently provide a betterprognosis, risk assessment and prediction of treatment response is an imperative need. Human kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are a subgroup of trypsin andchymotrypsin-like serine peptidases that have emerged as promisingprognosticators for many human types of cancer, being aberrantly expressed incancerous tissues. The aberrant expression of KLKs in human malignancies is oftenregulated by KLK/microRNAs (miRNAs) interactions, as many miRNAs have been found to target KLKs and therefore alter their expression levels. The biomarker utilityof KLKs has been elucidated not only in endocrine-related human malignancies,including those of the prostate and breast, but also in GI malignancies. The mainpurpose of this review is to summarize the existing information regarding theprognostic significance of KLKs in major types of GI malignancies and highlightthe regulatory role of miRNAs on the expression levels of KLKs in these types of cancer.DOI: 10.1515/hsz-2017-0342 PMID: 29883317
