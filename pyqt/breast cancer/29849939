One major mediator of breast cancer involves chronicinflammation. M1 macrophages are an integral component of chronic inflammationand the breast cancer tumor microenvironment (TME). Previous studies havedemonstrated that up to 50% of the breast tumor comprise of tumor-associatedmacrophages (TAMs) and increased TAM infiltration has been associated with poorpatient prognosis. Furthermore, breast cancer associated deaths are predominantlyattributed to invasive cancers and metastasis with epithelial-mesenchymaltransition (EMT) being implicated. In this study, we investigated the effects of cellular crosstalk between TAMs and breast cancer using an in vitro model system.M1 polarized THP-1 macrophage conditioned media (CM) was generated and used toevaluate cellular and functional changes of breast cancer lines T47D and MCF-7.We observed that T47D and MCF-7 exhibited a partial EMT phenotype in the presenceof activated THP-1 CM. Additionally, MCF-7 displayed a significant increase inmigratory and invasive properties. We conclude that M1 secretory factors canpromote a partial EMT of epithelial-like breast cancer cells. The targeting of M1macrophages or their secretory components may inhibit EMT and limit the invasive potential of breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24917 PMCID: PMC5966261PMID: 29849939
