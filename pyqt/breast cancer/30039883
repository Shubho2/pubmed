[Epub aheadof print]Investigation of the relationship among fatigue, self-efficacy and quality oflife during chemotherapy in patients with breast, lung or gastrointestinalcancer.Akin S(1), Kas Guner C(2).Author information: (1)Faculty of Nursing, University of Health Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.(2)Taskopru Vocational High School, Kastamonu University, Taskopru, Kastamonu,Turkey.To explore the relationship between fatigue and self-efficacy, and quality oflife (QoL) during chemotherapy of patients with breast, lung or gastrointestinal cancers. This study is a descriptive-correlational research. The study populationcomprised of patients with breast, lung and gastrointestinal cancer treated atthe outpatient chemotherapy unit. Patients' self-efficacy and QoL were assessedusing Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale andStrategies Used by Patients to Promote Health scale. The sample included 236patients receiving chemotherapy for lung cancer (30.9%), gastrointestinal (25.8%)or breast cancers (25.4%). The patients had little confidence in performingself-care self-efficacy during chemotherapy for the management of illness andchemotherapy-related side effects. The study found that the patients with cancer were moderately fatigued and all the domains of QoL of patients with cancerundergoing chemotherapy were considerably impaired. Positive correlations werefound between self-efficacy scores and fatigue scores (p < 0.001), and QoL scores(p < 0.001). Better self-efficacy beliefs were associated with better QoL andlower fatigue. Improving the cancer patients' self-confidence in performingself-care behaviours may have a positive impact on performing cognitive andbehavioural fatigue management strategies and can influence positively thepatients' QoL during chemotherapy.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ecc.12898 PMID: 30039883
