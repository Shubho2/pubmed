In Pakistan,one in every nine women develops breast cancer some time in her life. This highincidence of breast cancer and the poor socioeconomic conditions of Pakistan makebreast self-examination (BSE) the best tool for the prevention and earlydiagnosis of breast cancer. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess theknowledge, attitude, and practice of BSE among female college students ofKarachi, Pakistan.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1000 students from June toDecember 2016. Data were collected using a pre-piloted questionnaire, and SPSS(version 20) was used for data analysis. Chi-square test was used to determinethe significance of the difference in knowledge and attitude among participantswho had performed BSE and those who had not. A P < 0.05 was consideredstatistically significant.RESULTS: The overall response rate was 90.9%. Although 71.4% of the women knewwhat BSE was, only 33.1% had performed it. Majority of the participantsconsidered that BSE is important in the early detection of breast cancer. With59.7% of the population having an adequate amount of knowledge, 87.2% had apositive attitude toward BSE. A medical background was found to be a significant predictor for adequate knowledge and a positive attitude toward BSE.CONCLUSION: Despite a positive attitude found among the population toward BSE,its knowledge and practice were inadequate. Educational interventions arerequired in Pakistan to encourage young women to perform BSE regularly so thatbreast abnormalities can be detected early on and mortalities can be minimized.DOI: 10.4103/jehp.jehp_147_17 PMCID: PMC6052780PMID: 30079361
