In this study, a population-based study of primarybreast DLBCL in the United States was performed to determine its incidencetrends, prognostic factors, survival, the role of surgery as well as thecomparison with nodal DLBCL. 1021 patients diagnosed with breast DLBCL wereidentified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancerregistries from 1973-2014. The incidence of both breast and nodal DLBCL increasedover time. Patients with breast DLBCL were older, mainly women, diagnosed atearlier stages and had lower prevalence in white and black races compared withnodal DLBCL. Multivariate analysis revealed older age (â‰¥ 70 years old) andadvanced stage as independent predictors of worse OS. Independent predictor ofbetter DSS were younger age (< 70 years old), early stage and diagnosis after2000. When analyzed according to age, stage, race, tumor laterality and year ofdiagnosis, the overall survival did not benefit from surgery except in patientsdiagnosed between 2001-2010 and the surgery rate decreased overtime. Comparedwith nodal DLBCL, breast DLBCL patients exhibited a better outcome. Inconclusion, breast DLBCL is a rare tumor with increasing incidence and improvedsurvival over the last four decades. The introduction of rituximab seems toimprove the outcome of breast DLBCL. Further studies are needed to advance ourunderstanding of breast DLBCL and optimize the treatment strategy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23285 PMCID: PMC5790514PMID: 29423097
