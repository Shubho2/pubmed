For both ethical andlegal reasons, we see the decision on whether to undertake a genetic screeningtest being increasingly seen, in future, as calling for a personalised analysisof the full range of subsequent management options. The conventional dissociationof 'risk assessment' and 'risk management' phases is thereby ruled out. One wayof addressing the resulting challenge is through personalised multi-criterialdecision support tools. In this vision paper we provide conceptual proof ofmethod of how such an interactive online tool could function. The polygeneticgenetic screening decision is used, solely as illustration.PMID: 29968592
