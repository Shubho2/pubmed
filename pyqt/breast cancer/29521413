We tested the hypothesis that abnormal production of ECM components leads to blood-released ECM molecules representing tumorcirculating biomarkers. Candidate genes were selected through class comparison intwo publicly available datasets and confirmed in paired normal and tumorassociated fibroblasts from breast carcinoma (BC) specimens. Production andrelease of ECM molecules were evaluated in normal human dermal fibroblasts(NHDFs) treated with conditioned media from three BC cell lines. Plasma samplesfrom healthy donors and from patients with malignant or benign breast diseasewere tested by ELISA for the presence of collagen 11a1 (COL11A1), collagenoligomeric matrix protein (COMP), and collagen 10a1 (COL10A1). Selected ECMmolecules were investigated by IHC in malignant and benign specimens. In silicoanalysis of gene expression profiles identified 11 ECM genes significantlyup-regulated in tumor versus normal tissue. Western blot analyses revealedincreased levels of molecules encoded by three of these genes, COL11A1, COMP, andCOL10A1, in cell lysates and supernatants of conditioned NHDFs. Class comparison and class prediction analyses of two independent series of human plasma samplesidentified the combination of COL11A1, COMP, and COL10A1 as potentiallyinformative in discriminating BC patients from those with benign disease. Thethree molecules resulted expressed in the stroma of BC tissue samples. Ourresults indicate that circulating COL11A1, COMP, and COL10A1 may be useful indiagnostic assessment of suspicious breast nodules and ECM molecules couldrepresent an avenue to biomarker identification.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26513 PMID: 29521413
