The aim of this study was todevelop a scoring system to estimate risk of death at 100 days in elderly cancer patients to assist the therapeutic decision.METHODS: This was a multicentric, prospective cohort study approved by an ethics committee. Elderly cancer patients aged older than 70 years were enrolled before the final therapeutic decision. A standardised CGA was made before the treatment decision at baseline. Within 100 days, event (death), oncologic and geriatricdata were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to select the riskfactors for the overall population. Score points were assigned to each riskfactor using the β coefficient. Internal validation was performed by a bootstrap method. Calibration was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit testand accuracy with the mean c-statistic.FINDINGS: One thousand fifty patients (mean age: 82 years) joined the study from April 2012 to December 2014. The independent predictors were metastatic cancers(odds ratio [OR] 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], [1.7-3.5] p<0 .001); gaitspeed<0.8 m/s (OR 2.1; 95% CI [1.3-3.3] p=0.001); Mini Nutritional Assessment(MNA) < 17 (OR 8; 95% CI; [3.7-17.3] p<0.001), MNA ≤23.5 and ≥ 17 (OR 4.4; 95%CI, [2.1-9.1) p<0.001); performance status (PS) > 2 (OR 1.7; 95% CI, [1.1-2.6)]p=0.015) and cancers other than breast cancer (OR 4; 95% CI, [2.1-7.9] p<0.001). We attributed 4 points for MNA<17, 3 points for MNA between ≤23.5 and ≥ 17, 2points for metastatic cancers, 1 point for gait speed <0.8 m/s, 1 point forPS > 2 and 3 points for cancers other than breast cancer. The risk of death at100 days was 4% for 0 to 6 points, 24% for 7 to 8 points, 39% for 9 to 10 points and 67% for 11 points.INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first score which estimates earlydeath in elderly cancer patients. The system could assist in the treatmentdecision for elderly cancer patients.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejca.2018.04.013 PMID: 30014882
