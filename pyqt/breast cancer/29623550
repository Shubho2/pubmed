Two RT treatment plannings were generated for each patient based on the initial CT simulation and tumor bed boost CT simulation to assess seroma and boost target volume (BTV) changes duringWBI. Also, dosimetric impact of ART was analyzed by comparative evaluation ofcritical organ doses in both RT treatment plannings.RESULTS: Median time interval between the two CT simulations was 35 days.Statistically significant reduction was detected in seroma volume and BTV during the conventionally fractionated WBI course along with statistically significantreduction in critical organ doses with ART (p < 0.0001).CONCLUSION: Our data suggest significant benefit of ART by use of replanning the tumor bed boost with repeated CT simulation after WBI for patients withclinically evident seroma.DOI: 10.1007/s11604-018-0735-2 PMID: 29623550
