A randomized controlled trial (RCT)is described that tested a culturally and linguistically tailored breast cancereducation program conducted among a racially/ethnically diverse sample of 209D/deaf women age 40 years or older. The study focused on D/deaf women with nomore than a secondary education, a population at relatively high risk forincomplete breast health knowledge and services. This population's inadequatebreast cancer knowledge and screening practices and the value of the educationprogram were confirmed. Knowledge increased from -baseline to 12-month follow-up in the intervention group, and in some instances the control group; increasedintention to get a mammogram was observed in the intervention group. Possiblereasons for the few significant intervention/control group differences at 12months were examined. Materials from the RCT are available online.DOI: 10.1353/aad.2018.0014 PMID: 30033435
