However, its effects on the fetus are not clearlyknown. To better guide its clinical use, we aimed to study the mechanismunderlying the placental transport of UDCA. The uptake and efflux of UDCA across placental apical membranes were studied using BeWo cells; effects of differentexposure durations, UDCA concentrations, temperatures, and inhibitors oftransporters were studied. A transwell assay was performed, and UDCAconcentration in both fetal and maternal sides was measured using LC-MS/MS.Higher unidirectional transport of UDCA was observed in the basolateral-to-apicaldirection than in the apical-to-basolateral direction. Ko143 and verapamil, whichare typical inhibitors of efflux transporters, significantly increased UDCAtransport from different directions. UDCA uptake from the apical membrane of BeWocells was time-dependent, but sodium-independent. It was inhibited by inhibitors of energy metabolism and of organic anion transporters, indicating an activetransport mechanism. UDCA uptake from the apical membranes of BeWo cells could bemediated by organic anion-transporting polypeptides, whereas its efflux could be mediated by breast cancer resistance protein and multidrug resistant protein 3.The results of the present study may provide a basis for UDCA use in pregnancy.This article is protected by copyright.
