[Epub ahead of print]Inhibition of tumor-microenvironment interaction and tumor invasion bysmall-molecule allosteric inhibitor of DDR2 extracellular domain.Grither WR(1)(2), Longmore GD(3)(4)(5).Author information: (1)Integrating Communication within the Cancer Environmental Institute,Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63110.(2)Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Washington University, St. Louis,MO 63110.(3)Integrating Communication within the Cancer Environmental Institute,Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63110; glongmore@wustl.edu.(4)Department of Medicine, Washington University, St. Louis, MO 63110.(5)Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Washington University, St. Louis,MO 63110.The action of the collagen binding receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) discoidindomain receptor 2 (DDR2) in both tumor and tumor stromal cells has beenestablished as critical for breast cancer metastasis. Small molecule inhibitorsthat target the extracellular domain of RTKs are rare, as they have classicallybeen regarded as too small to block binding with large polypeptide ligands. Here,we report the identification and characterization of a selective, extracellularlyacting small molecule inhibitor (WRG-28) of DDR2 that uniquely inhibitsreceptor-ligand interactions via allosteric modulation of the receptor. Bytargeting DDR2, WRG-28 inhibits tumor invasion and migration, as well astumor-supporting roles of the stroma, and inhibits metastatic breast tumor cellcolonization in the lungs. These findings represent an approach to inhibitingtumor-stromal interactions and support the development of allosteric inhibitorsof DDR2, such as WRG-28, as a promising approach to antimetastasis treatment.Copyright Â© 2018 the Author(s).
