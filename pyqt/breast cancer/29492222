Numerous studies have revealed the close association of caspase-3 expression and breastcancer. Nevertheless, the prognostic value of caspase-3 expression for patientswith breast cancer remains uncertain. To thoroughly analyze the prognostic effectof caspase-3 expression on the clinicopathological features and survival ofbreast cancer, we conducted this meta-analysis. With various search strategies,electronic databases were comprehensively searched. A total of 3091 patients from21 studies were ultimately obtained. The analysis results indicated thatincreased expression of caspase-3 had a negative influence on the overallsurvival (OS) of breast cancer (HR = 1.73, 95%CI 1.12-2.67, P = 0.014). Subgroup analyses based on race revealed that the value of caspase-3 for evaluatingpatients' OS was more useful in Asian patients (HR = 3.16, 95%CI 1.20-8.15, P =0.020), and subgroup analyses based on study analytical methods revealed thatcaspase-3 was a risk factor for breast cancer patients in multivariate overallsurvival analyses (HR = 1.67, 95%CI 1.02-2.75, P = 0.044). As for therelationship between caspase-3 expression and breast cancer subtype as well asprogression, caspase-3 might serve as a risk factor for the progestogen receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) subtypes (OR = 1.44,95%CI 1.09-1.89, P = 0.010; OR = 1.76, 95%CI 1.18-2.62, P = 0.050, respectively) of breast cancer. However, no evidence showed that increased expression ofcaspase-3 was statistically correlated with tumor differentiation state(low/moderate or high), tumor TNM stage (I-II/III-IV) or lymph node metastasis(-/+). In conclusion, this meta-analysis revealed that increased caspase-3expression was significantly associated with worse prognosis and two subtypes of breast cancer. More prospective studies are urgently needed to define theprognostic value of caspase-3 expression in patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23667 PMCID: PMC5823563PMID: 29492222
