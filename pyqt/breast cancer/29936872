[Epubahead of print]Atorvastatin-loaded lipid nanoparticles: antitumor activity studies on MCF-7breast cancer cells.Gambhire VM(1), Salunkhe SM(1), Gambhire MS(1).Author information: (1)a Sinhgad College of Pharmacy , Pune , Maharashtra , India.Atorvastatin is a synthetic statin commonly used in the treatment ofhypercholesterolemia. Apart from this, statins appear to have pleiotropiceffects, including modulation of cell growth, apoptosis. Through modulation ofthese pathways, statins have the potential to influence a wide range of diseaseprocesses, including cancer. However, poor aqueous solubility (0.1 mg/mL) andpoor oral bioavailability has limited therapeutic application of atorvastatin.Present work is an attempt to improve tumor targeting of atorvastatin byincorporating in nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and studying its anticanceractivity on MCF-7 cell lines. NLCs of atorvastatin were formulated by high-speed homogenization followed by probe sonication method. The optimized batch of NLCshad a mean size of 130.02 ± 3.1 nm and entrapment efficiency of 90.42 ± 3.7%. Thein vitro drug release study by dialysis method indicated that drug entrapped inthe NLCs remains entrapped at acidic pH as well as in phosphate buffer of pH 7.4 for a prolonged period of time as compared to plain drug. In vitro cytotoxicitystudies on MCF-7 (mammary adenocarcinoma human cell lines) cell lines showed thatconcentration of drug required for total growth inhibition (TGI) and 50% growthinhibition (GI50) of MCF-7 cells was found to be 27.4 µg/mL and <10 µg/mLrespectively, in case of atorvastatin- NLCs which is less than that required incase of plain atorvastatin and almost similar to that of adriamycin. All thesefindings reinforce the fact that atorvastatin loaded NLCs are promising noveldelivery system for treating breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/03639045.2018.1492605 PMID: 29936872
