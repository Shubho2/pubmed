The major active constituents of the extractwere tentatively identified by LC/MS which revealed the presence of phenoliccompound derivatives and saponin that may be responsible in part for the activityof the extract. The emphasis was laid on the main apoptotic pathways as well asthe extract effect on the normal cell line. Results of phytochemicalinvestigation, cell cycle analysis, and molecular analysis of apoptotic andproliferative markers have shown effective anticancer activity against MCF-7,BT-474, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines which represent three subtypes of breastcancer, luminal A, luminal B, and triple negative, respectively. On the otherhand, the effects on normal lung fibroblast cell line are less prominent at thedose used for treating breast cancer cell lines.Â© 2018 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.DOI: 10.1002/cbdv.201800045 PMID: 29874411
