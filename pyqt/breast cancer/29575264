This study explored this pathway by examining the associationbetween attachment insecurity and quality of life in women with breast cancer,and by exploring the mediating role of two avoidant emotion processes in thisassociation. Women with breast cancer (N = 155) completed measures of attachment,emotional suppression, emotional awareness and quality of life. Avoidance ofattachment was positively associated with emotional suppression (β = .29,p < .01) and lack of emotional awareness (β = .27, p < .01), and negativelyassociated with quality of life (β = -.22, p < .05). Lack of emotional awareness partially mediated the relationship between attachment avoidance and quality oflife (indirect effect β = -.12, p = .008). Attachment anxiety was not associated with any variable. Attachment avoidance may hinder the process of adaptation tobreast cancer and difficulties in identifying and describing emotions may bepartly responsible for this influence. Access to and ability to benefit fromsocial and medical supports is likely to depend on being able to engage withothers and recognise and process emotions effectively. Research and clinicalimplications are discussed.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ecc.12830 PMID: 29575264
