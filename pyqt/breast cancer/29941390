Our objective wasto correlate BRCAness with the clinicopathologic features, including a familyhistory (FH) of cancer, in breast cancer patients with a high risk of BRCAmutations.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study included 124 patients, including 55 with early-onset and 77 with triple-negative breast cancer, who had undergoneresection at Kyushu University Hospital from 2005 to 2014. Early-onset breastcancer is defined as an onset in patients aged ≤ 40 years. BRCAness was performedusing multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. The patients' FH of cancerwas surveyed from first- to third-degree relatives.RESULTS: Of the 124 patients, the multiple ligation-dependent probe amplificationassay results indicated that 59 tumors (47.6%) had BRCAness and 27 patients(21.8%) had a positive FH for cancer. The patients with BRCAness experiencedsignificantly shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS)compared with those without. Patients with FH had shorter RFS and OS compared to those without BRCAness. The patients were divided into those with and withoutBRCAness and those with and without a positive FH. The BRCAness with FH subgroup experienced significantly shorter RFS and OS. Multivariate analysis revealed thatBRCAness and a positive FH were independent negative prognostic factors.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that BRCAness tumors with a positive FH ofcancer were associated with a poor prognosis in the BRCA-mutation high-riskgroup. We propose that BRCAness and a positive FH will serve to predict patients'prognosis.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
