[Epubahead of print]Augmented Anticancer Activity of Naringenin-loaded TPGS Polymeric Nanosuspension for Drug Resistive MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cells.Rajamani S(1), Radhakrishnan A(2), Sengodan T(1), Thangavelu S(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Biotechnology , Nandha college of pharmacy and researchInstitute , Erode-52 , Tamilnadu , India.(2)b Department of Pharmaceutics , JSS College of Pharmacy , Ootacamund , JSSAcademy of Higher Education & Research , Mysuru , India.Naringenin (NAR) is a naturally occurring plant flavonoid, found predominantly incitrus fruits, possesses a wide range of pharmacological properties. However,despite the therapeutic potential of NAR, its clinical development has beenhindered due to low aqueous solubility and inefficient transport acrossbiological membranes resulting in low bioavailability at tumor sites. In ourprevious studies, nanosuspension of naringenin (NARNS) was prepared using highpressure homogenization method using different polymers. D-Î±-Tocopherylpolyethylene glycol succinate 1000 (TPGS) was added as a co-stabilizer. Allformulation characterization studies were performed. As a continuation of ourprevious research, current study has further evaluated the ability of theTPGS-coated NARNS, to reverse drug-resistance of P-gp-over expressing MCF-7 humanbreast adenocarcinoma cell line and animal model. MTT-based colorimetric assayrevealed higher cytotoxic efficacy of NARNS than free NAR in MCF-7 cells. NARNStreatment significantly increased intracellular ROS level, mitochondrial membranepotential, caspase-3 activity, lipid peroxidation status (TBARS) and decreasedGSH levels when compared to free NAR treatment in MCF-7 cells. It has been alsonoticed that the presence of apoptotic indices (membrane blebbing, nuclearfragmentation) in NARNS treated cancer cells. Further, NARNS exhibiteddose-dependent in-vitro anti-tumor activity with DLA cells. A significantincrease in the life span and a decrease in the cancer cell number & tumor weightwere noted in the tumor-induced mice after treatment with NARNS.DOI: 10.1080/03639045.2018.1496445 PMID: 29968480
