However, it is increasingly clear that this is nota good predictor of the response of breast cancer cells to the anti-proliferativeeffect of PI3K inhibitors, indicating that isoform(s) other than p110α maymodulate cancer cells sensitivity to PI3K inhibition. Surprisingly, we found thatalthough no mutations in the p110δ subunit have been detected thus far in breast cancer, the expression of p110δ becomes gradually elevated during human breastcancer progression from grade I to grade III. Moreover, pharmacologicalinactivation of p110δ in mice abrogated the formation of tumours and therecruitment of macrophages to tumour sites and strongly affected the survival,proliferation and apoptosis of grafted tumour cells. Pharmacological inactivationof p110δ in mice with defective macrophages or in mice with normal macrophagesbut grafted with p110δ-lacking tumours suppressed only partly tumour growth,indicating a requisite role of p110δ in both macrophages and cancer cells intumour progression. Adoptive transfer of δD910A/D910A macrophages into mice with defected macrophages suppressed tumour growth, eliminated the recruitment ofmacrophages to tumour sites and prevented metastasis compared with mice thatreceived WT macrophages further establishing that inactivation of p110δ inmacrophage prevents tumour progression. Our work provides the first in vivoevidence for a critical role of p110δ in cancer cells and macrophages duringsolid tumour growth and may pave the way for the use of p110δ inhibitors inbreast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0717-4 PMCID: PMC5992183PMID: 29880805
