KinaseMIB-binding profiles at baseline without perturbation proteomically distinguishedthe four breast cancer subtypes. Understudied kinases, whose disease associationsand pharmacology are generally unexplored, were highly represented in MIB-bindingtaxonomies and are integrated into signaling subnetworks with kinases that havebeen previously well characterized in breast cancer. Computationally it waspossible to define subtypes using profiles of less than 50 of the more than 300kinases bound to MIBs that included understudied as well as metabolic and lipidkinases. Furthermore, analysis of MIB-binding profiles established potentialfunctional annotations for these understudied kinases. Thus, comprehensiveMIBs-based capture of kinases provides a unique proteomics-based method forintegration of poorly characterized kinases of the understudied kinome intofunctional subnetworks in breast cancer cells and tumors that is not possibleusing genomic strategies. The MIB-binding profiles readily definedsubtype-selective differential adaptive kinome reprogramming in response totargeted kinase inhibition, demonstrating how MIB profiles can be used indetermining dynamic kinome changes that result in subtype selective phenotypicstate changes.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24337 PMCID: PMC5884642PMID: 29643987
