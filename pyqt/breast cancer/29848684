The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of CHI3L1 in angiogenesisin invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC) (n=110).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the expression of CHI3L1, CD31, CD34, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA, VEGFC and VEGFD). Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to determine thelevel of CHI3L1 mRNA and protein.RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry demonstrated positive correlation between CHI3L1expression and angiogenesis markers: CD31 (r=0.34, p=0.0003), CD34 (r=0.24,p=0.012), VEGFD (r=0.24, p=0.013). Higher CHI3L1 expression in estrogenreceptor-negative (p=0.041) and progesterone receptor-negative (p=0.014) cancerwas observed. Higher CHI3L1 expression was reported in cancer tissues incomparison to non-malignant breast lesions.CONCLUSION: These results suggest a potential role of CHI3L1 in angiogenesis inIDC and may suggest its involvement in cancer progression.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12602 PMID: 29848684  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
