Electronic address: edward.chow@sunnybrook.ca.Radiation dermatitis is a common side effect of radiotherapy. Radiationdermatitis has been investigated for decades, and many approaches have beenproposed to limit its incidence and severity. The purpose of the presentsystematic review was to summarize the approaches and findings of studies testingvarious methods for management of radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients.Medline, Cochrane, and Embase were searched for studies pertaining toradiation-induced skin toxicity in breast cancer patients. The search resultswere limited to randomized trials of external beam radiotherapy conducted inhumans and reported in the English language. The primary outcome was theincidence or severity of radiation dermatitis. Descriptive statistical analyseswere performed. A total of 96 studies were included in the present review. These evaluated the effect of different radiotherapy techniques, topical treatments,supplements, skin care regimens, and treatments on radiation dermatitis. Fewtopical agents and oral supplements demonstrated their effectiveness across therandomized trials; however, various radiotherapy techniques, such asintensity-modulated radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy, acceleratedpartial breast irradiation, simultaneous integrated boost, and prone positioning consistently demonstrated decreased rates of radiation dermatitis, despite thelimited number of studies in which they were evaluated.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
