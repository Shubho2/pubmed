China.In the present study, the expression level of microRNA-146a-5p (miR-146a-5p) inbreast cancer tissue and cell lines was investigated and its effects onproliferation of breast cancer cells. miR-146a-5p expression was detected byreverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction in breast cancertissues, paraneoplastic tissue (collected by The Department of Oncology ofChanghai Hospital from January 2014 to June 2015), breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and normal breast epithelial cell line MCF 10A. Bioinformatics analysis wasconducted to forecast target genes of miR-146a-5p, which was further verified by fluorescent reporter gene detection. The results demonstrated the expressionlevel of miR-146a-5p in breast cancer tissue was significantly higher, comparedwith paraneoplastic tissue (P<0.01), and the expression level of miR-146a-5p inMCF-7 cells was significantly higher, compared with MCF 10A cells (P<0.01).Overexpression of miR-146a-5p in MCF-7 cells can promote the proliferation, andlow expression miR-146a-5p in MCF-7 can inhibit the proliferation. BRCA1 wasfurther identified as a target gene of miR-146a-5p by bioinformatics analysis andfluorescent reporter gene detection. It was concluded that miR-146a-5p isexpressed in breast cancer tissue and breast cancer cell line and may regulatethe proliferation of MCF-7 via BRCA1.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8589 PMCID: PMC6004703PMID: 29928360
