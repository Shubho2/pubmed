The goal of this study was to identify baselineclinicopathological variables that are associated with residual disease, and toevaluate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on both the invasive and ductalcarcinoma in situ (DCIS) components in TNBC.METHODS: Patients with TNBC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed bysurgical resection were identified. Patients with a pCR were compared with those who had residual disease in the breast and/or lymph nodes. Clinicopathologicalvariables were analysed to determine their association with residual disease.RESULTS: Of the 328 patients, 36·9 per cent had no residual disease and 9·1 percent had residual DCIS only. Patients with residual disease were more likely tohave malignant microcalcifications (P = 0·023) and DCIS on the initial coreneedle biopsy (CNB) (P = 0·030). Variables independently associated with residualdisease included: DCIS on CNB (odds ratio (OR) 2·46; P = 0·022), T2 disease (OR2·40; P = 0·029), N1 status (OR 2·03; P = 0·030) and low Ki-67 (OR 2·41;P = 0·083). Imaging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy had an accuracy of 71·7 (95per cent c.i. 66·3 to 76·6) per cent and a negative predictive value of 76·9(60·7 to 88·9) per cent for identifying residual disease in the breast and lymph nodes. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not eradicate the DCIS component in 55 percent of patients.CONCLUSION: The presence of microcalcifications on imaging and DCIS on initialCNB are associated with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC. These variables can aid in identifying patients with TNBC suitable for inclusion in trials evaluating non-surgical management after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.© 2018 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/bjs.10755 PMID: 29465744
