Methods: A total of 2 184 cases of IBC-NST diagnosed at the FourthHospital of Hebei Medical University from January 2006 to December 2008 werecollected. All the cases were diagnosed according to the latest guideline andstandard. After excluding cases of shrinkage due to tissue fixation, 483 caseswith RC were identified, and the clinical and pathological features wereretrospectively analyzed. Results: Among the 483 cases, the mean tumor size was2.0 cm (range 0.8 to 4.8 cm). Two hundred and thirty-two cases were moderatelydifferentiated (48.0%), 97 were well differentiated (20.1%), 154 were poorlydifferentiated (31.9%); 382 (79.1%) cases were of stages Ⅰ and Ⅱ. A total of 177 cases (36.7%) had lymphatic invasion; nodal metastasis were found in 202 cases(41.8%). Extensive RC was found in 237 of 483 cases (49.1%). Follow-upinformation was available in 407 patients, and 46 died of breast cancer withsurvival time from 37 to 103 months. Multivariate analysis of extensive RC showedthat tumor size, histological grade and nodal metastasis were risk factors ofpatients with IBC-NST (P<0.05). Lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis were riskfactors for extensive RCs in patients with IBC-NST (P<0.05). There was a highprobability of lymph node metastasis in patients of extensive RC withoutlymphatic invasion, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05).Conclusions: Both lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis are risk factors ofextensive RC. The presence of extensive RC in IBC-NST patients is correlated withpoor outcome. Tumors with lymphatic invasion are more likely to show extensiveRC.Publisher: 目的：探讨非特殊型浸润性乳腺癌(invasive breast carcinoma of no specifictype，IBC-NST)中大范围癌周间隙(>20%的肿瘤区域内出现癌周间隙)的出现对患者预后的影响。方法：收集河北医科大学第四医院2006年1月至2008年12月经病理确诊的2184例IBC-NST患者的病理资料，按照2012版WHO乳腺肿瘤病理学和遗传学分类标准复核诊断，剔除因组织固定问题导致的固缩，筛选出具有癌周间隙特征的病例483例，对其大范围癌周间隙、淋巴管侵犯、淋巴结转移、组织学分级、预后等临床病理资料进行回顾性分析。 结果： 483例患者中肿瘤最大径0.8～4.8 cm，平均2.0 cm。组织学分级1级97例(20.1%)，2级232例(48.0%)，3级154例(31.9%)；Ⅰ～Ⅱ期患者382例(79.1%)；177例(36.7%)出现了淋巴管侵犯，202例(41.8%)出现了淋巴结转移；237例(49.1%)出现了大范围癌周间隙。407例患者有完整的随访资料，359例存活，生存时间37～103个月。多因素分析结果显示：肿瘤大小、组织学分级、淋巴结转移是IBC-NST患者生存的危险因素(P<0.05)；淋巴管侵犯、淋巴结转移是IBC-NST患者出现大范围癌周间隙的危险因素(P<0.05)。出现大范围癌周间隙而没有淋巴管侵犯时，淋巴结转移的几率较高，差异具有统计学意义(P<0.05)。结论：淋巴管侵犯、淋巴结转移均是IBC-NST患者出现大范围癌周间隙的危险因素，出现大范围癌周间隙与IBC-NST患者预后差相关，且具有淋巴结转移的IBC-NST患者更常见大范围癌周间隙。.PMID: 29534360  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
