China.As a major common malignant tumor in women, the malignant behavior of breastcancer, which includes tumorigenesis and metastasis, is associated with estrogen,particularly 17β-estradiol (E2). With accumulating evidence demonstrating thatcancer stem-like cells (CSCs) serve a function in the malignant behavior ofbreast cancer, including metastasis, recurrence and chemoresistance, the effects of E2 on the physiological processes of CSCs have been attracting more attention.In the present study, in order to investigate the effects of E2 on CSCs, CSCsfrom the MCF7 breast cancer cell line were isolated and treated with 1, 10 and 50nM E2. Detection of cell proliferation following E2 treatment revealed that 10 nME2 treatment inhibited cell proliferation, whereas 50 nM E2 treatment resulted inthe induction of apoptosis on CSCs. In order to further investigate the effectsof E2 treatment on migration, colony formation and the self-renewal capacity ofCSCs in vitro, cells were treated with 1 and 10 nM E2. As expected, compared withmock group, the self-renewal capacity of the CSCs was slightly increased by 10 nME2 treatment, while 1 nM exhibited no observable effect. E2 treatmentdemonstrated different effects on the proliferation, migration, colony formation and self-renewal capacity of CSCs in a dose-dependent manner.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7796 PMCID: PMC5796359PMID: 29467896
