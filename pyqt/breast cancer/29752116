In the last one decade,silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have become a remarkable choice for the development of new drugs due to their excellent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In thecurrent piece of work, we have synthesized AgNPs from the root extract of Phoenixdactylifera to test their antimicrobial and anti-cancer potential. UV-visiblespectra showed the surface plasmon resonance peak at 420 nm λmax corresponding tothe formation of silver nanoparticles, FTIR spectra further confirmed theinvolvement of biological moieties in AgNPs synthesis. Moreover, XRD analysisshowed the crystalline nature of AgNPs and predicted the crystallite size of 15to 40 nm. Electron microscopy analyses confirmed their spherical shape. Inaddition, synthesized AgNPs was also found to control the growth of C. albicansand E. coli on solid nutrient medium with 20 and 22 mm zone of inhibition,respectively. The 100% potency at 40 μg/ml AgNPs concentration was observedagainst E. coli and C. albicans after 4 h and 48 h incubation respectively.Importantly, AgNPs were also found to decrease the cell viability of MCF7 celllines in vitro with IC50 values of 29.6 μg/ml and could act as a controllingagent of human breast cancer. Based on our results, we conclude that biologicallysynthesized AgNPs exhibited multifunctional properties and could be used against human cancer and other infectious diseases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
