Clinical and pathological features can bechallenging for definitive diagnosis. Here, we report a rare case of a large AFin the axilla. Interestingly, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emissiontomography/computed tomography showed significant increase in standard uptakevalue. Surgical resection yielded a spindle cell tumor likely of fibromatosisorigin which was positive for Î²-catenin expression.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S165209 PMCID: PMC5983020PMID: 29881291
