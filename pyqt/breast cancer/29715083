There are ongoing studies focused ontargeting CSCs via anti-TF treatment, for breast and lung cancer therapy. Herein,the aim was to determine whether targeting TF could have an anti-CSC therapeutic role in colorectal cancer (CRC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evaluation of colonosphere-forming efficiency (CFE) andaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) expression level was used to quantify CSC activity in two CRC cell lines, after TF knockdown (TFKD) or TF over-expression (TFOE).RESULTS: TFKD resulted in increased levels of ALDH in SW620 (1.31±0.04-fold,p<0.001) and DLD-1 (1.63±0.14-fold, p=0.04) cells. CFE was increased in SW620(1.21±0.23% vs. 2.03±0.29%, p=0.01) and DLD-1 (0.41±0.12% vs. 0.68±0.9%, p=0.01) cells. Conversely, TFOE decreased ALDH expression (0.72±0.04-fold, p=0.001) andCFE (0.33±0.05% vs. 0.66±0.14%, p=0.006) in DLD-1, but had no impact on SW620cells.CONCLUSION: In the examined CRC cell lines, TF expression was inversely relatedto CSC activity suggesting that anti-TF therapies may not have a role in CRCtreatment.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12505 PMID: 29715083  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
