China.An ideal cancer therapeutic strategy is expected to possess potent ability to notonly ablate primary tumors but also prevent distance metastasis and relapse. Inthis study, human serum albumin was hybridized with hemoglobin by intermolecular disulfide bonds to develop a hybrid protein oxygen nanocarrier with chlorine e6encapsulated (C@HPOC) for oxygen self-sufficient photodynamic therapy (PDT).C@HPOC realized the tumor-targeted co-delivery of photosensitizer and oxygen,which remarkably relieved tumor hypoxia. C@HPOC was favorable for more efficient PDT and enhanced infiltration of CD8+ T cells in tumors. Moreover, oxygen-boostedPDT of C@HPOC induced immunogenic cell death, with the release ofdanger-associated molecular patterns to activate dendritic cells, T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells in vivo. Notably, C@HPOC-mediated immunogenic PDT could destroy primary tumors and effectively suppress distant tumors and lungmetastasis in a metastatic triple-negative breast cancer model by evokingsystemic anti-tumor immunity. This study provides a paradigm of oxygen-augmented immunogenic PDT for metastatic cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.8b04371 PMID: 30005164
