To uncoverHippo-independent YAP regulators, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen thatidentifies the transcriptional repressor protein Trichorhinophalangeal Syndrome 1(TRPS1) as a potent repressor of YAP-dependent transactivation. We show thatTRPS1 globally regulates YAP-dependent transcription by binding to a large set ofjoint genomic sites, mainly enhancers. TRPS1 represses YAP-dependent function by recruiting a spectrum of corepressor complexes to joint sites. Loss of TRPS1leads to activation of enhancers due to increased H3K27 acetylation and analtered promoter-enhancer interaction landscape. TRPS1 is commonly amplified inbreast cancer, which suggests that restrained YAP activity favours tumour growth.High TRPS1 activity is associated with decreased YAP activity and leads todecreased frequency of tumour-infiltrating immune cells. Our study uncovers TRPS1as an epigenetic regulator of YAP activity in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05370-7 PMCID: PMC6079100PMID: 30082728
