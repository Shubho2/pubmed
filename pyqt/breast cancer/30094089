Dysregulated expression of miRNAs in liver cancer is well documented, and the involvement of miRNAs in liver cancer initiation and progression has also been described. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subset ofcells known to be at the root of cancer recurrence and resistance to therapy. In this review, we highlight recent reports indicating that miRNAs participate inthe regulation of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs). The Wnt signaling pathway,TGF-beta signaling pathway, JAK/STAT signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymaltransition (EMT) are all closely correlated with the miRNA modulation of LCSCs.In addition, several miRNAs have been demonstrated to be involved in theregulation of LCSCs in response to therapy sensitivity. Targeting LCSCs byregulating the expression of these miRNAs represents a potential therapeuticstrategy for treating cancer drug resistance, metastasis and recurrence in thenear future.PMID: 30094089
