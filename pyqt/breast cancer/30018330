Here, we show that in the mammary glands ofnon-tumor bearing mice, stromal-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten)deletion invokes radiation-induced genomic instability in neighboring epithelium.In these animals, a single dose of whole-body radiation causes focal mammarylobuloalveolar hyperplasia through paracrine epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) activation, and EGFR inhibition abrogates these cellular changes. Byanalyzing human tissue, we discover that stromal PTEN is lost in a subset ofnormal breast samples obtained from reduction mammoplasty, and is predictive ofrecurrence in breast cancer patients. Combined, these data indicate thatdiagnostic or therapeutic chest radiation may predispose patients with decreased stromal PTEN expression to secondary breast cancer, and that prophylactic EGFRinhibition may reduce this risk.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05266-6 PMCID: PMC6050339PMID: 30018330
