Electronicaddress: xuxundi@csu.edu.cn.The malignant phenotype of the cells resulting from human liver cancer is driven by liver cancer stem-like cells (LCSLCs). Transient Receptor PotentialVanilloid-type 2 channel (TRPV2) contributes to the progression of differenttumor types, including liver cancer. In the current study, the TRPV2 expressionlevels give rise to the effect on stemness in liver cancer cell lines. TRPV2knockdown in HepG2 cells enhanced spheroid and colony formation, and expressionlevels of CD133, CD44 and ALDH1 whereas the opposite effects were observed inTRPV2 enforced expression in SMMC-7721 cells. Furthermore, TRPV2 overexpressionrestored inhibition of spheroid and colony formation, and stem cell markersexpression in HepG2 cells with TRPV2 silencing. The addition of the TRPV2 agonistprobenecid and the TRPV2 antagonist tranilast suppressed and/or increased invitro spheroid and colony formation, and stem cell marker expression of LCSLCsand/or liver cancer cell lines, respectively. Notably, probenecid and tranilastsignificantly inhibited or promoted tumor growth of HepG2 xenografts in thesevere combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model, respectively. TRPV2expression at protein levels revealed converse correlation with those of CD133and CD44 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue. Collectively, the datademonstrate that TRPV2 exert effects on stemness of liver cancer and is apotential target in the treatment of human liver cancer patients.Copyright Â© 2018.
