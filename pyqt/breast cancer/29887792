A 47-year-old female patientdiagnosed with stage IV thymic carcinoma and previously treated withchemoradiation was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer during a periodicreview. Color Doppler ultrasonography showed a low-echo real occupancy in thebreast. Pathological examination of the breast mass confirmed the diagnosis ofthymic carcinoma metastasis.Conclusion: Hematogenous metastasis of thymic carcinoma to the breast is rare butnot exceptional, and long-term survival can be expected with appropriatetreatment.DOI: 10.1159/000486028 PMCID: PMC5981663 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29887792
