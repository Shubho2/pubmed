Recently, several reportshave linked lncRNAs to cancer drug resistance. However, the role of lncRNAs inTamR is unclear. To identify TamR-related lncRNAs, we first used a bioinformatic approach to predict whether they have connection with known TamR-associated genesby starBase v2.0 and divided them into two groups. Group A contains lncRNAs that connect with known TamR genes and group B contains lncRNAs that show no predictedinteraction. Among the 12 lncRNAs in group A, 58.3% of them are either up- ordownregulated in MCF-7/TamR cells compared to the sensitive cells. In contrast,the expression levels of all group B lncRNAs are not changed in MCF-7/TamR cells.LINC00894-002 exhibits the most sophisticated network pattern and is the mostdownregulated lncRNA in MCF-7/TamR cells. Moreover, we find that LINC00894-002 isdirectly upregulated by ERα. Knocking down LINC00894-002 downregulates expressionof miR-200a-3p and miR-200b-3p, upregulates the expression of TGF-β2 and ZEB1,and finally contributes to TamR. Herein, we report the first case of aninhibitory lncRNA against TamR through the miR-200-TGF-β2-ZEB1 signaling pathway.DOI: 10.1134/S0006297918050139 PMID: 29738694  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
