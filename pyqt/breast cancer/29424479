Targeted delivery ofdrugs to tumor tissue and tumor vasculature is a promising approach for treating solid tumors while enhancing specificity and reducing systemic toxicity. AXT050, a collagen-IV derived peptide with both antitumor and antiangiogenic properties, is shown to bind to tumor-associated integrins with high affinity, which leads totargeted accumulation in tumor tissue. AXT050 conjugated to PLGA-PEG NPs atprecisely controlled surface density functions both as a targeting agent to humantumor cells and demonstrates potential for simultaneous antitumorigenic andantiangiogenic activity. These targeted NPs cause inhibition of adhesion andproliferation in vitro when added to human triple-negative breast cancer cellsand microvascular endothelial cells through binding to integrin αV β3 .Furthermore, we find an in vivo biphasic relationship between tumor targeting andsurface coating density of NPs coated with AXT050. NPs with an intermediate levelof 10% peptide surface coating show approximately twofold greater accumulation intumors and lower accumulation in the liver compared to nontargeted PLGA-PEG NPsin a murine biodistribution model. Display of biomimetic peptides from NPsurfaces to both target and inhibit cancer cells has the potential to enhance theactivity of cancer nanomedicines. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
