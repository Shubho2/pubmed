Epub 2018 Feb 14.Single arm phase II study of oral vitamin B12 for the treatment ofmusculoskeletal symptoms associated with aromatase inhibitors in women with earlystage breast cancer.Campbell A(1)(2), Heydarian R(1), Ochoa C(1), Dwivedi AK(3), Nahleh ZA(4).Author information: (1)Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Texas TechUniversity Health Sciences Center El Paso (TTUHSC EP), El Paso, TX, USA.(2)Metallurgical, Materials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas at ElPaso (UTEP), El Paso, TX, USA.(3)Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Department of Biomedical Sciences,Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso (TTUHSC EP), El Paso, TX,USA.(4)Department of Hematology-Oncology, Maroone Cancer Center, Cleveland ClinicFlorida, Weston, FL, USA.Breast cancer patients receiving endocrine therapy with aromatase Inhibitors(AIs) often experience musculoskeletal and joint-related side effects. Thepurpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of Vitamin B12 supplements onmusculoskeletal symptoms such as pain and arthralgias induced by AIs and tocorrelate response with serum and inflammatory biomarkers. Upon receivingapproval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), the majority of the patientsconsented into the study were treated at the Texas Tech Breast Care Center.Included were patients who had a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (StagesI-III), and were experiencing significant musculoskeletal symptoms associated to AIs. Only patients with an average pain score ≥ 4, as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) questionnaire, were included in the study.Participants received 2500 mcg of sublingual vitamin B12 daily for 90 days.Assessments at baseline and at 3 months included: BPI-SF pain scores, the impact on quality of life determined by Functional Assessment of CancerTherapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES), and correlative serum markers relative tobaseline (a pre-post study). A total of forty-one patients were enrolled. Averagepain scores were improved by 34% (P < .0001) at 3 months compared to baseline. Inaddition, a 23% improvement in worst pain was noted (P = .0003). Analysis of the results for the FACT-ES scoring showed improvement on all scales. No significant adverse events were observed. Decrease in pain score was correlated withincreased serum B12 levels. This study suggests that Vitamin B12 reduces pain andimproves quality of life for patients taking AIs who experienced AI-relatedmusculoskeletal symptoms. If confirmed in large randomized prospective trials,Vitamin B12 would be a safe and cost-effective option for the treatment ofAI-related musculoskeletal symptoms.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.12951 PMID: 29442401
