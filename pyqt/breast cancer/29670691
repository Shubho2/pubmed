Barañains/n, E-31008 Pamplona, Spain.A series of 16 new diselenide-acylselenourea conjugates have been designedfollowing the fragment-based drug strategy. Compound in vitro cytotoxic potentialwas evaluated against six human cancer cell lines and two nonmalignant derivedcell lines with the aim of determining their potency and selectivity. Ninederivatives exhibited GI50 values under 10 μM in at least four cancer cell lines.A clear gap situated phenyl substitution over heterocyclic moieties in terms ofselectivity. Among carbocyclic compounds, derivatives 2 and 7 significantlyinhibited cell growth of breast adenocarcinoma cells with GI50 values of 1.30 and0.15 nM, respectively, with selectivity indexes 12 and 121 times higher thanthose obtained for doxorubicin. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated thatcompounds 2 and 7 induce cell cycle arrest and autophagy-dependent cell deathevidenced by the blockage of cell death with pretreatment with wortmannin orchloroquine and confirmed by the upregulation of the markers Beclin1 and LC3B in MCF-7 cells.DOI: 10.1021/acsmedchemlett.7b00482 PMCID: PMC5900345 [Available on 2019-04-12]PMID: 29670691
