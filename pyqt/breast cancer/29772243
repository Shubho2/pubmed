In this research, we have synthesized and characterized a totalof thirty-one (31) new nitrogenous derivatives of progesterone and testosterone. The synthesized derivatives (1-31) were screened for their anti-cancer potential against MCF-7 and PC-3 cell lines of breast using MTT assay. The compounds1-31exhibited significant inhibitory potentials against MCF-7 and PC-3 celllines. In MCF-7 assay, compound 17 displayed IC50 value of 04 ± 0.02 μM whilecompound 18 was leading in PC-3 assay with IC50 of 03.14 ± 0.4 μM. Tamoxifen was used as positive control which exhibited an IC50of 0.12 ± 0.03 and 0.26 ± 0.01 μMagainst MCF-7 and PC-3 respectively. The compounds also showed goodanti-inflammatory activity according to oxidative burst inhibition bychemiluminescence technique where ibuprofen was used as positive control with73.2 ± 1.4% ROS inhibition. The compounds showed the percent ROS inhibitionbetween 23.2 ± 0.2 and -3.2 ± 4.1. The results of the compounds were comparedwith the positive control ibuprofen. Molecular docking correlations suggest that the compounds exerted their inhibitory activity by binding to the active of theenzyme.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
