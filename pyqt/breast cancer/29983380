[Epub ahead of print]Conservative Management of Positive Axilla After Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy-TheNeed for, and Review of, Techniques Used for Lymph Node Localization.Green M(1), Neamonitou F(2), Vidya R(2).Author information: (1)Department of Breast Surgery, New Cross Hospital, Royal Wolverhampton NHS,Wolverhampton, United Kingdom. Electronic address: matthewgreen2@nhs.net.(2)Department of Breast Surgery, New Cross Hospital, Royal Wolverhampton NHS,Wolverhampton, United Kingdom.Involvement of axillary lymph nodes is an important prognostic factor inrelationship to the management of breast cancer. However, the use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy is widespread in the treatment of positive axilla and suchtreatment leads to downstaging of axillary disease. Hence, the role of targetedaxillary lymph node biopsy appears to play a vital role after primary systemictherapy. Given that this is a relatively novel approach, we have discussed theevidence for this approach and the different techniques currently available forlocalization of biopsy-proven metastatic axillary lymph nodes. We have alsohighlighted the need for universal guidelines for conservative management ofpositive axilla after systemic therapy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
