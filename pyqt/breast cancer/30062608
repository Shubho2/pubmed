Mammographic density is a strong, independent riskfactor for breast cancer, and some breast cancer risk factors have been shown to modify mammographic density. However, the effect of physical activity onmammographic density, studied predominantly among Caucasians, has yieldedconflicting results. In this study, we examined, in an Asian population, theassociation between physical activity and mammographic density.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 2,377 Malaysian women aged40-74 years. Physical activity information was obtained at screening mammogramand mammographic density was measured from mammograms by the area-based STRATUSmethod (n = 1,522) and the volumetric Volpara™ (n = 1,200) method. Linearregression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between physicalactivity and mammographic density, adjusting for potential confounders.RESULTS: We observed that recent physical activity was associated with area-basedmammographic density measures among postmenopausal women, but not premenopausalwomen. In the fully adjusted model, postmenopausal women with the highest levelof recent physical activity had 8.0 cm2 [95% confidence interval: 1.3, 14.3 cm2] lower non-dense area and 3.1% [0.1, 6.3%] higher area-based percent density,compared to women with the lowest level of recent physical activity. Physicalactivity was not associated to volumetric mammographic density.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the beneficial effects of physicalactivity on breast cancer risk may not be measurable through mammographicdensity. Future research is needed to identify appropriate biomarkers to assessthe effect of physical activity on breast cancer risk.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1064-6 PMID: 30062608
