In our previous study, we have demonstrated that Nectin-2 is over-expressed in breast and ovarian cancer tissues by usinggene expression analysis and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we discoveredmultiple anti-Nectin-2 fully human monoclonal antibodies which inhibited tumorgrowth in in vivo subcutaneous xenograft models with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as the principal mechanism of action. In this report, weassessed the toxicity of Y-443, a fully human IgG1/kappa anti-Nectin-2 monoclonalantibody exhibiting strong in vitro ADCC and in vivo anti-tumor activity incynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis (Cynos)). Unexpectedly, uponadministration, Y-443 induced strong thrombocytopenia through Nectin-2 expressed on Cyno platelets, presumably followed by phagocytosis in the mononuclearphagocytic system. To mitigate the adverse safety profile, we mutated the Fcregion of Y-443 to reduce the Fc binding activity to FcÎ³ receptor I, which is theprimary receptor for phagocytosis on macrophages. Moreover, we further engineeredthe Fc through defucosylation to maintain ADCC activity. The resultant Fcengineered antibody, termed Y-634, demonstrated diminished thrombocytopenia inCyno toxicological studies and maintained anti-tumor activity in a mousexenograft model. These findings suggest that Y-634 may have a therapeuticpotential for the treatment of Nectin-2 positive cancers, and moreover, Fcengineering is a potential mitigation strategy to ameliorate safety liabilitiesin antibody induced thrombocytopenia while maintaining antibody potency.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196422 PMCID: PMC5933732PMID: 29723247  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
