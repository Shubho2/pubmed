HLsurvivors are recommended to have annual dual screening with mammogram (MMG) and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They are also recommended to undergoechocardiogram (echo) 5 years after completion of radiation. We performed a pilotstudy to characterize the women who are and are not receiving proper dualscreening for breast cancer and baseline echo, and to examine the impact of aLTFU clinic consultation on screening.METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 114 women treated for HL at Universityof Minnesota (UMN) between 1993 and 2009 was performed. Demographics, disease andtreatment history (age at diagnosis, stage, radiation dose and field,chemotherapy, recurrence) were assessed, as well as screening practices (MMG,MRI, both and echo), participation in LTFU clinic, and recommendations fromproviders. Data was summated in yes/no (y/n) format; statistical analysis wasperformed using chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. Breast cancer andcardiovascular screening outcomes were compared by participation in the LTFUclinic (y/n) using Fisher's exact tests. P values < 0.05 were consideredstatistically significant.RESULTS: Forty-one of 114 women met inclusion criteria and had follow-up data foranalysis. Median age at diagnosis was 29 years; 67.6% were diagnosed at stageIIa. Median dose of radiation was 3570 cGy. 56.1% participated in the LTFU clinicat the UMN. 36.6% had dual screening with both MMG and MRI, 41.5% had screeningwith only MMG, and 19.5% had no screening performed. Women were more likely tohave dual screening if they were seen in LTFU clinic vs not seen in LTFU clinic(52.2 vs 16.7%, p = 0.02). 67.5% of women were screened with echo; women werealso more likely to have screening with echo if seen in LTFU clinic vs not seen(86.4 vs 44.4%, p = 0.007).CONCLUSION: Many women are not getting the proper dual screening for breastcancer despite their increased risk, with only 36.6% of our study sample getting dual screening. Having a consultation in a LTFU clinic increases dual screeningfor breast cancer and echo screening for cardiovascular disease. Proper screeningallows for detection of secondary breast cancer at earlier stages where treatmentcan be local therapy. Diagnosing CV disease early could allow for properpreventative treatment or intervention.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4072-x PMID: 29417294
