Major epigenetic modifications in both DNAand histone could be involved in upregulation of immune checkpoints in cancer.Methods: Expressions of different immune checkpoint genes and PD-L1 were assessedusing qRT-PCR, and the underlying epigenetic modifications including CpGmethylation and repressive histone abundance were determined using bisulfitesequencing, and histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP),respectively.Results: We first assessed the expression level of six immune checkpoints/ligandsand found that PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 were significantly upregulated inbreast tumor tissues (TT), compared with breast normal tissues (NT). Weinvestigated the epigenetic modifications beyond this upregulation in immunecheckpoint genes. Interestingly, we found that CpG islands in the promoterregions of PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIM-3 were significantly hypomethylated in tumorcompared with normal tissues. Additionally, CpG islands of PD-L1 promoter werecompletely demethylated (100%), LAG-3 were highly hypomethylated (80-90%), andTIGIT were poorly hypomethylated (20-30%), in both NT and TT. These demethylationfindings are in accordance with the relative expression data that, out of allthese genes, PD-L1 was highly expressed and completely demethylated and TIGIT waspoorly expressed and hypermethylated in both NT and TT. Moreover, bindings ofH3K9me3 and H3K27me3 were found to be reduced in the promoter loci of PD-1,CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 in tumor tissues.Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that both DNA and histone modifications areinvolved in upregulation of PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3 in breast tumor tissueand these epigenetic modifications could be useful as diagnostic/prognosticbiomarkers and/or therapeutic targets in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13148-018-0512-1 PMCID: PMC6003083PMID: 29983831
