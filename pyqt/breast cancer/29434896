China.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy ofintra-arterial interventional therapy (IAIT) in the treatment of inoperable localadvanced breast cancer (LABC). A total of 7 patients with pathologically proveninoperable LABC were included in the present study. Patients received 1-4 cycles of IAIT prior to mastectomy and postoperative adjuvant therapy. The safety andclinical outcomes of IAIT were retrospectively analyzed. Between February 2009 toSeptember 2016, 7 patients received IAIT. The youngest patient was 34 years oldand the eldest was 90 years old. The tumor size ranged between 6 and 20 cm indiameter. A total of 5 patients presented with palpable lymph nodes, while noneof the patients exhibited distant metastatic disease. A total of 6 patientsreceived â‰¥1 cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to IAIT and no severe sideeffects were observed. Overall, 6 patients exhibited a partial response and 1presented with stable disease following treatment. The range of progression-free survival was 6-88 months. In total, 1 patient succumbed as a result of anotherdisease 8 months after IAIT, another succumbed from carcinoma of the rightfallopian tube and multiple organ metastases 9 months after IAIT, and anothersurvived for 11 months and died of heart disease after IAIT. The other 4 patientsremain alive. IAIT is safe and effective for patients with inoperable LABC, andthus, may be an appropriate alternative for patients who are not responsive to orare unable to tolerate neoadjuvant chemotherapy.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7507 PMCID: PMC5777100PMID: 29434896
