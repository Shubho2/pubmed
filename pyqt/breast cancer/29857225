Cancer in old or postmenopausal women weremore visible on BSGI (p = 0.003, 0.046). Cancers ≥ 1.0 cm in size weresignificantly more visible on BSGI than those <1 cm in size (p = 0.002). Cancers in fatty breasts were more visible than those in dense breasts (p = 0.042).CONCLUSION: Invasive cancers in older, postmenopausal patients, cancers with size≥1.0 cm, and those with fatty breast are better visualized by BSGI, than those inyounger, premenopausal patients, with size <1.0 cm and dense breast.Copyright © 2018.
