However, these procedures are often not taught in standardtraining for breast surgeons, and a simple guide for surgeons to start performingbasic oncoplastic breast surgery techniques is not available.METHODS: The basic concepts of oncoplastic breast surgery and the tools neededprior to starting these types of procedures are discussed, and the procedure, in a stepwise pattern, for the building blocks of oncoplastic techniques isoutlined.RESULTS: The importance of oncoplastics from a quality of life and oncologicstandpoint are described. Key concepts are defined and the decision on when it isnecessary to consult reconstructive plastic surgeryÂ is delineated. The basicnecessities for oncoplastic breast surgery, including patient photographs,important intraoperative tools, anatomic knowledge, and patient selection, arediscussed. The building block procedures include aesthetic scar placement,parenchymal closure, deepithelialization, and donut therapeutic mastopexy, which are described in detail.CONCLUSIONS: Oncoplastic breast surgery techniques and clinical reasoning buildon one another, allowing a surgeon to move from level I to level II oncoplasticprocedures. Even the most basic level I breast conservation oncoplastic skillscan improve a patient's cosmetic outcome and are easily learned by a generalsurgeon.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6604-5 PMID: 29968024
