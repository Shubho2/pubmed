Thus far, polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PLN) loadedchemotherapeutic agents has been used to overcome MDR in breast cancer. In thisstudy, we prepared psoralen polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (PSO-PLN) toreverse drug resistant MCF-7/ADR cells in vitro and in vivo. PSO-PLN was preparedby the emulsification evaporation-low temperature solidification method. Theformulation, water solubility and bioavailability, particle size, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency, and in vitro release experiments were optimized inorder to improve the activity of PSO to reverse MDR. Optimal formulation: soybeanphospholipids 50 mg, poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) 15 mg, PSO 3 mg, andTween-80 1%. The PSO-PLN possessed a round appearance, uniform size, exhibited noadhesion. The average particle size was 93.59 ± 2.87 nm, the dispersionco-efficient was 0.249 ± 0.06, the zeta potential was 25.47 ± 2.84 mV. In vitroanalyses revealed that PSO resistance index was 3.2, and PSO-PLN resistance indexwas 5.6, indicating that PSO-PLN versus MCF-7/ADR reversal effect wassignificant. Moreover, PSO-PLN is somewhat targeted to the liver, and has anantitumor effect in the xenograft model of drug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cells. Inconclusion, PSO-PLN not only reverses MDR but also improves therapeuticefficiency by enhancing sustained release of PSO.DOI: 10.1080/10717544.2018.1464084 PMID: 29695174
