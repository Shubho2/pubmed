Epub 2018 Jun 1.Hormonal Effects on Breast Density, Fibroglandular Tissue, and BackgroundParenchymal Enhancement.Heller SL(1), Young Lin LL(1), Melsaether AN(1), Moy L(1), Gao Y(1).Author information: (1)From the Department of Radiology, New York University School of Medicine, 160 E 34th St, New York, NY 10016.Breast density, fibroglandular tissue, and background parenchymal enhancement(BPE) are recognized independent biomarkers for breast cancer risk. For thisreason, reproducibility and consistency in objective assessment of theseparameters at mammography (breast density) and at magnetic resonance imaging(fibroglandular tissue and BPE) are clinically relevant. However, breast density,fibroglandular tissue, and BPE are manifestations of dynamic physiologicprocesses and may change in response to both endogenous and exogenous hormonalstimulation. It is therefore important for the radiologist to recognize settings in which hormonal stimulation may alter the appearance of these biomarkers atimaging and to appreciate how such changes may affect risk assessment, cancerdetection, and even prognosis. The purpose of this review article is therefore toreview key features and means of evaluating breast density, fibroglandulartissue, and BPE at imaging; to detail how endogenous and exogenous hormonalstimuli may affect breast density, fibroglandular tissue, and BPE, potentiallyaffecting radiologic interpretation; and, finally, to provide an update regardingcurrent hormone treatment guidelines and indications that may result in imagingchanges through hormone modulation.
