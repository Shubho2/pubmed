However, only ∼40% of treated patients demonstrate a clinical response to single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy. An intact tumor response to type-IIinterferon (i.e. IFN-γ) correlates with response to anti-PD-1, and patients with de novo or acquired resistance may harbor loss-of-function alterations in theJAK/STAT pathway, which lies downstream of the interferon gamma receptor(IFNGR1/2). In this study, we dissected the specific roles of individual JAK/STATpathway members on the IFN-γ response, and identified JAK1 as the primarymediator of JAK/STAT signaling associated with IFN-γ-induced expression ofantigen-presenting molecules MHC-I and MHC-II, as well as PD-L1 and thecytostatic response to IFN-γ. In contrast to the crucial role of JAK1, JAK2 waslargely dispensable in mediating most IFN-γ effects. In a mouse melanoma model,inhibition of JAK1/2 in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy partially blockedanti-tumor immunologic responses, while selective JAK2 inhibition appeared toaugment therapy. Amplification of JAK/STAT signaling in tumor cells throughgenetic inhibition of the negative regulator PTPN2 potentiated IFN-γ response in vitro and in vivo, and may be a target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1438106 PMCID: PMC5975601PMID: 29872580
