Percutaneous ablation presents an attractive minimally invasive alternative to conventional therapies. We performed a retrospectivereview of 69 patients with 102 painful spinal metastases undergoing microwaveablation and cementoplasty to determine the efficacy and safety of thistreatment.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Procedures were performed between January 2015 and October2016 with the patient under general anesthesia using image guidance for 102spinal metastases in 69 patients in the following areas: cervical (n = 2),thoracic (n = 50), lumbar (n = 34), and sacral (n = 16) spine. Tumor pathologies included the following: multiple myeloma (n = 10), breast (n = 27), lung (n =12), thyroid (n = 6), prostate (n = 5), colon (n = 4), renal cell (n = 3), oralsquamous cell (n = 1), and adenocarcinoma of unknown origin (n = 1). Proceduralefficacy was determined using the visual analog scale measured preprocedurallyand at 2-4 weeks and 20-24 weeks postprocedure. Tumor locoregional control wasassessed on follow-up cross-sectional imaging. Procedural complications wererecorded to establish the safety profile.RESULTS: The median ablation time was 4 minutes 30 seconds ± 7 seconds, andenergy dose, 4.1 ± 1.6 kJ. Median visual analog scale scores were the following: 7.0 ± 1.8 preprocedurally, 2 ± 1.6 at 2-4 weeks, and 2 ± 2.1 at 20-24 weeks.Eight patients died within 6 months following the procedure. Follow-up imaging inthe surviving patients at 20-24 weeks demonstrated no locoregional progression in59/61 patients. Two complications were documented (S1 nerve thermal injury andskin burn).CONCLUSIONS: Microwave ablation is an effective and safe treatment technique for painful spinal metastases. Further studies may be helpful in determining the roleof microwave ablation in locoregional control of metastases.© 2018 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.DOI: 10.3174/ajnr.A5680 PMID: 29794238
