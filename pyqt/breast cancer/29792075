[Epub ahead ofprint]Cancer/health communication and breast/cervical cancer screening among AsianAmericans and five Asian ethnic groups.Jun J(1).Author information: (1)a The School of Journalism and Mass Communications , University of SouthCarolina , Columbia , SC , USA.OBJECTIVES: This paper is an examination of cancer/health communication factors(i.e. cancer/health information seeking, patient-provider communication (PPC),cancer screening information from providers) and screening for breast andcervical cancer among Asian Americans and five Asian ethnic groups (Chinese,Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, Vietnamese) in comparison to Whites. Additionally, the relationship between cancer/health communication disparity and cancerscreening gaps between Asian Americans and Whites was investigated.DESIGN: Data comes from a nationally representative sample of 2011-2014 HealthInformation National Trends Surveys (HINTS).RESULTS: Asian Americans and most Asian ethnic-groups reported significantlylower rates of cancer/health information seeking and lower evaluations for PPC ascompared to Whites, though differences within Asian ethnic groups were observed(Koreans' greater cancer/health information seeking, Japanese' higher PPCevaluation). When the cancer/health communication factors were controlled, Asian Americans' odds of cancer screening were increased. Especially, Asian Americans' odds of adhering to the breast cancer screening guideline became nearly 1.4 timesgreater than Whites.CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates that health organizations, providers, and Asian American patients' collaborative efforts to increase the access to quality cancer information, to make culturally competent but straightforward screeningrecommendations, and to practice effective communication in medical encounterswill contribute to diminishing cancer disparities among Asian Americans.DOI: 10.1080/13557858.2018.1478952 PMID: 29792075
