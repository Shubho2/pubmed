This is the first meta-analysis on this subject, aimed to facilitateintuitive interpretation of the available data by clinicians, guidelinecommittees and policy makers.METHODS: A literature search was performed on 1 September 2017 in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to identify all relevant studies. A rigorous dataextraction and standardisation process allowed pooling of clinical outcome datainto a meta-analysis.RESULTS: Eighty-nine studies consisting of 5350 unique patients were included.The mean follow-up was 1.9 years. Meta-analysis revealed a very high overallpatient and surgeon satisfaction rate of 94.3% and 95.7%, respectively, which wasalso confirmed by high satisfaction scores and Breast-Q scores. Overall, only 1.5sessions were needed to achieve the desired result. Though evidence on thelong-term volume retention is lacking, based on the current data it wascalculated to be 52.4% at one year. Only 5.0% of procedures resulted in clinical complications and 8.6% of breasts required biopsy due to abnormal clinical orradiological findings.CONCLUSIONS: AFT seems to be an effective procedure in breast reconstruction,reflected by the high patient and surgeon satisfaction and low incidence ofclinical and radiological complications. Future research should focus onevaluating the technical and patient factors influencing the rate of fatresorption as well as its oncological safety.Copyright Â© 2018 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and AestheticSurgeons.
