The search produced 423 studies, which wereassessed against 5 inclusion criteria. A meta-synthesis methodology was used toanalyze the data through taxonomic classification and constant targetedcomparison.RESULTS: Some 17 studies met the inclusion criteria, and findings from 16 studieswere synthesized. The role of the healthcare practitioner is noted as a majorinfluence on women's expectations, and in some instances, women did not feeladequately informed about the outcomes of surgery and the recovery process. Ingeneral, women's desire for normality and effective emotional coping shapes theirinformation needs.CONCLUSION: The information needs of women are better understood afterconsidering women's actual experiences with breast reconstruction. It isimportant to inform women of the immediate outcomes of reconstruction surgery andthe recovery process.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In an attempt to better address women's informationneeds, healthcare practitioners should discover women's initial expectations ofreconstruction as a starting point in the consultation.
