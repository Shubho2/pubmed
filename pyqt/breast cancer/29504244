Gene promoters that becomehypermethylated in aging and cancer share a common chromatin signature in EScells. In addition, there is also global DNA hypomethylation in both processes.However, the similarity of the regions where this loss of DNA methylation occurs is currently not well characterized, and it is unknown if such regions also sharea common chromatin signature in aging and cancer. To address this issue, weanalyzed TCGA DNA methylation data from a total of 2,311 samples, includingcontrol and cancer cases from patients with breast, kidney, thyroid, skin, brain,and lung tumors and healthy blood, and integrated the results with histone,chromatin state, and transcription factor binding site data from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects. We identified 98,857 CpG sites differentiallymethylated in aging and 286,746 in cancer. Hyper- and hypomethylated changes inboth processes each had a similar genomic distribution across tissues anddisplayed tissue-independent alterations. The identified hypermethylated regions in aging and cancer shared a similar bivalent chromatin signature. In contrast,hypomethylated DNA sequences occurred in very different chromatin contexts. DNAhypomethylated sequences were enriched at genomic regions marked with theactivating histone posttranslational modification H3K4me1 in aging, while incancer, loss of DNA methylation was primarily associated with the repressiveH3K9me3 mark. Our results suggest that the role of DNA methylation as a molecularlink between aging and cancer is more complex than previously thought.© 2018 The Authors.
