Arginase and nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) are two of thoseenzymes considered to be involved in tumorigenesis. The goal of this article was to study the involvement of arginase and NOS in the development of differentstages of breast cancer. Our results have shown that human serum arginaseactivity and NO (resp., and NOS activity) and polyamines quantities increased in parallel with cancer stage progression and decreased after neoadjuvantchemotherapy. For breast cancer, the only isoenzyme of arginase expressed inserum before and after chemotherapy was in a cationic form. The data ofLineweaver-Burk plot with a Km value of 2â€‰mM was calculated, which ischaracteristic for human liver type isoform of arginase. During electrophoresisat pH 8.9, the enzyme exhibited high electrophoretic mobility and was detectednear the anode. The presented results demonstrated that arginase in human serumwith breast cancer and after chemotherapy is not polymorphic. We suggest thatarginase and NOS inhibition has antitumor effects on cancer development, as itcan inhibit polyamines and NO levels, a precursor of cancer cell proliferation,metastasis, and tumor angiogenesis.DOI: 10.1155/2018/8696923 PMCID: PMC5952510PMID: 29854802
