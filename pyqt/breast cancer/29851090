Feasibility was determined by recruitment andrandomization rates, retention of participants and treatment protocol adherence, and was assessed during the recruiting and intervention periods. Data onparticipant satisfaction and adverse reactions of LLLT (PBM) were collected oncompletion of this study. Clinical outcomes (i.e., limb circumference,participant's perceived symptoms, psychological impacts, and activity disability)were assessed at baseline, and 6 and 12 weeks post-randomization.RESULTS: Over a 6-month recruitment window, 17 participants with BCRL wererecruited in the study, and randomized into the two groups (recruitment rate of81%, and randomization rate of 100%). Treatment adherence was high in the lasergroup (88.9% of participants completed all treatments). Retention rates were88.9% for the laser group and 100% for the control group at both 6 and 12 weekspost-randomization. All participants who completed LLLT (PBM) treatment indicatedthat they were satisfied with the treatment. No serious adverse reactions werereported in this study. Clinical outcomes failed to show additional benefits ofLLLT (PBM) intervention.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that it is feasible to conduct a fullypowered RCT to definitively test the effectiveness of the additional use of LLLT (PBM) in the management of BCRL. For such a trial, 114 participants will beneeded at baseline. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/lsm.22947 PMID: 29851090
