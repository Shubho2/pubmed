A less costly alternative isthe use of administrative databases. This study will evaluate administrative datain comparison to medical charts for breast cancer treatment information.Study Design and Setting: A retrospective cohort design identified 2,401 women inthe Ontario Breast Screening Program diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from2006 to 2009. Treatment data were obtained from the Activity Level Reporting and Canadian Institute of Health Information databases. Medical charts wereabstracted at cancer centres. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negativepredictive value, and kappa were calculated for receipt and type of treatment,and agreement was assessed for dates. Logistic regression evaluated factorsinfluencing agreement.Results: Sensitivity and specificity for receipt of radiotherapy (92.0%, 99.3%), chemotherapy (77.7%, 99.2%), and surgery (95.8%, 100%) were high but decreasedslightly for specific radiotherapy anatomic locations, chemotherapy protocols,and surgeries. Agreement increased by radiotherapy year (trend test, p < 0.0001).Stage II/III compared to stage I cancer decreased odds of agreement forchemotherapy (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.91) and increased agreement for partialmastectomy (OR = 3.36, 95% CI: 2.27-4.99). Exact agreement in treatment datesvaried from 83.0% to 96.5%.Conclusion: Administrative data can be accurately utilized for future breastcancer treatment studies.DOI: 10.1155/2018/9218595 PMCID: PMC5976924PMID: 29861727
