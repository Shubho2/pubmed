The outcomesinclude the change scores of the Decision Conflict Scale (DCS) and depression andanxiety subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at the 1and 3 months from baseline. The linear mixed model was employed to discover theimpact of caregivers' decisional role preference on the outcomes.FINDINGS: Of the 406, 137 (33.7%) showed an active role preference and 269(66.3%) showed a passive role preference. In the post hoc analysis of theadjusted differences of change scores between passive caregivers who receiveddecision aid (passive-decision aid) and active caregivers with decision aid(active-decision aid), non-significant differences were observed in the DCS.However, at the 3-month, the change scores of the HADS depression subscaleincreased by 4.43 (effect size, 0.71) and those of the HADS anxiety subscaleincreased by 4.14 (effect size, 0.61) in the passive-decision aid group than inactive-decision aid group, showing moderate to large difference.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that information might be ethicallyrecommended in a format that is interactive and tailored to how much anindividual wishes to be involved in the decision-making process.DOI: 10.1007/s11136-018-1814-7 PMID: 29478132
