As a result of theirdisease and treatment, they have to adapt to different physical and psychosocial late effects. Unfortunately, several studies have documented insufficiency in thesurvivorship healthcare system. The aim of this paper was to describe the processof development and testing of a novel Cancer Self-management Education programme (CSME programme) to improve patient-reported self-management and self-efficacyfor patients with breast cancer who were at the end of primary treatment. Thedevelopment of the educational programme was inspired by the Plan-Do-Study-Act(PDSA) circle and based on person-centred principles. It was conducted at aDanish university hospital. Nine oncology healthcare providers, two externalexperts in patient education and five patients were involved in the developmentand testing of the education programme. Implementation of dialogue-based toolswas used as an educational learning instrument in the SCME programme. The PDSAapproach to the development of the CSME programme resulted in a person-centredprogramme that could improve self-management and self-efficacy in thesurvivorship phase of patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s13187-018-1390-0 PMID: 30014171
