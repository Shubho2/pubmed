Methodological quality was assessed using the Jadad scale.Results: The results of the meta-analysis suggested that music intervention wassignificantly effective in lowering systolic blood pressure (standardized meandifference (SMD) -0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.85 to -0.42; p <0.00001), diastolic blood pressure (SMD -0.64, 95% CI -1.06 to -0.22; p = 0.003),and heart rate (SMD -0.45, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.24; p < 0.0001), and in relievinganxiety (Hamilton Scale: mean difference (MD) -7.04, 95% CI -9.31 to -4.78; p <0.00001; Self-Rating Anxiety Scale: MD -7.40, 95% CI -10.28 to -4.52; p <0.00001; State Anxiety Inventory: MD -12.40, 95% CI -21.86 to -2.94; p = 0.01),and depression (MD -7.39, 95% CI -8.35 to -6.43; p < 0.00001).Conclusion: This review provides clues that music intervention might partiallyimprove the physiological and psychological health of patients with breastcancer.DOI: 10.1159/000487073 PMCID: PMC6062713 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 30069179
