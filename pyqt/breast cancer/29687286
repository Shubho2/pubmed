The goal of this study was to determine the structure and distribution ofhaplotypes of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in early-onset breast cancer patients. Weenrolled 70 patients diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer. A total of 21 SNPs(11 on BRCA1 and 10 on BRCA2) and 1 dinucleotide deletion on BRCA1 were genotypedusing nested allele-specific PCR methods. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysiswas conducted, and haplotypes were deduced from the genotype data. Two tightlylinked LD blocks were observed on each of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Variant-freehaplotypes (TAT-AG for BRCA1 and ATA-AAT for BRCA2) were observed at a frequency of more than 50% on each gene along with variable frequencies of derivedhaplotypes. The variant 3'-subhaplotype CGC displayed strong LD with5'-subhaplotypes GA, AA, and GG on BRCA1 gene. Haplotypes ATA-AGT, ATC-AAT, andATA-AAC were the variant haplotypes frequent on BRCA2 gene. Although the clinicalsignificance of these derived haplotypes has not yet been established, it isexpected that some of these haplotypes, especially the less frequentsubhaplotypes, eventually will be shown to be indicative of a predisposition toearly-onset breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/5584_2018_147 PMID: 29687286
