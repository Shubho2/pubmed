Descriptive and regressionanalyses were conducted to characterize the sample and identify correlates oflifestyle behaviors.FINDINGS: The majority of participants (n = 156) were female (83%), insured(84%), and racial/ethnic minorities (29% Asian, 24% Latino, 15% AfricanAmerican). Participants' mean age at response was 50 years and mean time sincediagnosis was 9 years. Over half of survivors were overweight or obese. Fewparticipants reported engaging in regular physical activity (31%) and adhering tominimum guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption (32%). A substantialproportion of survivors consumed fast food in the past week (75%) and nearly half(48%) reported daily consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. Lower income wasassociated with inadequate fruit and vegetable intake. Fast food andsugar-sweetened beverage consumption was significantly higher among racial/ethnicminority survivors compared to non-Latino whites.CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of overweight and suboptimal adherence torecommended nutrition and physical activity behaviors were observed among cancer survivors with early onset disease. Cancer survivors diagnosed at a young age maybenefit from targeted interventions to address overweight and suboptimalnutrition and physical activity.DOI: 10.1080/07347332.2018.1448031 PMID: 29764334
