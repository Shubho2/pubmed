However, it's hydrophilic and thermo labile nature provideshindrance to oral clinical translation.OBJECTIVES: The current work focused on the application of DOE a modernstatistical optimization tool for the development and optimization of a solidlipid nanoparticle (SLN) formulation that can encapsulate hydrophilic andthermolabile Vinorelbine bitartrate (VRL) to a maximum extent withoutcompromising integrity and anticancer activity of the drug.METHODS: SLNs were prepared by solvent diffusion technique employing Taguchiorthogonal array design with optimized formulation and process variables. Theemulsifying nature and low melting point of glyceryl mono-oleate (GMO) wereexploited to enhance entrapment and minimizing temperature associateddegradation, respectively. Moreover, two types of surfactants, Vitamin E TPGS(TPGS) and Poloxamer-188 were utilized to obtain TPGS-VRL-SLNs and PL-VRL-SLNs,respectively. The SLNs were characterized for various physicochemical properties,in-vitro drug release kinetics and anticancer activity by MTT assay on MCF-7cancer cell lines.RESULTS: The SLNs were found to be spherical in shape with entrapment efficiency (EE) up to 58 %. In-vitro release studies showed biphasic release patternfollowing Korsemeyer peppas model with fickian release kinetics. Results of MTTassay revealed that TPGS-VRL-SLNs and PL-VRL-SLNs were 39.5 and 18.5 fold moreeffective, respectively, compared to the pristine VRL.CONCLUSION: DOE approach was successfully applied for the development ofVRL-SLNs. Enhanced entrapment and anticancer efficacy of TPGS-VRL-SLN can beattributed to emulsifying nature of GMO and inherent cytotoxic nature of TPGS,respectively, which synergizes with VRL. Therefore, TPGS associated SLNs may bepotential carrier in cancer chemotherapeutics.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1567201815666180409105410 PMID: 29629662
