[Epub ahead of print]Proportion of U.S. Trends in Breast Cancer Incidence Attributable to Long-termChanges in Risk Factor Distributions.Pfeiffer RM(1), Webb-Vargas Y(2), Wheeler W(3), Gail MH(4).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIHpfeiffer@mail.nih.gov.(2)Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School.(3)Information Management Services, Inc.(4)Biostatistics Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS.BACKGROUND: U.S. breast cancer incidence has been changing, as have distributionsof risk factors, including body mass index (BMI), age-at-menarche,age-at-first-live-birth and number of live births.METHODS: Using data for U.S. women from large nationally representative surveys, we estimated risk factor distributions from 1980-2008. To estimate ecologicassociations with breast cancer incidence, we fitted Poisson models to age- andcalendar-year-specific incidence data from the National Cancer Institute'sSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registries from 1980-2011. We thenassessed the proportion of incidence attributable to specific risk factors bycomparing incidence from models that only included age and calendar period aspredictors with models that additionally included age- and cohort-specificcategorized mean risk factors. Analyses were stratified by age and race.RESULTS: Ecologic associations usually agreed with previous findings fromanalytic epidemiology. From 1980-2011, compared to the risk factor referencelevel, increased BMI was associated with 7.6% decreased incidence in women aged40-44 and 2.6% increased incidence for women aged 55-59. Fewer births wereassociated with 22.2% and 3.99% increased incidence in women aged 40-44 and 55-59years, respectively. Changes in age at menarche and age-at-first-live-birth inparous women did not significantly impact population incidence from 1980-2011.CONCLUSIONS: Changes in BMI and number of births since 1980 significantlyimpacted U.S. breast cancer incidence.IMPACT: Understanding and quantifying long-term impact of risk factor trends onincidence is important to understand the future breast cancer burden and informprevention efforts.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0098 PMID: 30068516
