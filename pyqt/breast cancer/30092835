We generated an adenovirus encoding full length human HER3(Ad-HER3) to serve as a cancer vaccine. Previously we reported the anti-tumorefficacy and function of the T cell response to this vaccine. We now provide adetailed assessment of the antitumor efficacy and functional mechanisms of theHER3 vaccine-induced antibodies (HER3-VIAs) in serum from mice immunized withAd-HER3.METHODS: Serum containing HER3-VIA was tested in complement-dependentcytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays andfor its effect on HER3 internalization and degradation, downstream signaling ofHER3 heterodimers and growth of metastatic HER2+ (BT474M1), HER2therapy-resistant (rBT474), and triple negative (MDA-MB-468) breast cancers.RESULTS: HER3-VIAs mediated CDC and ADCC, HER3 internalization, interruption ofHER3 heterodimer-driven tumor signaling pathways, and anti-proliferative effects against HER2+ tumor cells in vitro and significant antitumor effects againstmetastatic HER2+ BT474M1, treatment refractory HER2+ rBT474 and triple negativeMDA-MB-468 in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the T cell anti-tumor response induced by Ad-HER3,the HER3-VIAs provide additional functions to eliminate tumors in which HER3signaling mediates aggressive behavior or acquired resistance to HER2-targetedtherapy. These data support clinical studies of vaccination against HER3 prior toor concomitantly with other therapies to prevent outgrowth of therapy-resistantHER2+ and triple negative clones.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1023-x PMID: 30092835
