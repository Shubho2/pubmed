Thus, anticancer prodrugs with prolonged systemic circulation, tumor-specific distribution and bioactivation, couldsignificantly strengthen the chemotherapy efficacy. Herein, we design two noveltumor cell reduction/oxidation-responsive docetaxel (DTX) prodrugs, DTX-maleimideconjugates with disulfide bond (DSSM) or thioether bond (DSM) linkages, toevaluate the roles of different sensitive linkages in drug release,pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy. An ester bond-linkage prodrug (DM) is utilized as a non-sensitive control. DSSM and DSM show reduction- oroxidation-sensitive release behavior, respectively, and exhibit hyperselectivebioactivation and cytotoxicities between cancerous and normal cells. They couldinstantly hitchhike blood circulating albumin after i.v. administration withalbumin-binding half-lives as short as 1 min, resulting in prolonged systemiccirculation, increased tumor accumulation. In response to the upregulatedreduction/oxidation environment within tumor cells, DSSM and DSM exhibitselectively release capacity in tumor tissues, their TAITumor/Liver values areover 30-fold greater than DM. Combining the above delivery advantages into one,DSSM and DSM achieve enhanced antitumor efficacy of DTX. Such a uniquelydeveloped strategy, integrating high albumin-binding capability andreduction/oxidation-sensitive drug superselective release in tumors, has greatpotential to be applied in clinical cancer therapy.Copyright © 2018.
