Few studies have compared the effects of peer education onbreast cancer knowledge among peer educators and the community members who aresubsequently reached through the peer education. Further, little is known as towhether those who received the education then go on to educate others in thecommunity. The purpose of this study is to address those gaps. Using a pre- andpost-test study design, we trained peer educators, provided the educators withresources to train community members, and assessed changes in knowledge. Wesought to train ten educators and recommended each train ten community members inbreast cancer knowledge and screening strategies. A total of 14 peer educatorswere trained, who subsequently trained a total of 121 community members, of whom 94 were African American women. Peer educators and community members, showedcomparable increases in knowledge. Community members who were educated alsoincreased intention to discuss breast cancer and breast cancer screening withtheir family, friends, and acquaintances. Our study suggests that it is feasible to train peer educators to increase knowledge among community members to the samelevel that they themselves experience when trained. Further, community membersare interested in sharing information learned related to how much they learn frompeer educators.DOI: 10.1007/s10900-018-0490-4 PMID: 29488155
