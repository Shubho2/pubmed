Monitoring thehost microenvironments in cancer plays a significant role in predicting prognosesand curative effects. It is important to clarify the role of immune related gene expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment. Inthis study, we evaluated the impact of chemotherapy with a TPD regimen, on immunemicro environments in HER2-positive breast cancer using immune related proteinsas indicators.METHODS: The subjects consisted of 30 patients who received the TPD regimen. The expression levels of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Ki67, CD8,forkhead box protein (FOXP) 3, programmed death (PD) 1, programmed death ligand(PD-L) 1, CD163, phosphatase and tensin homolog and lymphocyte activation gene 3 were evaluated in biopsy specimens, by immunostaining.RESULTS: CD8+, CD8/FOXP3 ratio (CFR)high and PD-L1- group had significantlylonger PFS than the CD8-, CFRlow and PDL1+ group (p = 0.045, log-rank)(p = 0.007, log-rank) (p = 0.040, log-rank), respectively. The CFRhigh group had significantly better OS than the CFRlow group (p = 0.034, log-rank). In theunivariate analysis, CD8+, CFRhigh groups extended PFS significantly (p = 0.027, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.162) (p = 0.008, HR = 0.195), respectively. The receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) analyses showed that the results for CFR [areaunder the curve (AUC): 0.708] were better than those for other factors (AUC:CD8 = 0.681, FOXP3 = 0.639, PD1 = 0.528, PD-L1 = 0.681).CONCLUSIONS: This study shows with the TPD regimen, a high CFR leads to a highORR and long PFS in HER2-positive breast cancer. CFR, therefore, may be one ofthe important prognostic factors for this disease.DOI: 10.1186/s12967-018-1460-4 PMCID: PMC5883877PMID: 29615076
