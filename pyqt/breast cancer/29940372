[Epub ahead of print]The Primo Vascular System as a possible exosomal route across the body:implications for tumour proliferation and metastasis.Ghiron C, Cat TY.This literature study paper will present the possibility of a correlation betweenthe Energy Meridians of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which can be tracedback to the recently described Primo Vessels (formerly known as Bong-Han ducts), their composition and the ability of tumours to proliferate and metastasise. Itis proposed that microvesicular bodies such as exosomes, known to be involved in cell-to-cell communication, immune response and tumour proliferation, could bemoving across the body via the Primo Vascular System. The ubiquity of the PrimoVascular System and its penetration through the blood-brain barrier could alsoexplain the ability of some peripheral tumours (e.g. breast tumour) tometastasise in the brain.Copyright Â© 2018.
