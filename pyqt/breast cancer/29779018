Modulation of genes,primarily within the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathways also act to extendlifespan in model organisms. For example, mice lacking insulin receptorsubstrate-1 (IRS1) are long-lived and protected against several age-associatedpathologies. However, it remains unclear how these particular interventions actmechanistically to produce their beneficial effects. Here, we investigatedtranscriptional responses in wild-type and IRS1 null mice fed an ad libitum diet (WTAL and KOAL) or fed a 30% DR diet (WTDR or KODR). Using an RNAseq approach we noted a high correlation coefficient of differentially expressed genes existedwithin the same tissue across WTDR and KOAL mice and many metabolic features wereshared between these mice. Overall, we report that significant overlap exists in the tissue-specific transcriptional response between long-lived DR mice and IRS1 null mice. However, there was evidence of disconnect between transcriptionalsignatures and certain phenotypic measures between KOAL and KODR, in thatadditive effects on body mass were observed but at the transcriptional level DRinduced a unique set of genes in these already long-lived mice.DOI: 10.18632/aging.101446 PMCID: PMC5990393PMID: 29779018
