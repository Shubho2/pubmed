The finding of an unexpected region ofFDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) uptake can occur when performing whole-body FDG-PET,raising the possibility of a second primary tumor. The aim of this study was toevaluate our experience of second primary cancer incidentally discovered duringPET/CT examination performed for pancreatic diseases, during the initial work-up or follow-up after surgical resection.METHODS: In this study, a retrospective evaluation of a prospectively collecteddata base was performed. Three hundred ninety- nine patients with pancreaticpathology were evaluated by whole body PET/CT imaging from January 2004 toDecember 2014. Among them, 348 patients were scanned before surgical resectionand 51 during the course of their follow-up (pancreatic cancer). Median follow-uptime was 29Â months (range 14-124).RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (14%) had incidental uptake of FDG in their organs:31 patients had focal uptake and 25 showed diffuse with or without focal uptake. All patients with focal uptake were investigated, and invasive malignancy wasdiagnosed in 22 patients: 14 colon, 4 lung, 1 larynx, 1 urothelial, 1 breastcancer, and 1 colon metastasis from pancreatic cancer. Twenty patients underwent resection, and 6 endoscopic removal of colonic polyps. Three patients were notoperated for advanced disease, and two patients did not show any pathology(PET/CT false positive). Of the 10 patients investigated for diffuse uptake, nomalignancy was found; none of these patients developed a second cancer during thefollow-up.CONCLUSIONS: As in other malignancies, unexpected FDG uptake can occur inpatients having PET/CT investigation for pancreatic diseases. Focal uptake islikely to be a malignancy and deserves further investigations, although the stageand the poor prognosis of primary pancreatic cancer should be kept in mind. Some selected patients may benefit from the aggressive treatment of incidental lesionsand show survival benefit.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4469-4 PMCID: PMC5936016PMID: 29728085
