A higher regucalcin expression in the tumortissues has been demonstrated to prolong the survival of patients with varioustypes of cancer, including pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer andlung adenocarcinoma. The involvement of regucalcin in human colorectal cancer wasinvestigated in the current study. Regucalcin gene expression and the survivaldata of 62 patients with colorectal cancer were obtained though the GeneExpression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE12945) for outcome analysis. The data ofgene expression revealed that the prolonged survival of patients with colorectal cancer was associated with a higher regucalcin gene expression in tumor tissues. The overexpression of regucalcin suppressed colony formation and proliferation,and induced the death of human colorectal carcinoma RKO cells cultured in amedium containing fetal bovine serum in vitro. Mechanistically, theoverexpression of regucalcin induced the G1 and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest ofthe RKO cells through the suppression of multiple signaling pathways, includingRas, Akt, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and SAPK/JNK. Of note, theoverexpression of regucalcin induced an increase in the levels of the tumorsuppressors, p53 and Rb, and the cell cycle inhibitor, p21. Moreover, the levels of the transcription factors, c‑fos, c‑jun, nuclear factor (NF)‑κB p65, β-cateninand signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), were suppressedby the overexpression of regucalcin. On the whole, the findings of this studysuggest that regucalcin plays a crucial role as a suppressor in human colorectal cancer, and that the suppressed expression of the regucalcin gene may predispose patients to the promotion of colorectal cancer. The overexpression of regucalcin by gene delivery may thus prove to be a novel therapeutic strategy for colorectalcancer.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4458 PMID: 29956741
