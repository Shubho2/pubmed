These observations raise the issue of whether management of breast cancer in certain settings should include consideration of reducing thepossible contribution of thyroid hormone to the advancement of the disease. In a preliminary experience, elimination of the clinical action of endogenousL-thyroxine (T4) in patients with advanced solid tumors, including breast cancer,has favorably affected the course of the cancer, particularly when coupled withadministration of exogenous 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) (euthyroidhypothyroxinemia). We discuss in the current brief review the possible clinicalsettings in which to consider whether endogenous thyroid hormone-or exogenousthyroid hormone in the patient with hypothyroidism and coincident breastcancer-is significantly contributing to breast cancer outcome.DOI: 10.1007/s12672-018-0326-9 PMCID: PMC5945724PMID: 29441459
