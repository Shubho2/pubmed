The objective of this study is to use performance management data from theConnecticut Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (CBCCEDP) todetermine whether race/ethnicity disparities exist in human papillomavirus (HPV) co-testing uptake across CBCCEDP contractors. Methods: Secondary analysis ofConnecticut's Minimum Data Elements data for 2013-2015 among 10 contractorsparticipating in the CBCCEDP. Participants included women aged 30-64 years andeligible to receive routine cervical cancer screening services through theCBCCEDP (n=5,262). HPV co-testing uptake was compared across contractors andrace/ethnicity groups within each contractor using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. Results: Overall, 62.9% of women received HPV co-testingservices. Significant differences in co-testing rates were detected betweenracial/ethnic groups when data were examined across all contractors (p<0.001).Black women were least likely to receive co-testing (49.1%), while Hispanic womenwere most likely to receive co-testing (68.2%). When data were examined at theindividual contractor level, significant differences between racial/ethnic groupswere observed in 50% of the contractors. Conclusions: This study identifiedracial/ethnic disparities in uptake of HPV co-testing both overall and withinindividual contractors involved in the CBCCEDP. These findings will be used toguide program improvement with the goal of increasing quality and consistency of care for all women seeking screening services.DOI: 10.1089/heq.2017.0038 PMCID: PMC5909280PMID: 29696243
