NCOAs play an important role in biology ofhormone-dependent and -independent cancers. MCB-613 is a recently described,small molecule stimulator of NCOAs and anti-neoplastic compound that leads to thedeath of tumour cells due to increased cellular stress. In the present study weinvestigated the molecular mechanism of MCB-613-induced cell death. We reportthat absence of NCOA3 leads to compromised activation of PERK signalling pathway during unfolded protein response (UPR). We found that chemical and geneticinhibition of NCOA3 attenuated the expression of PERK at mRNA and protein level. We show that loss of NCOA3 renders cells hypersensitive to UPR induced celldeath. Our results show that MCB-613 induced cell death is attenuated in NCOA3knockout HeLa cells and MCB-613 leads to enhanced PERK signalling in wild-typeHeLa cells. The knockdown of PERK provides resistance to MCB-613 mediated celldeath while knockdown of XBP1 and ATF6 have no such effect. Our results suggestthat hyperstimulation of NCOA3 by MCB-613 induces cell death by evokingconstitutive PERK signalling. Taken together our results point to NCOA3 as animportant determinant in regulating cell fate during ER stress, with too littleand too much NCOA3 both producing deleterious effects.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24451 PMCID: PMC5837751PMID: 29545931
