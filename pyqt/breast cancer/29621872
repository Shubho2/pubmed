All patients received 50 Gy in 25fractions. Planning target volume (PTV) parameters-Dnear-max (D2), Dnear-min(D98), Dmean, V95, and V107-homogeneity index (HI), and conformity index (CI)were compared. The mean doses of lung and heart, percentage volume of ipsilaterallung receiving 5 Gy (V5), 20 Gy (V20), and 55 Gy (V55) and that of heartreceiving 5 Gy (V5), 25 Gy (V25), and 45 Gy (V45) were extracted from dose-volumehistograms and compared.RESULTS: PTV parameters were comparable between the two groups. CI wassignificantly improved with IMRT (1.127 vs. 1.254, p < 0.001) but HI was similar (0.094 vs. 0.096, p = 0.83) compared to 3DCRT. IMRT in comparison to 3DCRTsignificantly reduced the high-dose volumes of lung (V20, 22.09% vs. 30.16%; V55,5.16% vs. 10.27%; p < 0.001) and heart (V25, 4.59% vs. 9.19%; V45, 1.85% vs.7.09%; p < 0.001); mean dose of lung and heart (11.39 vs. 14.22 Gy and 4.57 vs.8.96 Gy, respectively; p < 0.001) but not the low-dose volume (V5 lung, 61.48%vs. 51.05%; V5 heart, 31.02% vs. 23.27%; p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: For left sided breast cancer, IMRT significantly improves theconformity of plan and reduce the mean dose and high-dose volumes of ipsilateral lung and heart compared to 3DCRT, but 3DCRT is superior in terms of low-dosevolume.DOI: 10.3857/roj.2017.00381 PMCID: PMC5903359PMID: 29621872
