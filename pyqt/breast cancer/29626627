Epub 2018 Apr 4.Tangeretin inhibits the proliferation of human breast cancer cells viaCYP1A1/CYP1B1 enzyme induction and CYP1A1/CYP1B1-mediated metabolism to theproduct 4' hydroxy tangeretin.Surichan S(1), Arroo RR(1), Tsatsakis AM(2), Androutsopoulos VP(3).Author information: (1)De Montfort University, Leicester School of Pharmacy, The Gateway, LeicesterLE1 9BH, UK.(2)Laboratory of Toxicology, University of Crete, Medical School, Voutes,Heraklion 71409, Crete, Greece.(3)Laboratory of Toxicology, University of Crete, Medical School, Voutes,Heraklion 71409, Crete, Greece. Electronic address: androuts@uoc.gr.Tangeretin is a polymethoxylated flavone with multifaceted anticancer activity.In the present study, the metabolism of tangeretin was evaluated in the CYP1expressing human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 and in the normalbreast cell line MCF10A. Tangeretin was converted to 4' OH tangeretin byrecombinant CYP1 enzymes and by CYP1 enzymes expressed in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468cells. This metabolite was absent in MCF10A cells that did not express CYP1enzymes. Tangeretin exhibited submicromolar IC50 (0.25 ± 0.15 μM) in MDA-MB-468cells, whereas it was less active in MCF7 cells (39.3 ± 1.5 μM) and completelyinactive in MCF10A cells (>100 μM). In MDA-MB-468 cells that were coincubatedwith the CYP1 inhibitor acacetin, an approximately 70-fold increase was noted in the IC50 (18 ± 1.6 μM) of tangeretin. In the presence of the CYP1 inhibitoracacetin, the conversion of tangeretin to 4' OH tangeretin was significantlyreduced in MDA-MB-468 cells (2.55 ± 0.19 μM vs. 6.33 ± 0.12 μM). The mechanism ofantiproliferative action involved cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase for MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Tangeretin was further shown to induce CYP1 enzyme activity andCYP1A1/CYP1B1 protein expression in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells. These resultssuggest that tangeretin inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells viaCYP1A1/CYP1B1-mediated metabolism to the product 4' hydroxy tangeretin.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
