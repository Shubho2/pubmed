There is evidence that TNBCs often have increased expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ofosteopontin (OPN). OPN-mediated signaling can activate EGFR-dependent signalingpathways. Here, we assessed OPN as a potential predictive biomarker for response to anti-EGFR therapy in TNBC.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using two different TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231, we investigated the impact of stable expression of OPN on efficacy ofthe EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in vitro.RESULTS: We observed that breast cancer cells engineered to overexpress OPN aremore sensitive to growth inhibition by erlotinib than control cells. The level ofresponse was related to the level of OPN expression, possibly due to increasedphosphorylation status of EGFR Tyr1068.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that OPN expression levels are related tosensitivity of TNBC cells to growth inhibition by erlotinib. OPN thus is apromising predictive biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/14728222.2018.1502272 PMID: 30025479
