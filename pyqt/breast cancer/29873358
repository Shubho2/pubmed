Ru-tmxf displaysenhanced cellular uptake and PDT efficiency toward breast cancer cells with high ER expression due to the specific targeting of tamoxifen to ER and finallylocalizes in lysosomes. Moreover, Ru-tmxf can be activated by two-photonexcitation, generating 1O2 to damage lysosomes and result in cell death.DOI: 10.1039/c8cc03786h PMID: 29873358  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
