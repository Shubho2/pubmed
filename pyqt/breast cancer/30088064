Both ultra-fast DCE-MRI for initialenhancement analysis and conventional MRI were performed on 200 subjects with atotal of 215 lesions (147 malignant and 68 benign). BI-RADS categorisation ofenhancing lesions was performed using the conventional MRI. Two initialenhancement measures, time to enhancement (TTE) and maximum slope (MS), werederived from the ultra-fast DCE-MRI. Diagnostic performance and the additionaldiagnostic value of adding TTE and MS to BI-RADS were evaluated.RESULTS: Both TTE and MS showed significant differences between malignant andbenign breast lesions in masses (TTE, p <.001; MS, p = .006) and non-massenhancement (NME) (TTE, p <.001; MS, p <.001). For masses, the AUC of TTE+MScombined with BI-RADS (0.864) was better than BI-RADS alone (0.823, p = .065).For NME, the AUC of TTE+MS combined with BI-RADS (0.923) was significantly largerthan BI-RADS alone (0.865, p = .036), and diagnostic specificity improved by40.9% (p = .005), without a significant decrease in the sensitivity (p = .083).CONCLUSION: Initial enhancement analysis using ultra-fast DCE-MRI is especiallyuseful for increasing the diagnostic performance of NME in breast MRI.KEY POINTS: • Ultra-fast dynamic MRI effectively differentiates benign frommalignant breast lesions. • Ultra-fast dynamic MRI contributes to BI-RADScategorisation in non-mass enhancement. • Management of non-mass breast lesionsbecomes more appropriate.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5643-4 PMID: 30088064
