Current practice in Israel is to genotypefor the predominant BRCA1/2 mutations first, followed by full gene analysis ineligible mutation-negative individuals. This work assessed the rate ofnon-predominant mutations in BRCA1/2 in ethnically diverse high-risk cases.METHODS: Breast and/or ovarian cancer patients who tested negative for thepredominant BRCA1/2 mutations were referred for comprehensive BRCA1/2 genotyping if calculated risk for carrying a BRCA mutation was ≥ 10%.RESULTS: Of 1258 eligible patients, 41 (3.3%) carried one of 38 mutations: 3% of Ashkenazi Jews and 3.4% of mixed ethnicities. Detection rate was < 5% amongpatients diagnosed with cancer younger than 40 or with bilateral breast cancer,and was 5.5% of ovarian cancer patients. Three of the carriers (7.3%) carriedgene rearrangements. Three mutations were reported in more than one case.CONCLUSIONS: The overall yield of comprehensive BRCA1/2 testing in ethnicallydiverse high-risk Israeli individuals is 3.3%. This is lower than expected byprobability models. A slightly higher rate of BRCA1/2 carriers was seen amongovarian cancer cases. These data should guide BRCA1/2 optimal testing strategy inIsrael.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4887-7 PMID: 30014164
