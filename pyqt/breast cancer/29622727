We evaluate BRCA- carrier detectionrates in general and Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) populations across Greater London and estimate time-to-detection of all identifiable BRCA carriers.METHODS: BRCA carrier data from 1993 to 2014 were obtained from National HealthService genetic laboratories and compared with modelled predictions of BRCAprevalence from published literature and geographical data from UK Office forNational Statistics. Proportion of BRCA carriers identified was estimated.Prediction models were developed to fit BRCA detection rate data. BRCA carrieridentification rates were evaluated for an 'Angelina Jolie effect'. Maps for fourGreater London regions were constructed, and their relative BRCA detection rates were compared. Models developed were used to predict future time-to-identify all detectable BRCA carriers in AJ and general populations.RESULTS: Until 2014, only 2.6% (3072/111 742 estimated) general population and10.9% (548/4985 estimated) AJ population BRCA carriers have been identified in 16696 608 (AJ=190 997) Greater London population. 57% general population and 54% AJmutations were identified through cascade testing. Current detection rates mirrorlinear fit rather than parabolic model and will not identify all BRCA carriers.Addition of unselected ovarian/triple-negative breast cancer testing would take>250 years to identify all BRCA carriers. Doubling current detection rates canidentify all 'detectable' BRCA carriers in the general population by year 2181,while parabolic and triple linear rates can identify 'detectable' BRCA carriersby 2084 and 2093, respectively. The linear fit model can identify 'detectable' AJcarriers by 2044. We did not find an Angelina Jolie effect on BRCA carrierdetection rates. There was a significant difference in BRCA detection ratesbetween geographical regions over time (P<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The majority of BRCA carriers have not been identified, missing key opportunities for prevention/earlier diagnosis. Enhanced and newstrategies/approaches are needed.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018. All rights reserved.
