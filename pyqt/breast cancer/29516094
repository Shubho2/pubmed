However, the incidence of breast cancer in womenwith schizophrenia compared with the general population remains uncertain.Objective: To perform an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the associationbetween schizophrenia and the risk of breast cancer.Data Sources: A systematic search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases wasconducted using the search terms schizophrenia, schizophrenic, psychosis,combined with breast and cancer, tumor, neoplasm, or carcinoma. The finalliterature search was performed on August 15, 2017.Study Selection: Cohort studies reporting the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for the risk of breast cancer in women with schizophrenia compared with thegeneral population.Data Extraction and Synthesis: The meta-analysis adhered to Meta-analysis ofObservational Studies in Epidemiology and the Cochrane Handbook for SystematicReviews of Interventions. Data extraction was performed independently. Arandom-effects model was used to pool the results, and a recently proposedprediction interval was calculated to describe the heterogeneity.Main Outcomes and Measures: The SIR for the risk of breast cancer in women withschizophrenia compared with the general population or those withoutschizophrenia.Results: Twelve cohorts including 125 760 women were included in thismeta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that schizophrenia wasassociated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer incidence inwomen (SIR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.14-1.50; P < .001), with significant heterogeneity(P < .001; I2 = 89%). Substantial between-study variance was also suggested bythe wide prediction interval (0.81-2.10), which indicated that it is possiblethat a future study will show a decreased breast cancer risk in women withschizophrenia compared with the general population. The subgroup analysis resultsshowed that the association was not significantly affected by whether breastcancer cases were excluded at baseline or the sample size of the includedstudies.Conclusions and Relevance: The incidence of breast cancer in women withschizophrenia is higher than that of the general female population. However,significant heterogeneity exists among the included studies. Women withschizophrenia deserve intensive prevention and treatment of breast cancer.DOI: 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.4748 PMCID: PMC5875321 [Available on 2019-03-07]PMID: 29516094
