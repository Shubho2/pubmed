TCHDorganized its 12th annual conference focusing on "Evidence-Based Approaches toReduce Cancer Health Disparities: Discover, Develop, Deliver, and Disseminate."At this conference, experts in health care, biomedical sciences, and publichealth gathered to discuss the current status and strategies for reducing cancer health disparities. The meeting was conducted in three sessions on breast cancer,prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer disparities, in addition to roundtablediscussions and a poster session. Each session highlighted differences in theeffects of cancer, based on factors such as race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomicstatus, and geographical location. In each session, expert speakers presentedtheir findings, and this was followed by a discussion panel made up of experts inthat field and cancer survivors, who responded to questions from the audience.This article summarizes the approaches to fundamental, translational, clinical,and public health issues in cancer health disparities discussed at theconference.DOI: 10.4103/jcar.JCar_13_17 PMCID: PMC5883827PMID: 29643743
