Although enhanced tumor uptake was achieved inthese studies, elevated kidney accumulation also was observed, particularly with low-molecular-weight, single-domain antibody fragments (sdAbs). Here, wedeveloped an analogous agent (IB-Mal-d-GDDDK), in which glutamate residues (E)were replaced with aspartates (D) to determine whether this modification coulddecrease renal uptake. [125I]IB-Mal-d-GDDDK and [131I]IB-Mal-d-GEEEK weresynthesized with similar radiochemical yields (60⁻80%) and coupled to theanti-HER2 sdAb 5F7 at 50⁻60% efficiency. Paired-label internalization assays invitro indicated similar levels of intracellular activity residualization inHER2-expressing BT474M1 cells for [125I]IB-Mal-d-GDDDK-5F7 and[131I]IB-Mal-d-GEEEK-5F7. A paired-label biodistribution comparison of the twolabeled conjugates was performed in mice with HER2-expressing SKOV-3 xenografts, and the results of this study indicated that renal uptake at 1 h was 127.5 ±18.7% ID/g and 271.4 ± 66.6% ID/g for [125I]IB-Mal-d-GDDDK-5F7 and[131I]IB-Mal-d-GEEEK-5F7, respectively. The tumor uptake of the tworadioconjugates was not significantly different. These results demonstrate thatsubstitution of E with D in the IB-Mal-d-GEEEK construct reduced kidneyaccumulation of the sdAb. However, renal activity levels need to be reducedfurther if d-amino acid derived prosthetic agents are to be of practical valuefor labeling low molecular weight biomolecules such as sdAbs.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23051223 PMID: 29783774
