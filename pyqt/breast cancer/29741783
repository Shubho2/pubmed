Regarding the importance of angiogenesis in tumordevelopment and spreading, we decided to assign the anti-angiogenic effects ofCD73 suppression. We used chitosan lactate (ChLa) nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver CD73-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cancer cells. Our results showedthat treatment of the 4T1 cells with CD73-specific siRNA-loaded NPs led to potentinhibition of cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest, in vitro. Thisgrowth arrest was correlated with downregulation of angiogenesis-relatedmolecules including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-R2,interleukin (IL)-6, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Moreover,administration of NPs loaded with CD73-siRNA into 4T1 breast cancer-bearing mice led to tumor regression and increased mice survival time accompanied withdownregulation of angiogenesis (VEGF-A, VEGF-R2, VE-Cadherin, and CD31) andlymphangiogenesis (VEGF-C and LYVE-1)-related genes in the tumor site.Furthermore, the expression of angiogenesis promoting factors including IL-6,TGF-β, signal transducer, and activator of transcription (STAT)3, hypoxiainducible factor (HIF)-1α, and cyclooxygenase (COX)2 was decreased after the CD73suppression in mice. Moreover, analysis of leukocytes derived from the tumorsamples, spleen, and regional lymph nodes showed that they had lower capabilityfor secretion of angiogenesis promoting factors after CD73-silencing. Theseresults indicate that suppression of tumor development by downregulation of CD73 is in part related to angiogenesis arrest. These findings imply a promisingstrategy for inhibiting tumor growth accompanied with suppressing theangiogenesis process.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcp.26743 PMID: 29741783
