Threeblinded readers assessed the images from US, elastography, and color Dopplerimaging according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexiconindependently. Interobserver agreement was assessed, and sensitivity,specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curvevalues for each data set were compared. Pathologic results were referencestandards.RESULTS: The interobserver agreements were excellent (intraclass correlationcoefficients, 0.856 for US, 0.948 for elastography, and 0.864 for color Doppler).The specificity and accuracy of US with elastography were increased compared withUS alone or US with Doppler imaging without statistically significant differencesin sensitivity. The average area under the curve for US with elastography (0.869)was increased compared with US alone (0.650) or US with color Doppler (0.576).CONCLUSIONS: Elastography is more useful than color Doppler imaging fordistinguishing small, oval, or round triple-negative breast cancer fromfibroadenoma, and elastography can help avoid biopsy of benign masses.© 2018 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/jum.14564 PMID: 29424448
