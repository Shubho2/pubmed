We aimed to validate the IBTR! 2.0 using anexternal data set. Materials and.METHODS: The cohort consisted of 2,206 patients, who received breast conservingsurgery and radiation therapy from 1992 to 2012 at our institution, where widesurgical excision is been routinely performed. Discrimination and calibrationwere used for assessing model performance. Patients with predicted 10-year IBTRrisk based on an IBTR! 2.0 nomogram score of &lt;3%, 3%-5%, 5%-10%, and &gt;10%were assigned to groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. We also plotted calibrationvalues to observe the actual IBTR rate against the nomogram-derived 10-year IBTR probabilities.RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 73 months (range, 6 to 277 months). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.607, showing pooraccordance between the estimated and observed recurrence rate. Calibration plotconfirmed that the IBTR! 2.0 nomogram predicted the 10-year IBTR risk higher thanthe observed IBTR rates in all groups. High discrepancies between nomogram IBTRpredictions and observed IBTR rates were observed in overall risk groups.Compared with the original development dataset, our patients had fewer high gradetumors, less margin positivity, and less lymphovascular invasion, and more use ofmodern systemic therapies. Conclusions: IBTR! 2.0 nomogram seems to have themoderate discriminative ability with a tendency to over-estimating risk rate.Continued efforts are needed to ensure external applicability of publishednomograms by validating the program using an external patient population.DOI: 10.3857/roj.2018.00059 PMID: 29983034
