Thispaper presents the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study ofthe specific targeting and entry of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone(LHRH)-conjugated PEG-coated magnetite nanoparticles into triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and normal breast cells. The conjugated nanoparticlesstructures, cellular uptake of PEG-coated magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) andLHRH-conjugated PEG-coated magnetite nanoparticles (LHRH-MNPs) into breast cancercells and normal breast cells were investigated using a combination oftransmission electron microscope, optical and confocal fluorescence microscopytechniques. The results show that the presence of LHRH enhances the uptake ofLHRH-MNPs into TNBC cells. Nanoparticle entry into breast cancer cells is alsostudied using a combination of thermodynamics and kinetics models. The trends in the predicted nanoparticle entry times (into TNBC cells) and the size ranges ofthe engulfed nanoparticles (within the TNBC cells) are shown to be consistentwith experimental observations. The implications of the results are thendiscussed for the specific targeting of TNBCs with LHRH-conjugated PEG-coatedmagnetite nanoparticles for the early detection and treatment of TNBC.Copyright © 2018.
