A confluence of forces is driving the demand for the personalizationof cancer screening recommendations. Recommendations are increasingly based onindividual patient preferences, medical history, genetic and environmental riskfactors, and level of interaction with the healthcare system. Current examplesinclude choices between colonoscopy, fecal testing, and emerging tests forcolorectal cancer (CRC) screening; the use of genetic information andavailability of home self-testing in cervical cancer screening; the integrationof multiple risk factors and patient preferences to decide the intensity andlength of breast cancer screening; and the issues of smoking cessation andcompeting priorities when deciding whether or not to pursue lung cancerscreening. These changes will inevitably increase the burden on primary care ofproviding high-quality cancer screening to their patients. To address, primarycare physicians need access to continuously updated evidence reviews includingprioritization of strongly supported recommendations, training in shareddecision-making and tools for preference diagnosis, and an electronic healthrecord (EHR) and reimbursement model that allow for population health management and team-based care. Only by reinforcing cancer screening in primary care can we ensure that personalized cancer screening is accessible and evidence-based.DOI: 10.1186/s40985-018-0083-x PMCID: PMC5820801PMID: 29484218
