However,the potential targets of CSCs are expressed at low levels in the natural stateand are always changing. Thus, dynamic screening has been reported to be aneffective measure for exploring CSC markers. In recent years, diversesingle-chain variable fragments (scFvs) have been widely used in immunotherapy.In this study, we determined that the scFvs, screened using RD, had a highaffinity to microspheres and could inhibit their progression. We also observedthat the selected scFvs underwent evolution in vitro, and antitumor-associatedproteins were successfully expressed. Combined with chemotherapy, the scFvs had asynergistic effect on the inhibition of the microspheres' progression in vitroand in vivo, which could be ascribed to their high affinity for stem-like cellsand the inhibition of the microspheres' collective behaviors. In addition,proteins inhibiting CD44+ /CD24+ and MAPK were involved. Our data indicated that dynamic screening of the scFvs in a natural state was of great significance inthe inhibition of the microspheres in vitro and in vivo.Â© 2018 The Authors.
