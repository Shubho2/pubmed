Associations were quantified usingrandom-effects models. Heterogeneity was investigated through subgroup analysesand the Q-test and I2 statistics.RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were reviewed. We observed a trend between higherlevels of physical activity and higher levels of global DNA methylation (pooledstandardized mean difference=0.19; 95% CI:-0.03-0.40; p=0.09) which, in turn, hada suggestive association with a reduced breast cancer risk (pooled relativerisk=0.70; 95% CI:0.49-1.02; p=0.06). In subgroup analyses, a positiveassociation between physical activity and global DNA methylation was observedamong studies assessing physical activity over long periods of time (p=0.02).Similarly, the association between global DNA methylation and breast cancer wasstatistically significant for prospective cohort studies (p=0.007).CONCLUSIONS: Despite the heterogeneous evidence base, the literature suggeststhat physical activity reduces the risk of breast cancer through increased globalDNA methylation.IMPACT: This study is the first to systematically overview the complete biologic pathway between physical activity, global DNA methylation, and breast cancer.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0175 PMID: 29991518
