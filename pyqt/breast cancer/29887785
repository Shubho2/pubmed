A Review.Wirtz P(1)(2), Baumann FT(1).Author information: (1)Department I of Internal Medicine, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne Bonn,University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.(2)German Sport University Cologne, Cologne, Germany.The current scientific field of exercise interventions in breast cancer is verylarge. Rehabilitation focuses on restoring or improving quality of life and thus on independence and participation in life. Hence, it is important to investigate exercise interventions in the setting of rehabilitation and aftercare. It is alsonecessary to determine the influence of physical activity or exercise therapy on the prevention of recurrence and mortality as well as on certain side effects of the disease and its medical treatment in rehabilitation. Physical activity inrehabilitation and aftercare is feasible and safe and can be used for variouspurposes. Against the background of reduced fatigue, chemotherapy-inducedperipheral neuropathy, cancer-related cognitive impairment, arthralgia,lymphedema, recurrence, and mortality, as well as improved quality of life,different methodological approaches and evidence can be seen. Although theoverall data availability has increased, there are gaps in study documentation aswell as inadequate verification of scientific approaches in rehabilitationclinics and in everyday life.DOI: 10.1159/000488717 PMCID: PMC5981588 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29887785
