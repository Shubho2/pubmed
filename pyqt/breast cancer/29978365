We sought to evaluate national patterns ofcare in axillary surgery, and its association with overall survival (OS) amongwomen with N2-3 invasive breast cancer.METHODS: Women (18-90 years) with clinical N2-3 invasive breast cancer whounderwent axillary surgery were identified from the National Cancer Data Base(NCDB) from 2004 to 2013. Axillary surgery was categorized as sentinel lymph nodebiopsy (SLNB, 1-5 nodes) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND, ≥ 10 nodes).Patient and treatment characteristics, trends over time, and overall survival(OS) were compared by surgical treatment.RESULTS: Overall, 22,156 patients were identified. At diagnosis, 68.5% had cN2and 31.5% had cN3 disease. Treatment included: lumpectomy (27%), mastectomy(73%), adjuvant chemotherapy (53.4%), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) (39.7%),radiation (74%), and endocrine therapy (54.4%). In total, 9.9% (n = 2190)underwent SLNB and 90.1% (n = 19,966) underwent ALND. Receipt of SLNB wasassociated with private insurance, grade 3 disease, invasive ductal cancer, NAC, and lumpectomy (all p < 0.001). After adjustment for known covariates, including chemotherapy use, ALND was associated with improved survival [hazard ratio (HR)0.68, p < 0.001] and this effect was similar for N2 and N3 patients (axillarysurgery × cN-stage interaction p = 0.29).CONCLUSIONS: Axillary lymphadenectomy was associated with improved survival inpatients presenting with clinical N2-3 invasive breast cancer. Further studies,particularly in the neoadjuvant setting, are needed to identify breast cancerpatients with advanced nodal disease who may safely avoid a lesser extent ofaxillary surgery.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6587-2 PMID: 29978365
