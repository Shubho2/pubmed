Despite a number ofstudies being conducted, the effective mechanism for treating cancer has not yet been fully understood. The tumor-microenvironment such as hypoxia, low nutrients could disturb function of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to maintain cellularhomeostasis, ultimately leading to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in ER,so-called ER stress. The ER stress has a close relation with cancer. ER stressinitiates unfolded protein response (UPR) to re-establish ER homeostasis as anadaptive pathway in cancer. However, persistent ER stress triggers the apoptotic pathway. Therefore, blocking the adaptive pathway of ER stress or facilitatingthe apoptotic pathway could be an anti-cancer strategy. Recently, naturalproducts and their derivatives have been reported to have anti-cancer effects viaER stress. Here, we address mechanisms of ER stress-mediated apoptosis andhighlight strategies for cancer therapy by utilizing ER stress. Furthermore, wesummarize anti-cancer activity of the natural products via ER stress in six majortypes of cancers globally (lung, breast, colorectal, gastric, prostate and liver cancer). This review deepens the understanding of ER stress mechanisms in majorcancers as well as the suppressive impact of natural products against cancers viaER stress.DOI: 10.3390/nu10081021 PMID: 30081573
