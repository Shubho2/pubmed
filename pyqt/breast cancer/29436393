We hypothesized that factors present in thehuman tumor microenvironment (TME) drive drug resistance. Screening of a library of recombinant secreted microenvironmental proteins revealed fibroblast growthfactor 2 (FGF2) as a potent mediator of resistance to anti-estrogens, mTORC1inhibition, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition in ER+ breast cancer.Phosphoproteomic analyses identified ERK1/2 as a major output of FGF2 signalingvia FGF receptors (FGFRs), with consequent up-regulation of Cyclin D1 anddown-regulation of Bim as mediators of drug resistance. FGF2-driven drugresistance in anti-estrogen-sensitive and -resistant models, includingpatient-derived xenografts, was reverted by neutralizing FGF2 or FGFRs. Atranscriptomic signature of FGF2 signaling in primary tumors predicted shorterrecurrence-free survival independently of age, grade, stage, and FGFRamplification status. These findings delineate FGF2 signaling as a ligand-baseddrug resistance mechanism and highlights an underdeveloped aspect of precisiononcology: characterizing and treating patients according to their TMEconstitution.Â© 2018 Shee et al.DOI: 10.1084/jem.20171818 PMCID: PMC5839765 [Available on 2018-09-05]PMID: 29436393
