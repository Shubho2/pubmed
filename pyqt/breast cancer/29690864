Theprognosis of women with RASB is poor and there is no standardized therapy forthis type of malignancy.CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 54 year old woman with RASB (poorlydifferentiated angiosarcoma of the left breast; pT1, pNX, M0, L0, V0) and ahistory of invasive-ductal cancer of the left breast (pT1b, G2, pN0, ER positive,PR positive, HER-2/neu negative) treated in July 2012 with breast-conservingsurgery, adjuvant chemotherapy with 6 cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, adjuvant irradiation of the left breast with 50 Gray, and adjuvant endocrinetherapy with an aromatase inhibitor. In August 2016, a bilateralsalpingo-oophorectomy was performed to remove a tumor of the left ovary, whichwas diagnosed as breast cancer recurrence. At the same time, a small, purple skinlesion of 1.2 cm in diameter was noted in the inner upper quadrant of the rightbreast. RASB was diagnosed by punch biopsy and the tumor was excised with clearmargins. Imaging studies showed no evidence of further metastases. A systemicchemotherapy with 6 cycles of liposomal doxorubicin was initiated. Five monthslater, a local recurrence of RASB was diagnosed and mastectomy was performed. Sixmonths later, the patient is alive with no evidence of disease. Three hundredseven cases of RASB were identified. The pooled incidence rate of RASB was 1/3754women. The most common treatment of RASB was mastectomy in 83% of cases. Adjuvantradiotherapy or chemotherapy were rarely used with 6 and 4%, respectively,whereas in case of recurrence, chemotherapy was the mainstay of treatment, usedin 58% of cases. Radiotherapy and repeated surgery were also common with 30 and33% of cases, respectively. Overall, the prognosis of women with RASB was poorand the recurrence-free survival was short with a mean of 15.9 months. Meanoverall survival was 27.4 months.CONCLUSION: RASB is a rare late complication of breast irradiation. The prognosisof women with RASB is poor. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for localizeddisease while systemic chemotherapy and re-irradiation are appropriate for women with disseminated or recurrent RASB.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4369-7 PMCID: PMC5916720PMID: 29690864
