Epub 2018 Apr 6.Time to redefine the intramammary lymph node as a separate entity?Green M(1), Tafazal H(1), Swati B(1), Vidya R(1).Author information: (1)Department of Breast Surgery, Royal Wolverhampton Hospital, Wolverhampton,WV10 0QP, United Kingdom.The lymphatic drainage for the majority of primary breast tumors is to theaxillary lymph nodes (ALNs). Some, however, drain to the so-called extra-axillarybasins, namely the internal mammary, supra- and infraclavicular regions. Another potential drainage route includes the intramammary lymph nodes (IMLNs). Currentguidance suggests IMLNs should be considered as part of the axillary group,potentially affecting axillary management. However, due to evolution in imagingand advancement in technology, IMLNs may now be distinguished more accuratelypre-operatively. There are currently no published guidelines for the managementof IMLNs in the United Kingdom. The authors suggest that it is time to reclassifyIMLNs as a separate focus of cancer and treat it as a separate entity.
