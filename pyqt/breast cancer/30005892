However, no detailed evaluation of these deadlines has been carried out in Morocco. The aim of this study was to determine the waiting times of medical careof breast cancer in a national tertiary referral center. The study was carriedout by retrospective analysis of 373 cases of patients randomly selected amongthe cases recruited during the year 2015. Twelve delays of the care pathway were evaluated. The mean age was of 50,7 years. The deadline of access to this center was 9±8days. The deadline of access to the diagnosis was 33.5±21.2 days. Thedeadlines of access to multidisciplinary team meeting pre-therapeutic was20.4±16.9 days. The access to the first treatment was 51.1±34.3 days for theneoadjuvant chemotherapy and 75.5±34.8 days for surgery. The deadline of accessto the postoperative therapeutic proposal was on average 49.2±25.2 days. Thedeadline of access to the postoperative chemotherapy was 83.7±28.8 days and284±43.8 days for postoperative radiotherapy in case of adjuvant chemotherapy.The global deadline mammography-radiotherapy was 372±66.5 days. Many of ourdeadlines were long compared to international recommendations. The factorsassociated with these delays must be analyzed in order to introduce improvementmeasures to control these indicators.Copyright © 2018 Société Française du Cancer.
