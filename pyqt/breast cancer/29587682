Biomarkers related to insulin resistance mayhelp explain this negative association. Weight loss is associated withimprovements in insulin sensitivity. Our goal was to identify the impact of abehaviorally based weight loss intervention on indices of insulin resistance.METHODS: Overweight, early stage breast cancer survivors who completed initialcancer therapy were enrolled in a 6 month behaviorally based weight lossintervention that included calorie reduction, exercise and behavior modification.Biomarkers related to insulin resistance were obtained at baseline and after the intervention. Results from participants who achieved ≥5% weight loss werecompared to those who lost less weight.RESULTS: Despite not having diabetes as a preexisting diagnosis prior to thestudy, 69% of all participants were considered to have pre-diabetes or diabetesat baseline based on American Diabetes Association definitions. Participants who achieved ≥5% weight loss had significantly lower fasting insulin, AUC insulin,and insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR. Beta cell function decreased asanticipated when insulin resistance improved. Additionally, leptin levelsdeclined.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer survivors who achieved ≥5% weight loss demonstratedsignificant improvements in indices of insulin resistance. Despite an exclusioncriteria of diabetes at the time of enrolment, a high proportion met criteria forpre-diabetes or diabetes at baseline. Pre-diabetes appears to be under recognizedin overweight breast cancer survivors. Behaviorally based weight lossinterventions can result in weight loss and improvements in biomarkers related tobreast cancer outcomes and additionally may decrease the chance of developingdiabetes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01482702 4/12/2010 (retrospectively registered). https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01482702?term=Dittus&rank=4.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4272-2 PMCID: PMC5872579PMID: 29587682
