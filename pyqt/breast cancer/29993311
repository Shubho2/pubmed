Despite a higher accumulation ofTween-60 niosomes in tumor, the Span 60 formulation showed the highest antitumor efficacy when compared with the free drug (71.7 and 20.3% inhibition in tumorgrowth, respectively).CONCLUSION: Direct intratumoral injection of theranostic niosomes withappropriate composition could be a powerful tool for combined multimodal imaging and therapy.DOI: 10.2217/nnm-2018-0091 PMID: 29993311
