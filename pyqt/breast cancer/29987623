CAC isalso currently being used as a screening test in specific subgroups ofindividuals, particularly in some Asian countries. Although this has yieldedvaluable insights on the determinants and pathophysiology of CVD, whether thisapproach results in improved clinical outcomes compared to other assessment andmanagement approaches is currently unclear. Although CAC and mammograms share anumber of characteristics, there are also important conceptual differences. Theevidence supporting CAC, which is a robust CVD risk assessment tool, for CVDscreening purposes is currently very limited, and further research is needed.DOI: 10.1007/s11886-018-1020-9 PMID: 29987623
