This unusual presentation is more common inimmunosuppressed patients. Complications such as hepatitis, encephalitis, andpneumonitis are more likely in individuals with disseminated varicella zostervirus infection.A 63-year-old woman being treated for breast cancer developedmultiple pustules and vesicles days after starting doxorubicin andcyclophosphamide chemotherapy. Ten individual lesions appeared on her chest,abdomen, back, and leg. Non-dermatomal disseminated herpes zoster was suspected. She was treated with oral antiviral therapy, as well as with oral and topicalantibiotics. Varicella zoster virus infection was confirmed by direct fluorescentantibody staining. After one month, her skin lesions had resolved and she resumedchemotherapy.In a setting of immunosuppression, the rare presentation ofdisseminated herpes zoster without dermatome should be considered. Appropriateantiviral therapy should be administered while waiting for confirmation of thediagnosis, so as to reduce the risk of visceral dissemination of the varicellazoster virus infection.PMID: 29469780  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
