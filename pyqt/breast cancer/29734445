[Epub ahead ofprint]A Multicenter Analysis Examining Patients Undergoing Conversion of Implant-based Breast Reconstruction to Abdominally based Free Tissue Transfer.Zhao R(1), Tran BNN(2), Doval AF(2), Broadwater G(3), Buretta KJ(1), Orr JP(1),Lee BT(2), Hollenbeck ST(1).Author information: (1)Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.(2)Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, BethIsrael Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.(3)Biostatistics, Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, North Carolina.BACKGROUND:  Breast implant placement is the most common method forpostmastectomy reconstruction. For patients who develop complications associated with implant-based reconstruction, additional surgeries may be challenging. This study examined implant-based reconstruction failure in patients undergoingsalvage with abdominal free tissue transfer.METHODS:  We conducted an Institutional Review Board approved, multicenterretrospective study of patients with implant-based primary breast reconstruction followed by implant removal and subsequent abdominal free tissue transfer between2006 and 2016. Patient demographics, treatment details, and complications wereevaluated. Severity of implant failure was graded as either (1) not severe(delayed salvage reconstruction) or (2) severe (immediate salvagereconstruction).RESULTS:  Between 2006 and 2016, 115 patients with 180 mastectomy defectsunderwent primary implant-based reconstruction with subsequent implant removaland abdominally based free tissue reconstruction. Of these, 68 were delayed and47 were immediate salvage reconstruction. Factors leading to elective removalwere capsular contracture, asymmetry, and implant malposition. Factors leading toobligatory removal were infection, delayed wound healing, and implant extrusion. Postmastectomy radiation was significantly associated with immediate salvagereconstruction (p < 0.001, odds ratio = 3.9) as were large volume implants(p = 0.06). Deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps comprised 78.3% of allabdominally based free tissue reconstructions, while muscle-sparing transverserectus abdominus myocutaneous flaps comprised 18.3%. Overall flap failure ratewas 2.6% (2.94% delayed and 2.13% immediate salvage reconstruction; p = 1.0).CONCLUSION:  Our findings suggest that abdominal free tissue transfer remains asafe and effective salvage modality for implant-based breast reconstructionfailure. Patients with severe implant failure were more likely to have receivedradiation. Surgeons should remain cognizant of this during care of patients.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.DOI: 10.1055/s-0038-1641680 PMID: 29734445
