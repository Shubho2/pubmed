[Epub ahead of print]The Efficacy of Direct Mail, Patient Navigation, and Incentives for IncreasingMammography and Colonoscopy in the Medicaid Population: A Randomized ControlledTrial.Slater JS(1), Parks MJ(2), Nelson CL(2), Hughes KD(2).Author information: (1)Minnesota Department of Health, Cancer Control Section, St. Paul, Minnesota.jsslater33com@gmail.com.(2)Minnesota Department of Health, Cancer Control Section, St. Paul, Minnesota.Background: Despite lower cancer screening rates and survival rates in theMedicaid population compared with those with private insurance, there is a dearthof population-based, evidence-based interventions targeting Medicaid clients toaddress this problem.Methods: This study reports results of a population-basedrandomized controlled trial (RCT) among all individuals enrolled in Minnesota'sMedicaid program who were overdue for breast cancer (n = 22,113) and/orcolorectal cancer (n = 94,294) screening. Individuals were randomized tointervention or control groups. The intervention group received persuasive andinnovative direct mail materials coupled with a $20 incentive for using theirMedicaid benefit to get screened. Direct mail materials provided a phone numberto a call center staffed by patient navigators who addressed barriers andscheduled appointments via three-way calls. The control group received theintervention 15 months later. Primary outcomes were completion of mammography or colonoscopy within 12 weeks of the intervention. Billing claims served asevidence of screening.Results: Multivariate logistic regression showedsignificant differences for both breast cancer (P < 0.001) and colorectal cancer (P < 0.01). The odds of receiving a mammogram for the treatment group weresignificantly higher than the control group [OR = 1.30; 95% confidence interval(95% CI) = 1.16-1.46], and the treatment group was more likely to receive acolonoscopy than the control group (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.04-1.21).Conclusions:This population-based intervention increased breast cancer and colorectal cancer screening in a Medicaid population overdue for screening.Impact: These findingsmay have broad application for reaching individuals who generally remain outside the health care system despite having public health insurance.
