To streamlinemorphometric profiling, we developed OrganoSeg, an open-source software thatintegrates segmentation, filtering, and analysis for archived brightfield images of 3D culture. OrganoSeg is more accurate and flexible than existing platforms,and we illustrate its potential by stratifying 5167 breast-cancer spheroid and5743 colon and colorectal-cancer organoid morphologies. Organoid transcriptsgrouped by morphometric signature heterogeneity were enriched for biologicalprocesses not prominent in the original RNA sequencing data. OrganoSeg enablescomplete, objective quantification of brightfield phenotypes, which may giveinsight into the molecular and multicellular mechanisms of organoid regulation.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-017-18815-8 PMCID: PMC5871765PMID: 29593296
