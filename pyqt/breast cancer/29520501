The National Comprehensive Cancer Networkguidelines recommend providing CRRM to women with BRCA mutations who desire CRRM after risk-reduction counseling. However, in Japan, CRRM cannot be performedgenerally because it is not covered by health insurance. Thus, we conducted afeasibility study to confirm the safety of CRRM.METHODS: CRRM with bilateral breast reconstructions were performed for breastcancer patients with BRCA mutations. The primary endpoint was early adverseevents within 3 months, and secondary endpoints were late adverse events.RESULTS: Between August 2014 and November 2016, ten patients were enrolled. Themedian age was 37.5 years, and five of the patients had the BRCA1 mutation while five had the BRCA2 mutation. Six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Eight patients selected silicone breast implants, and two patients selectedtransverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap reconstruction. Pathologicalfindings showed no evidence of occult breast cancers in any of the patients. At amedian of 25.5 months follow-up time, CRRM-related early adverse events werehematoma (subsequently removed by re-operation; grade 2, n = 1), wound infection (grade 2, n = 1), skin ulceration (grade 1, n = 2) and wound pain (grade 1,n = 1). Overall, there were no grade 3 or more severe adverse events.CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that CRRM with reconstruction could be performed safely.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0850-z PMID: 29520501
