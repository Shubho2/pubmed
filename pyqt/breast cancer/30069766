Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.During the last decades, much has been learned about with cyclin-dependentkinases (CDK) playing a pivotal role in the cell cycle regulation. CDK4/6 is the key regulator of the G1-S transition. Palbociclib (PD 0332991, Ibrance®) is thefirst oral CDK4/6 inhibitor showing a substantially improved medianprogression-free survival (PFS) in advanced estrogen receptor (ER) positive andhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. This PFS prolongation was seen both with letrozole as first-line therapy (24.8 vs.14.5 months [PALOMA 2]) and with fulvestrant in endocrine pretreated patients(9.2 vs. 3.8 months [PALOMA-3]). The main toxicity is neutropenia due to cellcycle arrest which can be easily managed with dose interruption or dose reductionleading to a favorable safety profile with delayed deterioration of globalquality of life (QoL). Palbociclib is approved by the Federal Drug Administration(FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for ER-positive/HER2-negativeadvanced breast cancer. Despite the well-understood mode of action ofpalbociclib, predictive biomarkers are not yet defined. In conclusion, inhibitionof CDK4/6 using palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy is an efficientand well-tolerated treatment option in ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating the role of palbociclib inearly breast cancer as well as in other types of cancer.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-91442-8_11 PMID: 30069766
