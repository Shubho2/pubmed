Some, such as those of lung, breast, and kidney, are morelikely to metastasise to the jaw. We have therefore analysed the clinical andepidemiological characteristics of patients with metastatic tumours. We retrievedthe notes of 4 478 patients with metastatic tumours to the jawbones who weretreated in the Clinical Hospital Centre Dubrava in Zagreb, Croatia, during the 15years 2002-17 and made a retrospective analysis of patients' age, sex, site ofprimary tumour, site and clinical presentation of the metastases, time intervalsince diagnosis of the primary tumour and oral metastases, and time interval fromdiagnosis of oral metastases to death. Of the 10 who were diagnosed withmetastases to the jaw, there were four male and six female patients (mean age 57 (range 51-84) years) and the most common primary tumours were kidney (n=5), lung (n=2), breast (n=1), colon (n=1) and unknown (n=1). The mandible was more oftenaffected (n=7) than the maxilla (n=3), and the most common histological type was adenocarcinoma (n=6). The primary tumour in most of the patients (n=7) wasdiagnosed before the oral metastatic lesion. A metastasis in the jaw was thefirst sign of metastatic tumour in three patients, and in one case the metastasisand the primary tumour were diagnosed at the same time. Most of the patients had some oral problems. The time intervals from diagnosis of an oral metastasis todeath varied from one month - five years. Because of the rarity of thepresentation, the diagnosis of an oral metastatic lesion remains challenging, so metastases in the jaw should be suspected in every patient with such cancers and lesions in the jaw.Copyright Â© 2018 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.Published by Elsevier Ltd.
