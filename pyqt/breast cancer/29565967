Tounderstand the major biological functions of thousands ceRNA genes as a whole, wedesigned Model-based Analysis of Competing-endogenous Pathways (MACPath) to inferpathways co-regulated through ceRNA mechanism (cePathways). Our analysis onbreast tumors suggested that NGF (nerve growth factor)-induced tumor cellproliferation might be associated with tumor-related growth factor pathwaysthrough ceRNA. MACPath also identified indirect cePathways, whose ceRNArelationship is mediated by mediating ceRNAs. Finally, MACPath identifiedmediating ceRNAs that connect the indirect cePathways based on efficient integer linear programming technique. Mediating ceRNAs are unexpectedly enriched in tumorsuppressor genes, whose down-regulation is suspected to disrupt indirectcePathways, such as between DNA replication and WNT signaling pathways.Altogether, MACPath is the first computational method to comprehensivelyunderstand functions of thousands ceRNA genes, both direct and indirect, at thepathway level.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006074 PMCID: PMC5882149PMID: 29565967  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
