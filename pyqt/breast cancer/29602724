Sixty-onepatients who subsequently developed breast cancer were matched 1:2 by age andhigh-risk indication with patients who did not develop breast cancer (n = 122).Five fellowship-trained breast radiologists independently recorded the BPE. Themedian reader BPE for each case was calculated and compared between the cancerand control cohorts.RESULTS: Cancer cohort patients were high-risk because of a history of radiation therapy (10%, 6 of 61), high-risk lesion (18%, 11 of 61), or breast cancer (30%, 18 of 61); BRCA mutation (18%, 11 of 61); or family history (25%, 15 of 61).Subsequent malignancies were invasive ductal carcinoma (64%, 39 of 61), ductalcarcinoma in situ (30%, 18 of 61) and invasive lobular carcinoma (7%, 4of 61).BPE was significantly higher in the cancer cohort than in the control cohort(P = 0.01). Women with mild, moderate, or marked BPE were 2.5 times more likelyto develop breast cancer than women with minimal BPE (odds ratio = 2.5, 95%confidence interval: 1.3-4.8, P = .005). There was fair interreader agreement(κ = 0.39).CONCLUSIONS: High-risk women with greater than minimal BPE at screening MRI have increased risk of future breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.
