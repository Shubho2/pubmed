Electronic address: r_konwar@cdri.res.in.This a response to the commentary article entitled "The association betweenInterleukin-1β gene rs1143634 polymorphism and the risk of breast cancer" by Bei Wang, Fenlai Yuan. We completely agree with Wang and Yuan that there issignificant deviation of HWE in control subjects for IL-1beta exon 5 +3954polymorphism. Therefore, the apparent genetic association in IL-1beta exon 5+3954 polymorphism must be used cautiously for further interpretation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
