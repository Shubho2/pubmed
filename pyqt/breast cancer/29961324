China.MicroRNA-155 (miR-155), which facilitates breast tumor growth and invasion bypromoting tumor cell proliferation and inhibiting cell apoptosis, is consideredan ideal early diagnostic and prognostic marker. Herein, we developed aself-assembled hybridization chain reaction (HCR)-based photoacoustic (PA)nanoprobe for highly sensitive in situ monitoring of dynamic changes in miR-155expression during breast tumorigenesis and chemotherapy. The PA nanoprobes(Au-H1/PEG and Au-H2/PEG) were constructed by linking poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)and two hairpin DNA strands (H1 and H2, respectively) to the surface of goldnanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of miR-155, the PA nanoprobesself-assembled into Au aggregates via HCR between H1, H2, and miR-155. Thedecreased interparticle distance in these aggregates enhanced the surface plasmonresonance (SPR) in the AuNPs. Consequently, the absorption peak of the PAnanoprobes red-shifted, and strong PA signals were generated. This strategyenabled the sensitive and quantitative detection of miR-155 with a low detection limit of 0.25 nM. As a result, PA signals of miR-155 were captured on the second day after tumor inoculation when the solid tumor had not yet formed. Dynamicchanges in miR-155 during tumor growth and chemotherapy were also monitored inreal time to assess the therapeutic effects via PA imaging. By virtue of theseadvantages, the PA nanoprobes may provide a powerful platform for in situdetection of miR-155 and thus real-time monitoring of tumorigenesis and drugresponse in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01537 PMID: 29961324
