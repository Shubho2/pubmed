Participants completed the Sexual ActivityQuestionnaire, questionnaires concerning hormone replacement therapy (HRT),quality of life, care from partner, body image, and comorbidity and providedblood samples. Associations between sexual functioning scores and covariates wereexamined by linear regression. Variables associated with sexual activity wereexamined by logistic regression.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations with sexual pleasure and sexual discomfortscores were expressed by multivariable regression coefficients and associationswith sexual activity were expressed by odds ratios.RESULTS: None of the hormone levels were associated with sexual pleasure incontrast to age (P = .032), current use of systemic HRT (P = .002), and more careform partner (P < .001). Increased free androgen index (P = .016), more care frompartner (P = .017), systemic HRT (P = .002), and no history of cardiovasculardisease (P = .001) were associated with less sexual discomfort. The odds ratio ofbeing sexually active increased with younger age, no breast cancer, betterquality of life, and more care from partner.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that other factors than hormone levels areimportant for sexual functioning, although systemic HRT can have a positiveimpact on sexual functioning in women who have undergone RRSO. Testosteronetherapy could improve women's sexual functioning after RRSO; however, the inverseassociation between free androgen levels and sexual discomfort should beaddressed in future studies.
