China.Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies and the leading cause of cancer‑associated mortality in women worldwide and in China. Everolimus(C53H83NO14) is an efficient anti-cancer drug for breast cancer which targetsmammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The present study investigated theinhibitory effects of everolimus on breast cancer cells and an MCF‑7‑bearingmouse model. The potential mechanism of the everolimus‑mediated decrease ingrowth and aggressiveness of breast cancer cells was reported. Resultsdemonstrated that everolimus significantly inhibited breast cancer cell growth,migration and invasion. It was demonstrated that everolimus induced apoptosisthrough decreasing B cell lymphoma (Bcl)‑2 and Bcl‑w and increasing caspase‑3 andcaspase‑8 expression levels in breast cancer cells. It was observed thateverolimus decreased phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT) andmTOR expression levels in breast cancer cells. Results additionally demonstrated that PI3 K overexpression prevented that everolimus‑mediated inhibition of growthand aggressiveness in MCF‑7 cells. In vivo assays demonstrated that everolimustreatment markedly inhibited tumor growth in the MCF‑7 bearing mouse model.Overall, these data indicate that everolimus inhibits growth and aggressivenessof breast cancer cells through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, suggestingthe PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway may act as a therapeutic target for thetreatment of human cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8769 PMCID: PMC5928673PMID: 29568883
