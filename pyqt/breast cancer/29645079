Ninety-one patientswith breast mass detected by image studies and assigned to conduct diagnosticbiopsy and eventual surgical treatment were studied for demographical, tumourdata and presence of ANA. Serum of positive ANA patients was screened for theextractable nuclear antigen (ENA) profile. As comparison, 91 healthy individuals matched for age and from the same geographical area were included. In this sample72 of 91 (79·1%) had malignant lesions (83% ductal infiltrative carcinoma). ANAwas positive in 44·4% of patients with malignant tumour and in 15·7% of thosewith benign lesions (malignant versus benign with P = 0·03). Controls had ANApositivity in 5·4%, and when compared with tumour samples showed P < 0·0001. The most common immunofluorescence pattern was a fine dense speckled pattern. In the ANA-positive patients with malignant lesions, seven had positivity for ENAprofile (three for anti-RNP and anti-Sm, one for just anti-RNP, two for anti-Roand anti-La e two for just anti-La). It was not possible to associate ANApositivity with tumour histological characteristics or staging or with patient's age. A negative association of ANA with hormonal (oestrogen or oestrogen plusprogesterone) receptor status was found (P = 0·01). In this sample, there was ahigh prevalence of ANA positivity in breast cancer patients with a negativeassociation with the presence of hormonal receptors. More studies are needed tounderstand the real value of this finding.© 2018 British Society for Immunology.DOI: 10.1111/cei.13136 PMCID: PMC6046476 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29645079
