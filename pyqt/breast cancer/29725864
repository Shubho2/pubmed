Of the 464 cases reviewed, anatomicalclassification could be performed in 434 (93.5 %). The largest number of casesshowed single route/single sentinel lymph node (n = 296, 68.2 %), followed bymultiple routes/multiple sentinel lymph nodes (n = 59, 13.6 %), singleroute/multiple sentinel lymph nodes (n = 53, 12.2 %), and multiple routes/single sentinel lymph node (n = 26, 6.0 %). Classification based on the flow directionof lymphatic routes showed that 429 cases (98.8 %) had outward flow on thesuperficial fascia toward axillary lymph nodes, whereas classification based onthe height of sentinel lymph nodes showed that 323 cases (74.4 %) belonged to theupper pectoral group of axillary lymph nodes. There was wide variation in thenumber of lymphatic routes and their branching patterns and in the number,location, and direction of flow of sentinel lymph nodes. It is clinically veryimportant to preoperatively understand the anatomical morphology of lymphaticroutes and sentinel lymph nodes for optimal treatment of breast cancer, andcomputed tomography-lymphography is suitable for this purpose.DOI: 10.1007/s12565-018-0441-2 PMCID: PMC6061239PMID: 29725864
