During this suppression, the main goal is to inhibit the aromatase enzyme that is responsible for the cyclization and structuring of estrogenseither with steroid or non-steroidal-type inhibitors. Non-steroidal derivativesgenerally have a planar aromatic structure attached to the triazole ring systemin their structures, which inhibits hydroxylation reactions during aromatization by coordinating the heme group. Bioisosteric replacement of the triazole ringsystem and development of aromatic/cyclic structures of the side chain canincrease the selectivity for aromatase enzyme inhibition. In this study,pyridine-substituted thiazolylphenol derivatives, which are non-steroidaltriazole bioisosteres, were synthesized using the Hantzsch method, and physicalanalysis and structural determination studies were performed. The IC50 values of the compounds were determined by a fluorescence-based aromatase inhibition assay.Then, their antiproliferative activities on the MCF7 and HEK 293 cell lines were evaluated with the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide(MTT) assay. Furthermore, the crystal structure of human placental aromatase was subjected to a series of docking experiments to identify the possibleinteractions between the most active structure and the active site. Lastly, an insilico technique was performed to analyze and predict the drug-likeness,molecular and ADME properties of the synthesized molecules.© 2018 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft.DOI: 10.1002/ardp.201700272 PMID: 29522642
