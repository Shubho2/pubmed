Electronic address: M.P.Lisanti@salford.ac.uk.Here, we show that a 2:1 mixture of Brutieridin and Melitidin, termed "BMF", has a statin-like properties, which blocks the action of the rate-limiting enzyme formevalonate biosynthesis, namely HMGR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-reductase). Moreover, our results indicate that BMF functionally inhibits several keycharacteristics of CSCs. More specifically, BMF effectively i) reduced ALDHactivity, ii) blocked mammosphere formation and iii) inhibited the activation of CSC-associated signalling pathways (STAT1/3, Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin)targeting Rho-GDI-signalling. In addition, BMF metabolically inhibitedmitochondrial respiration (OXPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Importantly,BMF did not show the same toxic side-effects in normal fibroblasts that wereobserved with statins. Lastly, we show that high expression of the mRNA speciesencoding HMGR is associated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients,providing a potential companion diagnostic for BMF-directed personalized therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
