Epub 2018 Mar 2.The impact of continuous positive airway pressure on radiation dose to heart and lung during left-sided postmastectomy radiotherapy when deep inspiration breathhold technique is not applicable: a case report.Kil WJ(1), Pham T(1), Hossain S(1), Casaigne J(1), Jones K(1)(2), Khalil M(1)(2).Author information: (1)Medicine Service, Radiation Oncology Clinic, Oklahoma City VA Health CareSystem, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.(2)University of Oklahoma Health Science Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.Deep inspiration breathing hold (DIBH) compared to free-breathing (FB) duringradiotherapy (RT) has significantly decreased radiation dose to heart and hasbeen one of the techniques adopted for patients with breast cancer. However,patients who are unable to make suitable deep inspiration breath may not beeligible for DIBH, yet still need to spare the heart and lung during breastcancer RT (left-sided RT in particular). Continuous positive airway pressure(CPAP) is a positive airway pressure ventilator, which keeps the airwayscontinuously open and subsequently inflates the thorax resembling thoracicchanges from DIBH. In this report, authors applied CPAP instead of FB duringleft-sided breast cancer RT including internal mammary node in a patient who was unable to tolerate DIBH, and substantially decreased radiation dose the heart andlung with CPAP compared to FB.DOI: 10.3857/roj.2018.00017 PMCID: PMC5903364PMID: 29506325
