Thetreatment dose of 89 SrCl2 was 2.22 MBq/kg.Results: The efficacy rate of treatment in the lung cancer group was 75.4%,compared to 95.0% in the control group. Approximately 67% of patients with lungcancer and bone metastases and 47% of control patients exhibited mild-to-moderatereductions of leukocyte and platelet counts 4 weeks after 89 SrCl2 treatment.Conclusions: 89 SrCl2 can safely and effectively relieve bone pain caused by bonemetastasis from lung cancer. However, its efficacy was lower in patients withlung cancer with bone metastasis than in those with breast or prostate cancerwith bone metastasis, and its effects on the peripheral hemogram were alsosignificantly stronger in the lung cancer group.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.181172 PMID: 29578147
