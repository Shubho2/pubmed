However, the molecular mechanisms for UPR activation andregulation in cancer cells remain elusive. Here, we show that oncogenic MYCregulates the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)/X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1)branch of the UPR in breast cancer via multiple mechanisms. We found that MYCdirectly controls IRE1 transcription by binding to its promoter and enhancer.Furthermore, MYC forms a transcriptional complex with XBP1, a target of IRE1, andenhances its transcriptional activity. Importantly, we demonstrate that XBP1 is asynthetic lethal partner of MYC. Silencing of XBP1 selectively blocked the growthof MYC-hyperactivated cells. Pharmacological inhibition of IRE1 RNase activitywith small molecule inhibitor 8866 selectively restrained the MYC-overexpressing tumor growth in vivo in a cohort of preclinical patient-derived xenograft models and genetically engineered mouse models. Strikingly, 8866 substantially enhanced the efficacy of docetaxel chemotherapy, resulting in rapid regression ofMYC-overexpressing tumors. Collectively, these data establish the syntheticlethal interaction of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway with MYC hyperactivation and provide a potential therapy for MYC-driven human breast cancers.DOI: 10.1172/JCI95873 PMCID: PMC5873887PMID: 29480818
