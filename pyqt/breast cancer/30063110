ATF6, one of the three major ERstress transducers, has been shown to contribute to chemoresistance by alteringcancer cell survival. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is anoncogene, and its expression has been correlated with the prognosis of cancerpatients. In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between ERstress-related ATF signaling and CIP2A. We found that CIP2A expression waspositively correlated with ATF6 expression by analyzing publicly available RNAsequence data of colorectal cancer patients (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA). Inaddition, we demonstrated that tunicamycin-induced ER stress in vitro upregulatedATF6 and CIP2A. Mechanistically, we found that ATF6 directly bound to the CIP2Apromoter and induced CIP2A gene expression, which contributed to colon cancercell survival. Furthermore, knockdown of CIP2A reduced the viability of cellsunder ER stress. Most importantly, immunohistochemical analysis of a tissuemicroarray from a colon cancer patient cohort showed that higher expressionlevels of ATF6 and CIP2A were associated with a trend toward poor prognosis.Taken together, our results show that ER stress-related ATF6 upregulates CIP2Aand contributes to the prognosis of colon cancer. Targeting CIP2A may disrupt ER stress-mediated colon cancer cell survival and thus improve the prognosis ofcolon cancer patients.This article is protected by copyright.
