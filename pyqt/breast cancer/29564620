Thereference lists given in the identified RCTs were also reviewed to identifypotentially relevant studies.RESULTS: Six RCTs involving 373 patients were included. The change in short- and long-term CRF (SCRF and LCRF, respectively) was calculated as the change in themean score for CRF from baseline to the end of intervention period and to the endof post-intervention follow-up, respectively. Pooled results suggested that TaiChi had a significant positive effect on standard mean difference (i.e., SCRF;SMD = - 0.54; p < 0.0001), but the impact on LCRF remained unclear. Subgroupanalyses of SCRF indicated positive effects of Tai Chi among patients with breast(SMD = - 0.81; p < 0.00001) and lung cancer (SMD = - 0.50; p = 0.002), but notprostate cancer (p = 0.98). Tai Chi also had effects on SCRF that were superiorto physical exercise and psychological support (SMD = - 0.49 and - 0.84,respectively; both p < 0.05). A longer intervention time (8-12 weeks) benefitedSCRF more than a shorter time (SMD = - 1.08 and - 0.36, respectively; bothp < 0.05).CONCLUSION: Tai Chi for more than 8 weeks has short-term ameliorative effects on CRF, especially among patients with breast and lung cancer. Its beneficialeffects are superior to physical exercise and psychological support. It remainsunclear whether there are long-term benefits, and further study is needed.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4136-y PMID: 29564620
