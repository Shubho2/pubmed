In particular, leucine and glutamine havebeen shown to be important for growth and proliferation of some breast cancers,and therefore targeting the primary cell-surface transporters that mediate their uptake, L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) and alanine, serine,cysteine-preferring transporter 2 (ASCT2), is a potential therapeutic strategy.METHODS: The ASCT2 inhibitor, benzylserine (BenSer), is also able to block LAT1activity, thus inhibiting both leucine and glutamine uptake. We therefore aimedto investigate the effects of BenSer in breast cancer cell lines to determinewhether combined LAT1 and ASCT2 inhibition could inhibit cell growth andproliferation.RESULTS: BenSer treatment significantly inhibited both leucine and glutamineuptake in MCF-7, HCC1806 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, causing decreasedcell viability and cell cycle progression. These effects were not primarilyleucine-mediated, as BenSer was more cytostatic than the LAT family inhibitor,BCH. Oocyte uptake assays with ectopically expressed amino acid transportersidentified four additional targets of BenSer, and gas chromatography-massspectrometry (GCMS) analysis of intracellular amino acid concentrations revealed that this BenSer-mediated inhibition of amino acid uptake was sufficient todisrupt multiple pathways of amino acid metabolism, causing reduced lactateproduction and activation of an amino acid response (AAR) through activatingtranscription factor 4 (ATF4).CONCLUSIONS: Together these data showed that BenSer blockade inhibited breastcancer cell growth and viability through disruption of intracellular amino acidhomeostasis and inhibition of downstream metabolic and growth pathways.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4599-8 PMCID: PMC6019833PMID: 29940911
