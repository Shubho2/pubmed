R. China.Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of endogenous RNAs, have emerged as anenigmatic class of genes. However, little is known about their value in theprogression and chemoresistance of cancers. The present study sought to determinethe expression profiles and potential modulatory role of circRNAs on breastcancer cell viability and monastrol resistance. Monastrol-resistant cell lineswere established by exposing breast cancer cells to increasing concentrations of monastrol. A human circRNA microarray was used to search for dysregulatedcircRNAs in monastrol-resistant cells, then circRNA‑MTO1 (hsa‑circRNA-007874) wasvalidated as a circRNA that exhibited elevated expression levels inmonastrol-resistant cells. Mechanistic investigations suggested that upregulationof circRNA‑MTO1 suppressed cell viability, promoted monastrol-induced cellcytotoxicity and reversed monastrol resistance. Subsequently, Eg5 was identified as the functional target of circRNA‑MTO1, and MTO1 inhibited Eg5 protein levelbut not mRNA level. By treating with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide(CHX), it was revealed that MTO1 did not affect the protein stability of Eg5.RNA-pull down experiments followed by mass spectrometry revealed that MTO1interacted with tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 4 (TRAF4), andsequester TRAF4 from activating Eg5 translation, thereby inhibiting the Eg5protein level. Taken together, the data reveal a regulatory mechanism bycircRNA‑MTO1 to control cell viability and monastrol resistance in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4485 PMID: 30015883
