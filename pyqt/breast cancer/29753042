Electronic address: aalizadeh@sina.tums.ac.ir.The E75 peptide vaccine, derived from tumor-associated antigen HER2, is the most frequently studied anti-HER2 vaccination strategy for the treatment of breastcancer patients. It has been investigated in the several phases Ι/Π of theclinical trials and is currently being evaluated in a randomized multicenterphase III clinical trial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis toclarify the outcomes of the E75 peptide vaccine including the therapeuticefficacy, the disease recurrence, the survival rate, and the side effects. Three peer-reviewed literature databases including the PubMed, Web of Science, andScopus were sought. Of 29 trials assessed for eligibility, 16 were consideredbased on our inclusion criteria. Statistical analyses were performed by The Exceland STATA v.11.0. Meta-analysis of delayed-type hypersensitivity)DTH( reactionsand CD8+-T cell levels, as immune responses, displayed the significantdifferences in the vaccinated groups compared to their non-vaccinatedcounterparts. In addition, the recurrence, and the overall and the disease-freesurvival were significantly different in the vaccinated subjects versus thecontrol. Evaluation of the local and systemic toxicity of the E75 peptide vaccinedemonstrated the minimal side effects. It seems that the E75 peptide vaccine issafe and effective, and can be used for further randomized clinical trials.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
