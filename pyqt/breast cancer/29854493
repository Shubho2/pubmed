We presentan extremely rare case of a 68-year-old woman with advanced ascending colonadenocarcinoma that presented with multiple rapidly progressing painlesscutaneous metastatic lesions with no other distant metastases. Of all the tumors,breast cancer most commonly spreads as cutaneous metastasis is followed by lung, colorectal, renal, ovarian, and bladder cancers. Cutaneous metastases can presentin a variety of clinical manifestations, such as a rapidly growing painlessdermal or subcutaneous nodule with intact overlying epidermis or as ulcers. Incases where the cutaneous deposit is isolated, as in visceral metastasis, thereis a role for radical management such as wide local excision and reconstruction. In our patient, since she had multiple cutaneous metastases she began treatmentwith palliative systemic combination chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1155/2018/8032905 PMCID: PMC5952443PMID: 29854493
