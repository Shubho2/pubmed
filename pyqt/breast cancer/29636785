This study focused on the intestinal absorption of rhein in disassembly ofthe TWCQT extracts through the Caco-2 cell monolayer model to explicate thepossible detoxification mechanism of herb-herb compatibility in TWCQT. Theresults showed that the intestinal absorption of rhein occurred through activediffusion, and rhein might be composed of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)substrates. The extract of processed liquorice increased the exclusion rate andreduced intracellular uptake of rhein. The consistent results observed in TWCQTfurther implied that processed liquorice in TWCQT could suppress the absorptionof rhein across the Caco-2 cell monolayer. It has therefore been concluded thatthe active ingredients of processed liquorice may play a critical role inreducing the intestinal absorption of rhein to alleviate the toxicity of rhubarb in TWCQT. Because of BCRP's involvement in rhein transport, we conjectured thatsome components in processed liquorice could inhibit the transport of rhein,possibly by mediating BCRP. These results would provide new insight into thisancient drug combination in toxicity reduction and clinical use.DOI: 10.1155/2018/7835128 PMCID: PMC5831597PMID: 29636785
