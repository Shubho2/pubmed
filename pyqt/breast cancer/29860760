Methods: Clinicaldata of 618 patients with breast-conserving therapy in Tianjin Medical UniversityCancer Institute and Hospital from August 2005 to August 2010 were analyzedretrospectively. According to the molecular classification when breast cancer wasdiagnosed, patients were subdivided into five groups, including Luminal A,Luminal B1, Luminal B2, HER-2-positive and Triple-negative. Clinicopathologicalcharacteristics and prognosis were compared among five groups and the influencingfactors of local recurrence, distant metastasis and overall survival wereanalyzed. Results: Among 618 patients, there were 148 cases Luminal A, 231 cases Luminal B1, 63 cases Luminal B2, 40 cases HER-2-positive and 136 casesTriple-negative. The age, family history, TNM stage, calcification, histological grade, pathological type and response to endocrine therapy of these 5 moleculartypes of breast cancer patients were significantly different (all P<0.05). The5-year local regional recurrence-free survival rates of Luminal A, Luminal B1,Luminal B2, HER-2-positive and Triple-negative were 99.3%, 98.7%, 98.4%, 94.9%and 95.9%, respectively, without significant differences (P=0.104). The 5-yeardistant metastasis-free survival rates of these 5 types were 97.3%, 95.7%, 93.7%,87.5% and 91.4%, respectively, with significant differences (P=0.013). Moreover, the 5-year overall survival rates of these 5 types were 98.6%, 97.8%, 98.4%,92.5% and 95.6%, respectively, without significant differences (P=0.153).Multifactor analysis showed that radiotherapy (HR=0.036, P=0.049) and the number of lymph node metastases (HR=10.72, P=0.004) were independent factors of localrecurrence of breast cancer patients underwent breast-conserving therapy. The age(HR=0.369, P=0.046), status of surgical margin (HR=5.486, P=0.007), number oflymph node metastases (HR=2.882, P=0.023) and molecular typing (HR=5.191,P=0.008) were independent factors of distant metastasis of above breast cancerpatients. None of the factors were found to be independent factors of the overallsurvival of these breast cancer patients. Conclusions: Breast conserving therapy does not increase the risks of local recurrence and death of HER-2-positive andTriple-negative breast cancer patients. Therefore, breast conserving therapy can be accepted by patients with HER-2-positive and Triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher: 目的：分析乳腺癌分子分型与保乳治疗乳腺癌患者预后的关系，从分子分型角度探讨保乳手术的安全性问题。方法：回顾性分析2005年8月至2010年8月天津医科大学肿瘤医院618例行保乳手术的乳腺癌患者，根据分子分型不同分为Luminal A型、LuminalB1型、Luminal B2型、人表皮生长因子受体2(human epidermal growth factor receptor-2,HER-2)过表达型、三阴性型，比较5型患者的临床病理特征及预后，分析局部复发、远处转移和总生存的影响因素。 结果： Luminal A型148例，LuminalB1型231例，LuminalB2型63例，HER-2过表达型40例，三阴性型136例。5种分子分型乳腺癌患者的年龄、肿瘤家族史、TNM分期、钙化、组织学分级、病理类型、内分泌治疗差异有统计学意义(均P<0.05)。Luminal A型、Luminal B1型、LuminalB2型、HER-2过表达型和三阴性型患者的5年无复发生存率分别为99.3%、98.7%、98.4%、94.9%和95.6%，差异无统计学意义(P＝0.104)；5年无转移生存率分别为97.3%、95.7%、93.7%、87.5%和91.4%，差异有统计学意义(P＝0.013)；5年总生存率分别为98.6%、97.8%、98.4%、92.5%和95.6%，差异无统计学意义(P＝0.153)。多因素分析显示，放疗(HR＝0.036，P＝0.049)、淋巴结转移数目(HR＝10.72，P＝0.004)是保乳治疗乳腺癌患者局部复发的独立影响因素，年龄(HR＝0.369，P＝0.046)、切缘状态(HR＝5.486，P＝0.007)、淋巴结转移数目(HR＝2.882，P＝0.023)、分子分型(HR＝5.191，P＝0.008)是保乳治疗乳腺癌患者远处转移的独立影响因素，未显示任何因素为保乳治疗乳腺癌患者总生存的独立影响因素。 结论： HER-2过表达型和三阴性型乳腺癌不会增加保乳患者的局部复发和死亡风险，故HER-2过表达型和三阴性型乳腺癌患者可接受保乳治疗。.PMID: 29860760  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
