Adult women undergoing mastectomy for stage 1, 2, or 3 invasiveductal or lobular breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or prophylaxis wereinvited to participate. Data analysis was conducted from September 2015 toOctober 2017.Exposures: Mastectomy only or mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.Main Outcomes and Measures: Preoperative measures predicted were 12-monthhappiness (Cantril Ladder) and quality of life, predicted satisfaction withbreasts, sexual attractiveness, breast numbness, and pain (measured with BreastQ single items). Measures at 12 months postoperative added the Decision RegretScale and Satisfaction With Decisions Scale.Results: Of 214 eligible patients, 182 consecutive patients were approached, and 145 enrolled (80%). Of these 145 patients, 131 returned surveys (72%) and 111 of these remained at 12 months (88%). Fifteen who had delayed reconstruction wereexcluded from analysis, leaving a final cohort of 96 women; 54 had not hadreconstruction and 42 had had reconstruction. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was53.9 (12.1) years; 73 (76%) were white; 50 (52%) were college graduates; 54 (56%)were privately insured; 69 (72%) had disease at stages 0, 1, or 2; and 31 (32%)received adjuvant radiation. Patients having mastectomy without reconstructionunderestimated future well-being in all domains. Differences were significant forquality of life scores (mean predicted, 68 vs mean actual, 74; t50, -2.47;P = .02) and satisfaction with breasts-clothed (mean predicted, 2.4 vs meanactual, 2.8; t49, -2.11; P = .04). Patients undergoing mastectomy withreconstruction overestimated future well-being in all but 1 domain. Differenceswere significant for satisfaction with breasts-unclothed (mean predicted, 3.1 vs mean actual, 2.6; t41, 2.70; P = .01); sexual attractiveness-clothed (meanpredicted, 3.7 vs mean actual, 3.3; t39, 2.29; P = .03); sexualattractiveness-unclothed (mean predicted, 3.3 vs mean actual, 2.3; t40, 5.57;P < .001). Both groups experienced more numbness than predicted (mean predicted, 2.79 and 2.72 for mastectomy only and mastectomy with reconstruction groups,respectively; mean actual, 3.52 and 3.56, respectively; t47, -3.4 and t38, -2.9, respectively; P < .01). Patients who were less happy (β = 6.3; P = .02) or hadgreater pain (β = 8.7; P < .001) than predicted had greater regret.Conclusions and Relevance: Patients underestimated future well-being aftermastectomy and overestimated well-being after reconstruction. Misprediction wasassociated with regret. Decision support for breast reconstruction should addressexpectations about well-being.DOI: 10.1001/jamasurg.2017.6112 PMCID: PMC5875341PMID: 29417143
