An isoform protein of DLX4called BP1 is expressed in 80% of invasive ductal breast carcinomas. BP1overexpression is implicated in an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. BP1upregulation is associated with estrogen receptor negativity so those tumors donot respond to antiestrogens. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women. BP1 could serve as both a novel prognostic biomarker for breast cancer and a therapeutic target. In this review, we address the role of BP1 protein intumorigenesis of breast cancer and four other malignancies. A number of functionsof BP1 in cancer are also discussed.DOI: 10.2217/bmm-2017-0212 PMID: 29575937
