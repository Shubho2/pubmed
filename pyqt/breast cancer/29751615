The high conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK, Maxi-K channels)play an important role in the survival of some BC phenotypes, via membranehyperpolarization and regulation of cell cycle. BK channels have been implicated in BC cell proliferation and invasion. Penitrems are indole diterpene alkaloidsproduced by various terrestrial and marine Penicillium species. Penitrem A (1) isa selective BK channel antagonist with reported antiproliferative andanti-invasive activities against multiple malignancies, including BC. This study reports the high expression of BK channel in different BC subtypes. In silico BK channel binding affinity correlates with the antiproliferative activities ofselected penitrem analogs. 1 showed the best binding fitting at multiple BKchannel crystal structures, targeting the calcium-sensing aspartic acid moieties at the calcium bowel and calcium binding sites. Further, 1 reduced the levels of BK channel expression and increased expression of TNF-&alpha; in different BCcell types. Penitrem A (1) induced G1 cell cycle arrest of BC cells, and induced upregulation of the arrest protein p27. Combination treatment of 1 with targeted anti-HER drugs resulted in synergistic antiproliferative activity, which wasassociated with reduced EGFR and HER2 receptor activation, as well as reducedactive forms of AKT and STAT3. Collectively, the BK channel antagonistsrepresented by penitrem A can be novel sensitizing, chemotherapeuticssynergizing, and therapeutic agents for targeted BC therapy.DOI: 10.3390/md16050157 PMCID: PMC5983288PMID: 29751615
