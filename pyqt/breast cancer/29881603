Epub 2018 Jan 8.Results of surveillance in individuals at high-risk of pancreatic cancer: Asystematic review and meta-analysis.Signoretti M(1), Bruno MJ(2), Zerboni G(1), Poley JW(2), Delle Fave G(1), CapursoG(1).Author information: (1)Digestive and Liver Disease Unit, S. Andrea Hospital, Rome, Italy.(2)Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus Medical Center,University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.Background: Data on surveillance for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) inhigh-risk individuals (HRIs) with "familial pancreatic cancer" (FPC) and specificsyndromes are limited and heterogeneous.Objective: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of PDACsurveillance studies in HRIs.Methods: Prevalence of solid/cystic pancreatic lesions and of lesions considered a successful target of surveillance (proven resectable PDAC and high-gradeprecursors) was pooled across studies. The rate of lesions diagnosed byendoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and acrossdifferent HRI groups was calculated.Results: Sixteen studies incorporating 1588 HRIs were included. The pooledprevalence of pancreatic solid and cystic lesions was 5.8% and 20.2%,respectively. The pooled prevalence of patients with lesions considered asuccessful target of surveillance was 3.3%, being similar to EUS or MRI andvarying across subgroups, being 3% in FPC, 4% in hereditary pancreatitis, 5% infamilial melanoma, 6.3% in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, and 12.2% inPeutz-Jeghers syndrome. The pooled estimated rate of lesions considered asuccessful target of surveillance during follow-up was 5/1000 person-years.Conclusion: Surveillance programs identify successful target lesions in 3.3% ofHRIs with a similar yield of EUS and MRI and an annual risk of 0.5%. A higherrate of target lesions was reported in HRIs with specific DNA mutations.DOI: 10.1177/2050640617752182 PMCID: PMC5987280PMID: 29881603
