TheHDRA utilizes 3-dimensional culture of human tumors on Gelfoam®. The evaluationrate was 98.8%. The HDRA mean inhibition rate of primary tumors vs. recurrenttumors was, respectively, 57.9% and 38.6% for doxorubicin (DOX); 59.9% and 42.8% for mitomycin C (MMC); 49.0% and 33.4% for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); and 34.5% and16.0% for cisplatinum (CDDP). The recurrent cases were pretreated clinically withCAF (cyclophosphamide [CTX], DOX, and 5-FU), CEF (CTX, epirubicin [EPN], and5-FU), or CMF (CTX, methotrexate [MTX], and 5-FU). 64.7% of the recurrent caseswere resistant to all four agents tested compared to 27% of the primary cases.Only 5.9% of the recurrent cases were sensitive to three or more agents asopposed to 18% of the primary cases. The correlation of the HDRA results toclinical outcome in another breast-cancer study was 80.0% with 15 cases evaluatedconsisting of five true positives, three false positives, seven true negatives,and no false negatives. HDRA was also performed on surgical specimens of primary tumor and axillary lymph node metastasis from each of 30 breast cancer patients. The lymph-node metastases were more resistant than the primary tumor for DOX,5-FU, and MMC, but not for CDDP. The data suggest that both primary tumor andmetastases from individual patients should be tested in the HDRA to enhanceclinical efficacy of chemotherapy. There also was a lack of correlation withbreast cancer subtype and drug response in the HDRA, further suggesting theimportance of individualized treatment for breast cancer patients afforded by theHDRA.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7745-1_10 PMID: 29572797
