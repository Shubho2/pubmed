Approximately, 50% of patients with metastatic cancer will develop resistance to Tamoxifen. In this research, Tamoxifen was combined with the anti-cancer compoundCurcumin. Diblocknanopolymer was used to package the new formulation of Curcumin and Tamoxifen. Anti-cancer efficacy of the obtained compound was evaluated inTamoxifen-sensitive (TS). MCF-7, Tamoxifen-resistant (TR) MCF-7 cancer cells and Fibroblast cells. MTT assay was used to evaluate anti-proliferation and toxicity.Flow cytometry and Annexin-V-FLUOS were used to assay anti-proliferation andinduction of apoptosis respectively. Our results indicate that the obtainednano-compound is less toxic to normal cells compared to Tamoxifen alone, and has higher anti-proliferation and pro-apoptotic activity on TS-MCF-7 and TR-MCF-7.The nanopolymer reduces the Tamoxifen toxicity in normal cells and counters thedeveloped resistance to the drug in cancer cells.PMCID: PMC5937073PMID: 29755534
