Patients received the same dose of eribulin as that used inthe EMBRACE trial: 1.4 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 21 days.RESULTS: In a total of 53 patients, 32% obtained a partial response, 11% a stabledisease, and 43% a clinical benefit (CB). After a median follow-up of 36 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.7 months and median overall survival(OS) 13.53 months. Median PFS was significantly longer in patients who reported aCB compared to those with no CB, while survival outcomes (PFS and OS) were betterin patients who received > 6 cycles of eribulin. Eribulin showed a goodtolerability profile with acceptable toxicities, similar to those reported inEMBRACE.CONCLUSIONS: Our experience in a real-world setting confirms the activity,efficacy, and good tolerability profile of eribulin in heavily pretreated BCpatients.Â© 2018 S.
