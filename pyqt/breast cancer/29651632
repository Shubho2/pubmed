Metastasisinvolves the reorganization of cytoskeleton and cell shape for the swift movementof the cells through extracellular matrix. Previously, we have described theinvasive and metastatic role played by one of the members (Toca-1) of CIP4subfamily of F-BAR proteins. In the present study, we address the role of anothermember (FBP17) of same family in the invasion breast cancer cells. Here, wereport that the formin-binding protein 17 (FBP17) is highly expressed at bothmRNA and protein levels in breast cancer cells. The study showed the association of FBP17 with cytoskeletal actin regulatory proteins like dynamin and cortactin. To determine its role in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, we achievedstable knockdown of FBP17 in MDA-MB-231 cells. FBP17 knockdown cells showed adefect and were found to be compromised in the degradation of ECM indicating the role of FBP17 in the invasion of breast cancer cells. Our results suggest thatFBP17 is highly expressed in breast cancer cells and facilitates the invasion of breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1007/s12032-018-1132-5 PMID: 29651632
