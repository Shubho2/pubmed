We aimed to validate the association of tumor AGR2 mRNAexpression with disease-specific survival (DSS) and identify differentiallyexpressed signaling pathways between high and low AGR2 expression tumor groups.Methods: Primary tumor mRNA expression data from the METABRIC study was used toevaluate AGR2 expression as a prognostic factor for DSS while adjusting forsurvival-determining confounders using Cox proportional-hazards regression.Differentially expressed genes and signaling pathway differences between high andlow AGR2 groups were determined by modular enrichment analyses using DAVID andIngenuity Pathway Analysis.Results: Increased tumor AGR2 mRNA expression was associated with decreased DSSamong 1,341 women (per each standard deviation increase of AGR2 expression: HR1.14, 95% CI: 1.01-1.29, P = 0.03). Pathway analyses supported prior experimentalstudies showing that estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) regulated AGR2 expression.Canonical signaling pathways significantly differentially represented betweenhigh and low AGR2 groups included those involved in inflammation and immunity.Conclusion: Increased primary tumor AGR2 expression was associated with decreasedDSS. Pathway analyses suggested that increased AGR2 was associated withendoplasmic reticular homeostasis, possibly allowing tumor cells to overcomehypoxic stress and meet the increased protein demand of tumorigenesis, therebypreventing unfolded protein response-mediated apoptosis.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25225 PMCID: PMC5955412PMID: 29796176
