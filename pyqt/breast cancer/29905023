[Epub ahead of print]Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with exemestane followed by response-guidedcombination therapy with low-dose cyclophosphamide in postmenopausal patientswith estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer: A multicenter, open-label, phaseII study.Sato N(1), Masuda N(2), Morimoto T(3), Ueno T(4), Kanbayashi C(1), Kaneko K(1),Yasojima H(2), Saji S(5), Sasano H(6), Morita S(7), Ohno S(8), Toi M(9).Author information: (1)Department of Breast Oncology, Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Niigata, Japan.(2)Department of Surgery, Breast Oncology, National Hospital Organization OsakaNational Hospital, Osaka, Japan.(3)Department of Breast Surgery, Yao Municipal Hospital, Osaka, Japan.(4)Breast Surgical Oncology, Breast Oncology Center, Cancer Institute Hospital,Tokyo, Japan.(5)Department of Medical Oncology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima,Japan.(6)Department of Pathology, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Japan.(7)Department of Biomedical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Kyoto UniversityGraduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.(8)Breast Oncology Center, Cancer Institute Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.(9)Department of Surgery (Breast Surgery), Graduate School of Medicine, KyotoUniversity, Kyoto, Japan.Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer are less likely toachieve a pathological complete response (pCR) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy may be more appropriate than neoadjuvantchemotherapy in these hormone-sensitive patients. Most patients with ER-positive breast cancer are postmenopausal, and therefore, generally older and less able totolerate chemotherapy. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety oftailored neoadjuvant endocrine and chemoendocrine therapy for postmenopausalbreast cancer patients. Untreated patients with primary invasive ER-positive,HER2-negative, stage I-IIIA breast cancer, and Ki67 index ≤30% were enrolled.Patients received exemestane 25 mg/d for 12 weeks. Based on clinical response andchange in Ki67 index, assessed at 8-12 weeks, patients with complete response(CR), partial response (PR) with Ki67 index ≤5% after treatment, or stabledisease (SD) with Ki67 index ≤5% before and after treatment were defined asresponders. For the subsequent 24 weeks, responders continued exemestanemonotherapy (group A), and nonresponders received exemestane 25 mg/d pluscyclophosphamide 50 mg/d (group B). The primary endpoint was clinical response atweeks 24 and 36. A total of 59 patients (median age, 69 years) started initialexemestane monotherapy. After exclusion of three patients who discontinued duringthis period, 56 remained enrolled to receive subsequent treatment. Clinicalresponse rates (CR and PR) and 95% CI at weeks 24 and 36 were 85% (12/14;57.2%-98.2%) and 71% (10/14; 41.9%-91.6%), respectively, in group A; and 54%(23/42; 38.7%-70.2%) and 71% (30/42; 55.4%-84.3%), respectively, in group B. Atweek 36, no significant difference was found in median Ki67 index between thegroups (3.5% and 4.0%). There were no treatment-related deaths. We found thatclinical response comparable to that of responders was achieved in nonresponders after addition of cyclophosphamide to the initial endocrine therapy.© 2018 The Authors.
