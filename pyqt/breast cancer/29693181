China.Breast carcinoma is one of the most common types of malignant neoplasms, and isassociated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Altered gene expression iscritical in the development of breast cancer. To identify the importantdifferentially expressed genes and microRNAs in breast carcinoma, mRNA (GSE26910,GSE42568, and GSE89116) and microRNA (GSE35412) microarray datasets weredownloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentiallyexpressed microRNA expression data were extracted with GEO2R online software. TheDAVID online database was used to perform a function and pathway enrichmentanalysis of the key identified differentially expressed genes. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING online database, andvisualized in Cytoscape software. The effect of the expression level of the keyidentified genes on overall survival (OS) time was analyzed by using theKaplan-Meier Plotter online database. Furthermore, the online miRNA databasesTargetScan, microT-CDS, and TarBase were used to identify the target genes of thedifferentially expressed miRNAs. A total of 254 differentially expressed geneswere identified, which were enriched in cell adhesion, polysaccharide binding,extracellular region part and ECM-receptor interactions. The PPI networkcontained 250 nodes and 375Â edges. Five differentially expressed genes were foundto be significantly negatively correlated with the differentially expressedmiRNAs, which were potentially also target genes for miRNAs. Four of the fivegenes, including AKAP12, SOPB, TCF7L2, COL12A1 and TXNIP were downregulated, and were associated with the OS of patients with breast carcinoma. In addition, atotal of 130 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. In conclusion,these results constitute a novel model for miRNA-mRNA differential expressionpatterns, and further studies may provide potential targets for diagnosing andunderstanding the mechanisms of breast carcinoma.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6393 PMID: 29693181
