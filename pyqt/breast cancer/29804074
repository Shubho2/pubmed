Metastatic spread tothe colon and rectum in breast cancer is rare. This report describes a case of a 69-year-old woman with metastatic ductal breast cancer to the rectosigmoid,presenting as an incidental finding on screening colonoscopy. The breastcarcinoma was first diagnosed 2 years prior. Colonic biopsies from colonoscopyconfirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with a breast primary. Ultimately her clinical condition worsened as she developed malignant ascites, a small bowelobstruction, and new bone metastases, and the patient succumbed to her illness.Cases of metastatic breast cancer to the gastrointestinal tract havepredominantly been lobular breast carcinoma. Increased awareness of colonicmetastasis may lead to more accurate diagnosis and earlier systemic treatment.Â© BMJ Publishing Group Ltd (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article)2018.
