Here, we identified whole-genome doubling(WGD) in the tumors of nearly 30% of 9,692 prospectively sequenced advancedcancer patients. WGD varied by tumor lineage and molecular subtype, and aroseearly in carcinogenesis after an antecedent transforming driver mutation. Whileassociated with TP53 mutations, 46% of all WGD arose in TP53-wild-type tumors andin such cases was associated with an E2F-mediated G1 arrest defect, althoughneither aberration was obligate in WGD tumors. The variability of WGD acrosscancer types can be explained in part by cancer cell proliferation rates. WGDpredicted for increased morbidity across cancer types, including KRAS-mutantcolorectal cancers and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers, independentlyof established clinical prognostic factors. We conclude that WGD is highly commonin cancer and is a macro-evolutionary event associated with poor prognosis acrosscancer types.DOI: 10.1038/s41588-018-0165-1 PMCID: PMC6072608 [Available on 2019-01-16]PMID: 30013179
