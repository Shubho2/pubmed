In the present study, we investigated the effects of 15d-PGJ2 on the activity of PTEN, the inhibitor ofthe phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt axis, in human breast cancer (MCF-7)cells. Since the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety in the cyclopentenone ring of15d-PGJ2 is electrophilic, we hypothesized that 15d-PGJ2-induced Aktphosphorylation might result from the covalent modification and subsequentinactivation of PTEN that has several critical cysteine residues. When treated toMCF-7 cells, 15d-PGJ2 bound to PTEN, and this was abolished in the presence ofthe thiol-reducing agent dithiothreitol. A mass spectrometric analysis by usingrecombinant and endogenous PTEN protein revealed that the cysteine 136 residue(Cys136) of PTEN is covalently modified upon treatment with 15d-PGJ2. Notably,the ability of 15d-PGJ2 to covalently bind to PTEN as well as to induce Aktphosphorylation was abolished in the cells expressing a mutant form of PTEN inwhich Cys136 was replaced by serine (C136S-PTEN). The present study demonstrates for the first time that electrophilic 15d-PGJ2 directly binds to cysteine 136 of PTEN and provides new insight into PTEN loss in cancer progression associatedwith chronic inflammation. These observations suggest that 15d-PGJ2 can undergonucleophilic addition to PTEN, presumably at Cys136, thereby inactivating thistumor suppressor protein with concomitant Akt activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
