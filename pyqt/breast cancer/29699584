We report here the mechanism of the AR in regulating the behavior of MABC.METHODS: The MABC cell line, MDA-MB-453, and the nonMABC cell line, MCF7, wereused in this study. The effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and heat shockprotein 27 (HSP27) on cell proliferation was quantified using the cell counterkit-8 (CCK8) and clonogenic assays in vitro and by a xenograft tumor model invivo. The expression of the AR and HSP27 was analyzed using western blot, qPCR,and immunofluorescence assays. Complexes of the AR and HSP27 were detected byco-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP).RESULTS: In MDA-MB-453 cells, DHT promoted cell proliferation and stimulated ARand HSP27 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, whereas, it inhibited MCF7 cell growth, and only the AR translocated into the nucleus. HSP27 knock-downdecreased the proliferative ability of MDA-MB-453 cells, which could be rescuedby DHT, while HSP27 and DHT had synergistic effects on MCF7 cells. HSP27phosphorylation was a prerequisite for AR translocation into the nucleus,especially phosphorylation on serine 82. In addition, DHT stimulated thetumorigenic and metastatic capacities of MDA-MB-453 cells, while HSP27 knock-downdecreased the rate of tumor formation and induced apoptosis in cells.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that HSP27 assists the AR in regulating themalignant behavior of MABC, and these findings might be helpful in the treatment of MABC.DOI: 10.1186/s13046-018-0762-y PMCID: PMC5921986PMID: 29699584
