A systematic search was conducted in PubMed,Spring, Wanfang, and CNKI databases from 1923 to December 2016. Based on fixedeffect model or randomized effects model, standardized mean difference (SMD) withits 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated in accordance withheterogeneity analysis. Cochran Q and I tests were used to measure heterogeneity.Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the strength of the meta-analysis.In total, 8 studies were enrolled in the meta-analysis. Tumor size of breastcancer was obviously decreased when evaluated by CEUS (SMD, 0.96; 95% CI,0.76-1.15) after NAC. After aggregating the data by the fixed effect model, theCEUS time-intensity curve showed a great reduction in the area under the curve ofpatients receiving NAC (SMD, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.08-0.69). Based on CEUS, tumor size and area under the CEUS time-intensity curve were both reduced. We suggest thatthe CEUS is a promising tool for evaluating the response of breast cancer afterNAC.DOI: 10.1097/RUQ.0000000000000333 PMID: 29420367
