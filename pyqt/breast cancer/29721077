Whether the non-coding genome isaltered concordantly with the coding genome and the mechanism by which the cellcycle directly controls the non-coding genome is poorly understood. Methods:Herein, the miRNA signature maintained by endogenous cyclin D1 in human breastcancer cells was defined. In order to determine the clinical significance of the cyclin D1-mediated miRNA signature, we defined a miRNA expression superset from459 breast cancer samples. We compared the coding and non-coding genome of breastcancer subtypes. Results: Hierarchical clustering of human breast cancers definedfour distinct miRNA clusters (G1-G4) associated with distinguishable relapse-freesurvival by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The cyclin D1-regulated miRNA signatureincluded several oncomirs, was conserved in multiple breast cancer cell lines,was associated with the G2 tumor miRNA cluster, ERα+ status, better outcome andactivation of the Wnt pathway. The coding and non-coding genome were discordantwithin breast cancer subtypes. Seed elements for cyclin D1-regulated miRNA wereidentified in 63 genes of the Wnt signaling pathway including DKK. Cyclin D1restrained DKK1 via the 3'UTR. In vivo studies using inducible transgenicsconfirmed cyclin D1 induces Wnt-dependent gene expression. Conclusion: Thenon-coding genome defines breast cancer subtypes that are discordant with theircoding genome subtype suggesting distinct evolutionary drivers within the tumors.Cyclin D1 orchestrates expression of a miRNA signature that induces Wnt/β-cateninsignaling, therefore cyclin D1 serves both upstream and downstream ofWnt/β-catenin signaling.DOI: 10.7150/thno.23877 PMCID: PMC5928887PMID: 29721077
