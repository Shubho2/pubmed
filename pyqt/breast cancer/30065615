In meta-analysis, Allelic and GG vs. CC geneticcomparison model were found to be associated with breast cancer risk. Moreover,recessive comparison model indicated a protective correlation with breast cancer occurrence.Conclusion: The findings of our case-control study and meta-analysis suggest asignificant association between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and an increased riskof breast cancer in Indian population.DOI: 10.2174/1389202919666171205104137 PMCID: PMC6030857 [Available on 2019-02-01]PMID: 30065615
