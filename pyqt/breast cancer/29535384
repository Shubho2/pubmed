Here, we describe anintegrative genomic and RNAi-based approach that identifies and validates geneaddictions in TNBCs. CNAs and gene expression alterations are integrated andgenes scored for pre-specified target features revealing 130 candidate genes. We test functional dependence on each of these genes using RNAi in breast cancer andnon-malignant cells, validating malignant cell selective dependence upon 37 of130 genes. Further analysis reveals a cluster of 13 TNBC addiction genesfrequently co-upregulated that includes genes regulating cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage response, and malignant cell selective mitotic genes. We validate the mechanism of addiction to a potential drug target: the mitotic kinesin familymember C1 (KIFC1/HSET), essential for successful bipolar division ofcentrosome-amplified malignant cells and develop a potential selection biomarker to identify patients with tumors exhibiting centrosome amplification.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03283-z PMCID: PMC5849766PMID: 29535384  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
