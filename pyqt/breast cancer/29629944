[Epub ahead of print]Human Endometriosis Tissue Microarray Reveals Site-specific Expression ofEstrogen Receptors, Progesterone Receptor, and Ki67.Colón-Caraballo M(1), García M(2), Mendoza A(3)(4), Flores I(1)(5).Author information: (1)Departments of Basic Sciences, Microbiology Division.(2)Hato Rey Pathology Inc., San Juan, PR.(3)Pathology Division.(4)Southern Pathology Inc., Ponce.(5)Ob-Gyn, Ponce Health Sciences University.Most available therapies for endometriosis are hormone-based and generallybroadly used without taking into consideration the ovarian hormone receptorexpression status. This contrasts strikingly with the standard of care for other hormone-based conditions such as breast cancer. We therefore aimed tocharacterize the expression of ovarian steroid hormone receptors for estrogenalpha (ESR1), estrogen beta (ESR2), and progesterone (PGR) in different types of endometriotic lesions and eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis andcontrols using a tissue microarray (TMA). Nuclear expression levels of thereceptors were analyzed by tissue (ie, ectopic vs. eutopic endometrium) and cell type (ie, glands vs. stroma). Ovarian lesions showed the lowest expression ofESR1 and PGR, and the highest expression of ESR2, whereas the fallopian tubelesions showed high expression of the 3 receptors. Differences among endometriaincluded lower expression of ESR1 and higher expression of ESR2 in stroma ofproliferative endometrium from patients versus patients, and a trend towards lossof PGR nuclear positivity in proliferative endometrium from patients. The largestESR2:ESR1 ratios were observed in ovarian lesions and secretory endometrium. The highest proportion of samples with >10% Ki67 positive nuclei was in glands offallopian tube (54%) and extrapelvic lesions (75%); 60% of glands of secretoryendometrium from patients had >10% Ki67 positivity compared with only 15% incontrols. Our results provide a better understanding of endometriosisheterogeneity by revealing lesion type-specific differences and case-by-casevariability in the expression of ovarian hormone receptors. This knowledge could potentially predict individual responses to hormone therapies, and set the basis for the application of personalized medicine approaches for women withendometriosis.DOI: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000663 PMID: 29629944
