Electronicaddress: cuihe_dorctor@163.com.Centromere protein I (CENPI),an important member of centromere protein family,has been suggest to serve as a oncogene in breast cancer, but the clinicalsignificance and biological function of CENPI in colorectal cancer (CRC) is stillunclear. In our results, we found CENPI was overexpressed in CRC tissues andcells, and associated with clinical stage, tumor depth, lymph node metastasis,distant metastasis and differentiation in CRC patients. However, there was nosignificant association between CENPI protein expression and overall survivaltime in colon cancer patients and rectal cancer patients through analyzing TCGAsurvival data. Moreover, CENPI mRNA and protein were increased in metastaticlymph nodes compared with primary CRC tissues. Down-regulation of CENPIexpression suppresses CRC cell migration, invasion and epithelial mesenchymaltransition process. In conclusion, CENPI is overexpressed in CRC and functions asoncogene in modulating CRC cell migration, invasion and EMT process.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
