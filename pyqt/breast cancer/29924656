The present study was designed to test whether levels of circulating autoantibodies to survivinprotein-derived antigens is altered in liver, esophageal, breast, and lungcancers.METHODS: Patients with liver (144), esophageal (159), breast (124), and lungcancers (267), and healthy volunteers (362) were recruited for the study, andserum samples were collected for ELISA autoantibody analysis.RESULTS: Compared with the control group, survivin autoantibody levels weresignificantly higher in serum from patients with breast cancer and lung cancer,but were significantly lower in serum from patients with liver cancer (p < 0.05).In stage I and II lung cancer, the best-fit areas under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve was 0.731 (standard error [SE] = 0.023; 95% confidenceinterval [CI] 0.687-0.776) and the sensitivity, with 90% specificity, was 23.7%.CONCLUSION: Analysis across four types of malignancies revealed that the survivinautoantibody had good specificity and sensitivity in lung cancer. Circulatingautoantibodies to survivin could be a potential biomarker for the early lungcancer diagnosis.DOI: 10.1089/gtmb.2017.0278 PMID: 29924656
