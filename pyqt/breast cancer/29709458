The patients weredivided into different categories according to the recurrence risk predictedusing the California/Van Nuys Prognostic Index (USC/VNPI) score (4-6, 7-9, and10-12), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E5194 criteria, or combinedrisk features with USC/VNPI score and ECOG E5194 criteria. The IBTR anddisease-free survival (DFS) rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Theprognostic effects of age, tumor size, tumor grade, margin width, estrogenreceptor status, USC/VNPI score, low-risk characteristics, and tamoxifen use wereevaluated by log-rank tests.RESULTS: Of the patients, 168 were treated with breast irradiation after BCS and 207 were not. The patients who were treated with radiotherapy (RT) tended to beyounger (< 40 years), to have higher USC/VNPI scores (7-9), and to meet the ECOG E5194 non-cohort 1 criteria. The 7-year risk of IBTR was 6.2% (n = 11) in thepatients who received irradiation and 9.0% (n = 22) in those who did not. DFSrates were better in the patients who underwent RT than in those who did not(93.3% vs. 88.5%, P = .056). Among the patients who underwent BCS alone, age ≥ 40years, margin width > 10 mm, USC/VNPI scores 4-6, ECOG E5194 cohort 1 criteria,estrogen receptor-positive status, and tamoxifen use predicted lower IBTR andbetter DFS rates. In the multivariate analysis, combined low-risk characteristics(USC/VNPI scores 4-6 and meeting the ECOG E5194 cohort 1 criteria) wereidentified as an independent prognostic factor of lower IBTR (P = .028) andbetter DFS (P = .005).CONCLUSION: RT reduces the risk of IBTR after BCS for DCIS of the breast.Patients with combined low-risk characteristics (USC/VNPI scores 4-6 and meeting the ECOG E5194 cohort 1 criteria) may be adequately treated with BCS alone.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
