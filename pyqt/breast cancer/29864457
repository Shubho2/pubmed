Butyl benzylphthalate (BBP) is ubiquitous in human's environment, and is strongly linked tobreast cancer development. microRNA (miRNA) is an important regulator of targetgenes. So far, no studies have been reported yet to reveal the action of miRNAsin BBP-mediated breast cancer cell proliferation. In this study, we showed thatBBP induced proliferation of both ER(+) MCF-7 and ER(-) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, proved by increased cell viability, transition of cell cycle from G1 to S phase, upregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Cyclin D1,and downregulation of p21. Meanwhile, the expression of oncogenic miR-19a/b andPTEN/AKT/p21 axis was also modulated by BBP. Furthermore, for the first time werevealed that miR-19 played crucial role in the promoting effect of BBP on breastcancer cells through targeting PTEN 3'UTR. Findings from this study could providean important new perspective on the molecular mechanisms through which BBP exertsits promoting effect on breast cancer as well as its target intervention.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
