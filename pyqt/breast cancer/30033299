Electronic address:bsbhoop@pu.ac.in.The current studies envisage unravelling the underlying cellular internalisation mechanism of the systematically developed docetaxel (DTH) polyunsaturated fattyacid (PUFA) enriched self-nanoemulsifying lipidic micellar systems (SNELS). Theconcentration-, time- and cytotoxicity-related effects of DTH-SNELS on triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 and non-TNBC MCF-7 cell lines wereassessed through Presto-blue assay. Subsequently, rhodamine-123 (Rh-123) loadedSNELS were employed for evaluating their internalisation through flow cytometryand fluorescence microscopy, establishing it to be "clathrin-mediated" endocytic pathway. Apoptosis assay (65% cell death) and cell cycle distribution (47%inhibition at G2/M phase) further corroborated the cytotoxicity of DTH-SNELStowards cancerous cells. Biodistribution, histopathology and haematology studies indicated insignificant toxicity of the optimized formulation on vital organs.Preclinical anticancer efficacy studies using 7,12-dimethylbenzantracene(DMBA)-induced model construed significant reduction in breast tumor-volume.Overall, extensive in vitro and in vivo studies indicated the intracellularlocalization and cytotoxicity, suggesting DTH-SNELS as promising delivery systemsfor breast tumor therapeutics including TNBC.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
