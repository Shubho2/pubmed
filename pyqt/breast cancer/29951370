The incidence of 24 types of cancer in 39 European countries(2012) was compared with a long-term mean supply of 68 food items from theFAOSTAT database (1993-2011) and some other variables such as smoking, body mass index, raised cholesterol, and socioeconomic indicators. In addition to simplePearson linear correlations, the data were analyzed via factor analyses andpenalized regression methods. This comparison identified two main groups ofcancers that are characteristically associated with the same variables. The firstgroup consists of cancers of the prostate, breast, white blood cells, andmelanoma. Their incidence increases with rising gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, a prevalence of raised cholesterol and a high intake of animal products. The second group includes primarily cancers of the digestive tract and is mostconsistently correlated with alcoholic beverages, lard, and eggs. In addition, wefound specific correlations between certain variables and some other types ofcancer (smoking-lung and larynx cancer; low GDP per capita and high carbohydrate consumption-stomach and cervical cancer; tea drinking-esophageal cancer; maizeconsumption and wine drinking-liver cancer). The documented findings oftenremarkably agree with the current scientific consensus, and when combined withevidence based on different methodologies, they can further extend our knowledge of the etiology of cancer. In addition, our study also identifies several foodswith possible preventive effects and indicates that various dairy products maymarkedly differ in their relationship to cancer incidence. All these data canpotentially be of fundamental importance for clinical practice and the survivalof cancer patients.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00151 PMCID: PMC6008386PMID: 29951370
