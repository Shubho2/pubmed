Growing evidence suggests that pancreaticcancer may be useful as a sentinel cancer to identify families that could benefitfrom HBOC or CRC surveillance, but to date pancreatic cancer is only consideredan indication for genetic testing in the context of additional family history.METHODS: Preliminary data generated at the Huntsman Cancer Hospital (HCH)included variants identified on a custom 34-gene panel or 59-gene panel includingboth known HBOC and CRC genes for respective sets of 66 and 147 pancreatic cancercases, unselected for family history. Given the strength of preliminary data and corresponding literature, 61 sequential pancreatic cancer cases underwent acustom 14-gene clinical panel. Sequencing data from HCH pancreatic cancer cases, pancreatic cancer cases of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and an unselectedpancreatic cancer screen from the Mayo Clinic were combined in a meta-analysis toestimate the proportion of carriers with pathogenic and high probability ofpathogenic variants of uncertain significance (HiP-VUS).RESULTS: Approximately 8.6% of unselected pancreatic cancer cases at the HCHcarried a variant with potential HBOC or CRC screening recommendations. Ameta-analysis of unselected pancreatic cancer cases revealed that approximately11.5% carry a pathogenic variant or HiP-VUS.CONCLUSION: With the inclusion of both HBOC and CRC susceptibility genes in apanel test, unselected pancreatic cancer cases act as a useful sentinel cancer toidentify asymptomatic at-risk relatives who could benefit from relevant HBOC and CRC surveillance measures.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4573-5 PMCID: PMC6020441PMID: 29945567
