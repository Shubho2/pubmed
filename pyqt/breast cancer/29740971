Ten left-breast cancer patients underwentwhole-breast DIBH radiotherapy controlled by the Real-time Position Management(RPM) system. The reproducibility of the tumor bed (i.e., target) was assessed bythe position of implanted clips, acquired through in-room kV imaging. Six toeight passive fiducials were positioned on the patients' thoraco-abdominalsurface and localized intrafractionally by means of an infrared 3D opticaltracking system. The point-based registration between treatment and planningfiducials coordinates was applied to estimate the interfraction variations inpatients' breathing baseline and to improve target reproducibility. The RPM-basedDIBH control resulted in a 3D error in target reproducibility of 5.8 ± 3.4 mm(median value ± interquartile range) across all patients. The reproducibilityerrors proved correlated with the interfraction baseline variations, whichreached 7.7 mm for the single patient. The contribution of surface fiducialsregistration allowed a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.05) in targetlocalization errors, measuring 3.4 ± 1.7 mm in 3D. The 3D optical monitoring ofmultiple surface control points may help to optimize the use of the RPM systemfor improving target reproducibility in left-breast DIBH irradiation, providinginsights on breathing baseline variations and increasing the robustness ofexternal surrogates for DIBH guidance.© 2018 The Authors.
