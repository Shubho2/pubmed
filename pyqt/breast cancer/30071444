[Epubahead of print]Outcomes of long-term responders to anti-programmed death 1 and anti-programmeddeath ligand 1 when being rechallenged with the same anti-programmed death 1 and anti-programmed death ligand 1 at progression.Bernard-Tessier A(1), Baldini C(2), Martin P(2), Champiat S(2), Hollebecque A(2),Postel-Vinay S(2), Varga A(2), Bahleda R(2), Gazzah A(2), Michot JM(2), RibragV(3), Armand JP(2), Marabelle A(2), Soria JC(2), Massard C(4).Author information: (1)Université Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, F-94805, France.(2)Gustave Roussy, Université Paris-Saclay, Drug Development Department (DITEP), Villejuif, F-94805, France.(3)Gustave Roussy, Université Paris-Saclay, Drug Development Department (DITEP), Villejuif, F-94805, France; Université Paris-Saclay, Villejuif, F-94805, France; INSERM, U1170, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, F-94805, France.(4)Gustave Roussy, Université Paris-Saclay, Drug Development Department (DITEP), Villejuif, F-94805, France. Electronic address:christophe.massard@gustaveroussy.fr.BACKGROUND: Long-term responders have been observed with anti-programmed death1 and anti-programmed death ligand 1 (anti-PD(L)1). Optimal duration of therapyin responding and stable disease (SD) patients is unclear with various attitudes encompassing treatment until progression disease, stopping therapy after adefined timeframe.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the experience of 13 patients who discontinuedimmune checkpoint inhibitor in phase I trials as per protocol while experiencing a tumour-controlled disease. According to protocols, patients could restart thesame immunotherapy if radiological or clinical progression occurred.RESULTS: Patients were treated for colorectal microsatellite instability-highgenotype (n = 5), urothelial carcinoma (n = 3), melanoma (n = 2), non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 2) and triple-negative breast cancer (n = 1) for a median timeof 12 months (range 10.6-12). Patients achieved 1 (8%) complete response, 10(77%) partial response (PR) and 2 (15%) SD. The median progression-free survival 1 (PFS1) defined as the time from the first infusion until progression was 24.4months (range 15.8-49). The median time free-treatment after discontinuation was 12.6 months (range 4-39.7). Eight patients experienced disease progression andwere retreated. Best responses observed after rechallenging were 2 PR (25%) and 6SD (75%). Median PFS2 defined from the first day of retreatment until diseaseprogression or the last news was 12.9 months (range 5-35.4). No grade 3/4 events occurred during the study period.CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that anti-PD(L)1 therapy should be resumed ifprogression occurs after a planned anti-PD(L)1 interruption. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejca.2018.06.005 PMID: 30071444
