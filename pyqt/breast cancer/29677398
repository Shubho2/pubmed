We prospectively evaluated associations between life eventstressors, social support, personality characteristics (optimism, anger control, antiemotionality), and risk of developing primary breast cancer (BCa), in womenat increased familial risk of BCa.METHODS: A prospective cohort, repeated measures design was used. Recruitment wasthrough the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into FamilialBreast Cancer, which collects genetic, epidemiological, and clinical data fromAustralasian families with multiple BCa cases. Acute and chronic stressors forthe prior 3 years and psychosocial, clinical, and epidemiological variables were measured at cohort entry and at 3-yearly intervals. Cox proportional hazardregression analysis controlling for BCa risk factors and familial clustering was undertaken. The primary outcome was histopathologically confirmed BCa (invasiveor ductal carcinoma in situ, including occult cases diagnosed duringrisk-reducing mastectomy).RESULTS: Of 3595 consecutive women invited to participate, 3054 (85.0%)consented. Of these, 2739 (89.7%) from 990 families (range 1-16 per family)completed at least 1 assessment point. During the study, 103 women were diagnosedwith BCa. No stressor or psychosocial variable or interaction between them wassignificantly associated with BCa in unadjusted or adjusted models (total acutestressors HR = 1.03 [0.99-1.08], P = .19; total chronic stressors HR = 1.0[0.90-1.11], P = .98).CONCLUSIONS: This study did not demonstrate an association between acute andchronic stressors, social support, optimism, antiemotionality or anger control,and BCa risk. Women should focus on proven methods of BCa risk reduction.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4740 PMID: 29677398
