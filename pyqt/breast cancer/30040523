E5103 tested the effect of bevacizumabin the adjuvant setting in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor2-negative disease. Patients and Methods Patients were assigned 1:2:2 to receive placebo with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by weekly paclitaxel (arm A), bevacizumab only during AC and paclitaxel (arm B), or bevacizumab duringAC and paclitaxel followed by bevacizumab monotherapy for 10 cycles (arm C).Random assignment was stratified and bevacizumab dose adjusted for choice of ACschedule. Radiation and hormonal therapy were administered concurrently withbevacizumab in arm C. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival(IDFS). Results Four thousand nine hundred ninety-four patients were enrolled.Median age was 52 years; 64% of patients were estrogen receptor positive, 27%were lymph node negative, and 78% received dose-dense AC. Chemotherapy-associatedadverse events including myelosuppression and neuropathy were similar across all arms. Grade â‰¥ 3 hypertension was more common in bevacizumab-treated patients, butthrombosis, proteinuria, and hemorrhage were not. The cumulative incidence ofclinical congestive heart failure at 15 months was 1.0%, 1.9%, and 3.0% in armsA, B, and C, respectively. Bevacizumab exposure was less than anticipated, withapproximately 24% of patients in arm B and approximately 55% of patients in arm Cdiscontinuing bevacizumab before completing planned therapy. Five-year IDFS was77% (95% CI, 71% to 81%) in arm A, 76% (95% CI, 72% to 80%) in arm B, and 80%(95% CI, 77% to 83%) in arm C. Conclusion Incorporation of bevacizumab intosequential anthracycline- and taxane-containing adjuvant therapy does not improveIDFS or overall survival in patients with high-risk human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2-negative breast cancer. Longer duration bevacizumab therapy isunlikely to be feasible given the high rate of early discontinuation.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2018.79.2028 PMID: 30040523
