IL-34 plays a role in innate immunity,inflammation, and cancer. However, the role of IL-34 in breast cancer is stillill-defined. We analyzed IL-34 mRNA expression in breast cancer cell lines andbreast cancer patients and applied established computational approaches(CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, TIMER, TCIA), to analyze gene expression data from TheCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Expression of IL-34 was associated with a favorableprognosis in luminal and HER2 but not basal breast cancer patients. Geneexpression of CSF-1 and CSF-1R was strongly associated with myeloid cellinfiltration, while we found no or only weak correlations between IL-34, PTPRZ1, syndecan-1 and myeloid cells. In vitro experiments showed that tyrosinephosphorylation of CSF-1R, ERK, and FAK and cell migration are differentiallyregulated by IL-34 and CSF-1 in breast cancer cell lines. Collectively, our data suggest that correlation of IL-34 gene expression with survival is dependent onthe molecular breast cancer subtype. Furthermore, IL-34 is not associated withmyeloid cell infiltration and directly regulates breast cancer cell migration andsignaling.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25226 PMCID: PMC5955405PMID: 29796177
