Four VMAT plans were generated retrospectively for 10 patients withbreast cancer for comparison. First, 2 partial arcs with an avoidance sector(Pavoid) for the lung and the heart were created. Second, a split-arc design with2 partial arcs was used, changing the collimator angle by splitting the arcs inthe middle, resulting in 4 partial arcs (Psplit). Third, the arc angles in thePsplit were modified to emphasize tangential directions, corresponding to theavoidance sector in Pavoid, resulting in 2 lateral and 2 anterior partial arcs.Furthermore, a fifth arc was added to ensure the coverage of axillary lymph nodes(Ptang). Fourth, one of the anterior arcs was removed to limit the number of arcsduring treatment (Ptang-1). PTV coverage was the highest in Psplit with aV90%(PTV) of 98.4 ± 0.6%. Also the dose homogeneity and conformity were the best (p < 0.02) in Psplit, and a smaller high-dose volume was distributed to theipsilateral lung, heart, and humeral head, than in the other designs. In Ptangand Ptang-1, the PTV coverage was acceptable with V90%(PTV) of 97.9 ± 0.8% and98.0 ± 0.8%, respectively, and low-dose volumes in normal tissue were smallercompared with Psplit. The removal of 1 partial arc from Ptang (Ptang-1) did nothave a significant effect on dose parameters. In Pavoid, the contralateral breastand lung volumes of low-dose level were the smallest. However, the PTV coveragewas reduced (V90% = 97.0 ± 1.6%), and the heart, ipsilateral lung, and humeralhead received significantly higher doses than in other designs. The modifiedsplit-arc methods Ptang and Ptang-1, emphasizing tangential directions, wereclose to the original split-arc method in PTV coverage while reducing the dose tothe healthy tissues distant from the PTV. Ptang-1 is seen as a favorabletreatment option over Ptang with less treatment time.Copyright © 2018 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists. Published byElsevier Inc.
