Of over 20 FA-linked genes, FANCJ uniquely encodes aDNA helicase and mutations are also associated with breast and ovarian cancer.fancj-/- cells are sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-linking (ICL) andreplication fork stalling drugs. We delineated the molecular defects of two FApatient-derived FANCJ helicase domain mutations. FANCJ-R707C was compromised indimerization and helicase processivity, whereas DNA unwinding by FANCJ-H396D was barely detectable. DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis was defective for bothFANCJ-R707C and FANCJ-H396D, the latter showing greater reduction. Expression of FANCJ-R707C or FANCJ-H396D in fancj-/- cells failed to rescue cisplatin ormitomycin sensitivity. Live-cell imaging demonstrated a significantly compromisedrecruitment of FANCJ-R707C to laser-induced DNA damage. However, FANCJ-R707Cexpressed in fancj-/- cells conferred resistance to the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin, G-quadruplex ligand telomestatin, or DNA strand-breaker bleomycin,whereas FANCJ-H396D failed. Thus, a minimal threshold of FANCJ catalytic activityis required to overcome replication stress induced by aphidicolin ortelomestatin, or to repair bleomycin-induced DNA breakage. These findings haveimplications for therapeutic strategies relying on DNA cross-link sensitivity or heightened replication stress characteristic of cancer cells.DOI: 10.1093/nar/gky403 PMID: 29788478
