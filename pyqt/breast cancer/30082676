Apart from their relation with inflammation, the additional involvement of COX-2 enzyme with cancer activity was recently discovered. In some cancer typesthe level of COX-2 enzyme is increased indicating that this enzyme could be asuitable target for cancer therapy. Based on these findings, we have synthesized some new diflunisal thiosemicarbazides and 1,2,4-triazoles and tested themagainst androgen-independent prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3), colon carcinoma(HCT-116), human breast cancer (T47D), breast carcinoma (MCF7) and humanembryonic kidney (HEK-293) cell lines. Specifically, the diflunisal andthiosemicarbazide functionality are combined during the synthesis of originalcompounds anticipating a potency enhancement. Compounds 6, 10, 15 and 16 did not show cytotoxic effects for the HEK293 cell line. Among them, compounds 15 and 16 demonstrated anticancer activity for the breast cancer cell line T47D, whereascompounds 6 and 10 which are thiosemicarbazide derivatives displayedanti-tumourigenic activity against the PC-3 cell line, consistent with theliterature. However, no activity was observed for the HCT-116 cancer cell linewith the tested thiosemicarbazide derivatives. Only compound 16 displayedactivity against the HCT-116 cell line. Therefore, it was speculated that thediflunisal and thiosemicarbazide functionalities potentiate anticancer activityon prostate cancer and the thiosemicarbazide functionality decreases theanticancer activity of diflunisal on colon cancer cell lines. In order to gaininsight into the anticancer activity and COX-2 inhibition, molecular dockingstudies were carried out for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes utilizing the newlysynthesized compounds 15, and 16. Both 15 and 16 showed high selectivity andaffinity toward COX-2 isozyme over COX-1, which is in agreement with theexperimental results.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23081969 PMID: 30082676
