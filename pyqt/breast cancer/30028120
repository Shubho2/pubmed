Owing to theability of let-7a to repress DNA repair mechanisms (e.g., BRCA1 and BRCA2) anddownregulate drug efflux pumps (e.g., ABCG2), delivery of let-7a could sensitize chemoresistant breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) to subsequent doxorubicinchemotherapy both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the multifunctionality of ourMCNPs allows for the monitoring of in vivo delivery via magnetic resonanceimaging. In short, we have developed a multifunctional MCNP-based therapeuticapproach to provide an attractive method with which to enhance our ability notonly to deliver combined miRNA therapeutics with small-molecule drugs in bothselective and effective manner but also to sensitize cancer cells for theenhanced treatment via the combination of miRNA replacement therapy using asingle nanoplatform.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b09086 PMID: 30028120
