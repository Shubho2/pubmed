China.Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug and possesses anti-angiogenic andimmunomodulatory activities against multiple myeloma. The present study assessed the in vitro effect of lenalidomide combined with cisplatin on MDA-MB-231, atriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line and explored the underlyingmolecular mechanism of this combination. Cell viability, apoptosis and theprotein expression of phosphorylated (p) and total extracellular signal-regulatedkinase (ERK), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), caspase-3, cleaved poly-adenosinediphosphate-ribose polymerase (cPARP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were measured in MDA-MB-231 cellstreated with different concentrations of lenalidomide, cisplatin and theircombination using different biochemical assays. Lenalidomide demonstrated nosignificant effect on the cell viability of MDA-MB-231 cells, even at highconcentrations, whereas lenalidomide in combination with cisplatin, significantlyreduced cisplatin IC50 from 7.8 to 3.0 ÂµM in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition,lenalidomide and cisplatin in combination significantly induced cell apoptosis by1.6- and 1.38-fold, respectively compared with lenalidomide and cisplatin alone(P<0.05). The expression levels of VEGF, bFGF and Bcl-2 proteins weresignificantly reduced (P<0.01), whereas caspase-3 and cleaved PARP expressionwere significantly increased in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with the combinationcompared to those treated with single agents (P<0.01). Lenalidomide treatmentalone significantly reduced the p-ERK level compared with the control (P<0.05)and cisplatin treatment alone significantly increased it (P<0.01), howevertreatment with them in combination significantly reduced the p-ERK level inMDA-MB-231 cells compared with cisplatin treatment alone (P<0.05). In conclusion,the present study provides the basis for using lenalidomide in combination withcisplatin in TNBC therapy.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8120 PMCID: PMC5876447PMID: 29616116
