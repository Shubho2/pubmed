Electronic address: chern.oon@usm.my.Molecular targeted therapies are revolutionized therapeutics which interfere withspecific molecules to block cancer growth, progression, and metastasis. Manymolecular targeted therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have demonstrated remarkable clinical success in the treatment of a myriad ofcancer types including breast, leukemia, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancers.This review provides an update on the different types of molecular targetedtherapies used in the treatment of cancer, focusing on the fundamentals ofmolecular targeted therapy, its mode of action in cancer treatment, as well asits advantages and limitations.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
