DWI data for 34 patients with BMs from breast cancerwere retrospectively reviewed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogramparameters were calculated from all measurable BMs. Two region of interest (ROI) methods are used for the analysis: from the largest BM or from all measurable BMsper one patient. ADC histogram parameters were compared between positive andnegative groups depending on ER/PR and HER2 statuses. Overall survival analysisafter BM (OSBM) and BM-specific progression-free survival (BMPFS) was analyzedwith ADC parameters. Regardless of ROI methods, 25th percentile of ADC histogram was significantly lower in the ER/PR-positive group than in the ER/PR-negativegroup (P < 0.05). Using ROIs from all measurable BMs, Peak location, 50thpercentile, 75th percentile, and mean value of ADC histogram were alsosignificantly lower in the ER/PR-positive group than in the ER/PR-negative group (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between HER2-postive andnegative group. On univariate analysis, using ROIs from all measurable BMs, lower25th percentile, 50th percentile and mean of ADC were significant predictors for poor BMPFS. ADC histogram analysis may have a prognostic value over ER/PR status as well as BMPFS.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-28315-y PMCID: PMC6028481PMID: 29967409
