This paradigm shift is associated with a controversial debate regarding the significance of axillary staging, the need for surgery, and the role of radiotherapy. Looking ahead, lymph node staging and axillarytreatment might shift from SLNB and/or axillary dissection to ultrasound-guidedneedle biopsy and irradiation of regional lymph nodes in order to reducetreatment-related sequelae in early-stage breast cancer.DOI: 10.1159/000489892 PMCID: PMC6062724 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 30069177
