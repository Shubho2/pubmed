To assessthe association between SNPs that reside in regions of lincRNAs and breast cancerrisk, we performed a large case-control study in China.METHODS: We carried out a two-stage case-control study including 2881 breastcancer cases and 3220 controls. In stage I, we genotyped 17 independent(r2 < 0.5) SNPs located in 6 tumor-related lincRNAs by using the TaqMan platform.In stage II, SNPs potentially associated with breast cancer risk were replicated in an independent population. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure H19 levels in tissues from 228 breast cancer patients with different genotypes.RESULTS: We identified 2 SNPs significantly associated with breast cancer risk instage I (P < 0.05), but not significantly replicated in stage II. We combined thedata from stage I and stage II, and found that, compared with the rs2071095 CCgenotype, AA and CA + AA genotypes were associated with significantly decreasedrisk of breast cancer (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-0.99; adjusted OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.98, respectively). Stratified analyses showed that rs2071095 wasassociated with breast cancer risk in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients(P = 0.002), but not in ER-negative ones (P = 0.332). Expression levels of H19 inbreast cancer cases with AA genotype were significantly lower than those with CC genotype.CONCLUSIONS: We identified that rs2071095 may contribute to the susceptibility ofbreast cancer in Chinese women via affecting H19 expression. The mechanismsunderlying the association remain to be investigated.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4814-y PMID: 29737472
