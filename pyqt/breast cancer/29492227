The purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the relationship between BRCA1 polymorphisms (rs799917, rs1799950,rs1799966, or rs16941) and cancer risk. Relevant studies were identified via asystematic search of the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases up to July 31, 2017. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculatedto examine the strength of the associations. Thirty-five studies published in 19 publications involving 28,094 cases and 50,657 controls were included in thismeta-analysis. There was no obvious association between rs799917, rs1799966, orrs16941 polymorphisms and overall cancer risk in any genetic models. However,subgroup analyses revealed that the rs799917 polymorphism could decrease the riskof cervical cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cancer,and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) among Asian populations in one or more geneticmodels and that rs16941 could increase overall cancer risk among Caucasianpopulations in the homozygote and recessive models. Our meta-analysis alsoindicated that rs1799950 could decrease the breast cancer (BC) risk amongCaucasian populations in the homozygote and recessive models. In summary, ourresults suggest that BRCA1 polymorphisms may play an important role in theetiology of cancer. However, due to the limited number of studies, these findingsshould be confirmed by new studies with larger sample sizes that address various types of cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24064 PMCID: PMC5823592PMID: 29492227
