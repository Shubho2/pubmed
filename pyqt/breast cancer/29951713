Resources can play an important role inthis adjustment process, but research on this topic is limited, especially forvery long-term survivors. This study explores, which resources are mostfrequently indicated by different subgroups of cancer survivors, and what roleresources play for functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQL) incancer survivors with and without recurrence.METHODS: The sample of 6030 breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivors(5-16 years post-diagnosis) was recruited in a German multi-regionalpopulation-based study. Personal resources were assessed by a 27-item checklist; HRQL was assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment ofCancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). General linearmodels were used to analyze associations of resources with HRQL.RESULTS: Participants indicated on average 11.4 (SD 5.1) resources as helpful.Family, activities with others, and partnership were indicated most commonlyoverall, but frequencies varied according to age, sex, and tumor site. Physicalactivity, health, professional help, calmness, hope, optimism, and hobbies weremost important in explaining HRQL variance. Cancer survivors with recurrence and many resources were found to report similar HRQL as survivors without recurrence and only few resources.CONCLUSIONS: The study underlines the importance and situational variability ofpersonal and social resources for cancer survivors' HRQL, even yearspost-diagnosis. Not only the availability, but also the individual perception andsignificance of resources should be considered in follow-up cancer care.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4317-8 PMID: 29951713
