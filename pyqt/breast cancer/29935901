Electronicaddress: atf2116@cumc.columbia.edu.With 40,920 American women expected to die from breast cancer in 2018 and global health estimates that more than 508,000 women died in 2011 from this disease, theidentification of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of breast cancercannot be ignored. A breakthrough class of cancer drugs that has emerged inrecent years and has had an impact in the treatment of breast cancer are thecyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, with palbociclib the firstin class to have received regulatory approval for breast cancer. In this article we will compare and contrast three CDK4/6 inhibitors - palbociclib, ribocicliband abemaciclib - that have received regulatory approval for the treatment ofmetastatic breast cancer. Ribociclib and abemaciclib developed after the success of palbociclib represent examples of "me-too" therapies increasingly beingdeployed in oncology.Copyright Â© 2017.
