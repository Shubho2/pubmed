Although the risk with modern radiation treatment is likely tobe lower in these patient groups, cardiotoxicity is still observed in a subset ofpatients. In addition, radiation-associated cardiovascular complications can, in the future, extend to other groups of cancer patients who are treated for tumors that are localized near the heart. Areas covered: The authors briefly describethe most commonly observed types of RICVD. They then present an overview ofpreclinical animal and cellular models that have been used to investigate themechanisms underlying RICVD pathophysiology. The beneficial effects of available drugs, and potential targets for new molecules are also reported. Expert opinion:There is a need to develop cardio-oncological programs and pharmacotherapiesspecifically targeting RICVD. Beyond statins, ACE inhibitors, anti-inflammatoryand antioxidant agents, preclinical studies indicate that TGFβ receptor Iinhibitors, Sestrin2 inducers, recombinant neuregulin-1 and miR-21 inhibitorsmight represent novel promising strategies. In order to properly determine theoptimal therapeutic index for these molecules, in vivo models combining cancerand RICVD should be envisioned.DOI: 10.1080/14656566.2018.1446080 PMID: 29494295  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
