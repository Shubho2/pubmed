Image qualityis lost due to the quality assurance programs are not implemented. We carried outan exploratory survey of thirty-six new (FFDM) units from a single manufacturerinstalled in several cities of the Mexican Republic with two types oftarget/filter combination (Mo/Mo and W/Rh). Tests were performed according toNOM-041-SSA1-2011 (Mexico), the regulation indicates that all facilities usingdigital mammography systems must maintain a QC program equal to the QC programrecommended by the manufacturer. However, QC program recommended by themanufacturer meets with FDA and ACR Regulations. Digital mammography unitsevaluated exceeds quality image standards established by the ACR and FDA, eventhough, the W/Rh combination achieved a higher performance and reduces theaverage glandular dose. All mammography units met the quality control standardsestablished by ACR, FDA and Mexican regulations. Then, the objective of thisstudy was to evaluate the initial image quality and compliances with themanufacturer's quality control specifications before use it in patients in newfull-field 2D digital mammography (FFDM) units and compares average glandulardose (AGD) with FFDM units using different anode/filter combinations (Mo/Mo andW/Rh).Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
