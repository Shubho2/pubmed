Wehypothesized that abnormalities in patient metabolism, such as obesity anddiabetes, may drive outcomes in breast cancer patients with brain metastases.METHODS: We retrospectively identified 84 consecutive patients with brainmetastases from breast cancer treated with intracranial radiation therapy.Radiation was delivered as whole-brain radiation to a median dose of 3000 cGy or stereotactic radiosurgery to a median dose of 2100 cGy. Kaplan Meier curves were generated for overall survival (OS) data and Mantel-Cox regression was performed to detect differences in groups.RESULTS: At analysis, 81 survival events had occurred and the median OS for theentire cohort was 21.7 months. Despite similar modified graded prognosticassessments, resection rates, and receptor status, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (n = 45) wasassociated with decreased median OS (13.7 vs. 30.6 months; p < 0.001) and median intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) (7.4 vs. 10.9 months; p = 0.04)compared to patients with BMI < 25 kg/m2 (n = 39). Similar trends were observedamong all three types of breast cancer. Patients with diabetes (n = 17) haddecreased median OS (11.8 vs. 26.2 months; p < 0.001) and median intracranial PFS(4.5 vs. 10.3 months; p = 0.001) compared to non-diabetics (n = 67). Onmultivariate analysis, both BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 [HR 2.35 (1.39-3.98); p = 0.002] anddiabetes [HR 2.77 (1.454-5.274); p = 0.002] were associated with increasedmortality.CONCLUSIONS: Elevated BMI or diabetes may negatively impact both overall survivaland local control in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer,highlighting the importance of the translational development of therapeuticmetabolic interventions. Given its prognostic significance, BMI should be used asa stratification in future clinical trial design in this patient population.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4880-1 PMID: 30022328
