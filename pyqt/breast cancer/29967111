[Epub ahead of print]CHP2 Promotes Cell Proliferation in Breast Cancer via Suppression of FOXO3a.Zhao X(1), Xie T(2), Dai T(3), Zhao W(4), Li J(5), Xu R(6), Jiang C(7), Li P(5), Deng J(8), Su X(5), Ma N(9).Author information: (1)GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University.(2)Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University.(3)Department of Biotechnology,GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University.(4)Juancheng People's Hospital.(5)Guangzhou Medical University.(6)Department of Internal Medicine, Cancer Center of Guangzhou MedicalUniversity.(7)People's Hospital of Baoan District.(8)Southern Medical University.(9)Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation School of Basic MedicalSciences, Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University ningfangma18@163.com.Calcineurin B homologous protein isoform 2 (CHP2), an essential cofactor forNa+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1), is identified to be expressed in variousmalignant cell lines. However, the clinical significance and biological role ofCHP2 in breast cancer remain to be established. Here, CHP2 was markedlyoverexpressed in breast cancer cells and clinical tumor specimens.Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis revealed that the expression of CHP2 wassignificantly correlated with patients' clinicopathologic characteristics likeclinical stage, and breast cancer patients with high CHP2 expression had shorter overall survival compared to patients with low CHP2 expression. Moreover, it was demonstrated that overexpressing CHP2 significantly enhanced, whereas silencingendogenous CHP2 inhibited, the proliferation and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, overexpression of CHP2 accelerated,while inhibition of CHP2 retarded, G1-S-phase cell cycle transition in breastcancer cells. Mechanistically, overexpression of CHP2 activated AKT signaling andsuppressed the transactivation of the forkhead box O3 (FOXO3/FOXO3a)transcription factor.IMPLICATIONS: This study discovers a previously unrecognizedrole of CHP2 in the progression of breast cancer and supports the significance ofthis gene as a novel prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0157 PMID: 29967111
