Electronic address: luciana.neamtiu@ec.europa.eu.International guidelines recommend assessing women's satisfaction with breastcancer screening programmes; however, validated tools are needed. A systematicreview to identify and evaluate the quality of validated instruments forscreening satisfaction, from 01/1965 until 11/2017 was performed. From 3283individual citations, six instruments were identified. Evaluation of theMammoGraphy Questionnaire using the COSMIN checklist resulted in 'good' to'excellent' scores in most assessed domains, while the other tools were mostly'poor'/'fair' quality or did not provide enough information for assessment.Nevertheless, substantial changes in screening processes and programmes have beenimplemented in recent years. Thus, further development work is needed.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.DOI: 10.1016/j.breast.2018.03.001 PMID: 29533883
