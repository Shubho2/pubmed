It is not clear why people with the same type of breast cancer respond to treatments differently; some escape from dormancy andrelapse earlier than others. In addition, some tumor clones respond toimmunotherapy while others do not. We investigated how autophagy plays a role in accelerating or delaying recurrence of neu-overexpressing mouse mammary carcinoma(MMC) following adriamycin (ADR) treatment, and in affecting response toimmunotherapy. We explored two strategies: 1) transient blockade of autophagywith chloroquine (CQ), which blocks fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes duringADR treatment, and 2) permanent inhibition of autophagy by a stable knockdown of ATG5 (ATG5KD), which inhibits the formation of autophagosomes in MMC during andafter ADR treatment. We found that while CQ prolonged tumor dormancy, but thatstable knockdown of autophagy resulted in early escape from dormancy andrecurrence. Interestingly, ATG5KD MMC contained an increased frequency ofADR-induced polyploid-like cells and rendered MMC resistant to immunotherapy. On the other hand, a transient blockade of autophagy did not affect the sensitivity of MMC to immunotherapy. Our observations suggest that while chemotherapy-inducedautophagy may facilitate tumor relapse, cell-intrinsic autophagy delays tumorrelapse, in part, by inhibiting the formation of polyploid-like tumor dormancy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25197 PMCID: PMC5955162PMID: 29774126
