We report the chemical bioconjugation and shape shifting of a hollow, rod-shaped tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) to dense sphericalnanoparticles (SNPs). We describe methods to transform TMV rods to spheres, load TMV rods and spheres with the chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin (DOX), todeliver modified particles to breast cancer cells, and to determine the IC50values of the plant virus-based drug delivery system.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7808-3_28 PMID: 29869258
