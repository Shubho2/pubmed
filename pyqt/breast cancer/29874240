The present study demonstrated that the low molecular weightsubfractions III exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity towards breastcarcinoma cells MDA-MB-231, prostatic carcinoma cells PC3, and breast cancercells MCF7 with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 52,25μg/mL, 60,66 μg/mL, and 54,92 μg/mL, respectively. The highest percentage ofinhibition was noted at a concentration of 300 μg/mL in all the examined tumorlines. A significant percentage (59.08%) of ex-LMSIII inhibition of theMDA-MB-231 tumor line was reached at a concentration of 15 μg/ml, while theconcentration applied did not affect normal human fibroblast cells. The lowmolecular weight subfraction III was the most effective and additionally showedthe highest free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl scavenging activity (IC5020.39 μg/mL) followed by the low molecular weight subfraction I (IC50 64.14μg/mL) and II (IC50 49.22 μg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the testedpreparations was evaluated against three microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis,Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The MIC minimal inhibitoryconcentration (MIC) values for the low molecular weight subfraction I, II, andIII showed a stronger inhibition effect on S. aureus than on B. subtilis and E.coli cells. The MIC values for the low molecular weight subfraction II against S.aureus, B. subtilis, and E. coli were 6.25, 12.5, and 100 mg/mL, respectively.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197044 PMCID: PMC5991343PMID: 29874240
