The benefit of combiningthese approaches has been examined in mouse models and shown to improvepathological measures of disease over single treatment; however, the impact oncellular and cognitive functions affected by Aβ has not been tested. We used acontrollable APP transgenic mouse model to test whether combining geneticsuppression of Aβ production with passive anti-Aβ immunization improvedfunctional outcomes over either treatment alone. Compared with behavior beforetreatment, arresting further Aβ production (but not passive immunization) wassufficient to stop further decline in spatial learning, working memory, andassociative memory, whereas combination treatment reversed each of theseimpairments. Cognitive improvement coincided with resolution of neuriticdystrophy, restoration of synaptic density surrounding deposits, and reduction ofhyperactive mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Computational modelingcorroborated by in vivo microdialysis pointed to the reduction ofsoluble/exchangeable Aβ as the primary driver of cognitive recovery.© 2018 Chiang et al.DOI: 10.1084/jem.20171484 PMCID: PMC5940263 [Available on 2018-11-07]PMID: 29626114
