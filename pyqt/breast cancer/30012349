Electronic address: penning@upenn.edu.Aldo-Keto-Reductase 1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase(HSD)/prostaglandin (PG) F2α synthase) is the only 17β-HSD that is not ashort-chain dehydrogenase/reductase. By acting as a 17-ketosteroid reductase,AKR1C3 produces potent androgens in peripheral tissues which activate theandrogen receptor (AR) or act as substrates for aromatase. AKR1C3 is implicatedin the production of androgens in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) andpolycystic ovarian syndrome; and is implicated in the production of aromatasesubstrates in breast cancer. By acting as an 11-ketoprostaglandin reductase,AKR1C3 provides PGF epimers to activate the FP receptor and deprives peroxisomeproliferator activator receptorγ of its putative PGJ2 ligands. These growthstimulatory signals implicate AKR1C3 in non-hormonal dependent malignancies e.g. acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AKR1C3 moonlights by acting as a co-activator ofthe AR and stabilizes ubiquitin ligases. AKR1C3 inhibitors have been usedclinically for CRPC and AML and can be used to probe its pluripotency.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.DOI: 10.1016/j.mce.2018.07.002 PMID: 30012349
