However, the therapeutic targets and signaling cascades modulated by curcumin have been enigmatic despite extensive research. Here we identifydual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2), a positive regulator of the26S proteasome, as a direct target of curcumin. Curcumin occupies the ATP-bindingpocket of DYRK2 in the cocrystal structure, and it potently and specificallyinhibits DYRK2 over 139 other kinases tested in vitro. As a result, curcumindiminishes DYRK2-mediated 26S proteasome phosphorylation in cells, leading toreduced proteasome activity and impaired cell proliferation. Interestingly,curcumin synergizes with the therapeutic proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib toinduce apoptosis in a variety of proteasome-addicted cancer cells, while thisdrug combination exhibits modest to no cytotoxicity to noncancerous cells. In abreast cancer xenograft model, curcumin treatment significantly reduces tumorburden in immunocompromised mice, showing a similar antitumor effect asCRISPR/Cas9-mediated DYRK2 depletion. These results reveal an unexpected role of curcumin in DYRK2-proteasome inhibition and provide a proof-of-concept thatpharmacological manipulation of proteasome regulators may offer new opportunitiesfor anticancer treatment.Copyright Â© 2018 the Author(s).
