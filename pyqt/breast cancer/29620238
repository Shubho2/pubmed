China.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that play an importantrole in gene regulation and are critically involved in the pathogenesis andprogression of human cancer. miR-328-5p has been reported to potentially act as asensitising agent in breast cancer, but its other cellular functions andmechanisms remain unknown. The primary aim of the present study was to discoveradditional cellular functions and mechanisms of miR-328-5p in the breast cancercell line MDA-MB-231. In the present study, miRNA microarray was used to findaltered miRNAs. MTT and colony formation were used to test cell proliferation.Flow cytometry and western blotting were used to explore potential mechanisms of miR-328-5p regulating cell proliferation. A luciferase reporter assay was used toconfirm target binding. miR-328-5p was revealed to be significantly upregulatedafter knockdown of the receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGE).We also confirmed that miR-328-5p was frequently decreased in breast cancertissues. Moreover, miR-328-5p mimics inhibited MDA-MB-231 proliferation, drugresistance and cell cycle progression. We confirmed that RAGE was a direct targetof miR-328-5p. Functions of miR-328-5p in MDA-MB‑231 cells were elucidated bytargeting RAGE. In conclusion, these results revealed that miR-328-5p may beconsidered as a tumour-suppressor factor, and promoting miR-328-5p expressioncould be a novel therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/or.2018.6353 PMID: 29620238
