Due to the undesirable side effects of AR agonists, attempts have been undertaken to develop selective AR modulators. One of these compounds isCl-4AS-1. This study examined this compound more closely at the cellular andmolecular levels.METHODS: Three different breast cancer cell lines were utilized, namely theluminal MCF-7 cells, the molecular apocrine MDA-MB-453 cells, and the triplenegative, basal MDA-MB-231 cells.RESULTS: High and significant concordance between dihydrotestosterone (DHT) andCl-4AS-1 in regulation of gene expression in MDA-MB-453 cells was found. However,some differences were noted including the expression of AR, which was upregulatedby DHT, but not Cl-4AS-1. In addition, both DHT and Cl-4AS-1 caused a similarmorphological change and reorganization of the actin structure of MDA-MB-453cells into a mesenchymal phenotype. Treatment of cells with DHT resulted ininduction of proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells, but no effect wasobserved on the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. On the other hand, increasing dosesof Cl-4AS-1 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition on the growth of the threecell lines. This inhibition was a result of induction of apoptosis wherebyCl-4AS-1 caused a block in entry of cells into the S-phase followed by DNAdegradation.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that although Cl-4AS-1 has characteristics ofclassical AR agonist, it has dissimilar properties that may make it useful intreating breast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/07435800.2018.1455105 PMID: 29578828
