The resultingsupramolecular micellar assembly is about 30 nm in diameter with a polydispersityindex <0.1, stable for more than 72 h, and exhibits excellent preservation of thephotochemical properties of the two photoresponsive components, even though they are confined within the same host nanocarrier. Appropriate regulation of therelative concentrations of these components makes them capable of absorbingvisible light in comparable amounts, leading to effective simultaneousphotogeneration of singlet oxygen and photo-triggered release of CAB. This "ondemand" release of cytotoxic combinations results in amplified anticanceractivity against MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
