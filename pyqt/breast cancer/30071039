Of thesesubtypes, those expressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)receptor were traditionally associated with poor prognosis. Several advances havebeen made in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, yet issues ofresistance and poor response to therapy remains prevalent. In this study weexplored the impact of HER-family and homologous recombination deficiency SNPs onresponse to patients who received TCH-based (docetaxel (T), carboplatin (C), and trastuzumab (H)) treatment versus those who received other treatment regimens.Using Cox regression analysis, we identified 6 SNPs that correlate withrecurrence free survival in our patients and supported our findings using supportvector machines. We also used reverse phase protein array analysis to examine theimpact ERBB3 SNPs may have on both the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. Finally, using cell line models, we correlated SNP status with sensitivity toplatinum based drugs and docetaxel. We found that patients on a TCH based regimenwith the minor allele of the ERBB3 (rs2229046 and rs773123) and BARD1 (rs2070096)SNPs, were significantly more likely to relapse than those women who were not.Additionally, we observed that patients with these ERBB3 SNPs had shown elevated protein expression/phosphorylation of Src kinase, c-MET (Y1234/1235), GSK-3β (S9)and p27, indicating that these SNPs are associated with non-PI3K/AKT signaling.Finally, using cell line models, we demonstrate that the BARD1 SNP (rs2229571) isassociated with greater sensitivity to both carboplatin and cisplatin. The BARD1 and ERBB3 SNPs can potentially be used to determine those patients that will havea worse response to TCH based treatment, an effect that may arise from the SNPsimpact on altered cellular signaling.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200996 PMID: 30071039
