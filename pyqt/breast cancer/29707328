The aims of this retrospective study were to evaluatethe value of PET/CT and identify novel prognostic indicators for pulmonarymetastasectomy.Methods: Between May 2004 and February 2017, 178 patients underwent PET/CT andresection of pulmonary metastases. After exclusion of patients who underwentbiopsy only or duplicate cases, 142 patients were analyzed. Prognosticindicators, including PET/CT findings and outcomes were investigated.Results: The median follow-up time was 42 months. The primary tumor site wascolorectal in 76, kidney in 14, head and neck in 13, breast in 12, stomach in 8, urinary tract in 7, and other organs in 12 patients. The median maximalstandardized uptake value (SUVmax) was 4.6. The optimal cut-off value, determinedby receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, identified the followingcut-off values: disease-free interval (DFI) (12 months; SUVmax =4.5). Univariableanalysis revealed that DFI ≤12 months, incomplete resection, and SUVmax ≥4.5 weresignificant for poor outcome. Multivariable analysis revealed incompleteresection and SUVmax ≥4.5 were significant for poor outcome. The 5-year survival rates of patients with SUVmax ≥4.5 and SUVmax <4.5 were 51.6% and 74.0%,respectively.Conclusions: Analysis of patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomydemonstrated that incomplete resection and an SUVmax ≥4.5 are significantprognostic indicators. PET/CT findings should be included in estimations of thesepatients' prognosis.DOI: 10.21037/jtd.2018.02.61 PMCID: PMC5906246PMID: 29707328
