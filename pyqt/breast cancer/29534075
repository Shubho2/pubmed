However, the association of this mutation with cancer remainscontroversial. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to characterize thisrelationship.MATERIALS AND METHODS/MAIN RESULTS: A systematic search of studies on theassociation of TERT rs2853669 polymorphism with all types of cancer was conductedin PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library. The summary odds ratios (ORs) andcorresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to pool the effectsize in a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model where appropriate. Atotal of 13 articles and 15 case-control studies, including 9,157 cases and11,073 controls, were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled resultsindicated that the rs2853669 polymorphism was significantly associated withincreased cancer risk in a homozygote comparison model (CT vs. TT: OR = 1.085,95% CI: 1.015-1.159, P = 0.016). In the stratified analyses, a significantincreased cancer risk was observed in Asian, but not Caucasian patients. Asubgroup analysis by cancer type also revealed a significant increase in the riskof lung cancer, but not breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that the TERT rs2853669polymorphism is associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer,particularly lung cancer, in Asian populations.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0191560 PMCID: PMC5849304PMID: 29534075  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
