Out of 124, 47 benign and 77 malignantlesions were confirmed by pathological diagnosis. The diagnostic performance off, D, and D* value to distinguish benign from malignant breast lesions, wasevaluated using pathological results as the gold standard. Correlation between D value and Ki-67 index was evaluated to predict grading of malignant breastlesions.RESULTS: The D value (0.99 ± 0.21) of patients with malignant lesions wassignificantly lower than that (1.34 ± 0.18) of patients harboring benign lesions (P = .00). The D* value (7.60 ± 2.10) in malignant lesion group was higher thanthat (6.83 ± 2.13) of the benign lesion group (P = .113). The f value(8.50 ± 2.13) in malignant lesion group was remarkably higher than that(7.68 ± 1.98) of benign lesion group (P = .035). For differential diagnosis ofbenign from malignant breast lesions, optimal diagnostic threshold of D value andf value were 1.21 and 7.86, respectively. The areas of D and f values under theROC curve were 0.883 and 0.601, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, andaccuracy of D value were 83.0%, 86.7%, and 85.5%, respectively. Accordingly,those indexes of f value were 64.9%, 57.4%, and 62.1%, respectively. Furthermore,the Ki-67 staining index of malignant lesions was robustly negatively correlated with D value (r = -0.395, P < .01).CONCLUSION: Concrete parameters of IVIM-DWI can help to improve the specificityand accuracy in differential diagnosis of breast benign and malignant lesions. D value is most relevant and valuable in predicting the grading of malignant breastlesions.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011109 PMCID: PMC6039593PMID: 29952951  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
