China.Angiogenic activity in solid tumors has been demonstrated to promote metastasisthrough the activation of certain proteins involved in the epithelial-mesenchymaltransition-associated process. The molecular mechanism underlying multiplemyeloma-induced angiogenesis involves angiogenic cytokines by plasma cells aswell as their induction within the microenvironment. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK)is a highly evolutionarily conserved intracellular protein that was originallyidentified as an integrin-interacting protein, and extensive genetic andbiochemical studies have identified ILK expression to be vital duringtumor-driven angiogenesis. In the present study, it was identified thatangiogenic factors were upregulated in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that wereco-cultured with multiple myeloma cell lines. It was also revealed thatupregulated ILK expression significantly promoted the capillary-formation abilityof MSCs. The concentrations of angiogenic factors were significantly decreasedcompared with non-targeting siRNA-transfected and control MSCs. MSCs mayparticipate in inducing the angiogenic response in multiple myeloma depending on ILK expression.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8711 PMCID: PMC6019980PMID: 29963187
