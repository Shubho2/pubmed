The primary aim of the current study was to identify criticalproteins that may play roles in opposing the antisurvival effect of theproteasome inhibitor bortezomib together with the calcium-chelator BAPTA-AM incancer cells using label-free LC-MS/MS. In addition, based on the results of the proteomic technique, a novel and more effective inhibitor combination involvingbortezomib as well as OTSSP167 was developed for breast cancer cells.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using label-free LC-MS/MS, it was found that expressions of 1266 proteins were significantly changed between the experimental groups. Amongthese proteins were cell division cycle 5-like (Cdc5L) and drebrin-like (DBNL).We then hypothesized that inhibition of the activities of these two proteins may lead to more effective anticancer inhibitor combinations in the presence ofproteasomal inhibition. In fact, as presented in the current study, Cdc5Lphosphorylation inhibitor CVT-313 and DBNL phosphorylation inhibitor OTSSP167were highly cytotoxic in 4T1 breast cancer cells and their IC50 values were 20.1 and 43 nM, respectively. Under the same experimental conditions, the IC50 valueof BAPTA-AM was found 19.9 μM. Using WST 1 cytotoxicity assay, it was determined that 10 nM bortezomib + 10 nM CVT-313 was more effective than the control, thesingle treatments, or than 5 nM bortezomib + 5 nM CVT-313. Similarly, 10 nMbortezomib + 10 nM OTSSP167 was more cytotoxic than the control, themonotherapies, 5 nM bortezomib + 5 nM OTSSP167, or than 5 nM bortezomib + 10 nMOTSSP167, indicating that bortezomib + OTSSP167 was also more effective thanbortezomib + CVT-313 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the 3D spheroidmodel proved that bortezomib + OTSSP167 was more effective than the monotherapiesas well as bortezomib + CVT-313 and bortezomib + BAPTA-AM combinations. Finally, the effect of bortezomib + OTSSP167 combination was tested on MDA-MB-231 breastcancer cells, and it similarly determined that 20 nM bortezomib +40 nM OTSSP167combination completely blocked the formation of 3D spheroids.CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the results presented here indicate thatbortezomib + OTSSP167 is a novel and effective combination and may be testedfurther for cancer treatment in vivo and in clinical settings.DOI: 10.1007/s10565-018-9435-z PMID: 29948483
