Materials andMethods In this retrospective analysis, 805 206 women were evaluated throughscreening and diagnostic test results by extracting 1 year of routine data from33 English breast screening centers. Centers used double reading of digitalmammograms, with arbitration if there were discrepant interpretations.Information on reader decisions, with results of follow-up tests, were used toexplore the effect of the second reader. The statistical tests used were the testfor equality of proportions, the χ2 test for independence, and the t test.Results The first reader recalled 4.76% of women (38 295 of 805 206 women; 95%confidence interval [CI]: 4.71%, 4.80%). Two readers recalled 6.19% of women intotal (49 857 of 805 206 women; 95% CI: 6.14%, 6.24%), but arbitration ofdiscordant readings reduced the recall rate to 4.08% (32 863 of 805 206 women;95% CI: 4.04%, 4.12%; P < .001). A total of 7055 cancers were detected, of which 627 (8.89%; 95% CI: 8.22%, 9.55%; P < .001) were detected by the second readeronly. These additional cancers were more likely to be ductal carcinoma in situ(30.5% [183 of 600] vs 22.0% [1344 of 6114]; P < .001), and additional invasivecancers were smaller (mean size, 14.2 vs 16.7 mm; P < .001), had fewer involvednodes, and were likely to be lower grade. Conclusion Double reading witharbitration reduces recall and increases cancer detection compared with singlereading. Cancers detected only by the second reader were smaller, of lower grade,and had less nodal involvement. © RSNA, 2018.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018171010 PMID: 29634439  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
