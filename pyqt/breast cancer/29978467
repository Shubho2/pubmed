[Epub ahead of print]A phase II trial of the pan-HER inhibitor poziotinib, in patients withHER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had received at least two priorHER2-directed regimens: results of the NOV120101-203 trial.Park YH(1), Lee KH(2), Sohn JH(3), Lee KS(4), Jung KH(5), Kim JH(6), Lee KH(7),Ahn JS(1), Kim TY(2), Kim GM(3), Park IH(4), Kim SB(5), Kim SH(6), Han HS(7), Im YH(1), Ahn JH(5), Kim JY(8), Kang J(9), Im SA(2).Author information: (1)Division of Hematology-Oncology, Departments of Medicine, Samsung MedicalCenter, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, KR.(2)Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, CancerResearch Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, KR.(3)Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei Cancer Center, Seoul, KR.(4)Center for Breast Cancer, National Cancer Center Hospital, Goyang, KR.(5)Department of Oncology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College ofMedicine, Seoul, KR.(6)Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital,Seoul National University College of Medicine, Soengnam, KR.(7)Department of Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital,Cheongju, KR.(8)Clinical Development Division, National OncoVenture, Goyang, KR.(9)Clinical Research and Development, Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Seoul, KR.Although the introduction of human epidermal growth factor receptor(HER)2-directed therapy including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, andtrastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breastcancers (mBCs) favorably changed the natural history of this disease, most cases of HER2-positive mBC will eventually progress. Poziotinib is an oral pan-HERkinase inhibitor showing potent activity through irreversible inhibition of thesekinases. This open-label, multicenter phase II study was designed to evaluate theefficacy and safety of poziotinib monotherapy in patients with HER2-positive mBC who had progressed from more than two HER2-directed therapies. Patients received 12 mg poziotinib once daily on a 14-day on/7-day off schedule. Progression-freesurvival (PFS) as the primary endpoint, the objective response rate (ORR),overall survival (OS), and safety were evaluated. From April 2015 to February2016, 106 patients were enrolled in the trial from seven institutes in SouthKorea. They had a median age of 51 years (range 30-76) and had received a median of four prior therapies including two HER2-directed therapies for advanced ormetastatic cancers. The median follow-up duration was 12 months. The median PFSwas 4.04 months (95% confidence interval, CI, 2.94-4.40 months), and medianoverall survival has not been reached. The most common treatment-related adverse events were (total/grade ≥3) diarrhea (96.23%/14.15%), stomatitis(92.45%/12.26%), and rashes (63.21%/3.77%). Poziotinib showed meaningful activityin these heavily treated HER2-positive mBCs. Diarrhea and stomatitis were themajor toxicities. Biomarker studies analyzed are warranted to support furtherevaluation of this treatment in such cases. This article is protected bycopyright.
