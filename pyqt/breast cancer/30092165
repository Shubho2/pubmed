They are secreted by all cell types, including immune cells suchas natural killer (NK) cells. However, mammalian cells release low quantities of exosomes, and the purification of exosomes is difficult. Here, nanovesicles were developed by extrusion of NK cells through filters with progressively smallerpore sizes to obtain exosome mimetics (NK-EM). The anti-tumour effect of theNK-EM was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. The morphological features of the NK-EMwere revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle trackinganalysis (NTA) and Western blot. In vitro, the cytotoxicity of the NK-EM tocancer cells (glioblastoma, breast carcinoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer andhepatic carcinoma) was assessed using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and CCK-8assay. For in vivo study, a xenograft glioblastoma mouse model was established.The anti-tumour activity of NK-EM was confirmed in vivo by the significantdecreases of BLI, size and weight (all p < .001) of the tumour compared with the control group. Moreover, NK-EM cytotoxicity for glioblastoma cells that relatedwith decreased levels of the cell survival markers p-ERK and p-AKT, and increasedlevels of apoptosis protein markers cleaved-caspase 3, cytochrome-c andcleaved-PARP was confirmed. All those results suggest that NK-EM exert strongerkilling effects to cancer cells compared with the traditional NK-Exo, at the sametime, the tumour targeting ability of the NK-EM was obtained in vivo. Therefore, NK-EM might be a promising immunotherapeutic agent for treatment of cancer.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1489824 PMID: 30092165
