157. J Mol Endocrinol. 2018 Jul;61(1):T1-T10. doi: 10.1530/JME-17-0236.PAPP-A and cancer.Conover CA(1), Oxvig C(2).Author information: (1)From the Division of Endocrinology Mayo ClinicRochester, Minnesota, USAConover.Cheryl@mayo.edu.(2)Department of Molecular Biology and GeneticsAarhus University, Aarhus,Denmark.The zinc metalloproteinase, PAPP-A, enhances local insulin-like growth factor(IGF) action through cleavage of inhibitory IGF-binding proteins, therebyincreasing IGF available for IGF receptor-mediated cell proliferation, migration and survival. In many tumors, enhanced IGF receptor signaling is associated with tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. We will first discuss PAPP-A structure andfunction, and post-translational inhibitors of PAPP-A expression or proteolyticactivity. We will then review the evidence supporting an important role forPAPP-A in many cancers, including breast, ovarian and lung cancer, and Ewingsarcoma.Â© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/JME-17-0236 PMID: 29844094
