In this study we developed99mTc-HYNIC-(tricine/EDDA)-Lys-FROP peptide with the ability of specific binding to MCF-7 breast tumor.METHODS: The FROP-1 peptide was conjugated with the bifunctional chelatorhydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC) and labeled with 99mTc using tricine/EDDAco-ligand. The cellular specific binding of 99mTc-HYNIC-FROP was evaluated ondifferent cell lines as well as with blocking experiment on MCF-7 (human breastadenocarcinoma). The tumor targeting and imaging of this labeled peptide wereperformed on MCF-7 tumor bearing mice.RESULTS: Radiochemical purity for 99mTc-HYNIC-(tricine/EDDA)-FROP was 99% whichwas determined with ITLC method. This radiolabeled peptide showed high stability in normal saline and serum about 98% which was monitored with HPLC method. Insaturation binding experiments, the binding constant (Kd) to MCF-7 cells wasdetermined to be 158 nM. Biodistribution results revealed that the99mTc-HYNIC-FROP was mainly exerted from urinary route. The maximum tumor uptake was found after 30 min post injection (p.i.); however maximum tumor/muscle ratio was seen at 15 min p.i. The tumor uptake of this labeled peptide was specific andblocked by co-injection of excess FROP. According to the planar gamma imagingresult, tumor was clearly visible due to the tumor uptake of99mTc-HYNIC-(tricine/EDDA)-FROP in mouse after 15 min p.i.CONCLUSIONS: The 99mTc-HYNIC-(tricine/EDDA)-FROP is considered a promising probe with high specific binding to MCF-7 breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1186/s12929-018-0420-x PMCID: PMC5817723PMID: 29455647
