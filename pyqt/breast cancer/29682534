Tcell immunity is important component of human immunity system and immunityresponding to tumor and dysfunction or imbalance of T cell immunity will lead to serious outcomes for body. T cell immunity includes many different types ofcells, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, memory cell, and so on, and each of them hasspecial function on antitumor response or tumor immune escape which is revealedin lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and so on. But its correlation with gastric cancer is not clear. Our review was preformed toexplore the relationship between the progress and prognosis of gastric cancer(GC) and T cell immunity. According to recent researches, T cell immunity mayhave an important role in the progress and prognosis of GCs, but its function is affected by location, category, related molecule, and interaction between thecells, and some effects still are controversial. More researches are needed toclarify this correlation.DOI: 10.1155/2018/3201940 PMCID: PMC5848132PMID: 29682534
