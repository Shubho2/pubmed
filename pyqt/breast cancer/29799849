The accuracy of residual disease measurement andreporting is of critical importance in treatment planning and prognosis for thesepatients. Currently, gross pathological evaluation of the residual tumor bed isthe greatest determinant for accurate reporting of NACT response. Fluorescenceimaging (FI) is a new technology that is being evaluated for use in the detectionof tumors in different oncological conditions.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether indocyanine greenfluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) is able to detect residual breast tumor tissueafter NACT in breast surgical operative specimens.METHODS: Patients who underwent NACT for BC and were admitted for breast surgery were selected for participation in this study. Free ICG (0.25 mg/kg) was injectedintraoperatively. Tumor-to-background fluorescence ratio (TBFR) was calculated onex vivo samples from the surgical specimen.RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-two samples from nine breast surgical specimens were evaluated for their fluorescence intensity. Among them, 52 were malignant(30.2%) and 120 were benign (69.8%). The mean TBFR was 3.3 (SD 1.68) in malignantsamples and 1.9 (SD 0.97) in benign samples (p = 0.0002). With a TBFR cut-offvalue of 1.3, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, falsenegative rate, and false positive rate of ICG-FI to predict residual tumoraldisease in breast surgical samples post-NACT were 94.2%, 31.7%, 92.7%, 5.8%, and 68.3%, respectively. If we restricted our analysis to only patients who achieved pCR, the negative predictive value for ICG-FI was 100%.CONCLUSIONS: These first observations indicate that ex vivo ICG-FI is sensitivebut not sufficiently specific to discriminate between benign breast tissue andmalignant residual tissue. Nevertheless, its negative predictive value seemssufficiently accurate to exclude the presence of residual breast tumor tissue on the operative specimen of patients treated by NACT, representing a potential toolto assist pathologists in the assessment of breast surgical specimens.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197857 PMCID: PMC5969773PMID: 29799849
