Electronic address: huhai@mail.sysu.edu.cn.Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) have a poor prognosis mostly due toearly metastasis. To explore the early event of metastasis in ESCC, weestablished an in vitro selection model to mimic the interaction of tumor cellswith extracellular matrix, through which a sub-line of ESCC cells with highinvasive ability was generated. By comparing the gene expression profile of thehighly invasive sub-line to that of the parental cells, ADAM12-L was identifiedas a candidate gene promoting ESCC cell invasion. Immunohistochemistry revealedthat the ADAM12-L was overexpressed in human ESCC tissues, especially at cancerinvasive edge, and ADAM12-L overexpression tightly correlated with increasedmetastasis and poor outcome of ESCC patients. Indeed, ADAM12-L knockdown reduced the invasion and metastasis of ESCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore,we demonstrated that ADAM12-L participated in focal adhesion turnover andpromoted the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which in turn increasedADAM12-L transcription through FAK/JNK/c-Jun axis. Therefore, a loop initiatedfrom the cancer cell upon the engagement with extracellular matrix through FAKand c-Jun to enhance ADAM12-L expression is established, leading to the positive feedback of further FAK activation and prompting metastasis. Our study indicates that overexpression of ADAM12-L can serve as a precision marker to determine the activation of this loop. Targeting ADAM12-L to disrupt this positive feedbackloop represents a promising strategy to treat the metastasis of esophagealcancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
