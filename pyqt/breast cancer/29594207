Allcases of bilateral BC were excluded. All patients who experienced loco regionalrecurrence have been studied. Mapping patterns of regional recurrences was alsoperformed and compared with the ESTRO and RTOG Guidelines of volume definitionand delineation guidelines.Results: Among the 796 women included, 10.1% were triple-negative (TN) and 18.8% were HER2-positive and 24.6% of them had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT). Internal mammary chain (IMC), supraclavicular (Level IV), infraclavicular (LevelsIII and II) and axillary LN (Level I) were treated in 85.6%, 88.3%, 77.9% and14.9% of cases, respectively. With a median follow-up of 64 months (range:6-102), 5-year locoregional (RFS and OS were 90% (95% CI: 88.1-92.4) and 90.9%(95% CI: 88.9-93), respectively. Twenty-three patients (2.9%) presentedlocoregional recurrences. Most of them presented aggressive biological featureswith grade III tumors in 17 patients (74%) with high mitotic index in 16 cases(70%) and triple negative tumors in 12 (52%). Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) wasobserved in 11 cases (48%). In 14 cases the locoregional recurrences werediagnosed at the same time as the metastatic disease whereas 4 patients presenteddistant metastases secondarily. Local (Chest wall) recurrences occurred in 13cases (56%) with the coverage by the isodose of 47.5 Gy (isodose 95%). Fifteenregional recurrences (lymph nodes) were observed in 13 patients. Only 3 regional recurrences occurred within irradiated volumes and 12 regional recurrencesoccurred outside irradiated areas.Conclusion: In presented series, the local recurrences were related mostly to thetumor biological aggressivity and radio resistance. Small number was caused bygeographical miss. Further follow-up and careful registration of the recurrences is needed to improve their understanding.DOI: 10.1016/j.ctro.2017.03.004 PMCID: PMC5833921PMID: 29594207
