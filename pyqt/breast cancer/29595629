Many studies have investigatedthe association between citrus fruit intake and the risk of EC, but the resultsare inconsistent and not analyzed by category. We aimed to perform ameta-analysis of studies to evaluate the incidence between citrus fruitconsumption and subtypes of esophageal cancer and derive a more preciseestimation.Through searches of PubMed, OVID, and Web of Science we updated 1988systematic review up to April 2016. Based on an inclusion and exclusion criteria,conventional meta-analysis according to DerSimonian and Laird method was used forthe pooling of the results. Random-effect models were used to calculatesubgroups.Twenty-five English articles (20 case-control studies and 5 cohortstudies) comprising totally 5730 patients of esophageal cancer would be suitable for use in this study. The result indicated the inverse associations betweenintakes of citrus fruit and EC (relative risk [RR] = 0.65, 95% confidenceinterval [CI] 0.56-0.75, I  = 51.1%, P = .001), Esophageal squamous cellcarcinoma (ESCC) (RR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.76, I  = 60.7%, P = .002), nosignificant relationship between citrus fruit and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)(RR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-1.01, I  = 0.0%, P = .598).This meta-analysis indicatesthat intakes of citrus fruit significantly reduce the risk of ESCC and is noobvious relationship with EAC. Further studies about constituents in citrus fruitand its mechanism are warranted.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010018 PMCID: PMC5895383PMID: 29595629  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
