Positive marginsincrease the likelihood of tumor recurrence. Intra-operative fluorescencemolecular imaging (IFMI) aims to focus surgery on malignant tissue thussubstantially lowering the presence of positive margins as compared with standardtechniques of breast conservation (ST). A goal of this paper is to assess theincremental number of surgeries and costs of IFMI vs. ST.METHODS: We developed a decision analytical model and applied it for an earlyevaluation approach. Given uncertainty we considered that IFMI might reduce theproportion of positive margins found by ST from all to none and this proportionis assumed to be reduced to 10% for the base case. Inputs included data from the literature and a range of effect estimates. For the costs of IFMI, respectivecost components were added to those of ST.RESULTS: The base case reduction lowered number of surgeries (mean [95%confidence interval]) by 0.22 [0.15; 0.30] and changed costs (mean [95%confidence interval]) by €-663 [€-1,584; €50]. A tornado diagram identified theDiagnosis Related Group (DRG) costs, the proportion of positive margins of ST,the staff time saving factor and the duration of frozen section analysis (FSA) asimportant determinants of this cost.CONCLUSIONS: These early results indicate that IFMI may be more effective than STand through the reduction of positive margins it is possible to save follow-upsurgeries-indicating further health risk-and to save costs through this marginreduction and the avoidance of FSA.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198137 PMCID: PMC5983425PMID: 29856875
