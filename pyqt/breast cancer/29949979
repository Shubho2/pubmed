Given anannotated molecular network and reference tumor mutation profiles for whichsubtypes have been predefined, NBS2 is trained by adjusting the weights oninteraction features such that network propagation best recovers the providedsubtypes. After training, weights are fixed such that mutation profiles of newtumors can be accurately classified. We evaluate NBS2 on breast and glioblastoma tumors, demonstrating that it outperforms the best network-based approaches inclassifying tumors to known subtypes for these diseases. By interpreting theinteraction weights, we highlight characteristic molecular pathways drivingselected subtypes.Availability and implementation: The NBS2 package is freely available at:https://github.com/wzhang1984/NBSS.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformaticsonline.DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty247 PMCID: PMC6022559PMID: 29949979
