Breasttumor-bearing rats were randomly assigned to Control, Hydroxytyrosol, Paclitaxel and Paclitaxel plus hydroxytyrosol groups, for 6 weeks. Tumor volume, cellproliferation and several systemic oxidative stress parameters were measured.Anti-proliferative activity in vitro experiments was correlated with in vivoexperiments.RESULTS: Combination group did significantly reduce tumor volume when comparedwith paclitaxel alone. Additionally, the combination improved the antioxidantstatus without compromising the antitumor activity of standard chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: These findings reveal for the first time that hydroxytyrosol is anactive partner in combined therapies with paclitaxel against breast cancer.Combination with hydroxytyrosol would also ensure a less oxidative impact ofchemotherapeutic drugs that could potentially improve patient wellness.DOI: 10.1007/s00394-018-1638-9 PMID: 29468462
