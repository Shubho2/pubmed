The objective of this study is to compare the coexpressionnetwork modules of both cancers, so as to infer the potential cancer-relatedmodules.METHODS: We applied the eigen-decomposition to the matrix that integrates thegene coexpression networks of both breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Withhierarchical clustering of the related eigenvectors, we obtained the networkmodules of both cancers simultaneously. Enrichment analysis on Gene Ontology(GO), KEGG pathway, Disease Ontology (DO), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis(GSEA) in the identified modules was performed.RESULTS: We identified 43 modules that are enriched by at least one of the fourtypes of enrichments. 31, 25, and 18 modules are enriched by GO terms, KEGGpathways, and DO terms, respectively. The structure of 29 modules in both cancersis significantly different with p-values less than 0.05, of which 25 modules havelarger densities in ovarian cancer. One module was found to be significantlyenriched by the terms related to breast cancer from GO, KEGG and DO enrichment.One module was found to be significantly enriched by ovarian cancer relatedterms.CONCLUSION: Breast cancer and ovarian cancer share some common properties on the module level. Integration of both cancers helps identifying the potential cancer associated modules.DOI: 10.1186/s12918-018-0530-9 PMCID: PMC5907153PMID: 29671401
