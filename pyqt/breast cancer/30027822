Severalsingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with the risk ofbreast cancer development in women; however, little is known regarding theirinfluence on canine mammary tumor risk. We assessed the influence of SNPs ingenes related to human breast cancer susceptibility, with respect to the risk of development of mammary tumors in dogs. Sixty-seven canine SNPs inproto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, genes involved in DNA repair, and inhormonal metabolism were evaluated in 212 bitches with mammary tumors and in 161 bitches free of mammary neoplasia. A significant association with mammaryneoplasia risk was identified for 2 SNPs in RAD51 ( rs23623251 and rs23642734)and one SNP in the STK11 gene ( rs22928814). None of the other SNPs were related to the risk of mammary tumor development. The identification of genetic profiles associated with risk of mammary neoplasia is of great importance, supporting the implementation of specific clinical management strategies in high-risk animals.DOI: 10.1177/1040638718789231 PMID: 30027822
