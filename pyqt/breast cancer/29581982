This study investigated potential roles oftransforming growth factor- (TGF-) α in the interaction between breast cancer andBMSCs in BM. Clinical cases of breast cancer with bone metastasis (BMBC), breast cancer without bone metastasis (Non-BM-BC), and benign fibroadenoma (Benign) wereenlisted in a retrospective study. TGF-α was found obviously overexpressed in BM lesion of BMBC compared to primary lesion of both BMBC and Non-BM-BC (P < 0.01), and TGF-α was higher in primary lesion of both BMBC and Non-BM-BC (P < 0.01) thanBenign group. Interestingly, TGF-α in nontumor tissues of both BMBC and Non-BM-BCwas at a higher level than Benign group (P < 0.01), and numbers of macrophages innontumor tissues of both BMBC and Non-BM-BC (P < 0.01) were higher than Benigngroup. Furthermore, in cultured human BMSCs, TGF-α stimulated production ofprocancer cytokines including IL-6, VEGF, FGF10, FGF17, and TGF-β1 in adose-dependent manner. Thus, TGF-α in BC could potentially be an important signalof carcinogenesis and metastasis. Macrophages in the nontumor tissue of BC maynot be protective but could promote cancer metastasis.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6565393 PMCID: PMC5822790PMID: 29581982
