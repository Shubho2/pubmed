Morbidity and mortality have been shown to increase proportionally to the meanheart dose. Deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) can reduce heart dose compared tofree-breathing (FB) by increasing the heart-to-chest wall distance, especially inleft-sided breast cancer. We present our clinical experience with DIBH in leftbreast and chest-wall irradiation using 3D optical surface tracking.MATERIALS & METHODS: 29 patients were treated with DIBH using a surface tracking system that provides a real time 3D surface image of the patient. Comparisons of maximum and mean heart dose, heart-chest wall separation, and the percentage oflung volume that receives 20 or more Gy (V20) between the DIBH and hypotheticalFB treatment plans were conducted with the Student's t-test. Correlationcoefficients were also calculated for heart-chest wall separation, heart volume, and lung volume.RESULTS: Comparing DIBH and FB plans showed a decrease in mean and maximum heart doses in all patients. Individual mean heart doses decreased by an average of1.12 Gy, and the average mean heart dose for DIBH plans was significantly lowerthan corresponding FB plans (1.02 vs. 2.12 Gy; p < 0.0001). Maximum heart dosedecreased by an average of 11.88 Gy and was significantly lower in DIBH versus FBplans (28.33 vs. 43.7 Gy; p = 0.0001). The average difference in heart tochest-wall separation between DIBH and FB images was 2.41 cm. DIBH left lungvolume and measured increases in volume on inspiration inversely correlated with maximum heart dose (R = 0.39) and left lung V20 (R = 0.32).CONCLUSIONS: DIBH with 3D surface tracking can significantly benefit patientswith left sided disease by limiting the mean and maximum heart dose. DIBH appearsto viably reduce heart dose for left-breast cancer patients and thus potentially reduce long-term complications without prolonging treatment delivery.Copyright Â© 2018 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists.
