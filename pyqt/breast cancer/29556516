The relationships between imaging features,gene/protein expression, and response to therapy hold potential to guidepersonalized medicine. We aim to characterize the relationship betweenradiologist-annotated tumor phenotypic features (based on MRI) and the underlyingbiological processes (based on proteomic profiling) in the tumor.Methods: Multiple-response regression of the image-derived, radiologist-scoredfeatures with reverse-phase protein array expression levels generated associationcoefficients for each combination of image-feature and protein in the RPPAdataset. Significantly-associated proteins for features were analyzed withIngenuity Pathway Analysis software. Hierarchical clustering of the results ofthe pathway analysis determined which features were most strongly correlated withpathway activity and cellular functions.Results: Each of the twenty-nine imaging features was found to have a set ofsignificantly correlated molecules, associated biological functions, andpathways.Conclusions: We interrogated the pathway alterations represented by the proteinexpression associated with each imaging feature. Our study demonstrates therelationships between biological processes (via proteomic measurements) and MRIfeatures within breast tumors.DOI: 10.18632/oncoscience.397 PMCID: PMC5854291PMID: 29556516
