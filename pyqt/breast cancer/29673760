Electronic address: skandalis@upatras.gr.The malignant phenotype of various cancers is linked to enhanced expression ofhyaluronan, a pro-angiogenic glycosaminoglycan whose expression is suppressed by 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), a non-toxic oral agent used as a dietary supplementto improve health and combat prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of 4-MU in mammary carcinoma cells with distinct malignant phenotypes andestrogen receptor (ER) status, a major prognostic factor in the clinicalmanagement of breast cancers. We focused on two breast cancer cell lines, the lowmetastatic and ERα+ MCF-7 cells, and the highly-aggressive and ERα- MDA-MB-231cells. Treatment with 4-MU caused a dose-dependent decrease of hyaluronanaccumulation in the extracellular matrix as well as within the breast cancercells, most prevalent in cells lacking ERα. This decrease in hyaluronan wasaccompanied by suppression of Hyaluronan Synthase 2 (HAS2), the major enzymeresponsible for the synthesis of hyaluronan, and by induction of hyaluronidases(HYALs) -1 and -2. Moreover, 4-MU induced intense phenotypic changes andsubstantial loss of CD44, a major hyaluronan receptor, from cell protrusions.Importantly, 4-MU evoked differential effects depending on the absence orpresence of ERα. Only the ERα+ cells showed signs of apoptosis, as determined by cleaved PARP-1, and anoikis as shown by concurrent loss of E-cadherin andβ-catenin. Interestingly, 4-MU significantly reduced migration, adhesion andinvasion of ERα- breast cancer cells, and concurrently reduced the expression andactivity of several matrix degrading enzymes and pro-inflammatory molecules with tumor-promoting functions. Collectively, our findings suggest that 4-MU couldrepresent a novel therapeutic for specific breast cancer subtypes with regard to their ER status via suppression of hyaluronan synthesis and regulation of HAS2,CD44, matrix-degrading enzymes and inflammatory mediators.Copyright © 2017 International Society of Matrix Biology.
