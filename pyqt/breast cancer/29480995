Email: dusanee.s@ scholar.tsu.ac.thBackground: Chemotherapy treatment can increase survival rates among women withbreast cancer elsewhere. However, it also has negative impact on womenâ€™s general appearance, body image and psychological functioning. This study aimed todescribe the experiences of chemotherapy treatment among Thai women with breastcancer in rural communities, sounthern Thailand. Methods: Qualitative approachwas employed to gain insights about the experiences of the women. In-depthinterviewing and drawing methods were conducted with 20 Thai women who had beendiagnosed with breast cancer. Thematic method was used to analyse the data.Results: Three themes emerged from the findings: I feel so weak: Lack of physicalenergy; experiencing physical and emotional burdens and managing health and life.Women were traumatized by effects of chemotherapy and suffered severe physicalside effects. Most received inadequate professional support from health careproviders and had to rely on their own judgment and use local resources to dealwith the effects of their treatment and to improve their health and well-being.Conclusions: Chemotherapy brought about traumatic experiences to Thai women with breast cancer. Continual support is needed for the women to reduce thedifficulties they might encounter. Support groups should be established for thesewomen when receiving and completing chemotherapy treatment. Our finding suggestedthat social support programs that meet their need are salient means that couldreduce the sufferings of these women. Nurses and other health care professionals in the local community should play their important role to establish such groupand make it accessible for all.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.2.521 PMCID: PMC5980944PMID: 29480995
