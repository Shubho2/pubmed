Although the monoclonalantibody therapy is prescribed for CRC, the metastasis resistant to therapy isthe major cause of death of patients with CRC, which indicating the urgentdemands for new therapeutic targets discovery. Aquaporin 8 (AQP8) has beenidentified alter expressed in several cancers including breast cancer, lungcancer and prostatic carcinoma. Our study demonstrated the functionalsignificance of AQP8 in CRC cells growth and metastasis. Over-expression of AQP8 remarkably decreased growth, aggressiveness and colony formation in the CRC SW480and HT-29 cells. Mechanistically, AQP8 over-expression inhibited tumorigenicphenotype by inactivating PI3K/AKT signaling and inhibiting PCDH7 expression.Furthermore, in vivo studies using nude mice xenograft and metastasis modelidentified the pivotal role of AQP8 in CRC cells growth and metastasis. Takentogether, the present study verifies the vital role of the endogenous AQP8 incolorectal cancer progression.PMCID: PMC5835694PMID: 29511597
