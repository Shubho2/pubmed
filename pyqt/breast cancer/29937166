A risk model based on factors impacting nodal axillary was developed.RESULTS: The overall nodal conversion rate was 36.2% (42/116). Axillary nodalresponse was associated with three variables: menopausal status [Odds ratio(OR) = 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-0.60], the radiological % ofbreast tumour shrinkage ≥50% (OR = 3.71; 95% CI 1.51-9.10), and negative hormone receptors (ER-, PR-) (OR = 2.41; 95% CI 0.99-5.87). These variables were includedin the RSS and assigned scores ranging from 0 to 2. The discrimination of the RSSwas 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.86]. A total score of 3 pointscorresponded to the optimal threshold of the RSS. The diagnostic accuracy was74.1%.CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the probability of axillary nodal pCR afterNAC can be accurately predicted so that women at high probability may be sparedof axillary surgery.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
