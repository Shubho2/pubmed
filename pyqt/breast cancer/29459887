Ltd., Delhi, India.(2)Department of Biotechnology, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India.Recent years have seen cancer emerge as one of the leading cause of mortalityworldwide with breast cancer being the second most common cause of death amongwomen. Individuals harboring BRCA mutations are at a higher risk of developingbreast and/or ovarian cancers. This risk is much greater in the presence ofgermline mutations. BRCA1 and BRCA2 play crucial role in the DNA damage response and repair pathway, a function that is critical in preserving the integrity ofthe genome. Mutations that interfere with normal cellular function of BRCA notonly lead to onset and progression of cancer but also modulate therapy outcome oftreatment with platinum drugs. In this review, we discuss the structural andfunctional impact of some of the prevalent BRCA mutations in breast and ovariancancers and their role in platinum therapy response. Understanding the responseof platinum drugs in the context of BRCA mutations may contribute towarddeveloping better therapeutics that can improve survival and quality of life ofpatients.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00016 PMCID: PMC5807680PMID: 29459887
