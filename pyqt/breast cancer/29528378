Based on striking aggregation of breast cancer and BE/EAC within families as well as shared risk factors and molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis, wehypothesized that BE may be associated with breast cancer. Pedigree analysis offamilies identified prospectively at multiple academic centers as part of theFamilial Barrett's Esophagus Consortium (FBEC) was reviewed and families withaggregation of BE/EAC and breast cancer are reported. Additionally, using amatched case-control study design, we compared newly diagnosed BE cases inCaucasian females with breast cancer (cases) to Caucasian females without breast cancer (controls) who had undergone upper endoscopy (EGD). Two familialpedigrees, meeting a stringent inclusion criterion, manifested familialaggregation of BE/EAC and breast cancer in an autosomal dominant inheritancepattern with incomplete penetrance. From January 2008 to October 2016, 2812breast cancer patient charts were identified, of which 213 were Caucasian femaleswho underwent EGD. Six of 213 (2.82%) patients with breast cancer hadpathology-confirmed BE, compared to 1 of 241 (0.41%) controls (P-value < 0.05).Selected families with BE/EAC show segregation of breast cancer. A breast cancer diagnosis is marginally associated with BE. We postulate a common susceptibility between BE/EAC and breast cancer.DOI: 10.1093/dote/doy007 PMCID: PMC6005759 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29528378
