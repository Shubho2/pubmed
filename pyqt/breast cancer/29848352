However, the FOXP1expression patterns at different stages of breast cancer progression are largely unknown, and the significance of cytoplasmic FOXP1 (C-FOXP1) expression in breastcancer has not been well illustrated. The aims of this study were to investigate FOXP1 expression patterns in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), ductal carcinoma insitu (DCIS), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and usual ductal hyperplasia(UDH), and to analyze the clinicopathological relevance of C-FOXP1 and itsprognostic value in IDC.METHODS: N-FOXP1 and C-FOXP1 expression in cases of IDC, DCIS, ADH and UDH wasdetermined using immunohistochemistry. The correlation between C-FOXP1 expressionand clinicopathological parameters as well as the overall survival (OS) anddisease-free survival (DFS) rates of patients with IDC were analyzed.RESULTS: Exclusive N-FOXP1 expression was found in 85.0% (17/20), 40.0% (8/20),12.2% (5/41) and 10.8% (9/83) of UDH, ADH, DCIS, and IDC cases, respectively, andexclusive C-FOXP1 expression was observed in 0% (0/20), 0% (0/20), 4.9% (2/41),and 31.3% (26/83) of the cases, respectively. Both N- and C-FOXP1 staining wereobserved in 15.0% (3/20), 60.0% (12/20), 82.9% (34/41) and 48.2% (40/83) of theabove cases, respectively, while complete loss of FOXP1 expression was observedin only 9.6% (8/83) of IDC cases. Estrogen receptor (ER) expression inC-FOXP1-positive IDC cases (31/66, 47.0%) was significantly lower than that inC-FOXP1-negative cases (13/17, 76.5%) (p = 0.030). Calpain II expression wasobserved in 83.3% (55/66) of C-FOXP1-positive IDC cases, which was significantly higher than that in C-FOXP1-negative cases (9/17, 52.9%) (p = 0.007). Calpain II was significantly associated with pAKT (p = 0.029), pmTOR (p = 0.011), p4E-BP1(p < 0.001) and p-p70S6K (p = 0.003) expression levels. The 10-year OS and DFSrates of the C-FOXP1-positive patients were 60.5% and 48.7%, respectively, bothof which were lower than those of the C-FOXP1-negative patients (93.3, 75.3%).The OS curve showed a dramatic impact of C-FOXP1 status on OS (p = 0.045).CONCLUSIONS: Cytoplasmic relocalization of FOXP1 protein was a frequent event in breast IDC. Calpain II might play an important role in nucleocytoplasmictrafficking of FOXP1 and the AKT pathway might be involved in this process.C-FOXP1 expression was inversely associated with ER expression and might be apredictor of poor OS in patients with IDC.DOI: 10.1186/s13000-018-0715-y PMCID: PMC5977746PMID: 29848352
