No predictive biomarkers havebeen identified and no pharmacodynamics has properly been described so far.Patients and methods: Patients with early breast cancer were randomized 3:1 tooral palbociclib 125mg daily for 14 days until the day before the surgery vs. no treatment. Primary objective was antiproliferative response defined as a natural logarithm of Ki67 expression at day 15 below 1. Secondary end-points weresubgroups analyses and safety. Exploratory analyses included search forpredictive biomarkers. Immunostainings (Ki67, RB, pRB, p16, pAKT, pER, pCDK2,CyclinD1), FISH (CCND1) and gene expression arrays were performed at baseline andat surgery. In addition, activating PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations were assessed atbaseline.Results: 74 patients were allocated to palbociclib and 26 to control. Mostpatients (93%) were hormone-receptor (HR)-positive, whereas 8% wereHER2-positive. Palbociclib led to significantly more antiproliferative responses as compared to control (58% vs. 12%, p<0.001), and to a significantly higher Ki67decrease (p < 0.001). In the HR-positive/HER2-negative subgroup, thisantiproliferative effect was even more marked in the palbociclib arm as compared to control (70% vs. 9%, p<0.001). Palbociclib treatment led also to asignificantly higher decrease from baseline in phospho-Rb as compared to control (p<0.001). Among treated patients, changes in Ki67 correlated with changes inphospho-Rb (Spearman rank r = 0.41, p<0.0001). Gene expression analyses confirmeda major effect on proliferation and cell cycle genes. Among treated patients,CCNE2 expression was significantly more decreased in anti-proliferativeresponders vs. non-responders (p=0.006).Conclusion: Short-term pre-operative palbociclib decreases Ki67 in early breastcancer patients. Early decrease of Rb phosphorylation correlates with drug'seffect on cell proliferation and could potentially identify patients with primaryresistance.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy202 PMID: 29893769
