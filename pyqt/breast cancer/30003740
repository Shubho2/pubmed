The demographic characteristics, data regarding breast examspractices, screening motivators and barriers and sources of information on breastcancer were collected by self-administered questionnaire.RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 478 women in 2009 and 453 in 2016,with increase in women reporting regular mammograms or at least one previousmammogram (from 30.1% to 58.6%, p=0.000). In 2009, the most frequent motivatingfactors were health maintenance (36%), friend's advice, TV, cancer in the family or fear of breast cancer; in 2016, advice from gynecologist (significant increasefrom 10.9% to 37.7%, p=0.000), health maintenance, family cancer and fear ofcancer. The most frequent reasons for not going to exams regularly were absenceof breast problems, crowded doctor's offices and no family breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide information on motivation and barrier factorsthat may influence women's decision to participate in opportunistic breast cancerscreening. Those factors have changed over time and the role of physicians hasincreased significantly. Further exploration of motivating and barrier factorsand the extent of their association with actual women's behavior would be helpfulfor the development of interventions to improve organized and opportunisticscreening participation.PMID: 30003740
