The aim of this study was to examine theassociation between age, comorbidities and use of RT in this population. Methods:Patients diagnosed with breast cancer from 2004⁻2013 were identified from theAmerican College of Surgeons National Cancer Database (NCDB). Follow-up time was measured from the date of diagnosis (baseline) to the date of death or censoring.Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were used asthe measure of association. Results: Independently of comorbidities and otherimportant outcome-related factors, patients >65 years of age who received RTsurvived significantly longer than those who did not receive RT (aHR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.52⁻0.54). However, as women aged, those with comorbidities were lesslikely to receive RT (adjusted p-trend by age < 0.0001). Conclusions: Thedevelopment of decision-making tools to assist clinicians, and older women withbreast cancer and comorbidities, are needed to facilitate personalized treatment plans regarding RT. This is particularly relevant as the population ages and the number of women with breast cancer is expected to increase in the near future.DOI: 10.3390/medicines5030062 PMID: 29941817
