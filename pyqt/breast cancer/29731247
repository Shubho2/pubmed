Wehypothesized that race is a predictor of completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapyin patients with breast cancer.METHODS: All patients with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy2009-2016 at a single institution were stratified by completion of neoadjuvantchemotherapy and by race. Univariate analysis and multivariable logisticregression were used to identify patient and tumor characteristics that affected the rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy completion.RESULTS: A total of 92 (74%) of 124 patients completed their prescribedneoadjuvant chemotherapy. On univariate analysis, white patients were more likelyto complete neoadjuvant chemotherapy than non-white patients (76% vs 50%,P = .006). Non-white patients were more likely to have government insurance andlarger prechemotherapy tumors (both, P < .05), but these factors were notassociated with rates of neoadjuvant chemotherapy completion. After controllingfor age, insurance status, tumor size, and estrogen receptor status, whitesremained associated with completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OR 3.65,P = .014).CONCLUSION: At our institution, white patients with breast cancer were morelikely than non-white patients to complete neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Furtherinvestigation into the underlying factors impacting this disparity is needed.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.surg.2018.03.011 PMID: 29731247
