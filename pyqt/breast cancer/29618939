BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most common germline mutations found in both inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Once these mutations are identified andclassified, a course of action to reduce the risk of developing either ovarian orbreast cancer - including surveillance and surgery - is carried out.Purpose: The purpose of the current research is to characterize the geneexpression differences between healthy cells harboring a mutation in BRCA1/2genes and normal cells. This will allow detection of candidate genes and helpidentify women who carry functional BRCA1/2 mutations, which cannot always bedetected by the available sequencing methods, for example, carriers of mutations found in regulatory sequences of the genes.Materials and methods: Our cohort consisted of 50 healthy women, of whom 24 were individuals with BRCA1 or BRCA2 heterozygous mutations and 26 were non-carriercontrols. RNA purified from non-irradiated lymphocytes of nine BRCA1/2 mutationcarriers versus four control mutation-negative individuals was utilized forRNA-Seq analysis. The selected RNA-Seq transcripts were validated, and the levelsof spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) mRNA were measured by using real-timequantitative polymerase chain reaction.Results: Differences in gene expression were found when comparing untreatedlymphocytes of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and controls. Among others, the SYK genewas identified as being differently expressed for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. The expression level of SYK was significantly higher in untreated healthy lymphocytesof BRCA1 heterozygote carriers compared with controls, regardless of irradiation.In contrast to normal tissues, in cancerous breast tissues, the expression levelsof the BRCA1 and SYK genes were not intercorrelated.Conclusion: Collectively, our observations demonstrate that SYK may prove to be agood candidate for better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of BRCA1mutation-associated breast cancer.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S156359 PMCID: PMC5875411PMID: 29618939
