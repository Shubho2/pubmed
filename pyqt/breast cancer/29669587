Given the need to study the drivers of these trends, it isessential to validate methods to assess breast onset that can be used inlarge-scale studies when direct clinical assessment of breast onset is notfeasible.METHODS: Breast development is usually measured by Tanner stages (TSs), assessed either by physical examination or by mother's report using a picture-based SexualMaturation Scale (SMS). As an alternative, a mother-reported Pubertal DevelopmentScale (PDS) without pictures has been used in some studies. We compared agreementof SMS and PDS with each other (n = 1022) and the accuracy of PDS with clinicalTS as a gold standard for the subset of girls with this measure (n = 282) usingthe LEGACY cohort. We further compared prediction of breast onset using ROCcurves and tested whether adding urinary estrone 1-glucuronide (E1G) improved theAUC.RESULTS: The agreement of PDS with SMS was high (kappa = 0.80). The sensitivityof PDS vs clinical TS was 86.6%. The AUCs for PDS alone and SMS alone were 0.88and 0.79, respectively. Including E1G concentrations improved the AUC for bothmethods (0.91 and 0.86 for PDS and SMS, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The PDS without pictures is a highly accurate, sensitive, andspecific method for assessing breast onset, especially in settings where clinicalTS is not feasible. In addition, it is comparable to SMS methods with picturesand thus easier to implement in large-scale studies, particularly phone-basedinterviews where pictures may not be available. Urinary E1G can improve accuracy over than PDS or SMS alone.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0943-9 PMCID: PMC5907380PMID: 29669587
