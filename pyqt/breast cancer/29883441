Nanostructuring the electrode surface results in higher surface coverage ofcapture probes and more favorable orientation, as well as transport phenomenaunique to nanoscale, ultimately leading to enhanced sensor performance. Thecentral goal of this study is to investigate the influence of electrodenanostructure on electrically-guided immobilization of DNA probes for nucleicacid detection in a multiplexed format. To that end, we used nanoporous gold(np-Au) electrodes that reduced the limit of detection (LOD) for DNA targets bytwo orders of magnitude compared to their planar counterparts, where the LOD was further improved by an additional order of magnitude after reducing the electrodediameter. The reduced electrode diameter also made it possible to create a np-Au MEA encapsulated in a microfluidic channel. The electro-grafting reduced thenecessary incubation time to immobilize DNA probes into the porous electrodesdown to 10 min (25-fold reduction compared to passive immobilization) and allowedfor grafting a different DNA probe sequence onto each electrode in the array. Theresulting platform was successfully used for the multiplexed detection of threedifferent biomarker genes relevant to breast cancer diagnosis.DOI: 10.3390/nano8050351 PMCID: PMC5977365PMID: 29883441
