Molecular imaging of HER2 expression mayprovide essential prognostic and predictive information concerning disseminatedcancer and aid in selection of an optimal therapy. Radiolabeled low molecularweight peptide ligands are particularly attractive as probes for molecularimaging, since they reach and bind to the target and clear from non-target organsand blood stream faster than bulky antibodies. In this study, we evaluated apotential HER2-imaging probe, an A9 nonapeptide, derived from the trastuzumab-Fabportion. Its cellular uptake was investigated by mass spectrometry analysis ofthe cytoplasmic cellular extracts. Moreover, based on in-silico modeling, DTPAchelator was conjugated to N-terminus of A9. 111In-labeled A9 demonstratednanomolar affinity to HER2-expressing BT474 cells and favorable biodistributionprofile in NMRI mice. This study suggests that the peptide A9 represents a goodlead candidate for development of molecular probe, to be used for imagingpurposes and for the delivery of cytotoxic agents.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-21283-3 PMCID: PMC5812989PMID: 29445216
