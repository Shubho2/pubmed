Increased hyaluronan (HA) metabolism in the stroma of primary tumors promotes activation of oncogenic signaling pathways that impact tumor initiation,growth, and invasion. Carcinoma cell synthesis and assembly of HA-richpericellular matrices induces a stromal-independent phenotype, which isassociated with cancer progression. Although the pro-tumorigenic role of stromal HA is well established, a novel but unexplored hypothesis is that carcinomacell-associated HA pericellular matrices promote metastasis of circulating tumor cells. Here, we report the development of an in vitro assay that employsmicrofluidic techniques to directly measure the importance of an HA-richpericellular matrix in the entry of carcinoma cells into ectopic sites. Thismodel provides the capability to visualize specific steps in metastasis, which isdifficult using animal models. The results show that the presence of a HA-richpericellular matrix correlates to the invasive and metastatic potential of breastcarcinoma cells. Furthermore, enzymatic removal or pharmacologic inhibition of HAsynthesis significantly inhibits carcinoma cell extravasation and invasion inthis model system. These results implicate pericellular HA-rich carcinoma cellassociated pericellular matrices in colonization of ectopic sites by circulating tumor cells and support specific targeting of this matrix to limit metastasis in patients.DOI: 10.1039/c7ib00173h PMID: 29623978
