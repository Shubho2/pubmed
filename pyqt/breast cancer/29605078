Epub 2018Mar 16.Pre-surgical chemotherapy for breast cancer may be associated with improvedoutcomes.Cook M(1), Johnson N(2).Author information: (1)Legacy Cancer Institute, 1040 NW 22nd Ave, Portland, Oregon 97210, USA.Electronic address: madcook@lhs.org.(2)Legacy Cancer Institute, 1040 NW 22nd Ave, Portland, Oregon 97210, USA.BACKGROUND: Historical studies suggest no difference in disease outcome betweenneoadjuvant and adjuvant approaches in breast cancer. We hypothesize neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) may offer several benefits, possibly improving quality of lifeoutcomes.METHODS: Retrospective review of Tumor Registry data of breast cancer patientsfrom 2011 to 2015. Pathologists reviewed cases from 2012 to 2013 to provideadditional RCB (residual cancer burden) scores.RESULTS: From 2011 to 2015 there were 2707 breast cancer cases and 455 patientsreceived NCT. RCB score was documented in 348 with excellent outcome in 41% (pCR in 115 patients, 28 RCB I). There were 137 RCB II and 68 RCB III. Clinicallypositive nodes were present in 202 of 455 and 77 (38%) had clearance of nodaldisease. Of these 45 had axillary dissections.DISCUSSION: Neoadjuvant therapy was associated with excellent response rates.Thirty eight percent of patients with positive nodes converted to node negativealthough over 50% underwent axillary dissection. Higher utilization of NCT could decrease need for axillary dissection thereby lowering incidence of lymphedemaand improving quality of life for survivors.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
