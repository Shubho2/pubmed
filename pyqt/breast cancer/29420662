Aberrant activation of FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2)signaling through overexpression of FGFR2 and/or its ligands, mutations, orreceptor amplification has been reported in multiple cancer types, includinggastric, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, breast and lung cancer. In this paper,we describe application of the phage display technology to produce a panel ofhigh affinity single chain variable antibody fragments (scFvs) against theextracellular ligand-binding domain of FGFR2 (ECD_FGFR2). The binders wereselected from the human single chain variable fragment scFv phage displaylibraries Tomlinson I + J and showed high specificity and binding affinitytowards human FGFR2 with nanomolar KD values. To improve the affinity of the bestbinder selected, scFvF7, we reformatted it to a bivalent diabody format, or fusedit with the Fc region (scFvF7-Fc). The scFvF7-Fc antibody construct presented thehighest affinity for FGFR2, with a KD of 0.76 nM, and was selectivelyinternalized into cancer cells overexpressing FGFR2, Snu-16 and NCI-H716.Finally, we prepared a conjugate of scFvF7-Fc with the cytotoxic drugmonomethyl-auristatin E (MMAE) and evaluated its cytotoxicity. The conjugatedelivered MMAE selectively to FGFR2-positive tumor cells. These results indicate that scFvF7-Fc-vcMMAE is a highly potent molecule for the treatment of cancerswith FGFR2 overexpression.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0192194 PMCID: PMC5805272PMID: 29420662  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
