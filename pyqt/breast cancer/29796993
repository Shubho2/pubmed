It is approved for use in all indicationsfor which reference trastuzumab is approved, namely HER2-positive early breastcancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer. SB3 has similarphysicochemical and pharmacodynamic properties to those of reference trastuzumab,and the pharmacokinetic biosimilarity of the agents has been shown in healthyvolunteers and women with HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer. SB3 demonstrated clinical efficacy considered equivalent to that of referencetrastuzumab in women with HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer. The tolerability, immunogenicity and safety profiles of SB3 were similar to thoseof reference trastuzumab. The role of reference trastuzumab in the management of HER2-positive cancers is well established and SB3 provides an effectivebiosimilar alternative for patients requiring trastuzumab therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s40259-018-0282-5 PMID: 29796993
