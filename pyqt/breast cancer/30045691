There are thousands of published studiesidentifying various CIGs; however, no systematic collection or description isavailable.RESULTS: To construct a CIG reference for genetic screening, we have collected177 human genes curated from 1507 PubMed abstracts. To facilitate data queriesand browsing, the identified CIGs along with extensive bioinformatic annotations were stored in an online database called CIGene. Initial functional analysisrevealed an overlooked role for cell motility in cancer initiation. Subsequentcross-referencing of known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes against the 177CIGs identified 96 and 81 CIGs with and without known oncogenic roles,respectively. Successive network analyses of all 177 CIGs determined that the twogroups of genes were more likely to link within their group. The distinctmolecular functions for these groups were also confirmed with functional studies.While the 96 known oncogenic genes had fundamental roles in gene regulation andsignaling, the remaining 81 genes possessed more ancillary functions, suchenhancer binding. Further network and mutational analysis of the 96 knownoncogenic genes revealed that mutations in these genes were highly prevalent inmultiple cancers. By focusing on breast cancer, we found that 32 of the 96 genes with mutations in breast cancers were significantly associated with patientsurvival.CONCLUSIONS: As the first literature-based online resource for CIGs, CIGene will serve as a useful gateway for the systematic analysis of cancer initiation.CIGene is freely available to all academic users athttp://soft.bioinfo-minzhao.org/cigene/ .DOI: 10.1186/s12864-018-4944-y PMCID: PMC6060465PMID: 30045691
