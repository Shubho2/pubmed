Cancer patients and long-term survivors are known to be more sensitiveto health-related information and dietary changes could represent a potentialconsequence of this huge availability of messages. In our review about dietarychanges after cancer diagnosis, we found that this topic is particularlyinvestigated among the breast cancer population. The literature examined showthat breast cancer patients modify their eating habits after diagnosis in apercentage that varies between approximately 30% and 60%. The most reportedchanges were an increased consumption of fruit and vegetables, a decrease in the consumption of red meat, fats and sugary foods. Patients who reported changeswere more likely to be younger, with higher educational levels and with a longer period of time since their diagnosis of cancer. It also emerged that cancerpatients are often more likely to use supplements. This topic has not beeninvestigated in cancer patients in Italy, therefore, we propose an approach toexplore it with a structured questionnaire: The "ECHO SURVEY - Eating habitsCHanges in Oncologic patients".Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
