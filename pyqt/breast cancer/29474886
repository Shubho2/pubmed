Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is an efficientlocal tumour ablation modality that has proven clinical efficacy in the treatmentof various types of tumours metastasis to skin. Aims of this study are toevaluate the activity, toxicity, and feasibility of treating patients withelectrochemotherapy (ECT); their clinical outcomes and patient report outcomemeasures. This was a cohort study of 48 patients. In this study a good orexcellent response to treatment was observed in 74% of patients on the basis ofthe clinical photographs. Five patients had partial responses (14%) and threepatients had no response (8.5%). One patient died during the study period (2.8%).87% of patients said they would have ECT again if clinically indicated.Spearman's' rank correlation of clinical efficacy for anatomical location wasfound to be positive with poorer outcomes in head and neck compared to trunk and limbs. Complications were found in 16patients, of which all were either grade 1or 2 Clavien classification. The complications were predominantly in patientstreated with ECT for tumours the head and neck area. Initial assessment ofapplicable patient report outcome measures for our patient cohort demonstratethat there are no validated tools exist for ECT.
