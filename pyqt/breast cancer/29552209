Overexpression of the human epidermalgrowth factor 2 (HER-2) is associated with poor prognosis in the absence ofHER-2-targeted therapy, and with an increased incidence of CNS metastases inpatients with breast cancer. The role of HER-2 overexpression in CNS metastasesis not well known in gastric adenocarcinoma. The purpose of the presentretrospective study was to assess the incidence of CNS metastases and to evaluatethe associations between the CNS and HER-2 status in a series of consecutivepatients with gastric or GE junction cancer. Between 2007 and 2013, 300 patients with gastric cancer (GC) or gastroesophageal junction, were admitted to Piacenza General Hospital, Italy. These cases were retrospectively analyzed to evaluateCNS metastases. The metastases were diagnosed with imaging techniques performedon symptomatic patients. Gastric histological samples of patients with CNSmetastases were reviewed and tested for HER-2. A total of 7 of the 300 patients(2.33%) with GC were observed to have CNS metastases and 6 (85.71%) had HER-2positive disease. These patients exhibited a poor prognosis with a median overallsurvival rate of 4.1 months (range, 2.1-6.6 months). These results suggestedthere may be CNS recurrence susceptibility in patients with HER-2 positive GC. Tothe best of our knowledge, this is the first report that associates CNSmetastases and HER-2 status in gastric or GE junction cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8054 PMCID: PMC5840578PMID: 29552209
