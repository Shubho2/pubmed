Danzhi Xiaoyao powder (DXP) is a herbal formula that has an effect onbreast cancer, especially ER-positive breast cancer. However, the activecompounds, potential targets, and pharmacological and molecular mechanism of its action against cancer remain unclear.Methods: A network pharmacology approach comprising drug-likeness evaluation,oral bioavailability prediction, Caco-2 permeability prediction, multiplecompound target prediction, multiple known target collection, breast cancer genescollection, and network analysis has been used in this study.Results: Four networks are set up-namely, ER-positive breast cancer network,compound-compound target network of DXP, DXP-ER-positive breast cancer network,and compound-known target-ER-positive breast cancer network. Some ER-positivebreast cancer and DXP related targets, clusters, biological processes, andpathways, and several potential anticancer compounds are found.Conclusion: This network analysis successfully predicted, illuminated, andconfirmed the molecular synergy of DXP for ER-positive breast cancer, gotpotential anticancer active compounds, and found the potential ER-positive breastcancer associated targets, cluster, biological processes, and pathways. This workalso provides clues to the researcher who explores ethnopharmacological or/andherbal medicine's or even multidrugs' various synergies.DOI: 10.1155/2018/5059743 PMCID: PMC5859839PMID: 29692855
