The aim of our study was to investigate the presence of MMTV-like nucleotide sequences and viral protein in a larger number of feline (FMCs) and canine mammary carcinomas (CMCs) by nested PCR andimmunohistochemistry. Results showed that the presence of MMTV-like env sequence in FMCs was 7% (6/86), while all the CMCs and canine dysplastic lesions scorednegative. All PCR-positive FMCs scored positive for the MMTV p14 signal peptideof the envelope precursor protein of the virus. In contrast, all PCR-negativeFMCs and canine mammary lesions were also negative for immunohistochemistryanalysis. Canine and feline normal mammary gland tissues scored negative for bothPCR and MMTV-p14 protein. Multiple nucleotide alignment of MMTV-like env genesequences isolated from cat showed 97% and 99% similarity with HMTV and MMTV,respectively, while the others two presented some polimorphisms. Particularly thesequences of one of these two tumors showed a polymorphism (c.7575 A> G), thatcauses a previously unreported amino acid substitution (Thr > Ala). Inconclusion, the results of our study showed the presence of MMTV-like sequencesand viral protein in some FMCs. Further studies are needed to understand whether this virus does play a role in the development of FMCs, if MMTV-like is anexogenous virus as these data suggest and, in such a case, how and from whom thisvirus was acquired.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200839 PMCID: PMC6057629PMID: 30040851
