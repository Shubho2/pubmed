The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a fibrin sealant patch is able to reduce POPF in patientsundergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with pancreatojejunostomy.METHODS: In this multicentre trial, patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomywere randomized to receive either a fibrin patch (patch group) or no patch(control group), and stratified by gland texture, pancreatic duct size andneoadjuvant treatment. The primary endpoint was POPF. Secondary endpointsincluded complications, drain-related factors and duration of hospital stay. Riskfactors for POPF were identified by logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were enrolled. Forty-five of 71 patients (63 percent) in the patch group and 40 of 71 (56 per cent) in the control groupdeveloped biochemical leakage or POPF (P = 0·392). Fistulas were classified asgrade B or C in 16 (23 per cent) and ten (14 per cent) patients respectively(P = 0·277). There were no differences in postoperative complications (54patients in patch group and 50 in control group; P = 0·839), drain amylaseconcentration (P = 0·494), time until drain removal (mean(s.d.) 11·6(1·0) versus 13·3(1·3) days; P = 0·613), fistula closure (17·6(2·2) versus 16·5(2·1) days;P = 0·740) and duration of hospital stay (22·1(2·2) versus 18·2(0·9) days;P = 0·810) between the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysisconfirmed that obesity (odds ratio (OR) 5·28, 95 per cent c.i. 1·20 to 23·18;P = 0·027), soft gland texture (OR 9·86, 3·41 to 28·54; P < 0·001) and a smallduct (OR 5·50, 1·84 to 16·44; P = 0·002) were significant risk factors for POPF. A patch did not reduce the incidence of POPF in patients at higher risk.CONCLUSION: The use of a fibrin sealant patch did not reduce the occurrence ofPOPF and complications after pancreatoduodenectomy with pancreatojejunostomy.Registration number: 2013-000639-29 (EudraCT register).© 2018 The Authors.
