Both male and female patients wereincluded. Descriptive analysis was performed.RESULTS: A total of 161 patients met the inclusion criteria. Most (59.6%) werefemale patients, and the mean age at the time of EMPD diagnosis was 70.8±10.1years. Most (82%) of the 161 patients had at least 1 cancer screening testperformed, though screening practices varied widely. Of those screened for anunderlying malignancy, 17 distant, noncontiguous malignancies were identified in 15 patients (11.4%), with prostate (n=5), urinary tract (n=5), and breast (n=2)malignancies found most frequently. Most malignancies were identified by urinecytology, mammography, and prostate-specific antigen blood test. Of all patients,37 (23.0%) had an underlying contiguous malignancy identified by pathology.CONCLUSION: All patients diagnosed with EMPD should undergo cancer screening. At minimum, evaluation should include age-appropriate screening and the addition of urine cytology, mammography, and prostate-specific antigen blood test-if notalready performed-may be of particular use. An algorithm for evaluation ofpatients with newly diagnosed EMPD is proposed.Copyright © 2018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. Published byElsevier Inc.
