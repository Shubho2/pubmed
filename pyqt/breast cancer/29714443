Materials and methods: The study includes 408 BCpatients and 412 age-matched controls recruited from Near East Hospital and Dr.Burhan Nalbantoglu State Hospital in North Cyprus. Information regarding clinicaland epidemiological characteristics was collected through a standardizedinterview. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) werecalculated by logistic regression before and after adjusting for the potentialconfounders. Results: In addition to various recognized BC risk factors, strongassociations with BC were reported from women with fertility drugs used for >6cycles (OR = 3.305, 95% CI 1.850–5.906, P < 0.001), depression (OR = 2.10, 95% CI1.33–3.30, P < 0.001), exposure to radiation (OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.02–2.98, P =0.041), and excess consumption of oil (OR = 2.703, 95% CI 1.62–4.48, P < 0.001)and sugar (OR = 3.42, 95% CI 1.39–8.40, P = 0.007). Parental consanguinity (OR = 0.16, 96% CI 0.09–0.30, P < 0.001) and daily water intake of 1–2 L (OR = 0.36,95% CI 0.19–0.66, P < 0.001) were strong protective factors. Conclusion: Ourresults demonstrate the presence of classical as well as several additional BCrisks. The findings will be of great benefit in establishing adequateevidence-based awareness and preventative measures in the North Cypruspopulation.DOI: 10.3906/sag-1709-54 PMID: 29714443
