Thecompounds were characterized via their physical properties and FT-IR, 119SnMössbauer, and ¹H NMR spectroscopic data. The molecular structures were confirmedby single-crystal X-Ray diffraction crystallography. The geometry around thetin(IV) ion is trigonal bi-pyramidal. Variations in O⁻Sn⁻O···Sn' torsion angleslead to zig-zag and helical supramolecular assemblies for 1 and 2, respectively. The in vitro cell viability against human breast adenocarcinoma cancer celllines: MCF-7 positive to estrogens receptors (ERs) and MDA-MB-231 negative to ERsupon their incubation with 1 and 2 was investigated. Their toxicity has beenstudied against normal human fetal lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5). Compounds 1 and2 exhibit 134 and 223-fold respectively stronger antiproliferative activityagainst MDA-MB-231 than cisplatin. The type of the cell death caused by 1 or 2was also determined using flow cytometry assay. The binding affinity of 1 and 2towards the CT-DNA was suspected from the differentiation of the viscosity which occurred in the solution containing increasing amounts of 1 and 2. Changes influorescent emission light of Ethidium bromide (EB) in the presence of DNAconfirmed the intercalation mode of interactions into DNA of both complexes 1 and2 which have been ascertained from viscosity measurements. The correspondingapparent binding constants (Kapp) of 1 and 2 towards CT-DNA calculated throughfluorescence spectra are 4.9 × 10⁴ (1) and 7.3 × 10⁴ (2) M-1 respectively.Finally, the type of DNA binding interactions with 1 and 2 was confirmed bydocking studies.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19072055 PMID: 30011935
