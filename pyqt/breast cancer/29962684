The Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems) was used for dose calculations. For the FIF technique, subfields were added to the main fields to reduce hot and coldregions; for the ISC technique, the fluence editor application was used to extendthe optimal fluence. Planning target volume dose, dose homogeneity index (DHI),maximum dose, ipsilateral lung, and heart doses for the left breast irradiationand monitor unit (MU) counts required for treatment were compared between the twotechniques.Results: Compared with the FIF technique, the ISC technique significantlydecreased DHI values and volumes receiving >105% of the prescription dose, andincreased volumes receiving >95% of the dose and MU count (P < 0.01 for allcomparisons). For the heart and ipsilateral lung, the FIF technique significantlyreduced volumes receiving >5 Gy compared with the ISC technique (P < 0.01);however, volumes receiving >10, 20, and 30 Gy and the values of a mean dose didnot differ significantly between the techniques (P > 0.05).Conclusions: The ISC technique is preferred over the FIF technique.DOI: 10.4103/jmp.JMP_73_17 PMCID: PMC6020626PMID: 29962684
