Standard treatment, including axillary staging, is often not given tothese patients. This study aimed to investigate reasons to omit any surgicalaxillary staging or to refrain from completion axillary lymph node dissection(cALND) after positive-sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); so-called "incompletestaging". Furthermore, the impact of incomplete staging on regional control andsurvival in patients aged 75 or older was evaluated.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted including all primary breast cancer patients aged 75 or older, diagnosed between 2001 and 2008, and documentedby the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). Patients with incomplete staging werecompared to patients with complete axillary staging. Survival analyses were used to determine the risk of local, regional and distant recurrence and overallsurvival.RESULTS: In total, 1467 of 2116 (69%) patients were considered eligible, of whom 258 (17.2%) had incomplete axillary staging. For 93 patients, diagnosed in 6 ofthe 10 hospitals in the NCR-area, examination of clinical records revealed thatage, comorbidities and patient preferences were the main reason for omittingcomplete axillary staging. The 10-year axillary recurrence rate in these 93patients was 5.2% (95% CI, 0.03-10.1). Of the 77 patients who had died, 64 (83%) died of non-breast-cancer-related causes. No significant difference in overallsurvival was observed between patients with or without complete axillary staging.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the omission of complete axillarystaging is common in selected elderly breast cancer patients with ≥2comorbidities, with no apparent impact on regional control and 10-year overallsurvival.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
