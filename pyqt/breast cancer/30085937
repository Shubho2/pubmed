Weenrolled 136 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Theexpression of PD-L1 in tumor cells and that of PD-1 on paratumor-infiltratingimmune cells was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the data were analyzedusing SPSS software. The positive expression rates of PD-L1 and PD-1 intriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) were 47.8 and 43.5%, which were higher than those of other subtypes (P<0.05). The expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells wascorrelated with the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, andKi-67 (P<0.05). The expression of PD-1 in the tumor-infiltrating immune cells wascorrelated with the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, andKi-67 and the histological grade (P<0.05). The expression of PD-L1 in tumor cellswas correlated with the expression of PD-1 in paratumor-infiltrating immune cells(P<0.001). The expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells was found to be an independent prognostic risk factor with the progression-free survival rate for breastinvasive ductal carcinoma (P=0.003). These results indicate that PD-L1 and PD-1were highly expressed in TNBC which suggests that patients with TNBC may benefit from targeted immune therapies to a greater degree than patients with othersubtypes. PD-L1 expression is an independent risk factor for breast invasiveductal carcinoma and expression of PD-L1 is expected to be a prognostic factorfor breast cancer.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms ofthe Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0(CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
