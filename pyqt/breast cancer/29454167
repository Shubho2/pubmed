Electronic address: hjcho@kangwon.ac.kr.Polydopamine (PD)-coated nanocomposites (NCs) based on the ethanol extract ofAngelica gigas Nakai (AGN EtOH ext) were fabricated and evaluated for breastcancer therapy. AGN NCs were prepared using a modified emulsification-solventevaporation method and were further incubated in dopamine solution (at pH 8.6) tobe covered with the PD layer. PD-AGN NCs with a 213-nm mean diameter, narrow sizedistribution, and negative zeta potential values were fabricated in this study.Less negative (close to zero) zeta potential value of PD-AGN NCs than that of AGNNCs implied the existence of the PD layer in the outer surface of NCs. The PDlayer in PD-AGN NCs was also identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)and ultraviolet (UV)/visible absorption analyses. The sustained release ofdecursin (D) and decursinol angelate (DA), as major active pharmacologicalcomponents of AGN, was observed in both AGN NCs and PD-AGN NCs. Enhanced cellularbinding property of PD-AGN NCs, compared to AGN NCs, in MDA-MB-231 (human breast adenocarcinoma; triple-negative breast cancer) cells was observed. Improvedanticancer activities of PD-AGN NCs compared with those of AGN EtOH ext and AGNNCs were also shown in MDA-MB-231 cells. The developed PD-AGN NCs may be used as remarkable platform nanocarriers for efficient breast cancer therapy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
