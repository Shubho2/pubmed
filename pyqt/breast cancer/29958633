Electronic address: abishayee@ULarkin.org.Despite the advancement in the well-equipped and sophisticated laboratories andfacilities, cancer remains to be a major cause of death worldwide. Consequently, further investigation of novel strategies need to be evolved. Since the last few decades, the utilization of phytochemicals is emerging against several humancancers, including lung, breast, colon carcinoma, lymphoma, and otherhematological malignancies. Terpenoids are a category of therapeutically activephytochemicals that have been utilized against cancer, cardiovascular andneurodegenerative disorders. Particularly, celastrol, a pentacyclic terpenoid, iswell-studied for its variety of pharmacological properties. It is well documentedthat celastrol can modulate a variety of signaling pathways. Celastrol'santi-proliferative role has been found to be associated with its pro-apoptotic(via protein kinase B), anti-angiogenic (via vascular endothelial growth factorand vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), anti-metastatic (via matrixmetalloproteinases), and anti-inflammatory (via cytokines and chemokines)activities. This review describes various molecular mechanisms of celastrol forunderstanding the biology of cancer initiation, progression as well as designing efficacious therapeutic strategies.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
