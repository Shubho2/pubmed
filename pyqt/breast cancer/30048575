In June 2016, the National Comprehensive Cancer Networkchanged its guidelines from routine testing to omission of ordering completeblood cell count (CBC) and liver function tests (LFT) in patients with earlybreast cancer. In response, we developed an implementation strategy todiscontinue our historical practice of routine ordering of these tests inasymptomatic patients.METHODS: The ordering of CBC and LFT for clinical stage I-IIIA breast cancerpatients was audited in 2016. In June 2016, we utilized the levers of theNational Quality Strategy implementation methodology to enact a system-widechange to omit routine ordering. To measure the plan's effectiveness, guidelinecompliance for ordering was tracked continually.RESULTS: Of 92 patients with early stage cancer in 2016, the overall rate ofcompliance with guidelines for ordering a CBC and LFT was 82% (88/107) and 87%(93/107), respectively. Segregated by the pre- and post-guideline change timeperiod, the compliance rates for ordering a CBC and LFT were 78% and 87% (P =0.076).CONCLUSION: In contrast to historical reports of delays in adoption of newevidence-based guideline changes, we were able to quickly change providerpractice during the transition from routine ordering to omission of orderingscreening blood tests in newly diagnosed patients with early breast cancer.CopyrightÂ© Wisconsin Medical Society.PMID: 30048575
