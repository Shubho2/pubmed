TheAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons Oncoplastic Surgery Committee (ASBrS-OSC)conducted a survey to assess the scope of practice and level of interest inoncoplastic surgery among its members. Furthermore, the group sought to identify barriers to incorporating oncoplastic skills in a surgeon's practice.METHODS: A 10-question survey was administered in March 2017 to the entire ASBrS membership using an online format. Three solicitations were sent. Uniqueidentifiers allowed a single response.RESULTS: Of the 2655 surveys sent out, 708 members responded. Nearly all (99%)respondents had at least some interest in oncoplastic surgery. The current rates of performing nipple-sparing mastectomy, adjacent tissue transfer, and breastreduction with lumpectomy were 80, 60, and 51%, respectively. A minority ofrespondents reported independently performing breast reductions/mammaplasties(19%) or contralateral symmetrization (10%). Barriers to learning oncoplasticsurgery included surgeon's time and access to oncoplastic educationalmaterial/courses. Most respondents felt that training courses and videos mayallow them to better incorporate oncoplastic techniques in their practices.CONCLUSIONS: The interest in oncoplastic surgery among U.S. surgeons issignificant, yet there are barriers to incorporate these surgical techniques intoa breast surgeon's practice. As professional organizations provide access toeffective training and enduring educational resources, breast surgeons will beenabled to develop their oncoplastic skill set and safely offer these techniques to their patients.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6586-3 PMID: 30003450
