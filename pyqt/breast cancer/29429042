In thisstudy, the anti-proliferative activity of a novel  [Cu(L)(phen)] complex wasinvestigated on MCF-7 breast cancer cells using MTT assay. Since chemotherapy is lake of ability to distinguish between normal cells from cancerous cells,therefore we also investigated the effect of  [Cu(L)(phen)] complex on normalL929 cells. The results showed that following 24 and 48 h exposure of cells with  [Cu(L)(phen)] complex, the IC50 values for MCF-7 were significantly lower thanthat recorded for L929 and normal cells were less sensitive than cancerous cells to the complex. Additionally, the  [Cu(L)(phen)] complex displayed a time- andconcentration-dependent cytotoxic response, with MCF-7 and L929 cells. Also flow cytometry findings suggest that  [Cu(L)(phen)] complex is capable of decreasingcancer cell viability through apoptosis and did not efficiently activate thenecrosis process.DOI: 10.1007/s10534-018-0079-5 PMID: 29429042
