Electronic address: eremino@hacettepe.edu.tr.Cyclodextrins (CD) are natural macrocyclic oligosaccharides linked by α(1,4)glycosidic bonds. Hydrophobic cavity of CDs are able to incorporate smallmolecules, ions, macromolecules which makes them excellent delegates for forming nanoparticulate carriers upon chemical modification to render amphiphilicity toCDs. In this study, blank 6OCaproβCD nanoparticle was prepared and administeredto MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The effects of these nanoparticles on the cellswere investigated in depth through biochemical and proteomic tests following 48 hof incubation. Proteomics studies revealed that apoptosis-related protein levels of hnRNP and CBX1 were increased while HDGF was not affected supporting the idea that 6OCaproβCD nanoparticles prevent cell proliferation. Gene expression studieswere generally in correlation with protein levels since gene expression wassignificantly stimulated while protein levels were lower compared to the control group suggesting that a post-transcriptional modification must have occurred.Furthermore, 6OCaproβCD was observed to not trigger multidrug resistance asproved with RT-PCR that effectuates another exquisite characteristic of6OCaproβCD nanoparticle as carrier of chemotherapeutic drugs. Metabolomicpathways of CD effect on MCF7 cells were elucidated with HMDB as serinebiosynthesis, transmembrane transport of small molecules, metabolism of steroidhormones, estrogen biosynthesis and phospholipid biosynthesis. In conclusion,6OCaproβCD is a promising nanoparticulate carrier for chemotherapeutic drugs withintrinsic apoptotic effect to be employed in treatment of breast cancer andfurther studies should be conducted in order to comprehend the exact mechanism ofaction.Copyright © 2018.
