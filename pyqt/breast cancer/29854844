Targeting it with functional molecule, nanobubble can adhere selectively to cellular epitopes andreceptors outside the vasculature via enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)effect of tumor blood vessel. To enhance the targeting rate of our previousprepared NBs-Affibody for HER2 (+) breast cancer imaging, we introduced anear-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye, IR783, in this study to enhancetumor-specific targeting rate and provide a promising modality for dual-modeimaging. The prepared IR783-NBs-Affibody presented a uniform nanoscale sizearound 482.7 ± 54.3 nm, good biosecurity, and stability over time. Theencapsulation efficiency (EE) of IR-783 was 15.09% in the conjugates leading to asuccessful NIR fluorescence and ultrasound enhancement imaging ex vivo.IR783-NBs-Affibody was able to automatically accumulate on BT474 cells with ahighly increased targeting rate of 85.4% compared with previous NBs-Affibody of26.6%, while Affibody-guided HER2 binding was only found in HER2-positive celllines (BT474 and T-47D). The newly developed IR783-NBs-Affibody is characterized with favorable HER2 targeting ability and bimodal imaging capability for breastcancer. Thus, IR783-NBs-Affibody holds great potential in molecular diagnosis forpatients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6202876 PMCID: PMC5944285PMID: 29854844
