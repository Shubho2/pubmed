China.The tumor suppressor characteristics of cyclinâ€‘dependent kinase 10 (CDK10) innasopharyngeal carcinoma and breast cancer have been previously demonstrated. In the present study the expression status of CDK10 and its prognostic significance in gastric cancer was determined, as well as its role in cell proliferation andinvasion. Immunoblot analysis revealed that CDK10 protein expression was notably decreased in gastric cancer compared with normal tissues. Immunohistochemistrydemonstrated that the loss of CDK10 expression, which was observed in 50.8% ofprimary gastric cancer tissues (n=128), significantly correlated with advancedtumor stage (P<0.001), frequent lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), distantmetastasis (P=0.013), tumor differentiation (P=0.004) and unfavorable overallsurvival (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis suggested that CDK10 expression mayserve as an independent prognostic predictor (P=0.001) for the progression ofgastric cancer. In addition, ectopic CDK10 expression inhibited gastric cancercell proliferation, migration and invasion, while knockdown of CDK10 promotedthese phenotypes. Collectively, the results of the present study indicated thatCDK10 expression may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker that holds therapeuticpromise for gastric cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.8662 PMID: 29512714
