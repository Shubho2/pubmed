Volume was calculated using the 10-cm interval circumferencemeasurement method (reference test) and percentage difference between arms, forvolume and circumference, was determined. First, the most valid singlemeasurement location was determined by calculating Pearson's correlationcoefficient relative to the reference test. Second, to evaluate theresponsiveness to change over four time points, outcomes of the selected singlemeasurement and the reference test were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA.Third, area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the optimal sensitivityand specificity of the selected single measurement site (index test).Relationship between lymphedema (yes/no) and heaviness and swelling (yes/no) was analyzed using phi-coefficient.RESULTS: The measurement point 30 cm proximal to the styloid process showed thehighest correlation with percentage difference in total arm volume (r = 0.80) anddetected increased percentage difference between arms after treatment. Analysesshowed high accuracy (AUC = 0.94; 95% CI 0.90-0.99) and good sensitivity (0.85)and specificity (0.85) using a cutoff score of 4% circumference differencebetween arms at this location. A moderate correlation between feelings ofheaviness and swelling to lymphedema was observed (rφ = 0.64).CONCLUSIONS: Circumference difference between arms of 4% measured at 30 cmproximal to the styloid process can be used as a surveillance site for furthermonitoring of patients at risk for lymphedema and may contribute to earlydiagnosis. Feelings of heaviness or swelling have moderate relationship withlymphedema, which needs to be confirmed in clinical practice.DOI: 10.1080/09593985.2018.1474404 PMID: 29757069
