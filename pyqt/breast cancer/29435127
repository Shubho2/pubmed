E) is considered an essential dietary nutrient for humans andanimals. An enormous body of evidence indicates the biological and protectiveeffects of Vit. E consumption. Tocopherol-associated protein (TAP) is a majortocopherol-binding protein affecting Vit. E stimulation and downstream signaling transduction. However, how Vit. E utilizes TAP as an anti-cancer mechanismremains unclear. Microarray analysis of signature gene profiles in breast cancer cells treated with α-tocopheryl succinate (α-TOS, a Vit. E isoform) resulted incell cycle arrest and anti-cancer activity in breast cancer cells. Pterostilbene (PS), a natural dietary antioxidant found in blueberries, in combination withα-TOS synergistically maximized breast cancer cell growth inhibition bydisrupting signal transduction, transcription factors and cell cycle proteins. Ina xenograft mouse model, PS treatment with Vit. E inhibited breast tumor growthand cell invasion, which were evaluated using our recently developed circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection assay. Because dietary Vit. E and PS supplementationcontributed to preventative and therapeutic effects in vitro and in vivo, thiscombination may benefit breast cancer therapy in the clinic.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23390 PMCID: PMC5796998PMID: 29435127
