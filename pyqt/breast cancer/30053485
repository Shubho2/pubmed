Othermeasurements obtained concomitantly for the assessment of psychometric propertiesincluded the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire, a visual analog scale, the WorldHealth Organization grading scale for mucositis, and the National CancerInstitute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity scale. Fortest-retest analysis, patients and guardians responded to the self-report andproxy versions of ChIMES within intervals of 1 to 7 days.RESULTS: Regarding internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha values were α=0.769(confidence interval (CI): 0.631-0.868) and α=0.879 (CI: 0.872-0.920) for theself-reported and proxy versions, respectively. The convergent validity criteria were met for the self-reported and proxy versions (Spearman's Rho: 0.466-0.751,p<0.001 and Spearman's Rho: 0.410-0.551, p<0.001, respectively). Test-retestreliability assessment for the total score and items 1, 2, 3 and 4 in bothversions showed an ICC≥0.7.CONCLUSIONS: The Portuguese self-reported and proxy versions of ChIMES wereconsidered to be culturally adapted, valid and reliable for Brazilian pediatricpatients ranging from one month old to 18 years old and were named ChIMES-BR.Copyright © 2018.
