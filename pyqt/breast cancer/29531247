However, the effectiveness of thistherapy is limited by innate or acquired resistance in approximately one-third ofpatients. Activating mutations in the ESR1 gene that encodes ERα promote criticalresistance mechanisms. Here, we developed a high sensitivity approach based onenhanced-ice-COLD-PCR for detecting ESR1 mutations. The method produced anenrichment up to 100-fold and allowed the unambiguous detection of ESR1 mutationseven when they consisted of only 0.01% of the total ESR1 allelic fraction. After COLD-PCR enrichment, methods based on next-generation sequencing ordroplet-digital PCR were employed to detect and quantify ESR1 mutations. Weapplied the method to detect ESR1 mutations in circulating free DNA from theplasma of 56 patients with metastatic ER-positive BC. Fifteen of these patientswere found to have ESR1 mutations at codons 536-538. This study demonstrates the utility of the enhanced-ice-COLD-PCR approach for simplifying and improving thedetection of ESR1 tumor mutations in liquid biopsies. Because of its highsensitivity, the approach may potentially be applicable to patients withnon-metastatic disease.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22312-x PMCID: PMC5847549PMID: 29531247
