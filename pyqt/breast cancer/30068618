Itcomprehensively evaluates the effects of pharmacogenetic variants, use ofconcomitant medications and biomarkers involved in oestrogen metabolism on breastcancer recurrence risk.PARTICIPANTS: The ProBe CaRe study was established using resources from theDanish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG), including 5959 premenopausal women diagnosedwith stage I-III primary breast cancer between 2002 and 2010 in Denmark. Eligibleparticipants were divided into two groups based on oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα)expression and receipt of TAM therapy, 4600 are classified as ERα+/TAM+ and 1359 are classified as ERα-/TAM-. The ProBe CaRe study is a population-based cohortstudy nested in a nearly complete source population, clinical, tumour anddemographic data were abstracted from DBCG registry data. Linkage to Danishregistries allows for abstraction of information regarding comorbid conditions,comedication use and mortality. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sampleshave been prepared for DNA extraction and immunohistochemical assay.FINDINGS TO DATE: To mitigate incorrect classification of patients into specific categories, we conducted a validation substudy. We compared data acquired fromregistry and from medical record review to calculate positive predictive values(PPVs) and negative predictive values. We observed PPVs near 100% for tumoursize, lymph node involvement, receptor status, surgery type, receipt ofradiotherapy, receipt of chemotherapy and TAM treatment. We found that the PPVswere 96% (95% CI 83% to 100%) for change in endocrine therapy and 61% (95% CI 42%to 77%) for menopausal transition.FUTURE PLANS: The ProBeCaRe cohort study is well positioned to comprehensivelyexamine pharmacogenetic variants. We will use a Bayesian pathway analysis toevaluate the complete TAM metabolic path to allow for gene-gene interactions,incorporating information of other important patient characteristics.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.
