On the basis of this hypothesis,it was proposed that anti-angiogenic drugs should be able to suppress the growth of all solid tumours. However, clinical experience with anti-angiogenic agentshas shown that this is not always the case. Reports of tumours growing withoutthe formation of new vessels can be found in the literature dating back to the1800s, yet no formal recognition, description and demonstration of their special biological status was made until recently. In 1996, we formally recognized anddescribed non-angiogenic tumours in lungs where the only blood vessels presentwere those originating from normal lung tissue. This is far from an isolatedscenario, as non-angiogenic tumour growth has now been observed in tumours ofmany different organs in both humans and preclinical animal models. In thisOpinion article, we summarize how these tumours were discovered and discuss what we know so far about their biology and the potential implications of thisknowledge for cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1038/nrc.2018.14 PMID: 29520090
