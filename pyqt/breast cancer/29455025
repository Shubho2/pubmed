Inthis work, we designed a new type of flexible and robust nanohybridmicroelectrode by modifying carbon fiber with dual nanoenzyme, i.e., AuPd alloynanoparticles (AuPd-ANPs) decorated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) assembly, andexplored its practical application in electrochemical sensing system forsensitive detection of cancer biomarker hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in human breast cancer cells and tissue. For the preparation of dual nanoenzyme modifiedmicroelectrode, ionic liquid was used as the electrolyte for the effectiveelectrodeposition of GQDs on carbon fiber substrate to form a close-packedassembly under a very negative potential, then the highly dense AuPd-ANPs wereuniformly decorated on GQDs assembly by electrodeposition. In virtue of thestructural merits and synergistic contribution of dual nanoenzyme in enhancingthe electrocatalytic activity to H2O2, the resultant nanohybrid microelectrodeexhibited good sensing performances for electrochemical detection of H2O2,including a high sensitivity of 371 μA cm-2 mM-1, a wide linear range from 1.0 μMto 18.44 mM, a low detection limit of 500 nM (a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1), aswell as good selectivity and biocompatibility, which could be used for real-time tracking H2O2 released from different types of human breast cells and in situsensitive detection of H2O2 in clinical breast cancer tissue.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
