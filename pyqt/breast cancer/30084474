A longerlifespan and easier access to modern diagnostic and therapeutic methods are themain reasons for the growing number of cancer survivors. Additionally, some typesof oncological treatment, such as radiotherapy or immunosuppression, may alsoincrease the risk of secondary tumors. These factors have resulted in anincreased incidence of primary multiple cancers. Multiple primary cancers aregenerally under-stood as either synchronous, in which the cancers occur at thesame time, or metachronous, in which the cancers follow in sequence (forinstance, more than 2 months apart).The results published in other studies showthat between 2% and 15.8% of all cancer patients have more primary multiplecancers. Within this group with multiple primary cancers, some have bilateralbreast cancer, and our study focuses on patients from this group.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study describes 10 patients who were treated forbilateral synchronous breast cancer at the Cracow Branch of the MariaSkłodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology during theyears 1992-2014 and who developed another primary tumor after their treatmentbilateral synchronous breast cancer.RESULTS: In our discussion we present detailed data on the incidence ofmetachronous cancers in the 10 patients, including breast cancer, following thetreatment of their other primary tumors.CONCLUSION: The 10 cases of our study, and clinical experiences and publications in general show how important it is for patients to continue medical follow-upafter treatment of primary tumors, not only to detect recurrences as early aspos-sible, but also to diagnose any other malignancies occurring in other sites, including secondary, treatment-related tumors.DOI: 10.5603/GP.a2018.0041 PMID: 30084474
