Electronic address:zhouqf@rcees.ac.cn.Polyfluorinated iodine alkanes (PFIs) are a kind of emerging chemicals withendocrine disrupting effects. Based on the different binding preferences of PFIs to estrogen receptor alpha and beta isoforms (ERα and β), two representativePFIs, dodecafluoro-1,6-diiodohexane (PFHxDI) and tridecafluorohexyl iodide(PFHxI), were selected to evaluate their effects on the proliferation of twokinds of breast cancer cells with different ERα/β expression levels, MCF-7 andT47D. The cell viability assay showed PFHxDI could cause higher cellular toxicitythan did PFHxI in both MCF-7 and T47D. MCF-7 with relatively higher ERα/βexpression ratio was more vulnerable to the cytotoxic treatments of PFHxI andPFHxDI when compared with T47D cells with relatively lower ERα/β expressionratio. EdU incorporation and cell cycle analysis revealed that, similar to17β-estrodiol (E2), non-cytotoxic levels of PFHxDI could significantly promotethe proliferation of MCF-7 by increasing cell population at S phase (p < 0.01),while T47D proliferation was not influenced by PFHxI exposure due to cell cyclearrest at G2/M phase. The cellular responses caused by estrogenic PFIs weredominantly mediated by their preferential binding affinities for ER isoforms,which would be helpful in the accurate assessment for their potential influences on the breast cancer progression.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
