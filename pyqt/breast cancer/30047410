Herein, we report the design andsynthesis of two series of 6-(2-substitutedacetamido)-4-anilinoquinazolines (6a-xand 13a-d) as EGFR inhibitors. All the newly synthesized quinazoline derivatives were in vitro evaluated for their anti-proliferative activity towards MCF-7(Breast Cancer) and HepG2 (Hepatocellular carcinoma) cell lines. In particular,compound 6n showed significant inhibitory activity against MCF-7 and HepG2 celllines (IC50 = 3 and 16 μM, respectively), compared to that of Erlotinib(IC50 = 20 and 25 μM, respectively). Western blotting of 6n at MCF-7 cell linerevealed the dual inhibitory activity of 6n towards diminishing thephosphorylated levels for EGFR and ERK. Also, ELISA assay confirmed the anti-EGFRactivity of compound 6n (IC50 = 0.037 μM). Finally, a molecular docking studyshowed the potential binding mode of 6n within the ATP catalytic binding site of EGFR, exhibiting similar binding mode to EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
