In this article, we introduce a newframework to examine why women choose mastectomy versus breast conserving therapyin early stage breast cancer, and highlight the importance of utilizing aconceptual framework to guide clinical research.METHODS: The framework we present was developed through integrating previousliterature, frameworks, theories, models, and the author's past research.RESULTS: We present a conceptual framework that illustrates the central domainsthat influence women's choice between mastectomy versus breast conservingtherapy. These have been organized into three broad constructs:clinicopathological factors, physician factors, and individual factors withsubgroups of sociodemographic, geographic, and individual belief factors. The aimof this framework is to provide a comprehensive basis to describe, examine, andexplain the factors that influence women's choice of mastectomy versus breastconserving therapy at the individual level.CONCLUSION: We have developed a framework with the purpose of helping health careworkers and policy makers better understand the multitude of factors thatinfluence a patient's choice of therapy at an individual level. We hope thisframework is useful for future scholars to utilize, challenge, and build upon in their own work on decision-making in the setting of breast cancer. Forclinician-researchers who have limited experience with frameworks, this paperwill highlight the importance of utilizing a conceptual framework to guide futureresearch and provide an example.DOI: 10.1186/s12874-018-0533-7 PMCID: PMC6038174PMID: 29986654
