China.Previous studies have indicated that phospholipase A2 (PLA2) may be associatedwith tumorigenesis in human tissues. The present study aimed to investigate theassociation between plasma PLA2 activity and the breast cancer (BC) status ofpatients. Increased plasma PLA2 activity was detected in patients with breastcancer when compared with healthy controls. Plasma samples were obtained frompatients with BC (n=169), patients with benign disease (BD; n=80) and healthycontrols (n=81). PLA2 activity was assessed using a quantitative fluorescentassay with selective inhibitors. It was demonstrated that increased PLA2 andsecretory PLA2 (sPLA2) activity was associated with tumor stage, particularly in patients with late-stage disease. Additionally, smoking, alcohol consumption,body mass index (BMI) and age of patients did not have a significant effect onPLA2 activity. Analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves revealed thatplasma PLA2 and sPLA2 activities were increased in BC patients compared withhealthy controls. It was concluded that plasma PLA2 activity may serve as abiomarker for patients with BC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7915 PMCID: PMC5835902PMID: 29541252
