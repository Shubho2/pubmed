Electronic address: pedraza@unam.mx.Cancer is a relevant public health problem that represents the second leadingcause of global death. In this regard, cisplatin is a highly effectiveantineoplastic drug used in treatment of several types of cancer, such as headand neck, testicular, ovarian, gastric, lung and breast cancer. Nevertheless,treatment with this compound leads to nephrotoxicity, which limits its use.Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in cisplatin-induced renal damage andseveral dietary antioxidants have been reported to ameliorate this secondaryeffect. Relevant findings on the protective effects of these antioxidant agentsin cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity are summarized in this paper. Further,limitations of animal models used in these studies are discussed. Additionally,clinical studies on the protective effect of these antioxidants, as well asfuture directions for these kind of trials are also considered.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
