We examine the implications of mitochondrialvesicle formation of mitoautophagosomes (MAPS) in response to the cytotoxic drug MKT-077, which targets mortalin, in a drug-resistant breast carcinoma cell lineoverexpressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The breast cancer cell line MCF-7Adr isderived from MCF-7, but differs from its ancestral line in tolerance ofMKT-077-induced mitochondrial toxicity. Our ultrastructural observations suggest that autophagy in the MCF-7Adr cells entails regional sequestration of MKT077 in multilamellar LC3-labeled MAPS, which then separate from their mitochondria, and fuse with or engulf each other. MAPS appeared to be migrating through thecytoplasm and fusing with the plasma membrane, thus carrying out exocytoticsecretion. This mechanism, which seems ineffective in the ancestral cell line,provides a resistance mechanism for MKT-077 by enhancing the efflux process ofthe cells. After 8Â hr of MKT-077 exposure, a fraction of the resistant cellsappeared viable and contained larger number of smaller sized mitochondria.Mitoautophagosomes, therefore, provide a potentially novel model for multidrugresistance in cancerous cells and may contribute to the P-gp efflux process.DOI: 10.1080/01913123.2017.1419328 PMCID: PMC6060621PMID: 29419344
