Research has demonstrated that AhR signaling also plays a vital role in BCinitiation and development as well. Therefore, blocking this pathway to naturalinterferences paves a new channel for the prevention of BC. Several naturalcompounds such as flavonoids possess the anticancer activities against different cancers.Objective: The present study has been designed to estimate the chemotherapeuticpotential of taxifolin (TAX) against 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene(DMBA)-induced mammary carcinoma in Sprague-Dawley rats.Materials and Methods: Initially, the molecular docking analysis of AhR andcytochrome P450s (CYPs) (CYP1A1 and CYP1B1) was performed using MAESTRO tool, in an attempt to rationalize the activity of TAX, based on their CYP1-bindingpotential. The in vitro CYP1A1 activity was determined by luciferase assay withCYP1A1 substrate luciferin CEE. The in vivo analysis was performed byadministrating TAX at 10, 20, 40 mg/kg BW for 28 days intragastrically in DMBAinduced (25 mg/animal dose) at 55 days of age Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. BCinitiates after 90 days of tumor induction phase. The molecular mechanism of TAX on Ahr and CYPs was also examined through the mRNA and protein expressions using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blottinganalysis.Results: Furthermore, TAX altered the energy regulation on DMBA-induced BC in SD rats by considerably restoring the cancer-induced modulations in tumor growth.Our results showed that TAX reduced the expressions of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 inDMBA-induced mammary carcinoma by downregulating the AhR signaling pathway.Conclusion: This study revealed that TAX might be able to act as achemotherapeutic agent against CYP1A1- and CYP1B1-mediated cancer and theinhibition of the DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis in a ratmodel.Abbreviations used: CYPs: Cytochrome P450s; PAH: polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons; HRP- Horseradish peroxidase; BSA: Bovine serum albumin; DTTP:Deoxythymidine Triphosphate (nucleotide); RT-qPCR: Real Time quantitativepolymerase chain reaction; CADD: Computer Aided Drug Drafting.DOI: 10.4103/pm.pm_315_17 PMCID: PMC5822495PMID: 29491628
