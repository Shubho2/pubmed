Secondary purposes were to compare the predictive value ofMRI-based response patterns measured halfway through NAC and after NAC and tomeasure interobserver variability.METHODS: All consecutive patients treated with NAC for primary invasive breastcancer from 2012 to 2015 and who underwent breast MRI before, halfway through(and after) NAC were included. All breast tumors were reassessed on MRI by twoexperienced breast radiologists and classified into six patterns: type 0(complete radiologic response); type 1 (concentric shrinkage); type 2(crumbling); type 3 (diffuse enhancement); type 4 (stable disease); type 5(progressive disease). Percentages of tumors showing pathological completeresponse (pCR), > 50% tumor reduction and > 50% tumor diameter reduction perMRI-based response pattern were calculated. Correlation between MRI-basedresponse patterns and pathological tumor reduction was studied with Pearson'scorrelation coefficient, and interobserver agreement was tested with Cohen'sKappa.RESULTS: Patients (n = 76; mean age 53, range 29-72 years) with 80 tumors (4bilateral) were included. There was significant correlation between theseMRI-based response patterns halfway through NAC and tumor reduction on pathology assessment (reader 1 r = 0.33; p = 0.003 and reader 2 r = 0.45; p < 0.001).Type-0, type-1 or type-2 patterns halfway through NAC showed highest tumorreduction rates on pathology assessment, with > 50% tumor reduction in 90%, 78%and 65% of cases, respectively. In 83% of tumors with type 0 halfway through NAC,pathology assessment showed pCR. There was no significant correlation betweenMRI-based response patterns after NAC and tumor reduction rates on pathologyassessment (reader 1 r = - 0.17; p = 0.145 and reader 2 r = - 0.17; p = 0.146).In 41% of tumors with type 0 after NAC, pathology assessment showed pCR.CONCLUSION: MRI-based response patterns halfway through NAC can predictpathologic response more accurately than MRI-based response patterns after NAC.Complete radiological response halfway NAC is associated with 83% pCR, whilecomplete radiological response after NAC seems to be correct in only 41% ofcases.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0950-x PMCID: PMC5907188PMID: 29669584
