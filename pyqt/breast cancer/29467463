Cancers frequently expresstransforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), which drives immune dysfunction in the tumormicroenvironment by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inhibiting CD8+ andTH1 cells. To address this therapeutic challenge, we invent bifunctionalantibody-ligand traps (Y-traps) comprising an antibody targeting CTLA-4 or PD-L1 fused to a TGFβ receptor II ectodomain sequence that simultaneously disablesautocrine/paracrine TGFβ in the target cell microenvironment (a-CTLA4-TGFβRIIecd and a-PDL1-TGFβRIIecd). a-CTLA4-TGFβRIIecd is more effective in reducingtumor-infiltrating Tregs and inhibiting tumor progression compared with CTLA-4antibody (Ipilimumab). Likewise, a-PDL1-TGFβRIIecd exhibits superior antitumorefficacy compared with PD-L1 antibodies (Atezolizumab or Avelumab). Our datademonstrate that Y-traps counteract TGFβ-mediated differentiation of Tregs andimmune tolerance, thereby providing a potentially more effectiveimmunotherapeutic strategy against cancers that are resistant to current immunecheckpoint inhibitors.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-02696-6 PMCID: PMC5821872PMID: 29467463  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
