The aim of this study wasto evaluate the presence and expression of miRs in breast cancer samples fromdifferent ethnic groups.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Breast cancer tissue from 4 ethnic groups, i.e., BritishCaucasian, British Black, Nigerian, and Indian, were identified and matched forpatients' age, tumour grade/type, and 10 × 10 µm sections taken. Tumour areaswere macrodissected, total RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesised. cDNA was applied to human miScript PCR arrays allowing the quantification of 84 of themost abundantly expressed/best-characterised miRs.RESULTS: Differential expression of 9 miRs was seen across the 4 groups.Significantly higher levels of miR-140-5p, miR-194 and miR-423-5p (the last ofwhich harbours the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs6505162) were seen in thebreast tumours of Nigerian patients when compared with other ethnic groups (all p< 0.0001). miR-101 was overexpressed in breast cancers in the Indian patients. Anin silico analysis of miR-423-5p showed that the AC genotype is mainly associatedwith Europeans (57%), while Asians display mostly CC (approx. 60%), and Africans mainly AA (approx. 60%).CONCLUSIONS: This study shows divergence in miR expression in breast cancers fromdifferent ethnic groups, and suggests that specific genetic variants in miR genesmay affect breast cancer risk in these groups. Predicted targets of these miRsmay uncover useful biomarkers that could have clinical value in breast cancers indifferent ethnic groups.© 2018 S.
