Epub 2012 Feb1.Significant Risks of Oral Contraceptives (OCPs): Why This Drug Class Should NotBe Included in a Preventive Care Mandate.Peck R(1), Norris CW(2).Author information: (1)Certified clinical densitometer, and Marquette Method NFP teacher.(2)Georgetown University School of Medicine.Pregnancy is not a disease. But more fundamentally, neither is human fertility.They are normal physiologic processes of the sexually mature person. Byclassifying pregnancy and fertility as disease states, certain entities are able to position contraception as "the cure." Currently, these same organizations wantto include oral contraceptive counseling and medications in the new nationalhealth-care plan under a preventive care mandate. But it is the physician's role to counsel patients on preventive care measures. We understand that theseevidenced-based screenings help to change risky behaviors and catch disease inits earliest stages, thereby reducing patients' overall morbidity and mortality. However, we believe that patients incur substantial health risks when choosingoral contraceptives (OCPs). This paper reviews the major risks of OCPs. Theauthors presume that the prevailing widespread acceptance and promotion of OCPsindicates general agreement within the medical community that OCPs are good forthe patient (or at least not significantly harmful). Therefore, this paperconcentrates on the studies which show increased harm and risk to the patientchoosing to use OCPs. We have concentrated our efforts on three major areas:increased rates of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, and humanpapillomavirus (HPV) or cervical cancer. If fertility and pregnancy are notdisease states, and are, in fact, normal conditions associated with healthyindividuals, OCPs fail the most important test of preventive medicine: theyincrease risk of disease instead of decreasing it. Patients should not be misled or confused into believing that what they are taking is "good for them" and is ofthe same beneficial effect as other preventive measures.DOI: 10.1179/002436312803571447 PMCID: PMC6027089PMID: 30082959
