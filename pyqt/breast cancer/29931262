Few studies have examined to what extent chronic stress in distinct life domains affectsdepressive symptoms.Purpose: Chronic stress in vocational and intimate partner life domains, andtheir interaction, were tested as predictors of depressive symptoms after breast cancer diagnosis.Methods: Women (N = 460) completed validated interviews regarding chronic stress in specific life domains shortly after diagnosis and a measure of depressivesymptoms every 6 weeks for 6 months.Results: In latent growth curve modeling analyses, greater chronic stress in work(b = 2.90; p < .001) and intimate partner domains (b = 1.38, p = .02) wasassociated with higher depressive symptoms at study entry (intercept), andgreater work stress predicted faster recovery from depressive symptoms over time (b = -0.10; p = .01). The two domains of chronic stress also interactedsignificantly on depressive symptoms at study entry (b = -1.54; p < .02) and overtime (b = 0.14; p < .001). Greater work stress was associated with higherdepressive symptoms at study entry regardless of intimate partner stress, butgreater intimate partner stress was associated with higher depressive symptomswhen work stress was low. The decline over 6 months in initially elevateddepressive symptoms predicted by high work stress was significantly steeper when intimate partner stress was low.Conclusions: Targeting interventions to recently diagnosed breast cancer patientsliving with chronically stressful vocational and intimate partner lifecircumstances could be worthwhile.DOI: 10.1093/abm/kay045 PMID: 29931262
