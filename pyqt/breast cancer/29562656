B.Burwinkel@dkfz-heidelberg.de.Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women and has high mortalityrates. Early detection is supposed to be critical for the patient's prognosis. Inrecent years, several studies have investigated global DNA methylation profilesand gene-specific DNA methylation in blood-based DNA to develop putativescreening markers for cancer. However, most of the studies have not yet beenvalidated. In our study, we analyzed the promoter methylation of RASSF1A and ATM in peripheral blood DNA of 229 sporadic patients and 151 healthy controls by the MassARRAY EpiTYPER assay. There were no significant differences in DNAmethylation levels of RASSF1A and ATM between the sporadic BC cases and thehealthy controls. Furthermore, we performed the Infinium HumanMethylation450BeadChip (450K) array analysis using 48 sporadic BC cases and 48 healthy controls(cases and controls are the same from those of the MassARRAY EpiTYPER assay) and made a comparison with the published data. No significant differences werepresented in DNA methylation levels of RASSF1A and ATM between the sporadic BCcases and the healthy controls. So far, the evidence for powerful blood-basedmethylation markers is still limited and the identified markers need to befurther validated.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19030900 PMCID: PMC5877761PMID: 29562656
