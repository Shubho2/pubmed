CAFs featurea high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which is not detectablein adult normal tissue but associated with a poor prognosis in cancer patients.Methods: Based on a FAP specific enzyme inhibitor (FAPI) we developed aniodinated and a DOTA-coupled radiotracer which were evaluated in vitro usinguptake, competition and efflux studies as well as confocal microscopy of afluorescence labeled variant. Furthermore, imaging and biodistribution studieswere done in tumor-bearing animals. Finally, proof of concept was realized byimaging patients with 68Ga-labeled FAPI. Results: Both FAPIs showed a highspecificity, affinity and rapid internalization into FAP expressing cells both invitro and in vivo. Biodistribution studies in tumor-bearing mice as well as infirst cancer patients demonstrated high intratumoral uptake of the tracer and afast body clearance, resulting in high-contrast images and negligible radiationexposure of healthy tissue. A first comparison with the commonly used radiotracer18F-FDG revealed a clear superiority of the new FAP ligand in one patient withlocally advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: Radiolabeled FAPIs allow fastimaging with very high contrast in tumors having a high stromal content and may, therefore, serve as pantumor agents. The coupling of these molecules to DOTA orother chelators allows labeling not only with 68Ga, but also with therapeuticisotopes such as 177Lu or 90Y.Copyright © 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.210435 PMID: 29626120
