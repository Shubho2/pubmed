Electronicaddress: olivericonti@unict.it.Phthalates are endocrine-disrupting for their ability to change the normalfunction of human endocrine system. Their action on the reproductive system, bothon male and female, is the most one investigated by international scientificcommunity. The aim of this systematic review was to gather the availableinformation regarding the role of phthalates on breast carcinogenesis focusingour research in their intake through the diet. Research was performed accordingthe PRISMA methodology and 25 scientific articles published between 2000 and 2018were selected. The main source of exposure to phthalates is diet, mainly through the consumption of food and beverages wrapped in different plastic packaging.Several in vitro studies suggest that certain phthalates may be associated tobreast cancer since they can bind and activate the estrogen receptors. However,results of epidemiological studies are debated, yet. It's necessary to plan thefuture studies more carefully to have more representative data on phthalateexposure by replacing urinary matrix with piliferous one, by including asconfounding factors not only the other risk factors but also prevention one asdiet and miRNA expression and, finally, by direct the study considering not only the estrogenic activity of phthalates and so including also the ER negativetumors.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
