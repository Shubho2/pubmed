Morenotably CD44 overexpression has been shown in a number of different cancer stemcells (CSC) which are present in many solid tumors and drive growth, recurrence, and resistance to conventional therapies. Triple negative breast cancer CSCscorrelate to worse prognosis and early relapse due to higher drug resistance and increased tumor heterogeneity and thus are prime targets for anticancer therapy. To specifically target cells overexpressing CD44 receptors, including CSCs, wesynthesized a pentameric nanocomplex (PNC) containing gold nanoparticles,doxorubicin (Dox) conjugated to thiolated hyaluronic acid via an acid-labilehydrazone bond, and thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) DNA CD44 aptamer. In vitrodrug release was highest at 8 h time point at acidic pH (pH 4.7) and in 10 mMglutathione. The PNC is almost an order of magnitude more effective than Doxalone in CD44+ cells versus CD44 low cells. Functionally, the PNC reduced CSCself-renewal. The PNC provides a therapeutic strategy that can improve theefficiency of Dox and decrease nontargeted toxicity thereby prolonging its use toindividual patients.DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b01168 PMCID: PMC6044869PMID: 30023561
