There was astatistically significant difference in the time-to-biopsy among women who hadincomplete mammograms and women who had comorbid conditions.CONCLUSIONS: This data indicates that county services provide clinical follow-up in compliance with recommended guidelines of 30 days. However, women withincomplete mammograms and comorbid conditions may be at a higher risk ofexperiencing delays in diagnosis and treatment.DOI: 10.1353/hpu.2018.0030 PMID: 29503311
