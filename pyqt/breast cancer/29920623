The precise nature of the interaction between MET and SIL was further analyzed through the median-effect method. In addition,qRT-PCR was applied to determine the expression levels of hTERT and cyclin D1genes after 48 h drug exposure.RESULTS: MTT assays showed that MET and SIL individually inhibited the cellviability in a dose and time-dependent manner, and the obtained combinationindices (CIs) were<1 for all the combination treatments, indicating that theanticancer agents synergistically induced growth inhibition in the breast cancer cells. qPCR findings revealed that the drug combination also synergisticallydown-regulated the expression levels of hTERT and cyclin D1 at all usedconcentrations compared with the drugs used alone after 48 h treatment (P≤0.05).CONCLUSION: The results provide evidence that synergistic antiproliferativeeffects of MET and SIL, linking to the down-regulation of Cyclin D1 and hTERTgenes, and propose that MET+SIL may have therapeutic value in breast cancertherapy.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.DOI: 10.1055/a-0631-8046 PMID: 29920623
