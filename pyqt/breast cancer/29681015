Outcome measures included the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, theBrief Pain Inventory, and quantitative sensory testing. Data were measured ateach of six time points-baseline, post-treatment (approximately 2 weeks after thelast paclitaxel infusion), and at the first, fifth, ninth, and final weeklypaclitaxel treatments.RESULTS: Of 29 randomized participants, 20 (69%) received at least onecryotherapy treatment, and 11 (38%) received all four cryotherapy treatments. Ten(34%) participants could not tolerate the cryotherapy, and six (21%) declinedfurther participation at some point during the trial. Only seven participants(24%) were available for the final post-chemotherapy QST and questionnaires.There were no significant differences in measures of neuropathy or pain betweentreated and untreated hands or feet.CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to prevent painful peripheral neuropathy are urgentlyneeded. In this current trial, dropout due to discomfort precluded adequate powerto fully understand the potential benefits of cryotherapy. Much more research is needed to discover safe and effective preventive strategies that can be easilyimplemented within busy infusion centers.DOI: 10.1007/s00520-018-4199-9 PMID: 29681015
