There arefew reports on the association of NET response and long-term outcomes.Objectives: To investigate the prognostic value of clinical response to NET.Methods: Long-term outcomes of NET were examined in 107 patients who participatedin the multicentre prospective neoadjuvant exemestane study, JFMC34-0601.Patients were treated with 25 mg/day exemestane for 16 weeks followed by an8-week extension depending on the treatment response.Results: Clinical response included partial response (PR) in 58 patients, stable disease in 41 patients and progressive disease (PD) in 8 patients. Clinicalresponse was significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS), distantdisease-free survival (DDFS) and overall survival (OS) (P<0.0001 for all).Especially, patients with PD showed markedly poor outcomes with median DFS=17.8months (HR (vs PR): 7.7 (95% CI 1.6 to 33)) and median OS=37.7 months (HR (vsPR): 26.3 (95% CI 2.4 to 655)). Preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI)were associated with DFS and marginally with OS (P=0.022 and 0.066,respectively). PEPI=0 indicated an excellent prognosis with 95% 5-year DFS (95%CI 73 to 99). In the multivariate analysis including T stage, nodal status andKi67, clinical response was an independent prognostic factor for DFS, DDFS and OS(P=0.032, 0.0007 and 0.020, respectively), whereas PEPI was marginally associatedwith DFS and OS (P=0.079 and 0.068, respectively).Conclusions: Clinical response to NET showed an independent prognostic value.Patients with PD had markedly poor prognosis, indicating a need of additionaltherapy. PEPI=0 indicated an excellent prognosis. The integration of clinicalresponse and PEPI would improve decision-making with regard to treatment options for endocrine-responsive breast cancer when these results are validated in alarger clinical trial.Trial registration number: UMIN C000000345.DOI: 10.1136/esmoopen-2017-000314 PMCID: PMC5844383PMID: 29531841
