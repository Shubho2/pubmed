Our meta-analysis aimed to better elucidateits activity, efficacy and safety.Material and methods: A systematic search of Medline, Web of Science andconferences proceedings up to 30 October 2017 was carried out to identifyrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating platinum-based versusplatinum-free neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC patients. Using the fixed andrandom effects models, pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for pathological complete response(pCR, defined as ypT0/is pN0), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS)and grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs: neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and neuropathy).Results: Nine RCTs (N = 2109) were included. Overall, platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased pCR rate from 37.0% to 52.1% (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.46-2.62, P < 0.001). Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy remainedsignificantly associated with increased pCR rate also after restricting theanalysis to the three RCTs (N = 611) that used the same standard regimen in both groups of weekly paclitaxel (with or without carboplatin) followed byanthracycline and cyclophosphamide (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.37-4.66, P = 0.003).Conversely, among the 96 BRCA-mutated patients included in two RCTs, the additionof carboplatin was not associated with significantly increased pCR rate (OR 1.17,95% CI 0.51-2.67, P = 0.711). Two RCTs (N = 748) reported survival outcomes: nosignificant difference in EFS (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49-1.06, P = 0.094) and OS (HR0.86, 95% CI 0.46-1.63, P = 0.651) was observed. A significant higher risk ofgrade 3 and 4 hematological AEs, with no increased risk of grade 3 and 4neuropathy was observed with platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Conclusion: In TNBC patients, platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy isassociated with significantly increased pCR rates at the cost of worsehematological toxicities. Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy may beconsidered an option in TNBC patients.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018080042.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy127 PMID: 29873695
