Objective cognitive performance was assessed by theNeuroCog FX test, a short computerized screening (duration <30 minutes) whichassesses working memory, alertness, verbal/figural memory, andlanguage/executive. Patients' test performance was correlated with treatmentfactors (chemo-, radiotherapy), subjective performance (FEDA), depression(PHQ-9), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-30), and clinical characteristics.RESULTS: From February 2013 to December 2014, a clinically homogenous sample of476 patients was recruited (early tumor stage [T0-T2]: 93%; node-negative: 67%;chemotherapy: 61%; radiotherapy: 84%). NeuroCog FX could be administered in 439patients (92%; median age: 50 [24-62] years). Patients showed decreasedperformance in attentional-executive functions (but not verbal/figural memory)and a 3-fold rate of CD in terms of below average performance in at least 1cognitive domain (42%). Approximately 40% of the patients also reportedsubjective cognitive impairment (FEDA). No therapy-specific effect on testperformance was obtained in the NeuroCog FX test.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer survivors showed objective attentional-executive andsubjective cognitive impairments. No therapy-specific adverse side effect onobjective cognitive performance was found. Depression strongly contributed toobjective and subjective cognitive complaints and reduced quality of life.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4763 PMID: 29771474
