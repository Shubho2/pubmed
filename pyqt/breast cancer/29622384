We studied the association betweenchemotherapy relative dose intensity (RDI) and overall survival (OS) amongpatients with advanced breast or ovarian cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adults withadvanced breast or ovarian cancer who received first-line myelosuppressivechemotherapy (January 2007 to December 2010) in US Oncology Network communitypractices. Dose delays ≥ 7 days, dose reductions ≥ 15%, and RDI relative tostandard regimens were described. OS was measured by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: Among 874 patients with advanced breast cancer, 33.2% experienced dosedelays ≥ 7 days, 48.7% experienced dose reductions ≥ 15%, and 38.9% had RDI <85%. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, Eastern CooperativeOncology Group performance status 1/2 versus 0 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.45; 95%confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.82) and triple-negative status (HR = 3.14; 95%CI, 1.15-8.62) were significantly associated with mortality. Among 170 patientswith advanced ovarian cancer, 43.5% experienced dose delays ≥ 7 days, 48.2%experienced dose reductions ≥ 15%, and 46.5% had RDI < 85%. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, dose reductions ≥ 15% (HR = 1.94; 95% CI,1.09-3.46) and other tumor histology (vs. nonserous adenocarcinoma; HR = 3.55;95% CI, 1.38-9.09) were significantly associated with mortality.CONCLUSION: Dose delays, dose reductions, and reduced RDI were common. Inadvanced breast cancer, health status and triple-negative disease weresignificantly associated with mortality. In advanced ovarian cancer, dosereductions and tumor histology were significantly associated with mortality.These results can help identify potential risk factors and characterize theeffect of chemotherapy dose modification strategies on mortality.Copyright © 2018.
