We used inverse propensity score weighting to accountfor differences by sexual orientation in age and length of the survivor-caregiverrelationship and simultaneous equation models consistent with the needs foranalyzing dyadic data.RESULTS: Survivors and caregivers reported stress levels consistent withpopulation norms, irrespective of survivors' sexual orientation. Accounting forcovariates, survivors' and caregivers' stress did not mutually influence oneanother overall. However, differences by sexual orientation were noted such that caregivers' stress was influential for sexual minority survivors' stress, but notfor heterosexual survivors' stress.CONCLUSIONS: Careful consideration should be given to caregivers of sexualminority survivors, an underserved group for whom currently no interventionsexist.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4836 PMID: 29959808
