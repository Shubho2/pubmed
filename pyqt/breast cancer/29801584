It isconverted to more active metabolites by enzymes encoded by polymorphic genes,including cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and transported by ATP-binding cassettetransporters. Genetic polymorphisms that confer reduced CYP2D6 activity orconcurrent use of CYP2D6-inhibiting drugs may reduce the clinical efficacy oftamoxifen. The issue of the clinical utility of CYP2D6 genotype testing issubject to considerable and ongoing academic and clinical controversy. In thischapter, we outline tamoxifen's clinical pharmacology and give an overview of theresearch to date on the association between CYP2D6 inhibition and tamoxifeneffectiveness. Based on the evidence to date, the impact of drug-induced and/orgene-induced inhibition of CYP2D6 activity is likely to be null or small, or atmost moderate in subjects carrying two reduced function alleles. Future research should examine the effect of polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes intamoxifen's complete metabolic pathway, should comprehensively evaluate otherbiomarkers that affect tamoxifen effectiveness, such as the transport enzymes,and focus on subgroups of patients, such as premenopausal breast cancer patients,for whom tamoxifen is the only guideline approved endocrine therapy.Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
