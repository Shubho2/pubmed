BnSP-6 was able toinduce a higher cytotoxic and genotoxic activity in MDA-MB-231 cells, whencompared to MCF10A (a non-tumorigenic breast cell line), suggesting that thisprotein presented a possible preference for cancer cells. BnSP-6 inhibitedMDA-MB-231 proliferation at 24, 48 and 72 h. In addition, BnSP-6 inducedsignificant increase in the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells, a marker of DNAdamage. To obtain novel insight into the direct DNA damage interference inMDA-MB-231 survival and proliferation, we evaluated cell cycle progression.BnSP-6 produced a significant decrease in 2N (G1) and an increase in the G2/Mphase and this capacity is likely related to the modulation of expression ofprogression cell cycle-associated genes (CCND1, CCNE1, CDC25A, CHEK2, E2F1, CDH-1and NF-kB). Taken together, these results indicate that BnSP-6 induces DNA damagein breast cancer cells and is an attractive model for developing innovativetherapeutic agents against breast cancer.Copyright © 2018.
