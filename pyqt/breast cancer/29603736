However, it is unclear whether this holds true in a modernhealthcare setting in which breast cancer surgery is carried out within weeks to months of diagnosis. This is a population- and register-based study of all women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the Stockholm-Gotland healthcare region in Sweden, 2001-2008, and who were initially operated. Follow-up of vital status ended 2014. 7,017 women were included in analysis. Our main outcome was overallsurvival. Main analyses were carried out using Cox proportional hazards models.We adjusted for likely confounders and stratified on mode of detection, tumorsize and lymph node metastasis. We found that a longer interval between date ofmorphological diagnosis and therapeutic surgery was associated with a poorerprognosis. Assuming a linear association, the hazard rate of death from allcauses increased by 1.011 (95% CI 1.006-1.017) per day. Comparing, for example,surgery 6 weeks after diagnosis to surgery 3 weeks after diagnosis, therebyconfers a 1.26-fold increased hazard rate. The increase in hazard rate associatedwith surgical delay was strongest in women with largest tumors. Whilst there was a clear association between delays and survival in women without lymph nodemetastasis, the association may be attenuated in subgroups with increasing numberof lymph node metastases. We found no evidence of an interaction between time to surgery and mode of detection. In conclusion, unwarranted delays to primarytreatment of breast cancer should be avoided.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31411 PMID: 29603736
