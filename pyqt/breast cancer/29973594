Existing therapeutics that block CXCR4 signaling are dependenton single molecule-receptor interactions or silencing CXCR4 expression. CXCR4localizes in lipid rafts and forms dimers therefore CXCR4 targeting and signalingmay depend on ligand density. Herein, we report liposomes presenting a CXCR4binding peptide (DV1) as a three-dimensional molecular array, ranging from 9k to 74k molecules Î¼m-2, target triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC cellsexhibit a maxima in binding and uptake of DV1-functionalized liposomes (L-DV1) invitro at a specific density, which yields a significant reduction in cellmigration. This density inhibits metastasis from a primary tumor for 27 days,resulting from peptide density dependent gene regulation. We show thatcomplementing cell membrane receptor expression may be a strategy for targetingcells and regulating signaling.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05035-5 PMCID: PMC6031661PMID: 29973594
