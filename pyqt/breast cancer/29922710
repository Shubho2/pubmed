While the direct mechanism remains uncertain, aspirin cansuppress the COX-dependent and independent pathways involved in tumorprogression. We hypothesized that aspirin users with clear cell ovarian cancerwould have improved survival outcomes. We performed a retrospective review ofpatients with clear cell ovarian cancer diagnosed between 1995 and 2010, andfollowed outcomes through 2016. Patients underwent primary cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. Aspirin use was defined by medicationdocumentation in two records more than six months apart. Statistical testsincluded Fisher's exact, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Seventy-seven patients met inclusion criteria. Fifty-four patients (70%) had stage I-IIdisease. Thirteen patients (17%) used aspirin. Aspirin users had a statistically longer disease-free survival compared to non-users (HR 0.13, p = .018). Whilemedian disease-free survival was not reached for either group, 1 of 13 (8%)aspirin users recurred at 24 months, compared to 18 of 64 (28%) non-users.Aspirin users demonstrated longer overall survival (HR 0.13, p = .015). Mediansurvival was not reached for aspirin users, compared to 166 months for non-users.Aspirin use retained significance (HR 0.13, p = .044) after controlling for age, stage and cytoreductive status. In this small cohort of women with clear cellovarian cancer, aspirin use correlated with improved disease-free and overallsurvival, and retained independent significance as a positive prognostic factor. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings before consideringaspirin as a therapeutic intervention.DOI: 10.1016/j.gore.2018.06.004 PMCID: PMC6005799PMID: 29922710
