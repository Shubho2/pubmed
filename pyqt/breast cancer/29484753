[Epub ahead of print]The long non-coding RNA SPRY4-IT1: An emerging player in tumorigenesis andosteosarcoma.Li Z(1), Shen J(1), Chan MTV(2), Wu WKK(2)(3).Author information: (1)Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing,China.(2)Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, The Chinese University of HongKong, Hong Kong, China.(3)State Key Laboratory of Digestive Disease, LKS Institute of Health Sciences,The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.Accumulating evidence from genome-wide analysis and functional studies has begun to unveil the important role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cancerdevelopment. The lncRNA SPRY4-IT1 is derived from an intron of SPRY4 gene and wasoriginally reported to be upregulated in melanoma in which it functioned as anoncogene. Since this discovery, an increasing number of studies have investigatedthe expression and function of SPRY4-IT1 in human cancers. Aberrant expression ofSPRY4-IT1 has now been documented in different cancer types, includingosteosarcoma, breast, renal, oesophageal and prostate cancers. However, itsderegulation and function in lung and gastric cancers remain controversial.Pertinent to clinical practice, SPRY4-IT1 expression has been shown to predictsurvival of cancer patients. In this review, we summarize recent evidenceconcerning SPRY4-IT1 deregulation and the associated mechanisms in human cancers.We also discuss the potential clinical utilization of this lncRNA as a diagnosticand prognostic biomarker for cancer patients.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/cpr.12446 PMID: 29484753
