Triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 10-20% of all cases of breastcarcinoma and is characterized by the low expression of progesterone receptor(PR), estrogen receptor (ER), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2). Consequently, convenient treatments used for MBC that target thesereceptors are not effective for TNBC which therefore requires special treatmentapproaches. This review discusses the occurrence of MBC, the prognosis andpredictive biomarkers of MBC, and focuses on the novel advanced tactics fortreatment of MBC and TNBC. Nanotechnology-based combinatorial approach for thesuppression of EGFR by siRNA and gifitinib is described.DOI: 10.1007/s13346-018-0551-3 PMID: 29978332
