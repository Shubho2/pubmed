Adoptive transfer of autologous lymphocytes that specificallytarget proteins encoded by somatically mutated genes has mediated substantialobjective clinical regressions in patients with metastatic bile duct, colon andcervical cancers8-11. We present a patient with chemorefractory hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer who was treated with tumor-infiltratinglymphocytes (TILs) reactive against mutant versions of four proteins-SLC3A2,KIAA0368, CADPS2 and CTSB. Adoptive transfer of these mutant-protein-specificTILs in conjunction with interleukin (IL)-2 and checkpoint blockade mediated the complete durable regression of metastatic breast cancer, which is now ongoing for>22 months, and it represents a new immunotherapy approach for the treatment ofthese patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41591-018-0040-8 PMID: 29867227
