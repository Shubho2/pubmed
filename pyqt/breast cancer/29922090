Due to its features oncomputed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that are atypical, EMH in tumor patients might easily be misdiagnosed as metastasis leading to theimproper TNM staging and inappropriate therapy. Here, we reported the first case of pleural EMH occurring in a patient with esophageal carcinoma whose pleurallesion was first diagnosed as metastasis and confirmed EMH after the needlebiopsy. In addition, a retrospective review was conducted by analyzing patientspresented with EMH with malignant solid tumors from PubMed and Medline databases.A total of 42 solid tumor patients with EMH were enrolled, and breast cancer was the most common (n=13, 31.0%), followed by renal carcinoma (n=7, 16.7%) and lung cancer (n=6, 14.3%). A wide variety of body sites may be affected by EMH inmalignant solid tumor patients, of which the lymph nodes (n=8, 19.0%) and liver(n=7, 16.7%) were the most common, followed by the kidney (n=6, 14.3%). Allpatients were diagnosed with EMH by excision, biopsy, or autopsy. Treatmentstrategies for EMH included surgery (n=25, 59.5%), hydroxyurea (n=1, 2.4%), andblood transfusions (n=2, 4.8%); a further 14 patients (33.3%) were subjected toclinical observation without intervention. Of the patients for whom outcome wasreported, 10 patients maintained a good performance status (23.8%) and a further six patients died from the malignant tumor. This was the first study to summarizethe presentations of EMH in malignant solid tumors, and our findings mightprovide some useful guidance for clinical practice, especially for treatingpatients harboring nonresponse lesions during the antitumor treatment.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S161746 PMCID: PMC5997179PMID: 29922090
