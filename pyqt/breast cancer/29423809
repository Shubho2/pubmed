While the varied landscapes of mutations driving common cancertypes such as lung, breast, and colorectal cancer have been comprehensivelycharted, the genetic underpinnings of many rare cancers remain poorly defined.Study of rare cancers faces unique methodological challenges, but collaborativeenterprises that incorporate next generation sequencing, reach across disciplines(i.e., pathology, genetic epidemiology, genomics, functional biology, andpreclinical modeling), engage advocacy groups, tumor registries, and clinicalspecialists are adding increasing resolution to the genomic landscapes of rarecancers. Here we describe the approaches and methods used to identify SMARCA4mutations, which drive development of the rare ovarian cancer, small cellcarcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT), and point to the broaderrelevance of this paradigm for future research in rare cancers.DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4939-7471-9_20 PMID: 29423809
