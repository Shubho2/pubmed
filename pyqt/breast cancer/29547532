Estimatesindicate a nearly 40% breast cancer mortality reduction when screening womenannually starting at age 40. Although mammography is well known to be a powerful screening tool in the detection of early breast cancer, it is imperfect,particularly for women with dense breasts. In women with dense breast tissue, thesensitivity of mammography is reduced. Additionally, women with dense breastshave an increased risk of developing breast cancer while mammography has a lower sensitivity. Screening ultrasound, both handheld and automated, is effective indetecting mammographically occult cancer in women with dense tissue. Studies haveshown that ultrasound significantly increases detection of clinically important, small, largely invasive, node-negative cancers. The purpose of this reviewarticle is to summarize the literature to date regarding screening breastultrasound, emphasizing differences in cancer detection in high risk andintermediate risk women, and to discuss practical ways to implement screeningultrasound in clinical practice, including automated whole breast ultrasound, as a viable solution to the increasing need for additional screening.DOI: 10.3390/diagnostics8010020 PMCID: PMC5872003PMID: 29547532
