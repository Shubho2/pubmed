Becauseof this rarity, only a small number of studies have been published about thedisease; diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are not well-described. Our work hasbeen reported in line with the SCARE criteria.PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a 20-year-old female with primary breastleiomyosarcoma who despite mastectomy, developed lung metastases three yearslater.DISCUSSION: We discuss the rarity of breast leiomyosarcoma and risk of metastaticdisease even with treatment. We review the literature and provide an outline ofavailable data to shed light on the best strategies to manage this aggressivedisease.CONCLUSION: Physicians and surgeons treating breast leiomyosarcoma must bevigilant of potential lung metastases in order to optimize short- and long-termoncologic outcomes.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
