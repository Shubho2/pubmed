Our objective was to assess thedifferent treatment options for menopausal hormone therapy and the risk of breastcancer.Patients and methods: This Swedish prospective nationwide cohort study includedall women who received â‰¥1 hormone therapy prescription during the study period2005-2012 (290,186 ever-users), group-level matched (1:3) to 870,165 never-users;respectively 6,376 (2.2%) and 18,754 (2.2%) developed breast cancer. Hormonetherapy, ascertained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, was subdivided byestrogen and progestogen formulation types, regimens (continuous vs. sequential) and modes of administration (oral vs. transdermal). The risk of invasive breastcancer was presented as adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.Results: Current use of estrogen-only therapy was associated with a slight excessbreast cancer risk (odds ratio=1.08 (1.02-1.14)). The risk for current estrogenplus progestogen therapy was higher (odds ratio=1.77 (1.69-1.85)) and increasedwith higher age at initiation (odds ratio=3.59 (3.30-3.91) in women 70+ years).In contrast, past use was associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Currentcontinuous estrogen/progestin use was associated with higher risk (oddsratio=2.18 (1.99-2.40) for progesterone-derived; odds ratio=2.66 (2.49-2.84) for testosterone-derived) than sequential use (odds ratio=1.37 (0.97-1.92)) forprogesterone-derived; odds ratio=1.12 (0.96-1.30) for testosterone-derived). The odds ratio for current use was 1.12 (1.04-1.20) for estradiol, 0.76 (0.69-0.84)for estriol, 4.47 (2.67-7.48) for conjugated estrogens, and 1.68 (1.51-1.87) for tibolone. Oral and cutaneous hormone therapy showed similar associations.Conclusion: Different hormone therapy regimens have profoundly different effects on breast cancer risk. Because of registry limitations some confounders could notbe assessed. This knowledge may guide clinical decision-making when hormonetherapy is considered.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy212 PMID: 29917061
