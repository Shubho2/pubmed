[Epub ahead ofprint]Relationships Between Weight Change and Physical and Psychological Distress inEarly-Stage Breast Cancer Survivors.Vance V(1), Mourtzakis M, Hanning R.Author information: (1)Author Affiliations: Department of Health Sciences, Wilfrid LaurierUniversity, Waterloo (Dr Vance); and Department of Kinesiology (Dr Mourtzakis)and School of Public Health and Health Systems (Dr Hanning), University ofWaterloo, Ontario, Canada.BACKGROUND: Weight gain and unfavorable changes in body composition are common ina growing population of breast cancer survivors, but the etiology of thesechanges is poorly understood.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate relationships between weight change and symptoms of physical and psychological distress in the first 12 monthsof completing treatment in women who had completed treatment for breast cancer.METHODS: Physical distress and psychological distress were assessed using theRotterdam Symptom Checklist, the Distress Thermometer, and the Fatigue SymptomInventory.RESULTS: Weight change in 28 women since the completion of treatment (mean, 6.4 ±4.4 months) ranged from -6.0 kg to +5.2 kg (mean, -0.4 ± 3.2), with 6 womengaining and 7 women losing an average of 3.5 ± 1.0 and 5.1 ± 0.8 kg,respectively. Rotterdam mean scores for physical (17.5 ± 9.0) and psychologicaldistress (27.1 ± 16.9) were similar to previous findings for patients withearly-stage breast cancer in active treatment and appear to be markedly higherthan distress levels previously reported in cancer-free adults. Distress levels, based on the Distress Thermometer, were moderate to severe in 35% of women.Fatigue was common and associated with interference in daily living for somewomen. Fatigue duration was negatively correlated with weight change (P = -0.46, P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of physical and psychological distress persist for somewomen in the first year after completing treatment and may associate with weight change.IMPLICATIONS: These findings underscore a need for ongoing assessment andsupportive care across the breast cancer trajectory and may guide dietarycounseling aimed at promoting healthy body weight and overall health in earlysurvivorship.DOI: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000612 PMID: 29847347
