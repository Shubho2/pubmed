The diagnosticperformances of BI-RADS, elastography and BI-RADS plus elastography wereevaluated, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve(AUROC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.RESULTS: Pathologically, there were forty-eight malignant and sixty-two benignbreast lesions in the final analysis. The AUCs for CSE and ARFI induced SE aresimilar (CSE, 0.807; ARFI induced SE, 0.846; p > 0.05), however, the specificity of the latter method was significantly higher than that of CSE (83.9% vs. 58.1%, p = 0.004) in differentiating breast lesions. The accuracy and specificity ofBI-RADS plus ARFI induced SE (84.5%, 80.6%, respectively) were significantlyhigher than BI-RADS alone (73.6%, 54.8%, respectively) and BI-RADS plusconventional SE (72.7%, 56.5%, respectively), respectively (p < 0.05) withoutloss of sensitivity.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that BI-RADS plus ARFI induced SE had a betterdiagnostic performance in the diagnosis of breast lesions in comparison withBI-RADS alone or BI-RADS plus CSE.DOI: 10.3233/CH-170364 PMID: 29660916
