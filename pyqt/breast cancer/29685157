Emerging studies suggestthat the malignant progress of BC cells is influenced by the cross talk betweenmicroRNAs (miRNAs) and ER-α signaling. However, the mechanism and functionallinkage between estrogen and miRNAs remain unclear.METHODS: The expression levels of miR-196a and SPRED1 in BC were tested byqRT-PCR in 46 paired BC and adjacent tissues and by the GEO datasets. The role ofmiR-196a in estrogen-induced BC development was examined by CCK-8 assay, woundhealing assay, Matrigel invasion assay and tumorigenicity assay in nude mice. Thebinding site of ER-α in miR-196a promoter region was analyzed by ChIP-seq, ChIPassay and luciferase reporter assay. The potential targets of miR-196a in BCcells were explored using the luciferase reporter assay and western blotanalysis, and the correlation between miR-196a and SPRED1 was analyzed bySpearman's correlation analysis in BC specimens and GEO dataset. TCGA BRCA datawas used to characterize the ESR1 signatures according to MSigDB gene set.RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-196a were higher in ER-positive (ER+)breast tumors compared to ER-negative (ER-) tumor tissue samples. Besides,miR-196a was involved in estrogen-induced BC cell proliferation, migration andinvasion. Notably, the up-regulation of miR-196a was mediated by a directinteraction with estrogen receptor α (ER-α) but not estrogen receptor β (ER-β) inits promoter region, and miR-196a expression levels were positively correlated toER-α signature scores. Furthermore, SPRED1 was a new direct target of miR-196awhich participated in miR-196a-promoted BC development and was suppressed byligand-activated ER-α signal pathway. Finally, forced expression of miR-196ainduced tumor growth of MCF7 cells, while inhibition of miR-196a significantlysuppressed the tumor progress in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the identification of estrogen/miR-196a/SPRED1 cascade willshed light on new molecular mechanism of estrogen signaling in BC development andtherapy.DOI: 10.1186/s12943-018-0830-0 PMCID: PMC5914046PMID: 29685157
