Its relevance in cancer biology independent from drug efflux remains largely elusive. This study aimed atelucidating the biological relevance and regulatory mechanisms of BCRP/ABCG2 inclear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and disease progression. Two independent ccRCC-cohorts (cohort-1 (KIRC/TCGA): n=453, cohort-2: n=64) were investigated to elucidate BCRP/ABCG2 mRNA and protein expression and their association withsurvival. The impact of BCRP/ABCG2 on response to sunitinib treatment wasinvestigated in two independent sunitinib-treated ccRCC-cohorts based on mRNAlevels. Moreover, underlying regulatory mechanisms for interindividualvariability of BCRP/ABCG2 expression were systematically assessed. Owing toredundant functional properties, mRNA and protein expression of the multidrugresistance protein MDR1/ABCB1 were additionally evaluated in these cohorts. Inindependent ccRCC-cohorts, low BCRP/ABCG2 and MDR1/ABCB1 mRNA and proteinexpression were associated with severity (e.g. tumor stage) of ccRCC and poorcancer-specific survival. BCRP/ABCG2 and MDR1/ABCB1 mRNA expression were linkedto decreased progression-free survival following sunitinib treatment. Germlineand somatic variants influenced interindividual variability of BCRP/ABCG2expression only moderately. miR-212-3p and miR-132-3p were identified to regulateBCRP/ABCG2 posttranscriptionally by interaction with the ABCG2 3'UTR as confirmedthrough reporter gene assays in RCC cell lines. In summary, BCRP/ABCG2 expressionin ccRCC underlies considerable interindividual variability with impact onpatient survival and response to sunitinib treatment. While germline or somaticgenetic variants and DNA methylation cannot explain aberrant BCRP/ABCG2expression, miR-212-3p and miR-132-3p were identified to contribute toposttranscriptional regulation of BCRP/ABCG2.
