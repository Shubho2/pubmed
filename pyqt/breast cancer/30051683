Email: nats.agrawal@gmail.comObjective: Breast carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor and the leadingcause of carcinoma deaths in women. Its etiology is multifactorial, implicatingreproductive factors, hormonal imbalances and genetic predispositions. Studieshave shown that Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an important role in thecarcinogenesis and increased expression has been regarded as a poor prognosticfactor. The objective of our study is 1. To study COX-2 expression in normalbreast tissue, DCIS and invasive breast cancer. 2. To determine COX-2 expression with clinicopathological prognostic parameters. Methods: Radical mastectomyspecimens were studied for COX-2 expression by immunohistochemistry in 50patients diagnosed as breast carcinoma. COX-2 expression is quantified as IHSScore and separately calculated for normal breast epithelium near the tumor, DCISand invasive areas. Relationship between COX-2 expression with variousclinicopathological parameters was evaluated. Result: The results of our studysuggest an association of the expression of COX-2 to the factors associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, such as larger tumor size, positive lymph nodestatus, higher T stage and N stage and lymphovascular invasion. There was ahigher COX-2 expression in the DCIS component as compared to the invasive ductal carcinoma component and the adjoining breast epithelium. Conclusion: Our studyestablished the role of COX-2 in carcinogenesis and its association with adverse prognostic factors.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.7.1971 PMID: 30051683
