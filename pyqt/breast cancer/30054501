However, phenotyping is difficult, and it is often treated as anafterthought in these studies because of the expense involved. Electronic health records (EHRs) may provide higher fidelity phenotypes for genomic research thanother sources such as administrative data. We used whole genome associationmodels to evaluate different EHR and administrative data-based phenotypingmethods in a cohort of 16,858 Caucasian subjects for type 1 diabetes mellitus,type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease and breast cancer. For eachdisease, we trained and evaluated polygenic models using three differentphenotype definitions: phenotypes derived from billing data, the clinical problemlist, or a curated phenotyping algorithm. We observed that for these diseases,the curated phenotype outperformed the problem list, and the problem listoutperformed administrative billing data. This suggests that using advancedEHR-derived phenotypes can further increase the power of genome-wide association studies.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29634-w PMCID: PMC6063939PMID: 30054501
