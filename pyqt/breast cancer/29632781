The main limitation of this flap is the smallvolume provided. To improve the reconstructed breast volume, the LD flap isusually combined with a breast implant. Recently, fat grafting to the LD flap wasdescribed to maximize flap volume and obtain a totally autologous breastreconstruction. We report our experience with hybrid breast reconstruction using both breast implants and fat-enriched latissimus dorsi (FELD) flaps.Methods: Between 2013 and 2016, 74 patients underwent breast reconstruction with FELD flaps only or FELD flaps combined with a breast implant. The LD flap washarvested as previously described. Donor sites for fat harvesting were chosenaccording to each patient's natural fat distribution. Fat was harvested,centrifuged, and injected into the LD flap. After fat grafting, breast sizerswere employed to determine the final breast volume when the addition of animplant was indicated.Results: Good cosmetic outcomes were achieved in all cases, with a mean follow-upof 2.1 years. No patients had cancer reoccurrences. Four patients experienced aseroma of the LD donor site, 1 had a breast hematoma, and 1 developed Baker gradeIII capsular contracture. One year postoperatively, a clinically relevant area offat necrosis was observed in 1 patient and was surgically treated. Additional fatgrafting sessions were required in 3 cases.Conclusion: In elected cases, a FELD flap alone or in combination with a smallimplant is a valuable technique for breast reconstruction surgery.DOI: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000001602 PMCID: PMC5889461PMID: 29632781
