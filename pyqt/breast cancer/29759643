The role of ONC in the treatment of DCIS has notbeen elucidated yet: no case-control study has yet been published on the issueand no long-term oncologic results are reported.METHODS: Using the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) institutional breastcancer data base we investigated the oncologic safety of ONC for DCIS comparing aconsecutive series of 44 patients who have underwent ONC followed by externalirradiation for DCIS (Group A-study group) with 375 patients who receivedconservation alone followed by external irradiation for DCIS (Group B controlgroup) in the same period. We excluded patients presenting with secondary tumors or local relapses and those requiring re-excision or completion mastectomy forpositive margins. Primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) andipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) within the study group and comparison with the control group.RESULTS: Events rates and death rates were similar in the two groups. The averageannual rate of invasive IBTR in group A and B was 1.6% and 1.0% respectively. No difference in the rate of lymphnode metastasis, distant metastasis, contralateralbreast cancer, other primary cancer or death was observed across the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the safety of ONC and irradiation for themanagement of DCIS extending the indications for conservation in DCIS patientsotherwise treated with mastectomy. It provides the best available evidencesupporting ONC as a valid treatment option for the management of DCIS.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and theEuropean Society of Surgical Oncology.
