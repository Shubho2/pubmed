China.Background: The emergence of two-dimensional MXenes has spurred their versatileapplications in broad fields, but the exploring of novel MXene-based familymembers and their potential applications in theranostic nanomedicine (concurrent diagnostic imaging and therapy) have been rarely explored. In this work, wereport the construction of a novel superparamagnetic MXene-based theranosticnanoplatform for efficient breast-cancer theranostics, which was based onintriguing tantalum carbide (Ta4C3) MXene and its further rationalsurface-superparamagnetic iron-oxide functionalization (Ta4C3-IONP-SPs composite MXenes) for efficient breast-cancer theranostic. Methods: The fabrication ofultrathin Ta4C3 nanosheets was based on an exfoliation strategy andsuperparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were in-situ grown onto the surface ofTa4C3 MXene according to the redox reaction of MXene. Ta4C3-IONP MXenes weremodified with soybean phospholipid (SP) to guarantee high stability inphysiological conditions. The photothermal therapy, contrast-enhanced CT,T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and the high biocompatibility of thesecomposite nanosheets have also been evaluated in vitro at cellular level and invivo on mice breast tumor allograft tumor model. Results: The Ta component ofTa4C3-IONP-SPs exhibits high performance for contrast-enhanced CT imaging becauseof its high atomic number and high X-ray attenuation coefficient, and theintegrated superparamagnetic IONPs act as excellent contrast agents forT2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Especially, these Ta4C3-IONP-SPscomposite nanosheets with high photothermal-conversion efficiency (Î·: 32.5%) has achieved complete tumor eradication without reoccurrence, verifying their highly efficient breast-tumor photo-ablation performance. Conclusion: This work not onlysignificantly broadens the biomedical applications of MXene-based nanoplatforms(Ta4C3 MXene) by exploring their novel family members and furtherfunctionalization strategies (magnetic functionalization in this work), but also provides a novel and efficient theranostic nanoplatform for efficientbreast-cancer theranostics.DOI: 10.7150/thno.23369 PMCID: PMC5858173PMID: 29556347
