Purpose The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of using anautomated standard three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) device fused withstandard mammography for the first time in breast cancer patients. Material andMethods Digital mammograms and 3D automated US images were obtained in 23patients with highly suspicious breast lesions. A recently developed fusionmachine consisting of an ABVS 3D US transducer from an Acuson S2000 machine and aconventional Mammomat Inspiration device (both Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen,Germany) were used for the purpose. The feasibility of the examinations, imaging coverage, and patients' experience of the procedure were examined. Results In 15 out of 19 patients, the region of interest (ROI) with the tumor marked in themammogram was visible on US. The examination was experienced positively by thepatients, with no unexpected pain or injury. The examination was time-saving and well tolerated. Conclusion In conclusion, we have shown initial clinicalfeasibility of an US/radiography fusion prototype with good localization andevaluation of the ROIs. The combined examination was well tolerated. Thesimultaneous evaluation with mammography and US imaging may be able to improvedetection and reduce examiner-related variability.DOI: 10.1177/0284185118762249 PMID: 29498297
