Latent classgrowth analysis revealed three posttraumatic growth trajectory patterns:distressed posttraumatic growth ( n = 5, 6.7%), illusory posttraumatic growth (n = 42, 56.0%), and constructive posttraumatic growth ( n = 28, 37.3%). Womenwith more frequent use of helplessness-hopelessness coping and lower depressionlevels at Time 1 were more likely to display an illusory than a constructiveposttraumatic growth trajectory pattern. Illusory posttraumatic growth mightrepresent a form of coping rather than authentic positive changes. Researchersand clinicians should understand different patterns of posttraumatic growth.DOI: 10.1177/1359105318793199 PMID: 30080097
