In thepresent study, the association between BAT activity, detected by FDG-positronemission tomography (PET), and the clinicopathological features of patients with breast cancer was investigated. The cases of 156 consecutive patients with breastcancer who underwent FDG-PET preoperatively were analyzed. The distribution andintensity of atypical FDG uptake in the neck and/or supraclavicular region wasreviewed. The intensity was graded as follows: 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3,intense. Among the 156 patients, 70 (44.9%) exhibited grade 1 intensity, 65(41.7%) exhibited grade 2 intensity and 21 (13.5%) exhibited grade 3 intensity.The intensity of FDG was significantly associated with human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (HER2) expression and progesterone expression. Among the 156patients, 6 (3.8%) had recurrent disease. Multivariate analysis revealed thatshowing a low grade of atypical FDG uptake was the only independent risk factorof short-term recurrence, and none of the patients with recurrent disease hadatypical FDG uptake that may reflect the activation of BAT. These resultsindicated that the presence of BAT is associated with HER2 expression and theabsence of BAT may be a prognostic factor for breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.6768 PMCID: PMC5773005PMID: 29422959
