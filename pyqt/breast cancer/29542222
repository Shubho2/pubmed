[Epub ahead of print]Mindfulness, cognitive behavioural and behaviour-based therapy for natural andtreatment-induced menopausal symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis.van Driel CM(1)(2), Stuursma A(1)(2), Schroevers MJ(3), Mourits MJ(1), de BockGH(2).Author information: (1)Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, University Medical Centre Groningen,Groningen, the Netherlands.(2)Department of Epidemiology, University Medical Centre Groningen, Groningen,the Netherlands.(3)Department of Health Psychology, University Medical Centre Groningen,Groningen, the Netherlands.BACKGROUND: During menopause women experience vasomotor and psychosexual symptomsthat cannot entirely be alleviated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT).Besides, HRT is contraindicated after breast cancer.OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence on the effectiveness of psychologicalinterventions in reducing symptoms associated with menopause in natural ortreatment-induced menopausal women.SEARCH STRATEGY: Medline/Pubmed, PsycINFO, EMBASE and AMED were searched untilJune 2017.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning natural ortreatment-induced menopause, investigating mindfulness or(cognitive-)behaviour-based therapy were selected. Main outcomes were frequencyof hot flushes, hot flush bother experienced, other menopausal symptoms andsexual functioning.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate thestandardised mean difference (SMD).MAIN RESULTS: Twelve RCTs were included. Short-term (<20 weeks) effects ofpsychological interventions in comparison to no treatment or control wereobserved for hot flush bother (SMD -0.54, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.35, P < 0.001, I2 = 18%) and menopausal symptoms (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.15, P < 0.001, I2  = 0%). Medium-term (≥20 weeks) effects were observed for hot flush bother (SMD-0.38, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.18, P < 0.001, I2  = 16%). [Correction added on 9 July 2018, after first online publication: there were miscalculations of the mean end point scores for hot flush bother and these have been corrected in the preceding two sentences.] In the subgroup treatment-induced menopause, consisting ofexclusively breast cancer populations, as well as in the subgroup naturalmenopause, hot flush bother was reduced by psychological interventions. Too fewstudies reported on sexual functioning to perform a meta-analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Psychological interventions reduced hot flush bother in the shortand medium-term and menopausal symptoms in the short-term. These results areespecially relevant for breast cancer survivors in whom HRT is contraindicated.There was a lack of studies reporting on the influence on sexual functioning.TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Systematic review: psychological interventions reduce bother by hot flushes in the short- and medium-term.© 2018 The Authors.
