The mechanism of lymphomagenesis is unknown. Recently, a bacterialbiofilm containing gram-negative bacilli was discovered on the surface of breast implants associated with ALCL. We and others have described overexpression of theproto-oncogene JUNB and mutations of JAK1/2, TP53 and STAT3 in BIA-ALCL. Here we report that BIA-ALCL cell lines and anaplastic lymphoma cells in clinicalspecimens produce IL-13, the signature cytokine of allergic inflammation.Supporting the link of BIA-ALCL to allergic inflammation, lymphoma cells wereoften surrounded by eosinophils and mast cells, features typically absent insystemic ALCL. Because of the link of IL-13 to allergy, we looked for IgE andfound it decorating the surface of mast cells and antigen-presenting folliculardendritic cells in capsules and lymph nodes infiltrated by anaplastic lymphomacells, but not uninvolved capsules. Plasma cells within capsules and regionallymph nodes were identified as a possible source of IgE. Together, these findingssuggest the hypothesis that an amplified immune response with features of achronic allergic reaction in a susceptible patient underlies the pathogenesis of BIA-ALCL.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
