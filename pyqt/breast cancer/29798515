Itrelates with cancerous proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis.miRNA-29c directly inhibits the transcription of the target gene encoding proteinand down regulates the expression of the target gene. miRNA-29c inhibits tumorcells infinite proliferation and promotes apoptosis by regulating the signalpathways, oncogene, and cell cycle. miRNA-29c can inhibit the invasion andmetastasis of tumor cells by regulating different target genes, signal pathwaysand mediating epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In tumor tissues, the lowerexpression of miRNA-29c, the higher clinical stage,and the poorer prognosis, soit can be used as an indicator of early diagnosis and prognosis. miRNA-29c isalso closely related to head and neck cancer. Therefore, enhancement of theexpression of miRNA-29c in tumor cells is expected to be a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer. Selective COX2 inhibitors and demethylated drugs cansignificantly increase the expression of miRNA-29c. miRNA-29c can be a new tumor biomarker and drug or gene therapeutic target.DOI: 10.13201/j.issn.1001-1781.2018.04.019 PMID: 29798515
