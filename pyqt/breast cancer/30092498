At 64 months median follow-up, 697 (6.8%) had further DCIS orinvasive breast cancer after BCS (7.8%) or mastectomy (4.5%) (p < 0.001). Breast radiotherapy (RT) after BCS (4363/7007; 62.3%) was associated with a 3.1%absolute reduction in ipsilateral recurrent DCIS or invasive breast cancer (noRT: 7.2% versus RT: 4.1% [p < 0.001]) and a 1.9% absolute reduction foripsilateral invasive breast recurrence (no RT: 3.8% versus RT: 1.9% [p < 0.001]),independent of the excision margin width or size of DCIS. Women without RT after BCS had more ipsilateral breast recurrences (p < 0.001) when the radial excision margin was <2 mm. Adjuvant endocrine therapy (1208/9938; 12%) was associated witha reduction in any ipsilateral recurrence, whether RT was received (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41-0.80) or not (HR 0.68; 95% CI0.51-0.91) after BCS. Women who developed invasive breast recurrence had a worse survival than those with recurrent DCIS (p < 0.001). Among 321 (3.2%) who died,only 46 deaths were attributed to invasive breast cancer.CONCLUSION: Recurrent DCIS or invasive cancer is uncommon after screen-detectedDCIS. Both RT and endocrine therapy were associated with a reduction in furtherevents but not with breast cancer mortality within 5 years of diagnosis. Further research to identify biomarkers of recurrence risk, particularly as invasivedisease, is indicated.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.DOI: 10.1016/j.ejca.2018.06.027 PMID: 30092498
