We aimed to evaluate the expression of hormone and insulin-relatedproteins within or related to the PI3K and MAPK pathway in breast tumors of womenwith or without diabetes mellitus, treated with or without insulin (analogues).METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on tumor tissue of 312 women withinvasive breast cancer, with or without pre-existing diabetes mellitus, diagnosedin 2000-2010, who were randomly selected from a Danish breast cancer cohort.Women with diabetes were 2:1 frequency matched by year of birth and age at breastcancer diagnosis to those without diabetes. Tumor Microarrays were successfullystained for p-ER, EGFR, p-ERK1/2, p-mTOR, and IGF1R, and scored by a breastpathologist. Associations of expression of these proteins with diabetes, insulin treatment (human insulin and insulin analogues) and other diabetes medicationwere evaluated by multivariable logistic regression adjusting for menopause andBMI; effect modification by menopausal status, BMI, and ER status was assessedusing interactions terms.RESULTS: We found no significant differences in expression of any of the proteinsin breast tumors of women with (n = 211) and without diabetes (n = 101). Amongwomen with diabetes, insulin use (n = 53) was significantly associated withhigher tumor protein expression of IGF1R (OR = 2.36; 95%CI:1.02-5.52; p = 0.04)and p-mTOR (OR = 2.35; 95%CI:1.13-4.88; p = 0.02), especially among women treatedwith insulin analogues. Menopause seemed to modified the association betweeninsulin and IGF1R expression (p = 0.07); the difference in IGF1R expression wasonly observed in tumors of premenopausal women (OR = 5.10; 95%CI:1.36-19.14;p = 0.02). We found no associations between other types of diabetes medication,such as metformin, and protein expression of the five proteins evaluated.CONCLUSIONS: In our study, breast tumors of women with pre-existing diabetes did not show an altered expression of selected PI3K/MAPK pathway-related proteins. Weobserved an association between insulin treatment and increased p-mTOR and IGF1R expression of breast tumors, especially in premenopausal women. This observation,if confirmed, might be clinically relevant since the use of IGF1R and mTORinhibitors are currently investigated in clinical trials.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4072-8 PMID: 29486734
