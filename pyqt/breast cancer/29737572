Little is known about HSPC159 expression and functionin breast cancer. Herein we showed that HSPC159 was aberrantly expressed in both breast cancer cell lines and tumor tissues and that its expression was associatedwith poor prognosis of breast cancer patients. Using gain- and loss-of-functionmethods we found that HSPC159 enhanced breast cancer cell proliferation andmetastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HSPC159 was found to induceepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the F-actin polymerization process ofbreast cancer cells. Moreover, HSPC159 promoted proliferation, migration andinvasion through activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in breast cancer. Inconclusion, our findings showed that HSPC159 contributed to breast cancerprogression through the PI3K/Akt pathway and might serve as a potentialtherapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.© 2018 The Authors.
