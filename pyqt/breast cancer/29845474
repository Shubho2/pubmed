However, the roleof syntenin1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), especially in suppressionof antitumour immune response, remains unknown.METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred TNBC tissues were obtained after radicalresection and used for analysis. High syntenin1 expression was associated withincreased tumour size (r = 0.421, P < 0.001), presence of lymph node metastasis(r = 0.221, P = 0.044) and poor overall survival (P = 0.01) and recurrence-freesurvival (P = 0.007). Syntenin1 overexpression significantly promoted 4T1 tumour growth and lung metastasis in BALB/c mice by affecting CD8+ T cells. Western blotand flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that syntenin1 induced CD8+ T cellapoptosis in vitro and in vivo through upregulating PD-L1. Western blotdemonstrated that syntenin1 upregulated PD-L1 expression by inducing Tyr705 stat3phosphorylation, which was further confirmed by stat3 inhibition study. Thecorrelation between syntenin1 and PD-L1 was further confirmed using tumourtissues derived from patients with TNBC (r = 0.509, P < 0.001). Efficacy studies indicated that 4T1-scramble tumour benefitted from anti-PD-L1 therapy(P < 0.001); however, 4T1-syntenin1-KD demonstrated no response to anti-PD-L1treatment (P = 0.076).CONCLUSIONS: Syntenin1 exhibits a profound function in mediating T cellsapoptosis by upregulating PD-L1 and thus could be used as a prognostic biomarker of TNBC. Tumoural syntenin1 expression corelated with anti-PD-L1 treatmentefficacy. Targeting syntenin1-mediated T-cell suppression could be a potentialstrategy for improving the prognosis of patients with TNBC.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4833-8 PMID: 29845474
