Nowadays,in vivo dosimetry procedures for photon beams are based on the use of theelectronic portal imaging device and dedicated software to elaborate electronicportal imaging device images.METHODS: In total, 8474 in vivo dosimetry tests were carried out for 386 patientstreated with 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, intensity-modulatedradiotherapy, and volumetric modulated arc therapy techniques, using theSOFTDISO. SOFTDISO is a dedicated software that uses electronic portal imagingdevice images in order to (1) calculate the R index, that is, the ratio betweendaily reconstructed dose and the planned one at isocenter and (2) perform aγ-like analysis between the signals, S, of a reference electronic portal imaging device image and that obtained in a daily fraction. It supplies 2 indexes, thepercentage γ% of points with γ < 1 and the mean γ value, γmean. In γ-likeanalysis, the pass criteria for the signals agreement ΔS% and distance toagreement Δd have been selected based on the clinical experience and technologyused. The adopted tolerance levels for the 3 indexes were fixed in 0.95 ≤ R ≤1.05, γ% ≥ 90%, and γmean ≤ 0.5.RESULTS: The results of R ratio, γ-like, and a visual inspection of these datareported on a monitor screen permitted to individuate 2 classes of errors (1)class 1 that included errors due to inadequate standard quality controls and (2) class 2, due to patient morphological changes. Depending on the technique andanatomical site, a maximum of 18% of tests had at least 1 index out of tolerance;once removed the causes of class-1 errors, almost all patients (except patientswith 4 lung and 2 breast cancer treated with 3-dimensional conformalradiotherapy) presented mean indexes values ([Formula: see text], [Formula: seetext]%, and [Formula: see text] ) within tolerance at the end of treatmentcourse. Class-2 errors were found in some patients.CONCLUSIONS: The in vivo dosimetry procedure with SOFTDISO resulted easilyimplementable, able to individuate errors with a limited workload.DOI: 10.1177/1533033818779201 PMCID: PMC5992805PMID: 29871570
