However, a direct link between markers of inflammation, collagen organization, and patientoutcome has yet to be established. A tumor microarray of 371 invasive breastcarcinoma biopsy specimens was analyzed for expression of inflammatory markers,including cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), macrophages, and several collagen features inthe tumor nest (TN) or the tumor-associated stroma (TS). The tumor microarraycohort included females, aged 18 to 80 years, with a median follow-up of 8.4years. High expression of COX-2 (TN), CD68 (TS), and CD163 (TN and TS) predicted worse patient overall survival (OS). This notion was strengthened by the finding from the multivariate analysis that high numbers of CD163+ macrophages in the TS is an independent prognostic factor. Overall collagen deposition was associatedwith high stromal expression of COX-2 and CD163; however, total collagendeposition was not a predictor for OS. Conversely, local collagen density,alignment and perpendicular alignment to the tumor boundary (tumor-associatedcollagen signature-3) were predictors of OS. These results suggest that ininvasive carcinoma, the localization of inflammatory cells and aligned collagenorientation predict poor patient survival. Additional clinical studies may helpvalidate whether therapy with selective COX-2 inhibitors alters expression ofCD68 and CD163 inflammatory markers.Copyright Â© 2018 American Society for Investigative Pathology.
