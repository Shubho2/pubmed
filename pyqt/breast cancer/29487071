Three categories of individual factors identified in the literature wereused as potential explanatory factors, that is, demographic, clinical andpsychosocial.RESULTS: Descriptive statistics indicated that the vast majority of sampled womenare interested in BCST (90%). Among those, more than half of them arewilling-to-pay for such a test (57%). The regression models pointed out severalfactors associated with both outcomes (eg, age, income, family history, locus of control-powerful others) and marginal effects were used to highlight the mostimpactful factors for each outcome.CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide a proxy of the readiness of womenof the general population to use and to pay for BCST. They also offer insightsfor developing inclusive and specific strategies to foster informeddecision-making and guide the services offered by health organisationscorresponding to women's preferences and needs.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
