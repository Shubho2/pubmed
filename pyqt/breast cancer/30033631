The authors describedresponses from approximately 73% of surgeons (370 surgeons), 61% of medicaloncologists (306 medical oncologists), 67% of radiation oncologists (169radiation oncologists), and 68% of patients (2502 patients).RESULTS: Approximately one-half (50.9%) of responding medical oncologistsreported that someone in their practice often or always discusses financialburden with patients, as did 15.6% of surgeons and 43.2% of radiationoncologists. Patients indicated that financial toxicity remains common: 21.5% of white patients and 22.5% of Asian patients had to cut down spending on food, asdid 45.2% of black and 35.8% of Latina patients. Many patients desired to talk toproviders about the financial impact of cancer (15.2% of whites, 31.1% of blacks,30.3% of Latinas, and 25.4% of Asians). Unmet patient needs for engagement withphysicians about financial concerns were common. Of 945 women who worried aboutfinances, 679 (72.8%) indicated that physicians and their staff did not help. Of 523 women who desired to talk to providers regarding the impact of breast cancer on employment or finances, 283 (55.4%) reported no relevant discussion.CONCLUSIONS: Many patients report inadequate clinician engagement in themanagement of financial toxicity, even though many providers believe that theymake services available. Clinician assessment and communication regardingfinancial toxicity must improve; cure at the cost of financial ruin isunacceptable.
