Previously, we observed thationizing radiation (IR) initiates cytoplasmic translocation of BRCA1 leading tosuppression of HR-mediated DNA repair and induction of synthetic PARPi lethality in wild-type BRCA1 and HR-proficient tumor cells. The tumor suppressor p53 wasidentified as a key factor that regulates DNA damage-induced BRCA1 cytoplasmicsequestration following IR. However, the role of p53 in IR-induced PARPisensitization remains unclear. This study elucidates the role of p53 inIR-induced PARPi cytotoxicity in HR-proficient cancer cells and suggests p53status may help define a patient population that might benefit from thistreatment strategy. Sensitization to PARPi following IR was determined in vitroand in vivo utilizing human breast and glioma tumor cells carrying wild-typeBRCA1 and p53, and in associated cells in which p53 function was modified byknockdown or mutation. In breast and glioma cells with proficient HR repair,IR-induced BRCA1 cytoplasmic sequestration, HR repair inhibition, and subsequent PARPi sensitization in vitro and in vivo was dependent upon functionalp53.Implications: Implications: p53 status determines PARP inhibitorsensitization by ionizing radiation in multiple BRCA1 and HR-proficient tumortypes and may predict which patients are most likely to benefit from combination therapy.
