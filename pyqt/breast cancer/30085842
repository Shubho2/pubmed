The indications for marker placement included invasivecarcinoma (96 markers [45.1%]), ductal carcinoma in situ (41 markers [19.2%]),and high-risk lesions (71 markers [33.3%]). Localization markers were mostcommonly placed for masses (96 markers [45.1%]) and were deployed undermammographic guidance (160 markers [75.1%]) or sonographic guidance (53 markers[24.9%]). Technical success, which was defined as placement of the magneticmarker within 1 cm of the target, was achieved for 206 of 213 markers (96.7%).All 213 markers were successfully retrieved at surgery. Of 137 cases of in situor invasive carcinoma, 30 (21.9%) had tumor-positive or close surgical marginsthat required reexcision. No major or minor complications were observed duringmarker placement, intraoperatively, or postoperatively.CONCLUSION: Image-guided needle localization with magnetic markers is a safe,feasible, and effective method for localizing breast lesions. Magnetic markerlocalization has the potential to replace conventional wire needle localizationand radioactive seed needle localization for lesions that require surgicalexcision.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.18.19637 PMID: 30085842
