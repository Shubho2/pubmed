Thisstudy was conducted to evaluate the relationship between PIK3CA mutations andneoadjuvant treatment response and to analyze the clinical implications.METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database were searched for relevantstudies in September 2017. The pooled risk ratio (RR) was estimated using fixedeffects or random effects models according to heterogeneity among studies.RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 20 studies with 4392 patients. The pooled RRshowed that PIK3CA mutation is correlated to lower pathological complete response(pCR) in unselected HER2+ patients (RR = 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI]0.66-0.81), thus the predictive value of PIK3CA status may be stronger inHER2+/HR+ patients (RR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.27-0.93) and those administereddual-targeting treatment (RR = 0.55; 95% CI 0.39-0.78). In contrast with wildtype, either exon 9 (RR = 0.55; 95% CI 0.39-0.78) or exon 20 (RR = 0.71; 95% CI0.58-0.89) mutations were significantly associated with lower pCR. The predictivevalue of exon 9 mutations was not significantly greater than exon 20 mutations(RR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.51-1.13).CONCLUSION: In early breast cancer, PIK3CA mutations seem to identify HER2+patients who are less likely to reach pCR. The clinical implications of PIK3CAmutations tend to vary between exon 9 and exon 20. This mechanism should beexplored in further studies.© 2018 The Authors.
