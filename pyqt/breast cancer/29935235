Electronic address: nabilzein@hotmail.fr.PACAP has opposing roles ranging from activation to inhibition of tumor growthand PACAP agonists/antagonists could be used in tumor therapy. In this study, theeffect of PACAP stimulation on signaling pathways was investigated in MCF-7 humanadenocarcinoma breast cancer cells. Results showed that MCF-7 cells express VPAC1and VPAC2, but not PAC1, receptors. In addition, PACAP increased thephosphorylation levels of STAT1, Src and Raf within seconds, confirming theirinvolvement in early stages of PACAP signaling whereas maximal phosphorylation ofAKT, ERK and p38 was reached 10 to 20 min later. Moreover, selective inhibitionof Src or PI3K resulted in a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of ERKand AKT, but not p38, demonstrating that PACAP signaling follows Src/Raf/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways. On the other hand, selective inhibition of PLC or PKA resultedin a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of p38, but not AKT or ERK,indicating that PACAP signaling also follows the PLC and PKA/cAMP pathways.Furthermore, PACAP induced ROS through H₂O₂ production whereas pretreatment with NAC inhibitor decreased AKT and ERK phosphorylation, but not p38. Selective NOX2 inhibition affected Src/Raf/Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways, without affecting thep38/PLC/PKA pathway whereas other inhibitors (ML171, VAS2870) had no effect onPACAP induced ROS generation. On the other hand, PACAP induced calcium release,which was decreased by pretreatment with PLC inhibitor. Finally, PACAPstimulation promoted apoptosis by increasing Bax and decreasing Bcl2 expression. In conclusion, we demonstrated that PACAP signaling in MCF-7 cells follows theSrc/Raf/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways and is VPAC1 dependent in a ROS dependentmanner, whereas it follows PLC and PKA/cAMP pathways and is VPAC2 dependentthrough p38 MAP kinase activation involving calcium.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
