Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an important target for suchprecision chemotherapies because of its dismal prognosis. We analyzed mutationsin the entire coding regions of the BRCA pathway genes, expression of breastcancer 2 (BRCA2), and mutations in hotspots of 50 cancer-associated genes in 42surgically resected PDACs, and evaluated their associations withclinicopathological features. We identified 13 rare germline mutations in theBRCA pathway genes; 68 somatic mutations in KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, CDKN2A, GNAS,SMARCB1, and RB1; and 2 germline variations in MLH1. Among them, BRCA2S2148fs wasknown to be pathogenic. BRCA2R18H and BRCA2G2044V were enriched in tumor tissues.BRCA2K799R and BRCA2R2964T were novel germline variations. Patients harboringpotentially deleterious mutations in the BRCA pathway genes showed significantly better prognosis than those with benign mutations or no mutation. These resultsindicate that rare germline variations in BRCA pathway genes could be found more frequently than previously anticipated and, more importantly, potentiallydeleterious mutations of them could be a favorable prognostic factor in patients with resectable PDACs.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-26526-x PMCID: PMC5970161PMID: 29802286
