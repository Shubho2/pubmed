Acute toxicity was observed inseven patients, while the pain during following days and hematoma were seen infour patients. With a median follow-up of 24 months, late toxicity was found inone patient with fat necrosis g2 and fibrosis g2 in another patient. The overall survival (OS) and locoregional control (LC) was 100%. Disease-free survival (DFS)and distant control was 95%. Good to excellent cosmetic outcomes were noted in80% of patients and fair in 4 patients (20%).Conclusions: This is the first report in the medical literature that focuses onfeasibility and acute and chronic toxicity, with a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 20-40). The protocol is viable and convenient. However, a longerfollow-up is needed to know chronic toxicity and oncologic outcomes.DOI: 10.5114/jcb.2018.73994 PMCID: PMC5881592PMID: 29619057
