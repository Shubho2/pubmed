Due to the lack of adequatemolecular targets, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with the TNBCphenotype has been a great challenge. In a previous work, we identifiedCD90/Thy-1 as being highly expressed in the aggressive high malignancy gradeHs578T basal-like breast tumor cell line, pointing to this molecule as apromising breast tumor marker, which should be further investigated. Here, CD90expression was analyzed in human breast cancer samples and its functional rolewas investigated to better assess the oncogenic nature of CD90 in mammary cells. Quantification of CD90 expression in human breast cancer samples, by tissuemicroarray, showed that high CD90 positivity correlates with metastasis and poor patient survival in the basal-like subtype. The functional genetic approach, byoverexpression in the CD90 cDNA in a basal-like normal mammary cell line (MCF10A)and knockdown in a highly malignant cell line (Hs578T), allowed us to demonstratethat CD90 is involved with several cellular processes that lead to malignanttransformation, such as: morphological change, increased cell proliferation,invasiveness, metastasis and activation of the EGFR pathway. Therefore, ourresults reveal that CD90 is involved with malignant transformation in breastcancer cell lines and is correlated with metastasis and poor patient survival in the basal-like subtype, being considered as a promising new breast cancer target.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199254 PMCID: PMC6021101PMID: 29949609
