It is essential to develop analytical methods for accurate detection of TOPOI in biological fluids for early diagnosis of diseases. Here we show an assay for TOPOI on the basis of the target-inducedself-assembly of graphene oxide (GO) sheets ontohydroxycamptothecin-functionalized upconversion nanoparticles (HCPT-UCNPs). Thedipole-dipole coupling of HCPT-UCNPs (donor) and GO (acceptor) regulated by TOPOIenables Förster resonance energy transfer between the donor and the acceptor.Integration of minimal autofluorescence and highly specific affinity into thedeveloped nanosensor allows reliable detection of TOPOI in the nanomolar rangewith the detection limit of 0.29 nM. The detection of TOPOI in breast cancercells with recoveries from 96.3 to 103.7% shows the availability of the proposed assay in complicated samples.
