Theneutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has also been investigated for a CRPCtreatments in a few reports, however it has not been identified to be aprognostic factor for AA treatment in Japanese patients. The present study aimed to assess the association of the baseline NLR with the overall survival (OS) inCPRC patients treated by AA. The present study retrospectively reviewed a totalof 90 consecutive patients with CRPC treated with AA from 2011 to 2016 atYokohama City University Medical Center and National Cancer Center Hospital East.The primary endpoint of the study was the OS, which was defined as the survivalfrom the start of AA administration. The secondary endpoint was theprostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. PSA response was defined as a reductionin antigen levels of >50%. Complete blood cell counts were performed, and the NLRwas calculated using the neutrophil and lymphocyte counts obtained on the sameday or a few days prior to the initiation of AA therapy. The NLR cut-off pointwas determined to be 3.76 for the OS, and divided into the high NLR group of 34patients and the low NLR group of 56 patients. A PSA response was obtained in 8patients (23.5%) in the high NLR group and in 24 (42.9%) in the low NLR group.The difference of PSA response between the two groups was significant (P=0.037). Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that a high NLR [NLR â‰¥3.76; median OS: 8.4months; 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.325-10.475 months] was correlated with a risk of mortality compared with a low NLR (NLR <3.76; median OS not reached). Amultivariate analysis demonstrated that the NLR was an independent predictor for the OS (hazard ratio: 2.682; 95% CI: 1.143-6.293; P=0.023). The findings suggest that the NLR may be a useful novel biomarker for predicting the prognosis of CRPCpatients treated with AA.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2018.1573 PMCID: PMC5838297PMID: 29541468
