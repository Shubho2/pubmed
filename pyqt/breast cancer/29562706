Amino acids are essential for thesurvival of all types of cells, including tumor cells, which have an increaseddemand for nutrients to facilitate proliferation and cancer progression. Breastcancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide and is still associatedwith high mortality rates, despite improved treatment strategies. Recent studies have demonstrated that the amino acid metabolic pathway is altered in breastcancer and that amino acid transporters affect tumor growth and progression. Inbreast cancer, glutamine is one of the key nutrients, and glutamine metabolism isclosely related to the amino acid transporters. In this review, we focus on aminoacid transporters and their roles in breast cancer. We also highlight thedifferent subsets of upregulated amino acid transporters in breast cancer anddiscuss their potential applications as treatment targets, cancer imagingtracers, and drug delivery components. Glutamine metabolism as well as itsregulation and therapeutic implication in breast cancer are also discussed.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19030907 PMCID: PMC5877768PMID: 29562706
