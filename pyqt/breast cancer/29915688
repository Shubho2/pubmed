CCL7 is widely expressed in multiple cell types and can participate in anti-inflammatory responses through binding to its receptors to mediate therecruitment of immune cells. Abnormal CCL7 expression is associated with certain immune diseases. Furthermore, CCL7 plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. CCL7promotes tumor progression by supporting the formation of the tumormicroenvironment and facilitating tumor invasion and metastasis, although somestudies have suggested that CCL7 has tumor suppressor effects. In this review, wesummarize the currently available information regarding the influence of CCL7 on tumors.DOI: 10.7717/peerj.4928 PMCID: PMC6004300PMID: 29915688
