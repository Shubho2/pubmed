Thenew compounds were screened for their in vitro antitumor activity toward liver(HepG-2) and breast (MCF-7) human cancer cells using3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide MTT assay. From the results, it was found that all compounds showed dose-dependent cytotoxicactivities against both HepG-2 and MCF-7 cells. Two compounds 18o and 18a wereselected for further investigations. Cell cycle analysis of liver (HepG-2) cells treated with 18o and breast (MCF-7) cells treated with 18a showed cell cyclearrest at G2/M phase and pro-apoptotic activity as indicated by annexin V-FITCstaining.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23061249 PMID: 29882908
