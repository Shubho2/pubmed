We studied the breast tumor profile associated to the c.3481_3491del11French founder effect mutation on the BRCA1 gene to an attempt to identify anyparticularity or difference when comparing it to that related to other BRCA1mutations. Within the population who were referred to our oncogenetic clinic atthe Lorraine Oncology Institute in France and who underwent genetic testingbetween 1994 and 2012, we identified 404 women carrying a BRCA1 mutation.Interestingly, 45% (180/404) women had the germline c.3481_3491del11 mutation.These included 91 patients affected by first breast cancer. Clinical andpathologic data were retrieved from medical files. Descriptive statistics wereconducted using the SPSS software (version 20.0). For the entire cohort of 91women, the mean age was 43.64 years (SD 10.04). Tumors were identified in 37.4%of cases aged < 40 years. Estrogen receptor status and progesterone receptorstatus were reported to 67 patients. Seventy-four percent were ER negative.Hormonal receptors status was negative in 68.6% of tumors. HER2 status wasavailable for 32 tumors. The triple-negative subtype was found in 21 cases, whichaccounts for 65.6% of the patients. High tumor grade was found in 81% of triplenegative breast cancer patients. Based on our results compared to those ofprevious international studies, we concluded that the breast cancer associated tothe c.3481_3491del11 is not different from that associated to other BRCA1mutations. A larger cohort with complete information on the breast cancerpathologic characteristics and including other BRCA1 mutations would allow us to statistically compare the breast tumor profile associated to the c.3481_3491del11to that related to other BRCA1 mutations.DOI: 10.1007/s10689-018-0079-1 PMID: 29550896
