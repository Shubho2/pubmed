Epub 2018 Feb 26.The patient's perspective on breast radiotherapy: Initial fears and expectations versus reality.Shaverdian N(1), Wang X(2), Hegde JV(1), Aledia C(1), Weidhaas JB(1), SteinbergML(1), McCloskey SA(1).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California at Los Angeles, LosAngeles, California.(2)Department of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.BACKGROUND: Although the efficacy and toxicity of breast radiotherapy (RT) hasbeen studied extensively, to the authors' knowledge little is known regarding thepatient's perspective on the modern breast RT experience. To better inform futurepatients and providers, the authors explored patient perceptions of their RTexperience.METHODS: Consecutive patients who were free of disease recurrence and who hadbeen treated between 2012 and 2016 were surveyed regarding their original fears, how short-term and long-term toxicities compared with initial expectations, andhow pretreatment beliefs concerning RT compared with the actual experience.RESULTS: A total of 502 patients were surveyed, with a response rate of 65% (327 patients). The median patient age and posttreatment follow-up was 59 years and 31months, respectively. Approximately 83% of patients (269 patients) underwentbreast conservation therapy. Although approximately 68% of patients (221patients) endorsed that they initially had little to no knowledge regarding RT,approximately 47% (152 patients) reported that they had heard frighteningstories. Approximately 2% of patients (6 patients) agreed that the negativestories they previously heard about RT were actually true. Approximately 92% ofpatients treated with breast conservation (247 patients) and 81% of patients who underwent mastectomy (47 patients) agreed with the statement "If future patients knew the real truth about RT, they would be less scared about treatment."Approximately 83% (272 patients) and 84% (274 patients), respectively, of allpatients reported the overall severity of short-term and long-term side effectsto be better than or as expected.CONCLUSIONS: Breast RT is associated with misconceptions and fears. Patients'experiences with modern breast RT appear to be superior to expectations, and the majority of patients in the current study agreed that their initial negativeimpressions were unfounded.
