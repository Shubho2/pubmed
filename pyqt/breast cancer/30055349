Electronic address: j-solassol@chu-montpellier.fr.The recent deployment of next-generation sequencing approaches in routinelaboratory analysis has considerably modified the landscape of BRCA1 and BRCA2germline alteration detection in patients with a high risk of developing breastand/or ovarian cancer. Several commercial multiplex amplicon-based panels andbioinformatics solutions are currently available. In this study, we evaluated thecombinations of several BRCA testing assays and bioinformatics solutions for the identification of single nucleotide variants, insertion/deletion variants(indels), and copy number variations (CNVs). Four assays (BRCA Tumor, BRCA HC,Ion AmpliSeq BRCA, and Access Array BRCA) and two commercial bioinformaticssolutions (the SeqNext software and the Sophia DDM platform) were tested on a setof 28 previously genotyped samples. All solutions exhibited accurate detection ofsingle nucleotide variants /indels, except for Ion AmpliSeq BRCA, which exhibiteddrop in coverage. Interestingly, for CNV analysis, the best accuracy was observedwith the Sophia DDM platform regardless of the BRCA kit used. Finally, theperformance of the most relevant combination (BRCA Tumor and Sophia DDM) wasblindly validated on an independent set of 152 samples. Altogether, our resultsemphasize the need to accurately compare and control both molecularnext-generation sequencing approaches and bioinformatics pipelines to limit thenumber of discrepant alterations and to provide a powerful tool for reliabledetection of genetic alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, notably CNVs.Copyright © 2018.
