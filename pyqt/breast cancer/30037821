The physiology of taxane neuropathy is not clear, and diverse mechanisms have been suggested, with ion channelsregulating Ca2+ homeostasis appearing good candidates. The calcium-activatedpotassium channel SK3 is encoded by the KCNN3 gene, which is characterized by alength polymorphism due to variable number of CAG repeats.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To study the influence of the polymorphism of CAG motifrepeat of KCNN3 on the development of taxane-induced neuropathy, we evaluated 176patients treated with taxanes for breast cancer. In parallel, we measured Ca2+entry using Fura2-AM dye in HEK-cells expressing short vs long CAG alleles ofKCNN3.RESULTS: In the present study, we report that in the presence of docetaxel, Ca2+ entry was significantly increased in cells expressing short vs long CAG allelesof SK3 and that a SK3-lipid-blocker inhibits this effect. We found that patients carrying a short KCNN3 allele exhibited significantly increased incidence oftaxane neuropathy compared to those carrying longer alleles.CONCLUSIONS: The clinical implication of these findings is that KCNN3polymorphism may increase patient susceptibility to taxane neurotoxicity and thatthe use of SK3 blockers during taxanes administration may represent aninteresting approach for the prevention of this neurotoxicity.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0870 PMID: 30037821
