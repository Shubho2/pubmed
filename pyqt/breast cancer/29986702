Primary cancer cellsprovide a model to study the multiplicity of tumourigenic transformation, toinvestigate alterations of the cellular response to various molecular stimuli,and to test therapeutics for cancer treatment.METHODS: Here, we developed primary cultures of human breast tissue - normalcells (BN1), cancer cells (BC5), and cells from a chemotherapy-treated tumour(BrCCh1) to compare their response to conventional chemotherapeutics and toinnate immunity stimulators with that of the immortalized breast cells MCF7,MDA-MB-231, and MCF10A. Expression of the progesterone receptor (PGR), oestrogen receptor (ER) α and β, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and 3 andaromatase CYP19, as well as expression of interferon-induced protein withtetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) mRNA in human breast cells werecharacterized.RESULTS: We revealed that BC5 carcinoma cells were PGRlow/ERbhigh/ERa-/Cyp19+,the BrCCh1 cells that originated from the recurrent tumour werePGR-/ERb+/ERa-/Cyp19+, and normal BN cells were PGR-/ERb+/ERa-/Cyp19high. Thetreatment of primary culture cells with antitumour therapeutics revealed thatBrCCh1 cells were doxorubicine-resistant and sensitive to cisplatin. BC5 cellsexhibited low sensitivity to tamoxifen and cisplatin. The innate immunityactivators interferon-α and an artificial small nucleolar RNA analogue increased expression of IFIT3 at different levels in primary cells and in the immortalized breast cells MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MCF10A. The relative level of activation ofIFIT3 expression was inversely correlated with the baseline level of IFIT3 mRNAexpression in breast cell lines.CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that primary cancer cells are a useful modelfor the development of novel cancer treatments. Our findings suggest thatexpression of IFIT3 mRNA can be used as a prognostic marker of breast cancer cellsensitivity to immunostimulating therapeutics.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4635-8 PMCID: PMC6038312PMID: 29986702
