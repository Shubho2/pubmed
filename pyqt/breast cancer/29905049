All patients were females with the age of 32 to 59 years (mean, 41.5 years).There were 7 cases in left side and 5 cases in right side. Eight cases werereceived breast reconstruction by one-stage operation and 4 cases by two-stageoperation. In one-stage operation cases, pathological diagnosis includes invasiveductal carcinoma in 4 cases and invasive lobular carcinoma in 4 cases. Thedisease duration ranged from 2 to 9 months (mean, 4.5 months). In two-stageoperation cases, the time interval between mastectomy and breast reconstructionranged from 12 to 70 months (mean, 37.4 months). The length of flap was 20-28 cm,the width of flap was 5.5-7.5 cm, the thickness of flap was 2.5-4.5 cm. Thelength of gracilis flap pedicle was 6.5-9.2 cm, the length of adductor magnusperforator flap pedicle was 7.5-10.4 cm. The weight of flap was 295-615 g.Results: The ischemia time of flap ranged from 95 to 230 minutes (mean, 135minutes). All flaps were successfully survived. All incisions of recipient donor sites healed by first intention. All patients were followed up 7-14 months (mean,9.5 months). The reconstructed breasts' shape, texture, and elasticity were good and no flap contracture deformation happened. Only linear scar left in the donor sites, but the function of thighs was not affected. No local recurrence happened during follow-up.Conclusion: With appropriate patient selection and surgical technique, thecombined transverse upper gracilis flap and adductor magnus perforator flap canbe a valuable option as an alternative method for autologous breastreconstruction.Publisher: 探讨股薄肌皮瓣联合大收肌穿支皮瓣在乳腺癌术后乳房重建中的应用及疗效。.2016 年 8 月—2017 年 2月，应用股薄肌皮瓣联合大收肌穿支皮瓣对 12 例乳腺癌患者行乳房重建。患者均为女性；年龄 32～59 岁，平均 41.5 岁。左侧 7 例，右侧 5例。一期乳房重建 8 例，病理诊断为浸润性导管癌 4 例、浸润性小叶癌 4 例；病程 2～9 个月，平均 4.5 个月。二期乳房重建 4例，乳腺癌改良根治术至该次手术时间为 12～70 个月，平均 37.4 个月。术中切取股薄肌皮瓣联合大收肌穿支皮瓣长 20～28 cm、宽 5.5～7.5cm、厚 2.5～4.5 cm；股薄肌皮瓣血管蒂长度为 6.5～9.2 cm、大收肌穿支皮瓣血管蒂长度为 7.5～10.4 cm；皮瓣质量为 295～615g。.术中皮瓣缺血时间为 95～230 min，平均 135 min。术后皮瓣均顺利成活，供受区切口均Ⅰ期愈合。12 例患者均获随访，随访时间 7～14个月，平均 9.5个月。再造乳房外形可、弹性好，无皮瓣挛缩变形。腿部供区仅遗留线性瘢痕，腿部功能无明显受限。随访期间肿瘤无复发。.股薄肌皮瓣联合大收肌穿支皮瓣可作为乳腺癌术后乳房重建的选择之一。.DOI: 10.7507/1002-1892.201801001 PMID: 29905049
