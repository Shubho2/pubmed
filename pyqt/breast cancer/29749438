Their embryonic stem-like signature is associated withpoor clinical outcome. In the present study, the function of octamer-bindingtranscription factor 4 (Oct4), an embryonic stem cell factor, in the resistanceof BCSCs to IR was investigated. Mammosphere cells exhibited increased expressionof stemness-associated genes, including Oct4 and sex‑determining region Y‑box 2(Sox2), and were more resistant to IR compared with serum-cultured monolayercells. IR‑resistant MCF7 cells also exhibited significantly increased expression of Oct4. To investigate the possible involvement of Oct4 in IR resistance ofbreast cancer cells, cells were transfected with Oct4. Ectopic expression of Oct4increased the clonogenic survival of MCF7 cells following IR, which was reversed by treatment with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Oct4. Oct4 expressiondecreased phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) focus formation and suppressedIR‑induced premature senescence in these cells. Mammosphere, IR‑resistant andOct4‑overexpressing MCF7 cells exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of signaltransducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) (Tyr705) and inhibitor ofnuclear factor κB (NF‑κB), and blockade of these pathways with siRNA againstSTAT3 and/or specific inhibitors of STAT3 and NF‑κB significantly increasedIR‑induced senescence. Secretome analysis revealed that Oct4 upregulatedinterleukin 24 (IL‑24) expression through STAT3 and NF‑κB signaling, and siRNAagainst IL‑24 increased IR‑induced senescence, whereas recombinant human IL‑24suppressed it. The results of the present study indicated that Oct4 confers IRresistance on breast cancer cells by suppressing IR‑induced premature senescence through STAT3- and NF‑κB-mediated IL‑24 production.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4391 PMCID: PMC5958730PMID: 29749438
