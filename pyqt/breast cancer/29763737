This study aimed to validate previously reported associations usingthe largest independent breast cancer sample to date and to evaluate furtherfunctional cytokine variants in relation to total CRF and all relevant CRFsubdomains (physical, cognitive, and affective CRF).METHOD: 45 candidate SNPs in inflammatory pathway genes were selected based onprevious reports (16 SNPs) or regulatory function (29 SNPs). Breast cancerpatients recruited between 2002 and 2005 provided information on CRF at firstfollow-up (FU1) (N = 1389) and second follow-up (FU2) (N = 950), a median of6.2 years and 11.7 years respectively after diagnosis. SNP associations wereassessed using linear regression models on CRF scores separately for FU1 and FU2.Additionally, patients with persistent fatigue (fatigued at both time-points)were compared to those never fatigued using logistic regression models (N = 684).All analyses were adjusted for relevant covariates. Secondary analyses wereconducted for CRF subdomains.RESULTS: For total CRF none of the previously reported associations wereconfirmed after correction for multiple testing. The p-value distribution of all SNPs was not different than the one expected by chance. Analyses of CRFsubdomains yielded a significant association between TNF-α rs3093662 andpersistent physical CRF (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.23, 95% Confidence Interval(CI) = 1.71-6.10, p = 0.0003).CONCLUSION: We were unable to confirm previously reported findings, suggestingthat individual SNPs are unlikely to be of clinical utility. Furtherinvestigations in well powered studies are warranted, which consider geneticheterogeneity according to subdomains of CRF.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
