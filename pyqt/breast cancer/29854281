The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate if occurrence of HTN is correlated with response to second line treatment withramucirumab+paclitaxel for metastatic gastric cancer.Methods: Treatment consisted of ramucirumab 8 mg/kg intravenously (iv) on days 1 and 15, plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 iv on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.Patients received study treatment until disease progression, unacceptabletoxicity, or withdrawal of consent.Results: Thirty-four patients were retrospectively evaluated. Among these, 6(17.6%) developed grade 3 ramucirumab-induced HTN. These patients had a betteroutcome than those with lesser grades events, with a progression-free survival(PFS) of 7.8 months (95% CI 4.4-not reached) versus 4.2 months (95% CI 3.1-5.2)(p=0.001). overall survival (OS) was 11.9 months (95% CI 9.3-not reached) in the grade 3 HTN group, versus 7.2 months (95% CI 5.9-10.1).Conclusions: Despite the small number of patients and the retrospective nature ofthe data, our analysis showed that occurrence of ramucirumab-related HTN, inparticular G3 HTN, predicts response to treatment with ramucirumab+paclitaxel in patients with metastatic gastric cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24900 PMCID: PMC5976467PMID: 29854281
