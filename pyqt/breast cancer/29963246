From fat grafting, to flap placement, to implants, there is noguarantee that reconstruction will not stimulate breast cancer recurrence.Research in this field is clearly divided into two parts: scientificinterventional studies and clinical retrospective evidence. The reconstructiveprocedure offers hypoxia, a wound microenvironment, bacterial load, adiposederived stem cells; agents shown experimentally to cause increased cancer cellactivity. This is compelling scientific evidence which serves to bringuncertainty and fear to the reconstructive procedure. In the absence of clinical evidence, this laboratory literature landscape is now informing surgical choices.Curiously, clinical studies have not shown a clear link between breast cancerrecurrence and reconstructive surgery. Where does that leave us? This review aimsto analyze the science and the surgery, thereby understanding the oncologicalfear which accompanies breast cancer reconstruction.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25602 PMCID: PMC6021250PMID: 29963246
