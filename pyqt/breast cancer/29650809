Gan To Kagaku Ryoho. 2018 Apr;45(4):587-592.[Molecular Targeted Therapies for Hereditary Cancer Syndrome].[Article in Japanese]Shimodaira H(1).Author information: (1)Division of Medical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Tohoku Medical andPharmaceutical University.Development of molecular targeted drugs has achieved remarkable improvement ofsystemic cancer therapy. Recently, the several molecular targeted drugs havebecome available which associated with the status of responsible genes forhereditary cancer syndrome. These drugs would allow to establish specificstrategy for hereditary cancer syndrome or sporadic cancers with similarbiological phenotype with hereditary cancer. Genetic tests for the diagnosis ofhereditary cancer syndrome will have the meaning of biomarker for predicting the efficacy of these molecular targeted drugs. This review summarized the molecular targeted drugs including immune checkpoint inhibitors with potential effects for hereditary cancer syndrome, such as anti-PD-1 antibody for Lynch syndrome, PARPinhibitor for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, multi-kinaseinhibitor for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.PMID: 29650809  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
