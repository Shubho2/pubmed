Electronic address:ajouyban@hotmail.com.Folate receptor (FR) is overexpressed in various cancer cells while itsexpression in normal cells is restricted. The present study provides a new folic acid/folate (FA) functionalized nanomaterials to sense and the differentiation ofthe cancer cells from normal ones. The reported nanoprobe is based on themesoporous materials that are functionalized with FA to specify the FRoverexpressed cancerous cells. MCF 7 cell lines were used as a model to show the ability of the developed probe for cancer cell detection. The selective bindingof FA to FR-positive cells causes the endocytosis of the mesoporous materialsinto the cells where it can be observed by fluorescence microscopy images. Thespecific nature of the binding of the FA functionalized mesoporous silicaprevents the false detection of normal cells from cancerous cells even in thepresence of each other. The cytotoxicity of the n-Pr-NH2-MCM 41-FA on the MCF 7cells was investigated using MTT assay. The reported method can detect the MCF 7 cells from 100 to 1000 cells/mL. This method provides a selective and nontoxicapproach towards detection of breast cancer cell lines while it can be developed as a point of care (POC) device for early detection of cancer. Finally, the MCF 7cancer cells were treated with doxorubicin anti-cancer drug and our device detectthe trace amount of MCF 7 based on their electrochemical activity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
