We undertook apopulation-level examination of imaging practices in Ontario as they existedbefore the launch of that initiative.Methods: Patients diagnosed with ebc between 2006 and 2010 in Ontario wereidentified from the Ontario Cancer Registry. Records were linkeddeterministically to provincial health care databases to obtain comprehensivefollow-up. We identified all advanced imaging exams [aies: computed tomography(ct), bone scan, positron-emission tomography] and basic imaging exams (bies:ultrasonography, chest radiography) occurring within the first 2 years aftercurative treatment. Poisson regression was used to assess associations betweenpatient or provider characteristics and the rate of aies.Results: Of 30,006 women with ebc, 58.6% received at least 1 bie, and 30.6%received at least 1 aie in year 1 after treatment. In year 2, 52.7% received atleast 1 bie, and 25.7% received at least 1 aie. The most common aies were chestcts and bone scans. The rate of aies increased with older age, higher diseasestage, comorbidity, chemotherapy exposure, and prior staging investigations (p < 0.001). Imaging was ordered mainly by medical oncologists (38%), followed byprimary care physicians (23%), surgeons (13%), and emergency room physicians(7%).Conclusions: Despite recommendations against its use, imaging is common in ebcsurvivors. Understanding the factors associated with aie use helps to identifyareas for further research and is required to lower imaging rates and to improve survivorship care.DOI: 10.3747/co.25.3838 PMCID: PMC5927783PMID: 29719428
