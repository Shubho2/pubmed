A better understanding on themolecular mechanisms underlying the metastasis and recurrence is crucial toimprove the treatment of this lethal disease. MCF-7 cells were xenografted intomice until visible tumor developed and the cells from tumor tissue and adjacentnormal tissue were cultured with 3 passages as MT cells and IT cells,respectively. Microarray analysis was performed to detect several viableMicroRNAs in these two types of cells. Further, MiR-30 knockdown was used toinvestigate its role in tumor aggression. Relative levels of miR-30 weresignificantly higher in IT cells than MT cells. Knockdown of miR-30 in both MTand IT cells lowered cell proliferation and cell invasion abilities, and thusincreased the survival time of mice xenografted with tumor cells. This studysuggested that the knockdown of miR-30 decreased proliferation and invasion ofcarcinoma cells, giving rise to the potential of miR-30 as tumor target or markercandidate for breast cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1139/bcb-2018-0032 PMID: 29894647
