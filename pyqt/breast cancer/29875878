Prevention programs insist on the early diagnosis and screening to reduce the mortality rate.AIM: The study was conducted to determine the predictors of breast cancerscreening behaviours based on the health belief model.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present cross-sectional study was conducted byinvolving 304 women ranging from 20 to 65 years of age, living in East Guilancities, the North of Iran, in 2015 using two-stage cluster sampling. The researchinstrument was Champion's Health Belief Model Scale. The data were analysed basedon Regression test by using SPSS software version 18.RESULTS: The results showed perceived benefits (ExpB = 1.118, p = 0.009),self-efficacy (ExpB = 1.122, p = 0.001) and the perceived barriers (ExpB = 0.851,p = 0.001) as the predictors of breast self-examination. In addition, the studyrevealed that the two components of perceived benefits (ExpB = 1.202), and theperceived barriers were the predictors of mammography (ExpB = 0.864) (p = 0.001).None of the health belief model components showed a role to predict clinicalbreast examination (P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the need for educational programs, whichshould focus on increasing breast self-exam skills and understanding the benefitsof healthy behaviours and eliminating their barriers.DOI: 10.3889/oamjms.2018.183 PMCID: PMC5985873PMID: 29875878
