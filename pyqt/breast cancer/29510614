Although the roles of IP inother cancers, and inflammatory diseases have been extensively studied, itssignificance in breast cancer is unclear.Materials and Methods: We investigated the expression of LMP7, an IP subunit, andits relationship with immune system components in two breast cancer cohorts.Results: In 668 consecutive breast cancer cohort, 40% of tumors showed high levelof LMP7 expression, and tumors with high expression of LMP7 had moretumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in each subtype of breast cancer. Inanother cohort of 681 triple-negative breast cancer patients cohort, theexpression of LMP7 in tumor cells was significantly correlated with the amount ofTILs and the expression of interferon-associated molecules (MxA [p < 0.001] andPKR [p < 0.001]), endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated molecules (PERK[p=0.012], p-eIF2a [p=0.001], and XBP1 [p < 0.001]), and damage-associatedmolecular patterns (HMGN1 [p < 0.001] and HMGB1 [p < 0.001]). Patients withhigher LMP7 expression had better disease-free survival outcomes than those with no or low expression in the positive lymph node metastasis group (p=0.041).Conclusion: Close association between the TIL levels and LMP7 expression inbreast cancer indicates that better antigen presentation through greater LMP7expression might be associated with more TILs.DOI: 10.4143/crt.2017.500 PMID: 29510614
