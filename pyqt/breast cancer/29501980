Electronic address: liuhongke@njnu.edu.cn.Metal-arene complexes containing bioactive natural-product derived ligands canhave new and unusual properties. We report the synthesis, characterization andantiproliferative activity of two new Ru(II) arene complexes with imidazole(dichlorido complex 1) or bipyridyl (chlorido complex 2) ligands conjugated to18β-glycyrrhetinic acid, an active triterpenoid metabolite of Glycyrrhiza glabra.In general, the conjugated ligands and complexes showed only moderate activityagainst HeLa (cervical), MCF-7 (breast) and A2780 (ovarian) cancer cells,although the activity of complex 2 in the former two cell lines approached thatof the drug cisplatin. Complex 2 (in contrast to complex 1) also exhibitedsignificant activity towards both Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E.coil bacteria. Complex 2 can induce condensation of DNA and enhances thegeneration of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). The conjugation ofnatural products to ligands in organometallic half-sandwich complexes provides a strategy to enhance their biological activities.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
