The identification of cancer largely depends on digitalbiomedical photography analysis such as histopathological images by doctors andphysicians. Analyzing histopathological images is a nontrivial task, anddecisions from investigation of these kinds of images always require specialised knowledge. However, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) techniques can help the doctormake more reliable decisions. The state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network (DNN) has been recently introduced for biomedical image analysis. Normally each imagecontains structural and statistical information. This paper classifies a set ofbiomedical breast cancer images (BreakHis dataset) using novel DNN techniquesguided by structural and statistical information derived from the images.Specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Long-Short-Term-Memory(LSTM), and a combination of CNN and LSTM are proposed for breast cancer imageclassification. Softmax and Support Vector Machine (SVM) layers have been usedfor the decision-making stage after extracting features utilising the proposednovel DNN models. In this experiment the best Accuracy value of 91.00% isachieved on the 200x dataset, the best Precision value 96.00% is achieved on the 40x dataset, and the best F-Measure value is achieved on both the 40x and 100xdatasets.DOI: 10.1155/2018/2362108 PMCID: PMC5863327PMID: 29707566
