Electronic address: fzhang@chem.ecnu.edu.cn.A novel electrochemical DNA (E-DNA) biosensing strategy was designed and used forthe detection of breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA-1). The biosensor wasbased on gold nanoparticles-reduced graphene oxide (AuNPs-GO) modified glasscarbon electrode (GCE) covered with the layer of molecularly imprinted polymers(MIPs) synthesized with rhodamine B (RhB) as template, methacrylic acid (MAA) as the monomer, and Nafion as additive. The signal amplification tracing tag SiO2@AgNPs were prepared by covering AgNPs on the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in situ,and then DNA probes were modified on AgNPs by Ag-S bond, forming the compositesSiO2@Ag/DNA. In presence of target DNA (T-DNA), homogeneous hybridization wasperformed with SiO2@Ag/DNA and RhB labeled DNA, and the resultingSiO2@Ag/dsDNA/RhB was specifically recognized by MIPs via the interaction betweenimprinting cavities and RhB. Under optimal conditions, the proposed biosensorexhibited wide linear range from 10 fM to 100 nM, low detection limit of 2.53 fM (S/N = 3), excellent selectivity, reproducibility, stability, and feasibility in serum analysis. Overall, these findings suggest the promising prospects of theproposed biosensing strategy in clinical diagnostics.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
