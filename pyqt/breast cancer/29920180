This paper aimed to determine if supports provided by health serviceswere adequate in meeting the expressed needs of women and partners duringsurvivorship.METHODS: A mixed method study consisted of: (1) in-depth interviews with women(n = 18) and partners (n = 8), (completed June 2014-November 2014) and (2) aquestionnaire with health providers (n = 34) (completed April 2015) regardingservices offered, needs addressed and barriers to service delivery. Both werecompleted in Perth, Western Australia. Findings were determined using thematicanalysis and descriptive statistics.RESULTS: Many unmet needs were identified by women and partners, including: pain;fatigue; fear of recurrence; employment, leisure, social and intimacydifficulties. Participants did not receive a formal plan to assist them. Healthproviders reported a range of supports, including cancer surveillance andmanagement of physical, psychological, emotional and relationship concerns.However, many barriers concerning service delivery were identified.CONCLUSION: Despite services reporting that they provided various supports,interview participants did not appear to use and benefit from these. Coordinationof service delivery was identified as requiring improvement. The use ofsurvivorship care plans also needs refinement to determine suitability for useduring survivorship.DOI: 10.1080/03630242.2018.1478362 PMID: 29920180
