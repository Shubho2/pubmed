Next, we carried out a clinical validation of our method usingplasma cfDNA samples from 78 patients with advanced colorectal cancer,non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer or melanoma and comparedresults with patients' outcomes.Results: Median methylation scores in plasma cfDNA samples from patients ontherapy were lower than from patients off therapy (4.74 versus 85.29; P = 0.001).Of 68 plasma samples from patients off therapy, methylation scores detected thepresence of cancer in 57 (83.8%), and methylation-based signatures accuratelyclassified the underlying cancer type in 45 (78.9%) of these. Methylation scores were most accurate in detecting colorectal cancer (96.3%), followed by breastcancer (91.7%), melanoma (81.8%) and NSCLC (61.1%), and most accurate inclassifying the underlying cancer type in colorectal cancer (88.5%), followed by NSCLC (81.8%), breast cancer (72.7%) and melanoma (55.6%). Low methylation scoresversus high were associated with longer survival (10.4 versus 4.4 months,P < 0.001) and longer time-to-treatment failure (2.8 versus 1.6 months,P = 0.016).Conclusions: Comprehensive targeted methylation sequencing of 9223 CpG sites inplasma cfDNA from patients with common advanced cancers detects the presence ofcancer and underlying cancer type with high accuracy. Methylation scores inplasma cfDNA correspond with treatment outcomes.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy119 PMCID: PMC6005020 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29635542
