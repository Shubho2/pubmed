Using C.elegans embryos we show that the LEM-3/Ankle1 nuclease defines a previouslyundescribed genome integrity mechanism by processing DNA bridges right beforecells divide. LEM-3 acts at the midbody, the structure where abscission occurs atthe end of cytokinesis. LEM-3 localization depends on factors needed for midbody assembly, and LEM-3 accumulation is increased and prolonged when chromatinbridges are trapped at the cleavage plane. LEM-3 locally processes chromatinbridges that arise from incomplete DNA replication, unresolved recombinationintermediates, or the perturbance of chromosome structure. Proper LEM-3 midbodylocalization and function is regulated by AIR-2/Aurora B kinase. Strikingly,LEM-3 acts cooperatively with the BRC-1/BRCA1 homologous recombination factor to promote genome integrity. These findings provide a molecular basis for thesuspected role of the LEM-3 orthologue Ankle1 in human breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03135-w PMCID: PMC5820297PMID: 29463814  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
