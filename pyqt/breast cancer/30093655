ATRA inhibits leukemia, breast, and livercancer by targeting isomerase Pin1, a master regulator of oncogenicsignalingÂ networks. Here we show that ATO targets Pin1 and cooperates with ATRAto exert potent anticancer activity. ATO inhibits and degrades Pin1, andsuppresses its oncogenic function by noncovalent binding to Pin1's active site.ATRA increases cellular ATO uptake through upregulating aquaporin-9. ATO andATRA, at clinically safe doses, cooperatively ablate Pin1 to block numerouscancer-driving pathways and inhibit the growth of triple-negative breast cancercells and tumor-initiating cells in cell and animal models includingpatient-derived orthotopic xenografts, like Pin1 knockout, which is substantiatedby comprehensive protein and microRNA analyses. Thus, synergistic targeting ofPin1 by ATO and ATRA offers an attractive approach to combating breast and other cancers.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05402-2 PMID: 30093655
