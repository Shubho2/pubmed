Their numbers are elevated in breast, lung, and ovariancancers. HER2-positive cancers are aggressive, have higher mortality rate, andhave a poor prognosis. We have designed peptidomimetics that bind to HER2 andblock the HER2-mediated dimerization of epidermal growth factor family ofreceptors. Among these, a symmetrical cyclic peptidomimetic (compound 18)exhibited antiproliferative activity in HER2-overexpressing lung cancer celllines with IC50 values in the nanomolar concentration range. To improve thestability of the peptidomimetic, d-amino acids were introduced into thepeptidomimetic, and several analogs of compound 18 were designed. Among theanalogs of compound 18, compound 32, a cyclic, d-amino acid-containingpeptidomimetic, was found to have an IC50 value in the nanomolar range inHER2-overexpressing cancer cell lines. The antiproliferative activity of compound32 was also measured by using a 3D cell culture model that mimics the in vivoconditions. The binding of compound 32 to the HER2 protein was studied by surfaceplasmon resonance. In vitro stability studies indicated that compound 32 wasstable in serum for 48 hours and intact peptide was detectable in vivo for12 hours. Results from our studies indicated that 1 of the d-amino acid analogsof 18, compound 32, binds to the HER2 extracellular domain, inhibiting thephosphorylation of kinase of HER2.Copyright © 2018 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/psc.3066 PMID: 29436155
