As the first report addressing this topic, the present study aimed to estimate the number of patients eligible for HT in Fars province and the whole ofIran. The data were collected through direct inspection of medical records of thepatients treated at the Radiotherapy Department, Namazi Hospital, Shiraz, Iran in2014. The patients who were treated with external-beam radiotherapy and declared to be a resident of Fars province were extracted from the medical records. After classification based on appropriate indications and factors, the number ofeligible patients in Iran was calculated by scaling (Iran: Fars population). Ofthe 2,932 medical records, 1,943 patients were treated with external-beamradiotherapy, among which 1,536 were from Fars. The total number of patientseligible for HT in Fars was >351 cases/year (22.9% of the treated patients). The cancer site distribution of the eligible Fars residents was central nervoussystem primary tumors (n=31), brain metastases (n=64), eye (n=7), head and neck(n=28); thyroid (n=4), lung (n=17), breast (n=56), esophagus (n=5); pancreas(n=5), gastric (n=32), liver and bile duct (n=0), rectum and anus (n=26);prostate (n=27), bladder (n=8), cervix (n=6), soft tissue (n=17); kidney (n=1),Hodgkin lymphoma (n=9), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=4), and bone metastases (n=4). A total number of 5,756 cases/year was estimated for the entire country.Considering the experiences of other countries, these results suggest thatestablishing at least two HT centers (covering the northern and southern parts ofIran) is justified based on the total number of patients. Further accurateestimations and cost evaluations are recommended.PMCID: PMC5993909PMID: 29892149
