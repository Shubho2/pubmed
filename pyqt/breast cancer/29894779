The combined FC of miRNA-221/222 were 13.85 and 13.75 in thyroid cancer with normal control.For miRNA-221/222, the pooled sensitivity was 0.79 (95% CI = 0.73-0.85),specificity was 0.84 (95% CI = 0.76-0.90) and AUC (area under the curve) valuewas 0.88 (0.85-0.91). For miRNA-221, the pooled sensitivity was 0.82 (95%CI = 0.76-0.86) and specificity was 0.84 (95%CI = 0.74-0.91). For miRNA-222, the pooled sensitivity was 0.78 (95%CI = 0.68-0.85) and specificity was 0.83 (95%CI = 0.70-0.92).CONCLUSION: Differences in expression levels of miRNA-221/222 can provide cluesfor exploring the etiology of thyroid cancer. In addition, miRNA-221/222 werepromising molecular biomarkers that may significantly improve the diagnosticaccuracy of thyroid cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
