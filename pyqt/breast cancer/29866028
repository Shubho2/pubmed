India.BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is most widely occurring non-cutaneous cancer in women.Treatment options available for breast cancer are limited and there are a number of toxicity concerns associated with them. Therefore, nanocarrier basedapproaches have been explored for breast cancer treatment. Nanocarriersimplemented for breast cancer treatment are nanoliposomes, polymericnanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, goldnanoparticles, dendrimers, and protein nanocages.OBJECTIVE: Objective of this review was to explore the therapeutic efficacy ofvarious nanocarrier systems against breast cancer.METHOD: Existing literature regarding nanocarrier systems for breast cancertherapy was reviewed using Pubmed and Google Scholar.RESULTS: Nanocarriers may show prolonged circulation time of chemotherapeuticagent with efficient breast tumor targeting. Both active and passive targetingmethodologies can be explored to target breast cancer cells using differentnanocarriers. Targeted nanocarriers have the capability to reduce side effectscaused by various conventional formulations used to treat breast cancer.CONCLUSION: Various nanocarriers listed above have shown their therapeuticpotential in preclinical studies to treat breast cancer. Satisfactory clinicalevaluation and scale up techniques can promote their entry into thepharmaceutical market in greater extent.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/2211738506666180604101920 PMID: 29866028
