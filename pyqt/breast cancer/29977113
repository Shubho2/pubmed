Pre-postassociations between breast cancer screening knowledge and intent were tested.Results: Participants were on average were 56.7 years of age and spoke primarily Spanish (92.6%). Most of the samples had not had a mammogram in 3 or more years(51.6%) and 14.6% had never had a mammogram. At baseline, the majority intendedto be screened for breast cancer within the next 6 months (93.4%). Atpostintervention, half of the intervention group changed their 6-month intent to be screened for breast cancer from likely to unlikely. Change in intent wasassociated with a change in knowledge of risk of having a first child by the age of 30 and breast cancer being rare after the age of 70.Discussion: Intent to be screened for breast cancer in Mexican-origin women maybe influenced by the type of knowledge.Conclusions: Change in screening knowledge may influence perceived risk thatinfluences intention to be screened.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418782904 PMCID: PMC6024335PMID: 29977113
