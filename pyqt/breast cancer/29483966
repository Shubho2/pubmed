China.Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous diseaseclosely associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This studyaimed to investigate the role of EMT in metaplastic carcinoma. Methods:E-cadherin, Slug, Twist and Vimentin levels were detected by immunohistochemistryin 167 TNBC tumors, including 145 invasive carcinomas of no special type(ICONSTs), 14 spindle cell carcinomas (SpCCs) and 8 matrix-producing carcinomas(MPCs). Results: Nuclear Slug and Twist were more frequently detected in SpCC andMPC tumors than that in ICONST tumors (p<0.001). The rate of E-cadherin loss was much lower in the ICONST tumors than that in the SpCC and MPC tumors (p<0.001).Vimentin was expressed in all SpCC and MPC tumors. Furthermore, nuclearexpression of Slug and Twist was positively associated with the cytoplasmiclocalization of Vimentin (p<0.001) and was inversely associated with membranousstaining of E-cadherin (p<0.001). These trends were more apparent in the SpCC andMPC tumors than in the ICONST tumors. Follow-up data were available for 151patients. The follow-up times ranged from 1 month to 11 years (mean: 74 m;median: 21 m). The median progression-free survival and overall survival timeswere 24 months (mean: 32 months) and 22 months (mean: 35 months), respectively.Tumor size, TNM stage and E-cadherin were found to be independent prognosticfactors of TNBC. Conclusions: EMT may play an important role in TNBC, especially in MPC and SpCC. Further researches are needed to confirm this finding. Theresults of this study may facilitate the future development of targeted therapiesbased on alterations in the EMT and stem cell markers.DOI: 10.7150/jca.19190 PMCID: PMC5820928PMID: 29483966
