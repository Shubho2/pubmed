There is a gap in theliterature capturing experiences of people living with BCRL who use complementarytherapies.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected from 26 participants via asemi-structured interview. Questioning centred around their personal experiences of living with lymphoedema, and their use of reflexology lymphatic drainage.RESULTS: Four main themes emerged which comprised physical and psycho-socialimpacts of lymphoedema, experiences of physical change, and the return ofoptimism. RLD treatment was considered pleasant and non invasive, and thereduction in swelling helped with pain and mobility.CONCLUSION: The main conclusion from this qualitative evaluation was thatparticipants perceived benefit on physical and psychological levels.Participation in the study appeared to help re-engagement with normal life.Further research is needed to quantify the changes in these parameters.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
