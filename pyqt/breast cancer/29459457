We prospectivelyinvestigated tamoxifen efficacy by serum endoxifen levels and the tamoxifenactivity score (TAS).Experimental Design: A prospective observational multicenterstudy included postmenopausal women with an estrogen receptor-positive breastcancer receiving first-line tamoxifen, 20 mg daily in the neoadjuvant ormetastatic setting, recruited between February 2009 and May 2014. The primaryendpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) using RECIST criteria 1.0.Secondary endpoints were clinical benefit (CB), progression-free survival (PFS), and tolerability of tamoxifen. The main analysis used logistic regression torelate ORR to serum endoxifen levels after 3 months. Endpoints were also related to other tamoxifen metabolites and to TAS.Results: Endoxifen levels wereavailable for 247 of all 297 patients (83%), of which 209 with target lesions(85%). Median follow-up time for PFS was 32.5 months, and 62% progressed. ORR andCB were 45% and 84%, respectively. ORR was not related to endoxifen, and the ORof ORR was 1.008 per μg/L increase in endoxifen (95% confidence interval,0.971-1.046; P = 0.56). In general, none of the endpoints was associated withendoxifen levels, tamoxifen metabolites, or TAS.Conclusions: Under theprespecified assumptions, the results from this prospective clinical trial do notsuggest therapeutic drug monitoring of endoxifen to be of clinical value inpostmenopausal women treated with tamoxifen for breast cancer in the neoadjuvant or metastatic setting.
