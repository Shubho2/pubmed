Inthis study, we analyzed the expression of HER 1-4 proteins, and investigatedwhether or not their expression was predictive of the response of advancedHER2-positive breast cancer to chemotherapy with the TPD regimen.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 29 cases in which TPD regimenchemotherapy was carried out from September 2013 to November 2015. The expressionlevels of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), Ki67, HER1, HER2, HER3 and HER4 were evaluated using immunostaining employing needle biopsyspecimens.RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in theHER3-positive group than in the HER3-negative group (p=0.002). In prognosticanalysis, the HER3-positive group showed a significant progression-free survival extension over the HER3-negative group (p=0.042, log-rank). In univariateanalysis, objective response (p=0.004, hazard ratio(HR)=0.123) and positive HER3 expression (p=0.023, HR=0.279) significantly contributed to extension ofprogression-free survival interval.CONCLUSION: HER3 expression may be a useful factor for predicting the response ofHER2-positive breast cancer to chemotherapy with the TPD regimen.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12473 PMID: 29599351  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
