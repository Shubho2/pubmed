Electronic address:dkado@ucsd.edu.Breast cancer is the most common cancer of women in the United States. It is alsoproving to be one of the most treatable. Early detection, surgical intervention, therapeutic radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapies and molecularly targeted agentsare transforming the lives of patients with breast cancer, markedly improvingtheir survival. Although current breast cancer treatments are largely successful in producing cancer remission and extending lifespan, there is concern that thesetreatments may have long lasting detrimental effects on cancer survivors, inpart, through their impact on non-tumor cells. Presently, the impact of breastcancer treatment on normal cells, its impact on cellular function and its effect on the overall function of the individual are incompletely understood. Inparticular, it is unclear whether breast cancer and/or its treatments areassociated with an accelerated aging phenotype. In this review, we considerbreast cancer survivorship from the perspective of accelerated aging, and discussthe evidence suggesting that women treated for breast cancer may suffer from anincreased rate of physical and cognitive decline that likely corresponds withunderlying vulnerabilities of genome instability, epigenetic changes, andcellular senescence.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
