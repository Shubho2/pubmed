Thirty-nine women with breast cancerunderwent DCE-US and DCE-MRI before the NAC, follow-up DCE-US after the firstcycle of NAC, and follow-up DCE-MRI after the second cycle of NAC. DCE-MRIparameters (transfer constant [Ktrans], reverse constant [kep], and leakage space[Ve]) were assessed with histograms. From DCE-US, peak-enhancement, the areaunder the curve, wash-in rate, wash-out rate, time to peak, and rise time (RT)were obtained. After surgery, all the imaging parameters and their changes werecompared with histopathologic response using the Miller-Payne Grading (MPG)system. Data from minor and good responders were compared using Wilcoxon rank sumtest, chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used for assessing diagnostic performance to predict goodresponse.Results: Twelve patients (30.8%) showed a good response (MPG 4 or 5) and 27(69.2%) showed a minor response (MPG 1-3). The mean, 25th, 50th, and 75thpercentiles of Ktrans and Kep of post-NAC DCE-MRI differed between the twogroups. These parameters showed fair to good diagnostic performance for theprediction of response to NAC (AUC 0.76-0.81, p â‰¤ 0.007). Among DCE-USparameters, the percentage change in RT showed fair prediction (AUC 0.71, p =0.023).Conclusion: Quantitative analysis of DCE-MRI and DCE-US was helpful for earlyprediction of response to NAC.DOI: 10.3348/kjr.2018.19.4.682 PMCID: PMC6005946PMID: 29962874
