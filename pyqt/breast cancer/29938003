However, for a large proportion of cases (around 50%), the genetic cause remains unknown. These cases are grouped in a separated BRCAX category. The aim of this study was toidentify genomic alterations in BRCA1/BRCA2 wild-type tumor samples from womenwith family history strongly suggestive of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer.Results: A cohort of 31 Brazilian women was included in the study. Using theGISTIC algorithm, we identified 20 regions with genomic gains and 31 with losses.The most frequent altered regions were 1q21.2, 6p22.1 and 8p23.3 in breast tumorsand Xq26 and Xp22.32-22.31 among the ovarian cancer cases. An interestingassociation identified was the loss of 22q13.31-13.32 and the presence of ovariancancer cases. Among the genes present in the frequently altered regions, we foundFGFR1, NSMCE2, CTTN, CRLF2, ERBB2, STARD3, MIR3201 and several genes of RAET and ULBP family.Conclusions: In conclusion, our results suggest that alterations on chromosomes1, 6, 8 and X are common on BRCAX tumors and that the loss on 22q can beassociated with the presence of ovarian cancer.Methods: DNA copy number alterations were analyzed by 60K array comparativegenomic hybridization in breast and ovarian FFPE tumors.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25537 PMCID: PMC6007956PMID: 29938003
