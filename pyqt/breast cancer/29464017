Buildingevidence suggests that these drugs inhibit interphase signaling events and thatthis contributes to their anticancer actions. The effects of diverse MTAs wereevaluated following a 2 hour incubation with clinically relevant concentrationsto test the hypothesis that these drugs rapidly and differentially disruptepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related signaling. The MTAs rapidlypromoted the cortical localization of internal pools of E-cadherin in HCC1937breast cancer cells, with the most robust effects observed with the microtubuledestabilizers eribulin and vinorelbine. Cortical E-cadherin localization was alsopromoted by the Src kinase inhibitor dasatinib or by siRNA-mediated depletion of the p130Cas scaffold. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that eribulin disrupts the interaction between p130Cas and Src, leading to decreased cortical Srcphosphorylation that precedes the accumulation of cortical E-cadherin. Theseresults suggest that microtubules can be actively co-opted by cancer cells toinhibit cortical E-cadherin localization, a hallmark of EMT, and provide a directlink between the initial disruption of the microtubule network and reversal ofEMT phenotypes demonstrated by eribulin in long-term studies.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23798 PMCID: PMC5814157PMID: 29464017
