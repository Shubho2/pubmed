UHRF1 isoverexpressed in various cancers, including breast cancer. The tandem tudordomain (TTD) of UHRF1 specifically and tightly binds to histone H3 di- ortrimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me2 or H3K9me3, respectively), and this binding isessential for UHRF1 function. We developed an H3K9me3 peptide displacement assay,which was used to screen a library of 44,000 compounds for small molecules thatdisrupt the UHRF1-H3K9me3 interaction. This screen resulted in the identificationof NV01, which bound to UHRF1-TTD with a Kd value of 5 μM. The structure ofUHRF1-TTD in complex with NV01 confirmed binding to the H3K9me3-binding pocket.Limited structure-based optimization of NV01 led to the discovery of NV03 (Kd of 2.4 μM). These well-characterized small-molecule antagonists of theUHRF1-H3K9me2/3 interaction could be valuable starting chemical matter fordeveloping more potent and cell-active probes toward further characterizing UHRF1function, with possible applications as anticancer therapeutics.DOI: 10.1177/2472555218766278 PMID: 29562800
