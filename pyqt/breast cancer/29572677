Quantitative transcriptionalsignatures are highly sensitive to the measurement variation and sample quality. Here, we developed a robust qualitative signature, based on within-samplerelative expression orderings (REOs) of genes, to reclassify ER status.METHODS: From the gene pairs with significantly stable REOs in ER+ samples andreversely stable REOs in ER- samples, concordantly identified from four datasets,we extracted a signature to determine a sample's ER status through evaluatingwhether the REOs within the sample significantly match with the ER+ REOs or theER- REOs.RESULTS: A signature with 112 gene pairs was extracted. It was validated through evaluating whether the reclassified ER+ or ER- patients could benefit fromtamoxifen therapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In three datasets forIHC-determined ER+ patients treated with post-operative tamoxifen therapy,11.6-12.4% patients were reclassified as ER- by the signature and, as expected,they had significantly worse recurrence-free survival than the ER+ patientsconfirmed by the signature. On another hand, in two datasets for IHC-determinedER- patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 18.8 and 7.8% patients werereclassified as ER+â€‰and, as expected, their pathological complete response ratewas significantly lower than that of the other ER- patients confirmed by thesignature.CONCLUSIONS: The REO-based signature can provide an objective assessment of ERstatus of breast cancer patients and effectively reduce misjudgments of ER statusby IHC.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4758-2 PMID: 29572677
