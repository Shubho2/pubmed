LncRNAs can be regulated by key oncogenes andtumor suppressors, adding complexity to the intricate crosstalk between proteincoding genes and the noncoding transcriptome. In our study, we investigated theeffect that dysregulation of the key tumor suppressor PTEN has on the noncodingtranscriptome. We identified the lncRNA metastasis associated lung adenocarcinomatranscript 1 (MALAT1) as a target of PTEN and find that this regulation isconserved in both human and mouse as well as with both chronic and acute PTENdysregulation. We show that this regulation is at least in part microRNA(miRNA)-dependent, and characterize the miRNAs that may be mediating thiscrosstalk. In summary, we establish and characterize a non-canonicalPTEN-microRNA-MALAT1 axis that regulates tumorigenesis and describe for the firsttime that the MALAT1 lncRNA possesses novel tumor suppressive properties in colonand breast cancers.Â© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31386 PMID: 29574704
