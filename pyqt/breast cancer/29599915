To explore anon-taxane triple therapy, we conducted a feasibility study of pertuzumab,trastuzumab and eribulin mesylate (PTE) therapy for previously treated advancedHER2-positive breast cancer with analyses of quality of life and biomarkers. Ten patients were enrolled, two of whom had a history of docetaxel allergy. Themedian number of prior regimens was 3. The most common Grade 3 toxicities wereleukopenia (70%) and neutropenia (70%). Grade 4 or 5 adverse events were notobserved. An improving trend for the Functional Assessment of CancerTherapy-Breast (FACT-B) score at 3 months was observed. Eight cases were includedin the biomarker analysis. The peripheral CD8+ T cell/ CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory Tcells (Tregs) ratio was significantly increased (p = 0.039). The frequency ofperipheral Tregs was associated with the trastuzumab trough concentration (p =0.019). In a non-clinical analysis, Eribulin mesylate significantly inhibitedSer473 Akt phosphorylation in PIK3CA wild-type cells and mutated cells. Theseresults suggest that PTE therapy is a feasible and promising option for advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. Further investigation is warranted.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24504 PMCID: PMC5871086PMID: 29599915
