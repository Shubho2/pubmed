Electronic address:wcai@uwhealth.org.Mesoporous silica nanoshell (MSN) coating has been demonstrated as a versatilesurface modification strategy for various kinds of inorganic functionalnanoparticles, such as gold nanorods (GNRs), to achieve not only improvednanoparticle stability but also concomitant drug loading capability. However,limited drug loading capacity and low tumor accumulation rate in vivo are twomajor challenges for the biomedical applications of MSN-coated GNRs (GNR@MSN). Inthis study, by coating uniformly sized GNRs with MSN in an oil-water biphasereaction system, we have successfully synthesized a new bacteria-like GNR@MSN(i.e., bGNR@MSN) with a significantly enlarged pore size (4-8 nm) and surfacearea (470 m2/g). After PEGylation and highly efficient loading of doxorubicin(DOX, 40.9%, w/w), bGNR@MSN were used for positron emission tomography (PET, via facile and chelator-free 89Zr-labeling) and photoacoustic imaging-guidedchemo-photothermal cancer therapy in vivo. PET imaging showed that 89Zr-labeledbGNR@MSN(DOX)-PEG can passively target to the 4T1 murine breast cancer-bearingmice with high efficiency (∼10 %ID/g), based on enhanced permeability andretention effect. Significantly enhanced chemo-photothermal combination therapywas also achieved due to excellent photothermal effect andnear-infrared-light-triggered drug release by bGNR@MSN(DOX)-PEG at the tumorsite. The promising results indicate great potential of bGNR@MSN-PEGnanoplatforms for future cancer diagnosis and therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
