Early diagnosis is the key to improve survival rate incancer patients.Aims: In this paper an intelligent system is proposed to breast cancer tumor typerecognition.Settings and Design: The proposed system includes three main module: The feature selection module, the classifier module and the optimization module. Featureselection plays an important role in pattern recognition systems. The betterselection of features usually results in higher accuracy rate.Methods and Material: In the proposed system we used a new graph based featureselection approach to select the best features. In the classifier module, theradial basis function neural network (RBFNN)is used as classifier. In RBFtraining, the number of RBFs and their respective centers and widths (Spread)have very important role in its performance. Therefore, artificial bee colony(ABC) algorithm is proposed for selecting appropriate parameters of theclassifier.Statistical Analysis Used: The RBFNN with optimal structure and the selectedfeature classified the tumors with 99.59% accuracy.Results: The proposed system is tested on Wisconsin breast cancer database (WBCD)and the simulation results show that the recommended system exhibits a highaccuracy.Conclusions: The proposed system has a high recognition accuracy and therefore werecommend the proposed system for breast cancer tumor type recognition.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.183561 PMID: 29893330
