Here, weshow that ZIKV is also capable of infecting and destroying stem-like cancer cellsfrom aggressive human embryonal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). When evaluating the oncolytic properties of Brazilian Zika virus strain (ZIKVBR)against human breast, prostate, colorectal, and embryonal CNS tumor cell lines,we verified a selective infection of CNS tumor cells followed by massive tumorcell death. ZIKVBR was more efficient in destroying embryonal CNS tumorspheresthan normal stem cell neurospheres. A single intracerebroventricular injection ofZIKVBR in BALB/c nude mice bearing orthotopic human embryonal CNS tumorxenografts resulted in a significantly longer survival, decreased tumor burden,fewer metastasis, and complete remission in some animals. Tumor cells closelyresembling neural stem cells at the molecular level with activated Wnt signaling were more susceptible to the oncolytic effects of ZIKVBR Furthermore, modulation of Wnt signaling pathway significantly affected ZIKVBR-induced tumor cell deathand viral shedding. Altogether, these preclinical findings indicate that ZIKVBRcould be an efficient agent to treat aggressive forms of embryonal CNS tumors andcould provide mechanistic insights regarding its oncolytic effects.Significance: Brazilian Zika virus strain kills aggressive metastatic forms of human CNS tumorsand could be a potential oncolytic agent for cancer therapy.
