Accumulating evidences indicatethat transcription factor HOXB13 is of great significance in TAM resistance.However, the regulation of HOXB13 in TAM-resistant breast cancer remains largely unexplored. Here, we were interested in the potential effect of HBXIP, anoncoprotein involved in the acceleration of cancer progression, on the modulationof HOXB13 in TAM resistance of breast cancer.METHODS: The Kaplan-Meier plotter cancer database and GEO dataset were used toanalyze the association between HBXIP expression and relapse-free survival. Thecorrelation of HBXIP and HOXB13 in ER+ breast cancer was assessed by human tissuemicroarray. Immunoblotting analysis, qRT-PCR assay, immunofluorescence staining, Co-IP assay, ChIP assay, luciferase reporter gene assay, cell viability assay,and colony formation assay were performed to explore the possible molecularmechanism by which HBXIP modulates HOXB13. Cell viability assay, xenograft assay,and immunohistochemistry staining analysis were utilized to evaluate the effectof the HBXIP/HOXB13 axis on the facilitation of TAM resistance in vitro and invivo.RESULTS: The analysis of the Kaplan-Meier plotter and the GEO dataset showed thatmono-TAM-treated breast cancer patients with higher HBXIP expression levels hadshorter relapse-free survivals than patients with lower HBXIP expression levels. Overexpression of HBXIP induced TAM resistance in ER+ breast cancer cells. Thetissue microarray analysis revealed a positive association between the expressionlevels of HBXIP and HOXB13 in ER+ breast cancer patients. HBXIP elevated HOXB13protein level in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, HBXIP preventedchaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)-dependent degradation of HOXB13 viaenhancement of HOXB13 acetylation at the lysine 277 residue, causing theaccumulation of HOXB13. Moreover, HBXIP was able to act as a co-activator ofHOXB13 to stimulate interleukin (IL)-6 transcription in the promotion of TAMresistance. Interestingly, aspirin (ASA) suppressed the HBXIP/HOXB13 axis bydecreasing HBXIP expression, overcoming TAM resistance in vitro and in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that HBXIP enhances HOXB13 acetylation toprevent HOXB13 degradation and co-activates HOXB13 in the promotion of TAMresistance of breast cancer. Therapeutically, ASA can serve as a potentialcandidate for reversing TAM resistance by inhibiting HBXIP expression.DOI: 10.1186/s13045-018-0577-5 PMCID: PMC5824486PMID: 29471853
