Here, we aimed to investigate common features intamoxifen-resistant and radioresistant breast cancer, as tamoxifen-resistantbreast cancer cells are cross-resistant to irradiation in vitroExperimentalDesign: RNA sequencing of tamoxifen-resistant and radioresistant breast cancercells was performed and validated by quantitative PCR. Pathways were furtherinvestigated in vitro and in breast cancer patient cohorts to establish theirrelation with treatment resistance.Results: Both tamoxifen-resistant andradioresistant breast cancer cells had increased expression levels of genesinvolved in type I IFN signaling compared with nonresistant cells. IFN-stimulatedgenes (ISG) were induced in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner aftertamoxifen treatment and irradiation. Tamoxifen treatment also led to ssDNApresence in the cytoplasm, which is known to induce expression of ISGs, aphenomenon that has already been described for irradiation. Moreover, in a breastcancer patient cohort, high expression levels of ISGs were found in the primarytumor in around half of the patients. This was associated with atumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) expression signature, although the ISGs were also expressed by the tumor cells themselves. Importantly, the expression of ISGscorrelated with outcome in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifenor radiotherapy, but not in systemically untreated patients orchemotherapy-treated patients.Conclusions: Our data indicate that expression ofISGs by tumor cells is involved in acquired, treatment-induced resistance totamoxifen and radiotherapy, and might play a role in intrinsic resistance viainteraction with TILs.
