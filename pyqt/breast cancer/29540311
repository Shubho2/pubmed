Electronic address:franklin67@126.com.A series of 4-methylidene sterols including three new compounds 1-3, wereisolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei. The structures of newcompounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analyses. Compounds 3, 5,and 6 showed cytotoxicities against U937, MCF-7, and PC-9 cancer cells with IC50 in the range of 1.6-8.8 μM. The new compound 3 exhibited remarkable proapoptotic activity in breast cancer cells. Mechanically, 3 significantly triggered reactiveoxygen species (ROS) accumulation resulting in apoptosis and DNA damage in breastcancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
