We investigated Rbl2/p130 expression in connection to nucleosomepositions around its TSS among breast tumors and their adjacent normal controltissues (ANCT) using micrococcal nuclease (MNAse) digestion assay and ChIP-PCRanalysis. Three fold reduced Rbl2/p130 expression in these tumor tissues werenoticed compared to their control tissues. DNA obtained from MNAse digestedchromatin was used as PCR template. Region between - 137 to + 140 around TSS was scanned using 3 primer pairs (P1 = - 137 to + 69; P2 = - 90 to + 69; P3 = - 33 to+ 140). ~ 66% breast tumors and ~ 26% ANCT samples were positive for P1. Thedifference was found statistically significant (p = 0.000) with an odd ratio (OD)of 9.143, suggesting that nucleosome formation in this region is ~ 9 times moreprobable in tumor samples. ~ 73% of the tumor and 60% ANCT were positive for P2, which although is significant (p = 0.035) with OD = 3.250, but less preferablethan P1. However, P3 was not found to be a preferred area for nucleosomeoccupancy (p = 0.670; OD = 1.2). Negative correlations for nucleosome positionswere observed especially for P1. Our results indicate that nucleosome are presentslightly downstream of TSS in routine, while in case of breast carcinogenesisnucleosomes slides 55 bases upstream of the TSS, aligning + 1 position at thecenter of nucleosome, hence hindering access to the transcriptional machinery.DOI: 10.1007/s11033-018-4151-6 PMID: 29417345  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
