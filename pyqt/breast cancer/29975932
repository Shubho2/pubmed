However, cancer cellsusually develop mechanisms to evade cell death induced by chemotherapy. Thus,strategies are needed to reverse the chemoresistance of cancer cells.METHODS: We established cisplatin-resistant BC models in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 BC cell lines through long-term exposure to cisplatin. Quantitative reversetranscription PCR was used to examine the expression of microRNA (miR)-100. MTTcell viability assays were performed to determine cell viability. Regulation ofhematopoietic cell-specific protein 1-associated protein X-l (HAX-1) targeted by miR-100 was confirmed by western blotting and luciferase reporter assays. Themitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry.Release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, HAX-1expression, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were detected by westernblotting.RESULTS: A clear decrease in miR-100 expression was observed incisplatin-resistant MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (MDA-MB-231/R and MCF-7/R).Overexpression of miR-100 increased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231/R and MCF-7/Rcells to cisplatin treatment and promoted cisplatin-induced mitochondrialapoptosis by targeting HAX-1 gene.CONCLUSIONS: MiR-100 targeted HAX-1 to increase the chemosensitivity of BC bymediating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
