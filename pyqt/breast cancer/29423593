Recent research hasimplicated tumor inflammation as a promoter of metastasis. Myeloid, lymphoid, andmesenchymal cells in the tumor microenvironment promote inflammatory signalingamongst each other and together with cancer cells to modulate sustainedinflammation, which may enhance cancer invasiveness. Tumor hypoxia, a state ofreduced available oxygen present in the majority of solid tumors, acts as aprognostic factor for a worse outcome and is known to have a role in tumorinflammation through the regulation of inflammatory mediator signals in bothcancer and neighboring cells in the microenvironment. Multiple methods to target tumor hypoxia have been developed and tested in clinical trials, and still moreare emerging as the impacts of hypoxia become better understood. These strategiesinclude mechanistic inhibition of the hypoxia inducible factor signaling pathway and hypoxia activated pro-drugs, leading to both anti-tumor and anti-inflammatoryeffects. This prompts a need for further research on the prevention ofhypoxia-mediated inflammation in cancer. Hypoxia-targeting strategies seem tohave the most potential for therapeutic benefit when combined with traditionalchemotherapy agents. This paper will serve to summarize the role of theinflammatory response in metastasis, to discuss how hypoxia can enable or enhanceinflammatory signaling, and to review established and emerging strategies totarget the hypoxia-inflammation-metastasis axis.DOI: 10.1007/s11523-018-0555-4 PMID: 29423593
