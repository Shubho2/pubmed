However few data are present onthe concordance between AR expression in primary tumors and metastases. Weinvestigated AR expression by using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 164 primarytumors and 83 metastases, to explore its distribution in the different tumorsubtypes and its concordance between the two sample types and according tosampling time. AR was more highly expressed in luminal A and B than HER2-positiveand triple negative primary tumors. A similar distribution was found inmetastases, and the concordance of AR expression between primary tumors andmetastases was greater than 60%. No association between sampling time and ARexpression was observed. We found a good concordance of AR expression betweenprimary tumor and metastasis, but the variability remains high between the twotypes of specimens, regardless of the variation in sampling time. For thisreason, if used for treatment decisions, AR evaluation should be repeated in eachpatient whenever a new biopsy is performed, as commonly done for the other breastcancer biomarkers.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
