We report a case of metaplastic squamous cell carcinoma of thebreast diagnosed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NAC). A 56-year-old woman wasdiagnosed as having right-sided breast cancer(invasive ductal carcinoma[IDC],triple negative), cT1cN1M0, stage II A. NAC with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide(FEC)followed by docetaxel(DTX)was administered. Tumorprogression occurred during both the FEC and DTX regimens. We discontinued NACand performed breast conserving surgery with axillary lymph node dissection.Histological findings of the resected specimen showed mixed IDC and widely spreadsquamous metaplasia. Weekly paclitaxel and radiotherapy were administered and thepatient is alive with no recurrence 3 years after surgery.PMID: 30042281
