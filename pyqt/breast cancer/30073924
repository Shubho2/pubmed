Therefore, administeringanti-inflammatory medication in cancer therapy seems to be justified. A potentialpathway associated with the aforementioned issue is cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition, particularly as the overexpression of this enzyme has been proven to occur incancer tissues and is also associated with a poor prognosis in several types ofhuman malignancies. Celecoxib, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, has been utilized forover 20 years, particularly as an anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyreticmedication. However, to date, its antineoplastic properties have not beensufficiently investigated. In recent years, the number of research studies on theantineoplastic effects of celecoxib has increased considerably. The vast majorityof publications refer to preclinical studies attempting to elucidate itsmechanisms of action. Clinical trials concerning celecoxib have focused primarilyon the treatment of cancers of the colon, breast, lung, prostate, stomach, headand neck, as well as premalignant lesions such as familial adenoma polyposis. In this review, article authors attempt to summarise the latest research which haselucidated celecoxib use in the treatment and prevention of cancer.CONCLUSION: Both preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated promisingresults of the role of celecoxib in the treatment and prevention of cancer - the best outcome was observed in colon, breast, prostate and head and neck cancers.However, more clinical trials providing real evidence-based clinical advances of celecoxib use are needed.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1389450119666180803121737 PMID: 30073924
