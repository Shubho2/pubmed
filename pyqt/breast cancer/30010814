Here, we provide evidencethat surface Trop-2 expression is functionally connected with an epithelialphenotype in breast and prostate cell lines and in patient tumor samples. Wefurther show that Trop-2 expression is suppressed epigenetically or through theaction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition transcription factors and thatderegulation of Trop-2 expression is linked with cancer progression and poorpatient prognosis. Moreover, our data suggest that the cancer plasticity-drivenintratumoral heterogeneity in Trop-2 expression may significantly contribute toresponse and resistance to therapies targeting Trop-2-expressing cells.DOI: 10.1093/carcin/bgy095 PMID: 30010814
