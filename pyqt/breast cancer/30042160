[Epub ahead of print]Does measurement of 18F-fluoride metabolic flux improve response assessment ofbreast cancer bone metastases compared with standardised uptake values in18F-fluoride PET/CT?Azad G(1), Siddique MM(1), Taylor B(2), Green A(3), O'Doherty J(4), Gariani J(5),Blake GM(1), Mansi J(2), Goh V(1), Cook GJR(1).Author information: (1)King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital, United Kingdom.(2)Guys and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom.(3)King's College London, United Kingdom.(4)King's College London & Guy's and St Thomas' PET Centre, St Thomas' Hospital.(5)Geneva University Hospitals, Switzerland.Purpose: To establish whether non-invasive measurement of changes in 18F-fluoridemetabolic flux to bone mineral (Ki) by positron emission tomography/ computedtomography (PET/CT) can provide incremental value in response assessment of bone metastases in breast cancer compared to maximum and mean standardized uptakevalues (SUVmax, SUVmean). Methods: Twelve breast cancer patients startingendocrine treatment for de-novo or progressive bone metastases were included.Static 18F-fluoride PET/CT scans were acquired 60 minutes post-injection, before and 8 weeks after commencing treatment. Venous blood samples were taken at 55 and85 minutes post-injection to measure plasma 18F-fluoride activity concentrations.This allowed calculation of Ki in individual bone metastases using a previouslyvalidated method. Percentage changes in Ki, SUVmax and SUVmean were calculatedfrom the same ≤ 5 index lesions from each patient. Clinical response up to 24weeks, assessed in consensus by two experienced oncologists blinded to PETimaging findings, was used as a reference standard. Results: In the 4 patientswith clinical progressive disease (PD), mean Ki significantly increased (>25%) inall, SUVmax in 3 and SUVmean in 2. In the 8 non-PD patients, Ki decreased orremained stable in 7, SUVmax in 5 and SUVmean in 6. A significant mean percentageincrease in Ki from baseline occurred in the 4 patients with PD compared withSUVmax and SUVmean (89.7% vs 41.9% and 43.8%, respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion:After 8 weeks of endocrine treatment for bone-predominant metastatic breastcancer, Ki more reliably differentiated PD from non-PD than SUVmax and SUVmean,probably because measurement of SUVs underestimates fluoride clearance as changesin input function are not accounted for.Copyright © 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.208710 PMID: 30042160
