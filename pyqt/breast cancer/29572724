We estimated the cost effectiveness of BRCA mutation testing in early-stage breast cancer patients with high pre-test probability ofharbouring the mutation in Malaysia, an LMIC in Asia.METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model to estimate the lifetime costsand quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accrued through BRCA mutation testing or routine clinical surveillance (RCS) for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 early-stagebreast cancer patients aged 40 years. In the model, patients would decide whetherto accept testing and to undertake risk-reducing mastectomy, oophorectomy,tamoxifen, combinations or neither. We calculated the incrementalcost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the health system perspective. A series ofsensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS: In the base case, testing generated 11.2 QALYs over the lifetime andcost US$4815 per patient whereas RCS generated 11.1 QALYs and cost US$4574 perpatient. The ICER of US$2725/QALY was below the cost-effective thresholds. TheICER was sensitive to the discounting of cost, cost of BRCA mutation testing and utility of being risk-free, but the ICERs remained below the thresholds.Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a threshold of US$9500/QALY,99.9% of simulations favoured BRCA mutation testing over RCS.CONCLUSIONS: Offering BRCA mutation testing to early-stage breast cancer patientsidentified using a locally-validated risk-assessment tool may be cost effectivecompared to RCS in Malaysia.DOI: 10.1007/s40258-018-0384-8 PMID: 29572724
