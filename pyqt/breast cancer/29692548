Epub 2018 Mar 16.Extraction, profiling and bioactivity analysis of volatile glucosinolates presentin oil extract of Brassica juncea var. raya.Bassan P(1), Bhushan S(1), Kaur T(1), Arora R(2), Arora S(1), Vig AP(1).Author information: (1)1Department of Botanical and Environmental Sciences, Guru Nanak DevUniversity, Amritsar, Punjab 143005 India.(2)2Department of Biochemistry, Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciencesand Research, Amritsar, Punjab 143501 India.Cruciferous vegetables are rich source of glucosinolates (GSLs), which inpresence of myrosinase enzyme cause hydrolytic cleavage and result in differenthydrolytic products like isothiocyanates, thiocyanates, nitriles and epinitriles.The GSLs hydrolytic products are volatile compounds, which are known to exhibitbioactivities like antioxidant, fungicidal, bioherbicidal and anticancer. Amongthe Brassicaceae family, Brassica juncea is very well known for high content ofGSLs. In the present study, the isolation of volatile oil of B. juncea var. raya was done by hydrodistillation method using clevenger apparatus and further there extraction was done by solvents ethyl acetate and dichloromethane. The volatilecompounds present in the extract were analysed by gas chromatography/gaschromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/GC-MS). Fatty acid esters, sulphur and/ornitrogen compounds, carbonyl compounds and some other volatile compounds werealso identified. Besides the analytical studies, the extracts were analysed fortheir bioactivities including radical scavenging activity by using DNA nickingassay and cytotoxic effect using different human cancer cell lines viz. breast(MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), prostate (PC-3), lung (A-549), cervix (HeLa) and colon(HCT116) by MTT assay. The oil extracts were efficiently able to reduce theincrease of cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Among all cell lines, themost effective anticancer activity was observed in case of breast (MCF-7) cancer cell line. So, MCF-7 cells were used for further mechanistic studies foranalysing the mechanism of anticancer activity. Confocal microscopy was done for analysing morphological changes in the cells and the images confirmed thefeatures typical of apoptosis. For evaluating the mode of cell death,spectrofluorometric determination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) andmitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was done. The volatile oil extract treatedMCF-7 cells had a significant increase in number of ROS, also there was a rise inpercentage of cells with increased disruption of MMP. So, the present study marksnecessary indication that B. juncea (raya) oil extracts significantly inducesapoptosis in all the above mentioned cancer cells lines through a ROS-mediatedmitochondrial pathway and thus play a remarkable role in death of cancer cells.DOI: 10.1007/s12298-018-0509-4 PMCID: PMC5911257 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29692548
