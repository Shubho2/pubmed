In an attempt to search for itspotential substrates other than nucleobases in this study, we could successfully find urate, a metabolic derivative of purine nucleobases, as a novel substrate,as indicated by its specific Na+ -dependent and saturable transport, with aMichaelis constant of 433 μmol/L, by rat SNBT1 (rSNBT1) stably expressed inMadin-Darby canine kidney II cells. However, urate uptake was observed onlybarely in the everted tissue sacs of the rat small intestine, in which rSNBT1operates for nucleobase uptake. These findings suggested that urate undergoes afutile cycle, in which urate transported into epithelial cells is immediatelyeffluxed back by urate efflux transporters, in the small intestine. In subsequentattempts to examine that possibility, such a futile urate cycle was demonstrated in the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line as a model cell system, where urateuptake induced by transiently introduced rSNBT1 was extensively reduced by theco-introduction of rat breast cancer resistance protein (rBCRP), a urate effluxtransporter present in the small intestine. However, urate uptake was not raised in the presence of Ko143, a BCRP inhibitor, in the everted intestinal tissuesacs, suggesting that some other transporter might also be involved in urateefflux. The newly found urate transport function of SNBT1, together with thesuggested futile urate cycle in the small intestine, should be of interest forits evolutional and biological implications, although SNBT1 is geneticallydeficient in humans.© 2018 The Authors.
