This clearly supports the need forupdating the 2008 WHO (World Health Organization) classification ofhaematopoietic and lymphoid tumours. The 2017 WHO classification is not a newedition but an update and revision of the 4th edition. New provisional entitiesbut not new definitive entities are included, and novel molecular data in most ofthe entities and changes in the nomenclature in few of them have beenincorporated. In the context of the mature T- and NK-cell neoplasms, the mostrelevant updates concern to: 1-dysregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway due to gene mutations which are common to various aggressive and indolent neoplasms;2-incorporation of new molecular players that are relevant to the pathogenesis ofthese neoplasms and/or have prognostic implications; 3-inclusion of newprovisional entities within the subgroups of anaplastic, primarily intestinal andcutaneous lymphomas such as breast implant-associated anaplastic large celllymphoma, indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the gastrointestinaltract and primary cutaneous acral CD8+ T-cell lymphoma; 4-identification of poor prognostic subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphomas not otherwise specified (PTCL,NOS) characterized by overexpression of certain genes and of a subgroup PTCL, NOSwith a T follicular phenotype that now is included together withangioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma under the umbrella of lymphomas with a Tfollicular helper phenotype; and 5-refinement on the designation and definitionof already established entities. A review of the major changes will be outlined.Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ijlh.12817 PMID: 29741263
