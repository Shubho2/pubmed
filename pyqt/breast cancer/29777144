Regional anesthesia during mastectomy may offer the prevention ofpostoperative pain. One potential protocol is the combination of serratusanterior plane block (SAM block) with pectoral nerve block I (PECS I), but theresults and potential benefits are limited. Our study compared general anesthesiawith or without SAM block + PECS I during radical mastectomy with axillary nodedissection and breast reconstruction using evaluations of pain, opioidconsumption, side effects and serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 andIL-10. This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Fifty patients wererandomized to general anesthesia only or general anesthesia associated with SAMblock + PECS I (25 per group). The association of SAM block + PECS I with generalanesthesia reduced intraoperative fentanyl consumption, morphine use and visualanalog pain scale scores in the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) and at 24 hafter surgery. In addition, the anesthetic protocol decreased side effects andsedation 24 h after surgery compared to patients who underwent general anesthesiaonly. IL-6 levels increased after the surgery compared to baseline levels in bothgroups, and no differences in IL-10 and IL-1 beta levels were observed. Ourprotocol improved the outcomes of mastectomy, which highlight the importance ofimproving mastectomy protocols and focusing on the benefits of regionalanesthesia.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-26273-z PMCID: PMC5959858PMID: 29777144
