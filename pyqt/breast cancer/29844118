Although many of these mechanisms have been discovered, itremains a challenge to understand how they interact to render an individual cell line sensitive or resistant to a particular drug. To better understand thisvariability, we profiled a panel of 30 breast cancer cell lines in the absence ofdrugs for their mutations, copy number aberrations, mRNA, protein expression and protein phosphorylation, and for response to seven different kinase inhibitors.We then constructed a knowledge-based, Bayesian computational model thatintegrates these data types and estimates the relative contribution of variousdrug sensitivity mechanisms. The resulting model of regulatory signalingexplained the majority of the variability observed in drug response. The modelalso identified cell lines with an unexplained response, and for these wesearched for novel explanatory factors. Among others, we found that 4E-BP1protein expression, and not just the extent of phosphorylation, was a determinantof mTOR inhibitor sensitivity. We validated this finding experimentally and foundthat overexpression of 4E-BP1 in cell lines that normally possess low levels ofthis protein is sufficient to increase mTOR inhibitor sensitivity. Takentogether, our work demonstrates that combining experimental characterization withintegrative modeling can be used to systematically test and extend ourunderstanding of the variability in anticancer drug response.Significance: Byestimating how different oncogenic mutations and drug resistance mechanismsaffect the response of cancer cells to kinase inhibitors, we can betterunderstand and ultimately predict response to these anticancer drugs.GraphicalAbstract:http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/15/4396/F1.large.jpg CancerRes; 78(15); 4396-410. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-2698 PMID: 29844118
