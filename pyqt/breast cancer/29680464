Although they represent a rare entity,their incidence may increase in the coming years owing to conservative approachconsidered in the treatment of breast cancer. The aim of this work was tohighlight the effect of postoperative irradiation in the treatment of thesetumours.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted at the Mohammed-VIcentre for cancer treatment between 2004 and 2011. Survival rates were calculatedby the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: Fifteen cases were collected. The median age was 41.9years. Phyllodesarcoma accounted for 66% of this series. Surgical treatment was performed in 93%of the patients with negative margins in 33.33% of the cases. Neoadjuvantchemotherapy was indicated in 46% of the patients with locally advanced tumoursand 66% of the patients received postoperative radiotherapy for positive or closemargins. Five years overall survival and relapse free survival was notsignificantly different with the use of adjuvant radiotherapy.CONCLUSION: Due to the rarity of this entity and the absence of randomizedtrials, evidence based management is still lacking. However, a multidisciplinary approach is to be required including surgical excision followed by radiotherapy, depending on the tumour characteristics.Copyright © 2018 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO).
