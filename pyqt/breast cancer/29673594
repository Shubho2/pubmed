In order to better understand the mechanism of lincRNA-ROR in TNBC,we provided a novel molecular target into the regulatory invasion and metastasis in present research. We found that lincRNA-ROR was upregulated in TNBC cell linesand tissue samples. The aberrant expression of lincRNA-ROR was shown to increase invasion and metastasis in MDA-MB-231 and loss of function by siRNA reverse theseprocess. Furthermore, lincRNA-ROR functions as a competing endogenous RNAs(ceRNA) which sponges miR-145 and therefore upregulate the expression of Mucin1(MUC1). The expression of MUC1 impacted E-cadherin membrane localization.Together, MUC1 was a potential molecular target may help explain the role oflincRNA-ROR/miR-145 for invasion and metastasis in TNBC cell lines.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
