Recent studies show that dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) playan important role in metastasis and chemoresistance development in breast cancer.Herein, we identified downregulated expression of miR-708-3p in breast cancers.In particular, miR-708-3p expression was significantly decreased in specimensfrom breast cancer patients with metastasis compared to that in specimens frompatients with no metastasis. Consistent with clinical data, our in vitro datashow that miR-708-3p was more significantly decreased in invasive breast cancercell lines. In addition, our data show that inhibition of miR-708-3psignificantly stimulated breast cancer cell metastasis and inducedchemoresistance both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, overexpression ofmiR-708-3p dramatically inhibited breast cancer cell metastasis and enhanced the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to chemotherapy both in vitro and in vivo.Furthermore, we identified that miR-708-3p inhibits breast cancer cellepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by directly targeting EMT activators, including ZEB1, CDH2 and vimentin. Taken together, our findings suggest thatmiR-708-3p acts as a cancer suppressor miRNA and carries out its anticancerfunction by inhibiting EMT in breast cancer. In addition, our findings suggestthat restoration of miR-708-3p may be a novel strategy for inhibiting breastcancer metastasis and overcoming the chemoresistance of breast cancer cells.© 2018 The Authors.
