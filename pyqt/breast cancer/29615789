However, themechanisms that control the interaction between metabolic reprogramming andtranscriptional regulation remain unclear. Here we show that the metabolic enzyme6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4) regulatestranscriptional reprogramming by activating the oncogenic steroid receptorcoactivator-3 (SRC-3). We used a kinome-wide RNA interference-based screeningmethod to identify potential kinases that modulate the intrinsic SRC-3transcriptional response. PFKFB4, a regulatory enzyme that synthesizes a potentstimulator of glycolysis 2 , isÂ found to be a robust stimulator of SRC-3 thatcoregulates oestrogen receptor. PFKFB4 phosphorylates SRC-3 at serine 857 andenhances its transcriptional activity, whereas either suppression of PFKFB4 orectopic expression of a phosphorylation-deficient Ser857Ala mutant SRC-3abolishes the SRC-3-mediated transcriptional output. Functionally, PFKFB4-driven SRC-3 activation drives glucose flux towards the pentose phosphate pathway andenables purine synthesis by transcriptionally upregulating the expression of the enzyme transketolase. In addition, the two enzymes adenosine monophosphatedeaminase-1 (AMPD1) and xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), which are involved inpurine metabolism, were identified as SRC-3 targets that may or may not bedirectly involved in purine synthesis. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of SRC-3 at Ser857 increases its interaction with the transcription factor ATF4 bystabilizing the recruitment of SRC-3 and ATF4 to target gene promoters. Ablation of SRC-3 or PFKFB4 suppresses breast tumour growth in mice and preventsmetastasis to the lung from an orthotopic setting, as does Ser857Ala-mutantSRC-3. PFKFB4 and phosphorylated SRC-3 levels are increased and correlate inoestrogen receptor-positive tumours, whereas, in patients with the basal subtype,PFKFB4 and SRC-3 drive a common protein signature that correlates with the poorsurvival of patients with breast cancer. These findings suggest that the Warburg pathway enzyme PFKFB4 acts as a molecular fulcrum that couples sugar metabolismto transcriptional activation by stimulating SRC-3 to promote aggressivemetastatic tumours.DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0018-1 PMCID: PMC5895503 [Available on 2018-10-03]PMID: 29615789
