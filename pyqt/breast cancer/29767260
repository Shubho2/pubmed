China.Asparaginase like 1 (ASRGL1) protein belongs to the N‑terminal nucleophile group,cleaving the isoaspartyl‑dipeptides and L‑asparagine by adding water. It tends tobe overexpressed in cancerous tumors including ovarian cancer and breast tumors. The present study assessed the potential ability of ASRGL1 as a molecular target in gene‑based cervical cancer treatment. The protein expression level of ASRGL1was determined in paraffin‑embedded tumor specimen by immunohistochemistry.Additionally, in order to assess the activity of ASRGL1 during the process ofcervical cancer cell multiplication, ASRGL1‑short hairpin (sh) RNA‑expressinglentivirus was established, which was used to infect SiHa cells. The CellomicsArrayScan VT1 Reader identified the influence of downregulation on SiHa caused byRNA interference‑intervened ASRGL1. Flow cytometric analysis was also performedto evaluate the influence. The cyclin dependent kinase (CDK2), cyclin A2, B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) and Bcl‑2‑associated X protein (Bax) expression levels wereassessed by western blot analysis. ASRGL1 was observed to be overexpressed incervical cancer tissues when compared with the adjacent normal tissues. Theknockdown of ASRGL1 in SiHa by ASRGL1‑shRNA lentivirus infection significantlyinhibited cell growth and enhanced cellular apoptosis; the cells were alsocaptured during the S phase. The knockdown of ASRGL1 expression led to theincreased expression of Bax and decreased expression of Bcl‑2, CDK2 and cyclinA2. In conclusion, ASRGL1 was closely associated with growth and apoptosis incervical cancer. Therefore, ASRGL1 may be a novel, potentially effectiveanti‑cervical cancer therapy.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9018 PMCID: PMC6059725PMID: 29767260
