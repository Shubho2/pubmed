This study aimed to investigate the effects of microRNA-625-3p(miR-625-3p) on thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion andapoptosis, as well as underlying potential mechanism.METHODS: The relative expressions of miR-625-3p in tumor tissues and adjacentnormal tissues of 20 patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) were assessedusing qRT-PCR. Cell transfection was used to up-regulate or down-regulate theexpressions of miR-625-3p in thyroid cancer SW579 and TPC-1 cells. Effects ofmiR-625-3p overexpression or suppression on SW579 and TPC-1 cell viability,migration, invasion and apoptosis were detected respectively. The regulatoryeffect of miR-625-3p on astrocyte elevated gene 1 (AEG-1) expression was alsoanalyzed. Then, the roles of AEG-1 in SW579 and TPC-1 cell proliferation,migration, invasion and apoptosis, as well as Wnt/β-catenin and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways activation, were evaluated.RESULTS: miR-625-3p had high expressions in tumor tissues, compared to adjacentnormal tissues. Overexpression of miR-625-3p significantly promoted SW579 andTPC-1 cell proliferation, migration and invasion but had no influence on cellapoptosis. Knockdown of miR-625-3p had opposite effects, but induced cellapoptosis. AEG-1 was up-regulated by miR-625-3p overexpression and participatedin the effects of miR-625-3p on SW-579 and TPC-1 cells. In addition,overexpression of AEG-1 induced the activation of Wnt/β-catenin and JNK pathways in SW579 and TPC-1 cells.CONCLUSION: miR-625-3p promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells by enhancing the expression of AEG-1 and activating downstreamWnt/β-catenin and JNK pathways.Copyright © 2018.
