It has recently emerged thatdifferent metabolic pathways support metastatic breast cancer. To further uncovermetabolic pathways enabling breast cancer metastasis, we investigated metabolicdifferences in mouse tumors of differing metastatic propensities using massspectrometry-based metabolomics. We found that sialic acid metabolism isupregulated in highly metastatic breast tumors. Knocking out a key gene in sialicacid metabolism, Cmas, inhibits synthesis of the activated form of sialic acid,cytidine monophosphate-sialic acid and decreases the formation of lung metastasesin vivo. Thus, the sialic acid pathway may be a new target against metastaticbreast cancer.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00174 PMCID: PMC5985449PMID: 29892572
