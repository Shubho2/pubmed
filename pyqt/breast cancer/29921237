Zoledronic acid (ZA) has been proven to inhibit angiogenesis, invasion, andadhesion of tumor cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the potentialof monoclonal antibody against T cell checkpoint PD-1 in combination withchemotherapeutic drug ZA in BC mouse model.METHODS: The 4Â T1-fLuc mouse BC model was used in this study. The anti-tumorefficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody alone or in combination with ZA was monitored bymeasuring bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and tumor volume. At the end of study,the flow cytometry was used to determine the immune cell population in tumorsafter different treatment.RESULTS: The results showed that mice treated with the combination therapy ofanti-PD-1 antibody plus ZA exhibited better antitumor response compared tountreated controls or single therapy with no obvious toxicity.CONCLUSION: Our study provides preclinical evidence for the enhanced BC treatmentbenefit through targeting co-signal molecules by combining anti-PD-1 antibodyplus ZA treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4412-8 PMCID: PMC6009040PMID: 29921237
