It is wellknown that complex and combined gene regulation of multi-omics is involved in theoccurrence and development of breast cancer.RESULTS: In this paper, we present the Multi-Omics Breast Cancer Database(MOBCdb), a simple and easily accessible repository that integrates genomic,transcriptomic, epigenomic, clinical, and drug response data of differentsubtypes of breast cancer. MOBCdb allows users to retrieve simple nucleotidevariation (SNV), gene expression, microRNA expression, DNA methylation, andspecific drug response data by various search fashions. The genome-wide browser/navigation facility in MOBCdb provides an interface for visualizing multi-omics data of multi-samples simultaneously. Furthermore, the survival module providessurvival analysis for all or some of the samples by using data of three omics.The approved public drugs with genetic variations on breast cancer are alsoincluded in MOBCdb.CONCLUSION: In summary, MOBCdb provides users a unique web interface to theintegrated multi-omics data of different subtypes of breast cancer, which enablesthe users to identify potential novel biomarkers for precision medicine.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4708-z PMID: 29429018
