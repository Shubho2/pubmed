Theaim of this study was to investigate the expression of p16 and SATB1 proteins in regard to expression of the Ki-67 antigen and available clinicopathological data (i.a. receptor status, staging and grading).MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed on 130 samples of archivedinvasive ductal breast cancers. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed onfreshly prepared tissue microarrays and subsequently scanned by a histologicscanner. Reactions were evaluated separately in the cytoplasm (p16c, SATB1c) and nucleus (p16n, SATB1n, Ki-67) with use of a quantification software underresearcher supervision.RESULTS: Expression was observed for Ki-67 in 100%, p16c in 90%, p16n in 89.2%,SATB1c in 98.5% and SATB1n in 87.7% of cancer cases. Statistical analysis showed strong positive correlations: p16c vs. p16n and SATB1c vs. SATB1n (p<0.001 forboth) and weak positive correlations: p16c vs. SATB1c and p16c vs. SATB1n(p=0.008, p=0.027; respectively). Expression of p16n was stronger in G1 vs. G2(p=0.034) while Ki-67 expression was stronger in cases with negative progesteronereceptor status (p=0.011). All other analyzed associations were statisticallyinsignificant.CONCLUSION: A weak association between immunohistochemical expression of p16 and SATB1 indicated limited possibility of their independent usage. Further studiesconcerning determination of a wider panel of proteins controlling cell cycleshould be considered.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11301 PMID: 29936452
