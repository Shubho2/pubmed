Radix Glycyrrhiza (RG) has been broadly used for itsanti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic effects. However, the mechanisms ofregulation of iNOS in inflammation and cancer have not been fully explored. Totalflavonoids isolated from RG (TFRG) exhibited anti-inflammatory activity throughthe regulation of ERK/NF-κB/miR-155 signaling and suppression of iNOS expression in LPS/IFN-γ stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages without cytotoxicity. TFRG alsomarkedly reduced tumor mass of breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 xenografts withsuppression of iNOS expression, formation of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), andinactivation of protumorigenic JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. These resultssuggested that TFRG limited the development of breast cancer and inflammation dueto its property of iNOS inhibition.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6714282 PMCID: PMC5987298PMID: 29951107
