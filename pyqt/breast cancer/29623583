STIC was diagnosedin 3 (0.8%) patients; one of them underwent surgical staging due to positiveperitoneal washing, with absence of disease at the final pathology report. Noneof the three patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and were free of disease at last follow-up. Fallopian tube and ovarian carcinoma were diagnosed in 5 (1.4%)and 1 (0.3%), respectively. At a median (range) follow-up time of 29 (3-92)months, five patients had a newly diagnosed breast cancer. Other types of cancer,which were diagnosed during the follow-up time, included: serous primaryperitoneal carcinoma (n = 1), serous endometrial carcinoma (n = 1), colon(n = 1), pancreas (n = 1), jaw (n = 1), and lymphoma (n = 1). Seven patients dieddue to different types of cancer: breast (n = 4), pancreas (n = 1), jaw (n = 1), and colon (n = 1).CONCLUSION: The incidence of STIC after RRSO in BRCA mutation carriers is low(0.8%) and it presents an excellent oncological outcome. Patients after RRSO,however, run the risk to develop other types of cancer during follow-up andshould be properly advised before the prophylactic surgery.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1865-9 PMID: 29623583
