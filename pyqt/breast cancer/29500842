Randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of CBT compared witha range of comparators in cancer survivors. We assessed the effect of CBT byusing the standardized mean difference as effect size.RESULTS: Among 1289 abstracts and 292 full-text articles reviewed, 10 studieswere included. At the posttreatment period, the pooled effect size for CBT on QOLwas 0.57 (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.69; P < .001), on depression was -1.11 (95% CI, -1.28to -0.94; P < .001), on stress was -0.40 (95% CI, -0.53 to -0.26; P < .001), onanxiety was -1.10 (95% CI, -1.27 to -0.93; P < .001), and on hyperarousal clusterof symptoms was -0.18 (95% CI, -0.30 to -0.05; P < .001). The QOL was considered statistically medium effect sizes. The depression and anxiety were consideredstatistically large effect sizes.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavior therapy is an effective therapy for psychologicalsymptoms of cancer survivors and patients, with meaningfully clinical effectsizes. These findings suggested that CBT should be used as the intervention forbreast cancer survivors and patients when possible.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4687 PMID: 29500842
