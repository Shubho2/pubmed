Like basal-likebreast cancers, basal-like MIBCs are associated with advanced stage andmetastatic disease. However, the biological and clinical significance ofmolecular subtypes of MIBCs remain unclear. Therefore, we implemented a seriousof bioinformatics methods to explore genetic similarities between bladder andbreast cancers.METHODS AND RESULTS: In the current study, by the application of multiple levels data analysis including random forest analysis, PPI and transcription factorregulation network construction, Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichmentanalysis, we explored the genetics commonness between MIBC and breast cancersfrom the molecular heterogeneity based on the disease subtypes.CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified some basal-related and luminal-related genesshared by two cancers. These studies can help shed light on the potentialrelationships between MIBC and breast cancer as a whole.DOI: 10.3233/THC-174699 PMCID: PMC6027900PMID: 29758961
