It is a distinct entity unrelated to radiation-induced fibrosis of thebreast.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between the years 2005-2016, approximately 12,000 breastcancer cases were treated with surgery and radiation in the central district ofIsrael. From that population, we have identified and managed the cases of breast RIM by a multidisciplinary team of dermatologists, breast surgeons, and plasticsurgeons. Demographic, oncologic, diagnostic and treatment data were collectedand reviewed.RESULTS: Three cases of breast radiation-induced morphea, with an estimatedprevalence of 1:3000 cases of post-breast cancer radiation where identified. The first signs of morphea appeared years after the completion of standard RT. Early management leads to superior cosmetic results.CONCLUSIONS: Unfortunately, there are no known predictors for RIM. Earlyrecognition by the oncologist, the breast surgeon or the reconstructive surgeonduring follow-up enables expeditious provision of patient reassurance and helpsguide potential treatment options.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
