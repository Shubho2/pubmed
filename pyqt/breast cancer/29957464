The developmental profiles of cancer in women can vary by genetic markers and cellular events. In turn, age and lifestyleinfluence in the cellular response and also on the cancer progression andrelapse. The human DEK protein, a histone chaperone, belongs to a specificsubclass of chromatin topology modulators, being involved in the regulation ofDNA-dependent processes. These epigenetic mechanisms have dynamic and reversible nature, have been proposed as targets for different treatment approaches,especially in tumor therapy. The expression patterns of DEK vary between healthy and cancer cells. High expression of DEK is associated with poor prognosis inmany cancer types, suggesting that DEK takes part in oncogenic activities viadifferent molecular pathways, including inhibition of senescence and apoptosis.The focus of this review was to highlight the role of the DEK protein in thesetwo female cancers.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
