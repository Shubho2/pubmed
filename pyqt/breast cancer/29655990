Nevertheless, the therapeutic potential of TRAZ is often limiteddue to its frequent resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. Therefore, we investigatethe reversal effect of STAT3-specific decoy oligonucleotides (STAT3-decoy ODNs)on TRAZ resistance, which contain the consensus sequence within the targeted genepromoter of STAT3. Considering the shortcomings of poor cellular permeability andrapid degradation in vivo limit the further clinical applications of ODNs, wereport here an asymmetric hybrid lipid/polymer vesicles with calcium phosphate asthe solid kernel (CaP@HA). Through hyaluronan-mediated CD44 targeting, theconstructed vesicles can specifically carry STAT3-decoy ODNs into TRAZ-resistant breast cancer cells and then regulate TRAZ-induced apoptosis. In comparison with the native ones, ODNs packaged with CaP@HA showed significantly increased serumstability, cellular transfection, synergistic cytotoxicity and apoptosis invitro. The improved TRAZ sensitization is attributed to the blockade of STAT3signaling as well as the expression of downstream target genes associated withTRAZ resistance. With the synergistic action of STAT3-decoy ODNs loaded CaP@HA,TRAZ inhibited the growth of its resistant breast cancer xenograft dramaticallyand induced significant tumor cell apoptosis in vivo. These results suggestedthat CaP@HA mediated targeted delivery of STAT3-decoy ODNs might be a promisingnew strategy to overcome anti-HER2 resistance in breast cancer therapy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
