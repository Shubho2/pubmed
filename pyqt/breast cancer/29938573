Breast tumors deficient inBRCA1 are mostly associated with basal-like breast cancers and targetedtherapeutics for this disease subtype are still lacking. In order to addresswhether macroautophagy/autophagy inhibition will be effective in BRCA1-deficient mammary tumors, we generated mice with conditional deletion of an essentialautophagy gene, Rb1cc1, along with Brca1 and Trp53, through utilization of theK14-Cre transgene. We found that Rb1cc1 deletion suppressed tumorigenesis in the BRCA1-deficient model when compared to wild type and heterozygous Rb1cc1controls. However, in contrast to previous studies in the mouse mammary tumorvirus (MMTV)-polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) model, tumor growth and thedistribution of histological subtypes were not affected by loss of RB1CC1.Interestingly, loss of RB1CC1 decreased mitochondrial mass and oxidativerespiratory capacity of these tumor cells, along with a decrease in thephosphorylation of MTOR substrates and transcript levels of genes involved inmitochondrial biogenesis. Importantly, we observed an increased sensitivity tomitochondrial disrupting agents upon loss of RB1CC1. Consequently, our datashowed that combination of an autophagy inhibitor, spautin-1, along with amitochondrial complex I inhibitor, metformin, was more effective in limitingoxidative respiratory capacity, colony-forming ability and tumor growth.Altogether, our results indicate that inhibition of autophagy can increase thebenefits of metformin treatment in BRCA1-deficient breast cancers.DOI: 10.1080/15548627.2018.1460010 PMID: 29938573
