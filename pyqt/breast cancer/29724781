Previous studies have implicated ASM in the induction ofthe chemokine CCL5 in response to TNF-α however, the lipid mediator of thiseffect was not established. In the present study, we identified a novel pathwayconnecting ASM and ceramide kinase (CERK). The results show that TNF-α inducesthe formation of ceramide 1-phosphate (C-1-P) in a CERK-dependent manner.Silencing of CERK blocks CCL5 production in response to TNF-α. Interestingly,cells lacking ASM have decreased C-1-P production following TNF-α treatment,suggesting that ASM may be acting upstream of CERK. Functionally, ASM and CERKinduce a highly concordant program of cytokine production and both are requiredfor migration of breast cancer cells. Taken together, these data suggest ASM can produce ceramide which is then converted to C-1-P by CERK, and that C-1-P isrequired for production of CCL5 and several cytokines and chemokines, with roles in cell migration. These results highlight the diversity in action of ASM throughmore than one bioactive sphingolipid.Copyright © 2018 Newcomb et al.DOI: 10.1194/jlr.M084202 PMCID: PMC6027921 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29724781
