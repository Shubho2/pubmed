In this study, we investigated genomic alterations in LSCC andevaluated the clinical implications of mutation burden (MB) in LSCC.METHODS: Genomic alterations were determined in Japanese patients with LSCC(N = 67) using next-generation sequencing of 415 known cancer genes. MB wasdefined as the number of non-synonymous mutations per 1 Mbp. Programmeddeath-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein expression in cancer cells was evaluated byimmunohistochemical analysis.RESULTS: TP53 gene mutations were the most common alteration (n = 51/67, 76.1%), followed by gene alterations in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B;35.8%), CDKN2A (31.3%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (30.0%), andsex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2, 28.3%). Histological differentiation wassignificantly poorer in tumors with high MB (greater than or equal to the median MB) compared with that in tumors with low MB (less than the median MB; p =0.0446). The high MB group had more tumors located in the upper or middle lobethan tumors located in the lower lobe (p = 0.0019). Moreover, cancers in theupper or middle lobes had significantly higher MB than cancers in the lower lobes(p = 0.0005), and tended to show higher PD-L1 protein expression (p = 0.0573).SOX2 and tyrosine kinase non-receptor 2 amplifications were associated with high MB (p = 0.0065 and p = 0.0010, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The MB level differed according to the tumor location in LSCC,suggesting that the location of cancer development may influence the genomicbackground of the tumor.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6401-1 PMID: 29500766
