Beyond these conventional APCs,immune stimulatory cells have been more recently shown to extend to a class ofatypical APCs, composed of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. Here, wedescribe a unique type of APC, Gr1-/low CD11b-/low cells with a granularity andsize characteristic of myeloid cells and with the ability to present Ag forcrosspresentation. These cells constitutively express MHCII and the costimulatorymolecules, CD80, CD86, and CD40. They do not express pan markers of myeloid DCs(CD11c), plasmacytoid DCs (Ly6C), or macrophages (F4/80), and their frequency is inversely correlated with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) intumor-bearing mice. Among splenocytes, they are more abundant than DCs andmacrophages, and they exhibit antitumor immune stimulatory function at a steadystate without further activation, ex vivo. They are also found within the tumorbed where they retain their immune stimulatory function. Our findings suggest theuse of these novel APCs in additional preclinical studies to further investigate their utility in APC-based cancer immunotherapies.Â©2018 Society for Leukocyte Biology.DOI: 10.1002/JLB.5A0717-276RR PMID: 29985529
