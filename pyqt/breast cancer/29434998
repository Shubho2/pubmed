China.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a type of small non-coding RNA molecule that performs animportant role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Since miRNAs were firstidentified in 1993, a number of studies have demonstrated that they act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in human cancer, including colorectal, lung, brain,breast and liver cancer, and leukemia. Large high-throughput studies havepreviously revealed that miRNA profiling is critical for the diagnosis andprognosis of patients with cancer, while certain miRNAs possess the potential to be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets in cancer.The present study reviews the studies and examines the roles of miRNAs in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, and discusses the potential therapeuticmodality of exploiting miRNAs.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7638 PMCID: PMC5778870PMID: 29434998
