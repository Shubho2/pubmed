Radisky, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.Purpose Women with atypical hyperplasia (AH) on breast biopsy have an aggregateincreased risk of breast cancer (BC), but existing risk prediction models do not provide accurate individualized estimates of risk in this subset of high-riskwomen. Here, we used the Mayo benign breast disease cohort to develop andvalidate a model of BC risk prediction that is specifically for women with AH,which we have designated as AH-BC. Patients and Methods Retrospective cohorts of women age 18 to 85 years with pathologically confirmed benign AH from Rochester, MN, and Nashville, TN, were used for model development and external validation,respectively. Clinical risk factors and histologic features of the tissue biopsy were selected using L1-penalized Cox proportional hazards regression. Identified features were included in a Fine and Gray regression model to estimate BC risk,with death as a competing risk. Model discrimination and calibration wereassessed in the model-building set and an external validation set. Results Themodel-building set consisted of 699 women with AH, 142 of whom developed BC(median follow-up, 8.1 years), and the external validation set consisted of 461women with 114 later BC events (median follow-up, 11.4 years). The final AH-BCmodel included three covariates: age at biopsy, age at biopsy squared, and numberof foci of AH. At 10 years, the AH-BC model demonstrated good discrimination(0.63 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.70]) and calibration (0.87 [95% CI, 0.66 to 1.24]). Inthe external validation set, the model showed acceptable discrimination (0.59[95% CI, 0.51 to 0.67]) and calibration (0.91 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.42]). ConclusionWe have created a new model with which to refine BC risk prediction for womenwith AH. The AH-BC model demonstrates good discrimination and calibration, and itvalidates in an external data set.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.75.9480 PMCID: PMC6008107 [Available on 2019-06-20]PMID: 29676945
