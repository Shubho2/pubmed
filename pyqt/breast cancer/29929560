Dosimetric benefits of A-DIBHwere investigated in the treatment of left-sided breast cancer radiotherapy (RT) with both 3-Dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) andintensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques.METHODS: Twenty-two patients with left-sided breast cancer were enrolled in this study. 3D-CRT and IMRT plans were generated for each patient with three differentCT scans of free breathing (FB), T-DIBH and A-DIBH. There were total of sixtreatment plans generated for each patient: FB_3D-CRT; TDIBH_3D-CRT;ADIBH_3D-CRT; FB-IMRT; TDIBH-IMRT; ADIBH-IMRT. Doses to the heart, left anterior descending coronary artery (LADCA), and ipsilateral lung were evaluated andcompared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.RESULTS: The mean doses to the heart, LADCA and ipsilateral lung in 3D-CRT plans generated from 3D-CRT with FB, T-DIBH and A-DIBH were (2.89 ± 1.30),(1.67 ± 0.90) and (1.34 ± 0.43) Gy (all P < 0.05), respectively, with FB;(29.08 ± 16.72), (13.94 ± 14.74) and (10.22 ± 10.30) Gy (all P < 0.05),respectively, with T-DIBH; and (7.77 ± 2.71), (7.32 ± 1.42) and (6.90 ± 1.60) Gy (all P < 0.05), respectively, with A-DIBH. The mean doses to the heart, LADCA andipsilateral lung in IMRT plans were generated from IMRT with FB, T-DIBH andA-DIBH were (1.96 ± 2.25), (1.37 ± 0.44) and (1.18 ± 0.26) Gy (all P < 0.05),respectively, with FB; (16.10 ± 7.45), (8.6 ± 6.60) and (7.35 ± 5.42) Gy (allP < 0.05), respectively, with T-DIBH; and (5.90 ± 2.24), (5.65 ± 1.58) and(5.62 ± 1.05) Gy (all P > 0.05), respectively, with A-DIBH.CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that both 3D-CRT and IMRT plans with A-DIBHachieved lower cardiac and LADCA doses than plans with FB and T-DIBH; 3D-CRTplans with A-DIBH achieved lower ipsilateral lung doses than plans with FB andT-DIBH; and IMRT plans with A-DIBH had better outcomes than 3D-CRT plans withA-DIBH with respect to the mean dose to the heart, LADCA and ipsilateral lung.IMRT plans with A-DIBH should be incorporated into the daily routine forleft-sided breast RT.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-1062-6 PMCID: PMC6013896PMID: 29929560
