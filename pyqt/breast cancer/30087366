Here we show that MED1, a Mediator subunit in theMiddle module of Mediator complex, is overexpressed in breast cancer and is anegative prognostic factor. The levels of several miRNAs (miR-100-5p, -191-5p,-193b-3p, -205-5p, -326, -422a and -425-5p) were found to be regulated by MED1.MED1 induces miR-191/425 cluster in an estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) dependentmanner. Occupancy of MED1 on estrogen response elements (EREs) upstream ofmiR-191/425 cluster is estrogen and ER-α-dependent and ER-α-induced expression ofthese miRNAs is MED1-dependent. MED1 mediates induction of cell proliferation andmigration and the genes associated with it (JUN, FOS, EGFR, VEGF, MMP1, andERBB4) in breast cancer, which is abrogated when used together withmiR-191-inhibition. Additionally, we show that MED1 also regulates the levels of direct miR-191 target genes such as SATB1, CDK6 and BDNF. Overall, the resultsshow that MED1/ER-α/miR-191 axis promotes breast cancer cell proliferation andmigration and may serve as a novel target for therapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29546-9 PMID: 30087366
