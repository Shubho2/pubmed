The size,drug loading content, and encapsulation efficiency of PTX loaded micelles were20-30 nm, 7.5%, 82.5%, respectively. PTX loaded PELA-PBAE micelles could enhance the intracellular uptake of a model drug significantly, with increasedcytotoxicity and inhibition of tumor metastasis on 4T1 cells, as confirmed bywound healing assay and tumor cells invasion assay. The expression of metastasis and apoptosis correlated proteins on 4T1 cells decreased remarkably afterintervention by PTX loaded polymer micelles, as demonstrated by western blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptional-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Ourresults demonstrated the pH responsive polymer micelles might have the potential to be used in the treatment of metastatic breast tumors.DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00543 PMCID: PMC5974204PMID: 29875669
