However, studies focused on its involvement in breast cancerremain controversial, and no study has taken the interaction betweeninterleukin-18 (IL-18) gene polymorphism and body mass index (BMI), menopauseinto consideration. The study investigated the association between IL-18-137,-607 polymorphisms and risk of breast cancer and a possible interaction betweenthe 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and BMI, menopause in Chinese Hanwoman.METHODS: A total of 488 participants, including 178 patients with breast cancer, 150 patients with benign breast disease and 160 healthy controls were recruitedfor this study. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-direct sequencing technology was used to identify the genotypes.RESULTS: 137 G/C genotype can decrease the risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31-0.93; P = .025). In benign group, subjects with G/C genotype ofIL-18-137G/C polymorphism had a 1.89-fold increased risk of developing breastcancer (95% CI = 1.05-3.41; P = .032). Among postmenopausal subjects, people withG/T genotype of IL-18-607 polymorphism had a 7.97-fold increased risk of lymphnode metastasis compared with those with T/T homozygotes (95% CI = 1.95-32.65;P = .0045). Among Overweight and obese patients with breast cancer (BMI ≥ 24),people with G/T genotype of IL-18-607 polymorphism had a 5.45-fold increased riskof lymph node metastasis compared with those with T/T homozygotes (95%CI = 1.74-17.06; P = .034).CONCLUSIONS: IL-18-137 G/C genotype may be a protective factor for healthy group,but a risk factor for benign group. IL-18-607 G/T genotype have an interactionwith menopausal and BMI. The synergetic effect can further increase the risk oflymph node metastasis for breast cancer patients.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcla.22591 PMID: 29926984
