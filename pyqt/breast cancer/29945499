In real-world applications, wesometimes have a limited training set in a target task while we have auxiliarydata from a related task. To obtain a better prediction performance in the targettask, supervised learning requires a sufficiently large training set in thetarget task to perform well in predicting future test examples of the targettask. In this paper, we propose a TL approach for cancer drug sensitivityprediction, where our approach combines three techniques. First, we shift therepresentation of a subset of examples from auxiliary data of a related task to arepresentation closer to a target training set of a target task. Second, we alignthe shifted representation of the selected examples of the auxiliary data to the target training set to obtain examples with representation aligned to the target training set. Third, we train machine learning algorithms using both the targettraining set and the aligned examples. We evaluate the performance of ourapproach against baseline approaches using the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) on real clinical trial datasets pertaining tomultiple myeloma, nonsmall cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, andbreast cancer. Experimental results show that our approach is better than thebaseline approaches in terms of performance and statistical significance.DOI: 10.1142/S0219720018400140 PMID: 29945499
