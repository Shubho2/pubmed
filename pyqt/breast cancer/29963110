This study was designed to evaluate the efficiency andsafety of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell immunotherapy, following regularchemotherapy, for patients with TNBC.Methods: A total of 340 patients with postmastectomy TNBC, from January 1, 2010to June 30, 2014, were included in this retrospective study. Seventy-sevenpatients received CIK cell immunotherapy, following regular chemotherapy (arm 1),and 263 patients received regular chemotherapy alone (arm 2). The primary aim wasoverall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and the treatmentresponses and adverse events were also evaluated.Results: The 5-year DFS and OS rates in arm 1 were 77.9% and 94.3%, compared with69.8% and 85.6% in arm 2, respectively (p=0.159 and p=0.035, respectively). This clearly shows that there was no statistical difference in the 5-year DFS between the two groups. Multivariate analyses of arm 1 indicated that a Karnofskyperformance score (KPS) ≥90 and stage I/IIA disease were significantly associatedwith a prolonged DFS period (hazard ratio [HR], 0.25; 95% confidence interval[CI], 0.09-0.74; p=0.012; and HR 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.82; p=0.024, respectively),but a KPS ≥90 and stage I/IIA disease were not independent prognostic factors forOS. Toxicity was mild in patients who received the CIK therapy.Conclusion: The data suggested that CIK cell immunotherapy improved theefficiency of regular chemotherapy in patients with TNBC, and the side effects ofCIK cell immunotherapy were mild.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.150 PMCID: PMC6015982PMID: 29963110
