Articles reporting on HRQLusing EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-BR23, FACT-G and FACT-B questionnaires in Asianpatients with breast cancer were eligible for inclusion. The methodologicalquality of each article was assessed using the quality assessment scale forcross-sectional studies or the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale forcohort studies.RESULTS: Fifty-seven articles were selected for this qualitative synthesis, ofwhich 43 (75%) were cross-sectional and 14 (25%) were longitudinal studies. Over 75 different determinants of HRQL were studied with either the EORTC or FACTquestionnaires. Patients with comorbidities, treated with chemotherapy, with lesssocial support and with more unmet needs have poorer HRQL. HRQL improves overtime. Discordant results in studies were found in the association of age, maritalstatus, household income, type of surgery, radiotherapy and hormone therapy andunmet sexuality needs with poor global health status or overall well-being.CONCLUSIONS: In Asia, patients with breast cancer, in particular those with othercomorbidities and those treated with chemotherapy, with less social support andwith more unmet needs, have poorer HRQL. Appropriate social support and meetingthe needs of patients may improve patients' HRQL.Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
