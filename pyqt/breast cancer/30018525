Echocardiography with LVEF measurement was performed beforeadjuvant RT (LVEF0) and after the completed treatment (LVEF1,). After thetreatment NT-proBNP measurement was done as well. The difference (Δ) betweenLVEF0 and LVEF1 was analysed (Δ LVEF = LVEF0 - LVEF1) and compared between thetwo groups.Results: There were 84 patients in the left and 91 in the right breast cancergroup. Median observation time was 57 (37-71) months. Mean Δ LVEF (%) was -1.786%in the left and -2.607% in the right breast cancer group (p = 0.562, CI: -2.004to 3.648). Median NT-proBNP were 111.0 ng/l in the left and 90.0 ng/l in theright breast cancer group (p = 0.545). Echocardiography showed that the patients in the left breast cancer group did not have significantly worse systolic anddiastolic left ventricular function in comparison with the patients in the right breast cancer group, but, they had higher incidence of pericardial effusion (9[11%] vs. 1 [1%]) (p = 0.007).Conclusions: We did not find any significant differences in the early parameters of cardiotoxicity (LVEF, NT-proBNP) between the observed groups. Patients whoreceived left breast/chest wall irradiation had higher incidence of pericardialeffusion.DOI: 10.2478/raon-2018-0011 PMCID: PMC6043887PMID: 30018525
