There is an urgent need to seek an appropriate pharmacokineticparameter of PTX to improve treatment efficacy and reduce adverse effects.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of pharmacokinetic parameter TC > 0.05 of paclitaxel (PTX) and its therapeutic efficacy and toxicity in patients with solidtumors.METHODS: A total of 295 patients with ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer, breastcancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who were admitted to the TumorHospital of Shantou University Medical College, China, were recruited for thisstudy. Patients received 3 weeks of PTX chemotherapy. The plasma concentrationsof PTX were examined using the MyPaclitaxel™ kit. The patients' PTX TC > 0.05(the time during which PTX plasma concentration exceed 0.05µmol/L) werecalculated based on pharmacokinetic analysis.RESULTS: The results showed that: (1) the concentrations of PTX in these 295patients ranged from 0.0358-0.127 µmol/L; (2) the PTX TC > 0.05 ranged from 14 to38h with a median time of 27h; (3) among all treatment cycles, there was astatistically significant difference in the PTX TC > 0.05 between CR+PR andSD+PD; (4) with the increasing value of TC > 0.05, level of leukopenia andleukopenic fever increased; (5) high PTX TC > 0.05 led to the occurrence ofneutropenia, neutropenic fever, severe anemia, and severe peripheralneurotoxicity. Taken together, our results indicated that the pharmacokineticparameter PTX TC > 0.05 was an effective measure of treatment efficacy andtoxicity in patients with solid tumors. Maintaining PTX TC > 0.05 at 26 to 30hcould improve its efficacy and reduce the incidence of leukopenia, neutropenia,anemia, and peripheral neurotoxicity in these patients.CONCLUSION: PTX TC > 0.05 is a key pharmacokinetic parameter of PTX which should be monitored to optimize individual treatment in patients with solid tumors.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1574892813666180305170439 PMID: 29512471
