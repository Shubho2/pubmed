Y. Patil Biotechnology &Bioinformatics Institute, Dr. D. Y. Patil Vidyapeeth, Pune, Maharashtra. India.Tumor heterogeneity within various cancer types including breast carcinoma ispivotal in the manifestations of tumor hallmarks. Tumor heterogeneity is seen as a common landscape where intra-tumoral components including cellular andnon-cellular factors create interface with outside environment that lead to theunique identity of a specific cancer type. Among various contributors to tumorheterogeneity, cellular heterogeneity immensely plays a role in drug resistanceand relapse of cancer. Within cellular heterogeneity of tumor, tumor-associatedmacrophages (TAMs) are pro-tumor type of immune cells that promote growth,metastasis and drug resistance in breast carcinoma and other cancer types.Revealing the molecular aspects of TAMs can provide a breakthrough to removetherapeutics blockade to existing drugs and these understanding in future pavethe way a new class of cancer immunotherapeutic. This review addresses currentunderstanding on the role of TAMs in breast carcinoma hallmarks and clarifies thecurrent scenario on pre-clinical drugs directed to tame pro-cancer TAMs.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1568009618666180628102247 PMID: 29952260
