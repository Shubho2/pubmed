For further elucidation of the mechanism, a culture system mimicking the microenvironment of the tumor in humans was needed. We established a model ofmicroencapsulated SGC7901 human GC cells and evaluated the effects of coculturingspheres with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). SGC7901 cells were encapsulatedin alginate-polylysine-sodium alginate (APA) microcapsules using an electrostaticdroplet generator. MTT assays showed that the numbers of microencapsulated cells were the highest after culturing for 14 days. Metabolic curves showed consumptionof glucose and production of lactic acid by day 20. Immunocytochemistry confirmedthat Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and Vascular Endothelial GrowthFactor (VEGF) were expressed in microencapsulated SGC7901 cells on days 7 and 14.The expression of PCNA was observed outside spheroids; however, VEGF was found inthe entire spheroids. PCNA and VEGF were increased after being cocultured withTAMs. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)expressions were detected in the supernatant of microencapsulated cellscocultured with TAMs but not in microencapsulated cells. Our study confirms thesuccessful establishment of the microencapsulated GC cells. TAMs can promotePCNA, VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expressions of the GC cells.DOI: 10.1155/2018/3767482 PMCID: PMC5902114PMID: 29808160
