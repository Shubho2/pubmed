The majority of these studies are on European populations, withlimited SNP association data in other populations. We genotyped 51GWAS-identified SNPs in two independent cohorts of Singaporean Chinese. Cohort 1 comprised 1294 BC cases and 885 controls and was used to determine odds ratios(ORs); Cohort 2 had 301 BC cases and 243 controls for deriving polygenic riskscores (PRS). After age-adjustment, 11 SNPs were found to be significantlyassociated with BC risk. Five SNPs were present in <1% of Cohort 1 and wereexcluded from further PRS analysis. To assess the cumulative effect of theremaining 46 SNPs on BC risk, we generated three PRS models: Model-1 included 46 SNPs; Model-2 included 11 statistically significant SNPs; and Model-3 includedthe SNPs in Model-2 but excluded SNPs that were in strong linkage disequilibrium with the others. Across Models-1, -2 and -3, women in the highest PRS quartilehad the greatest ORs of 1.894 (95% CI = 1.157-3.100), 2.013 (95% CI =1.227-3.302) and 1.751 (95% CI = 1.073-2.856) respectively, suggesting a directcorrelation between PRS and BC risk. Given the potential of PRS in BC riskstratification, our findings suggest the need to tailor the selection of SNPs to be included in an ethnic-specific PRS model.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24374 PMCID: PMC5849174PMID: 29560110
