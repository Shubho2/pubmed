While GLDCpromotes tumor initiation and proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer andglioma and it was reported as a putative tumor suppressor gene in gastric cancer,the role of GLDC in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. In the currentstudy, microarray-based analysis suggested that GLDC expression was low in highlymalignant HCC cell lines, and clinicopathological analysis revealed a decrease inGLDC in HCC tumor samples. While the knockdown of GLDC enhanced cancer cellmigration and invasion, GLDC overexpression inhibited them. Mechanistic studiesrevealed that GLDC knockdown increased the levels of reactive oxygen species(ROS) and decreased the ratio of glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG),which in turn dampened the ubiquitination of cofilin, a key regulator of actinpolymerization. Consequently, the protein level of cofilin was elevated, whichaccounted for the increase in cell migration. The overexpression of GLDC reversedthe phenotype. Treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine decreased the protein level of cofilin while treatment with H2O2 increased it, further confirming the role ofROS in regulating cofilin degradation. In a tumor xenographic transplant nudemouse model, the knockdown of GLDC promoted intrahepatic metastasis of HCC while GLDC overexpression inhibited it. Our data indicate that GLDC downregulationdecreases ROS-mediated ubiquitination of cofilin to enhance HCC progression andintrahepatic metastasis.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
