In terms of crude incidencefor CHF, AC followed by T showed the highest incidence (6.3%). However, 3.1 and4.2% of the patients had CHF due to AC-based chemotherapy and non-AC followed by T, respectively. The median times to occurrence of CHF were different accordingto adjuvant treatments, approximately 2 years (701.0 days) in the AC-basedchemotherapy group vs 1 year (377.5 days) AC followed by T group. T therapy wasassociated with earlier development of CHF irrespective of previous chemotherapy,but late risk of CHF 1.2 years after T therapy rapidly decreased in bothchemotherapy groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that theadjusted hazard ratio for CHF was increased in the group of older patients(≥ 65 years old) who underwent AC followed by T therapy, with Charlsoncomorbidity index scores of ≥ 2.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that neo-/adjuvant chemotherapy using Tirrespective of previous chemotherapy (AC or non-AC) was associated withsignificantly increased risk of CHF compared with AC-based chemotherapy in Koreanpatients with early breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4809-8 PMID: 29737474
