In natural habitats the essential oils compounds may play important roles in the protection of the plants as antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, insecticidesand also against herbivores by reducing their appetite for such plants or byrepelling undesirable others. We analyzed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometrythe chemical composition of the essential oil of aerial parts of Glandorarosmarinifolia (Ten.) D.C. Thomas obtained by hydrodistillation and verified somebiological activities on a panel of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines(HA22T/VGH, HepG2, Hep3B) and triple negative breast cancer cell lines (SUM 149, MDA-MB-231). In the essential oil we detected 35 compounds. The results of thebiological assays indicate that essential oil of G. rosmarinifolia induces cellgrowth inhibition at concentration-dependent way in all cell line models. Thisoil does not seem to possess antioxidant activity, while the cytotoxicity of G.rosmarinifolia essential oil appeared to involve, at least in part, a pro-oxidantmechanism. Our results show for the first time the antitumoral and pro-oxidantactivities of G. rosmarinifolia essential oil and suggest that it may represent aresource of pharmacologically active compounds.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196947 PMCID: PMC5933692PMID: 29723282  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
