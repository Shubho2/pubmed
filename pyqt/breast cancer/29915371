However, whether ICTS has anticancer activities against GC is unknown. In the present study, wereported that the proliferation of GC cells was inhibited by ICTS in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After treatment with ICTS, GC cells were arrested in theG1/G0 phase of cell cycle and the apoptotic cells were induced in adose-dependent manner. Additionally, ICTS suppressed the expression of cellcycle- and apoptosis-associated proteins (e.g., Cyclin D1, phosphorylated Rb,E2F1, Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Survivin). ICTS inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 ina dose-dependent manner. Down-regulated STAT3 attenuated the expression of CyclinD1, p-Rb, and Survivin, which remarkably increased the sensitivity of ICTS in GC cells; overexpression of STAT3 restored the cell growth and proliferation and theprotein expression suppressed by ICTS. ICTS also suppressed the xenograft tumorgrowth in BALB/c nude mice. Together, these data indicate that ICTS inhibits GCproliferation by inducing G1/G0 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via inhibitingthe STAT3 signaling pathway.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-27638-0 PMCID: PMC6006307PMID: 29915371
