Epub 2018 Jul 24.Activity of Eribulin Mesylate in Brain Metastasis from Breast Cancer: A Stone in a Pond?Catania G, Malaguti P, Gasparro S, Cognetti F, Vidiri A, Fabi A.BACKGROUND: Brain metastases develop in approximately 10-25% of patients withmetastatic breast cancer (MBC) and are associated with a very poor prognosis.CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 40-year-old woman with MBC and associatedlung, bone, liver, and brain metastases, who experienced a time to progression ofseveral months with eribulin after whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), 2 lines ofchemotherapy, and 1 line of hormonal therapy, maintaining a good toxicityprofile.DISCUSSION: Eribulin, in association with local treatment such as WBRT, can bewell tolerated and effective in achieving a long progression-free survival and a good control of brain metastases in patients with MBC who have received multiple lines of treatment. The vascular remodeling properties of eribulin, combined withbrain radiotherapy, might facilitate the passage of eribulin across the bloodbrain barrier, improving brain response.CONCLUSION: Our anecdotal experience suggests that eribulin may have apotentially beneficial effect on brain metastases while maintaining a goodsystemic control of the disease in patients with MBC.Â© 2018 S.
