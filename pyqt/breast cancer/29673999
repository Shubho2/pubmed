Electronic address:martina.ceckova@faf.cuni.cz.Ribociclib is a novel cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 selective inhibitorthat recently gained breakthrough therapy status and global approval for advancedbreast cancer treatment. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters may become asite of severe drug interactions and a mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR)development. With respect to rapid progress of ribociclib in the clinical field, we aimed to identify its interactions with ABC transporters and cytochrome P450(CYP) isoenzymes and evaluate its potential to overcome transporter-mediated MDR using established in vitro methods. Our data showed accelerated ABCB1 inhibitorLY335979-sensitive, basolateral-to-apical transport of ribociclib acrossMDCKII-ABCB1 cell monolayers, which identified ribociclib as an ABCB1 substrate. The antiproliferative studies supported this finding by demonstratingsignificantly higher EC50 value in ABCB1-, but not ABCG2- or ABCC1-expressingMDCKII cells, than in the parent MDCKII cell line. Furthermore, we observedsignificant inhibitory effects of ribociclib on ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters and CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C9 isoform activity in human CYP-expressinginsect microsomes. The ribociclib-induced ABCB1 and ABCG2 inhibition furtherreversed daunorubicin and mitoxantrone resistance in MDCKII and human MCF-7breast carcinoma cell lines, indicating a synergistic antiproliferative effect,without affecting ABCB1 or ABCG2 expression. In summary, our data indicate thatABCB1 affects ribociclib transport across the membranes and the high potential ofribociclib for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) through ABCB1 and ABCG2 transportersand CYP isoforms. Moreover, we demonstrate the beneficial MDR-reversing potentialof ribociclib, which could be further exploited in novel anticancer treatmentstrategies.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
