Little is knownabout this rare neoplasm as the current literature offers only some case reports or a few number of small series. The aim of our study is to provide someclinicopathologic features of the breast tubular adenoma. We retrospectivelyanalyzed at our department of pathology all cases of breast tubular adenomasconfirmed by immunohistochemistry over a period of 9 years (2009-2017). Ninecases of breast tubular adenoma have been recorded, with an average age of31.44 years. Five tumors were located at the right side (55.55%), and most cases had suspicious aspects on imaging techniques (6 cases out of 9). The diagnosishas been made on 5 resected specimens (lumpectomy) and on 4 core needle biopsies.The tumor size ranged from 0.9 to 7 cm (mean size of 3.08 cm) and hadwell-circumscribed margins with elastic consistency. The histopathologic analysisshowed a typical pattern of proliferating round and uniform tubules lined byregular epithelial cells surrounded by myoepithelial cells, packed in a smallamount of stroma, highlighted by CD34 immunostaining. Tubular adenoma is a rarebreast benign neoplasm of young premenopausal women. The radiologic aspects areoften worrisome and only the histopathologic analysis can achieve the correctdefinitive diagnosis by excluding all potential differential diagnoses.DOI: 10.1177/1179555718757499 PMCID: PMC5808954PMID: 29449780
