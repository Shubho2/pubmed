Electronic address:elbadrygroupresearch@gmail.com.New imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives were designed, synthesized and screenedfor their anticancer activity against breast (MCF-7) and colon (HCT116) cancercell lines. Nine compounds (I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, VI, VIIa, VIII, IX) showedsignificant activity against MCF-7, while six compounds (I, VIIc, VIIe, VIIf,VIII, IX) elicited a remarkable activity against HCT116. Compounds showingsignificant anticancer activity revealed remarkable CDK9 inhibitory potential(IC50 = 0.63-1.32 μM) relative to sorafenib (IC50 = 0.76 μM). Moreover, amolecular docking study was performed to illustrate the binding mode of the most active compounds in the active site of CDK9 where it revealed superior bindingaffinity relative to the natural ligand (T3C).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
