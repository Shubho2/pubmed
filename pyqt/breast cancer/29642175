She had previously, undergone whole-brain radiation therapy.Paclitaxel, platinum, UTD1, capecitabine, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, andsingle-agent apatinib were then administered as first- to fifth-line therapies.She exhibited progression each time after a short period of diseasestabilization.DIAGNOSES: Triple-negative breast cancer.INTERVENTIONS: The patient chose treatment with apatinib+CPT-11+S-1 as thesixth-line therapy.OUTCOMES: A remarkable response of the brain, and lung metastases, andalleviation of the brain edema were achieved, and these effects persisted for 7months.LESSONS: We describe the significant anti-tumor effect of apatinib + CPT-11 + S-1against BMs from breast cancer. This report is the first to suggest potentialapproaches to BM treatment using this scheme and describes the effects of anapatinib-containing regimen on BMs.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010349 PMCID: PMC5908627PMID: 29642175  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
