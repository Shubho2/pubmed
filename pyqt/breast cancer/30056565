We, herein,investigated the biological and clinical significance of RAPH1 in breast cancerusing large annotated cohorts.METHODS: The clinicopathological and prognostic significance of RAPH1 wasassessed at the genomic and transcriptomic levels using The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) dataset (n = 1039) and the results were validated using the Moleculartaxonomy of breast cancer international consortium (METABRIC) cohort (n = 1980). RAPH1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a large,well-characterised cohort of early-stage breast cancer (n = 1040).RESULTS: In both the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts, RAPH1 mRNA expression and RAPH1copy number alteration were strongly correlated. RAPH1 mRNA overexpression wassignificantly correlated with high expression of adhesion and EMT markersincluding CDH1, TGFβ1 and CD44. RAPH1 mRNA overexpression was a significantpredictor of a poor prognosis (Hazard ratio 3.88; p = 0.049). High RAPH1 protein expression was associated with higher grade tumours with high proliferationindex, triple negative phenotype and high E-cadherin expression. High RAPH1protein expression was an independent predictor of shorter survival (Hazard ratio4.37; p = 0.037).CONCLUSIONS: High RAPH1 expression is correlated with aggressive breast cancerphenotypes and provides independent prognostic value in invasive breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4891-y PMID: 30056565
