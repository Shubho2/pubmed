AfterRadiomics feature number reduction, 3 of 6 (50%) selected features differedbetween controls and cancers (Skewness (0.002); Entropy (p.004); 90percentile(p.006)). Three Radiomics features (Energy, Entropy and Dissimilarity)significantly correlated to tumor size (r = -0.15,r = 0.49,r = 0.51), but notwith prognostic factors. Entropy correlated with Estrogen Receptor status(r = -0,46; p.004).CONCLUSION: Radiomics features in patients with dense breasts and negativemammography appear to differ between cancerous and normal breast tissue, withevidence of correlation with tumor size and estrogen receptors. This newinformation warrants further evaluation in larger studies and could contribute toimproved understanding of breast cancer through imaging, and may support tailoredscreening and treatments.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
