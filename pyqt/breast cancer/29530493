Cognitive assessment was conductedthrough personal and family interview, and the Montreal cognitive assessment(MoCA). Functional, physical, nutritional, social support, comorbidity assessmentand medication review were conducted.ANALYSIS: Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia were comparedto patients who were cognitively intact.RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-two patients underwent geriatric assessment, mean(±SD) age was 78 ± 7 years, 121 (63%) had some degree of neurocognitive deficit, with 64 patients (33%) presenting with major neurocognitive deficit (dementia),and 57 cases (30%), minor neurocognitive deficit (MCI). Early stage dementia was evident in 50% of cases, moderate stage in 32%, and severe stage in 18%. Theprevalence of dementia and MCI were higher than in the general population studies(70-79 years). Associated factors for neurocognitive deficits as compared toolder patients with cancer with normal cognition, included a higher comorbidityindex (p = 0.04), stroke (p = 0.03), metastatic disease (p = 0.04), and warfarin use (p = 0.03).CONCLUSION: Neurocognitive deficits (MCI and dementia) are more common in olderadults with cancer. Factors associated with neurocognitive deficits include high comorbidity, stroke, warfarin use and metastatic cancer. Identification andmanagement of these conditions is of great relevance in the course of cancertherapy.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.DOI: 10.1016/j.jgo.2018.02.010 PMID: 29530493
