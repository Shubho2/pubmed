Methods include randomized controlled clinicaltrials (RCT) supplemented with basic science, population and observational dataas needed. The barrier to use of progesterone is lack of awareness that safetyconcerns with estrogen-including 'menopausal hormone therapy' (MHT) are notapplicable to progesterone. In a single 3-month RCT, progesterone (300 mg atbedtime) was effective treatment of VMS in 133 healthy menopausal women. Itcaused an overall 55% VMS decrease, no withdrawal-related VMS rebound and agreater VMS decrease in 46 women with ≥50 moderate-intense VMS/week. Progesteroneis equally or more effective than estradiol in improving cardiovascularendothelial function and caused no cardiovascular safety concerns in a 3-monthRCT. An 8-year prospective cohort study (E3N) in more than 80 000 menopausalwomen showed progesterone prevented breast cancer in estrogen-treated women.Multiple RCTs confirm that progesterone (300 mg daily at bedtime) does not cause depression and improves deep sleep. In conclusion, progesterone effectivelytreats VMS, improves sleep and may be the only therapy that symptomatic women,who are menopausal at a normal age and without osteoporosis, need.DOI: 10.1080/13697137.2018.1472567 PMID: 29962247
