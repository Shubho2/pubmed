A female patient underwent multigene panel testing because of apersonal history of invasive LBC diagnosed at age 54, which identified thegermline CDH1 nonsense alteration, c.2506G>T (p.Glu836*), in the last exon of thegene. Subsequent parental testing for the alteration was negative and additional short tandem repeat analysis confirmed the familial relationships and the de novooccurrence in the proband. Based on the de novo occurrence, clinical history, andrarity in general population databases, this alteration was classified as alikely pathogenic variant. This is the most carboxy-terminal pathogenicalteration reported to date. Additionally, this alteration contributed to theclassification of six other upstream CDH1 carboxy-terminal truncating variants aspathogenic or likely pathogenic. Identifying the most distal pathogenicalteration provides evidence to classify other carboxy-terminal truncatingvariants as either pathogenic or benign, a fundamental step to offeringpresymptomatic screening and prophylactic procedures to the appropriate patients.Â© 2018 Krempely and Karam; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.DOI: 10.1101/mcs.a003012 PMID: 29798843
