The 40-item Quality of Recovery score, pain score, and opioid use in the postoperative period were compared statistically between groups. Poweranalysis ensured 80 percent power to detect a 10-point (clinically significant)difference in the 40-item Quality of Recovery score.RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were enrolled. Age, body mass index, laterality,mastectomy type, and lymph node dissection were similar between groups. Therewere no statistical differences in quality of recovery, pain burden as measuredby visual analogue scale, opioid consumption, antiemetic use, or length ofhospital stay between groups at 24 hours after surgery. Mean global 40-itemQuality of Recovery scores were 169 (range, 155 to 182) for the treatment arm and165 (range, 143 to 179) for the placebo arm (p = 0.36), indicating a high qualityof recovery in both groups.CONCLUSION: Although intraoperative nerve blocks can be a safe adjunct to acomprehensive postsurgical recovery regimen, the authors' results indicate noeffect on overall quality of recovery from tissue expander/implant breastreconstruction.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, I.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004104 PMID: 29481391  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
