We document cancer incidence patterns in 2012 among older adultsglobally, and examine the changing magnitude of cancer in this age group over thenext decades. Using GLOBOCAN 2012 data, we presented the number and proportion ofnew cancer cases, and the truncated age-standardized incidence rates among adultsaged 65 years and older for all cancer sites combined and for the five mostcommon cancer sites by world region. We calculated the incidence in 2035 byapplying population projections, assuming no changes in rates. In 2012, 6.7million new cancer cases (47.5% of all cancers) were diagnosed among older adultsworldwide, with marked regional disparities. Nearly 48% of these cases occurredin less developed regions. Lung, colorectal, prostate, stomach and breast cancersrepresented 55% of the global incidence, yet distinct regional patterns wereobserved. We predict 14 million new cancer cases by 2035, representing almost 60%of the global cancer incidence. The largest relative increase in incidence ispredicted in the Middle East and Northern Africa (+157%), and in China (+155%).Less developed regions will see an increase of new cases by 144%, compared with54% in more developed regions. The expected increase in cancer incidence at olderages will have substantial economic and social impacts globally, posingconsiderable and unique challenge to healthcare systems in every world region,especially in those with limited resources and weaker health systems.
