United Kingdom.BACKGROUND: Risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) with tissue expander thenimplant-based breast reconstruction conventionally involved immediate submuscularplacement of tissue expanders during mastectomy, then after expansion,replacement of expanders for permanent implants in a second stage operation. Use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) can achieve a single staged operation but ADMsare costly and may have potential complications. We aim to assess the feasibilityof placement of implants as a first stage before RRM as a novel technique ofreconstruction which avoids the need for serial outpatient expansion and ADM.METHODS: Patients for RRM were offered first stage dual plane placement of fixed volume silicone gel permanent implants via inframammary fold incisions. RRM wasundertaken several months later as the second operation, leaving the implants in place protected by the muscle and capsule pocket. Nipples were preserved orreconstructed according to patient's choice.RESULTS: Eight patients with 15 operated breasts were recruited. Anatomicallyshaped implants were used in all patients and complete coverage of each implantwas achieved. Mean implant volume was 433ml (range: 290-545ml). There were nocomplications and good aesthetic outcomes were achieved.CONCLUSIONS: This proof of principle finds that placement of implants before RRM is a novel technique for women at high breast cancer risk that could reduce theuse of tissue expanders and ADMs and their associated problems. Two-staged RRMwith first stage implant placement and subsequent RRM leaving the implants inplace is feasible with no complications and can produce a good cosmetic outcome.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004635 PMID: 29878997
