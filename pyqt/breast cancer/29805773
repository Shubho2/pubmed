About 1 in 8 women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime and breast cancer remains the second leading cause ofcancer-related death. In pursuit of novel therapeutic strategies, researchershave examined the tumor microenvironment as a potential anti-cancer target. Inaddition to neoplastic cells, the tumor microenvironment is composed of severalcritical normal cell types, including fibroblasts, vascular and lymph endothelialcells, osteoclasts, adipocytes, and immune cells. These cells have importantroles in healthy tissue stasis, which frequently are altered in tumors. Indeed,tumor-associated stromal cells often contribute to tumorigenesis, tumorprogression, and metastasis. Consequently, these host cells may serve as apossible target in anti-tumor and anti-metastatic therapeutic strategies.Targeting the tumor associated host cells offers the benefit that such cells donot mutate and develop resistance in response to treatment, a major cause offailure in cancer therapeutics targeting neoplastic cells. This review discusses the role of host cells in the tumor microenvironment during tumorigenesis,progression, and metastasis, and provides an overview of recent developments intargeting these cell populations to enhance cancer therapy efficacy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25245 PMCID: PMC5955086PMID: 29805773
