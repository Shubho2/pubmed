To date, relationship of age, receipt ofradiotherapy (RT), and estimated doses received by target organs have not yetbeen well elucidated. Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database,patients aged 20 to 44, diagnosed with a first primary staging I-IIIA ipsilateralbreast invasive ductal carcinoma, underwent surgery during 1988 to 2009 wereidentified, and those with a second malignancy at ≥1-year follow-up were analyzedto calculate cumulative incidences (CIs) of second malignancy in whole group and each subgroup. Subgroups were dichotomized by surgery type, axillary dissection, and axillary lymph node status. With a median follow-up of 11.8 years, 22,628women including 1495 patients (6.6%) developing second malignancies (3.7%contralateral breast cancer, 2.9% non-breast second malignancies, and 0.7%high-dose site second malignancies) were identified. Three-dimensional coordinatesystems with age at primary diagnosis, time after primary breast cancerdiagnosis, and CI of second malignancy as 3 axes, for endpoints including allsecond malignancy, second primary contralateral breast cancer, and non-breastsecond malignancy were presented, along with the risk in RT and non-RT groups in overall group and subgroups. Five-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year all secondmalignancy-free survivals in RT and non-RT groups were 89.5% versus 85.4%, 80.1% versus 75.0%, 72.9% versus 67.9%, and 65.6% versus 61.8% (P < .0001). From thelarge national dataset, a broad visualized overview of second malignancy risk,including second contralateral breast cancer and non-breast second cancer,suggests generally beneficial therapeutic ratio for radiotherapy in young womenwith early-stage breast cancer.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010593 PMCID: PMC5944535PMID: 29703057  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
