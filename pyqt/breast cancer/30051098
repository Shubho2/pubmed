Because poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors havesignificant activity in BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian and breast cancers, RUCAPANCinvestigated the efficacy and safety of rucaparib in BRCA1/2-mutant pancreaticcancer.Patients and Methods: RUCAPANC enrolled patients with measurable locallyadvanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer who had received one to two priorchemotherapy regimens. Patients received oral rucaparib (600 mg twice daily)until disease progression. The primary end point was objective response rate.Results: Nineteen patients were enrolled. Sixteen of 19 BRCA1/2 mutations weregerm-line; three were somatic. Patients had received a median of two priorchemotherapy regimens. Four patients achieved a response; two partial responsesand one complete response (CR) were confirmed (objective response rate, 15.8%; 3 of 19), with an additional CR unconfirmed. The disease control rate (CR, partial response, or stable disease for ≥ 12 weeks) was 31.6% (6 of 19) in all patientsand 44.4% (4 of 9) in those who had received one prior chemotherapy regimen. Asprespecified in the protocol, enrollment was stopped because of an insufficientresponse rate among the first 15 patients. Treatment-emergent adverse eventsincluded nausea (63.2%) and anemia (47.4%). Grade ≥ 3 adverse events includedanemia (31.6%), fatigue (15.8%), and ascites (15.8%). Secondary resistancemutations were detected in circulating free tumor DNA in two patients with agermline BRCA2 mutation. These mutations are predicted to lead to the reversionof a somatic-not germline-mutation.Conclusion: Rucaparib provided clinical benefit to patients with advancedpancreatic cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation, and demonstrated an acceptable safetyprofile. Additional trials of rucaparib in this population are warranted.PMCID: PMC6057747PMID: 30051098
