Follow-up computed tomography on day 34of lenvatinib treatment showed pneumothorax. The pneumothorax was temporarilyimproved with chest drainage. However, pleurodesis was performed to treat arelapse of the pneumothorax. Pneumothorax during chemotherapy for a malignanttumor is considered a relatively rare complication. This case is the firstdocumentation that pneumothorax may develop during lenvatinib treatment. Thepossible development of pneumothorax should be considered when lenvatinib is usedin patients with lung metastasis.DOI: 10.1155/2018/7875929 PMCID: PMC5896288PMID: 29796324
