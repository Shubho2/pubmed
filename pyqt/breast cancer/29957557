This study comparessurvival between screened women diagnosed with breast cancer who have undergoneassessment through a BAC and usual care (UC).METHODS: A retrospective design identified two concurrent cohorts of women aged50 to 69 within the OBSP diagnosed with screen-detected invasive breast cancer ata BAC (n = 2010) and UC (n = 1844) between 2002 and 2010 and followed until 2016.Demographic and assessment characteristics were obtained from the OBSP.Abstraction of medical charts provided prognostic and treatment data. Death data were assessed from the Registered Person's Database and the Ontario RegistrarGeneral All-Cause Mortality File. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modelscompared overall survival by assessment type (BAC/UC), stratified by stage.RESULTS: There were 505 deaths during the study (BAC = 239; UC = 266). Amongwomen with stage I screen-detected breast cancer, those diagnosed through a BAChad 31% reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53-0.90)compared to UC. Diagnosis within 7 weeks of an abnormal mammogram reduced thehazard of death from all causes by 34% among all women with stage I breastcancers (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.47-0.91), and was more likely in BAC (79.7%) than UC (66.9%).CONCLUSION: The significant improvement in overall survival for women with stage I screen-detected invasive breast cancer assessed through BACs further supportsthe recommendation that women with abnormal mammograms should be managed through organized assessment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
