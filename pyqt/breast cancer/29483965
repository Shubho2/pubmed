Kyoto, 606-8507 Japan.Background: The aim of this study is to assess the survival benefits ofadditional induction chemotherapy before concurrent chemotherapy,intensity-modulated radiotherapy and nimotuzumab in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Methods: Clinical data from 1104 nonmetastaticnasopharyngeal carcinoma patients diagnosed between May 2008 and April 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients received addition of inductionchemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without nimotuzumab. Apropensity score matched method was used to identify paired patients according tovarious covariates. Results: In total, 120 pairs were selected by propensityscore matched method. At a median follow-up time of 56 months (10-99 months), the5-year locoregional relapse-free survival, distant metastases-free survival,progression-free survival and overall survival rates in patients treated withnimotuzumab vs. without nimotuzumab were 91.6% vs. 91.1% (P= 0.957), 95.8% vs.83.9% (P= 0.007), 87.4% vs. 81.3% (P= 0.225), 94.5% vs. 85.6% (P= 0.058),respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that nimotuzumab was an independent prognosticator of OS and DMFS. Conclusions: Nimotuzumab is an effective treatmentoption for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and the addition of induction chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiotherapy and nimotuzumab couldobtain the best survival benefits.DOI: 10.7150/jca.20461 PMCID: PMC5820927PMID: 29483965
