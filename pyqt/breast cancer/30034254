Statistical analysis wasperformed using the chi-squared test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Coxregression analysis. A 1:1 propensity score matching method was performed todecrease the selection bias.Results: We identified 1,732 patient-pairs that were completely matched. In theunmatched population, 8,198 and 1,802 patients received mastectomy only andimmediate breast reconstruction, respectively. Patients who received immediatebreast reconstruction had better breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) (hazardratio [HR] 0.880, 95% CI 0.783-0.989, P = 0.032) and overall survival (OS) (HR0.846, 95% CI 0.758-0.943, P = 0.003) than patients who underwent mastectomyalone. However, in the matched population, there was comparable BCSS and OSbetween patients who received immediate breast reconstruction and mastectomyalone. Subset analysis in the matched population found that immediate breastreconstruction was associated with better BCSS (HR 0.750, 95% CI 0.614-0.917, P =0.005) and OS (HR 0.779, 95% CI 0.644-0.942, P = 0.010) compared to patients aged<50 years who received mastectomy alone.Conclusion: There are comparable survival outcomes in LABC patients who received immediate breast reconstruction or mastectomy alone followed by PMRT. However,patients aged <50 years had a survival advantage after immediate breastreconstruction.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S162430 PMCID: PMC6049048PMID: 30034254
