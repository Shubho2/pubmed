Targeting these everolimus-resistant patients with the latest standard of care, CDK4/6inhibitors, has not been clearly addressed. Understanding the signalingtransduction pathways, which everolimus resistance activates, will elucidate the mechanisms and offer treatment strategies of everolimus resistance.METHODS: To mimic the clinical setting, letrozole-resistant cells were used togenerate an everolimus-resistant model (RAD-R). Reverse phase protein array(RPPA) was performed to reveal changes in the signaling transduction pathways,and expression levels of key proteins were analyzed. Inhibitors targeting themajor signaling pathways, a CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib and a mTORC1/2 inhibitor(MLN0128), were evaluated to establish resistance mechanisms of RAD-R.RESULTS: RPPA results from RAD-R indicated changes to significant regulatorypathways and upregulation of p-AKT expression level associating with everolimusresistance. MLN0128, that inhibits the AKT phosphorylation, effectivelysuppressed the proliferation of RAD-R cells while treatment with palbociclib had no effect.CONCLUSION: Among the many signaling transduction pathways, which are alteredpost everolimus resistance, targeting dual mTORC1/2 is a possible option forpatients who have recurrent disease from previous everolimus treatment.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4779-x PMCID: PMC6026053 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29623577
