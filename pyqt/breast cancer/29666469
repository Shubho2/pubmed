How the relief from p53 tumor suppressive functions results in tumor cell aggressive behavior is onlypartially elucidated. In an attempt to shed light on the implication of microRNAsin this context, we discovered a new signaling axis involving p53, miR-30a andZEB2. By an in silico approach we identified miR-30a as a putative p53 target andobserved that in breast tumors reduced miR-30a expression correlated with p53inactivation, lymph node positivity and poor prognosis. We demonstrate that p53binds the MIR30A promoter and induces the transcription of both miRNA strands 5p and 3p. Both miR-30a-5p and -3p showed the capacity of targeting ZEB2, atranscription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumorcell migration and drug resistance. Intriguingly, we found that p53 does restrainZEB2 expression via miR-30a. Finally, we provide evidence that the newp53/miR-30a/ZEB2 axis controls tumor cell invasion and distal spreading andimpinges upon miR-200c expression. Overall, this study highlights the existenceof a novel axis linking p53 to EMT via miR-30a, and adds support to the notionthat miRNAs represent key elements of the complex network whereby p53inactivation affects TNBC clinical behavior.DOI: 10.1038/s41418-018-0103-x PMID: 29666469
