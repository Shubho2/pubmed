ER-α plays a vital role in the initiation and progression of breastcancer and confers chemo and radioresistance to the cancer cells by upregulating expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. The synthetic pyrazole derivative3-(1-(4-bromophenyl)-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine (compound 5d) displayssignificant cytotoxicity against mammary carcinoma cells. Molecular dockingstudies revealed that compound 5d binds to ligand binding domain of (ER-α). Invivo studies were carried out to investigate ER-α expression byimmunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR, which revealed reduction of ER-α intumor cells upon treatment with compound 5d indicating its ER-α antagonisticeffect. Our study ascertains compound 5d as a potent inhibitor of mammarycarcinoma cells.DOI: 10.1007/s11010-018-3350-8 PMID: 29777335
