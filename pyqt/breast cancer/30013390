We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the relationshipbetween CYP17 polymorphisms (rs743572 and rs2486758) and breast cancer (BC) risk.Patients and methods: This case-control study included 560 BC patients and 583age-matched healthy controls from Northwest China. Two polymorphisms (rs743572and rs2486758) of CYP17 were genotyped by using Sequenom MassARRAY. ORs and 95%CIs were used to evaluate the relationship.Results: Compared with the wild genotype of rs743572, we found a significantlyreduced risk of BC associated with the variant genotypes (heterozygote model:OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.53-0.89; homozygote model: OR=0.68, 95% CI=0.49-0.95; dominant model: OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.54-0.87; overdominant model: OR=0.78, 95% CI=0.62-0.98; allele model: OR=0.79, 95% CI=0.66-0.93). For rs2486758 polymorphism, we did not find any difference in any of the genetic models. Further stratification analysisby clinical characteristics showed rs743572 was associated with estrogen receptorstatus (heterozygote model: OR=2.13, 95% CI=1.47-3.08; homozygote model: OR=3.29,95% CI=1.94-5.58; dominant model: OR=2.39, 95% CI=1.69-3.37) and progesteronereceptor status (homozygote model: OR=3.17, 95% CI=1.82-5.55), but there was noassociation between rs2486758 and clinical characteristics of BC. Haplotypeanalysis showed that Grs743572Crs2486758 haplotype was a protective factor of BC (OR=0.52, 95% CI=0.40-0.67). Survival analysis did not find that CYP17 rs743572polymorphism was associated with triple-negative BC, either in terms of overallsurvival or progression-free survival.Conclusion: Our results suggest that CYP17 polymorphisms may reduce thesusceptibility to BC in Chinese women.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S167503 PMCID: PMC6037160PMID: 30013390
