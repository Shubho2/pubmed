China.Fisetin, a natural flavonoid found in a variety of edible and medical plants, hasbeen suggested to inhibit the proliferation of various tumor cells and to induce apoptosis. However, the effects of fisetin on breast cancer have rarely beenreported and the underlying mechanism is still undefined. The present studyexplored the anti‑cancer effects of fisetin on mammary carcinoma cells and theunderlying mechanisms. Following treatment with fisetin, viability of 4T1, MCF‑7 and MDA‑MB‑231 cells were measured by MTT assay. The inhibitory effects offisetin on proliferation, migration and invasion were evaluated in 4T1 cellsusing proliferation array, wound‑healing assay, and HUV‑EC‑C‑cell barrier basedon electrical cell‑substrate impedance sensing platform. Cell apoptosis wasanalyzed by flow cytometry, and western blotting analysis was performed toidentify target molecules. A 4T1 orthotopic mammary tumor model was used toassess the fisetin‑inhibition on tumor growth in vivo. Test kits were used toexamine the liver and kidney function of tumor‑bearing mice. The results suggest that fisetin suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, suppressed the metastasis and invasiveness of 4T1 cells, and induced the apoptosis of 4T1 cells in vitro. The potent anti‑cancer effect of fisetin was associated with theregulation of the phosphatidylinositol‑3‑kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian targetof rapamycin pathway. In vivo experiments demonstrated that fisetin suppressedthe growth of 4T1 cell‑derived orthotopic breast tumors and enhanced tumor cellapoptosis, and the evaluated alanine amino transferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels in serum of tumor‑bearing mice suggested that fisetin may leadto side effects on liver biochemical function. The present study confirms thatfisetin exerted an anti‑mammary carcinoma effect. However, in vivo experimentsalso revealed that fisetin had low solubility and low bioavailability. Furtherinvestigation is required to determine the clinical value of fisetin.DOI: 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3654 PMCID: PMC6034928PMID: 29749427
