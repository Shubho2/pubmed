Survey respondents were randomized to one of two surveys, presenting risk either as percentages only or as icon arrays andpercentages. Respondents were required to choose between two hypothetical NBSPsor no screening in 11 choice sets generated using a Bayesian D-efficient design. The trade-offs women made were analyzed using heteroskedastic conditional logitand scale-adjusted latent class models.RESULTS: A total of 1018 women completed the discrete choice experiment(percentages-only version = 507; icon arrays and percentages version = 511). The results of the heteroskedastic conditional logit model suggested that, onaverage, women were willing-to-accept 1.72 (confidence interval 1.47-1.97)additional unnecessary follow-ups and willing-to-pay £79.17 (confidence interval £66.98-£91.35) for an additional cancer detected per 100 women screened. Latentclass analysis indicated substantial heterogeneity in preferences with six latentclasses and three scale classes providing the best fit. The risk communicationformat received was not a predictor of scale class or preference classmembership.CONCLUSIONS: Most women were willing to trade-off the benefits and risks ofscreening, but decision makers seeking to improve uptake should consider thedisparate needs of women when configuring services.Copyright © 2018 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and OutcomesResearch (ISPOR).
