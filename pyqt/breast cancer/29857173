Epub2018 May 24.The trans-[Ru(PPh3)2(N,N-dimethyl-N'-thiophenylthioureato-k2O,S)(bipy)]PF6complex has pro-apoptotic effects on triple negative breast cancer cells andpresents low toxicity in vivo.Becceneri AB(1), Popolin CP(1), Plutin AM(2), Maistro EL(3), Castellano EE(4),Batista AA(5), Cominetti MR(6).Author information: (1)Departmento de Gerontologia, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, Rod.Washington Luís, Km 235, São Carlos, SP 13565-905, Brazil.(2)Facultad de Química, Universidad de la Habana, Zapata s/n entre G y CarlitosAguirre, 10400 Habana, Cuba.(3)Departamento de Fonoaudiologia, Faculdade de Filosofia e Ciências,Universidade Estadual Paulista "Júlio de Mesquita Filho", Av.

Electronic address:mcominetti@ufscar.br.Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous subtype of breast tumors that does not exhibit the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors,neither the amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)gene. Despite all the advances in cancer treatments, the development of newanticancer drugs for TNBC tumors is still a challenge. There is an increasinginterest in new agents to be used in cancer treatment. Ruthenium is a metal that has unique characteristics and important in vivo and in vitro results achievedfor cancer treatment. Thus, in this work, with the aim to develop anticancerdrugs, three new ruthenium complexes containing acylthiourea ligands have beensynthesized and characterized:trans-[Ru(PPh3)2(N,N-dibutyl-N'-benzoylthioureato-k2O,S)(2,2'-bipyridine(bipy))]PF6(1),trans-[Ru(PPh3)2(N,N-dimethyl-N'-thiophenylthioureato-k2O,S)(bipy)]PF6(2) andtrans-[Ru(PPh3)2(N,N-dimethyl-N'-benzoylthioureato-k2O,S)(bipy)]PF6(3). Then, thecytotoxicity of these three new ruthenium complexes was investigated in TNBCMDA-MB-231 and in non-tumor MCF-10A cells. Complex (2) was the most selectivecomplex and was chosen for further studies to verify its effects on cellmorphology, adhesion, migration, invasion, induction of apoptosis and DNA damage in vitro, as well as its toxicity and capacity of causing DNA damage in vivo.Complex (2) inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, changedmorphology and induced apoptosis, DNA damage and nuclear fragmentation of TNBCcells at lower concentrations compared to non-tumor MCF-10A cells, suggesting an effective action for this complex on tumor cells. Finally, complex (2) did notinduce toxicity or caused DNA damage in vivo when low doses were administered to mice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
