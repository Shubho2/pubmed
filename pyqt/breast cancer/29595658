However, the relationshipbetween SR-B1 and lung adenocarcinoma is unknown. We analyzed the expression ofSR-B1 in a well-characterized lung adenocarcinoma tissue microarray byimmunohistochemistry, in 90 cancerous and 90 adjacent normal lung tissues.Results showed that the positive expression rate of SR-B1 in cancer tissues(86/90, 96%) was significantly higher than that of adjacent tissues (50/90, 56%) (P < .001). And SR-B1 overexpression in lung adenocarcinoma tissue wassignificantly higher than that of adjacent normal tissue (P < .001), accountingfor 67% of cases. This elevated SR-B1 expression was associated with AJCC stage(P < .001), T stage (P = .012), N stage (P = .002), and lymph node positivity(P < .001). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with high SR-B1 expression had a shorter overall survival (P < .001). On the multivariateanalysis, SR-B1 was an independent prognostic factor for outcomes afteradjustment for other prognostic factors (P = .038). In conclusion, high SR-B1expression is associated with conventional pathologic parameters that representtumor aggressiveness and may purport a poor clinical prognosis in lungadenocarcinoma.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000010203 PMCID: PMC5895397PMID: 29595658  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
