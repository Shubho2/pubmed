Disseminated tumor cells encounter major changes innutrient supplies and oxidative stresses compared to the primary tumor and mustdemonstrate significant metabolic plasticity to adapt to specific metastaticsites. Recent studies suggest that differential utilization of pyruvate sits as acritical node in determining the organotropism of metastatic breast cancer.Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is key enzyme that converts pyruvate into oxaloacetate for utilization in gluconeogenesis and replenishment of the TCA cycle.METHODS: Patient survival was analyzed with respect to gene copy numberalterations and differential mRNA expression levels of PC. Expression of PC wasanalyzed in the MCF-10A, D2-HAN and the 4 T1 breast cancer progression seriesunder in vitro and in vivo growth conditions. PC expression was depleted viashRNAs and the impact on in vitro cell growth, mammary fat pad tumor growth, and pulmonary and non-pulmonary metastasis was assessed by bioluminescent imaging.Changes in glycolytic capacity, oxygen consumption, and response to oxidativestress were quantified upon PC depletion.RESULTS: Genomic copy number increases in PC were observed in 16-30% ofmetastatic breast cancer patients. High expression of PC mRNA was associated withdecreased patient survival in the MCTI and METABRIC patient datasets. Enhancedexpression of PC was not recapitulated in breast cancer progression models whenanalyzed under glucose-rich in vitro culture conditions. In contrast, PCexpression was dramatically enhanced upon glucose deprivation and in vivo inpulmonary metastases. Depletion of PC led to a dramatic decrease in 4 T1pulmonary metastasis, but did not affect orthotopic primary tumor growth. Tailvein inoculations confirmed the role of PC in facilitating pulmonary, but notextrapulmonary tumor initiation. PC-depleted cells demonstrated a decrease inglycolytic capacity and oxygen consumption rates and an enhanced sensitivity tooxidative stress.CONCLUSIONS: Our studies indicate that PC is specifically required for the growthof breast cancer that has disseminated to the lungs. Overall, these findingspoint to the potential of targeting PC for the treatment of pulmonary metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1008-9 PMCID: PMC6045837PMID: 30005601
