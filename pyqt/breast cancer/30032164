The current study demonstrated thatmiR-140-5p was frequently downregulated in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), and miR-140-5p mimics could inhibit the proliferation of BCSCs. Moreover, Wnt1 was a direct target of miR-140-5p, as was proved by luciferase reporter assays.miR-140-5p mimics could downregulate the wnt1 mRNA and protein levels in MCF-7and MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, miR-140 mimics could enhance the sensitivityof BCSCs to doxorubicin (Dox) through the Wnt1/ABCB1 pathway both in vitro andvivo. Our findings have presented a novel miRNA-mediated regulatory network forBCSCs, which may provide a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41417-018-0035-0 PMID: 30032164
