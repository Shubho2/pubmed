We applied novelgeospatial methods and identified hot spot counties based on breast cancermortality rates. We assessed differences in county-level characteristics between hot spot and other counties using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Spearmancorrelation, and stratified all analysis by race/ethnicity.RESULTS: Among all women, 80 of 3,108 (2.57%) contiguous US counties were deemed hot spots for breast cancer mortality with the majority located in the southernregion of the US (72.50%, p value < 0.001). In race/ethnicity-specific analyses, 119 (3.83%) hot spot counties were identified for NH-Black women, with themajority being located in southern states (98.32%, p value < 0.001). AmongHispanic women, there were 83 (2.67%) hot spot counties and the majority waslocated in the southwest region of the US (southern = 61.45%, western = 33.73%, pvalue < 0.001). We did not observe definitive geographic patterns in breastcancer mortality for NH-White women. Hot spot counties were more likely to haveresidents with lower education, lower household income, higher unemploymentrates, higher uninsured population, and higher proportion indicating cost as abarrier to medical care.CONCLUSIONS: We observed geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in breastcancer mortality: NH-Black and Hispanic breast cancer deaths were moreconcentrated in southern, lower SES counties.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1051-y PMID: 29922896
