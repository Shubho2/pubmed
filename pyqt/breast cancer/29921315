Specifically, breast cancer macrophages tightlycontrol the angiogenic switch and progression to malignancy. ID4, a member of theID (inhibitors of differentiation) family of proteins, is associated with astem-like phenotype and poor prognosis in basal-like breast cancer. Moreover, ID4favours angiogenesis by enhancing the expression of pro-angiogenic cytokinesinterleukin-8, CXCL1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. In the presentstudy, we investigated whether ID4 protein exerts its pro-angiogenic functionwhile also modulating the activity of tumour-associated macrophages in breastcancer.METHODS: We performed IHC analysis of ID4 protein and macrophage marker CD68 in atriple-negative breast cancer series. Next, we used cell migration assays toevaluate the effect of ID4 expression modulation in breast cancer cells on themotility of co-cultured macrophages. The analysis of breast cancer geneexpression data repositories allowed us to evaluate the ability of ID4 to predictsurvival in subsets of tumours showing high or low macrophage infiltration. Byculturing macrophages in conditioned media obtained from breast cancer cells inwhich ID4 expression was modulated by overexpression or depletion, we identified changes in the expression of ID4-dependent angiogenesis-related transcripts andmicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) in macrophages by RT-qPCR.RESULTS: We determined that ID4 and macrophage marker CD68 protein expressionwere significantly associated in a series of triple-negative breast tumours.Interestingly, ID4 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels robustly predicted survival,specifically in the subset of tumours showing high macrophage infiltration. Invitro and in vivo migration assays demonstrated that expression of ID4 in breast cancer cells stimulates macrophage motility. At the molecular level, ID4 protein expression in breast cancer cells controls, through paracrine signalling, theactivation of an angiogenic programme in macrophages. This programme includesboth the increase of angiogenesis-related mRNAs and the decrease of members ofthe anti-angiogenic miR-15b/107 group. Intriguingly, these miRNAs control theexpression of the cytokine granulin, whose enhanced expression in macrophagesconfers increased angiogenic potential.CONCLUSIONS: These results uncover a key role for ID4 in dictating the behaviour of tumour-associated macrophages in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0990-2 PMCID: PMC6009061PMID: 29921315
