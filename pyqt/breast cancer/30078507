Though there were two large prevalence studies in Chinese OC patients, thiswas the first time to observe it in healthy controls.METHODS: We performed BRCA mutation screening using next-generation sequencing todetermine the prevalence of BRCA germline deleterious mutations in an unselected cohort of Chinese OC patients (n = 1331) versus healthy controls (n = 1763) anddescribe the types and spectrum of BRCA deleterious variants.RESULTS: Among the 1331 patients with OC, 227 (17.1%) carried deleteriousvariants in BRCA1 and 70 (5.3%) carried deleterious variants in BRCA2. Of 1763control subjects, 6 (0.3%) and 2 (0.1%) had deleterious variants in BRCA1 andBRCA2. No patient carried mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 simultaneously.Sixty-three novel mutations were identified, and three Chinese specific hot-spot mutations were notified as BRCA1 c.5470_5477delATTGGGCA, BRCA1 c.981_982delAT,and BRCA1 c.3770_3771delAG. Interestingly, all these high-frequency recurrentmutations were distributed on exon 10, which may also be the Chinese OC BRCAmutations' distinct characteristics. In addition, in our study, the estimatedodds ratio (OR) of OC associated with BRCA1 positive variants were approximately 34.6 (95% CI, 12.5-95.7) in age group under 40 and 42.4 (95% CI, 5.9-305.2) ingroup older than 50 in the Chinese population, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: We recommend BRCA testing to all Chinese OC patients and thosegeneral Chinese who have family members with hereditary breast and ovarianrelated cancer (HBOC)-related cancers. Variants carriers would not only benefitfrom early prevention of OC but also for the medical management.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.ygyno.2018.07.024 PMID: 30078507
