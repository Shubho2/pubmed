[Epubahead of print]Myoepithelial cells are a dynamic barrier to epithelial dissemination.Sirka OK(1), Shamir ER(1), Ewald AJ(2).Author information: (1)Departments of Cell Biology, Oncology, and Biomedical Engineering, Center for Cell Dynamics, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.(2)Departments of Cell Biology, Oncology, and Biomedical Engineering, Center for Cell Dynamics, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MDandrew.ewald@jhmi.edu.The mammary epithelium is composed of an inner luminal and surroundingmyoepithelial cell layer. The presence of cancer cells beyond the myoepitheliumdefines invasive breast cancer, yet the role of the myoepithelium during invasionremains unclear. We developed a 3D organotypic culture assay to model thisprocess through lineage-specific expression of the prometastatic transcriptionfactor Twist1 We sought to distinguish the functional role of the myoepitheliumin regulating invasion and local dissemination. Myoepithelial-specific Twist1expression induced cell-autonomous myoepithelial cell escape. Remarkably,luminal-specific Twist1 expression was rarely sufficient for escape. Time-lapsemicroscopy revealed that myoepithelial cells collectively restrain andreinternalize invading Twist1+ luminal cells. Barrier function correlated withmyoepithelial abundance and required the expression of α-smooth muscle actin and P-cadherin. We next demonstrated that myoepithelial cells can restrain andrecapture invasive cancer cells. Our data establish the concept of themyoepithelium as a dynamic barrier to luminal dissemination and implicate bothsmooth muscle contractility and intercellular adhesion in barrier function.© 2018 Sirka et al.DOI: 10.1083/jcb.201802144 PMID: 30061105
