Our previous study showed that bound polyphenolof inner shell (BPIS) from foxtail millet bran displayed effective antitumoractivities in vitro and in vivo. The present research further implied that BPIShas the ability to reverse the multidrug resistance of colorectal cancer in humanHCT-8/Fu cells, the IC50 values of 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu), oxaliplatin (L-OHP),and vincristine (VCR) were decreased form 6593 ± 53.8, 799 ± 48.9, and 247 ± 10.3μM to 5350 ± 22.3 (3261 ± 56.9), 416 ± 16.6 (252 ± 15.6), and 144 ± 8.30 (83.8 ± 5.60) μM when HCT-8/Fu cells were pretreated with 0.5 (1.0) mg/mL BPIS for 12 h. The 12 phenolic acid compounds of BPIS were identified by ultraperformance liquidchromatography-triple-time of flight/mass spectrometry (UPLC-Triple-TOF/MS)method. Especially, the fraction of molecular weight (MW) < 200 of BPIS reversed the multidrug resistance in HCT-8/Fu cells, and ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid were the main active components, the IC50 values were 1.23 ± 0.195 and 2.68 ±0.163 mg/mL, respectively. The present data implied that BPIS significantlyenhanced the sensitivity of chemotherapeutic drugs through inhibiting cellproliferation, promoting cell apoptosis, and increasing the accumulation ofrhodamine-123 (Rh-123) in HCT-8/Fu cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) and Western blot data indicated that BPIS also decreased the expression levels of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), andbreast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Collectively, these results show thatBPIS has potential ability to be used as a new drug-resistance reversal agent in colorectal cancer.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jafc.8b01659 PMID: 29730933  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
