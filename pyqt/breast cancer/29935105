The title compounds were synthesized in the reaction sequence involving reaction of diethylmethylphosphonate with methyl 2-(tosylamino)benzoate, condensation of thus formeddiethyl 2-oxo-2-(2-N-tosylphenyl)ethylphosphonate with various aldehydes followedby successful application of the obtained3-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-1,2-dihydroquinolin-4-ols as Horner-Wadsworth-Emmonsreagents for the olefination of formaldehyde. Also, enantioselective approach to the target compounds has been evaluated using 3-dimenthoxyphosphoryl group as achiral auxiliary. Single X-ray crystal analysis of(2S)-3-(dimenthoxyphosphoryl)-2-phenyl-1-tosyldihydroquinolin-4-ol revealed thepresence of strong resonance-assisted hydrogen bond (RAHB). The obtained3-methylidene-2,3-dihydroquinolin-4(1H)-ones were then tested for their cytotoxicactivity against two leukemia cell lines NALM-6 and HL-60 and a breast cancerMCF-7 cell line. All compounds showed very high cytotoxic activity with the IC50 values mostly below 1 μm in all three cancer cell lines. The selected analogswere also tested on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and on humanmammary gland/breast cells (MCF-10A) to evaluate their influence on normal cells.Since one of the most serious problems in cancer chemotherapy is the development of drug resistance, the mRNA levels and activity of ABCB1 transporter considered to be the most important factor engaged in drug resistance, were evaluated inMCF-7 cells treated with two selected analogs. Both compounds were strong ABCB1transporter inhibitors that could prevent efflux of anticancer drugs from cancer cells.© 2018 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.DOI: 10.1002/cbdv.201800242 PMID: 29935105
