Electronic address: fproenca@quimica.uminho.pt.Chalcone and chromene derivatives were synthesized in good yield through simpleand effective reactions using innocuous solvents such as water and ethanol andhigh yielding aldol condensations. Generally, the reactions were performed atroom temperature, leading to the isolation of highly pure compounds. Thesecompounds were tested on breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and Hs578T) and breastnon-neoplastic cells (MCF-10A). After determination of IC50 value, specificassays were performed to analyze the potential of these compounds, and thosebearing halogenated substituents presented enhanced activity comparing tomethoxyl or methyl groups. More specifically, the bromine atom was often present in the bioactive molecules that proceeded to the final assays and showed to bepromising candidates for further studies. The selected chromene acted as a cellmigration inhibitory agent and triggered regulated cell death associated withG2/M cell-arrest and microtubule destabilization. For chalcones, the resultssuggest an anti-proliferative activity. Also, results for combination-therapypotentiated the antitumor effect of doxorubicin and reduced cytotoxicity inMCF-10A cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
