[Epub ahead of print]Annexin A7 is correlated with better clinical outcomes of patients with breastcancer.Huang Y(1), Wang H(2), Yang Y(2).Author information: (1)Galactophore Department, The Second Clinical Medical College, YangtzeUniversity, Jingzhou Central Hospital, Jingzhou, China.(2)Pharmacy Department, Jingzhou Central Hospital, Jingzhou, China.The clinical prognosis of breast cancer (BC) patients remains poor. Studies on BCmicroarrays GSE37751, GSE7390, and GSE21653 were reanalyzed to characterize theexpressions of annexin A7 (ANXA7) in BC patients and the corresponding normalbreast tissues and the correlation between ANXA7 expression and clinicalcharacteristics and survivals of BC patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)was applied to investigate the exact mechanisms as for the expression of ANXA7and the proliferation of BC cells. The level of ANXA7 expression wassignificantly decreased in BC patients than that in normal controls (P < .0001). BC patients in the ANXA7 high-expression group were associated with betterclinical features such as tumor size; histopathological grading; estrogenreceptors; and clinical risk groups according to St Gallen criteria, Nottinghamprognostic index criteria, and Veridex signature compared with those in the ANXA7low-expression group. Higher expression of ANXA7 predicted better prognosis of BCpatients. The result of GSEA indicated that ANXA7 might inhibit the proliferationof BC cells through biological processes involved in androgen response, hememetabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. The messenger RNA and protein levelsof ANXA7 were decreased in BC tissues compared with those in normal breasttissues. Our results proved that ANXA7 was downregulated in BC cells and that ahigher expression of ANXA7 was associated with better prognosis of BC patients.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcb.27087 PMID: 29893423
