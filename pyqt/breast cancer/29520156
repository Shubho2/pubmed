Recently, researchers discovered that overexpression ofFOXK2 inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, and is related to the clinical prognosis.However, in hepatocellular carcinoma, FOXK2 results in the opposite phenotypes.Currently, the contribution of FOXK2 to glioma pathogenesis is not clear.Patients and methods: We evaluated the expression of FOXK2 in 151 glioma patientsusing immunohistochemistry assays. The associations among the expression ofFOXK2, clinicopathological parameters, and the prognosis of glioma patients were statistically analyzed. We downregulated and upregulated the level of FOXK2 inglioma cells by transfections with small interfering RNA and plasmids. Then, weinvestigated the effects on tumor cell behavior in vitro by Cell Counting Kit-8assays, colony-formation assay, transwell assay, and theepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarker levels.Results: The clinical data showed that expression of FOXK2 gradually decreasedwith increasing World Health Organization (WHO) grades and a low level of FOXK2indicates a poor prognosis. FOXK2 expression is negatively correlated with Ki67expression and the WHO degree but is not correlated with otherclinicopathological parameters, including sex, age, Karnofsky Performance Status,tumor diameter, O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, and glutathioneS-transferase pi. FOXK2 knockdown enhances glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT process, and, in contrast, FOXK2 overexpression inhibits gliomacell proliferation, migration, invasion, and the EMT process.Conclusion: Expression of FOXK2 gradually decreases with increasing WHO grades.FOXK2 inhibits tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. FOXK2 is a critical mediator of the EMT process.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S157126 PMCID: PMC5833792PMID: 29520156
