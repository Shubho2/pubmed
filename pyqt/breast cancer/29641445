Natural bioactive compounds such ascurcumin have been substantially studied as an alternative to anticancer drugtherapies and have been surmised as a potent agent but, nevertheless, remaindeficient due to its poor cellular uptake. Therefore, efforts now have shiftedtoward mimicking curcumin to synthesize novel compounds sharing similar effects. A synthetic analog, (Z)-3-hydroxy-1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-phenylprop-2-ene-1-one(DK1), was recently synthesized and reported to confer improved bioavailabilityand selectivity toward human breast cancer cells. This study, therefore, aims to assess the anticancer mechanism of DK1 in relation to the induction of in vitrocell death in selected human colon cancer cell lines. Usingthe3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide(MTT) assay, thecytotoxicity of DK1 towards HT29 and SW620 cell lines were investigated. Acridineorange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) dual-staining assay and flow cytometry analyses(cell cycle analysis, Annexin/V-FITC and JC-1 assays) were incorporated todetermine the mode of cell death. To further determine the mechanism of celldeath, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and proteomeprofiling were conducted. Results from this study suggest that DK1 inducedchanges in cell morphology, leading to a decrease in cell viability andsubsequent induction of apoptosis. DK1 treatment inhibited cell viability andproliferation 48 h post treatment with IC50 values of 7.5 ± 1.6 µM for HT29 cellsand 14.5 ± 4.3 µM for SW620 cells, causing cell cycle arrest with increasedaccumulation of cell populations at the sub-G₀/G₁phaseof 74% and 23%,respectively. Flow cytometry analyses showed that DK1 treatment in cancer cellsinduced apoptosis, as indicated by DNA fragmentation and depolarization of themitochondrial membrane. qRT-PCR results show significant upregulation in theexpression of caspase-9 in both HT29 and SW620 cell lines, further supportingthat cell death induction by DK1 is via an intrinsic pathway. These outcomes,therefore, demonstrate DK1 as a potential anticancer agent for colonadenocarcinoma due to its anti-apoptotic attributes.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19041151 PMCID: PMC5979415PMID: 29641445
