We will summarize current physical activityguidelines for cancer survivors and discuss opportunities to study and implement physical activity programs in cancer survivors.RECENT FINDINGS: Observational evidence suggests that physical activity isassociated with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer, a reduced risk ofbreast cancer recurrence, and improved breast cancer-specific and all-causemortality. Studies also show that physical activity improves factors important toquality of life such as chemotherapy-related fatigue and the aromataseinhibitor-induced musculoskeletal syndrome. Physical activity is an importantcomponent of breast cancer survivorship. Challenges exist in conducting clinical trials of physical activity and implementing current guidelines, yet there aresignificant opportunities to advance the field through translational researchefforts and utilization of available community resources.DOI: 10.1007/s11912-018-0702-1 PMID: 29713835
