China.Apoptosis-stimulating p53 protein 2 (ASPP2) is an apoptosis inducer that acts viabinding with p53 and then enhancing the transcriptional activities towardpro‑apoptosis genes. ASPP2 has recently been reported to serve a major role inp53‑independent pathways. Triple‑negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a type ofbreast cancer that is more aggressive and highly lethal when p53 is mutated. Inthe present study, the mRNA level of ASPP2 was found to be suppressed in breasttumors compared with that in adjacent normal breast tissues, and the expressionof ASPP2 was also decreased in a series of breast cancer cell lines compared withthat in MCF‑10A normal breast cells. Downregulation of ASPP2 by specific smallinterfering RNA (siRNA) transfection was able to promote cell growth, reduce cellapoptosis, and contribute to cell migration and invasion. Furthermore,downregulation of ASPP2 promoted cell epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MDA‑MB‑231 and HCC‑1937 TNBC cells. Furthermore, it was found that when ASPP2siRNA was transfected into MDA‑MB‑231 and HCC‑1937 cells, the expression ofphosphoinositide‑3‑kinase regulatory subunit 1 (p85α) decreased andphosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) increased, which are key molecularregulators in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. Inconclusion, the present data indicated that ASPP2 had a crucial influence on the proliferation and metastasis in TNBC, and that the functional mechanism may bep53‑independent to a great extent. ASPP2 and its link with the PI3K/AKT pathwaydeserve further investigation and may provide novel insights into therapeutictargets for TNBC.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4331 PMID: 29568874
