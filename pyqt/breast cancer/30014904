The breast cancersusceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1), a tumor suppressor, can modulate cellularantioxidant response and DNA repair. Yet the role of BRCA1 in cerebral I/R injuryhas not been explored. In this study, we observed that BRCA1 was mainly expressedin neurons and was up-regulated in response to I/R insult. Overexpression ofBRCA1 attenuated reactive oxygen species production and lipid peroxidation.Enhanced BRCA1 expression promoted DNA double strand break repair throughnon-homologous end joining pathway. These effects consequently led to neuronalcell survival and neurological recovery. Mechanically, BRCA1 can interact withthe nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) through BRCA1 C-terminal(BRCT) domain. The cross-talk between BRCT and NRF2 activated theNRF2/Antioxidant Response Element signaling pathway and thus protected injuredneurons during cerebral I/R. In conclusion, enhanced BRCA1 after cerebral I/Rinjury may attenuate or prevent neural damage from I/R via NRF2-mediatedantioxidant pathway. The finding may provide a potential therapeutic targetagainst ischemic stroke.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
