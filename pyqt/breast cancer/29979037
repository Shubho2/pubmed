The results are likely related to the deformabilitydifferences between nonmalignant and malignant breast cells. The data wereanalyzed by the methods/algorithms of Ridge, nonnegative garrote on kernelmachine (NGK), and Lasso using high-dimensional variables, including the cellsizes, velocities, and velocity increments. In kernel learning based methods, theprediction values of 10-fold cross-validations are used to represent thedifference between two groups of data, where a value of 100% indicates the twogroups are completely distinct and identifiable. The prediction value is used to represent the difference between two groups using the established algorithmclassifier from high-dimensional variables. These methods were applied toheterogeneous cell populations prepared using primary tumor and adjacent normaltissue obtained from two patients. Primary breast cancer cells were distinguishedfrom patient-matched adjacent normal cells with a prediction ratio of70.07%-75.96% by the NGK method. Thus, this high-throughput multiconstrictionmicrofluidic device together with the kernel learning method can be used toperturb and analyze the biomechanical status of cells obtained from small primarytumor biopsy samples. The resultant biomechanical velocity signatures identifymalignancy and provide a new marker for evaluation in risk assessment.DOI: 10.1021/acssensors.8b00301 PMID: 29979037
