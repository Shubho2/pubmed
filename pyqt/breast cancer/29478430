[Epub ahead ofprint]Weight, physical activity and breast cancer survival.McTiernan A(1).Author information: (1)Division of Public Health Sciences, Program in Epidemiology,Fred HutchinsonCancer Research Center,PO Box 19024, M4-B874, Seattle, Washington 98109,USA.Weight, weight change and physical activity may affect prognosis among women who are diagnosed with breast cancer. Observational studies show associations betweenoverweight/obesity and weight gain with several measures of reduced prognosis in women with breast cancer, and some suggestions of lower survival in women who areunderweight or who experience unexplained weight loss after diagnosis.Observational studies have also shown an association between higher levels ofphysical activity and reduced breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality,although a dose-response relationship has not been established. The effects ofpurposive dietary weight loss and increase in physical activity on survival orrecurrence in breast cancer are not yet established, and randomised controlledtrials are needed for definitive data. This paper presents the epidemiologicevidence on weight status, weight change, and physical activity and breast cancersurvival; suggests potential mediating mechanisms; summarises evidence on weight loss interventions in breast cancer survivors; describes ongoing randomisedclinical trials designed to test the effects of weight loss or physical activity on breast cancer survival; and provides information on available guidelines onweight and physical activity for cancer survivors.DOI: 10.1017/S0029665118000010 PMID: 29478430
