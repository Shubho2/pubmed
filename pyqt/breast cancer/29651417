GEMM are especially useful for inferencing phenocopyinformation to genetic human diseases such as breast cancer. Human breast cancer modeling in mice most commonly employs mammary epithelial-specific promoters toinvestigate gene function(s) and, in particular, putative oncogenes. Models arespecifically useful in the mammary epithelial cell in the context of the completemammary gland environment. Gene targeted knockout mice including conditionaltargeting to specific mammary cells can reveal developmental defects in mammaryorganogenesis and demonstrate the importance of putative tumor suppressor genes. Some of these models demonstrate a non-traditional type of tumor suppressionwhich involves interplay between the tumor susceptible cell and itshost/environment. These GEMM help to reveal the processes of cancer progressionbeyond those intrinsic to cancer cells. Furthermore, the, analysis of mousemodels requires appropriate consideration of mouse strain, background, andenvironmental factors. In this review, we compare aging-related factors in mouse models for breast cancer. We introduce databases of GEMM attributes and colonyfunctional variations.DOI: 10.3389/fcell.2018.00035 PMCID: PMC5884881PMID: 29651417
