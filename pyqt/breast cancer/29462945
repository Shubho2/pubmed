Recently, wedemonstrated that even in absence of ligands ERα (apoERα) binds chromatin siteswhere it regulates transcription of several protein-coding and lncRNA genes.Noteworthy, apoERα-regulated lncRNAs marginally overlap estrogen-inducedtranscripts, thus representing a new signature of luminal BC genes. By theanalysis of H3K27ac enrichment in hormone-deprived MCF-7 cells, we defined a set of Super Enhancers (SEs) occupied by apoERα, including one mapped in proximity ofthe DSCAM-AS1 lncRNA gene. This represents a paradigm of apoERα activity sinceits expression is largely unaffected by estrogenic treatment, despite the factthat E2 increases ERα binding on DSCAM-AS1 promoter. We validated the enrichment of apoERα, p300, GATA3, FoxM1 and CTCF at both DSCAM-AS1 TSS and at itsassociated SE by ChIP-qPCR. Furthermore, by analyzing MCF-7 ChIA-PET data and by 3C assays, we confirmed long range chromatin interaction between the SE and theDSCAM-AS1 TSS. Interestingly, CTCF and p300 binding showed an enrichment inhormone-depleted medium and in the presence of ERα, elucidating the dynamics ofthe estrogen-independent regulation of DSCAM-AS1 expression. The analysis of thislncRNA provides a paradigm of transcriptional regulation of a luminal specificapoERα regulated lncRNA.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19020593 PMCID: PMC5855815PMID: 29462945  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
