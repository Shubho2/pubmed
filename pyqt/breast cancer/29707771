However, resultsfrom epidemiological cohort studies are less consistent. Our objective was toassess the association between NSAID use and breast cancer risk within theEuropean Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). EPIC is aprospective cohort study initiated in 1992 in 10 European countries.Self-reported information on NSAID use at baseline has been collected in fiveEPIC countries. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios for the association of NSAID use with breast cancer incidence withadjustment for potential confounders. We also assessed effect modification bybreast cancer risk factors and examined the associations within specific breastcancer subtypes. Among the 140,981 women included in the analysis, 7% wereregularly using NSAIDs at baseline. During a median follow-up time period of 13years, 7,379 incident breast cancer cases were diagnosed (816 in situ and 6,563invasive). There were no statistically significant associations between NSAID useand breast cancer risk, overall and by subtypes. However, a statisticallysignificant interaction was observed for invasive cases between NSAID use andever use of menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT) among postmenopausal women [MHTusers: HRNSAID use  = 0.84 (0.73-0.96); non MHT users: HRNSAID use  = 1.08(0.93-1.25); pinteraction  = 0.05]. Our results indicate potential effectmodification of MHT use on the association between use of NSAIDs and breastcancer risk which deserves in-depth investigation in studies with accurate dataon both NSAID and MHT use.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31570 PMID: 29707771
