The Chemotherapy asAdjuvant for LOcally Recurrent breast cancer (CALOR) trial investigated theeffectiveness of chemotherapy (CT) after local therapy for ILRR. A report at 5years of median follow-up showed significant benefit of CT for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative ILRR, but additional follow-up was required in ER-positive ILRR.Patients and Methods CALOR was an open-label, randomized trial for patients with completely excised ILRR after unilateral breast cancer. Eligible patients wererandomly assigned to receive CT or no CT and stratified by prior CT, hormonereceptor status, and location of ILRR. Patients with hormone receptor-positiveILRR received adjuvant endocrine therapy. Radiation therapy was mandated forpatients with microscopically involved margins, and anti-human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 therapy was optional. End points were disease-free survival(DFS), overall survival, and breast cancer-free interval. Results From August2003 to January 2010, 162 patients were enrolled: 58 with ER-negative and 104with ER-positive ILRR. At 9 years of median follow-up, 27 DFS events wereobserved in the ER-negative group and 40 in the ER-positive group. The hazardratios (HR) of a DFS event were 0.29 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.67; 10-year DFS, 70% v34%, CT v no CT, respectively) in patients with ER-negative ILRR and 1.07 (95%CI, 0.57 to 2.00; 10-year DFS, 50% v 59%, respectively) in patients withER-positive ILRR ( Pinteraction = .013). HRs were 0.29 (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.67) and0.94 (95% CI, 0.47 to 1.85), respectively, for breast cancer-free interval (Pinteraction = .034) and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.19 to 1.20) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.32 to1.55), respectively, for overall survival ( Pinteraction = .53). Results for the three end points were consistent in multivariable analyses adjusting for locationof ILRR, prior CT, and interval from primary surgery. Conclusion The finalanalysis of CALOR confirms that CT benefits patients with resected ER-negativeILRR and does not support the use of CT for ER-positive ILRR.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2017.76.5719 PMCID: PMC5891132 [Available on 2019-04-10]PMID: 29443653
