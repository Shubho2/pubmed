This randomized phase 2 trialevaluated the efficacy and safety of the addition of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2inhibitor, to capecitabine in patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer and high systemic inflammation (modified Glasgow Prognostic Score [mGPS] ≥ 1).METHODS: Patients with ≤ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced or metastaticdisease or hormone receptor-positive patients with disease progression on priorhormonal therapies were randomized 1:1 to 21-day cycles of ruxolitinib (n = 76)or placebo (n = 73) plus capecitabine. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS).RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. Forruxolitinib plus capecitabine versus placebo plus capecitabine, median OS was11.2 months versus 10.9 months (log-rank test P = 0.762); median progression-freesurvival (PFS) was 4.5 months versus 2.5 months (log-rank test P = 0.151); andoverall response rate (ORR) was 28.9% versus 13.7% (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test P = 0.024), respectively. A more favorable change in health-related quality oflife (HRQoL) was observed with ruxolitinib plus capecitabine versus placebo plus capecitabine. Both regimens were generally tolerable. A higher incidence of grade3/4 anemia (25.4% vs 5.6%) and a lower incidence of grade 3/4 palmar-plantarerythrodysesthesia (1.4% vs 12.7%) occurred with ruxolitinib plus capecitabineversus placebo plus capecitabine.CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ruxolitinib to capecitabine for patients withadvanced breast cancer and high systemic inflammation was generally tolerable;ORR was numerically greater, a more favorable change in HRQoL was observed, butneither OS nor PFS was improved compared with placebo plus capecitabine.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4770-6 PMID: 29675680
