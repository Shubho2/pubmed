Comparing to free IR-782, the obtained Met modified fluorescent dye(Met-IR-782) exhibited excellent fluorescence stability, preferable photothermal conversion efficiency under 780Â nm laser irradiation and specific targeting toMCF7 (human breast adenocarcinoma cell line) cells. The fluorescence imagingability enabled in situ monitoring of the tumor accumulation of Met-IR-782. Thephotothermal cytotoxicity assays in vitro and photothermal therapy treatments in vivo indicated that Met-IR-782 could efficiently target and suppress the growthof MCF7 xenograft tumors. Hence, Met-IR-782 is a potential fluorescent agent for NIR imaging-guided cancer photothermal therapy in clinical application. This workhighlights the prospect of using light absorbing agents for NIR imaging-guidedphotothermal therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s10103-018-2532-7 PMID: 29948451
