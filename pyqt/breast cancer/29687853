Huhaibei2017@126.com.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biological role and clinical significance of longnon-coding RNAs (lncRNA) LINC01116 in breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the public database Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the breast cancer data set GSE54002 was screened for differentially expressed lncRNA LINC01116 in breast cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues. QuantitativeReal-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expressionof LINC01116 in 64 breast cancer tissues and 30 normal breast tissues. Level ofLINC01116 and clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer were statistically analyzed. The effect of LINC01116 in breast cancer cells was investigated afterknockdown of LINC01116. Luciferase reporter gene was further used to investigate the mechanism of endogenous RNA (ceRNA).RESULTS: Results of GSE54002 showed that the expression of LINC01116 in breastcancer tissues was significantly increased. In clinical samples, the level ofLINC01116 in patients with breast cancer was significantly increased, which wascorrelated with the overall survival, tumor size and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage in patients, but not correlated with the age, sex and lymph node metastasis(p>0.05). LINC01116 can act as an endogenous sponge and bind directly to miR-145,resulting in the up-regulation of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), a target gene ofmiR-145.CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA LINC01116 is highly expressed in breast cancer and is a newprognostic biomarker in breast cancer. Our study establishes a new link betweenLINC01116, miR-145 and ESR1.PMID: 29687853
