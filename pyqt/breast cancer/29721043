Using immunohistochemistry, we found that TRIM32 expression isupregulated in breast cancer tissues and that it correlates with advanced stageand poor prognosis. TRIM32 is also overexpressed in 4/7 breast cancer cell lines.CCK8 and colony formation assays showed that TRIM32 depletion inhibitedproliferation and colony formation in the T47D cell line, while TRIM32overexpression promoted MCF-7 cell growth and colony formation. Cell viabilityand Annexin V/PI staining demonstrated that TRIM32 maintained breast cancer cell survival and reduced apoptosis rate when cells were treated with cisplatin.Western blot analysis demonstrated that TRIM32 overexpression resulted in anupregulation of p-IκB, p-p65, cIAP1, and cIAP2 and a downregulation of p21 andp27 in MCF-7 cells. TRIM32 depletion in T47D cells demonstrated the oppositeresults, suggesting that TRIM32 may activate the NF-κB pathway. The NF-κBinhibitor BAY 11-7082 blocked the effects of TRIM32 on cisplatin resistance andcIAP1/2 protein regulation. Taken together, the present study demonstrates thatTRIM32 downregulates p21/p27 and upregulates IAP family proteins to facilitatebreast cancer cell growth and inhibit drug-induced apoptosis, possibly throughthe NF-κB signaling pathway.DOI: 10.7150/jca.22390 PMCID: PMC5929078PMID: 29721043
