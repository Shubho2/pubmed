[Epub ahead of print]Hepatitis B virus infection and the risk of cancer in the elderly US population.Mahale P(1), Engels EA(1), Koshiol J(1).Author information: (1)Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Associations with other cancers are not established. We systematically assessedassociations between HBV infection and cancers in the US elderly population. Weconducted a case-control study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and EndResults (SEER)-Medicare database in US adults aged ≥66 years. Cases (N=1,825,316)were people with first cancers diagnosed in SEER registries (1993-2013). Controls(N=200,000) were randomly selected, cancer-free individuals who werefrequency-matched to cases on age, sex, race, and calendar year. Associationswith HBV infection (ascertained by Medicare claims) were assessed by logisticregression. HBV prevalence was higher in cases than controls (0.6% vs. 0.5%). HBVwas positively associated with cancers of the stomach (Adjusted odds ratio[aOR]=1.19; 95% confidence intervals [CI]=1.03-1.37), anus (1.66; 1.17-2.33),liver (10.6; 9.66-11.6), intrahepatic bile ducts (1.67; 1.18-2.37), nasopharynx(2.08; 1.33-3.25), as well as myelodysplastic syndrome (1.26; 1.07-1.49) anddiffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1.24; 1.06-1.46). Inverse associationswere observed with female breast (aOR=0.86; 95%CI=0.76-0.98) and prostate (0.81; 0.73-0.91) cancers, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (0.77; 0.62-0.96).Associations were maintained in sensitivity analyses conducted in people without claims for cirrhosis, or hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus infections. HBV infection is associated with increased risk of cancers other than HCC, suchas bile duct cancers and DLBCL. The biological mechanisms by which HBV may leadto these cancers need to be explored.
