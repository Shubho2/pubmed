We therefore examined whether patients with acromegaly are at higher risk of cancer.Design: A nationwide cohort study (1978 to 2010) including 529 acromegaly caseswas performed. Incident cancer diagnoses and mortality were compared withnational rates estimating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). A meta-analysisof cancer SIRs from 23 studies (including the present one) was performed.Results: The cohort study identified 81 cases of cancer after exclusion of cases diagnosed within the first year [SIR 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9 to1.4]. SIRs were 1.4 (95% CI, 0.7 to 2.6) for colorectal cancer, 1.1 (95% CI, 0.5 to 2.1) for breast cancer, and 1.4 (95% CI, 0.6 to 2.6) for prostate cancer.Whereas overall mortality was elevated in acromegaly (SIR 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to1.6), cancer-specific mortality was not. The meta-analysis yielded an SIR ofoverall cancer of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8). SIRs were elevated for colorectalcancer, 2.6 (95% CI, 1.7 to 4.0); thyroid cancer, 9.2 (95% CI, 4.2 to 19.9);breast cancer, 1.6 (1.1 to 2.3); gastric cancer, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.9); andurinary tract cancer, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.3). In general, cancer SIR was higherin single-center studies and in studies with <10 cancer cases.Conclusions: Cancer incidence rates were slightly elevated in patients withacromegaly in our study, and this finding was supported by the meta-analysis of23 studies, although it also suggested the presence of selection bias in someearlier studies.DOI: 10.1210/jc.2017-02457 PMID: 29590449
