However,the risk of late-onset HF is debatable and mainly based on observational studies.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of anthracycline-basedchemotherapy on long-term risk of clinical HF.METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 1990 and 1998 the Danish Breast Cancer CooperativeGroup (DBCG) 89D trial randomized 980 Danish women with early breast cancer toadjuvant cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil or cyclophosphamide,methotrexate, and fluorouracil. Incident HF was the primary endpoint obtainedfrom Danish administrative registries. Follow-up ended at December 2014. The riskof HF was evaluated in a cumulative incidence analysis and a Fine-Grayproportional hazards model. Median follow-up time was 16.9 years [interquartilerange (IQR) 3.7-20.9]. In the epirubicin treatment group, 23 new cases of HF wereidentified vs. 9 in the non-epirubicin group corresponding to incidence rates per1000 patient-years of 3.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5-5.6] vs. 1.4 (95% CI 0.7-2.7). The cumulative incidence of HF was higher in the epirubicin treatmentgroup compared with the non-epirubicin group (P < 0.01), yielding a hazard ratio of 3.00 (95% CI 1.39-6.49, P < 0.01) for HF associated with epirubicin. Themedian dose of epirubicin was 451.9 mg/m2 (IQR 400.0-523.5).CONCLUSIONS: Anthracycline-based chemotherapy is associated with a three-foldincreased risk of late-onset clinical HF relative to non-anthracyclinechemotherapy in this randomized clinical trial, but overall risk is low.© 2018 The Authors.
