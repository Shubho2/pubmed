NAC was recommended for locallyadvanced breast cancer (94%) and for downstaging to enable breast conservingsurgery (BCS) (75%). Despite willingness to downstage, 64% of cliniciansroutinely recommended NAC when systemic therapy was indicated preoperatively.Reported reasons to refrain from NAC are comorbidities (68%), age >70 years(52%), and WHO-performance status ≥2 (93%). Opinions on NAC and surgicalmanagement were inconclusive; while 75% recommends NAC to enable BCS, some statedthat BCS after NAC increases the risk of a non-radical resection (21%), surgical complications (9%) and recurrence of disease (5%).CONCLUSION: This article emphasizes the need for more consensus among specialistson the indications for NAC in early BC patients. Unambiguous and evidence-basedtreatment information could improve doctor-patient communication, supporting the patient in chemotherapy timing decision-making.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
