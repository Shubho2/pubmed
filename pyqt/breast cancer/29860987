Breast cancer risk is ∼30% heritable and >170 genetic loci have been associated with breast cancer traits. However, the majority of candidategenes have poorly defined mechanistic roles in breast cancer biology. Researchindicates that breast cancer risk modifiers directly impact cancer cells, yet it is equally plausible that some modifier alleles impact the nonmalignant TME. The objective of this review is to examine the list of current breast cancercandidate genes that may modify breast cancer risk and outcome through the TME.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
