Using an in vivo CRISPR screen targeting RNA-bindingproteins, we identified PHD finger protein 5A (PHF5A) as a key splicing factorinvolved in tumor progression. PHF5A expression was frequently upregulated inbreast cancer and correlated with poor survival, and knockdown of PHF5Asignificantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and tumor formation.PHF5A was required for SF3b spliceosome stability and linked the complex tohistones, and the PHF5A-SF3b complex modulated AS changes in apoptotic signaling.In addition, expression of a short truncated FAS-activated serine/threoninekinase (FASTK) protein was increased after PHF5A ablation and facilitatedFas-mediated apoptosis. This PHF5A-modulated FASTK-AS axis was widely present in breast cancer specimens, particularly those of the triple-negative subtype. Takentogether, our findings reveal that PHF5A serves as an epigenetic suppressor ofapoptosis and thus provides a mechanistic basis for breast cancer progression andmay be a valuable therapeutic target.Significance: This study provides anepigenetic mechanistic basis for the aggressive biology of breast cancer andidentifies a translatable therapeutic target.
