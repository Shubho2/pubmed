Patients with ULL were recruited from twooutpatient clinics.RESULTS: We derived the ULLQoL scale from a pool of 98 items generated bypatients. After further consultation, we produced the draft ULLQoL scale. Forvalidation, 103 patients with ULL completed the draft scale and two generichealth measures: SF-36 and ED-5D-3L. Psychometric analysis identified twocomponents, physical and emotional well-being, with good internal consistency andtest-retest reliability. Significant correlations with SF-36, EQ-5D-3L, andpercentage excess limb volume confirmed construct validity. The ULLQoL scaleshowed good responsiveness to change reported by lymphedema patients and moderateto large effect sizes.CONCLUSION: The 14-item ULLQoL scale is a robust ULL-specific measure that isfeasible and valid to use in both the clinical and research settings.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
