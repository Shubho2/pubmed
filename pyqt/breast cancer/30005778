Autologous flaps allow women to avoid prosthetic devices, using skinand fat to replace breast tissue. The increasing frequency of nipple-sparingmastectomy, autologous fat grafting, use of acellular dermal matrices, andprepectoral prosthetic reconstruction have enhanced aesthetic outcomes. Breastconservation outcomes have been enhanced by immediate oncoplastic breastreconstruction to reduce the risks of contour deformities and breast asymmetry,and maintain excellent, oncologically safe, aesthetic outcomes.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
