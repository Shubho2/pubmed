This study was conducted to identify predictors for tumorresponse in the breast and axilla.METHODS: All female patients with nonmetastatic, noninflammatory breast cancerreceiving NST between 2003-2013 at the Catharina Cancer Institute in Eindhoven,The Netherlands, were included.RESULTS: The majority of 216 of the 337 patients receiving NST (65%) presentedwith a cT2 tumor. In 159 patients (47%), the axilla was clinically node positive.A pathologic complete response (pCR) in the breast was achieved in 83 patients(24.6%), and a pCR in the axilla in 65 node-positive patients (40.9%). Thetriple-negative (OR 4.29, 95% CI 2.15-8.55) and hormone receptor(HR)-negative/HER2-positive tumors (OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.59-8.75) were associatedwith in-breast pCR. Patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) were lesslikely to experience in-breast pCR (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.73) than those withinvasive ductal cancer. Axillary pCR was found in 65 clinically node-positivepatients (41%). Axillary pCR was more likely to occur inHR-positive/HER2-positive (OR 6.24, 95% CI 1.86-20.90) andHR-negative/HER2-positive tumors (OR 6.41, 95% CI 1.95-21.06), compared toHER2-negative disease. In-breast pCR was strongly associated with axillary pCR(OR 10.89, 95% CI 4.20-28.22).CONCLUSION: Response to NST in the breast and axilla is largely determined byreceptor status, with high pCR rates occurring in HER2-positive andtriple-negative tumors. For axillary pCR, in-breast pCR and HER2-positive diseaseare the most important predictive factors.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13085 PMID: 30033607
