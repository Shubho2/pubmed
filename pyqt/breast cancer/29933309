[Epub ahead ofprint]The Effectiveness of the Sport "Dragon Boat Racing" in Reducing the Risk ofLymphedema Incidence: An Observational Study.Iacorossi L(1), Gambalunga F, Molinaro S, De Domenico R, Giannarelli D, Fabi A.Author information: (1)Author Affiliations: "Regina Elena" National Cancer Institute, Rome (DrsIacorossi and Gambalunga and Ms De Domenico); "Hospice San Francesco," Rieti (Dr Molinaro); and Biostatistics Unit (Dr Giannarelli) and Division of MedicalOncology A (Dr Fabi), "Regina Elena" National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.BACKGROUND: Upper extremity lymphedema is a complication that often occurs inwomen with breast cancer as a result of surgery and/or radiotherapy. Some studiesreport that a boating activity known as the "dragon boat" sport can benefit thesewomen.AIM: The aim of this study was to assess whether this type of sport prevents orreduces lymphedema, its impact on quality of life (QoL), and the possiblepredictors of this condition.METHODS: This was an observational study of 2 groups: group A (women whoparticipated in dragon boat racing for at least 6 months) and group B (women who participated in other forms of physical exercise biweekly). Data were collectedat the National Cancer Institute of Rome and the lake of Castel Gandolfo fromJune to October 2016. The instruments used were a questionnaire created forsociodemographic and clinical data, the European Organisation for Research andTreatment of Cancer Core Questionnaire for evaluating QoL, and a tape measureapplied to estimate the local lymphedema.RESULTS: One hundred women participated in the study. Lymphedema incidence ingroup A was 4.0% (2 of 50), whereas in group B it was 26.0% (13 of 50). Women whoparticipated in dragon boat racing also reported a healthier lifestyle, lowerbody mass index, and a better QoL (set point: 61.8 group B vs 80.0 group A).CONCLUSIONS: The dragon boat sport participants had more positive clinical andQoL outcomes than did the women who did not participate in that sportingactivity.IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: It would be important to make women withbreast cancer aware of the practice of dragon boat racing.DOI: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000615 PMID: 29933309
