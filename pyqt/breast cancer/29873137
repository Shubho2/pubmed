[Epub ahead of print]Is being diagnosed at a dedicated breast assessment unit associated with areduction in the time to diagnosis for symptomatic breast cancer patients?Jiang L(1)(2), Gilbert J(3), Langley H(4), Moineddin R(5), Groome PA(1)(2).Author information: (1)Division of Cancer Care and Epidemiology, Cancer Research Institute at Queen'sUniversity, Kingston, ON, Canada.(2)Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, ON, Canada.(3)Cancer Care Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada.(4)South East Regional Cancer Program, Kingston General Hospital, Kingston, ON,Canada.(5)Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto,ON, Canada.The length of the cancer diagnostic interval can affect a patient's survival and psychosocial well-being. Ontario Diagnostic Assessment Units (DAUs) were designedto expedite the diagnostic process through coordinated care. We examined theeffect of DAUs on the diagnostic interval among female patients with symptomatic breast cancer in Ontario using the Ontario Cancer Registry linked toadministrative healthcare data. The diagnostic interval was defined as the timefrom patients' first referral or test to the cancer diagnosis. DAU use wasdetermined based on the hospital where the breast biopsy/surgery was performed.Multivariable quantile regression and logistic regression analyses adjusted forpossible confounders. Forty-seven per cent of patients were diagnosed in a DAUand 53% in usual care (UC). DAUs achieved the Canadian timeliness targets moreoften than UC (71.7% vs. 58.1%, respectively). DAU use was associated with a10-day (95% CI: 7.8-11.9) reduction in the median diagnostic interval. Thiseffect increased to 19 days for patients at the 75th percentile and 22 days forthose at the 90th percentile of the diagnostic interval distribution. Use of anOntario DAU is associated with a shorter time to diagnosis in patients withsymptomatic breast cancer, especially for those who would otherwise wait thelongest.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ecc.12864 PMID: 29873137
