However, its clinical developmentwas discouraged due to its low biological activities and poor solubility. Weprepared lup-20(29)-en-3β,28-di-yl-nitrooxy acetate (NBT), a derivative of BT,that was chemically modified at position 3 of ring A and C-28 by introducing aNO-releasing moiety. This study mainly explored the mechanism of NBT in treating breast cancer through the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy inmitochondria. NBT possessed a potent antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 cellsboth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, NBT affected cell death through themitochondrial apoptosis pathway and autophagy. NBT induced cell cycle arrest inthe G0/G1 phase by decreasing the expression of cyclin D1. It also inducedmitochondrial apoptosis by increasing the expression of Bax, caspase-9, andpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and mitochondrial membrane potential loss and leaksof cytochrome c (Cyt C) from mitochondria in MCF-7 cells and decreasing theexpression of mitochondrial Bcl-2. We further demonstrated whether chloroquine(CQ), which inhibits the degradation of autophagosome induced by NBT, affects theproliferation of MCF-7 cells compared with NBT. The experiments inferred that thecombination of NBT and CQ significantly promoted MCF-7 cell mitochondria todivide and Cyt C to be released from mitochondria to the cytoplasm, resulting in an increased apoptosis rate. The in vivo experiments showed that NBT inhibitedthe growth of MCF-7 tumor via the apoptosis pathway, and its effect was similarto 5-fluorouracil.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-017-0255-5 PMCID: PMC5833777PMID: 29445224
