Electronic address: rahbarif@modares.ac.ir.Breast cancer is the leading cause of mortality among all cancers. HER2, humanepidermal growth factor receptors type 2, a receptor tyrosine kinase that inducesinterminable cell proliferation, is overexpressed in 20-25 percent of breastcancers. In spite of significant progress in nanomedicine in the past decade,being subjected to genetic drift that hides many paramount epitopes has rendered targeting HER2 as a big challenge. In the present study, we developed monovalent and bivalent monospecific along with bivalent bispecific VHH targeting different epitopes on HER2, and showed that bivalent bispecific VHH has the highestaffinity among other tested modalities. Then we covalently coupled VHHs to thefluorescent labeled liposomal nanoparticle to produce targeted liposomes. Basedon flow cytometry results, bivalent bispecific VHH targeted liposomes showed the highest fluorescent intensity, on HER2 breast cancer cells. Liposomes conjugated to bivalent monospecific VHH exhibited enhanced affinity toward HER2 positivecell lines compared to monovalent targeted liposomes, with bivalent bispecificliposomes appearing as the most robust probe.Copyright Â© 2018.
