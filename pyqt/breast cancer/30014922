[Epubahead of print]Tetrahydroindolocarbazoles (THICZs) as new class of urokinase (uPA) inhibitors:Synthesis, anticancer evaluation, DNA-damage determination, and molecularmodelling study.El-Sharief MAMS(1), El-Naggar MH(2), Ahmed EM(3), El-Messery SM(4), MahmoudAE(5), Ali MM(5), Salem LM(6), Mahrous KF(6), El Sayed MT(7).Author information: (1)Department of Applied Organic Chemistry, National Research Centre, 12622Dokki, Giza, Egypt; Chemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, King KhaledUniversity, Saudi Arabia.(2)Chemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, University of Sharjah, Sharjah27272, United Arab Emirates.(3)Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Al Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt.(4)Department of Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, 35516 Mansoura, Egypt.

Electronic address: mardia.elsayed2016@gmail.com.Tetrahydroindolocarbazoles (THICZs) with versatile substituents, have beendesigned, synthesized, structure characterized, then investigated for theirin-vitro anticancer screening, urokinase inhibition (uPA) evaluated, DNA-damagedetermination was further explored. Compounds 5, 8, 10 and 17 displayed the most promising antitumor activities against the breast cancer cell line as compared tothe standard drug, doxorubicin with IC50 = 5.24 ± 0.37, 4.00 ± 0.52, 7.20 ± 0.90 and 9.60 ± 1.10 µg/ml (versus 3.30 ± 0.48 µg/ml for doxorubicin). Compounds 5, 8,10 and 17 represents the most significant uPA inhibitors of our study with IC50of 3.80, 2.70. 4.75, 10.80 (ng/ml) respectively. The expression levels of CDKN2A gene were decreased in 8, 10 and 17 cell lines as compared to those in positivecontrol samples. Cell lines treated with 5, 8, 10 and 17 clearly observed a high score of damaged DNA cells. A deeper examination revealed that our hetroaromaticsshowed an extensive hydrogen bonding interactions that is required in the Spocket which is important for activity Arg 217, Gly 219, Gly 216, Lys 143 and Ser190. So we present THICZs as promising uPA inhibitors expected as significantpromise for further development as anti-invasiveness drugs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
