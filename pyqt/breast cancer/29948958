We soughtto determine whether CD70 + subpopulation in human breast cancers represents the CSCs accounting for distant metastasis.METHODS: We measured the expression levels of CD70 in breast cancer cell linesand 122 primary breast cancer samples. We characterized the functional roles ofCD70 + subpopulation in distant metastasis of breast cancers.RESULTS: We observed a distinct pattern of CD70 expression in a panel of primary breast carcinoma samples, indicating that CD70 serves as a biomarker oflung-specific metastasis. CD70- and CD70+ cell populations isolated from breastcancer cell lines exhibited epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, respectively. CD70+ cells, but not CD70- cells, possessed self-renewal and differentiationpotentials. Tumorsphere formation in suspension cultures and in vivotumorigenicity were significantly greater in CD70+ cells than in CD70- cells.Furthermore, the development of lung metastases induced by orthotopic injectionwas markedly increased in mice inoculated with CD70 + cells. CD70 contributed to the promotion of lung metastases by enhancing self-renewal potential ofCD70 + cells.CONCLUSIONS: We isolated CSCs from primary human breast cancers and found thatCD70 + subpopulations mediate lung-specific metastasis. These findings might beused to aid in selection of patients for postoperative adjuvant therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0880-6 PMID: 29948958
