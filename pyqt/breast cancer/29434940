China.The present study investigated the anticancer functions of ursolic acid (UA) and its novel derivatives, with a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic scaffold and theprivileged fragment at the C-28 position on apoptosis induction, cellproliferation and cell cycle in human BC lines. UA was chemically modified in thepresent study to increase its antitumor activity and bioavailability. A novel UA derivative, FZU3010, was synthesized using a nitrogen-containing heterocyclicscaffold and a privileged fragment at the C-28 position. Sulforhodimine B assays were used to measure the effect of UA and different concentrations of FZU3010 on the viability of breast cancer (BC) SUM149PT and HCC1937 cells. FZU3010significantly repressed the proliferation of the two cancer cell lines in adose-dependent manner, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 4-6 µM,and exhibited decreased cytotoxicity compared with vehicle-treated cell lines.The effect of FZU3010 on cell cycle distribution and cellular apoptosis was also investigated. The results of this investigation indicated that FZU3010significantly increased the number of SUM149PT and breast cancer HCC1937 cells inthe G0/G1 phase in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, at a concentration of 5µM, the capability of FZU3010 to induce BC apoptosis was significantly higherthan the capability of UA. Thus, the results of the current study indicated that FZU3010 induced apoptosis in BC cells, together with induction of cell cyclearrest at the S and G0/G1 phase. FZU3010 may therefore be considered as apotential therapeutic agent for the treatment of BC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7578 PMCID: PMC5776946PMID: 29434940
