Microfluidictechnologies deliver microscale control of fluids and cells, and have aidedcancer therapy as point-of-care devices for the diagnosis of breast and prostate cancers. However, a few microfluidic devices are developed to study malignantglioma. The ability of these platforms to accurately replicate the complexmicroenvironmental and extracellular conditions prevailing in the brain andfacilitate the measurement of biological phenomena with high resolution and in a high-throughput manner could prove useful for studying glioma progression. These attributes, coupled with their relatively simple fabrication process, make themattractive for use as point-of-care diagnostic devices for detection andtreatment of GBM. Here, the current issues that plague GBM research andtreatment, as well as the current state of the art in glioma detection andtherapy, are reviewed. Finally, opportunities are identified for implementingmicrofluidic technologies into research and diagnostics to facilitate the rapiddetection and better therapeutic targeting of GBM.DOI: 10.1002/adbi.201700221 PMCID: PMC5959050PMID: 29780878
