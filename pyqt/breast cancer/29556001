Epub 2018Mar 19.A tumor-myeloid cell axis, mediated via the cytokines IL-1α and TSLP, promotesthe progression of breast cancer.Kuan EL(1), Ziegler SF(2).Author information: (1)Immunology Program, Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA.(2)Immunology Program, Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA.sziegler@benaroyaresearch.org.Erratum in    Nat Immunol. 2018 Jun 18;:.Tumors actively manipulate the immune response through the production of factors that attract immune cells and subsequently alter their ability to recognize andeffectively remove the tumor. While this mechanism for evading the immune system is an important aspect of tumor survival, the factors that serve as primarygrowth factors for the tumor are less understood. Here we demonstrate apreviously unknown mechanism by which breast-cancer cells manipulatetumor-infiltrating myeloid cells to maintain their survival. Tumor-derivedinterleukin 1α (IL-1α), acting on infiltrating myeloid cells, induced theexpression of a critical tumor survival factor, the cytokine TSLP. TSLP promoted the survival of the tumor cells through induction of the expression of theanti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2. TSLP signaling was also required for metastasis tothe lungs. These studies define a novel IL-1α-TSLP-mediated crosstalk betweentumor-infiltrating myeloid cells and tumor cells in the control of metastaticbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41590-018-0066-6 PMCID: PMC5864553 [Available on 2018-09-19]PMID: 29556001
