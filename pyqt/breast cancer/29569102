This study investigated their PA adherence by acculturation level (vs. non-Hispanic White (NHW) survivors). Onehundred ninety five Chinese and 202 NHW breast cancer survivors (stage 0-III)responded to a cross-sectional survey including a self-reported PA questionnaire.PA adherence referred to meeting PA recommendations for cancer survivors.Acculturation among Chinese was defined by proxies of U.S. residency, Englishproficiency, and interview language. Logistic regression was performed to examinefactors associated with PA adherence. More-acculturated Chinese survivors' PAadherence rate was 76%. Less-acculturated Chinese survivors' adherence rate (60%)was significantly lower than that of NHWs (80%) (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.19, 0.75).Less-acculturated Chinese survivors were also less likely to engage invigorous-intensity PA than NHWs (p < 0.01). Future research on less-acculturated Chinese survivors' motivation for PA to promote their adherence is needed.DOI: 10.1007/s10903-018-0721-x PMID: 29569102
