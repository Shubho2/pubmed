On the other hand, wild-type (WT)animals treated in the same fashion develop pulmonary and liver metastases within20Â days of surgery. To develop an in vitro system which would mimic the in vivomodel and allow exploration of factors controlling tumor invasion as a precursor to in vivo metastasis, we have developed and characterized a two-phase culturesystem.METHODS: Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) from WT, CD200KO orCD200R1KO mice were admixed with T lymphocytes from tumor-immunized mice andcultured in collagen gels. Tumor cells were subsequently seeded in fresh mediumabove this gel 1d later. We then investigated the regulation of tumor invasionfrom the liquid to the gel layer. Tumor cells were measured in the gel layerfollowing collagenase digestion and cultured at limiting dilution-an aliquot ofthe digest was also analyzed for cytokine levels in ELISA.RESULTS: BMMSCs from WT, CD200KO and CD200R1KO mice all augmented seeding/growth of EMT6 and 4THM tumor cells into the collagen matrix. Inclusion of IL-6 andIL-17 in the gel matrix was associated with increased invasion of tumor cellsinto this layer. Inclusion of DLN cells from EMT6 immune or 4THM immune micefurther modified tumor invasion, with increased tumor numbers seen using stromal elements from CD200 and CD200R1KO mice and DLN from 4THM immune, whileCD200R1KO-derived DLN of EMT6 immune mice attenuated tumor invasion, despiteinclusion of IL-6/IL-17 in the gel layer.CONCLUSION: Multiple factors can regulate tumor invasion, includingmicro-environmental stromal elements, IL-6/IL-17, and signals from tumor-derived DLN cells.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0851-y PMID: 29532324
