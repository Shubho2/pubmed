The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) intumor tissues was associated with chemotherapeutic effectiveness by mediatingcellular longevity. In this study, we screened the prognostic values of oxidativestress-related genes in ovarian cancer patients received platinum-basedchemotherapy, and conducted a prognostic gene signature composing of three genes,TXNRD1, GLA and GSTZ1. This three-gene signature was significantly associatedwith overall survival (OS), but not progression-free survival (PFS), in bothtraining (n=276) and validation cohorts (n=230). Interestingly, we found that theprognostic value of three-gene signature was reinforced in platinum-sensitivepatients. Subgroup analysis further suggested that patients with elder age,higher pathological grades and advanced tumor stages in low-risk score groupcould benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy. Functional analysis showed thatthe inactivation of several signaling pathways, including cell cycle,insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) /mTOR and Fas pathways, was affected by threegenes. Collectively, our results provided evidence that a panel of threeoxidative stress-related gene signature had prognostic values for ovarian cancer patients received platinum-based chemotherapy.DOI: 10.18632/aging.101473 PMCID: PMC6046245PMID: 29910195
