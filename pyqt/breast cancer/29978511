[Epub ahead of print]Newly Characterized Motile Sperm Domain-Containing Protein 2 Promotes HumanBreast Cancer Metastasis.Salem Y(1), Yacov N(1), Propheta-Meiran O(1), Breitbart E(1), Mendel I(1).Author information: (1)VBL Therapeutics, 8 Hasatat St., Modi'in, 7178106, Israel.Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause ofcancer death among women worldwide. Breast cancer metastasis results in poorprognosis and increased mortality, but the mechanisms of breast cancer metastasisare yet to be fully resolved. Identifying distinctive proteins that regulatemetastasis might be targeted to improve therapy in breast cancer. We previouslydescribed MOSPD2 as a surface membrane protein that regulates monocyte migration in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that MOSPD2 has amajor role in breast cancer cell migration and metastasis. MOSPD2 expression was highly elevated in invasive and metastatic breast cancer while it was absent orresidual in normal tissue and in primary in situ tumors. In vitro experimentsshowed that silencing MOSPD2 in different breast cancer cell lines significantly inhibited cancer cell chemotaxis migration. Mechanistically, we found thatsilencing MOSPD2 profoundly abated phosphorylation events that are involved inbreast tumor cell chemotaxis. In vivo, MOSPD2-silenced breast cancer cellsexhibited marked impaired metastasis to the lungs. These results indicate thatMOSPD2 plays a key role in the migration and metastasis of breast cancer cellsand may be used to prevent the spreading of breast cancer cells and to mediatetheir death.
