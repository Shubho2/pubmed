We have developed a therapeutic HER2 siRNA delivered using mesoporous silica nanoparticles modified with polymers and conjugated with HER2targeting antibodies. Our previous studies have shown that our HER2 siRNAnanoparticles could overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance to trastuzumab andlapatinib in HER2-positive breast cancers. In this study, we investigated theeffect of long-term (7 months) treatment using our therapeutic HER2 siRNA. Evenafter the removal of HER2 siRNA, the long-term treated cells grew much slower(67% increase in doubling time) than cells that have not received any treatment. The treated cells did not undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition or showedenrichment of tumor initiating cells. Unlike trastuzumab and lapatinib, whichinduced resistance in BT474 cells after 6 months of treatment, HER2 siRNA did notinduce resistance to HER2 siRNA, trastuzumab, or lapatinib. HER2 ablation withHER2 siRNA prevented reactivation of HER2 signaling that was observed in cellsresistant to lapatinib. Altogether, our results indicate that a HER2 siRNA based therapeutic provides a more durable inhibition of HER2 signaling in vitro and canpotentially be more effective than the existing therapeutic monoclonal antibodiesand small molecule inhibitors.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198141 PMCID: PMC5991725PMID: 29879129
