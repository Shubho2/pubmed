Denosumab is a monoclonal antibodythat targets the pathway for osteoclast formation and activation, indicated forthe prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases, aswell as for the treatment of giant cell tumor of bone. We report a patient whopresented with aggressive bone recurrence of breast cancer 12 years after heroriginal diagnosis, showing a transformed histology that included multinucleated OGCs, and that was refractory to traditional therapy. Misdiagnosed with atumor-to-tumor metastasis of breast cancer to a giant cell tumor of bone, she wastreated with denosumab for her presumed primary bone disease and had a remarkableclinical and radiological response. To the best of our knowledge, this is thefirst report of breast cancer with OGCs occurring initially in a metastasis whileabsent in the original tumor and the first description of its successfultreatment with denosumab. This case sheds light on the development of giant cellsin the tumor microenvironment and suggests the potential use of denosumab in the management of cancers with giant cell elements.DOI: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000612 PMID: 29481473
