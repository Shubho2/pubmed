The potential of COX-2 inhibitors in cancerprevention and treatment has been shown repeatedly; however, their clinical useis limited due to toxicity. PGE2 signals via EP receptors 1-4, whose functionsare analyzed in current research in search for targeted anti-PG therapies. EP2and EP4 rather promote tumorigenesis, while the role of EP3, especially in breastcancer, is not yet clear and both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects have beendescribed. Our study evaluates EP3 receptor expression in sporadic breast cancer and its association with clinicopathological parameters, progression-free andoverall survival.METHODS: Two hundred eighty-nine sporadic breast cancer samples without primarydistant metastasis were immunohistochemically analyzed for EP3 receptorexpression. Tissue was stained with primary anti-EP3-antibodies. Immunoreactivitywas quantified by the immunoreactivity-score (IRS); samples with an IRS ≥ 2scored as EP3 positive. Chi-squared and Mann-Whitney-U test were used forcomparison of data; Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox-regression were used forsurvival analyses.RESULTS: EP3 receptor was expressed in 205 of 289 samples analyzed (70.9%). EP3receptor expression was not associated with clinicopathological parameters (e. g.tumor size, hormone receptors, lymph node status). Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a significant association of EP3 positivity with improved progression-freesurvival (p = 0.002) and improved overall survival (p = 0.001) after up to10 years. Cox regression analysis confirmed EP3 positivity as a significantprognostic factor even when other known prognosticators were accounted for.CONCLUSIONS: In sporadic breast cancer, EP3 receptor expression is notsignificantly associated with clinicopathological parameters but is a significantprognostic factor for improved progression-free and overall survival. However,the functional aspects of EP3 receptor in breast cancer and the way how EP3 mayoppose the pro-tumorigenic effects of PGE2 elevation and COX-2 overexpression arenot fully understood so far. Further studies aiming at identification of thefactors regulated by EP3 are necessary to evaluate the possibility of targetingEP3 in future anti-tumor therapy in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4286-9 PMCID: PMC5902996PMID: 29661238
