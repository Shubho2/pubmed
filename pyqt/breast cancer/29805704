China.The increasing frequency of early breast cancer cases has driven an increasingnumber of patients to choose immediate reconstruction with an autologous flap.Omentum-flap-based breast reconstruction is a unique strategy that is highlysuitable for repairing moderate tissue defects. However, all available evidencecomes from individual reports with small numbers of cases, and the overalleffectiveness and safety of the procedure have yet to be reported. Here, wereported 7 cases of laparoscopically harvested omental free flap breastreconstruction and performed a systematic review to assess the applicability and safety of this approach. The data were gathered from MEDLINE, Ovid, GoogleScholar and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database. In total, wecombined 15 articles (410 cases) for analysis. The data revealed that almost all patients (87.6%) were reported to have undergone laparoscopy instead oflaparotomy; pedicle flaps were used in 90.9% of the cases, while only 5 (37cases) used free flaps for reconstruction; and 96.6% (396/410) of allreconstruction procedures were immediate. Almost all of these cases had a smalltumour burden (T0/Tis/T1 59.8%; T2 36.8%), and the distribution of tumourlocation was similar among the four quadrants. The cosmetic outcomes weredesirable in most cases (83.9%). There were 41 complications identified in thedataset: partial graft necrosis accounted for the largest percentage (41.5%) ofall events, followed by skin necrosis (19.5%), haematoma (12.2%) and woundinfection (9.8%). During the follow-up period, which had a short median duration,2 cases of tumour recurrence were reported. Overall, our systematic review found that omentum-flap-based breast reconstruction could achieve a satisfactoryaesthetic outcome, especially for small breasts and tissue replacement afterbreast-conserving surgery, and the safety of the procedure was also acceptable.DOI: 10.7150/jca.25556 PMCID: PMC5968766PMID: 29805704
