The antiproliferative activity was assessed in 2D and 3-dimensionalcell-culture-model. The migratory-behaviors of the cells were determined bymigration assay. The expression levels of CyclinD1,GSK3a/b, P-AMPK, MMP9, andE-cadherin were studied by qRT-PCR and/or Western blotting. The anti-inflammatoryof nano-curcumin was assessed, while antioxidant activity was evaluated bymalondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and totalthiols (T-SH). To understand dynamic behavior of genes, we reconstructed aBoolean network, while the robustness of this model was evaluated by Hammingdistance. phytosomal-curcumin suppressed cell-growth followed by tumor-shrinkage in 3D model through perturbation of AMP-activated protein kinase. Curcuminreduced the invasiveness of MCF-7 through perturbation of E-cadherin. Moreover,phytosomal-curcumin inhibited the tumor growth in xerograph model. Histologicalstaining of tumor tissues revealed vascular disruption and RBC extravasation,necrosis, tumor stroma, and inflammation. Co-treatment of curcumin and 5-FUreduced the lipid-peroxidation and increased MDA/SOD level. Of note, curcuminreduced cyclinD-expression in breast cancer cell treated with thrombin, andactivates AMPK in a time-dependent manner. Also suppression of AMPK abrogatedinhibitory effect of phytosomal-curcumin on thrombin-induced cyclin D1over-expression, suggesting that AMPK is essential for anti-proliferative effect of this agent in breast cancer. Our finding demonstrated that phytosomal-curcuminantagonizes cell growth and migration, induced by thrombin through AMP-Kinase in breast cancer, supporting further-investigations on the therapeutic potential of this novel anticancer agent in treatment of breast cancer.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jcb.26796 PMID: 29600521
