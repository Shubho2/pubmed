Tumor microenvironment, including tumor-associatedmacrophages (TAM), is an essential factor defining the efficiency ofchemotherapy. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of M2 macrophagemarkers, YKL-39 and CCL18, in tumors of breast cancer patients receivedanthracycline-based NAC.METHODS: Patients were divided into two groups according to the level ofdoxorubicin sensitivity marker TOP2a: DOX-Sense and DOX-Res groups. Expressionlevels of TOR2a, CD68, YKL-39 and CCL18 genes were analyzed by qPCR, theamplification of TOR2a gene locus was assessed by the microarray assay. Clinical and pathological responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were assessed.RESULTS: We found that the average level of TOP2a expression in patients ofDOX-Sense group was almost 10 times higher than in patients of DOX-Res group, andthe expression of CD68 was 3 times higher in the DOX-Sense group compared toDOX-Res group. We demonstrated that expression levels of M2-derived cytokines butnot the amount of TAM is indicative for clinical and pathological chemotherapyefficacy in breast cancer patients. Out of 8 patients from DOX-Sense group whodid not respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), 7 patients had M2+ macrophage phenotype (YKL-39+CCL18- or YKL-39-CCL18+) and only one patient had M2-macrophage phenotype (YKL-39-CCL18-). In DOX-Res group, out of 14 patients whoclinically responded to NAC 9 patients had M2- phenotype and only 5 patients had M2+ macrophage phenotype. Among pathological non-responders in DOX-Sense group,19 (82%) patients had M2+ tumor phenotype and only 4 (18%) patients had M2-phenotype. In DOX-Res group, all 5 patients who pathologically responded to NAChad M2 phenotype (YKL-39-CCL18-). Unlike the clinical response to NAC, thedifferences in the frequency of M2+ and M2- phenotypes between pathologicallyresponding and non-responding patients within DOX-Sense and DOX-Res groups werestatistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we showed that in patients with breast cancer who receivedanthracycline-containing NAC the absence of clinical response is associated with the presence of M2+ macrophage phenotype (YKL-39-CCL18 + or YKL-39 + CCL18-)based on TOP2a overexpression data.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3594-8 PMID: 29728799
