Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic core protein in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which catalyzes the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and mediatesgene silencing of the target genes that are involved in fundamental cellularprocesses, such as the cell fate decision, cell cycle regulation, senescence,cell differentiation, and cancer formation. A consistent association between TNBCmetastasis and EZH2 has not been confirmed. The aim of this study was toinvestigate the role of EZH2 in the regulation of tissue inhibitor ofmetalloproteinase (TIMPs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to promotemetastasis of TNBC cells and to characterize the metastasis-associated genesregulated by EZH2 in TNBC cells. We found that high levels of EZH2 expressioninduce repression of TIMP2 transcription, leading to increased activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and thus to increased invasive activity of TNBC cells.PMCID: PMC5883093PMID: 29636998
