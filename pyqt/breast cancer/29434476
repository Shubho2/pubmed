Proactive skin care is often recommended tominimise these skin reactions and maintain the integrity of the epidermalbarrier; nevertheless, no consensual guidelines are systematically used. Thismulticentre, observational, prospective study evaluated the tolerability andbenefit of supportive and barrier protective skin care products in preventingradiotherapy-induced skin reactions in 253 women initiating radiotherapy(exclusive or adjuvant) for breast cancer.Methods: Patients received a kit of 5 commercially available skin care productsbefore the first radiotherapy treatment. The following variables were assessed:cutaneous adverse events, investigator-assessed skin reactions (oedema, erythema,dryness, desquamation) before and after radiotherapy course, investigator, andpatient opinion on products benefit. Results were analysed by frequency ofproduct use (heavy versus low).Results: Average age was 60 years (range: 34-85). Over 92% of patients reportedgood to excellent tolerance on irradiated skin for each product. During the6-week radiotherapy period, we observed that heavy product users had less skinreactions than the low users, particularly within 10 days of radiotherapyinitiation (8% versus 18%; p = .031). Positive physician's opinion on product usewas more frequent for high (66.6%) versus low (32%) users. Patient-assessedpatient benefit index was generally >1, indicating relevant treatment benefit,with a tendency for better benefit in high versus low users.Conclusions: These results support recommendations to use skin care products tominimise the impact of secondary cutaneous reactions with radiotherapy cancertreatment.DOI: 10.1177/1178223417752772 PMCID: PMC5802618PMID: 29434476
