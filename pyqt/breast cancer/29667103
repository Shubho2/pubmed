Therefore, we assessed the joint association of modifiable riskfactors, using a healthy lifestyle index (HLI) score, with risk of specificreproductive cancers.METHOD: This study included a subcohort of 3,185 of the 39,618 women, whoparticipated in the Canadian Study of Diet, Lifestyle, and Health, and in whom410, 177, and 100 postmenopausal breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers,respectively, were ascertained. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95%confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional hazards regression modelsmodified for the case-cohort design.RESULTS: Each unit increase in the HLI score was associated with 3% and 5%reductions in risk of postmenopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer,respectively (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.94-0.99 and HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.90-0.99,respectively). Compared to those with HLI score in the lowest category, those in the highest category had 30% and 46% reductions in risk of these cancers,respectively. The HLI score was not associated with altered risk of ovariancancer.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that promoting a healthy lifestyle may aid inthe primary prevention of postmenopausalÂ breast and endometrial cancers.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1032-1 PMID: 29667103
