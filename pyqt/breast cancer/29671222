The purpose of this study was to analyze therole of Ki-67 among patients with TNBC, and determine the optimal Ki-67 cut-offpoint to demonstrate its prognostic relevance associated with patient age andtreatment strategy.METHODS/PATIENTS: 201 consecutive patients treated for primary TNBC from 1999 to 2014 were analyzed. Clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes werecompared between patients treated with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Weused time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve andtime-dependent area under the ROC curve (AUC) to evaluate the discriminativeability of Ki-67 at 3 and 5 years of follow-up. A Ki-67 cut-off point thatmaximized sensibility and specificity was established. Interaction effect betweenage and Ki-67 on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) wasevaluated by stratified analysis.RESULTS: According to the coordinates of the ROC curves, the best cut-off pointfor Ki-67 was 60% (high/low). In the whole group, there was not a statisticallysignificant association between Ki-67 and OS and DFS, using a cut-off point of60%. In multivariate analysis (COX proportional hazards regression), for DFS highKi-67 (> 60%) was a poor prognostic factor in patients > 40 years old and abetter prognostic factor among the patients < 40 years old.CONCLUSION: Prognostic value of Ki-67 in TNBC, using a cut-off point of 60%, may vary depending on age.DOI: 10.1007/s12094-018-1877-5 PMID: 29671222
