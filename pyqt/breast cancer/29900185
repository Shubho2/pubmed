This pilot study aimed to evaluate the detective capability and feasibility of a prototype of aportable breast cancer detector using a radar-based imaging system. Five patientswith histologically confirmed breast cancers with a minimum diameter of 1 cm wereenrolled in this study. The antenna array dome of the device was placed on thebreast of the patient in a supine position for 15 min per single examination. Theprimary endpoint was a detection rate of breast cancers. The secondary endpoints were positional accuracy and adverse event. All five targeted breast tumors were detected and were visualized at the sites confirmed by other diagnosticmodalities. Among five tumors, one was not detected via mammography because ofheterogeneously dense breast and another was a microinvasive carcinoma ofinvasive tumor size 0.5 mm. No study-related adverse events occurred. Theprototype of a portable breast cancer detector has sufficient detectivecapability, is safe for clinical use, and might detect an early stage breastcancer, such as noninvasive carcinoma. Future developments should focus onfurther decreasing the size of the machine and shortening inspection time.DOI: 10.1117/1.JMI.5.2.025502 PMCID: PMC5997971 [Available on 2019-06-13]PMID: 29900185
