Compression of important anatomy adjacent to the sella may producedisabling symptoms and endocrine derangement, leading to significant morbidity.METHODS: An ambispective review of patient records between 2013 and 2017 fromthree neurosurgical centres was performed. After identifying cases, furtherinvestigation was performed to evaluate patient demographic, symptoms atpresentation, radiological and histological findings, management, and outcome.RESULTS: Our investigation identified 12 patients with pituitary metastasis. The average age of the cases was 63.4 years, with breast (n = 4) and lung (n = 4)being the most common primary cancers. In half the cases there was a history ofmetastatic disease, while in one-quarter of cases, pituitary symptoms were thefirst sign of malignancy. Adenohypophyseal dysfunction (83%), diabetes insipidus (DI) (75%), headache (67%) and visual field defects (67%) were the most commonfindings at presentation. Glucocorticoid replacement increased the sensitivityfor diagnosis of DI. All cases were contrast enhancing on MRI and the endoscopic trans-sphenoidal approach was preferred for biopsy and debulking.CONCLUSIONS: The pituitary should not be overlooked as a site of metastasis andsellar symptoms may be the first presentation of neoplastic disease. Anybiochemical or clinical sign of pituitary pathology in a patient with knowncancer should raise suspicion for sellar metastasis. Moreover, the development ofDI or ophthalmoplegia from any pituitary lesion is suggestive of metastaticdisease even in patients with no known primary.DOI: 10.1007/s11102-018-0899-x PMID: 29974330
