Pure ER antagonists, which completely lack tissue-specific agonistactivity, hold promise for preventing and treating endocrine resistance, however an absence of structural information hinders the development of novel candidates.Here we synthesize a small panel of benzopyrans with variable side chains toidentify pure antiestrogens in a uterotrophic assay. We identify OP-1074 as apure antiestrogen and a selective ER degrader (PA-SERD) that is efficacious inshrinking tumors in a tamoxifen-resistant xenograft model. Biochemical andcrystal structure analyses reveal a structure activity relationship implicatingthe importance of a stereospecific methyl on the pyrrolidine side chain ofOP-1074, particularly on helix 12.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04413-3 PMCID: PMC6006285PMID: 29915250
