Epub2018 Jul 12.Iodine-125 labeled Australian frog tree host-defense peptides caerin 1.1 and 1.9 better inhibit human breast cancer cells growth than the unlabeled peptides.125I-caerin 1.9 may better be used for the treatment of breast cancer.Yuan J(1), You X, Ni G, Wang T, Cavezza S, Pan X, Liu X.Author information: (1)The First Affiliated Hospital/School of Clinical Medicine, GuangdongPharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China.xiaosongl@yahoo.com, panxuan@tom.com.OBJECTIVE: We recently showed that host defense caerin peptides isolated fromAustralian frog tree were able to inhibit cervical cancer tumour cell growth invitro. We wished to determine if radioactive isotope iodine-125 (125I) can belabeled to caerin 1.9 peptide and if this peptide is bioactive for breast cancer cells treatment.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The biological function of caerin (1.1 and 1.9) peptideswere investigated by in vitro 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The anti-cancer effect of 125I labeledcaerin 1.9 was compared with unlabeled caerin 1.9 peptide. The tissuedistribution of 125I labeled caerin 1.9 peptide was further studied in mice.RESULTS: In the current paper, we demonstrated that caerin peptides (1.1 and 1.9)were separately able to inhibit the viability of two breast cancer cell lines in vitro and this inhibition was more profound when these peptides weresimultaneously applied. Moreover, 125I can be stably attached to caerin 1.9peptide with high efficiency. Iodine-125 labeled caerin 1.9 inhibited breastcancer cells line MCF-7 viability more efficiently than free 125I and also thanunlabeled caerin 1.9. Additionally, iodine-125 labeled caerin 1.9 in vivo imagingdemonstrated that although slightly, it could be accumulated in tumor tissue.CONCLUSION: Our results from this totally original study indicated thatradioactive isotope 125I labeled to caerin peptide 1.9 may be used to treatbreast cancer while at the same time the response to treatment may be monitoredby simultaneous imaging.DOI: 10.1967/s002449910803 PMID: 30006645
