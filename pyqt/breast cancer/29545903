China.(2)Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, West China School ofPreclinical and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041,P.R. China.There is limited knowledge regarding the influence of autophagy on the anticancereffect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA). The present study aimed to investigate thisinfluence within human breast cancer cells. Changes in cell viability, cell cycledistribution, apoptosis and associated genes were analyzed in MDA-MB-231 cellssubjected to DHA following alteration in autophagy levels; the autophagy levelwas decreased following autophagy-related 7 (Atg7) knockdown or increased usingrapamycin. The data indicated that rapamycin had the ability to notably enhancethe anticancer effect of DHA on MDA-MB-231 cells. Autophagy induction may be key in mediating the anticancer effects of DHA, and rapamycin may regulate thedeath-associated protein kinase via the alteration of Atg7 expression, whichwould influence cell apoptosis. The present study presented a novel insight into enhancing the effectiveness of future treatment regimens for breast cancer using DHA.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8013 PMCID: PMC5840757PMID: 29545903
