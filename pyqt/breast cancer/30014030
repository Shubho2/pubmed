Based on standardized national classification, we categorized patients'socioeconomic status (SES) by occupational class (blue-collar, service,professional, manager), cross-classified by industry sector (blue-collar,service, white-collar). Using blue-collar workers in blue-collar industries asthe reference group, we estimated the odds ratio (OR) for each cancer incidenceusing conditional logistic regression with multiple imputation, adjusted formajor modifiable risk factors (smoking, alcohol consumption).Results: We identified lower risks among higher-SES women for common and overall cancers: e.g., ORs for managers in blue-collar industries were 0.67 (95%confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.98) for stomach cancer and 0.40 (95% CI,0.19-0.86) for lung cancer. Higher risks with higher SES were evident for breast cancer: the OR for professionals in service industries was 1.60 (95% CI,1.29-1.98). With some cancers, homemakers showed a similar trend to subjects withhigher SES; however, the magnitude of the OR was weaker than those with higherSES.Conclusions: Even after controlling for major modifiable risk factors,socioeconomic inequalities were evident for female cancer incidence in Japan.DOI: 10.1016/j.ssmph.2018.06.001 PMCID: PMC6019265PMID: 30014030
