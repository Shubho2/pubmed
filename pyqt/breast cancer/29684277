Prolactinreceptor (PRLR) is overexpressed in breast and prostate cancers and is a newtarget for cancer therapy. We evaluated REGN2878, an anti-PRLR monoclonalantibody, as an immunoPET reagent. REGN2878 was labeled with Zr-89 afterconjugation with desferrioxamine B or labeled with I-131/I-124. In vitrodetermination of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of parentalREGN2878, DFO-REGN2878, and iodinated REGN2878 was performed by examining theeffect of the increasing amounts of these on uptake of trace-labeled I-131REGN2878. REGN1932, a non-PRLR binding antibody, was used as a control. Imagingand biodistribution studies were performed in mice bearing tumor xenografts with various expression levels of PRLR, including MCF-7, transfected MCF-7/PRLR, PC3, and transfected PC3/PRLR and T4D7v11 cell lines. The specificity of uptake intumors was evaluated by comparing Zr-89 REGN2878 and REGN1932, and in vivocompetition compared Zr-89 REGN2878 uptake in tumor xenografts with and withoutprior injection of 2 mg of nonradioactive REGN2878. The competition binding assayof DFO-REGN2878 at ratios of 3.53-5.77 DFO per antibody showed IC50 values of0.4917 and 0.7136 nM, respectively, compared to 0.3455 nM for parental REGN2878and 0.3343 nM for I-124 REGN2878. Imaging and biodistribution studies showedexcellent targeting of Zr-89 REGN2878 in PRLR-positive xenografts at delayedtimes of 189 h (presented as mean ± 1 SD, percent injected activity per mL(%IA/mL) 74.6 ± 33.8%IA/mL). In contrast, MCF-7/PRLR tumor xenografts showed alow uptake (7.0 ± 2.3%IA/mL) of control Zr-89 REGN1932 and a very low uptake and rapid clearance of I-124 REGN2878 (1.4 ± 0.6%IA/mL). Zr-89 REGN2878 has excellentantigen-specific targeting in various PRLR tumor xenograft models. We estimated, using image-based kinetic modeling, that PRLR antigen has a very rapid in vivoturnover half-life of ∼14 min from the cell membrane. Despite relatively modestestimated tumor PRLR expression numbers, PRLR-expressing cells have shown finalretention of the Zr-89 REGN2878 antibody, with an uptake that appeared to berelated to PRLR expression. This reagent has the potential to be used in clinicaltrials targeting PRLR.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01133 PMID: 29684277
