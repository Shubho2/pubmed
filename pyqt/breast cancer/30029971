Electronic address: carlo.lavecchia@unimi.it.AIM: To characterise mortality trends from major non-communicable diseases in theEuropean Union (EU) analysing data from the World Health Organization (WHO)Mortality Database.METHODS: We obtained EU population and death certification data for majornon-communicable diseases, i.e. seven cancer sites (stomach, intestine, pancreas,lung, breast, prostate and haematopoietic), total cancers, coronary heartdiseases (CHDs) and cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) from the WHO MortalityDatabase over the 1970 and 2012 period. We computed age-standardised rates (worldstandard population) and applied joinpoint regression models to identify temporaltrends and age period cohort (APC) models to disentangle the effects of age,period of death and cohort of birth on mortality.RESULTS: In 2012, 2.4 million deaths were recorded in the EU (1.3 million fromcancers and 1.1 million from CHD and CVD combined). Over the last decade,mortality from cancer fell by 14% in men and 8% in women, resulting inage-standardised rates of 144 and 88/100,000 persons, respectively, in 2012. The only exceptions to the general downward trends were pancreatic cancer and female lung cancer. Both cardiovascular diseases mortality fell over 35% in both sexeswith rates of 60 and 28/100,000 for CHD, and of 30 and 23/100,000 for CVD, in menand women, respectively, in 2012.CONCLUSIONS: Overall trends in mortality rates from non-communicable diseases in the EU were favourable, and the joinpoint and APC models indicated these trendsare likely to continue in the near future. Lack of progress in tobacco-relatedmortality in women underlines the importance of female-specific anti-tobaccopolicies.Copyright © 2018.
