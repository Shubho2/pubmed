Patients were divided into 2 groups (PMRT and non-PMRT) forstatistical analysis.Results: The median follow-up time was 64 months (range 12-123 months). The 5year cumulative locoregional recurrence (LRR) and disease recurrence (DR) rateswere 26.5% and 49.6%, respectively. Despite their more adverse prognosticfeatures, patients with PMRT had lower 5 year cumulative LRR and DR rates thanthose without PMRT (LRR: 18.3% vs 52.2%, respectively, p=0.0005; DR: 45% vs69.1%, p=0.0334, respectively). On multivariate analysis of the entire studycohort, forgoing PMRT was significantly associated with developing LRR and DR.Subset analysis revealed that PMRT significantly reduced the 5 year LRR rate inpatients with pre-chemotherapy clinical stages IIA (8.3% vs 46.2%, p=0.019) andIIIA (16% vs 66.7%, p=0.003). PMRT also significantly reduced the 5 year DR rate in patients with pre-chemotherapy clinical stage IIA (24.5% vs 69.3%, p=0.0151)and â‰¥IIIB (70.8% vs 100%, p=0.0481).Conclusion: In our cohort of patients with TNBC treated with NAC and MRM, PMRTsignificantly improved locoregional control and disease-free survival in theentire cohort as well as in patients with stage IIA disease. Our results may helpin tailoring adjuvant treatment decisions for these particular patientpopulations.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S158482 PMCID: PMC5896676PMID: 29670372
