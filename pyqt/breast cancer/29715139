Thecorrelations between women's reproductive history, including the age at menarche and menopause, parity, oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use, the results of DXA, and BC risk were evaluated in univariate andmultivariate analyses.RESULTS: Overall, 168 (28.3%) women had osteoporosis and/or osteopenia (low BMD).Both bone alterations were protective factors for BC, especially when they wereconsidered together (p=0.001). Only the interval between menarche and menopause(MMI), dichotomized at 37.5 years as an optimal cut-off, and the HRT use reached a statistical significance (p<0.01) as risk factors. The three parameters wereindependent because they remained significant in the stepwise logistic regressionanalysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) obtained with the model was 0.694 (95%CI=0.694-0.731).CONCLUSION: This hypothesized predictive model is fairly accurate and couldidentify patients at increased risk of developing luminal-type BC in a populationof postmenopausal women who performed DXA, simply based on their history.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12561 PMID: 29715139  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
