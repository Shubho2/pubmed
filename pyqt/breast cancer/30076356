The majorchallenge is the number of patients who are incorrectly diagnosed. To addressthis, we developed an expert diagnostic system that can differentiate amongpatients with asthma, COPD or a normal lung function based on measurements oflung function and information about patient's symptoms. To develop accurateclassification algorithms, data from 3657 patients were used and thenindependently verified using data from 1650 patients collected over a period oftwo years. Our results demonstrate that the expert diagnostic system cancorrectly identify patients with asthma and COPD with sensitivity of 96.45% andspecificity of 98.71%. Additionally, 98.71% of the patients with a normal lungfunction were correctly classified, which contributed to a 49.23% decrease indemand for conducting additional tests, therefore decreasing financial cost.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-30116-2 PMCID: PMC6076307PMID: 30076356
