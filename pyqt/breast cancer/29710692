All the lesions were subject to conventional US and 2D SWE examinations. In 2D SWE, the qualitative parameter of stiff rim sign and quantitative parameter of maximal shear wave velocity (SWV)were obtained. The diagnosis performances of US and combination of US and 2D SWE were evaluated, including sensitivity, specificity and the area under thereceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The AUROC of US and the combinedmethod were also evaluated in subgroups with different diameters.RESULTS: Pathologically, 26 breast lesions were confirmed to be mastitis and 79were malignant. The cut-off value for maximal SWV was 6.75 m/sec. The AUROC ofstiff rim sign and maximal SWV were 0.701 (95% CI: 0.604-0.787) and 0.753 (95%CI: 0.659-0.832) respectively. Compared with US, the specificity and AUROC of thecombined method increased significantly (specificity: 23.0% vs. 96.1%, AUROC:0.520 vs. 0.762; both P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The combination of US and 2D SWE improved the diagnostic performancein the differential diagnosis between mastitis and breast malignancy incomparison with the conventional US alone.DOI: 10.3233/CH-180400 PMID: 29710692
