The idealrisk-predictive test should: integrate the effects of both genetic and nongeneticfactors and aim to capture these effects using an approach that is bothbiologically stable and technically reproducible; derive a score from easilyaccessible biological samples that acts as a surrogate for the organ in question;and enable the effectiveness of risk-reducing measures to be monitored.Substantial evidence has accumulated suggesting that the epigenome and, inparticular, DNA methylation-based tests meet all of these requirements. However, the development and implementation of DNA methylation-based risk-prediction testsposes considerable challenges. In particular, the cell type specificity of DNAmethylation and the extensive cellular heterogeneity of the easily accessiblesurrogate cells that might contain information relevant to less accessibletissues necessitates the use of novel methods in order to account for theseconfounding issues. Furthermore, the engagement of the scientific community with health-care professionals, policymakers and the public is required in order toidentify and address the organizational, ethical, legal, social and economicchallenges associated with the routine use of epigenetic testing.DOI: 10.1038/nrclinonc.2018.30 PMID: 29485132
