However, the roleof mitochondrial redox deregulation in metastasis remains unclear. In breastcancer, upregulation of mitochondrial antiapoptotic protein G1P3 (IFI6) wasassociated with poor distance metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Therefore, wetested the hypothesis that G1P3-induced mitochondrial redox deregulation confers metastatic potentials in breast cancer cells.METHODS: Cell migration and invasion assays; confocal and immunofluorescencemicroscopy; and Illumina HumanHT-12 BeadChip to assess gene expression.RESULTS: Consequent to its localisation on inner-mitochondrial membrane, mtROSwere higher in G1P3-expressing cells (MCF-7G1P3). G1P3-overexpressing cellsmigrated and invaded faster than the vector controls with increased number offilopodia and F-actin bundles (p ≤ 0.05). mtROS suppression with H2O2 scavengers and mitochondrial-specific antioxidants significantly decreased migratorystructures and reversed G1P3-induced migration and invasion (p ≤ 0.05). Knocking down G1P3 decreased both migration and migratory structures in MCF-7G1P3 cells.Moreover, gene networks involved in redox regulation, metastasis and actinremodelling were upregulated in MCF-7G1P3 cells.CONCLUSIONS: G1P3-induced mtROS have a direct role in migratory structureformation and nuclear gene expression to promote breast cancer cell metastasis.Therefore, interrupting mitochondrial functions of G1P3 may improve clinicaloutcomes in breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0137-3 PMID: 29899394
