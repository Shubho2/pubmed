The aim of this study was toexamine whether survivin knock-down could enhance paclitaxel-induced apoptosis inbreast cancer cells in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: MCF-7 cells were infected with an siRNA-expressingadenovirus vector against survivin (Adv-siSurv) or Renilla luciferase as acontrol (Adv-siRL). After treatment with paclitaxel, cells were analyzed byapoptotic, cell cycle and immunoblotting assays.RESULTS: Of cells treated with paclitaxel alone, only 20.2±2.08% showed apoptoticfeatures. An increase in the paclitaxel dose was associated with increasedsurvivin expression. In contrast, Adv-siSurv infection resulted in a markedincrease in apoptotic cell death in paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells (49.9±7.70%). The percentage of cells in the G2M phase was lower (23.9±1.64%) inAdv-siSurv-infected cells than that of Adv-siRL-treated cells (40.0±2.43%).Adv-siSurv infection reduced survivin, procaspase-9, and procaspase-3 levels inpaclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells.CONCLUSION: Loss of survivin expression enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro.Copyright© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12725 PMID: 29970562  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
