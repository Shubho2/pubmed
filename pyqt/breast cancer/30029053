We quantity thesepatterns, and the impact of two leading non-cancer causes of death, within tenyears of breast cancer diagnosis.METHODS: Population based cancer registry study of 23,809 women aged 50-79diagnosed with first primary breast cancer in Queensland, Australia, 1997 to 2012with additional data linkage to identify individual non-cancer mortality causes. Flexible parametric competing-risks models were used to estimate the crude andadjusted probabilities of death.RESULTS: While overall mortality increased with age at diagnosis, this effect wasstrongest for non-cancer (such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease)mortality. Women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer had a higher crudeprobability of breast cancer death (23.1% versus 4.5% for localised) but similar probability of competing mortality (11.6% versus 11.3%). Within each category of spread of disease, the probability of breast-cancer deaths remained relativelyconstant with age, while the probability of competing deaths increased. The10-year probability of dying from breast cancer was 3.7%, 4.2% and 5.6% amongwomen with localised disease aged 50 to 59, 60-69 and 70-79 respectively, but3.1%, 7.8% and 22.9% for competing mortality. Increasing age, advanced diseaseand being unpartnered were independently associated with increased risk of breastcancer and competing deaths.CONCLUSIONS: Promotion of improved health behaviors after a cancer diagnosis and development of individualized strategies for clinical management should beprioritized as part of optimal care for breast cancer survivors.Copyright Â© 2018.
