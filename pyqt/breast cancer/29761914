[Epub ahead of print]Molecular features in young vs elderly breast cancer patients and the impacts on survival disparities by age at diagnosis.Wang MX(1), Ren JT(1)(2), Tang LY(3), Ren ZF(1).Author information: (1)The School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.(2)Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.(3)The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.Young and elderly breast cancer patients are more likely to have a poorer outcomethan middle-aged patients. The intrinsic molecular features for this disparityare unclear. We obtained data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) on May 15, 2017to test the potential mediation effects of the molecular features on theassociation between age and prognosis with a four-step approach. The relativecontributions of the molecular features (PAM50 subtype, risk stratification, DNAmage, and mutations in TP53, PIK3CA, MLL3, CDH1, GATA3, and MAP3K1) to agedisparities in survival were estimated by Cox proportional hazard models with or without the features. Young patients were significantly more likely to havebasal-like subtype, GATA3 mutations, and younger DNA methylation (DNAm) age than middle-aged patients (P < .05). Both the young and elderly patients had asignificantly increased risk of breast cancer recurrence after adjusted by race, tumor size, and node status (Hazard ratio [HR] (95% confidence interval [CI]):2.81 [1.44, 5.45], 2.37 [1.45, 3.89], respectively). This increased risk wasweakened in the young patients after further adjustments in the molecularfeatures, particularly basal-like subtype, GATA3 mutations, and DNAm age (HR[95%CI]: 1.87 [0.81, 4.32]), resulting in 33.5% decreased risk of recurrence.Meanwhile, the adjustments of the molecular features did not alter the recurrencerisk for the elderly patients. Compared with middle-aged patients of breastcancer, poorer prognosis of elderly patients may be caused by aging, while poorerprognosis of young patients was probably mediated through intrinsiccharacteristics, such as basal-like subtype, GATA3 mutations, and DNAm age of thecancerous tissues.© 2018 The Authors.
