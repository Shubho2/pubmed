Electronic address: hoyuansn@tmu.edu.tw.The transcription factor GATA3 plays a significant role in mammary glanddevelopment and differentiation. We analyzed expression of GATA3 in breast cancer(BC) cell lines and clinical specimens from BC patients in Taiwan.Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR),quantitative real-time PCR carried out to determine the mRNA level of GATA3 from 241 pairs of matched tumor and adjacent normal tissues from anonymous femaledonors. GATA3 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and H-score were performed(n=25). Inducing and silencing of GATA3 were done by exposure MCF-7 cell line to nicotine or curcumin, respectively. GATA3 expression was detected in most of the estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumor specimens (176/241, 73%) compared withpaired normal tissues (65/241, 27%) (p= < 0.001). The GATA3 level was highest in Luminal A and independent t-tests revealed higher GATA3 were associated with ER+ (p = 0.018) and BC stages (stage II, and stage IV). Nuclear protein expression ofGATA3 was detected in tumor tissues (p=<0.001) with higher H-score in Luminal Apatients (p=0.012). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed that ER+/progesteronereceptor (PgR) + and lower grade BC patients with relatively high GATA3 hadbetter clinical overall survival (OS). GATA3 regulate ERa and BCL-2 as BC luminalsubtype markers. Cox univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that theexpression of GATA3 was an effective predictor of the risk of death. Wedemonstrated a correlation between GATA3 expression and only ER+ and suggest thata higher GATA3 expression is a good prognostic factor for OS for ER+/ BCpatients.Copyright Â© 2018.
