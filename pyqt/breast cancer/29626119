In this paper, FAP inhibitors weremodified and optimized for their use as theranostic tracers. Methods: FAPinhibitors (FAPIs) based on a quinoline structure were synthesized andcharacterized with respect to binding, internalization and efflux in cellsexpressing human and murine FAP as well as CD26. Preclinical pharmacokineticswere determined in tumor bearing animals with biodistribution experiments andsmall animal positron emission tomography (PET). Finally, a proof of conceptapproach of imaging and therapy was chosen in two patients with metastasizedbreast cancer. Results: Of 11 synthesized FAPIs FAPI-04 was identified as themost promising tracer for clinical application. Compared to the previouslypublished ligand FAPI-02, FAPI-04 showed an excellent stability in human serum, ahigher affinity for FAP as opposed to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and a slowerexcretion in vitro. In vivo, a higher SUV was reached in tumor-bearing animalsleading to higher area under curve values calculated from biodistributionexperiments. Finally, PET/CT scans with 68Ga-FAPI-04 in two patients withmetastasized breast cancer revealed high tracer uptake in metastases and areduction of pain symptoms after therapy with a considerable low dose of90Y-FAPI-04. Conclusion: FAPI-04 represents a promising tracer for bothdiagnostic imaging and possibly targeted therapy of malignant tumors with a high content of activated fibroblast such as breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.DOI: 10.2967/jnumed.118.210443 PMID: 29626119
