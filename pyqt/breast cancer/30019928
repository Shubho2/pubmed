Despite huge multilevel research, there are still several importantchallenges that have to be clarified in the management of this disease.Therefore, recent investigations have implemented a modern, multiomic approachwith the aim of identifying specific biomarkers for not only early detection but also to predict treatment responses and metastatic spread. Specific attention is paid to short miRNAs, which regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Aberrant miRNA expression could initiate cancer development, cellproliferation, invasion, migration, metastatic spread or drug resistance. AnmiRNA signature is, therefore, believed to be a promising biomarker andprediction tool that could be utilized in all phases of carcinogenesis. Thisarticle offers comprehensive information about miRNA profiles useful fordiagnostic and treatment purposes that may sufficiently advance breast cancermanagement and improve individual outcomes in the near future.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2018-0061 PMID: 30019928
