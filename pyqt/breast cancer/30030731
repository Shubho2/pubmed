Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) offers a treatmentalternative to traditional whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT) for selectpatients. This study aimed to analyze the use of IORT for patients undergoingbreast-conserving surgery at an academic institution located in a rural state.METHODS: A retrospective review analyzed all patients at a single institutionwith a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive breast cancerfrom April 2012 to January 2017 who were undergoing breast-conserving surgerywith either IORT or WBRT. Student's t test or Fisher's exact test was used tomake statistical comparisons.RESULTS: Patients undergoing IORT (n = 117) were significantly older thanpatients treated with WBRT (n = 191) (65.6 vs 58.6 years; p < 0.001) and hadsmaller tumors on both preoperative imaging (1.04 vs 1.66 cm; p < 0.05) and finalpathology (0.99 vs 1.48 cm; p < 0.05). Patients receiving IORT lived farther fromthe treating facility than patients treated with WBRT (67.2 vs 30.8 miles;p < 0.05). To account for biases created in the IORT selection criteria, subgroupanalysis was performed for women receiving WBRT who fulfilled IORT selectioncriteria, and distance traveled remained significant (67.2 vs 31.4 miles;p < 0.05). Neither recurrence nor survival differed between the IORT and WBRTgroups. Medicare reimbursement for IORT was approximately 50% more than for WBRT.CONCLUSIONS: For women from rural communities, IORT appears to be an attractiveoption because these women tend to be older and to live farther from thetreatment facility.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6574-7 PMID: 30030731
