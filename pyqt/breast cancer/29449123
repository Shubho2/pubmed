Demographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics were assessed for each year during this interval.To evaluate the association between Medicaid expansion and these parameters,these variables, along with quality metrics deriving from said variables, werecompared for the years 2011 to 2013 (pre) and the years 2014 to 2016 (post).RESULTS: Of 13,625 women with breast cancer, 11,915 (59.5%) were diagnosed andtreated from 2011 to 2013, and 8,127 (40.5%) were diagnosed and treated from 2014to 2016. After Medicaid expansion, fewer patients were uninsured (3.7% post vs1.0% pre) and more were covered by Medicaid (15.9% post vs 10.9% pre) (p <0.001). There was increased diagnosis of early stage (I and II) breast cancer(p = 0.002) and an increasing proportion of women undergoing breast-conservation therapy (p < 0.001). Time from diagnosis to operation increased (p < 0.001), timefrom operation to chemotherapy remained unchanged (p = 0.26) and time fromoperation to radiation decreased (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The expansion of Kentucky Medicaid in 2014 has been associated with earlier diagnosis and somewhat improved quality of breast cancer care, despite a stable disease incidence. Additional improvements in treatment expediency willrequire improvements in patient outreach and healthcare infrastructure.Copyright © 2018 American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.
