Aberrant expression of genes in mTOR pathway and their targeting miRNAsplays an important role in TNBC. The aim of this study was to determine theexpression of mTOR and S6K1 and their targeting miRNAs in breast cancer celllines and clinical samples. miRNAs targeting 3'-UTR of mTOR and S6K1 mRNAs werepredicted using bioinformatic algorithms. MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and MCF-10A as well as 20 TNBC samples were analyzed for gene and miRNA expression using quantitativereal-time PCR (RT-qPCR). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysiswas performed for evaluation of candidate miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers. miR-96and miR-557 targeting mTOR and S6K1 mRNAs, respectively, were selected, andmiR-3182 was selected as the miRNA targeting both genes. The miRNAs weredown-regulated in cell lines, while their target mRNAs were up-regulated. Similarfindings were observed in clinical samples. The ROC curve analysis revealeddecline in expression of these miRNAs. We suggest that miR-96, miR-557, andmiR-3182 can be used as inhibitory agents for mTOR and S6K1 in TNBC-targetedtherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s12010-018-2773-8 PMID: 29862445
