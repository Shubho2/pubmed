Sequences similar to Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) were detected in human breast cancer in several studies fromdifferent geographical areas. However, the role played by this virus in breastcancer tumorigenesis is not completely understood. These MMTV-like sequences werefound to be associated with breast cancer of more malignant types. The aim ofthis study is to determine the prevalence of MMTV-like envelope gene (env)positivity in breast cancer and non-cancerous breast tissue from Saudi Arabia.METHODS: Detection of MMTV-like env proviral sequences was done using newlydesigned primers for conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One hundrednighty four samples were collected from 103 females with breast cancer inaddition to 51 control breast tissue obtained from individuals without cancer. Weadditionally investigated the association of proviral positivity with age of the patients, grade of breast cancer and presence of lymph node metastasis. Theresults were confirmed by sequencing.RESULTS: The prevalence of MMTV-like env proviral positivity was 8.7% (9/103).MMTV env proviral sequences were detected in 5.9% (6/101) of breast cancertissues and 9.7% (9/93) of non-cancerous adjacent tissues obtained from the same patients. None of the 51 control sample showed positive result for the MMTV envgene. No significant association was found between detection of the virus and theage of the patient, grade of the cancer or presence of metastasis.CONCLUSION: We document the presence of low frequency of MMTV env provirussequence among breast cancer patients from Saudi Arabia. Further studies areneeded to explore the role of the MMTV in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4074-6 PMCID: PMC5810194PMID: 29426297
