The compounds weresynthesized and fully characterized, mainly by means of elemental analysis, one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, FT-IR, and UV/Vis spectrophotometry. Thecrystal structures of three compounds were also solved by X-ray diffraction. Invitro cytotoxicity studies using a panel of human tumor cell lines (A549[non-small-cell lung carcinoma], MCF-7 [breast cancer], A2780 [ovariancarcinoma], H1975 [non-small-cell lung carcinoma], H460 [large-cell lungcarcinoma], and A431 [human epidermoid carcinoma]) showed the dtc-Pro-Aib-OtBuderivative to be very effective, with GI50 values much lower than those ofcisplatin. This complex was thus selected for evaluating stability underphysiological conditions and possible interactions with serum albumin, as well inPARP-1 enzyme inhibition assays and preliminary ex vivo toxicity experiments onhealthy rat tissues.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
