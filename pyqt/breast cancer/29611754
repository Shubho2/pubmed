These tumors exhibit diversebiological behavior and have a poor prognosis; chemotherapy is the mainstay oftreatment. The first case involves a young woman with cerebral and cerebellarmetastases who achieved a persistent objective response to fourth-line eribulin. In the second case, a woman who became metastatic during adjuvant therapy withanthracyclines and taxanes, and was refractory to capecitabine + bevacizumab,achieved a partial response and local symptom improvement witheribulin + bevacizumab. Last, a poly-treated patient demonstrated reasonableresponse and longer progression-free interval on third-line eribulin relative to previous lines of chemotherapy which is unusual in this clinical setting.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-0356 PMID: 29611754
