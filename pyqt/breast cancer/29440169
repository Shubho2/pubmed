Previous studies showed that PKM2 promoted tumor growth inxenograft models; however, depletion of PKM2 in the Brca1-loss-driven mammarytumor mouse model accelerates tumor formation. Because oncogenic kinases arefrequently activated in tumors and PKM2 phosphorylation promotes tumor growth, wehypothesized that phosphorylation of PKM2 by activated kinases in tumor cellsconfers PKM2 oncogenic function, whereas nonphosphorylated PKM2 is nononcogenic. Indeed, PKM2 was phosphorylated at tyrosine 105 (Y105) and formed oncogenicdimers in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, whereas PKM2 was largelyunphosphorylated and formed nontumorigenic tetramers in nontransformed MCF10Acells. PKM2 knockdown did not affect MCF10A cell growth but significantlydecreased proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with tyrosine kinaseactivation. Multiple kinases that are frequently activated in different cancertypes were identified to phosphorylate PKM2-Y105 in our tyrosine kinasescreening. Introduction of the PKM2-Y105D phosphomimetic mutant into MCF10A cellsinduced colony formation and the CD44hi/CD24neg cancer stem-like cell population by increasing Yes-associated protein (YAP) nuclear localization. ErbB2, a strong inducer of PKM2-Y105 phosphorylation, boosted nuclear localization of YAP andenhanced the cancer stem-like cell population. Treatment with the ErbB2 kinaseinhibitor lapatinib decreased PKM2-Y105 phosphorylation and cancer stem-likecells, impeding PKM2 tumor-promoting function. Taken together, phosphorylation ofPKM2-Y105 by activated kinases exerts oncogenic functions in part via activation of YAP downstream signaling to increase cancer stem-like cellproperties.Significance: These findings reveal PKM2 promotes tumorigenesis byinducing cancer stem-like cell properties and clarify the paradox of PKM2'sdichotomous functions in tumor progression.
