Epub 2018Apr 16.Glutamine-utilizing transaminases are a metabolic vulnerability ofTAZ/YAP-activated cancer cells.Yang CS(1), Stampouloglou E(1), Kingston NM(1), Zhang L(2), Monti S(2), VarelasX(3).Author information: (1)Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.(2)Section of Computational Biomedicine, Department of Medicine, BostonUniversity School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.(3)Department of Biochemistry, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA xvarelas@bu.edu.The transcriptional regulators TAZ and YAP (TAZ/YAP) have emerged aspro-tumorigenic factors that drive many oncogenic traits, including induction of cell growth, resistance to cell death, and activation of processes that promotemigration and invasion. Here, we report that TAZ/YAP reprogram cellularenergetics to promote the dependence of breast cancer cell growth on exogenousglutamine. Rescue experiments with glutamine-derived metabolites suggest anessential role for glutamate and α-ketoglutarate (AKG) in TAZ/YAP-driven cellgrowth in the absence of glutamine. Analysis of enzymes that mediate theconversion of glutamate to AKG shows that TAZ/YAP induce glutamic-oxaloacetictransaminase (GOT1) and phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1) expression andthat TAZ/YAP activity positively correlates with transaminase expression inbreast cancer patients. Notably, we find that the transaminase inhibitoraminooxyacetate (AOA) represses cell growth in a TAZ/YAP-dependent manner,identifying transamination as a potential vulnerable metabolic requirement forTAZ/YAP-driven breast cancer.© 2018 The Authors.DOI: 10.15252/embr.201643577 PMCID: PMC5989844 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 29661856
