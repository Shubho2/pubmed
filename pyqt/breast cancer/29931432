The near-infraredfluorescence dye indocyanine green (ICG) is widely used in optical imaging forthe dynamic detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in real time improving thedetection rate and accuracy. ICG has the advantages of low scattering in tissueabsorbance, low auto-fluorescence, and high signal-to-background ratio. Thedetection rate of axillary sentinel lymph nodes biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancerswith ICG was more than 95 %, the false-negative rate was lower than 10 %, and theaverage detected number ranged from 1.75 to 3.8. The combined use of ICG withnuclein or blue dye resulted in a lower false-negative rate. ICG is also beingused for the sentinel node detection in other malignant cancers such as head and neck, gastrointestinal, and gynecological carcinomas. In this article, we providean overview of numerous studies that used the near-infrared fluorescence imaging to detect the sentinel lymph nodes in breast carcinoma and other malignantcancers. It is expected that with improvements in the optical imaging systemstogether with the use of a combination of multiple dyes and verification in largeclinical trials, optical molecular imaging will become an essential tool for SLN detection and image-guided precise resection.DOI: 10.1007/s11307-018-1237-4 PMID: 29931432
