Electronic address:sanmartin@unav.es.Twenty-seven novel benzo[c][1,2,5]selenadiazole-5-carboxylic acid (BSCA)derivatives were designed and synthesized. Anti-proliferative activity of thesestructures was tested in vitro against a panel of five human cancer cell lines,including prostate (PC-3), colon (HT-29), leukemia (CCRF-CEM), lung (HTB-54) and breast (MCF-7). Four compounds (5, 6, 7 and 19) showed potent inhibitory activitywith GI50 values below 10 μM in at least one of the cancer cell lines. Theselectivity of these compounds was further examined in two non-malignant celllines derived from breast (184B5) and lung (BEAS-2B). Compound 7 exhibitedpromising anti-proliferative activity (GI50 = 3.7 μM) in MCF-7 cells, togetherwith high selectivity index (SI > 27.1). The induction of cell death by compound 7 was independent of the apoptotic process and it did not affect cell cycleprogression either. Likewise, radical scavenging properties of the newselenadiazole derivatives were confirmed by testing their ability to scavengeDPPH radicals. Four compounds (1, 2, 8 and 9) showed potent radical scavengingactivity, compound 9 being the most effective. Overall, while compound 7 wasidentified as the most cell growth inhibitory agent and selectively toxic tocancer cells, compound 9 proved to be the most potent antioxidant among theselenadiazole derivatives synthesized. This series of compounds can serve as anexcellent scaffold to achieve new and potent antioxidant compounds useful forseveral diseases, i.e. cancer, neurodegenerative, heart diseases andleishmaniasis, considering the high radical scavenging activity and low toxicity showed by most of the compounds.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
