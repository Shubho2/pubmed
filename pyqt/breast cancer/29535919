Selection ofhighly discriminative features decreases the computational cost and complexity ofthe classifier and improves its reliability for prediction of a new class ofsamples.Methods: The present study used hybrid particle swarm optimization and geneticalgorithms for gene selection and a fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) as theclassifier. Fuzzy logic is used to infer the importance of each sample in thetraining phase and decrease the outlier sensitivity of the system to increase theability to generalize the classifier. A decision-tree algorithm was applied tothe most frequent genes to develop a set of rules for each type of cancer. Thisimproved the abilities of the algorithm by finding the best parameters for theclassifier during the training phase without the need for trial-and-error by the user. The proposed approach was tested on four benchmark gene expressionprofiles.Results: Good results have been demonstrated for the proposed algorithm. Theclassification accuracy for leukemia data is 100%, for colon cancer is 96.67% andfor breast cancer is 98%. The results show that the best kernel used in training the SVM classifier is the radial basis function.Conclusions: The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm candecrease the dimensionality of the dataset, determine the most informative genesubset, and improve classification accuracy using the optimal parameters of theclassifier with no user interface.PMCID: PMC5840891PMID: 29535919
