A medianof 8 (range: 4-24) catheters were implanted into the tumor bed intraoperatively. A total dose of 22 Gy in 5 fractions of 4.4 Gy was delivered to the tumor bedwith a margin of 1-2 cm, on 3 consecutive days. The adjuvant systemic treatments consisted of hormonal therapy for 24 patients (73%) and chemotherapy for 6patients (18%). The survival results were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.Late side effects and cosmetic results were also registered.RESULTS: The median follow-up time following the second breast conserving therapywas 61 months (range: 26-189 months). During the follow-up, 4 patients (12.1%)developed second local recurrence. The five-year actuarial rates of the secondlocal, regional and distant recurrence were 6.3%, 6.1%, and 14.9%, respectively. The five-year probabilities of disease-free, cancer-specific and overall survivalwere 76.2%, 92.4%, and 89.2%, respectively. Four (12%), 19 (58%), 4 (12%) and 6(18%) patients had excellent, good, fair and poor cosmetic results, respectively.Grade 2 and 3 fibrosis developed in 9 (27%) and 1 (3%) patients. Asymptomatic fatnecrosis was detected in 7 (21%) women.CONCLUSION: Second breast conserving therapy with perioperative high-dose-rateinterstitial brachytherapy is a safe and feasible option for the management ofipsilateral breast tumor recurrences. Interstitial brachytherapy may decrease therisk of second local relapse with acceptable cosmetic results and low rate oflate side effects. Hence, in selected cases it can provide a feasible alternativeto salvage mastectomy. Orv Hetil. 2018; 159(11): 430-438.DOI: 10.1556/650.2018.30984 PMID: 29526128  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
