In this study, we aimed toobserve the anisotropy of SWE of breast lesions, and its correlation withclinical and histopathological findings.METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by institutional review board.From June 2014 to June 2015, a total of 276 women (mean age, 48.75 ± 12.12 years)with 276 breast lesions (174 malignant, 102 benign) were enrolled forconventional ultrasound and SWE before surgical excision. Elasticity modulus inthe longest diameter and orthogonal diameter were recorded, including maximumelasticity (Emax), mean elasticity (Emean), standard deviation (Esd) and ratiobetween mean elasticity of lesion and normal fatty tissue (Eratio). Anisotropycoefficients including anisotropic difference (AD) and anisotropy factors (AF)were calculated, and correlations with malignancy, tumor size, palpability,movability, lesion location and histopathology were analyzed.RESULTS: The average Emax, Emean, Esd and Eratio of the longest diameter weresignificantly higher than orthogonal diameter (P < 0.05). AUCs of ADs and AFswere inferior to quantitative parameters (P < 0.001), with AUCs of AFs superiorto ADs (P < 0.001). ADs showed no significant correlation with malignancy,palpability, movability, distance from nipple and skin, and histopathologicalpatterns. ADmean was significantly higher in inner half than outer half of thebreast (P = 0.034). Higher AFs were significantly correlated with larger lesionsize (P = 0.042), palpability (P < 0.05), shorter distance from nipple and skin(P < 0.05) and higher suspicion for malignancy (P < 0.001). AFs weresignificantly higher in IDC than DCIS (P < 0.05), higher in Grade II/III thanGrade I IDC (P < 0.001), and correlated with ER/PR(+) (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: AF of SWE was an indicator for malignancy and more aggressive breastcancer.DOI: 10.1186/s40644-018-0144-x PMCID: PMC5887177PMID: 29622044  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
