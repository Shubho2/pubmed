Epub 2018 Jun 26.Just How Attractive is the ATTRACT Trial?O'Sullivan GJ(1), de Graaf R(2), Black SA(3).Author information: (1)Galway University Hospitals, Galway, Ireland. gerard.osullivan2@hse.ie.(2)Radiology and Interventional Radiology, Clinical Center of Friedrichshafen,Friedrichshafen, Germany.(3)Venous and Lymphatic Surgery, Guys and St. Thomas Hospital, Westminster BridgeRoad, London, UK.Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major public health issue; deep vein thrombosis(DVT) affects about 1/1000 patients. Each year, VTE kills more patients inWestern Europe than breast cancer, prostate cancer, acquired immune deficiencysyndrome (AIDS) and road traffic accidents combined and is responsible for thedeaths of approximately 370,000 European citizens (Cohen et al. in Thromb Haemost98:756-764, 2007; Bĕlohlávek et al. in Exp Clin Cardiol 18(2):129-138, 2013). Therecently published ATTRACT trial (Acute Venous Thrombosis Thrombus Removal withAdjunctive Catheter-directed Thrombolysis) (Vedantham et al. in N Engl J Med377:2240-2252, 2017) concluded that the addition of catheter-directedthrombolysis to standard therapy with anticoagulation and compression stockingsoffers no significant clinical benefit over standard therapy in terms ofreduction in the rate of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) at 2 years. It is thelargest, prospective, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) andrepresents the culmination over a decade of planning, execution and analysis. In this opinion article, we analyse why it was needed, what it demonstrated, somelimitations, and the directions in which this important publication will take us.DOI: 10.1007/s00270-018-2016-y PMID: 29946944
