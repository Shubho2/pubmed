However, to date, thefunction and overall clinical significance of the vast majority of lncRNAs inbreast cancer remain largely unexplored. Here, we focused on LINC00310 byinterrogating the breast invasive carcinoma data set of the Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA). The results showed that LINC00310 was increased as breast cancerprogressed, and the deregulation of LINC00310 was significantly associated withpatients' survival. Experiments with knockout (KO) approach by CRISPR/Cas9 systemand the subsequent rescue experiments revealed that LINC00310 promoted cellproliferation by regulating c-Myc expression in vitro. Nude mouse xenograft assaydemonstrated that LINC00310 KO significantly suppressed tumour growth in vivo.Furthermore, we found that serum LINC00310 expression was significantlyup-regulated in patients with breast cancer, and receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that LINC00310 had a powerfulcapability of distinguishing patients with breast cancer from healthy individuals(the area under curve 0.828). Taken together, these results provide a moreintuitive approach to explore the clinical relevance and functional roles oflncRNAs. As a result, lncRNAs, such as LINC00310, may be used in clinicalapplications as circulating markers for breast cancer.© 2018 The Authors.
