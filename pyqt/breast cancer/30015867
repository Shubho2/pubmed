China.The long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA), urothelial carcinoma‑associated 1 (UCA1), hasbeen demonstrated to be dysregulated and serves a role in the progression ofseveral cancer types. However, the exact effects and underlying molecularmechanisms of UCA1 in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the detailed function and the mechanism ofUCA1 in the regulation of ATC cell progression. The present study identified thatthe expression levels of UCA1, in ATC cell lines and tissues, were significantly upregulated compared with normal human thyroid cell line and adjacentnon‑cancerous tissues, respectively. UCA1 knockdown significantly inhibited ATCcell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion and the expression level ofc‑myc proto‑oncogene (c‑myc) in vitro, and suppressed ATC tumor growth in vivo.In addition, using luciferase assays, it was confirmed that miR‑135a directlybound to UCA1 and the 3' untranslated region of c‑myc, and UCA1 competed withc‑myc for miR‑135a binding. miR‑135a inhibition may upregulate c‑myc expression, however, the upregulation of c‑myc may be partially reduced by short hairpinUCA1. The present results illustrated that UCA1 promoted ATC cell proliferationthrough acting as a competing endogenous RNA by binding miR‑135a. In conclusion, in the present study, UCA1 served as an oncogenic long non‑coding RNA promotingATC cell proliferation and may be a potential target for human ATC treatment.DOI: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9276 PMID: 30015867
