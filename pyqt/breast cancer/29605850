Due tothe moderately large data sizes, retrieving and analyzing them requires basicprogramming skills. Simple data browsing (e.g., candidate gene search) ishampered by the scarcity of easy-to-use data browsers addressed to the broadcommunity of biomedical researchers. We propose a new visualization methoddepicting the overall DNA methylation status at each TCGA cohort whileemphasizing its heterogeneity, thus facilitating the evaluation of the cohortvariability and the normal versus tumor differences. Implemented as a trackhubintegrated to the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser, itcan be easily added to any genome-wide annotation layer.To exemplify the trackhubusage we evaluate local DNA methylation boundaries, the aberrant DNA methylation of a CpG island located at the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) in breast and coloncancer, and the hypermethylation of the Homeobox HOXA gene cluster and the EN1gene in multiple cancer types.
