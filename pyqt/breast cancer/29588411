We report that p85S6K1, the longest isoform of S6K (ribosomal protein S6kinase), but not the shorter isoform p70S6K1 or p56S6K2, was secreted from cancercells through its HIV TAT-like, N-terminal six-arginine motif. The exogenouslyproduced p85S6K1 protein entered cultured transformed and nontransformed cells topromote or confer malignant behaviors, leading to increased cell growth andmigration. When injected into mice, the p85S6K1 protein enhanced the growth ofxenografted breast cancer cells and lung metastasis. Hence, our findings reveal arole for p85S6K1 as a secreted oncogenic kinase and provide a mechanism by which cancer cells remodel their microenvironment by transforming the surrounding cellsto drive tumorigenesis.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science.
