Colorectal cancer (CRC) that develops in patients with IBD is known ascolitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), but the underlying carcinogenicmechanism remains unclear. Genomic analysis of sporadic CRC has been welldescribed based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Using NGS, we compared all exons of 415 cancer-associated genes in patients in Japan and the USA who hadCRC and found similar genomic alteration patterns among the two populations.However, genomic analysis of CAC has not been thoroughly investigated.MAIN BODY: The molecular pathogenesis of CAC shares many features with sporadicCRC, but there are distinct variations in the time and frequency of somealterations. Gene alterations in CAC are gradually being elucidated using genomicsequencing analyses. Some studies have shown that gene alteration patterns differbetween UC and CD. The carcinogenesis of CAC depends on unique environmental,genetic, and immunological factors.CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we have discussed the differences in genomicalterations between sporadic CRC and CAC. NGS in patients with IBD has thepotential to detect early CAC and to suggest therapeutic targets.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1428-0 PMCID: PMC6027567PMID: 29966533
