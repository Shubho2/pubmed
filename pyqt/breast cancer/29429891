An effective oral drug therapy that replaces surgery might makeits treatment safer, cheaper, simpler and therefore more widely accessible. Theonly current medical treatment offered to women is intramuscular methotrexate,but this only reliably resolves smaller ectopic pregnancies. As such, manyectopic pregnancies require surgical excision. We show that vinorelbine, anorally available chemotherapeutic agent, potently induced placental cell deathbut did not harm fertility in mice. Vinorelbine was 100-1000 times more potentthan methotrexate in inducing placental cell death in vitro, and more potent thancombination methotrexate and gefitinib (another proposed treatment for ectopicpregnancy being evaluated in phase III trials). Mechanistically, it causedmicrotubule condensation, blocked mitosis and activated the apoptosis cascade in placental cells. Vinorelbine was more efficacious than methotrexate±gefitinib in reducing the volume of placental cell tumors xenografted subcutaneously in SCIDmice. Mice exposed to vinorelbine and allowed to breed, following a four weekwashout period, displayed normal fertility, however long-term fertility was notassessed. Human Fallopian tubes treated with vinorelbine did not exhibitup-regulation of apoptosis molecules. Our findings show that placental cellsappear sensitive to vinorelbine and it has potential as a tablet-only approach totreat ectopic pregnancy.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
