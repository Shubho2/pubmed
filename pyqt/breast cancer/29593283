One mechanism is tumor-induced myelopoiesis, whereby the expansion of immunosuppressive myeloidcells can impair tumor immunity. As myeloid cells and conventional dendriticcells (cDCs) are derived from the same progenitors, we postulated thatmyelopoiesis might impact cDC development. The cDC subset, cDC1, which includeshuman CD141+ DCs and mouse CD103+ DCs, supports anti-tumor immunity bystimulating CD8+ T-cell responses. Here, to understand how cDC1 developmentchanges during tumor progression, we investigated cDC bone marrow progenitors. Wefound localized breast and pancreatic cancers induce systemic decreases in cDC1s and their progenitors. Mechanistically, tumor-produced granulocyte-stimulatingfactor downregulates interferon regulatory factor-8 in cDC progenitors, and thus results in reduced cDC1 development. Tumor-induced reductions in cDC1 developmentimpair anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell responses and correlate with poor patient outcomes.These data suggest immune surveillance can be impaired by tumor-inducedalterations in cDC development.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03600-6 PMCID: PMC5871846PMID: 29593283
