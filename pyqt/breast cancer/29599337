The serum levels of MMP8 wasreported to be higher in patients with breast cancer than in healthy individuals.In this study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of a polymorphism in the promoter region of MMP8 (-799C/T) and two nonsynonymous polymorphisms (Val436Ala and Lys460Thr) to breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: MMP8 -799C/T, Val436Ala and Lys460Thr polymorphicgenotypes were determined for 1,232 patients with breast cancer and 1,232 healthycontrols by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphismmethodology.RESULTS: The odds ratios (ORs) after adjusting for age, gender, smoking andalcohol drinking status for those carrying CT and TT genotypes at the MMP8promoter C-799T were 1.03 (95% CI=0.88-1.23, p=0.7475) and 1.08 (95%CI=0.91-1.53, p=0.3561), respectively, compared to those carrying the wild-typeCC genotype. The OR for the combined T-bearing genotypes were of a similarnon-significant level (OR=1.05, 95% CI=0.90-1.26, p=0.5176). Supporting thisfinding, the adjusted OR for those carrying the T allele at MMP8 C-799T was 1.05 (95% CI=0.86-1.21, p=0.3797), compared to those carrying the wild-type C allele. There was also no significant association of MMP8 Lys460Thr with breast cancer.There was no polymorphic genotype at MMP8 Val436Ala found among any of theinvestigated individuals.CONCLUSION: MMP8 -799C/T, Val436Ala and Lys460Thr polymorphisms may only play an indirect role in determining personal cancer susceptibility to breast cancer inTaiwan.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12459 PMID: 29599337  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
