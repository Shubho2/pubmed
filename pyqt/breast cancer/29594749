Box 11365-3486, Tehran, Iran.Nucleolin is a multifunctional protein that is markedly overexpressed on thesurface of most cancer cells. By taking advantage of the high affinity andspecificity of the AS1411 aptamer for nucleolin, a signalling probe displacement electrochemical aptasensor was developed. The thiolated AS1411 aptamer wasconjugated to hydroxyapatite nanorods (HApNRs) decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). To further increase the electrical conductivity of the interface, theionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium alanine with its high ion conductivitywas placed on the electrode surface. Then, the aptamer was immobilized on themodified electrode and conjugated to signalling c-DNA tagged with AgNPs(c-DNA@AgNPs). In the presence of the MCF7 target cells, the signalling probe is displaced and released from the electrode surface. This leads to a decrease inthe current that is proportional to the concentration of cancer cells in therange from 10 to 106 cells mL-1, with a detection limit as low as 8 ± 2 cellsmL-1 (n = 3) (based as 3σ/m, where σ is the standard deviation of the blank and mis the slope of the calibration plot). This method presents a promising tool for highly sensitive and selective detection of surface nucleolin on MCF7 cancercells.
