It calculatedindices of perceived risk and seriousness of the cancers and perceivedeffectiveness, benefits and difficulties of the screening; and performeddescriptive and multivariate regression analysis of the demands and the HBMconstructs.RESULTS: Less than 23.7% of respondents (N = 805) had ever undertaken BCS/CCS but62.7% reported willingness to receive the service. Demands for BCS/CCSillustrated negative associations (Beta = -0.11 and -0.10) with age but positive (Beta = 0.15 and 0.11) links with education. The absolute values of standardized regression coefficients between the demand and the HBM constructs added up to0.69 for BCS and 0.64 for CCS respectively, being 4-40 times that of age andeducation.CONCLUSIONS: Models incorporating all HBM constructs have substantially greaterpower than commonly researched single factors in explaining BCS/CCS demands.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Comprehensive BCS/CCS promotion addressing all HBMconstructs in a synergetic way may prove to be more effective.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
