We investigated the expression of VEGFR2 in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) andanalyzed the clinical response to the VEGFR inhibitor lenvatinib.METHODS: This cross-sectional study included primary tumor samples obtained from 12 patients with ATC, including 5 males and 7 females (age range 63-89Â years) whounderwent surgery or core needle biopsy for a thyroid tumor in the Department of Breast and Endocrine Surgery at Kanagawa Cancer Center in Kanagawa, Japan. VEGFR2protein expression in the ATC samples was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in allpatients, and the therapeutic effect of lenvatinib was evaluated in sevenpatients who underwent tissue biopsy and lesion evaluation.RESULTS: VEGFR expression was not detected in any of the samples from the 12patients. Four of the 12 patients treated with lenvatinib had partial response,the three patients achieved stable disease, and the five patients were notexamined.CONCLUSIONS: There was no correlation between the expression of VEGFR2 in tumortissue and the clinical response to lenvatinib among patients with ATC. Furtherstudies are necessary to elucidate the mechanism underlying the response tolenvatinib.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3657-x PMID: 30051190
