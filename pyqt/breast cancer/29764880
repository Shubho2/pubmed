Observational studies suggest that the combination of two-dimensional (2D) digital mammography and DBT increases diagnosticaccuracy. However, because of duplicate exposure, this comes at the cost of anaugmented radiation dose. This undesired adverse impact can be avoided by usingsynthesised 2D images reconstructed from the DBT data (s2D).We designed adiagnostic superiority trial on a high level of evidence with the aim ofproviding a comparison of screening efficacy parameters resulting from DBT+s2Dversus the current screening standard 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) ina multicentre and multivendor setting on the basis of the quality-controlled,population-based, biennial mammography screening programme in Germany.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 80 000 women in the eligible age 50-69 years attending the routine mammography screening programme and willing to participate in the TOSYMA trial will be assigned by 1:1 randomisation to either the intervention arm(DBT+s2D) or the control arm (FFDM) during a 12-month recruitment period inscreening units of North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony. State cancerregistries will provide the follow-up of interval cancers.Primary endpoints arethe detection rate of invasive breast cancers at screening examination and thecumulative incidence of interval cancers in the 2 years after a negativeexamination. Secondary endpoints are the detection rate of ductal carcinoma insitu and of tumour size T1, the recall rate for assessment, the positivepredictive value of recall and the cumulative 12-month incidence of intervalcancers. An adaptive statistical design with one interim analysis provides theoption to modify the design.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been approved by the local medicalethical committee (2016-132-f-S). Results will be submitted to internationalpeer-reviewed journals.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03377036; Pre-results.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
