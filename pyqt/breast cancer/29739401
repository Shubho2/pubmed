A concept describing the origin ofintra-tumoral heterogeneity is the cancer stem-cell hypothesis, proposing theexistence of cancer stem cells that can self-renew limitlessly and therefore leadto tumor progression. Clonal evolution in accumulated single cell genomicalterations is a further possible explanation in carcinogenesis. In this study,we addressed the question whether intra-tumoral heterogeneity can be reliablydetected in tissue-micro-arrays in breast cancer by comparing expression levelsof conventional predictive/prognostic tumor markers, tumor progression markersand stem cell markers between central and peripheral tumor areas.METHODS: We analyzed immunohistochemical expression and/or gene amplificationstatus of conventional prognostic tumor markers (ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6), tumorprogression markers (PTEN, PIK3CA, p53, Ki-67) and stem cell markers (mTOR, SOX2,SOX9, SOX10, SLUG, CD44, CD24, TWIST) in 372 tissue-micro-array samples from 72breast cancer patients. Expression levels were compared between central andperipheral tumor tissue areas and were correlated to histopathological grading.15 selected cases additionally underwent RNA sequencing for transcriptomeanalysis.RESULTS: No significant difference in any of the analyzed between central andperipheral tumor areas was seen with any of the analyzed methods/or results that showed difference. Except mTOR, PIK3CA and SOX9 (nuclear) protein expression, allmarkers correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with histopathological grading bothin central and peripheral areas.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that intra-tumoral heterogeneity of stem-cell andtumor-progression markers cannot be reliably addressed in tissue-micro-arraysamples in breast cancer. However, most markers correlated strongly withhistopathological grading confirming prognostic information as expressionprofiles were independent on the site of the biopsy was taken.DOI: 10.1186/s12967-018-1495-6 PMCID: PMC5941467PMID: 29739401
