Purpose To present an overview of studies concerning computer-aideddetection (CAD) in screening mammography for early detection of BC and comparediagnostic accuracy and recall rates (RR) of single reading (SR) with SR + CADand double reading (DR) with SR + CAD. Material and Methods PRISMA guidelineswere used as a review protocol. Articles on clinical trials concerning CAD fordetection of BC in a screening population were included. The literature searchresulted in 1522 records. A total of 1491 records were excluded by abstract and18 were excluded by full text reading. A total of 13 articles were included.Results All but two studies from the SR vs. SR + CAD group showed an increasedsensitivity and/or cancer detection rate (CDR) when adding CAD. The DR vs.SR + CAD group showed no significant differences in sensitivity and CDR. AddingCAD to SR increased the RR and decreased the specificity in all but one study.For the DR vs. SR + CAD group only one study reported a significant difference inRR. Conclusion All but two studies showed an increase in RR, sensitivity and CDR when adding CAD to SR. Compared to DR no statistically significant differences insensitivity or CDR were reported. Additional studies based on organizedpopulation-based screening programs, with longer follow-up time, high-volumereaders, and digital mammography are needed to evaluate the efficacy of CAD.DOI: 10.1177/0284185118770917 PMID: 29665706
