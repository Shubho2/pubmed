Polyelectrolyte complex coacervation method was used for production of CGNCs. Interaction studies were conducted byFourier-transform infra-red (FT-IR), differential scanning colorimetric (DSC),and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate any interaction between drug andexcipients. Physicochemical parameters, in vitro drug release and release kineticwere studied. In vitro cell viability study using Michigan Cancer Foundation-7(MCF-7) breast cancer cells was also investigated. CGNCs had a smooth surface andnanosize range with a positive surface charge and exhibited sustained drugrelease. Further, TMC loaded CGNCs were found to be more cytotoxic than the free drug in MCF-7. Thus CGNCs may be suitable for breast cancer treatment due todelivering the drug at the site of action for a prolonged period of time.DOI: 10.1080/02652048.2018.1477844 PMID: 29771175
