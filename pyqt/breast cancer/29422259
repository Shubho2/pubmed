We examined the influence of race, sociocultural factors, andprocess-of-care factors on initiation of adjuvant endocrine therapy in a raciallydiverse sample.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible women were originally recruited for the Narrowing the Gaps in Adjuvant Therapy Study (2006-2011). Sociocultural and process-of-carefactors were collected via telephone surveys before adjuvant therapy. Clinicalfactors were abstracted from charts. Penalized LASSO (least absolute shrinkageand selection operator) logistic regression model was used to identify variables associated with initiation.RESULTS: Of the 270 women, 55.6% were black and the rest were white. Most women(74.8%) initiated therapy. A significant interaction (P = .008) was found betweenrace and age. Black women aged ≤ 50 years had the lowest initiation (59.7%)compared to black women > 50 years (87.1%), white women ≤ 50 years (73.7%), orwhite women > 50 years (72.0%). Multivariate analysis found that younger blackwomen exhibited a marginally higher risk of noninitiation compared to older blackwomen. Additionally, ratings of financial access, presence of comorbidities, and levels of communication were all associated with endocrine therapy initiation.CONCLUSION: Black women ≤ 50 years of age and women with financial constraintsmay be important subgroups for interventions. Patient-provider communicationappears to be an important leverage point to foster therapy uptake.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.clbc.2017.12.002 PMID: 29422259
