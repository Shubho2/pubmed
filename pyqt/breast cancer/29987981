[Epub ahead ofprint]A pictorial review: multimodality imaging of benign and suspicious features offat necrosis in the breast.Tayyab SJ(1), Adrada BE(1), Rauch GM(1), Yang WT(1).Author information: (1)1 Diagnostic Radiology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ,Houston, TX , USA.Fat necrosis of the breast is a well-described benign entity that can result inunnecessary biopsy of breast lesions. The pathogenesis of fat necrosis is anon-suppurative inflammatory process of adipose tissue, which may be seen aftertrauma, surgery, biopsy, post-breast reconstruction, post-fat grafting,post-radiotherapy, infection, and duct ectasia, among other conditions.Clinically, these patients may be asymptomatic or may present with a palpablelump, skin tethering, induration, and occasionally axillary lymphadenopathy.Depending on the time at which diagnostic imaging is performed, fat necrosis can have highly variable appearances on different modalities as it evolves. This isdirectly related to whether inflammation or fibrosis is predominating within the lesion, and correlation with clinical history is paramount in evaluating thesepatients. This review aims to analyze benign and suspicious imaging features offat necrosis confirmed by tissue sampling. Knowledge of both benign andmalignant-appearing features of fat necrosis on conventional modalities such asmammography and ultrasound, as well as newer applications including digitalbreast tomosynthesis, PET/CT, and MRI, should help the radiologist minimize thenumber of unnecessary biopsies.DOI: 10.1259/bjr.20180213 PMID: 29987981
