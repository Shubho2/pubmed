In the present study, we examined the biological role of lncRNAgastric carcinoma highly expressed transcript 1 (GHET1) in breast cancer.METHODS: The expression of GHET1 was determined by qRT-PCR assay; CCK-8, colonyformation, Transwell invasion and migration assays detected breast cancer cellproliferation, invasion and migration; cell apoptosis and cell cycle weredetermined by flow cytometry; protein levels were determined by western blotassay.RESULTS: GHET1 was up-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, and the up-regulation of GHET1 was positively correlated with larger tumor size, advancedclinical stage, lymph node metastasis and shorter overall survival. Knockdown of GHET1 suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and inducedapoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in MCF-cells. Knockdown of GHET1 alsosuppressed the protein levels of N-cadherin, vimentin, and decreased the protein level of E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells. On the other hand, overexpression of GHET1promoted cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and inhibited cell apoptosisand increased cell population at S phase in BT-20 cells. Overexpression of GHET1 also promoted epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BT-20 cells.Furthermore, knockdown of GHET1 also suppressed in vivo tumor growth of MCF-7cells, and also decreased the protein levels of N-cadherin and vimentin, andincreased the protein levels of E-cadherin in the tumor tissues from the nudemice.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that GHET1 was up-regulated in breastcancer tissues and cell lines, and promoted breast cancer cell proliferation,invasion and migration by affecting EMT. Our study for the first time revealedthe biological functions of GHET1 in breast cancer.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-181250 PMID: 29843220
