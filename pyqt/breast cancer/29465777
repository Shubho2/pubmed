The aim of this study was to quantifythe expression of MAGE-A and NY-ESO-1 CTAs in breast cancer, and relate this toknown clinicopathological parameters.METHODS AND RESULTS: We surveyed MAGE-A and NY-ESO-1 expression in an unselected cohort of 367 breast tumours (of which 65 were TN), with accompanying clinicalfollow-up data, by using immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays.Relevant to their potential as vaccine targets in breast cancer, MAGE-A wasexpressed in 13% of cases, and NY-ESO-1 in 3.8%, with the majority of tumoursshowing fairly homogeneous staining within individual tissue cores (~85% of caseswith staining in >75% of tumour cells). Most NY-ESO-1-positive cases alsoexpressed MAGE-A (P = 2.06 × 10-9 ), and both were strongly associated with theTN phenotype (P < 0.0001), with the most proliferative and poorly differentiated cases, in paticular, showing genomic instability. This was characterised bycoexpression of c-Kit and TTK, and overexpression of p53.CONCLUSIONS: MAGE-A and NY-ESO-1 are frequently expressed in TN breast cancer(~47% and 17% of TN cases, respectively), suggesting that targeting them could befeasible in this patient group. Expression is reasonably homogeneous in positive cases, suggesting that immunohistochemical analysis of tissue biopsies would be areliable companion biomarker.© 2018 The Authors.
