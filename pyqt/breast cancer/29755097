Many clinical trials proved the effect of postoperative adjuvantchemotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC, which is recommended as grade C1 byClinical Guideline for Lung Cancer, however, induction treatment for clinicalN2-stageⅢA remains still controversial. We showed retrospective data ofconcurrent chemoradiotherapy using S-1 and cisplatin followed by surgery, whichmay provide a better prognosis for locally advanced NSCLC patients. In addition, we summarized the findings of prospective clinical trials for treatment ofclinical N2-stageⅢA NSCLC patients.PMID: 29755097
