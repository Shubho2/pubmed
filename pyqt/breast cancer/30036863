Epub 2018 Jul 23.Long-Term Response with Eribulin Mesylate in a Breast Cancer Patient: A CaseReport.Medici M, Fossile E.Despite the wide pharmacological armamentarium available for the treatment ofmetastatic breast cancer (MBC), long-lasting control of disease is challenging,especially in heavily pretreated patients. In this case report, we documented along-lasting complete response (CR) with eribulin in a relatively young womanwith MBC and bone metastasis, who did not benefit from prior chemotherapyregimens. Besides CR, the patient was able to maintain an excellent performancestatus and was free from the severe pain experienced before the initiation oferibulin. Noteworthy, eribulin treatment was very well tolerated, with only amild alopecia being reported; response was maintained also after a temporary doseinterruption and a therapeutic holiday due to non-treatment-related increase inliver enzymes and steatosis.Â© 2018 S.
