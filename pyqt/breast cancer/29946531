Intervention for an L-Dexincrease of >10 consisted of applying an over the counter (OTC) sleeve followedby re-evaluation after 4 weeks. The utilization of complex decongestivephysiotherapy (CDP) represented a surrogate for chronic BCRL.Results: Median follow-up was 24 months. 55% of patients received taxane-basedchemotherapy, 24% received some form of axillary irradiation (includes additionalfields or high tangents) and 66% had an elevated body mass index (BMI) with themedian number of nodes removed being 19. Overall, 75% of these patients had atleast one additional high-risk feature (taxane chemotherapy, axillary radiation, elevated BMI), 48% had at least two, and 6% had all. Thirty-three patients(35.4%) developed an elevated L-Dex score with only 10 (10.8%) requiring CDP(30.3% of those undergoing treatment with sleeve). At last follow-up, only three patients (3%) had unresolved BCRL.Conclusion: The results of this analysis support previous data regardingprospective BCRL surveillance and early intervention using BIS. With thisapproach, only 3% of patients have chronic BCRL.DOI: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00197 PMCID: PMC6006520PMID: 29946531
