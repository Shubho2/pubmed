Herein we describe the synthesis andpreliminary biological evaluation of three enzymatically activatabledoxorubicin-oligosaccharide prodrugs. The synthetic protocol allows late stagevariation of the carbohydrate and is compatible with the use of disaccharidessuch as lactose as well as more complex oligosaccharides such as xyloglucanoligomers. The enzymatic release of doxorubicin from the prodrugs by bothprotease (plasmin) and human carboxylesterases (hCE1 and 2) was demonstrated invitro and the cytotoxic effect of the prodrugs was assayed on MCF-7 breast cancercells.DOI: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00314 PMID: 29878753
