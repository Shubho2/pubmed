Moreover, easily accessible and innovative support is lacking.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this trial was to determine the effectiveness of anapp-based breast cancer e-support program to address women's self-efficacy(primary outcome), social support, symptom distress, quality of life, anxiety,and depression. Secondary objectives included exploring the association betweenwomen's health outcomes and the breast cancer e-support usage data.METHODS: A multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial wasconducted. A total of 114 women with breast cancer, who were commencingchemotherapy and were able to access internet through a mobile phone, wererecruited in the clinics from 2 university-affiliated hospitals in China. Womenwere randomized either to the intervention group (n=57) receiving breast cancere-support plus care as usual or the control group (n=57) receiving care as usual alone. The health care team and research assistants collecting data were blinded to the women's group allocation. Bandura's self-efficacy theory and the socialexchange theory guided the development of the breast cancer e-support program,which has 4 components: (1) a Learning forum, (2) a Discussion forum, (3) anAsk-the-Expert forum, and (4) a Personal Stories forum. Moderated by anexperienced health care professional, the breast cancer e-support programsupported women for 12 weeks covering 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Health outcomeswere self-assessed through paper questionnaires in clinics at baseline beforerandomization (T0), after 3 (T1), and 6 months (T2) of follow-ups.RESULTS: Fifty-five participants in the intervention group and 49 in the control group completed the follow-up assessments (response rate: 91.2%). During the12-week intervention, the log-in frequency ranged from 0 to 774 times (mean 54.7;SD 131.4; median 11; interquartile range, IQR 5-27), and the total usage durationranged from 0 to 9371 min (mean 1072.3; SD 2359.5; median 100; IQR 27-279).Repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance (intention-to-treat) found that breast cancer e-support + care as usual participants had significant better health outcomes at 3 months regarding self-efficacy (21.05; 95% CI 1.87-40.22;P=.03; d=0.53), symptom interference (-0.73; 95% CI -1.35 to -.11; P=.02;d=-0.51), and quality of life (6.64; 95% CI 0.77-12.50; P=.03, d=0.46) but notregarding social support, symptom severity, anxiety, and depression compared withcare as usual participants. These beneficial effects were not sustained at 6months. Spearman rank-order correlation showed that the breast cancer e-supportusage duration was positively correlated with self-efficacy (r=.290, P=.03),social support (r=.320, P=.02), and quality of life (r=.273, P=.04) at 3 months.CONCLUSIONS: The breast cancer e-support program demonstrated its potential as aneffective and easily accessible intervention to promote women's self-efficacy,symptom interference, and quality of life during chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR):ACTRN12616000639426; www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12616000639426.aspx (Archived byWebcite at http://www.webcitation.org/6v1n9hGZq).Â©Jiemin Zhu, Lyn Ebert, Xiangyu Liu, Di Wei, Sally Wai-Chi Chan.
