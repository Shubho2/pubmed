The expression of PCP4/PEP19 is induced byestrogens in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) MCF-7 cells but also highlyexpressed in ER- SK-BR-3 cells. In this study, we investigated the effects ofPCP4/PEP19 on aromatase gene expression in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cells. In SK-BR-3 cells but not in MCF-7 cells, PCP4/PEP19 knockdown by siRNAsilencing decreased the aromatase expression in gene transcriptional level. When PCP4/PEP19 was overexpressed by CMV promoter-driven PCP4/PEP19 expressing plasmidtransfection, aromatase gene transcription increased in SK-BR-3 cells. Thisaromatase gene transcription is mainly mediated through promoter region PI.1,which is usually active in the placental tissue but not in the breast cancertissue. These results indicate a new function of PCP4/PEP19 that would enhancearomatase gene upregulation to supply estrogens in heterogeneous cancermicroenvironment.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25651 PMCID: PMC6049867PMID: 30038708
