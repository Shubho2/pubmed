[Epub aheadof print][EXPRESS] Sinomenine attenuates cancer-induced bone pain via suppressingmicroglial JAK2/STAT3 and neuronal CAMKII/CREB cascades in rat models.Chen SP, Zhou YQ, Sun J, Cao F, Braun C, Luo F, Tian Y(1), Ye DW.Author information: (1)Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.which often occurs in patients with advanced prostate, breast, and lung cancer.It is of great significance to improve the therapies of CIBP due to the opioids' side effects including addiction, sedation, pruritus, and vomiting. Sinomenine, atraditional Chinese medicine, showed obvious analgesic effects on a rat model of chronic inflammatory pain, but has never been proven to treat CIBP. In thepresent study, we investigated the analgesic effect of sinomenine after tumorcell implantation (TCI) and specific cellular mechanisms in CIBP. Our resultsindicated that single administration of sinomenine significantly anddose-dependently alleviated mechanical allodynia in CIBP rats, and the effectlasted for 4 hours. After TCI, the protein levels of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, p-CAMKII,and p-CREB were persistently up-regulated in the spinal cord horn. Chronicintraperitoneal treatment with sinomenine markedly suppressed the activation ofmicroglia, and effectively inhibited the expression of JAK2/STAT3 and CAMKII/CREBsignaling pathways. We are the first to reveal that upregulation of microglialJAK2/STAT3 pathway are involve in the development and maintenance of CIBP.Moreover, our investigation provides the first evidence that sinomeninealleviates CIBP by inhibiting microglial JAK2/STAT3 and neuronal CAMKII/CREBcascades.DOI: 10.1177/1744806918793232 PMID: 30027795
