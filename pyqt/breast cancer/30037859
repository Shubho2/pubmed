Eighteen studies evaluated ICD-9 codes (11 ofwhich assessed both invasive breast cancer (code 174.x) and carcinoma in situ(ICD-9 233.0)); three studies evaluated invasive breast cancer-related ICD-10codes. All studies except one considered incident cases.The initial algorithmresults were: sensitivity ≥80% in 11 of 17 studies (range 57%-99%); positivepredictive value was ≥83% in 14 of 19 studies (range 15%-98%) and specificity≥98% in 8 studies. The combination of the breast cancer diagnosis with surgicalprocedures, chemoradiation or radiation therapy, outpatient data or physicianclaim may enhance the accuracy of the algorithms in some but not allcircumstances. Accuracy for breast cancer based on outpatient or physician's dataonly or breast cancer diagnosis in secondary position diagnosis resulted low.CONCLUSION: Based on the retrieved evidence, administrative databases can beemployed to identify primary breast cancer. The best algorithm suggested is ICD-9or ICD-10 codes located in primary position.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42015026881.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.
