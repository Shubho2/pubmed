Regarding BRCA-2mutations we identified c.9371A>T and c.8755-1G>A in 6 cases and we diagnosed VUSmutations in 3 cases.Conclusion: Our study identified 2 mutations in the BRCA1 gene that are lesscommon in the Romanian population, c.3607C>T and c.4035delA. Both variants hadparticular molecular phenotypes, c.3607C>T variant respecting the triple negativepattern of BRCA1 breast cancer while c.4035delA were Luminal B HER positive.DOI: 10.15386/cjmed-894 PMCID: PMC5958980PMID: 29785153
