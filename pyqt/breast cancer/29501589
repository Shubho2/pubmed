In breast epithelial MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells, Cd has been shown topromote cell growth. The present study examined whether Cd also promotesepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a hallmark of cancer progression. Human breast epithelial cells consisting of non-cancerous MCF10A, non-metastatic HCC1937 and HCC 38, and metastatic MDA-MB-231 were treated with 1 or 3 μM Cd for4 weeks. The MCF10A epithelial cells switched to a more mesenchymal-likemorphology, which was accompanied by a decrease in the epithelial markerE-cadherin and an increase in the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin. Inboth non-metastatic HCC 1937 and HCC 38 cells, treatment with Cd decreased theepithelial marker claudin-1. In addition, E-cadherin also decreased in the HCC1937 cells. Even the mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited an increase inthe mesenchymal marker vimentin. These changes indicated that prolonged treatmentwith Cd resulted in EMT in both normal and cancer-derived breast epithelialcells. Furthermore, both the MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells labeled with Zcad, adual sensor for tracking EMT, demonstrated a decrease in the epithelial markerE-cadherin and an increase in the mesenchymal marker ZEB-1. Treatment of cellswith Cd significantly increased the level of Snail, a transcription factorinvolved in the regulation of EMT. However, the Cd-induced Snail expression wascompletely abolished by actinomycin D. Luciferase reporter assay indicated thatthe expression of Snail was regulated by Cd at the promotor level. Snail wasessential for Cd-induced promotion of EMT in the MDA-MB-231 cells, as knockdownof Snail expression blocked Cd-induced cell migration. Together, these resultsindicate that Cd promotes EMT in breast epithelial cells and does so bymodulating the transcription of Snail.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
