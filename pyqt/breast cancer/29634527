[Epub ahead of print]Two-Level Continuous Thoracic Paravertebral Nerve Blocks Providing Opioid-FreePostoperative Analgesia After Latissimus Dorsi Flap Breast Reconstruction: A CaseReport.Swisher MW(1), Gabriel RA, Khatibi B.Author information: (1)From the Department of Anesthesiology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California.We present the case of a 55-year-old woman undergoing a delayed latissimus dorsi flap breast reconstruction after a simple mastectomy for breast cancer.Preoperatively, 2 unilateral paravertebral catheters were placed at T3/4 and T7/8for postoperative analgesia. Postoperatively, ropivacaine 0.2% was infused until the day of discharge on postoperative day 2. The patient had excellentpostoperative analgesia and required no opioids or other analgesics throughpostoperative day 10. We report that multilevel paravertebral nerve blockadecould represent an opioid-sparing alternative for postoperative analgesia forlatissimus dorsi flap breast reconstruction patients.DOI: 10.1213/XAA.0000000000000759 PMID: 29634527
