This investigation evaluated whether a topical balmcontaining steam-extracted, bioactive polyphenolic-rich herbal oils blended with organic waxes could protect the nails via their reported anti-inflammatory,analgesic, anti-oxidant and anti-microbial properties.METHODS: 60 patients (23M, 37F) were randomised to apply (2-3/day) either theplant balm (PB) or a petroleum control (PC) to their nail beds. Demographics,type and number of chemotherapy cycles did not differ between the two groups,recruited between Sept 2015 and Sept 2016. An unpaired t test was used to testthe differences in symptoms and physical nail damage between the two groups.RESULTS: Symptom scores recorded with the dermatology life quality questionnaire (DLQQ) were significantly better, between the start and end of chemotherapy, inthe group applying the PB versus PC. Likewise, the mean fall in nail damage,scored with the Nail Psoriasis Index by the supervising physician, was alsosignificantly different.CONCLUSION: The polyphenolic-rich essential oils and plant-based waxes in thisnail bed balm profoundly reduced chemotherapy-related nail damage and improvednail-related quality of life, compared to a control. A further analysis isplanned combining this balm with nail bed cooling.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4788-9 PMID: 29736742
