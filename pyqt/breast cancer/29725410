The present study compared theclinical characteristics of patients with MBC with or without a complete clinicalresponse (cCR) and identified the survival-associated factors. This was aretrospective study, which included 171 patients treated for MBC between 2011 and2017 at the Shiga Medical Center for Adults. Neutrophil to lymphocytes ratios(NLRs) were determined in blood samples. The median follow-up period followingdiagnosis of MBC was 44 months (range, 0-217 months). A total of 32 patients(18.7%) achieved a cCR. Compared with the non-cCR group, the cCR group hadsignificantly fewer metastases or recurrences (P<0.001), significantly fewervisceral metastases (P<0.001), a significantly lower NLR (P<0.001) and werediagnosed with primary breast cancer at a significantly earlier stage (P=0.003). Prognosis was significantly improved in the cCR group compared with the non-cCRgroup (P<0.001) and a high NLR (â‰¥19) independently predicted worse survival in a multivariate analysis (P=0.0218; hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval,1.09-2.85). In conclusion, the present study determined that achieving a cCR and having a low NLR are important for the long-term survival of patients with MBC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8145 PMCID: PMC5920503PMID: 29725410
