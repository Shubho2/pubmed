Graphene oxide-polyethylene glycol (GO-PEG) is a novel nanoscale carrier material and can elevate solubility and biocompatibility ofdrugs. This study prepared a GO-PEG-DOX complex, whose toxicity and antitumoreffects were evaluated on mouse EMT-6 breast cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: GO-PEG-DOX complex was prepared for calculating the drugcarrier rate of DOX on GO-PEG by MV approach. EMT-6 cells were treated with40 μg/mL GO-PEG, 1 μg/mL DOX, or 40 μg/mL +1 μg/mL GO-PEG-DOX for 72 h ofincubation. Cells without treatment were considered the control group. Cellsurvival rate and apoptotic rate were tested at different time points.RESULTS: GO-PEG and GO-PEG-DOX complex were successfully prepared withsatisfactory solubility. After 72 h of incubation, EMT-6 cells after GO-PEG-DOXtreatment had significantly higher survival rate than GO-PEG group (p < 0.05).All three treatment groups had significantly elevated apoptotic rates thancontrol group (p < 0.05). GO-PEG-DOX group had much more apoptosis (p < 0.05compared with DOX group). Moreover, with elongated treatment time, all groupsshowed decreased survival rate (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: GO-PEG did not reduce the cytotoxicity of DOX on EMT-6 cells.GO-PEG-DOX complex can increase the water solubility and targeting sensitivity ofDOX, with facilitating effects on DOX-induced tumor cell apoptosis.DOI: 10.1089/cbr.2017.2348 PMID: 29763376
