Electronic address: rossana.galassi@unicam.it.Basal like breast cancer (BLBC) is a very aggressive subtype of breast cancergiving few chances of survival, against which cisplatin based therapy is acompromise among the anticancer activity, the resistance development and thesevere side effects. With the aim of finding new anticancer agents alternative tocisplatin, seven gold(I) azolate/phosphane compounds were evaluated in vitro byMTT tests in human MDA-MB-231, human mammary epithelial HMLE cells overexpressingFoxQ1, and murine A17 cells as models of BLBC. Two compounds,(4,5-dichloro-1H-imidazolate-1-yl)-(triphenylphosphane)-gold(I) 1 and(4,5-dicyano-1H-imidazolate-1-yl)-(triphenylphosphane)-gold(I) 2 were found very active and chosen for an in vivo study in A17 tumors transplanted in syngeneicmice. The compounds resulted to be more active than cisplatin, less nephrotoxicand generally more tolerated by the mice. This study also provides evidence that both gold(I) complexes inhibited the 19 S proteasome-associated deubiquitinaseUSP14 and induced apoptosis, while compound 1's mechanism of action depends also on its ability to down-regulate key molecules governing cancer growth andprogression, such as STAT3 and Cox-2.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
