In addition, the prognostic effectbetween 3 different chemotherapy regimens were compared in node-negative T1c TNBCpatients by subgroup analysis.METHODS: From the Korean breast cancer registry database, 1,151 T1c node negativeTNBC patients were included in this study. Patients were categorized into fourtreatment groups according to chemotherapy regimen: (1) no chemotherapy, (2)adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), (3) adriamycin/epirubicin pluscyclophosphamide plus 5-FU (FAC/FEC), and (4) cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU plusmethotrexate (CMF). Overall survival (OS) was evaluated between each patientgroup.RESULTS: Of the 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients, 1,006 received adjuvantchemotherapy, while 145 received no chemotherapy. Among the patients receivingadjuvant chemotherapy the distribution of regimens was: 586 AC, 168 FAC/FEC (126 FAC, 42 FEC), and 252 CMF. The mean follow-up time of the full study cohort was87.98 Â± 33.56 months (range = 6-192 months). Patients in the no chemotherapygroup showed significantly worse OS compared to each chemotherapy regimen group. However, when OS was compared between each chemotherapy regimen, no significantdifference was found.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that adjuvant systemic chemotherapy improved OS inT1c node negative TNBC patients, regardless of chemotherapy between AC, FAC/FEC, and CMF regimens.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197523 PMCID: PMC5955535PMID: 29768496
