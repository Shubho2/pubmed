A few cases havebeen reported in the literature criminalizing capecitabine, paclitaxel anddocetaxel. We report the case of a 64-year old female patient without a historyof autoimmune diseases or of drug allergy followed up for invasive ductalcarcinoma in the right breast immediately metastatized to the liver and to thelymph nodes. After AC60 first line chemotherapy regimen (a total of 6 cycles),she was treated with docetaxel at a dose of 100 mg/m2. After 5 cycles, she haddiffuse erythematous lesions on both hands, forearms, cheeks and on theperibuccal area. She underwent corticosteroid therapy with sun protection andcould continue the same chemotherapy until the eighth cycle. Patient's evolution was marked by the progression of the disease. She was treated with capecitabineat a dose of 1250 mg/m2 twice a day. After six cycles she had erythematosquamous and itchy patches on the face resembling the wings of a butterfly (Panel A, PanelB) with oral ulceration and digital pulpitis (Panel C). This initially suggested acute chemotherapy-induced cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Biopsy suggestedlichenoid toxidermia. Immunological assessment was performed to excludechemotherapy-induced cutaneous lupus erythematosus, which showed anti-native DNA antibodies and negative anti-histone antibodies. Anti-nuclear antibody test ispositive at 320; this test may be positive in 50-70% of patients with breastcancer, ENT or lymphoma. In the light of these results the diagnosis oftoxidermia was the more likely.DOI: 10.11604/pamj.2018.29.66.6083 PMCID: PMC5987104PMID: 29875947  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
