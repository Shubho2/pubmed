Although several studies havereported that RECQL mutations were correlated with the susceptibility to breastcancer, the effect on prognosis in breast cancer was not yet clarified. Here, we explored the association between RECQL expression level and survival in patients with breast cancer.METHODS: In the first cohort, the RECQL mRNA expression level was evaluated in774 primary breast cancer patients using a quantitative real-time PCR assay.Then, in the second independent cohort, the level of RECQL protein expression wasdetected in 322 patients with breast cancer using immunohistochemistry assay.Survival curves of patients with RECQL expression were compared using theKaplan-Meier method with log-rank test.RESULTS: In the first cohort of 774 breast cancer patients, the low expressionlevel of RECQL mRNA was significantly correlated with aggressiveclinicopathological characteristics, including the positive lymph node status(P = 0.026), HER2 overexpression (P < 0.001), ER negative status (P = 0.047) and high tumor grade (P = 0.041). Moreover, the low expression level of RECQL mRNAwas significantly associated with poor distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS,unadjusted hazard ratio (HR): 2.77, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.88-4.09,P < 0.001) and disease-specific survival (DSS, unadjusted HR: 3.10, 95% CI:1.84-5.20,P < 0.001), and it remained an independent unfavorable factor for DRFS and DSS (DRFS: adjusted HR: 3.04, 95% CI: 1.89-4.87, P < 0.001; DSS: adjusted HR:4.25, 95% CI: 2.12-8.46, P < 0.001). In the second cohort of 322 breast cancerpatients, low expression of RECQL protein was also subject to poor survival inbreast cancer, and it was an independent prognosis factor of poor DRFS bymultivariate analysis (DRFS: adjusted HR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.16-3.88, P = 0.015).CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients with low RECQL expression had a worsesurvival. The expression level of RECQL may be a potential prognosis factor forbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4585-1 PMCID: PMC6007067PMID: 29914420
