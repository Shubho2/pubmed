In this study, we evaluated therole of caveolin-1 (CAV-1) genotypes in the risk of breast cancer. PATIENTS ANDMETHODS: We evaluated 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the CAV-1 gene in asample size of 406 participants. Six polymorphisms-G32124A (rs3807992), T29107A(rs7804372), T28608A (rs3757733), G21985A (rs12672038), G14713A (rs3807987), and C521A (rs1997623)-were assessed using restriction fragment length polymorphismpolymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: Regarding the distribution of genotypes, the relationship between cases and controls was significant for T29107A, G21985A, G14713A, and C521Apolymorphisms, among which only C521A showed a significant difference in bodymass index between the 2 groups. Moreover, the age of the 2 groups wassignificant in the case of G32124A and T28608A polymorphisms.CONCLUSION: Our results showed that genetic changes of CAV-1 might modify therisk for breast cancer and point out the importance of more studies for variants of this gene in breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
