[Epub ahead ofprint]Treatment Patterns and Survival of Elderly Patients With Breast Cancer BrainMetastases.Leone JP(1), Haraldsson B(2), Mott SL(3), McDowell BD(3), Chrischilles EA(2).Author information: (1)Department of Medical Oncology, Breast Oncology Program, Dana-Farber CancerInstitute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.(2)Department of Epidemiology, University of Iowa College of Public Health.(3)University of Iowa, Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, Iowa City, IA.OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to analyze treatment patterns ofelderly patients with breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM), evaluatecharacteristics associated with treatment selection, and to analyze trends inoverall survival (OS) over time.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included women with BCBM reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare Program from 1992 to 2012. Treatments wererecorded from Medicare claims from the date of brain metastases diagnosis until60 days after. Treatments included resection, radiation, and chemotherapy.Cochran-Armitage tests were used for analysis of treatment patterns. Multinomial logistic regression was applied to determine factors associated with treatmentselection. Cox regression modelled OS trends within each treatment modalityacross time.RESULTS: Among 5969 patients included, treatment rates increased from 50% in 1992to 64.1% in 2012 (P<0.01). Therapy combining radiation, resection, and/orchemotherapy also increased from 8.8% to 18% over the same period (P<0.01).Combined therapy was significantly more likely among patients with extracranialmetastases, those with estrogen-negative tumors, younger age at diagnosis, nocomorbidities and more recently diagnosed brain metastases. OS improved over timefor patients who received a combination of ≥2 treatments (hazard ratio, 0.89 per every 5 more recent diagnosis years; P<0.05). Older patients, those withextracranial metastases, or estrogen/progesterone-negative tumors showedsignificantly shorter OS.CONCLUSIONS: We observed substantial changes in treatment patterns and OS overtime in patients with BCBM. We identified several factors associated withspecific treatment use. Patients who underwent a combination of ≥2 treatmentsexperienced a significant improvement in OS over time.DOI: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000477 PMID: 29965807
