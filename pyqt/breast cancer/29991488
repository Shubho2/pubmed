The relationships between thereceipt of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Anth-bC) and changes in LV mass and heart failure (HF) symptomatology are unknown, as is their relationship to LVejection fraction (LVEF), a widely used measurement performed in surveillancestrategies designed to avert symptomatic HF associated with cancer treatment.METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed blinded, serial assessments of body weight,LVEF and mass, LV-arterial coupling, aortic stiffness, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire measures before and 6 months after initiating Anth-bC(n=61) and non-Anth-bC (n=15), and in 24 cancer-free controls using paired t and χ2 tests and multivariable linear models. Participants averaged 51±12 years, and 70% were women. Cancer diagnoses included breast cancer (53%), hematologicmalignancy (42%), and soft tissue sarcoma (5%). We observed a 5% decline in both LVEF (P<0.0001) and LV mass (P=0.03) in the setting of increased aortic stiffnessand disrupted ventricular-arterial coupling in those receiving Anth-bC but notother groups (P=0.11-0.92). A worsening of the Minnesota Living with HeartFailure Questionnaire score in Anth-bC recipients was associated with myocardial mass declines (r=-0.27; P<0.01) but not with LVEF declines (r=0.11; P=0.45).Moreover, this finding was independent of LVEF changes and body weight.CONCLUSIONS: Early after Anth-bC, LV mass reductions associate with worsening HF symptomatology independent of LVEF. These data suggest an alternative mechanismwhereby anthracyclines may contribute to HF symptomatology and raise thepossibility that surveillance strategies during Anth-bC should also assess LVmass.© 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.DOI: 10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.117.004560 PMID: 29991488
