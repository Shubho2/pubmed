Additionally, we compared the prevalence of distant metastases orpalpable second cancers between the biannual and annual groups. The institutionalreview board of our institution approved this retrospective study, and patientconsent was waived. Between January 2011 and December 2012, we retrospectivelyreviewed the clinical and imaging follow-up of 3023 patients with mammographicand US surveillance after breast cancer surgery to assess second cancers detectedby local surveillance (locoregional recurrence, contralateral breast cancer ordistant metastasis). The biannual and annual groups were divided with respect to the mean surveillance interval and compared with respect to clinicopathologicfindings. Multivariable logistic regression with propensity score methods wasused to examine the effect of the type of surveillance on outcomes. As for thesize of the second cancer, no difference was seen between the biannual and annualgroups (12.8 ± 6.6 mm vs. 14.1 ± 7.1 mm, p = 0.461); neither was there asignificant difference between the groups in the presence of symptoms at the timeof diagnosis of the second cancer (17.0% [8/47] vs. 10% [2/20], p = 0.711).Regardless of detection by local surveillance, the prevalence of distantmetastases did not differ between the two groups (1.1% [27/2370] vs. 1.0%[7/653], p = 0.88) on univariate or multivariate analysis. The results of ourretrospective study indicate that second cancers detected by biannual USsurveillance in patients with a history of breast cancer surgery are not smaller and do not occur earlier than those detected by annual US surveillance. However, a randomized controlled study is required to verify these results before they canbe generalized to clinical practice.Copyright © 2018 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology.Published by Elsevier Inc.
