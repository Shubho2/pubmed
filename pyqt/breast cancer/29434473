There is acontinued interest for the development of more efficacious treatment regimens forbreast carcinoma. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-relatedapoptosis-inducing ligand (rhTRAIL) shows potential as a potent anticancertherapeutic for the treatment of breast cancer, whereas displaying minimaltoxicity to normal cells. However, the promise of rhTRAIL for the treatment ofbreast cancer is dismissed by the resistance to rhTRAIL-induced apoptosisexhibited by many breast cancers. Thus, a cotreatment strategy was examined byapplying the natural compound quercetin (Q) as a sensitizing agent forrhTRAIL-resistant breast cancer BT-20 and MCF-7 cells. Quercetin was able tosensitize rhTRAIL-resistant breast cancers to rhTRAIL-induced apoptosis asdetected by Western blotting through the proteasome-mediated degradation ofc-FLIPL and through the upregulation of DR5 expression transcriptionally.Overall, these in vitro findings establish that Q is an effective sensitizingagent for rhTRAIL-resistant breast cancers.DOI: 10.1177/1178223417749855 PMCID: PMC5802616PMID: 29434473
