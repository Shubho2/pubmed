Furthermore,studies suggest a role for androgens in female-hormone-dependent cancers andcommon nonhormone dependent cancers. This study aims to review key studies andmore recent studies of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and cancer risk.RECENT FINDINGS: Epidemiological studies are reassuring as they have notassociated endogenous androgens with prostate cancer risk. Intraprostaticregulation of DHT is becoming recognized as an important area of research toclarify the role of DHT in prostate cancer development. In females, furtherunderstanding of intracrine regulation of sex hormones and interactions betweenandrogens and estrogens in influencing breast and endometrial cancer risk arerequired. Studies show a signal for DHT in modulating lung and colorectal cancer growth; however, research in this area is relatively scarce and further studiesare required to clarify these associations.SUMMARY: Although concerns of prostate cancer risk remain, there is alsopotential for androgens to modulate the growth and development of other commoncancers. Further research is required as this may have clinical implications.DOI: 10.1097/MED.0000000000000411 PMID: 29465427
