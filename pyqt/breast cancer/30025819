Trials of HLA-restricted peptide vaccines have beendifficult to enroll given HLA subtype restrictions. It is necessary to determine the prognostic significance of HLA-status in breast cancer if patients who areineligible to receive a vaccine due to their HLA-status are used as controls. Theimpact of targeted tumor associated antigen expression, when it effectseligibility is also important. We examined control patients from two randomizedphase II trials that tested HER2-peptide vaccines to determine the effect ofHLA-A2 status and HER2 expression on disease-free survival. The analysis showedthat HLA-A2-status does not affect disease-free survival, regardless of HER2expression suggesting that HLA-A2 negative patients can be used as controlpatients. Additionally, HER2 over-expression was associated with a betterdisease-free survival in this population, underscoring the need for additionaltherapies in HER2 low-expressing breast cancer.
