Electronic address: hehongpeng@tust.edu.cn.Deposition of type I collage in ECM is an important property of various fibrotic diseases including breast cancer. The excessive expression of type I collagencontributes to the rigidity of cancer tissue and increases the mechanicalstresses which facilitate metastasis and proliferation of cancer cells via theactivation of TGF-β signaling pathway. The increased mechanical stresses alsocause the compression of blood vessels and result in hypoperfusion and impaireddrug delivery in cancer tissue. Additionally, type I collage functions as theligand of α2β1-integrin and DDR1/2 receptors on the membrane of cancer cells toinitiate signal transduction leading to metastasis. The expression of type Icollage in cancer cells is previously shown to be inducible by TGF-β however the detailed mechanism by which the synthesis of type I collagen is regulated inbreast cancer cells remains unclear. Herein, we report that MRTF-A, aco-activator of SRF, is important for the regulation of type I collagen geneCOL1A1 in breast cancer cells. MRTF-A physically interacted with the promoter of COL1A1 to facilitate histone acetylation and RNA polymerase II recruitment. TheRhoC-ROCK signaling pathway which controls the nuclear localization of MRTF-Aregulated the transcription of COL1A1 in human breast cancer cells. TGF-β and Wntsignaling increased the expression of both MRTF-A and COL1A1. Furthermore,depletion of MRTF-A abolished the upregulation of COL1A1 in response to the TGF-βor Wnt signaling, indicating the importance of MRTF-A in the synthesis of type I collagen in breast cancer. Given the crucial roles of type I collagen in theformation of metastasis-prone and hypoperfusion microenvironment, MRTF-A would bea potential target for the development of anti-breast cancer activities.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
