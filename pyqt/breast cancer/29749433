Inhibition of this signaling pathway has yielded promising resultsin a number of human cancers, including breast, melanoma and colon. However, the effects of CXCR1/2 antagonist treatment on pancreatic cancer remain unclear. The present study aimed to demonstrate that treatment with the clinical grade CXCR1/2antagonist, reparixin, or the newly discovered CXCR1/2 antagonist, SCH527123, mayresult in a reduction of the malignant features associated with this lethalcancer. The effects of reparixin or SCH527123 exposure on human pancreatic cancercell lines BxPC‑3, HPAC, Capan‑1, MIA PaCa‑2, and AsPC‑1 were examined in regard to cell proliferation, cell viability, colony formation and migration. Theeffects of CXCR1/2 inhibition on the protein expression of well-known downstream effectors, including phosphorylated (p)-signal transducer and activator oftranscription 3 (STAT3), p‑RAC‑α serine/threonine-protein kinase (p‑AKT),p‑extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p‑ERK1/2) and p‑ribosomal protein S6(p‑S6), were assessed by western blotting assays. The effects of IL‑8 signalingon the proliferative activities intrinsic to the human pancreatic cancer celllines Capan‑1, AsPC‑1 and HPAC were examined by bromodeoxyuridine assay.Treatment with either reparixin or SCH527123 yielded dose-dependent growthsuppressive effects on HPAC, Capan‑1 and AsPC‑1 cells that may have otherwiseundergone robust proliferation upon IL‑8 stimulation. In addition, reparixin orSCH527123 treatment inhibited CXCR1/2-mediated signal transduction, asdemonstrated by the decreased phosphorylation levels of effector molecules STAT3,AKT, ERK and S6 that are downstream of the IL‑8/CXCR1/2 signaling cascade in HPACcells. These data were in close agreement with the reduced cell migration andcolony formation. Results from the present study suggested that reparixin andSCH527123 may be promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of pancreaticcancer by inhibiting the IL‑8/CXCR1/2 signaling cascade.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4389 PMID: 29749433
