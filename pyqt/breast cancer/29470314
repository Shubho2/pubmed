P2X7activation contributes to the proinflammatory response to injury or bacterialinvasion and mediates apoptosis. Recently, P2X7 function has been linked tochronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. P2X7 may contribute to pain modulationboth by effects on peripheral tissue injury underlying clinical pain states, and through alterations in central nervous system processing, as suggested by animal models. To further test its role in pain sensitivity, we examined whethervariation within the P2RX7 gene, which encodes the P2X7 receptor, was associated with experimentally induced pain in human patients. Experimental pain wasassessed in Tromsø 6, a longitudinal and cross-sectional population-based study(N = 3016), and the BrePainGen cohort, consisting of patients who underwentbreast cancer surgery (N = 831). For both cohorts, experimental pain intensityand tolerance were assessed with the cold-pressor test. In addition, multisitechronic pain was assessed in Tromsø 6 and pain intensity 1 week after surgery wasassessed in BrePainGen. We tested whether the single-nucleotide polymorphismrs7958311, previously implicated in clinical pain, was associated withexperimental and clinical pain phenotypes. In addition, we examined effects ofsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms rs208294 and rs208296, for which previous resultshave been equivocal. Rs7958311 was associated with experimental pain intensity inthe meta-analysis of both cohorts. Significant associations were also found formultisite pain and postoperative pain. Our results strengthen the existingevidence and suggest that P2X7 and genetic variation in the P2RX7-gene may beinvolved in the modulation of human pain sensitivity.DOI: 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001188 PMCID: PMC5965926PMID: 29470314
