The regulatory limit for nitrate in public drinking watersupplies was set to protect against infant methemoglobinemia, but other healtheffects were not considered. Risk of specific cancers and birth defects may beincreased when nitrate is ingested under conditions that increase formation ofN-nitroso compounds. We previously reviewed epidemiologic studies before 2005 of nitrate intake from drinking water and cancer, adverse reproductive outcomes and other health effects. Since that review, more than 30 epidemiologic studies have evaluated drinking water nitrate and these outcomes. The most common endpointsstudied were colorectal cancer, bladder, and breast cancer (three studies each), and thyroid disease (four studies). Considering all studies, the strongestevidence for a relationship between drinking water nitrate ingestion and adverse health outcomes (besides methemoglobinemia) is for colorectal cancer, thyroiddisease, and neural tube defects. Many studies observed increased risk withingestion of water nitrate levels that were below regulatory limits. Futurestudies of these and other health outcomes should include improved exposureassessment and accurate characterization of individual factors that affectendogenous nitrosation.DOI: 10.3390/ijerph15071557 PMCID: PMC6068531PMID: 30041450
