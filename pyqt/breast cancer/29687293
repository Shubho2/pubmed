Mammary gland (MG) development is a time whenphysiologic and environmental exposures influence breast cancer risk. However,the effect of psychosocial stress exposure on MG development remains unknown.Here, in the first comprehensive longitudinal study of MG development innulliparous female rats (from puberty through young adulthood; 8-25 wks of age), we quantify the spatial gradient of differentiation within the MG of sociallystressed (isolated) and control (grouped) rats. We then demonstrate that socialisolation increased stress reactivity to everyday stressors, resulting indownregulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression in the MG epithelium.Surprisingly, given that chemical carcinogens increase MG cancer risk bypreventing normal terminal end bud (TEB) differentiation, chronic isolationstress did not alter TEBs. Instead, isolation blunted MG growth and alveolobular differentiation and reduced epithelial cell proliferation in these structures.Social isolation also enhanced corpora luteal progesterone at all ages butreduced estrogenization only in early adulthood, a pattern that precludesmodulated ovarian function as a sufficient mechanism for the effects of isolationon MG development. This longitudinal study of natural variation provides anintegrated view of MG development and the importance of increased GR activationin nulliparous ductal growth and alveolobular differentiation. Thus, socialisolation and its physiological sequelae disrupt MG growth and differentiationand suggest a contribution of stress exposure during puberty and young adulthood to the previously observed increase in invasive MG cancer observed in chronicallysocially-isolated adult Sprague-Dawley rats.DOI: 10.1007/s10911-018-9392-4 PMID: 29687293
