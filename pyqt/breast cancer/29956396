The newer Patient Reported OutcomesMeasurement Information System (PROMIS) and previously developed measures ofsimilar conceptual content (legacy) are available to measure symptoms andfunctioning. This report compares the performance of two sets of measures, PROMISand legacy, in a recently completed trial of a supportive care intervention that enrolled breast cancer patients and their friend or family caregivers.METHODS: Patient-caregiver dyads (N = 256) were randomized to either reflexology delivered by caregivers or usual care control. Post-intervention, PROMIS andlegacy measures of symptoms and functioning were analyzed in relation to trialarm, while adjusting for baseline values. Responsiveness of the two sets ofmeasures was assessed using effect sizes and P-values for the effect of trial armon patients' and caregivers' symptom and functioning outcomes.RESULTS: Similar conclusions about intervention effects were found using PROMISand legacy measures for pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, physical, and socialfunctioning. Different conclusions were obtained for patient and caregiverdepression: legacy measures indicated the efficacy of reflexology, while PROMISdepression measure did not.CONCLUSION: Evidence of similar responsiveness supports the use of either set of measures for symptoms and functioning in clinical and general populations.Differences between PROMIS and legacy measures of depression need to beconsidered when choosing instruments for use in trials of supportive careinterventions and in clinical practice.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4825 PMID: 29956396
