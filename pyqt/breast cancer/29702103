This family of microRNAs maintain mammary epithelial identity anddownregulation of miR-200 expression has been associated withepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mammary tumors. Therefore, re-expression of one or more miR-200 family members in mammary tumor cells with mesenchymalcharacteristics may restore an epithelial phenotype including growth andmetastasis suppression. To test this hypothesis, the miR-200b/200a/429 clusterwas re-expressed in a murine claudin-low cell line, RJ423. Re-expression of themiR-200b/200a/429 cluster in RJ423 cells significantly suppressed the expression of Vim, Snai1, Twist1, Twist2 and Zeb1, reverted RJ423 cells to a more epithelialmorphology and significantly inhibited proliferation in vitro. Moreover, themiR-200b/200a/429 cluster prevented lung metastasis in an experimental metastasismodel and although tumor initiation was not prevented, re-expression of themiR-200b/200a/429 cluster induced a dormancy-like state where mammary tumorsfailed to grow beyond ~150 mm3 or grew extremely slowly following intra-mammaryinjection. These dormant tumors contained elevated levels of collagen and werehighly vascularized. Therefore, re-expression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster inthe claudin-low mammary tumor cell line, RJ423, is sufficient to alter cellmorphology, impair metastasis and induce tumor dormancy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
