Herewe describe the identification of NDF, a nucleosome-destabilizing factor thatfacilitates Pol II transcription in chromatin. NDF has a PWWP motif, interactswith nucleosomes near the dyad, destabilizes nucleosomes in an ATP-independentmanner, and facilitates transcription by Pol II through nucleosomes in a purifiedand defined transcription system as well as in cell nuclei. Upon transcriptional induction, NDF is recruited to the transcribed regions of thousands of genes and colocalizes with a subset of H3K36me3-enriched regions. Notably, the recruitment of NDF to gene bodies is accompanied by an increase in the transcript levels ofmany of the NDF-enriched genes. In addition, the global loss of NDF results in a decrease in the RNA levels of many genes. In humans, NDF is present at highlevels in all tested tissue types, is essential in stem cells, and is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer. These findings indicate that NDF is anucleosome-destabilizing factor that is recruited to gene bodies duringtranscriptional activation and facilitates Pol II transcription throughnucleosomes.Â© 2018 Fei et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.DOI: 10.1101/gad.313973.118 PMCID: PMC6004073 [Available on 2018-11-01]PMID: 29759984  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
