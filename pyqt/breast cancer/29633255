In this work, we demonstrated that regulatory activity at -356 to-100 bp promoter element plays a critical role in governing HDAC5 transcription. By using DNA affinity precipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified a group of factors that bind to this element. Among these factors, Upstream TranscriptionFactor 1 (USF1) was shown to play a critical role in controlling HDAC5transcription. Through screening a panel of epigenetic modifying drugs, we showedthat a natural bioactive HDAC inhibitor, sulforaphane, downregulated HDAC5transcription by blocking USF1 activity. Sulforaphane facilitated LSD1ubiquitination and degradation in an HDAC5-dependent manner. A comparativemicroarray analysis demonstrated a genome wide cooperative effect of HDAC5 andLSD1 on cancer-related gene expression. shRNA knockdown and sulforaphaneinhibition of HDAC5/LSD1 exhibited similar effects on expression of HDAC5/LSD1target genes. We also showed that coordinated cross-talk of HDAC5 and LSD1 isessential for the antitumor efficacy of sulforaphane. Combination treatment with sulforaphane and a potent LSD1 inhibitor resulted in synergistic growthinhibition in breast cancer cells, but not in normal breast epithelial cells.Furthermore, combined therapy with sulforaphane and LSD1 inhibitor exhibitedsuperior inhibitory effect on MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor growth. Taken together, our work demonstrates that HDAC5-LSD1 axis is an effective drug target for breastcancer. Inhibition of HDAC5-LSD1 axis with sulforaphane blocks breast cancergrowth and combined treatment with LSD1 inhibitor improves the therapeuticefficacy of sulforaphane.Â© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31419 PMID: 29633255
