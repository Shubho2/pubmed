However,the expression profile and function of circRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain unknown. In the current study, we investigated the expressionprofile of human circRNAs in TNBC tissues and identified circEPSTI1 (hsa_circRNA_000479) as a significantly upregulated circRNA. Methods: We performedcircular RNA microarray assays to screen circular RNA expression profiles of TNBCand further investigated circEPSTI1. We observed the effect of circEPSTI1 onproliferation, clonal formation and apoptosis in TNBC by knocking downcircEPSTI1 in three TNBC cell lines. Based on the MRE analysis and luciferase reporterassay, we found that circEPSTI1 binds to miRNAs as a miRNA sponge and theco-target genes of miRNAs. We performed xenograft experiments in mice to confirm our findings. We evaluated circEPSTI1 levels in 240 TNBC patients by ISH.Results: Knockdown of circEPSTI1 inhibits TNBC cell proliferation and inducesapoptosis. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that circEPSTI1 binds tomiR-4753 and miR-6809 as a miRNA sponge to regulate BCL11A expression and affect TNBC proliferation and apoptosis. High levels of circEPSTI1 correlate withreduced survival in TNBC patients. Conclusions: ThecircEPSTI1-miR-4753/6809-BCL11A axis affect the proliferation and apoptosis oftriple-negative breast cancer through the mechanism of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA). In addition, our results identify circEPSTI1 as an independentprognostic marker for survival in patients with TNBC.DOI: 10.7150/thno.24106 PMCID: PMC6071524PMID: 30083277
