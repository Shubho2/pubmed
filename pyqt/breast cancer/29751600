These tumours typically occur inwomen aged 30⁻70 years. The occurrence of these tumours in older children andadolescents poses particular diagnostic and therapeutic problems. However, early diagnosis is mandatory because although most of the cases of PTs in children are benign, the borderline and malignant cases with potential negative outcomescannot be excluded. Case presentation: A 12-year-old girl presented at thePaediatric Emergency Department for hyperaemia and warmth of the left breast thatoccurred a few days prior without fever. The girl experienced menarche 8 monthspreviously. She experienced no previous trauma and she had no family history ofbreast cancer. On physical examination, the left breast was painful, enlarged andtender. The overlying skin was erythematous and warm. A breast ultrasonography(US) revealed a large mass with features of an abscess, including a hyperechoicwall, scattered internal echoes and hypoechoic peripheral lacunae of apparentcolliquative nature. After 4 days of unsuccessful antibiotic therapy, surgicaldrainage was performed due to the suspicion of a mammary abscess. At the surgicalincision site, the lesion was not-well circumscribed and lacked a capsule. Inaddition, purulent material was not detected. Histological examination revealedthat the tissue alterations were compatible with benign PT. With this diagnosis, the girl underwent definitive surgical removal of the lesion. The postoperativeperiod passed without negative events. An US performed 6 months later revealedthat no new mass was present at this time, suggesting no recurrence of thetumour. Conclusion: This case shows that in the presence of a clinical picturesuggesting the inflammation of the breast in adolescent females, PT should beconsidered as a possible diagnosis and US-guided core biopsy should be consideredto confirm this suspicion. Thereafter, when surgical excision is performed,particular attention must be paid to both the preservation of all the normalbreast parenchyma and future aesthetic problems.DOI: 10.3390/ijerph15050959 PMCID: PMC5981998PMID: 29751600
