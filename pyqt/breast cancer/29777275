In this study, we aimed toinvestigate the role of ATP-binding cassette sub-family B, member 4 (ABCB4) inacquired doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells, as well as its potential mechanism.METHODS: In doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cell lines MCF-7and MDA-MB-231, the expression levels of ABCB4 were detected using real-timequantitative PCR and Western blot analysis, the DNA methylation and histoneacetylation status of ABCB4 gene were investigated by bisulfite-sequencing PCR(BSP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and the doxorubicinsensitivity and intracellular doxorubicin accumulation were observed using cellcytotoxicity assay and flow cytometry. In Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCKII)cells, In vitro transport assay was used to assess the ABCB4-mediated transportof doxorubicin.RESULTS: ABCB4 was overexpressed in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cellscompared to their doxorubicin-sensitive counterparts, which was associated withreduced DNA methylation as well as increased histone acetylation at the ABCB4promoter. ABCB4 could actively pump doxorubicin out of the cells, and knockdownof ABCB4 increased doxorubicin sensitivity and intracellular accumulation indoxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ABCB4 is overexpressed in breast cancercells with acquired doxorubicin resistance, which could be attributed, at leastpartially, to the epigenetic modifications of ABCB4 gene. ABCB4 mediates theefflux transport of doxorubicin, and contributes to the acquired resistance ofdoxorubicin in breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3603-y PMID: 29777275
