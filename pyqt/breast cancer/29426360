However, for PPV calculation, all nonmalignant tissue changes areequally considered false-positive, although the respective prognostic importance,and thus patient management implications, of different pathologies may welldiffer. We investigated the pathology of false-positive diagnoses made by MRIcompared with radiographic (digital mammography/tomosynthesis [DM/DBT])screening.METHODS: We conducted an institutional review board-approved prospective analysisof 710 consecutive asymptomatic women at average risk for breast cancer whounderwent vacuum biopsy with or without surgical biopsy for screen-detectedDM/DBT (n = 344) or MRI (n = 366) findings. We compared the frequency offalse-positive biopsies (given by PPV3), as well as the types of nonmalignanttissue changes that caused the respective false-positive biopsies. In an order ofincreasing relative risk of subsequent breast cancer, pathologies offalse-positive biopsies were categorized as nonproliferative, simpleproliferative, complex proliferative, or atypical proliferative (includinglobular carcinoma in situ/lobular intraepithelial neoplasia). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare distributions.RESULTS: Histology yielded nonmalignant tissue in 202 of 366 biopsies done forpositive MRI studies and 195 of 344 biopsies for positive DM/DBT studies,respectively, yielding a similar PPV3 percentages of 44.8% (164 of 202) and 43.3%(149 of 202) for both methods. However, the distribution of tissue types thatcaused false-positive diagnoses differed significantly (p < 0.0001). On the basisof MRI, high-risk atypical proliferative changes (40.1%; 81 of 202) were mostcommon, followed by complex proliferative changes (23.8%; 48 of 202). In DM/DBT, low-risk, nonproliferative changes were the dominant reason for false-positivediagnoses (49.7%; 97 of 195), followed by simple proliferative changes (25.2%; 51of 195). Low-risk nonproliferative changes resulted in false-positive diagnosesbased on MRI as infrequently as did high-risk atypical proliferative changesbased on DM/DBT (18.8% [38 of 202] vs. 18.0% [35 of 195]). The likelihood of afalse-positive diagnosis including atypias was twice as high in women undergoing biopsy for MRI findings (81 of 202; 40%) as for those with DM/DBT findings (35 of195; 18%).CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic importance, and thus the clinical implications, offalse-positive diagnoses made on the basis of breast MRI vs. radiographicscreening differed significantly, with a reversed prevalence of high- andlow-risk lesions. This should be taken into account when discussing the rate offalse-positive diagnoses (i.e., PPV levels of MRI vs. radiographic screening).Current benchmarks that rate the utility of breast cancer screening programs(i.e., cancer detection rates and PPVs) do not reflect these substantialbiological differences and the different prognostic implications.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0937-7 PMCID: PMC5807753PMID: 29426360
