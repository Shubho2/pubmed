We investigated the influence of time to adjuvant chemotherapy on outcome in TNBC patients.Methods: Female patients with stage I-IIIa operable TNBC between 2006 and 2008 inour institutions were included. A total of 331 patients were divided into 3groups according to the time to adjuvant chemotherapy: ≤30, 31-60, and >60 days. Relapse free survival (RFS) were calculated and compared.Results: Prolonged delay of initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy (≤30 versus >60days) significantly decreased the RFS in our TNBC cohort [adjusted hazard ratio(HR) of 2.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-5.07, P=0.02]. While a moderate delay (≤30 versus 31-60 days) did not significantly influence RFS in all TNBCpatients, it did compromise survival in lymph node positive patients (P=0.04).Conclusions: Longer delay of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with worsesurvival in TNBC patients. Early initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy should beconsidered, especially for relatively high risk node positive TNBCs.DOI: 10.21037/jtd.2018.04.94 PMCID: PMC6006075PMID: 29997947
