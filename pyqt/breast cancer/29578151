The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression level andfunctional role of miR-186 in human cutaneous malignant melanoma cells.Subjects and Methods: Expression of miR-186 was analyzed in human cutaneousmalignant melanoma (CMM) cell lines SK-MEL-1, G-361, A375 and A875, and humannormal epidermal melanocytes cell line HEMn-LP by quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Additionally, the functionalrole of miR-186 on melanoma cells was investigated by transfection of miR-186mimic followed by analyses of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis.Results: We found that the expression levels of miR-186 were decreased in CMMcell lines compared with normal epidermal melanocytes cell line. Moreover,overexpression of miR-186 inhibited cells proliferation through abrogating theG1-S transition, and reduced cells migration and invasion.Conclusions: Our findings suggested that miR-186 exhibit an inhibitory effect on CMM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; thus, may serve as a potentialtherapeutic target for human CMM intervention.DOI: 10.4103/0973-1482.157340 PMID: 29578151
