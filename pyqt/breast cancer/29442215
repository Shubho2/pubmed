The pooled risk radio (RR) orstandard mean difference (SMD) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals(CIs) were calculated using the RevMan 5.3 software.RESULTS: A total of 5 studies were included in this meta-analysis. There were 551breast cancer patients receiving mastectomy plus breast reconstruction and 574breast cancer patients receiving mastectomy alone. The results showed that breastreconstruction can significantly decrease the incidence of anxiety (RR = 0.62,95% CI 0.47-0.82, P = 0.0006)/depression (RR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.93, P = 0.02) and scale score for evaluating anxiety (SMD = - 0.20, 95% CI - 0.37 to - 0.03,P = 0.02)/depression (SMD = - 0.22, 95% CI - 0.39 to - 0.66, P = 0.007) compared with mastectomy alone.CONCLUSIONS: Breast reconstruction after mastectomy was benefit for improving thepsychological damages in patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0846-8 PMID: 29442215
