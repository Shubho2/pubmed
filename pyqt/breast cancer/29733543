Foster School of Medicine, EL Paso, Texas.Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer death in Hispanic/Latino women nationwide. Hispanic women are more likely to be presented with advanced disease and adverse prognosis subtypes. The aim of this study is to describe the clinico-pathological characteristics and disparities in breast cancer in this group attwo tertiary care University-based medical centers. After IRB approval, Cancerregistry was used to analyze the variables of 3441 patients with breast cancerdiagnosed and treated consecutively at two large tertiary University basedmedical and cancer center database centers in El Paso, TX and Loma Linda, CAbetween 2005 and 2015. Association between race/ethnicity and cancer type, stage,hormone receptor status and treatment option were investigated. Overall 45.5% of the patients were Hispanic (n: 1566) and those were more likely to be diagnosedat a younger age (57 years) similar to African Americans, more likely to haveinvasive ductal carcinoma type (82.7%) & triple negative disease (17.1%, 95%CI:15% to 19%). 58.8% of Hispanics (95%CI: 56% to 61%) have hormone receptor (HR)+ &HER2- as opposed to 71% in non-Hispanic White people. In addition, Hispanicindividuals presented with advanced stages of BC (25.3%, 95% CI: 23% to 28%)similar to African American (25.4%), and had a lower proportion of lumpectomy(50%) similar to African American (50%). When compared to African Americanpatients, Hispanic patients had a higher prevalence of triple negative BC (17.11%in Hispanics Versus 13.86% in African American).CONCLUSION: Hispanics hadsignificantly higher relative risk of advanced stages at presentation (RelativeRisk Ratio (RRR) = 2.05, P < 0.001), triple negative tumors (RRR = 2.64,P < 0.0001), HER2 + /HR - disease (RRR = 1.77, P < 0.0001), and less HR+ /HER2-BC (RRR = 0.69, P < 0.0001). Hispanics and African Americans are diagnosed withbreast cancer at a younger age, have a higher prevalence of Triple negativebreast cancer, and are diagnosed at more advanced stages of disease. Increasingawareness and targeting minority populations for health promotion interventions, screening and early detection continue to be of paramount importance to reducethe burden of health disparities.© 2018 The Authors.
