Pathologists' assessment of lesion subtypes is considered as the gold standard, however,sometimes strong disagreements among pathologists for distinction among lesionsubtypes have been previously reported in the literature.OBJECTIVE: To propose a framework for classifying hematoxylin-eosin stainedbreast digital slides either as benign or cancer, and then categorizing cancerand benign cases into four different subtypes each.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data from a publicly available database (BreakHis)of 81 patients where each patient had images at four magnification factors (×40, ×100, ×200, and ×400) available, for a total of 7786 images. The proposedframework, called MuDeRN (MUlti-category classification of breasthistopathological image using DEep Residual Networks) consisted of two stages. Inthe first stage, for each magnification factor, a deep residual network (ResNet) with 152 layers has been trained for classifying patches from the images asbenign or malignant. In the next stage, the images classified as malignant weresubdivided into four cancer subcategories and those categorized as benign wereclassified into four subtypes. Finally, the diagnosis for each patient was madeby combining outputs of ResNets' processed images in different magnificationfactors using a meta-decision tree.RESULTS: For the malignant/benign classification of images, MuDeRN's first stage achieved correct classification rates (CCR) of 98.52%, 97.90%, 98.33%, and 97.66%in ×40, ×100, ×200, and ×400 magnification factors respectively. For eight-class categorization of images based on the output of MuDeRN's both stages, CCRs infour magnification factors were 95.40%, 94.90%, 95.70%, and 94.60%. Finally, for making patient-level diagnosis, MuDeRN achieved a CCR of 96.25% for eight-classcategorization.CONCLUSIONS: MuDeRN can be helpful in the categorization of breast lesions.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
