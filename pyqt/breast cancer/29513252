Overtreatment is also given to patients withcancer, including those who need surgery. Overtreatment is closely related to theproblem of overdiagnosis. In patients with cancer, unnecessary surgery may cause complications and generates unnecessary costs. The size of the problem ofunnecessary surgery in patients with cancer can best be shown among patients withthe most common cancers, which dedicated screening programs. Breast cancerpatients, particularly those with pre-invasive types of the tumor, who typically have ductal carcinoma in situ (80%), are likely to undergo unnecessary surgery.We describe the most common clinical problems caused by overtreating patientswith ductal carcinoma in situ.DOI: 10.5604/01.3001.0011.5964 PMID: 29513252
