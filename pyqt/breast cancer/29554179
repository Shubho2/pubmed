We then performed difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD)analyses to determine whether observed changes in cancer screening associatedwith ACO enrollment were different across strata of appropriateness, definedusing age (65-74 years vs ≥75 years) and predicted survival (top vs bottomquartile).Main Outcomes and Measures: Rates of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancerscreening measured yearly as a proportion of eligible Medicare beneficiariesundergoing relevant screening services.Results: Among Medicare beneficiaries, comprising 39 218 652 person-years before MSSP enrollment and 17 252 345 person-years after MSSP enrollment, breast cancer screening declined among both ACO (42.7% precontract, 38.1% postcontract) andnon-ACO (37.3% precontract, 34.1% postcontract) populations. The adjusted rate ofdecline (DD) in the ACO population exceeded the non-ACO population by 0.79%(P < .001). This decline was most pronounced among elderly women (-2.1%), withminimal observed change among younger women (-0.26%). Baseline colorectal cancer screening rates were lower than those for breast cancer among both ACO (10.1%precontract, 10.3% postcontract) and non-ACO (9.2% precontract, 9.1%postcontract) populations. We observed an adjusted 0.24% (P = .03) increase inscreening associated with ACO enrollment, most pronounced among younger Medicare beneficiaries (0.36%). For breast and colorectal cancer, we observedstatistically significant differences in estimates of effect between age strata, suggesting that the ACO effect on cancer screening is mediated by age (DDD forboth P < .001). Prostate cancer screening declined among ACO (35.1% precontract, 28.5% postcontract) and non-ACO (31.2% precontract, 25.7% postcontract)populations. The adjusted rate of decline in the ACO population exceeded that of the non-ACO population by 1.2%. We observed no difference in estimate of effectbetween age strata, suggesting that the ACO-mediated changes in prostate cancerscreening are similar among younger and elderly men. Results characterizingappropriateness with predicted survival mirrored those when stratified by age.Conclusions and Relevance: Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO enrollment isassociated with more appropriate breast and colorectal screening, although themagnitude of the observed ACO effect is modest in the early ACO experience.DOI: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.8087 PMCID: PMC5876897PMID: 29554179
