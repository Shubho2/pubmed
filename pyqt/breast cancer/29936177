Electronicaddress: zliang@emory.edu.Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is among the most aggressive breast cancersubtypes with poor prognosis. The purpose of this study is to better understandthe molecular basis of TNBC as well as develop new therapeutic strategies. Ourresults demonstrate that HDAC9 is overexpressed in TNBC compared to non-TNBC celllines and tissues and is inversely proportional with miR-206 expression levels.We show that HDAC9 selective inhibition blocked the invasion of TNBC cellsin vitro and repressed the angiogenesis shown via in vivo Matrigel plug assays.Subsequent HDAC9 siRNA knockdown was then shown to restore miR-206 while alsodecreasing VEGF and MAPK3 levels. Furthermore, the inhibition of miR-206neutralized the action of HDAC9 siRNA on decreasing VEGF and MAPK3 levels. Thisstudy highlights HDAC9 as a mediator of cell invasion and angiogenesis in TNBCcells through VEGF and MAPK3 by modulating miR-206 expression and suggests thatselective inhibition of HDAC9 may be an efficient route for TNBC therapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
