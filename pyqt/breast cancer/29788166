The Anne Arundel Medical Center(AAMC) model has previously been shown to accurately predict RS risk categoriesusing standard pathology data. A pathologic-genomic (P-G) algorithm then ispresented using the AAMC model and reserving the RS assay only for AAMCintermediate-risk patients.Patients and methods: A survival analysis was done using a prospectivelycollected institutional database of newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers that underwent RS assay testing from February 2005 to May 2015. Patients were assignedto risk categories based on the AAMC model. Using Kaplan-Meier methods, 5-yeardistant recurrence rates (DRR) were evaluated within each risk group and comparedbetween AAMC and RS-defined risk groups. Five-year DRR were calculated for theP-G algorithm and compared with DRR for RS risk groups and the AAMC model's risk groups.Results: A total of 1268 cases were included. Five-year DRR were similar between the AAMC low-risk group (2.7%, n = 322) and the RS < 18 low-risk group (3.4%,n = 703), as well as between the AAMC high-risk group (22.8%, n = 230) and theRS > 30 high-risk group (23.0%, n = 141). Using the P-G algorithm, more patients were categorized as either low or high risk and the distant metastasis rate was3.3% for the low-risk group (n = 739) and 24.2% for the high-risk group(n = 272). Using the P-G algorithm, 44% (552/1268) of patients would have avoidedRS testing.Conclusions: AAMC model is capable of predicting 5-year recurrences in high- and low-risk groups similar to RS. Further, using the P-G algorithm, reserving RS forAAMC intermediate cases, results in larger low- and high-risk groups with similarprognostic accuracy. Thus, the P-G algorithm reliably identifies a significantportion of patients unlikely to benefit from RS assay and with improved abilityto categorize risk.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy074 PMCID: PMC5961181 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29788166
