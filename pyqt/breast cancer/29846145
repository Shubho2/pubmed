In this paper, we propose a new long-term survivor hazard model, whichaccommodates comprehensive families of cure rate models as particular cases,including modified Weibull, exponentiated Weibull, Weibull, exponential andRayleigh distribution, among others. The maximum likelihood estimation procedure is presented. A simulation study evaluates bias and mean square error of theconsidered estimation procedure as well as the coverage probabilities of theparameters asymptotic and bootstrap confidence intervals. A real Braziliandataset on breast cancer illustrates the methodology. From the practical point ofview, under our modelling, we provide a parameter that works as a metric toquantify and compare the risk between different stages of the disease. Weemphasize that, we developed an online platform for oncologists to calculate the probability of survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer according to thestage of the disease in real time.DOI: 10.1177/0962280216673245 PMID: 29846145
