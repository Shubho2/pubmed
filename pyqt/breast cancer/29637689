However, little is knownas to whether a clinical pathway is effective for thyroid cancer.METHODS: The study subjects included 216 patients who were managed after clinicalpathway implementation and 145 control patients. Length of stay, cost perpatient, and nurses' satisfaction were compared in the 2 groups.RESULTS: Mean length of stay was 0.8 days shorter in the clinical pathway groupthan in the control group (2.9 vs 3.7 days; P = .023). Cost per patient was also lower in the clinical pathway than in the control group (USD $3953.00 vs USD$4636.00; P < .001). Nurses' overall satisfaction scores improved from 71.6%before to 82.5% after implementation of the clinical pathway and their jobcharacteristics scores increased from 61.1% to 75.0%.CONCLUSION: Implementation of a clinical pathway for thyroid cancer can improvenurses' satisfaction with reduction of hospital stay and costs.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/hed.25175 PMID: 29637689
