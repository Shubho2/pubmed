Categorical variables were summarizedand Chi-square testing used to assess factors contributing to screeningcompliance. The effect of functional factors on screening was evaluated usinglogistic regression.RESULTS: 77 women (65.3%) had mammograms within the past two years; 56 (47.5%)were screening mammograms. Severity of fine motor deficits was associated withlack of screening (OR 0.559, p = 0.019). 85 (72.0%) experienced positive staffattitudes. Facilities most often met needs for ramps, elevators, and/or widedoorways (92.9%), exam explanations (84.4%), and accessible parking (82.5%).Needs least often met included accommodations for standing (59.3%) or fordifficulties with arm/shoulder positioning (57.1%), and wheelchair-accessiblemammogram machines (59.1%).CONCLUSIONS: The screening compliance rate for women with CP is low, although the2-year mammography rate is comparable to that reported for WWD and the generalfemale U.S.POPULATION: Women were usually offered respectful care. Adequate physicalaccommodations during the procedure were reported less often than overallfacility environmental accommodations. These findings demonstrate the need forimproved screening rates in women with CP, and highlight areas for improvingtheir screening experience.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
