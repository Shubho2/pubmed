Lapa is a novel therapeutic agent that generates ROS through the catalysis of the NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) enzyme whichsignificantly facilitate the intracellular accumulation of the co-delivered DOXto overcome MDR in cancer cells.Purpose: Herein, in our study, nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) co-deliveringÎ²-lapachone (Lapa) and doxorubicin (DOX) was developed (LDNLC) with the aim toovercome the multidrug resistance (MDR) in breast cancer therapy.Patients and methods: Lapa and DOX were loaded into NLC to prepare LDNLC usingmelted ultrasonic dispersion method.Results: The well designed LDNLC was nanoscaled particles that exhibitedpreferable stability in physiological environment. In vitro cell experiments onMCF-7 ADR cells showed increased DOX retention as compared to DOX mono-deliveryNLC (DNLC). In vivo anti-cancer assays on MCF-7 ADR tumor bearing mice model alsorevealed significantly enhanced efficacy of LDNLC than mono-delivery NLCs (DNLCand LNLC).Conclusion: LDNLC might be a promising platform for effective breast cancertherapy.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S163929 PMCID: PMC6047616PMID: 30034236
