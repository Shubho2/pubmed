However, these benefits come at the cost of increased radiation dose. Synthesized mammography (s2D) hasbeen developed to provide the advantages of DBT with nearly half the radiationdose. Since its F.D.A. approval, multiple studies have evaluated the clinicalperformance of s2D. In clinical practice, s2D images are not identical toconventional 2D images and are designed for interpretation with DBT as acomplement. This article reviews the present literature to assess whether s2D is a practical alternative to conventional 2D, addresses the differences inmammographic appearance of findings, and provides suggestions for implementation into clinical practice.DOI: 10.3390/diagnostics8020022 PMCID: PMC6023509PMID: 29617294
