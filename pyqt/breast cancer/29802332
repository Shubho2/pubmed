Betulinic acid (BA) is a naturallyoccurring pentacyclic triterpenoid with potent anticancer bioactivities inmultiple malignancies, whereas its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here in,we found that BA has synergistic effects with taxol to induce breast cancer cellsG2/M checkpoint arrest and apoptosis induction, but had little cytotoxicityeffects on normal mammary epithelial cells. Drug affinity responsive targetstability (DARTS) strategy further identified glucose-regulated protein 78(GRP78) as the direct interacting target of BA. BA administration significantlyelevated GRP78-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and resulted in theactivation of protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK)/eukaryotic initiation factor2a/CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein apoptotic pathway. GRP78silencing or ER stress inhibitor salubrinal administration was revealed toabolish the anticancer effects of BA, indicating the critical role of GRP78 inmediating the bioactivity of BA. Molecular docking and coimmunoprecipitationassay further demonstrated that BA might competitively bind with ATPase domain ofGRP78 to interrupt its interaction with ER stress sensor PERK, thereby initiatingthe downstream apoptosis cascade. In vivo breast cancer xenografts finallyvalidated the chemosensitizing effects of BA and its biofunction in activatingGRP78 to trigger ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our study not onlyuncovers GRP78 as a novel target underlying the chemosensitizing effects of BA,but also highlights GRP78-based targeting strategy as a promising approach toimprove breast cancer prognosis.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0669-8 PMCID: PMC5970196PMID: 29802332
