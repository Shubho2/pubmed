Interrogation ofthe METABRIC cohort suggested that MED7 may regulate lymphovascular invasion(LVI). Thus MED7 expression was assessed in large breast cancer (BC) cohorts todetermine clinicopathological significance.METHODS: MED7 gene expression was investigated in the METABRIC cohort (n = 1980) and externally validated using bc-GenExMiner v4.0. Immunohistochemical expressionwas assessed in the Nottingham primary BC series (n = 1280). Associations withclinicopathological variables and patient outcome were evaluated.RESULTS: High MED7 mRNA and protein expression was associated with goodprognostic factors: low grade, smaller tumour size, good NPI, positive hormonereceptor status (p < 0.001), and negative LVI (p = 0.04) status. Higher MED7protein expression was associated with improved BC-specific survival within thewhole cohort and ER+/luminal subgroup. Pooled MED7 gene expression data in theexternal validation cohort confirmed association with better survival,corroborating with the protein expression. On multivariate analysis, MED7 proteinwas independently predictive of longer BC-specific survival in the whole cohortand Luminal A subtype (p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: MED7 is an important prognostic marker in BC, particularly inER+luminal subtypes, associated with improved survival and warrants futurefunctional analysis.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0041-x PMCID: PMC5931067 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29588513
