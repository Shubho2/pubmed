[Epub ahead of print]Quantum dot-based immunofluorescent imaging and quantitative detection of DNERand prognostic value in prostate cancer.Wang L(1), Wu Q(1), Zhu S(1), Li Z(1), Yuan J(2), Liu L(2), Yu D(2)(3), Xu Z(1), Li J(1), Sun S(1), Wang C(3).Author information: (1)Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University,Wuhan, Hubei, China.(2)Department of Pathology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei,China.(3)Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, WuhanUniversity, Wuhan, Hubei, China.DNER, Delta/Notch-like epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related receptor, is aneuron-specific transmembrane protein carrying extracellular EGF-like repeats.The prognostic value of DNER in prostate cancer has not been evaluated. Here weshowed that the up-regulation of DNER protein was observed in prostate cancerdetected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantum dot-based immunofluorescentimaging and quantitative analytical system (QD-IIQAS). However, a higher accuracyof measurements of DNER expression in prostate cancer was found by QD-IIQAS than by IHC (AUC = 0.817 and 0.617, respectively). DNER was significantly higher inpatients undergoing bone metastasis (P = 0.045, RR = 3.624). In addition, DNERoverexpression was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (P = 0.028,adjusted HR = 8.564) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.042, adjusted HR =3.474) in patients suffering prostate cancer. Thus, QD-IIQAS is an easy andaccurate method for assessing DNER and the DNER expression was an independentprognostic factor in prostate cancer.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-171107 PMID: 29843212
