This study aims to evaluatetreatment outcomes among children, adolescents and young adults with osteosarcomaover the three decades by the changes in the long-term relative survival.METHODS: Osteosarcoma incidence and relative survival data from Surveillance,Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries during 1984-2013 were analyzed.The survival differences over three decades, age, sex, race, and socioeconomicstatus (SES) were assessed by comparing Kaplan-Meier curves.RESULTS: The overall incidence of osteosarcoma kept relatively stable with 0.4per 100 000 in the three decades with the peak incidence occurring in the aged10-19 group. The 10-year relative survival rate (RSR) increased from 57.7% to61.0% in the three decades, with the greatest increase in the aged 0-9 group from48.2% to 65.7%. The 10-year RSR improved from 54.1% to 61.5% in males, and from62.4% to 63.0% in females, respectively, in the three decades. Furthermore,survival dramatically improved from 30% to 60% in the high-poverty group over thethree decades.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the overall incidence of osteosarcomaremained stable, with an improvement in survival in the three decades. Theimproved survival was greater in males than in females in the three decades.Furthermore, the survival significantly increased in high-poverty group, whichwas attributed to increasing improved health care system and patients with lowfinance can also have access to receiving effective and consistent treatmentwithout distinction.© 2018 The Authors.
