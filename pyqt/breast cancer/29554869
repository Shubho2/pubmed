Of these, 212 patients were included in the study. Patients were dividedinto 4 groups based on the time elapsed since completion of RT. The genericcancer questionnaire, EORTC QLQ-30, and the breast cancer-specific questionnaire,QLQ-BR23, were used to assess the QOL.RESULTS: Analysis of time elapsed since completion of RT and QOL revealed changesin the scores for role function with passage of time; the third year's scoreswere the highest. Pain symptoms during the 3rd and 4th years after RT were lower than those during the 1st and 2nd years after RT; scores for financialdifficulties fluctuated with passage of time; perception of own body scoresimproved within first 3Â years; sexual activity and enjoyment of sexual activityshowed a significant decrease during the 2nd to 4th year post RT. Scorespertaining to concerns about future state of health showed a significant increaseduring the 2nd to 4th year after RT, while breast symptoms score showedfluctuations with passage of time.CONCLUSIONS: Social function, pain symptoms, and concerns about future state ofhealth tended to improve with passage of time after RT. Other scales showed nocorrelation with time elapsed since completion of RT.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4207-y PMCID: PMC5859708PMID: 29554869
