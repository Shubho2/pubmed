China.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of matrine on breastcancer and its underlying mechanism. Matrine is a major component of Sophoraflavescens, exhibited antitumor activity in a number of neoplasms, includingbreast cancer. The present study revealed that matrine inhibited cell viabilityand induced apoptosis in 4T1 and MCF-7 cells in a dose- and time-dependent mannerin vitro. In addition, matrine suppressed the 4T1-tumor growth, inducedapoptosis, inhibited the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor anddownregulated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in vivo. All these findingsindicated that matrine may be a novel effective candidate for the treatment ofbreast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7519 PMCID: PMC5776934PMID: 29434864
