Electronic address: neumannc@upmc.edu.Increased reactive species (RS; reactive oxygen and nitrogen species) are abyproduct of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems, and critical in cancerdevelopment, including breast tumorigenesis. To investigate the role ofRS-related genes in breast cancer, expression levels of the most common annotatedgenes involved in regulating cellular RS levels and proteins that are substrates of RS in specific subtypes of breast cancer 9 were evaluated using public databases. Based on the premise that increased RS promote tumor formation, and breastcancer subtypes vary in aggressiveness, we hypothesized that specific RS geneexpression signatures are associated with breast cancer aggressiveness andpatient survival. We identified a group of genes (GSTK1, PRDX2, PRDX3 andSLC36A1) that differentiate Luminal B tumors in two clusters and predict survivalof patients with Luminal B breast cancers. Furthermore, network analyses of thesefour genes revealed an overlap of known LumB related pathways with those ofRS-related signaling, which included regulation of M-phase and mitochondrialfunctions.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
