Methods Breast tissue fragments obtained by incisional biopsy and surgical procedures of 37 women with ductal carcinoma in situ of thebreast were subdivided into two groups: Group A, composed of women with low-gradeductal carcinoma in situ, and Group B, women with high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. Survivin protein expression test was performed by immunohistochemistry,using a monoclonal antibody clone I2C4. The criterion to evaluate survivinimmunoexpression was based on the percentage of neoplastic cells that presentedbrown-gold staining. This criterion was positive when the percentage of stainedcells was ≥10%. Results The survivin protein was expressed in 22 out of 24 cases of high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (78%), whereas, in Group A, of low-gradeductal carcinoma in situ (n=13), it was positive in only 6 cases (21.40%;p=0.004). Conclusion The frequency of expression of survivin was significantlyhigher in the group of patients with high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ comparedto those in the low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ group.DOI: 10.1590/s1679-45082018ao4065 PMCID: PMC5968810PMID: 29694611  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
