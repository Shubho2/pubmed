Increasing evidence has suggested that miRNAfunctions in Adriamycin resistance in various types of cancer. microRNA-129-5p(miR-129-5p) has been considered a tumor-suppressive miRNA in several cancers,but its potential role in Adriamycin resistance in breast cancer has not beenfully elucidate. By qRT-PCR assay, we revealed that the expression of miR-129-5p was significantly decreased in breast cancer tissues and Adriamycin-resistantbreast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231/ADR, MCF-7/ADR). CCK-8, colony formation, woundhealing, Transwell invasion, and flow cytometric profiles were examined todetermine the influence of miR-129-5p on Adriamycin-resistant breast cancerin vitro. The upregulation of miR-129-5p decreased the IC50 concentration ofAdriamycin and invasion and promoted the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231/ADR cells in thepresence of Adriamycin, whereas the upregulation of Sex-Determining Region Y-Box 2 (SOX2) reversed these effects. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed thebinding of miR-129-5p to the 3'UTR of SOX2. Collectively, it was suggested thatmiR-129-5p suppresses Adriamycin resistance in breast cancer by directlytargeting SOX2.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
