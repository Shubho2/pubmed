A potentialsolution is to refer patients to existing PA community-based PA services.Methods: A process evaluation of referral of post-surgical patients withearly-stage breast cancer to cardiac rehabilitation exercise classes, leisurecentre with 3-month free leisure centre membership or telephone-delivered PAconsultations for 12 weeks. Quantitative data were collected about PA programmeuptake and reach, patient engagement with the PA programme, delivery and fidelityand PA dose. Qualitative data were collected about patient experiences of taking part in the PA programmes. Audio-recorded qualitative interviews of participants about the programmes were analysed thematically. Quantitative data were reported descriptively using means and SD.Results: In Phase I, 30% (n = 20) of eligible patients (n = 20) consented, 85%(n = 17) chose referral to leisure centre, and 15% (n = 3) chose cardiacrehabilitation. In Phase II, 32% (n = 12) consented, 25% (n = 3) chose leisurecentre and 75% (n = 9) chose telephone-delivered PA consultations. Walking atlight intensity for about an hour was the most common PA. All Phase Iparticipants received an induction by a cardiac rehabilitation physiotherapist orPA specialist from the leisure centre but only 50% of Phase II participantsreceived an induction by a PA specialist from the leisure centre. Four themeswere identified from qualitative interviews about programme choice: concernsabout physical appearance, travel distance, willingness to socialise andflexibility in relation to doing PA. Four themes were identified aboutfacilitators and barriers for engaging in PA: feeling better, feeling ill, weightmanagement, family and friends.Conclusions: The current community-based PA intervention is not yet suitable for a definitive effectiveness randomised controlled trial. Further work is needed tooptimise PR programme reach, PA dose and intervention fidelity.Trial registration: ISRCTN11183372.DOI: 10.1186/s40814-018-0297-1 PMCID: PMC5984397PMID: 29881639
