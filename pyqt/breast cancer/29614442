Such variants represent putative therapeutic targets, as maysomatic variants in the tumour. Germline and tumour molecular profiling isincreasingly utilised to facilitate personalisation of cancer treatment in suchindividuals.AIM: Considering AYAs with advanced solid tumours managed in a specialist drugdevelopment unit (DDU), the aims of this study were to investigate the use andimpact of: 1. Germline genetic assessment. 2. Tumour molecular profiling.METHODS: AYAs treated in the DDU at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 2002 and2016 were identified from departmental databases. Data regardingclinicopathological features, clinical assessments and germline and tumourgenetic testing were retrieved by chart review.RESULTS: The study cohort included 219 AYAs. Common cancer types included sarcoma(41, 19%); cervical (27, 12%); breast (25, 11%); ovarian (23, 11%) and colorectal(21, 10%) cancers. Germline testing was undertaken in 34 (16%) patients, 22 ofwhom carried a pathogenic variant. Using current testing criteria, an additional 32 (15%) would be eligible for germline testing based on their personal historyof cancer alone. Tumour testing was undertaken in 46 (21%) individuals. Somaticmutations were commonly identified in TP53 13 (28%); PIK3CA (8, 18%); KRAS (4,9%) and MET 5 (11%).DISCUSSION: A significant proportion of AYAs with advanced cancer have targetablesomatic or germline mutations. Consideration of familial risk factors andinclusion of germline testing wherever appropriate can complement tumour testing to optimise patient management and inform management of at-risk relatives.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
