The patients were followed up for 1-87 months(median 78). DNA from tumor tissues was isolated by the salting out procedure.The methylation status was assessed by nested methylation-specific PCR afterbisulfite modification of DNA.RESULTS: The frequency of p16 hypermethylated breast cancer cases wassignificantly higher in TNBC than in ER+PR+Her2- group (33; 54.1% vs. 20; 28.6%, p=0.00298). Co-methylated p16 and RASSF1A genes were more frequent in the TNBCthan in ER+PR+Her2- group (20; 32.8% vs. 10; 14.3%, p=0.0225). The same resultwas observed when hypermethylated BRCA1 gene was added in the analysis: 12; 19.7%vs. 3; 4.3%, p=0.00791. Although there was significant difference in disease-freesurvival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) between TNBC and ER+PR+Her2- group,further analysis of co-methylation of p16 and RASSF1A (p16+RASSF1A+) showed that DFS was significantly shorter in the patients with both genes co-methylated inTNBC than in ER+PR+Her-2- group (8/20; 40% vs. 2/10; 20%, p=0.03272).CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data indicate that hypermethylated p16 and RASSF1Acell-cycle inhibitor genes might be considered as biomarkers for bad prognosis inbreast cancer. Hypermethylation of these genes may influence the clinical diseasecourse, distinguishing a particular group of TNBC patients with even moreaggressive phenotype.PMID: 30003738
