The relationship betweenage at first birth and breast cancer risk is not clear for women with a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Thus, we undertook a case-control study of women witha BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation to study the effects of age at first full-term birthmatched for other reproductive factors.METHODS: Information about reproductive factors, including age at first birth as well as medical history, was collected from a routinely administered researchquestionnaire. There were 2,295 matched pairs of women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2mutation included in the final analysis.RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean age at first full-termbirth among the BRCA1 (24.9 vs. 25.2; P = 0.10) or BRCA2 mutation carriers (26.5 vs. 26.6 years; P = 0.80). Findings were similar in the analysis limited to caseswho were diagnosed with breast cancer prior to age 45.CONCLUSION: This matched analysis of a large number of BRCA mutation carrierssuggests that age at first birth has little influence on BRCA1 or BRCA2 breastcancer risk.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4822-y PMID: 29774471
