Electronic address: zhishan.wang@uky.edu.Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) usually displays more aggressive metastasis,the underlying mechanism is unclear. Previous studies showed that microRNA-205(miR-205) has controversial roles in cancer, however, its role in TNBC metastasisand the underlying mechanism have not been well-understood. In this study wefound that miR-205 expression level is extremely low in basal mesenchymal-likehighly migratory and invasive TNBC cells. Stably re-expressing miR-205 in TNBCcells significantly reduced their migration, invasion capability and cancer stem cell (CSC)-like property. Nude mouse orthotopic mammary xenograft tumor modelstudy revealed that miR-205 re-expression greatly decreases TNBC tumor growth andabolishes spontaneous lung metastasis. Mechanistic studies demonstrated thatmiR-205 inhibits TNBC cell metastatic traits and tumor metastasis bydown-regulating integrin α5 (ITGA5). Moreover, ITGA5 knockout using theCRISPR/Cas9 technique achieved the same strong inhibitory effect on TNBC cellCSC-like property and tumor metastasis as re-expressing miR-205 did. Furthermechanistic studies indicated that ITGA5 down-regulation by miR-205 re-expressionimpairs TNBC cell metastatic traits by inhibiting the Src/Vav2/Rac1 pathway.Together, our findings suggest that miR-205 and ITGA5 may serve as potentialtargets for developing effective therapies for metastatic TNBC.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
