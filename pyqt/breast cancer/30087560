An efficient strategy to meet the clinical cancer imagingneeds, beyond what two-photon absorption (2PA) offers, is to use longerexcitation wavelengths through three-photon absorption (3PA). A variety offluorescent dyes and nanoparticles (NPs) have been used in 3PA imaging. However, their nonlinear 3PA coefficient is often low necessitating high excitationpowers, which cause overheating, photodamage, and photo-induced toxicity. Dopedwide band gap semiconductors such as Mn:ZnS NPs have previously been used for 3PAbut suffer from poor 3PA coefficients.Methods: Here, we prepared ZnO NPs with intrinsic defects with high 3PAcoefficients using a polyol method. We functionalized them with peptides forselective uptake by glioblastoma U87MG cells and used breast cancer MCF-7 cellsas control for 3PA studies. Uptake was measured using inductively coupledplasma-mass spectrometry. Biocompatibility studies were performed using reactive oxygen species and cell viability assays.Results: We demonstrate that ZnO NPs, which have a band gap of 3.37 eV with anorder of magnitude higher 3PA coefficients, can facilitate the use of longerexcitation wavelengths 950-1,100 nm for bioimaging. We used the presenceintrinsic defects (such as O interstitials and Zn vacancies) in ZnO NPs to induceelectronic states within the band gap that can support strong visibleluminescence 550-620 nm without the need for extrinsic doping. The peptidefunctionalization of ZnO NPs showed selective uptake by U87MG cells unlike MCF-7 cells without the integrin receptors. Furthermore, all ZnO NPs were found to bebiocompatible for 3PA imaging.Conclusion: We show that defect-induced luminescence 550-620 nm in ZnO NPs (20nm) due to 3PA at longer excitation (975 nm) can be used for 3PA imaging of U87MGglioblastoma cells with lower background noise.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S165201 PMCID: PMC6061205PMID: 30087560
