LVEF and LV strain (global longitudinal[GLS] andcircumferential[GCS]) measurements were independently measured by 2 blindedreaders.RESULTS: Of the 41 patients, 56% received anthracycline-based chemotherapy.Compared to baseline (60.4%, 95%CI 59.2-61.7%), there was a small but significantreduction in LVEF at 6 months (58.4%, 95%CI 56.7-60.0%, p = 0.034) and 12 months (57.9%, 95%CI 56.4-59.7%, p = 0.012), but not at 18 months (60.2%, 95%CI58.2-62.2%, p = 0.93). Similarly, compared to baseline, GLS and GCS decreasedsignificantly at 6 months (p = 0.024 and < 0.001, respectively) and 12 months(p = 0.002 and < 0.001, respectively) with an increase in LV end-diastolicvolume, but not at 18 months. There were significant correlations between thetemporal (6 month-baseline) changes in LVEF, and all global strain measurements(Pearson's r = -0.60 and r = -0.75 for GLS and GCS, respectively, all p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: There was a significant reduction in LV strain during trastuzumabtreatment, which correlated with a concurrent subtle decline in LVEF and wasassociated with an increase in LV end-diastolic volume. LV strain assessment byCMR may be a promising method to monitor for subclinical myocardial dysfunctionin breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Future studies are needed todetermine its prognostic and therapeutic implications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.03.041 PMID: 29555336
