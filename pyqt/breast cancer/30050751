Independent prognostic factors for SMFS andOS were extracted using univariate and multivariate analyses, the Kaplan-Meiermethod and the Cox proportional hazards model.Results: The mean time between primary diagnoses and spinal metastases was 46.8(median 41, range 0-147 months) months. The analysis showed that lymph nodemetastasis (p = 0.043, HR 10.498, 95%CI 1.074-102.588) and estrogen receptor (ER)status (p = 0.004, HR 0.368, 95%CI 0.189-0.721) can significantly affect SMFS.Furthermore, visceral metastasis (p = 0.042, HR 2.383, 95%CI 1.032-5.501),multiple metastases (p = 0.035, HR 2.538, 95%CI 1.066-6.048) and post-opchemotherapy (p = 0.003, HR 0.312, 95%CI 0.144-0.675) have significant effects onOS. Lastly, patients identified as Luminal A subtype have longer OS.Conclusions: Lymph node metastases and ER status are independent risk factors in predicting BCSM. Moreover, visceral metastasis, multiple metastases of the spine and post-op chemotherapy are independent prognostic factors. Luminal subtypeshave higher rate, but late onset of spine metastases and prolonged survival.DOI: 10.1016/j.jbo.2018.03.003 PMCID: PMC6058005PMID: 30050751
