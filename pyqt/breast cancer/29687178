Preventive therapy could create socioeconomic inequalities in cancerincidence if it is more readily accepted by particular socio-demographic groups. In this multicentre study, we investigated uptake of tamoxifen and evaluatedsocio-demographic and clinical factors associated with initiation. We exploredwomen's experiences of treatment decision-making using qualitative interviewdata.METHODS: Between September 2015 and December 2016, women (n = 732) attending anappointment at one of 20 centres in England to discuss breast cancer risk wereapproached to complete a survey containing socio-demographic details andnulliparity. Of the baseline survey respondents (n = 408/732, 55.7% responserate), self-reported uptake of tamoxifen at 3-month follow-up was reported in 258(63.2%). Sixteen women participated in semi-structured interviews.RESULTS: One in seven (38/258 = 14.7%) women initiated tamoxifen. Women who hadchildren were more likely to report use of tamoxifen than those without children (OR = 5.26; 95%CI: 1.13-24.49, p = 0.035). Interview data suggested that womenweigh up risks and benefits of tamoxifen within the context of familialcommitments, with exposure to significant other's beliefs and experiences ofcancer and medication a basis for their decision.CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of tamoxifen is low in clinical practice. There were nosocio-demographic differences in uptake, suggesting that the introduction ofbreast cancer preventive therapy is unlikely to create socioeconomic inequalitiesin cancer incidence. Women's decision-making was influenced by familialpriorities, particularly having children.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4775-1 PMCID: PMC6022517PMID: 29687178
