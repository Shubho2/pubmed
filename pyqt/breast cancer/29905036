Ultrasound is the bestnoninvasive evaluation for the ALN status. However, the correlation betweennegative ultrasound results and the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) pathology remains unknown. To test the hypothesis that negative ultrasound results of ALN predictthe negative pathology results of SLN in breast cancer patients, we assessed the association between ALN ultrasonography-negative results and the SLN pathology in3115 patients with breast cancer recruited between October 2010 and April 2016from a single cancer center, prospective database. Of these patients who met the inclusion criteria, 2317 (74.4%) had no SLN pathological metastasis. In theunivariate analysis, other 798 patient with positive SLN tended to be under age40 and premenopausal, having large tumor sizes (>2 cm), higher histological gradeof primary tumor, positive hormone receptors, and negative HER-2 status (P < .05 for all). In the multivariate analysis, menstrual status, tumor size, ER statusand histological types of primary tumor remained to be independent predictors forSLN pathological metastasis. The area under curve (AUC) was 0.658 (95%CI = 0.637-0.679), P > .05. In conclusion, only a 74.4% consistency between ALNultrasonography-negative results and negative pathological SLN results, although menstrual status, tumor size, histologic subtypes of primary tumor and ER status were found to be statistically independent predictors of positive SLN amongpatients negative for ALN ultrasonography. Therefore, the present study suggests that negative ultrasound results of ALN do not adequately predict the negativepathology results of SLN in breast cancer patients.© 2018 The Authors.
