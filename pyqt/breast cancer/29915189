Yetreported values of cell stiffness and viscosity vary substantially, whichsuggests differences in how the results of different methods are obtained oranalyzed by different groups. To address this issue and illustrate thecomplementarity of certain approaches, here we present, analyze, and criticallycompare measurements obtained by means of some of the most widely used methodsfor cell mechanics: atomic force microscopy, magnetic twisting cytometry,particle-tracking microrheology, parallel-plate rheometry, cell monolayerrheology, and optical stretching. These measurements highlight how elastic andviscous moduli of MCF-7 breast cancer cells can vary 1,000-fold and 100-fold,respectively. We discuss the sources of these variations, including the level of applied mechanical stress, the rate of deformation, the geometry of the probe,the location probed in the cell, and the extracellular microenvironment.DOI: 10.1038/s41592-018-0015-1 PMID: 29915189
