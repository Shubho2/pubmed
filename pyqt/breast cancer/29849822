Inthis study, we evaluated the involvement of specific epithelial-to-mesenchymaltransition- (EMT-) and immune-related pathways in the dissemination of luminal B BC cells. The expression of 42 EMT- and immune-related genes was evaluated inmatched sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) analyzed by the one-step nucleic acidamplification assay (OSNA) and primary tumors of 40 luminal B BC patients by genearray and immunohistochemistry. The results were validated in an independentgroup of 150 luminal B tumors by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence and using gene expression data from 315 luminal B BC patients included in theMetabric dataset. We found that the expression of CXCR4 (p = 3.28E - 02) andCD163 (p = 6.92E - 03) was significantly upregulated in SLNs of recurrent luminalB BC patients. Luminal B primary tumors overexpressing CXCR4 were characterizedby an increased expression of vimentin and a high content of CD163-positivemacrophages. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed the correlation of CXCR4 withCXCL12, VIM, and CD163 expression and LN involvement. Our results suggest thatthe upregulation of the CXCR4/CXCL12 pathway and the presence of protumormacrophages in the primary tumor and SLNs sustain the aggressiveness of animportant subgroup of luminal B BC.DOI: 10.1155/2018/5018671 PMCID: PMC5926522PMID: 29849822
