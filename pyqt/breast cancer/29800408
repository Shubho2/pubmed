This study assessed the effect of Choices, abilingual multi-component intervention, on perceived understanding of clinicaltrials, agreement with stages of decision readiness and consideration of clinicaltrials as a treatment option, among Latina breast cancer patients. Thisrandomized controlled pilot study compared Choices with a control conditionproviding general clinical trial information to eligible patients. Seventy-seven Latina breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to either Choices (n = 38)or the control (n = 39). Choices included three components: an educationalinteractive video, a low-literacy booklet, and care coordination by patientnavigation (i.e., educational and psychosocial support, coordinatingappointments, translating, interacting with the medical team). Choices was moreeffective than the control in improving perceived understanding of clinicaltrials (p = .033) and increasing consideration of clinical trials as a treatment option (p = .008). Additionally, intervention participants showed significantchanges between baseline and post-intervention on agreement with stages ofdecision readiness statements (p < .002) than control participants (p > .05); thepercentage of intervention women in agreement with preparation to actionstatements increased from 52.8% at baseline to 86.1% at post-intervention, andthose in agreement with ready to action stages rose from 50.0% to 88.9%.Computer-based videos and care coordination provided by patientnavigation-specifically tailored to Latinos-are effective strategies tosuccessfully address awareness, and improved decision-making skills to makeinformed decisions about clinical trial participation.DOI: 10.1093/tbm/ibx083 PMID: 29800408
