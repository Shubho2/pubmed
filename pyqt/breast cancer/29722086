Thus, in this study, apoptotic mechanism of LA was elucidated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Here, LA increased cytotoxicity in MCF-7 andMDA-MB-231 cells; enhanced sub-G1 population, G2/M arrest, and cleavedpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; activated phosphorylation of AMP-activated proteinkinase (AMPK)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase pathway; and also suppressed phosphorylationof AKT and the expression of forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), X-linked inhibitor ofapoptosis protein, B-cell lymphoma 2, and CyclinB1 in MDA-MB-231 cells.Furthermore, AMPK inhibitor compound C reversed the effect of LA on FOXM1, CyclinB1, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in MDA-MB-231 cells. Notably,immunoprecipitation revealed that LA disturbed the direct binding of AKT andFOXM1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall, these findings suggest that LA-inducedapoptosis is mediated via activation of AMPK and inhibition of AKT/FOXM1signaling pathway.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6105 PMID: 29722086
