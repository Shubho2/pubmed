[Epub ahead of print]Alcohol drinking, ADH1B and ADH1C genotypes, and the risk of postmenopausalbreast cancer by hormone receptor status: The Netherlands Cohort Study on Dietand Cancer.Hahn M(1)(2), Simons CCJM(1), Weijenberg MP(1), van den Brandt PA(1)(3).Author information: (1)Department of Epidemiology, GROW - School for Oncology and DevelopmentalBiology, Maastricht University, Maastricht, MD, The Netherlands.(2)Department of Anesthesiology, University Hospital Bern, Bern, Switzerland.(3)Department of Epidemiology, CAPHRI- School for Public Health and Primary Care,Maastricht University, Maastricht, MD, The Netherlands.Alcohol has consistently been shown to increase breast cancer (BC) risk. Thisassociation may be modified by single nucleotide polymorphisms in alcoholdehydrogenase isoenzymes ADH1B and ADH1C. The Netherlands Cohort Study comprises 62 573 women, aged 55-69 years at baseline (1986). Follow-up for postmenopausalBC for 20.3 years was available. Genotyping of 6 tag SNPs in ADH1B and ADH1C,respectively, was performed on DNA from toenails. A case-cohort approach was usedfor analysis (complete data available for: nsubcohort= 1301; ncases= 1630). Coxregression models for postmenopausal BC were applied to determine marginaleffects of alcohol intake and SNPs using a dominant genetic model, as well asmultiplicative interaction of the two. Results were also obtained for subtypes byestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. Multiple testing wasadjusted for by applying the false discovery rate (FDR). Alcohol intake(categorical) increased the risk of postmenopausal BC (ptrend=0.031). Trends for ER and PR subgroups followed a similar pattern. Continuous modelling of alcoholresulted in a hazard rate ratio (HR) for overall postmenopausal BC of 1.09 (95%CI: 1.01 - 1.19) per 10g/d of alcohol. SNPs were not associated with BC risk. No effect modification of the alcohol-BC association by SNP genotype was seen after FDR-correction in overall BC and ER/PR subgroups. In conclusion, alcohol wasshown to increase the risk of postmenopausal BC. This association was notsignificantly modified by common ADH1B and ADH1C SNPs, neither in overall BC nor in hormone receptor defined subtypes.DOI: 10.1093/carcin/bgy101 PMID: 30052783
