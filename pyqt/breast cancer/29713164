Chemotherapeutic drugs present several limitations such asundesired side effects, low specificity, resistance, and high relapse rates.Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is caused by cells that lack specificreceptors in their membrane, such as estrogen (ER+) and progesterone (PR+)receptors, or by cells that do not express the amplification of human epidermalgrowth factor receptor-2 (HER-2+). This cancer type has poor prognosis, highrelapse rates, and no targeted therapies. Thus, this study aimed to investigatethe trends of nanotechnology research in TNBC and compare the contribution ofresearch from different regions, institutions, and authors. A search of thestudies published between 2012 and 2017, related to nanotechnology and TNBC, withdifferent keyword combinations, was performed in the Scopus database. Thekeywords found in this search were grouped into four clusters, in which "breastcancer" was the most mentioned (1,133 times) and the word "MCF-7 cell line" isone of the latest hotspots that appeared in the year 2016. A total of 1,932articles, which were cited 26,450 times, were identified. The USA accounted for28.36% of the articles and 27.61% of the citations; however, none of its centers appeared in the list of 10 most productive ones in terms of publications. Thejournals Biomaterials and International Journal of Nanomedicine had the highestnumber of publications. The USA and China had the highest number of articlesproduced and cited; however, the highest average citation per article was fromSingapore. The studies focused on the research of antineoplastic agents in animalmodels and cell culture, and these were the most used topics in research withnanotechnology and TNBC.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S164355 PMCID: PMC5910795PMID: 29713164  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
