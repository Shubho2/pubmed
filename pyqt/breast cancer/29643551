The present study was carried out to assess the role ofdexmedetomidine in breast cancer surgery as a day-care procedure.Methods: This prospective randomised, double-blind study was carried out on 100patients screened for day-care breast cancer surgery. They were divided into two groups of 50 each; who received either normal saline (Group NS) or 0.6 μg/kg/hdexmedetomidine (Group D) infusion from 10 min before induction until skinclosure. All patients were given general anaesthesia. The incidence of discharge,post-operative pain (POP), average rescue analgesia (fentanyl) required and side effects were noted. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test andChi-square test.Results: Incidence of discharge in group NS was 60% compared to 88% in Group D (P= 0.001). Average rescue analgesia requirement by group NS was 136.07 ± 43.06 μg,whereas it was 77.5 ± 29.86 μg in Group D (P = 0.01). The incidence of POP in 6 hand within 2 h of expected discharge time in Group NS was 56% and 28%,respectively, and in Group D, it was 8% in both the periods (P < 0.001 and 0.01).Side effects such as post-operative nausea, vomiting and bleeding wereencountered in eight and two patients, respectively, in Group NS and two and one patients, respectively, in Group D.Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine as an anaesthetic adjuvant makes breast cancersurgery feasible on day-care basis.DOI: 10.4103/ija.IJA_752_17 PMCID: PMC5881319PMID: 29643551
