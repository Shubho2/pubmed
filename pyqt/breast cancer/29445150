Shifting tumor-promoting M2-like TAMs toward the M1-likephenotype, which exerts tumor suppressor functions via phagocytosis and thesecretion of inhibitory factors, may be a potential therapeutic strategy forliver cancer metastasis treatment.We first cloned NDRG2 (N-mycdownstream-regulated gene 2) and verified its tumor suppressor role in multiplesolid tumors, including colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its role in the tumor-associated liver microenvironment, especially in TAMs, has not been illustrated. By establishing a liver cancer metastasis model inwild-type (WT) and Ndrg2 knockout (Ndrg2-/-) mice, we found that the loss of the tumor suppressor Ndrg2 in liver microenvironment significantly suppressed thegrowth of liver colonies. In addition, this process was accompanied by a higherproportion of M1-like TAM infiltration in Ndrg2-/- mice. Interestingly, bonemarrow (BM) transplantation revealed that BM-derived macrophages (BMDMs) ratherthan liver resident Kupffer cells were responsible for the inhibitory effect. We further demonstrated that loss of Ndrg2 influenced TAM polarization via the NF-κBpathway. Inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation in cancer cell-conditionedmedium-stimulated BMDMs decreased M1 marker expression in Ndrg2-/- macrophages.Finally, in vitro, invasion, migration, and proliferation assays confirmed thatNF-κB participated in the tumor suppressor function of Ndrg2-/- macrophages.Collectively, our findings highlight the role of NDRG2 in the regulation of TAMpolarization and its function in promoting cancer liver metastasis.DOI: 10.1038/s41419-018-0284-8 PMCID: PMC5833557PMID: 29445150
