The aim of this paper was to highlight the rising burden of breast cancerwith an emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa as well as trends, characteristics,controversies and their implications for regional development.METHODOLOGY: A review of published studies and documents was conducted inMedline, Scopus, Pubmed and Google using combinations of key words-breastneoplasm, breast cancer, cancer, incidence, mortality, Africa, Nigeria. Graphicaland frequency analyses were carried out on some of the incidence and mortalityfigures retrieved from published papers and the GLOBOCAN website.FINDINGS: Globally, about 25% and 15% of all new cancer cases and cancer deathsrespectively among females were due to breast cancer. Africa currently had thehighest age-standardized breast cancer mortality rate globally, with the highest incidence rates being recorded within the sub-Saharan African sub-region.Incidence trends such as inherently aggressive tumour and younger age profile hadbeen subject to controversies. Certain factors such as westernized diet,urbanization and possibly increasing awareness had been implicated, though their specific contributions were yet to be fully established.CONCLUSION: Unless urgent action is taken, breast cancer will compoundsub-Saharan Africa's disease burden, increase poverty and gender inequality aswell as reverse the current global gains against maternal and neonatal mortality.DOI: 10.1186/s12957-018-1345-2 PMCID: PMC5863808PMID: 29566711
