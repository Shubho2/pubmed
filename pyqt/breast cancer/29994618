Causality inference in Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) is an important, yetchallenging task due to the limits of available data and lack of efficiency inexisting causality inference techniques. A number of techniques have beenproposed and applied to infer causal relationships in various domains, althoughthey are not specific to regulatory network inference. In this paper, we assessthe effectiveness of methods for inferring causal GRNs. We introduce sevendifferent inference methods and apply them to infer directed edges in GRNs. Weuse time-series expression data from the DREAM challenges to assess the methodsin terms of quality of inference and rank them based on performance. The bestmethod is applied to Breast Cancer data to infer a causal network. Experimentalresults show that Causation Entropy is best, however, highly time-consuming andnot feasible to use in a relatively large network. We infer Breast Cancer GRNwith the second-best method, TE. The topological analysis of the network reveals that top out-degree genes such as SLC39A5 which are considered central genes,play important role in cancer progression.DOI: 10.1109/TCBB.2018.2853728 PMID: 29994618
