The MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells were treated with hirsutine at different concentrations for 48 h orincubated with 160 μmol/L hirsutine for 24, 48, and 72 h. The MCF-10A cell lineis a non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line, and the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 are humanbreast adenocarcinoma cell lines. CCK-8 assay was employed to detect the cellviability. Flow cytometry was used to assay the apoptosis and mitochondrialmembrane potential (MMP). The protein expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved-caspase 9, cleaved-caspase 3 and cytochrome C (Cyt C) in the MDA-MB-231 cells weredetected by Western blotting. The results showed that hirsutine remarkablyreduced the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a time- and dose-dependentmanner (P < 0.05) with IC50 values of 447.79 and 179.06 μmol/L, respectively. In the MDA-MB-231 cells, hirsutine induced apoptosis and depolarization of MMP (P < 0.05), released Cyt C from mitochondria (P < 0.05), and activated caspase 9 andcaspase 3 (P < 0.05). However, these effects induced by hirsutine were allinhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA) (P < 0.05), a specific inhibitor ofmitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). In addition, hirsutinedown-regulated the protein level of Bcl-2 and up-regulated the protein level ofBax (P < 0.05). These results suggest that hirsutine may induce apoptosis ofhuman breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells through decreasing the ratio of Bcl-2 toBax, opening MPTP, releasing Cyt C from mitochondria, and activating caspase 9and caspase 3.PMID: 29492513
