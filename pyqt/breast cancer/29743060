Antiestrogens such as tamoxifen, a selectiveestrogen receptor (ER) modulator, are widely used in clinics to treat ER-positivebreast tumors. However, remissions of breast cancer are often followed byresistance to tamoxifen and disease relapse. Despite the increasing understandingof the resistance mechanisms, effective regimens for treating tamoxifen-resistantbreast cancer are limited. Antrodia cinnamomea is a traditional medicinalmushroom native only to Taiwan. In this study, we aimed to examine in vitroeffect of antrodia cinnamomea in the tamoxifen-resistant cancer.METHODS: Antrodia cinnamomea was studied for its biological activity againstproliferation of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer by XTT assay. Next, theunderlying mechanism was studied by flow cytometry, qPCR and Western's blottingassay.RESULTS: Our results revealed that the ethanol extract of antrodia cinnamomea(AC) can inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells, including MCF-7 cell andtamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cell lines. Combination treatment with AC and 10- 6 Mtamoxifen have the better inhibitory effect on the proliferation oftamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells than only AC did. AC can induce apoptosis inthese breast cancer cells. Moreover, it can suppress the mRNA expression of skp2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) by increasing the expressions of miR-21-5p,miR-26-5p, and miR-30-5p in MCF-7 and tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the ethanol extract of antrodiacinnamomea could be a novel anticancer agent in the armamentarium oftamoxifen-resistant breast cancer management. Moreover, we hope to identifyadditional pure compounds that could serve as promising anti-breast cancercandidates for further clinical trials.DOI: 10.1186/s12906-018-2204-y PMCID: PMC5944021PMID: 29743060  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
