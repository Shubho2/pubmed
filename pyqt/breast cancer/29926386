The present study analyzed genetic polymorphisms in CXCL12 (rs1801157,G > A) and CXCR4 (rs2228014, C > T) and CXCR4 immunostaining in tumor tissuesfrom patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) aiming to evaluate their possible role in its' susceptibility and prognosis. Genetic polymorphisms wereanalyzed in 59 TNBC patients and 150 control women; age-adjusted logisticregression showed no association when variants were considered in isolation;however, a statistically significant interaction was noted for heterozygosis for both allelic variants increasing the odds for TNBC (CXCL12-GA by CXCR4-CT: OR7.23; 95% CI 1.15-45.41; p = 0.035). CXCL12 polymorphism was correlatednegatively with proliferation index (Ki67) (Tau-b = - 0.406; p = 0.006). CXCR4immunostaining was evaluated in 37 TNBC patients (22 with paired tumor-normaladjacent tissue). CXCR4 was detected more intensely in cell cytoplasm than inmembrane, and was more expressed in tumor than in normal adjacent tissues,although not statistically significant. CXCR4 expression on the membrane of tumorcells was correlated positively with histopathological grade (Tau-b = 0.271;p = 0.036) and negatively with lymph node metastasis (Tau-b = - 0.478;p = 0.036). The present study indicates that CXCL12 and CXCR4 polymorphisms andCXCR4 immunostaining might have susceptibility and prognostic roles in TNBCpathogenesis.DOI: 10.1007/s11033-018-4215-7 PMID: 29926386
