Intraoperative identification of metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymphnodes may allow for concurrent axillary lymph node dissection at the time ofprimary tumor excision. A retrospective review of patients undergoing primarybreast cancer excision with sentinel lymph node sampling was performed.Sensitivity and specificity of imprint cytology (touch prep) with and without theincorporation of gross evaluation was determined using permanent section results as the gold standard. Five hundred sixteen lymph nodes were analyzed by imprintcytology in 213 patients, and 203 lymph nodes were analyzed in 74 patientsincorporating gross examination. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection ofmacrometastases by touch prep alone were 60% and 99% respectively with 4 patientsundergoing same-day axillary dissection for only micrometastatic disease. Falsenegative causes included lack of transfer of malignant cells in 8 cases andmisinterpretation of tumor cells in 6 cases. Incorporating gross examination inthe modified protocol resulted in reduced sensitivity of 38%, but achieved thedesired 100% specificity and positive predictive value. Imprint cytology alonedid not reliably distinguish between micro- and macrometastatic disease. Grossassessment combined with imprint cytology allows for improved assessment ofvolume of axillary disease, but is an insensitive technique.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.
