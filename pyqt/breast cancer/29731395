Electronicaddress: koffa@mskcc.org.CDK4/6 inhibitors are among a new generation of therapeutics. Building upon thestriking success of the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors and the hormone receptorantagonist letrozole in breast cancer, many other combinations have recentlyentered clinical trials in multiple diseases. To achieve maximal benefit withCDK4/6 inhibitors it will be critical to understand the cellular mechanisms bywhich they act. Here we highlight the mechanisms by which CDK4/6 inhibitors canexert their anti-tumor activities beyond simply enforcing cytostatic growtharrest, and discuss how this knowledge may inform new combinations, improveoutcomes, and modify dosing schedules in the future.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
