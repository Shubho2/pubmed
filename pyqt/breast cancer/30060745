Pre-clinical studies suggest VD enhanceschemotherapy-induced cell death. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with notattaining a pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy(NAC) for operable breast cancer. We report the impact of VD on pCR and survival in an expanded cohort.METHODS: Patients from Iowa and Montpellier registries who had serum VD levelmeasured before or during NAC were included. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as < 20 ng/mL. Pathological complete response was defined as no residual invasivedisease in the breast and lymph nodes. Survival was defined from the date ofdiagnosis to the date of relapse (PFS) or date of death (OS).RESULTS: The study included 327 women. Vitamin D deficiency was associated withthe odds of not attaining pCR (p = 0.04). Fifty-four patients relapsed and 52patients died. In multivariate analysis, stage III disease, triple-negative (TN) subtype and the inability to achieve pCR were independently associated withinferior survival. Vitamin D deficiency was not significantly associated withsurvival in the overall sample; however a trend was seen in the TN (5-years PFS60.4% vs. 72.3%, p = 0.3), and in the hormone receptor positive /human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) subgroups (5-years PFS 89% vs 78%,p = 0.056).CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with the inability to reach pCR inbreast cancer patients undergoing NAC.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4686-x PMCID: PMC6066931PMID: 30060745
