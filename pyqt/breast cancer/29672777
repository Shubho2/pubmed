Some patients require additionalboost radiation to the internal mammary nodes as the part of regional nodalirradiation (RNI). Delayed breast reconstruction with an autologous free flapusing the internal mammary vessels for microvascular flap anastomosis is a commonpractice for these patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect ofRNI on autologous microvascular breast reconstruction.PATIENTS AND METHODS:  A retrospective study was performed on 57 patients (69flaps) undergoing deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap for delayedbreast reconstruction after radiation therapy. The study group included 37patients (65%) who received PMRT and RNI to the internal mammary nodes. Thecontrol group included 20 patients (35%) who received PMRT alone. Early anddelayed surgical complications, including wound complications, fat necrosis, and flap loss, were compared between the groups.RESULTS:  The patient demographics in both groups were similar. Complication rateshowed a higher trend in the study group for flap loss (8.3% versus 0%) andvascular anastomosis failure (5.6% versus 0%), but with no statistical difference(p = 0.54, 0.53, respectively). The control group showed a higher trend in fatnecrosis (25% versus 8.3%, p = 0.11).CONCLUSIONS:  DIEP flap breast reconstructions with internal mammary vesselsanastomosis should be performed with cautious in patients who had received RNI tointernal mammary nodes because of potential added risk for surgicalcomplications.Thieme Medical Publishers 333 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA.DOI: 10.1055/s-0038-1625986 PMID: 29672777
