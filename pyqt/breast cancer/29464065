Herewe systematically investigated the expression of PD-1 on tumor infiltratinglymphocytes and PD-L1 on both tumor and infiltrated immune cells. Moreover, thePD-L1 gene status in tumor cells was assessed. 103 tissue microarray samplesderived from triple negative breast cancer specimens were immunohistochemicallystained against PD-1 and PD-L1. Dual marker fluorescence in-situ hybridizationwas applied to the PD-L1 gene and centromere region of chromosome 9. The disease free and overall survival rates were determined as a function of the PD-1/PD-L1status. A slight gain of the PD-L1 gene region was found in 55% of all samplesbut an elevated PD-L1/cen9 ratio was rather rare (7%). An increased gene dose is not associated with an enhanced protein expression and the PD-L1 expression only weakly correlates with the amount of immune cell infiltration. Instead, we found an association of PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells, respectively.Notably, the PD-1 expression on immune cells is associated with a favorabledisease free and overall survival. PD-1 expression indicates an enhancedimmunological anti-tumor activity and represents a favorable prognostic impact. Adeeper understanding of factors that affect the regulation and function of thePD-1/PD-L1 system is required to establish predictive variables and to utilizethe system for therapeutic intervention of triple negative breast cancerpatients.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23717 PMCID: PMC5814205PMID: 29464065
