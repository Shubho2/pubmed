In ourstudy, we used in vivo magnetic resonance imaging analysis to investigate theinfluence of radiotherapy-induced damage of healthy brain on the arrest andgrowth of metastatic breast cancer cells in a mouse model of breast cancer brain metastasis. We observed that irradiated, but otherwise healthy, neural tissue hadan increased propensity to support metastatic growth compared withnever-irradiated controls. The elucidation of the impact of irradiation on normalneural tissue could have implications in clinical patient management,particularly in patients with residual systemic disease or with residualradio-resistant brain cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/nbm.3907 PMID: 29493009
