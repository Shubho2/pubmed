This retrospective studyaimed to evaluate the relationship between glycaemic control and BC prognosis andto determine an optimal target of glycaemic control for BC patients withdiabetes. We included 2812 stage 0-3 BC women, of whom 145 were diabetic and were2667 non-diabetic. In those with diabetes, a mean haemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) < 7%(n = 77) was defined as well-controlled diabetes, while a mean HbA1C > 9%(n = 16) was defined as poorly controlled diabetes. All of the BC populationswere followed from the date on which BC was diagnosed until 31 December 2015. Coxregression analysis was performed to estimate the adjusted hazards for all-cause mortality and BC-specific mortality. After controlling for the baseline andBC-related confounders, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortalityand the HR for BC-specific mortality were 3.65 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.13-11.82) and 8.37 (95% CI 1.90-36.91), respectively, for poorly controlleddiabetic women and non-DM women. However, for the diabetic women with goodglycaemic control, the HRs of all-cause mortality and BC-specific mortality were not significantly different (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.42-1.01; HR 0.77, 95% CI0.18-3.32, respectively) from those for both mortalities in non-DM patients. For moderate controlled diabetic women, the HRs for all-cause mortality andBC-specific mortality were 1.95 (95% CI 0.89-4.27) and 3.55 (95% CI 1.369-9.30), respectively. This pilot and retrospective cohort study reveals a relationshipbetween glycaemic control and BC prognosis in diabetic women. In addition,well-controlled HbA1C, with maintained mean HbA1C values under 7%, may beassociated with a better progression outcome of BC.DOI: 10.1007/s10238-018-0497-2 PMID: 29572669
