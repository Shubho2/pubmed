We investigated time todiagnosis and treatment for rural and urban patients with colorectal or breastcancer in Victoria, Australia.METHODS: Population-based surveys (2013-2014) of patients (aged ≥40, approachedwithin six months of diagnosis), primary care physicians (PCP), and specialistswere collected as part of the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership,Module 4. Six intervals were examined: patient (symptom to presentation), primarycare (presentation to referral), diagnostic (presentation/screening todiagnosis), treatment (diagnosis to treatment), health system (presentation totreatment) and total interval (symptom/screening to treatment). Rural and urbanintervals were compared using quantile regression including age, sex, insuranceand socio-economic status.RESULTS: 433 colorectal (48% rural) and 489 breast (42% rural) patients, 621 PCPsand 370 specialists participated. Compared to urban patients, symptomaticcolorectal cancer patients from rural areas had significantly longer totalintervals at the 50th (18 days longer, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 9-27), 75th (53, 95% CI: 47-59) and 90th percentiles (44, 95% CI: 40-48). These patients alsohad longer diagnostic and health system intervals (6-85 days longer). Breastcancer intervals were similar by area of residence, except the patient interval, which was shorter for rural patients with either cancer in the higherpercentiles.CONCLUSIONS: Rural residence was associated with longer total intervals forcolorectal but not breast cancer; with most disparities post-presentation.IMPACT: Interventions targeting time from presentation to diagnosis may helpreduce colorectal cancer rural-urban disparities.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0210 PMID: 29987098
