An important risk factor for breast cancer isindividual genetic background, which is initially generated early in human life, for example, during the processes of embryogenesis and fetal development in uteroBioactive dietary components such as sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate fromcruciferous vegetables including broccoli sprouts (BSp), cabbage, and kale, hasbeen shown to reduce the risk of developing many common cancers throughregulation of epigenetic mechanisms. Our study indicates a prenatal/maternal BSp dietary treatment exhibited maximal preventive effects in inhibiting breastcancer development compared with postnatal early-life and adult BSp treatments intwo transgenic mouse models that can develop breast cancer. Postnatal early-life BSp treatment starting prior to puberty onset showed protective effects inprevention of breast cancer but was not as effective as the prenatal/maternal BSptreatment. However, adulthood-administered BSp diet did not reduce mammarytumorigenesis. Our results suggest that the prenatal/maternal BSp bioactivenatural plant product may impact early embryonic development by regulating globaldifferential gene expression through affecting epigenetic profiles resulting indifferential susceptibility to breast cancer later in life. These results suggestthat a temporal exposure to epigenetic-modulating dietary components such ascruciferous vegetables could be a key factor for maximizing chemopreventiveeffects on human breast cancer. This study may lead to translational breastcancer chemopreventive potential by appropriate administration of key dietarycomponents leading to early breast cancer prevention in humans.
