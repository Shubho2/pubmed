QOL was assessed by the FACIT-measurement system.RESULTS: The chemotherapy-induced reduction of QOL was less than the MinimallyImportant Difference (MID; FACT-G = 5) with STF but greater than the MID fornon-fasted periods. The mean chemotherapy-induced deterioration of total FACIT-F was 10.4 ± 5.3 for fasted and 27.0 ± 6.3 for non-fasted cycles in group A and14.1 ± 5.6 for non-fasted and 11.0 ± 5.6 for fasted cycles in group B. There wereno serious adverse effects.CONCLUSION: STF during chemotherapy is well tolerated and appears to improve QOL and fatigue during chemotherapy. Larger studies should prove the effect of STF asan adjunct to chemotherapy.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01954836 .DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4353-2 PMCID: PMC5921787PMID: 29699509
