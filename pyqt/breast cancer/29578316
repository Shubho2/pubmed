Mullick Road, Jadavpur, Kolkata-, 700032,West Bengal, India.A series of primary ammonium monocarboxylate (PAM) salts derived from β-alaninederivatives of pyrene and naphthalene acetic acid, along with the parent acids,were explored to probe the plausible role of orthogonal hydrogen bondingresulting from amide⋅⋅⋅amide and PAM synthons on gelation. Single-crystal X-raydiffraction (SXRD) studies were performed on two parent acids and five PAM salts in the series. The data revealed that orthogonal hydrogen bonding played animportant role in gelation. Structure-property correlation based on SXRD andpowder X-ray diffraction data also supported the working hypothesis upon whichthese gelators were designed.3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and cellmigration assay on a highly aggressive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231,revealed that one of the PAM salts in the series, namely, PAA.B2, displayedanticancer properties, and internalization of the gelator salt in the same cellline was confirmed by cell imaging.© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
