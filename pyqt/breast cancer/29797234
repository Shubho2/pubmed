In this study, we researched the inhibitory effect of ARTon MCF7 cells and explored the possible mechanisms.METHODS: MTT assay was used to detect the effect of ART on the proliferation ofMCF7 cells. Crystal violet staining was used to observe morphological andquantitative changes. Flow cytometry was used to detect the cell cycle of thedrug-acting MCF7 cells. In addition, western blotting was used to detect the druginfluence on expression of the ATM, phospho-ATM(S1981), H2AX, γH2AX(S139), CHK2and phospho-CHK2(T68), cdc25C, and phospho-cdc25C(S216).RESULTS: In the experimental groups, the proliferation of MCF7 cells wasinhibited in a dose-dependent manner and the original cell morphology was lost.The number of G2/M phase cells in the experimental groups increasedsignificantly, and the expression of DNA damage response-associated proteins was significantly increased, such as phospho-ATM(S1981), γH2AX(S139),phospho-CHK2(T68), and phospho-cdc25C(S216).CONCLUSIONS: ART can inhibit cell proliferation and promote G2/M arrest in MCF7cells through ATM activation and the ensuing "ATM-Chk2-Cdc25C" pathway, thusimplicating ART as a novel candidate for breast cancer chemotherapy.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0873-5 PMID: 29797234
