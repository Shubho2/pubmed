Accordingly, TNBCs do notrespond to hormonal therapies or medicines targeting the ER, PR, or HER2.Systemic chemotherapy is therefore the only treatment option available today and prognoses remain poor. We report the discovery and characterization ofN-(naphtho[1,2-b]furan-5-yl)benzenesulfonamides as selective inhibitors of TNBCs.These inhibitors were identified by virtual screening and inhibited differentTNBC cell lines with IC50 values of 2-3 Î¼M. The compounds did not inhibit normal (i.e. MCF-7 and MCF-10A) cells in vitro, indicating their selectivity againstTNBC cells. Considering the selectivity of these inhibitors for TNBC, thesecompounds and analogs can serve as a promising starting point for furtherresearch on effective TNBC inhibitors.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23030678 PMID: 29547591
