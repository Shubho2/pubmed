We report on the experience ofsingle institution with cardiac-sparing radiotherapy using voluntary deepinspiration breath hold (V-DIBH) and compare its dosimetric outcome with freebreathing (FB) technique.Patients and methods: Left-sided breast cancer patients, treated at ourdepartment with postoperative radiotherapy of breast/chest wall +/- regionallymph nodes between May 2015 and January 2017, were considered for inclusion.FB-computed tomography (CT) was obtained and dose-planning performed. Cases with cardiac V25Gy ≥ 5% or risk factors for heart disease were coached for V-DIBH.Compliant patients were included. They underwent additional CT in V-DIBH forplanning, followed by V-DIBH radiotherapy. Dose volume histogram parameters forheart, lung and optimized planning target volume (OPTV) were compared between FB and BH. Treatment setup shifts and systematic and random errors for V-DIBHtechnique were compared with FB historic control.Results: Sixty-three patients were considered for V-DIBH. Nine (14.3%) werenon-compliant at coaching, leaving 54 cases for analysis. When compared with FB, V-DIBH resulted in a significant reduction of mean cardiac dose from 6.1 +/- 2.5 to 3.2 +/- 1.4 Gy (p < 0.001), maximum cardiac dose from 51.1 +/- 1.4 to 48.5 +/-6.8 Gy (p = 0.005) and cardiac V25Gy from 8.5 +/- 4.2 to 3.2 +/- 2.5% (p <0.001). Heart volumes receiving low (10-20 Gy) and high (30-50 Gy) doses werealso significantly reduced. Mean dose to the left anterior coronary artery was23.0 (+/- 6.7) Gy and 14.8 (+/- 7.6) Gy on FB and V-DIBH, respectively (p <0.001). Differences between FB- and V-DIBH-derived mean lung dose (11.3 +/- 3.2vs. 10.6 +/- 2.6 Gy), lung V20Gy (20.5 +/- 7 vs. 19.5 +/- 5.1 Gy) and V95% forthe OPTV (95.6 +/- 4.1 vs. 95.2 +/- 6.3%) were non-significant. V-DIBH-derivedmean shifts for initial patient setup were ≤ 2.7 mm. Random and systematic errorswere ≤ 2.1 mm. These results did not differ significantly from historic FBcontrols.Conclusions: When compared with FB, V-DIBH demonstrated high setup accuracy andenabled significant reduction of cardiac doses without compromising the targetvolume coverage. Differences in lung doses were non-significant.DOI: 10.1515/raon-2018-0008 PMCID: PMC5839089PMID: 29520213
