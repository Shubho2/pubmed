However, the incidence ofincisional hernia and its risk factors are not well known. The purpose of ourstudy was to investigate risk factors for incisional hernia after laparoscopiccolorectal cancer surgery.METHODS: The study group consisted of 212 patients who underwent laparoscopiccolorectal cancer surgery at Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital between November 2008and October 2013. Diagnosis of incisional hernia was performed by postoperativeCT. The visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area at the level of theumbilicus were calculated using an image analysis system. For statisticalanalysis, Fisher's exact test or Student's t-test were used for univariateanalysis, and logistic regression analysis was used for multivariate analysis.The cut-off value for risk factors was calculated from the receiver-operatorcurve.RESULTS: Incisional hernia was observed in 18 patients (8.5%). On univariateanalysis, female sex (P = 0.04), older age (P = 0.02), subcutaneous fat area (P< 0.01), VFA (P = 0.02), and BMI >25 kg/m2 (P < 0.01) were significant riskfactors for incisional hernia. The predictive cut-off values were as follows:age, 72 years; subcutaneous fat area, 110 cm2 ; VFA, 110 cm2 ; and albuminconcentration, 3.9 g/dL. On multivariate analysis, a VFA >110 cm2 (P < 0.01) and female sex (P = 0.01) were retained as independent risk factors for incisionalhernia.CONCLUSION: After laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery, a higher VFA and femalesex are independent risk factors for incisional hernia.© 2018 Japan Society for Endoscopic Surgery, Asia Endosurgery Task Force and JohnWiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.DOI: 10.1111/ases.12466 PMID: 29457355
