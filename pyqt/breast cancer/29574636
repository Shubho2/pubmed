Although several GPCRs can cross-talk with thehuman epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs), the expression and function ofmost GPCRs remain unknown in HER2+ breast cancer (BC). In this study, we aimed toevaluate gene expression of GPCRs in tumorigenic or anti-HER2 drug-resistantcells and to understand the potential role of candidate GPCRs in HER2+ BC.METHODS: Gene expression of 352 GPCRs was profiled in Aldeflur+ tumorigenicversus Aldeflur- population and anti-HER2 therapy-resistant derivatives versusparental cells of HER2+ BT474 cells. The GPCR candidates were confirmed in 7additional HER2+ BC cell line models and publicly available patient dataset.Anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent cell growth, mammosphere formation,and migration/invasion were evaluated upon GPR110 knockdown by siRNA in BT474 andSKBR3 parental and lapatinib+ trastuzumab-resistant (LTR) cells.RESULTS: Adhesion and class A GPCRs were overexpressed in Aldeflur+ and anti-HER2therapy-resistant population of BT474 cells, respectively. GPR110 was the onlyGPCR overexpressed in Aldeflur+ and anti-HER2 therapy-resistant population inBT474, SKBR3, HCC1569, MDA-MB-361, AU565, and/or HCC202 cells and in HER2+ BCsubtype in patient tumors. Using BT474 and SKBR3 parental and LTR cells, we foundthat GPR110 knockdown significantly reduced anchorage-dependent/independent cell growth as well as migration/invasion of parental and LTR cells and mammosphereformation in LTR derivatives and not in parental cells.CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a potential role of GPR110 in tumorigenicity and in tumor cell dissemination in HER2+ BC.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4751-9 PMID: 29574636
