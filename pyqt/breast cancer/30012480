Anticancer properties of these metabolites are widely exploited as potential chemotherapeutic agents. The present studyreports the purification and isolation of a potential antiproliferativeconstituent, stigmast-5-en-3-ol from the 70% ethanol extract of the soft coralDendronephthya gigantea. Among several other 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-steroidal congeners,stigmast-5-en-3-ol indicated prominent antiproliferative effects on HL-60(leukemia) and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines with IC50 values of 37.82 and45.17 μg/ml respectively. Stigmast-5-en-3-ol increased apoptotic body formation, accumulation of sub G1 apoptotic cells, and DNA damage in HL-60 and MCF-7 cells. It increased the expression of Bax, caspases, and PARP cleavage while decreasing Bcl-xL levels in both cancer cell lines indicating that the effects arearbitrated via the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Steroidal derivativeswere identified by GC MS/MS and the identity of stigmast-5-en-3-ol was confirmed by NMR spectra. The present study suggests that stigmast-5-en-3-ol could be apromising candidate for anticancer drug research.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
