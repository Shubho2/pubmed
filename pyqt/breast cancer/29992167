However, there is a population ofpatients who cannot undergo the standard surgical procedures due to severalreasons such as age, performance status, or comorbidity. Our aim was toinvestigate the feasibility and safety of percutaneous US-guided laser ablationfor unresectable unifocal breast cancer (BC).Methods: Between December 2012 and March 2017, 12 consecutive patients underwent percutaneous US-guided laser ablation as radical treatment of primary inoperable unifocal BC.Results: At median follow-up of 28.5 months (range 6-51), no residual disease or progression occurred; the overall success rate for complete tumor ablation wastherefore 100%. No significant operative side effects were observed, with only 2 (13.3%) experiencing slight to mild pain during the procedure, and all patientscomplained of a mild dull aching pain in the first week after procedure.Conclusions: Laser ablation promises to be a safe and feasible approach in those patients who are not eligible to the standard surgical approach. However, longer follow-up results and larger studies are strongly needed.DOI: 10.1155/2018/9141746 PMCID: PMC6016148PMID: 29992167
