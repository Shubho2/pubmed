We previously showed that trastuzumab and chemotherapyinduce HER2-specific antibodies which correlate with improved survival in HER2metastatic breast cancer patients. It remains unclear whether the generation ofimmunity required trastuzumab and whether endogenous antibody immunity isassociated with improved disease-free survival in the adjuvant setting. In thisstudy, we addressed this question by analyzing serum anti-HER2 antibodies from a subset of patients enrolled in the NCCTG trial N9831, which includes an arm (Arm A) in which trastuzumab was not used. Arms B and C received trastuzumabsequentially or concurrently to chemotherapy, respectively.METHODS: Pre-and post-treatment initiation sera were obtained from 50 womenenrolled in N9831. Lambda IgG antibodies (to avoid detection of trastuzumab) toHER2 were measured and compared between arms and with disease-free survival.RESULTS: Prior to therapy, across all three arms, N9831 patients had similar meananti-HER2 IgG levels. Following treatment, the mean levels of antibodiesincreased in the trastuzumab arms but not the chemotherapy-only arm. Theproportion of patients who demonstrated antibodies increased by 4% in Arm A andby 43% in the Arms B and C combined (p = 0.003). Cox modeling demonstrated thatlarger increases in antibodies were associated with improved disease-freesurvival in all patients (HR = 0.23; p = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the increased endogenous antibody immunityobserved in adjuvant patients treated with combination trastuzumab andchemotherapy is clinically significant, in view of its correlation with improved disease-free survival. The findings may have important implications forpredicting treatment outcomes in patients treated with trastuzumab in theadjuvant setting.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00005970 .
