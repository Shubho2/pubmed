Dermatomyositis is rarely the first presentation. We present a case ofa 63-year-old woman who had generalised dermatitis, progressive fatigue andmuscle weakness. She was first diagnosed as dermatomyositis and subsequentlybreast cancer. Her rash and muscle weakness progressed drastically over a month. Tumescent mastectomy and axillary surgery was performed, which led to gradualregression of her dermatomyositis over six months. This case report emphasized inthe benefit of early diagnosis and treatment of dermatomyositis and breastcancer. Pros and cons of tumescent mastectomy is discussed as well.PMID: 29531202
