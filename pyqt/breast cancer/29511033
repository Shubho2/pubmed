In this study, we examined the peripheralnerve penetration in rats of 11 small-molecule drugs possessing diversephysicochemical and transport properties and ProTx-II, a tarantula venom peptide with molecular mass of 3826 Daltons. Each drug was administered as constant rate intravenous infusion for 6 hours (small molecules) or 24 hours (ProTx-II). Blood and tissues including brain, spinal cord, sciatic nerve, and dorsal root ganglion(DRG) were collected for drug concentration measurements. Unbound fractions of a set of compounds were determined by equilibrium dialysis method in rat blood,brains, spinal cords, sciatic nerves, and DRG. We also investigated the influenceofN-[4-[2-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydro-1H-isoquinolin-2-yl)ethyl]phenyl]-5-methoxy-9-oxo-10H-acridine-4-carboxamide (GF120918), a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breastcancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor, on the peripheral nerve and centralnervous system (CNS) tissue penetration of imatinib. We found that: 1) theunbound fraction in brain tissue homogenate highly correlates with that in thespinal cord, sciatic nerve, and DRG for a set of compounds and thus provides agood surrogate for spinal cord and peripheral nerve tissues, 2) small-moleculedrugs investigated can penetrate the DRG and sciatic nerve, 3) P-gp and BCRP havea limited impact on the distribution of small-molecule drugs into peripheralnerves, and 4) DRG is permeable to ProTx-II, but its distribution into sciaticnerve and CNS tissues is restricted. These results demonstrate thatsmall-molecule drugs investigated can penetrate peripheral nerve tissues, andP-gp/BCRP may not be a limiting factor at the BNB. Biologics as large as ProTx-IIcan access the DRG but not sciatic nerve and CNS tissues.Copyright Â© 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/jpet.117.245613 PMID: 29511033
