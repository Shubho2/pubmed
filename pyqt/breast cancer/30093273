The goal of this study was to assess surgeon variation in the numberof sentinel lymph nodes removed and the oncologic yield of sentinel lymph nodebiopsy for breast cancer.METHODS: All patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicaredatabase who underwent operative treatment for breast cancer from 2007-2011 were eligible for inclusion. Deidentified provider codes were used to track operationsperformed by individual surgeons. Only records in which an individual surgeoncould be linked to a specific breast cancer operation were analyzed. The totalnumber of sentinel lymph nodes removed and the number that were pathologicallypositive (oncologic yield) were recorded. Surgeon variation by T stage wasanalyzed using linear mixed-effects regression and logistic mixed-effectsregression models.RESULTS: Query of the database identified 15,571 patients who met inclusioncriteria, representing 2,478 providers. The mean number of sentinel lymph nodeprocedures performed per provider per year was 1.3 (range 1-103). The lowestquartile of providers performed 1 or fewer sentinel lymph node procedures peryear. The highest quartile of providers performed >8 sentinel lymph nodeprocedures per year. The average number of sentinel lymph node removed peroperation increased with increasing T stage for all providers (P < .001),including when N0 (P < .001) and node-positive (P = .003) patients were evaluatedseparately. There was surgeon-associated variation in the number of sentinellymph node removed for each T stage (P < .001). In addition, there wassurgeon-associated variation in the oncologic yield (sentinel lymph nodepositivity rate) by T stage (P < .001).CONCLUSION: This study found surgeon-associated variation in axillary sentinellymph node staging of breast cancer patients, which suggests the need to improve standardization of surgical practices to optimize the oncologic yield of theseprocedures and ensure accurate staging.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
