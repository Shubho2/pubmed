Included patients had lymphoma, ovarian cancer,or breast cancer. The primary outcome was the proportion of women who retainedovarian function after chemotherapy. Extracted data points included study design,patient characteristics, and proportion of women who developed premature ovarian failure (POF). A risk of bias assessment was performed according to the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Thepooled odds ratio was calculated, and outcomes of individual studies werecompared using the random-effects model with the inverse-variance method and the DerSimonian-Laird estimator.RESULTS: Twenty-nine RCTs were identified, and 10 met criteria for inclusion inthe meta-analysis. An analysis of patients who did not develop POF afterchemotherapy revealed eight studies supporting the use of GnRHa (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.34-2.49). The duration of benefit of GnRHa is unclear. An analysis of threestudies with outcome data at 2Â years revealed a non-significant OR of 0.53 (95%CI 0.22-1.30) for the preservation of ovarian function with GnRHa treatment.CONCLUSION: GnRHa may have a protective effect against the development of POFafter gonadotoxic chemotherapy; however, the duration of benefit is unclear andrequires further study.DOI: 10.1007/s10815-018-1128-2 PMCID: PMC5949114 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29470701
