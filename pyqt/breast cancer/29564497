The objective of this study wasto develop a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model of EP and four of itsmetabolites (irinotecan, SN38, SN38-glucuronide, and APC) and determinecovariates affecting their pharmacokinetics.METHODS: Data from 83 cancer patients enrolled in phase 1 studies were used. The model was developed in two stages: (1) concentration-time data were analyzed witha 3-analyte model for EP, irinotecan, and SN38; and (2) a 5-analyte modeldeveloped based on expansion of 3-analyte model to include concentration-timedata for SN38 glucuronide and APC with parameter values from 3-analyte modelfixed. Covariate relationships with parameters were selected based on Wald's testwithin the Wald's Approximation Method approach, first for the 3-analyte modelthen the 5-analyte model.RESULTS: The final integrated popPK model for the five analytes was atwo-compartment per analyte model that followed the metabolic cascade of EP toirinotecan, followed by metabolism of irinotecan to the previously knownmetabolites, but with altered exposures as compared to administration ofirinotecan. With the model developed based on total dose of EP, the populationestimates of EP clearance and central volume were 0.237 L/h and 5.5 L,respectively. Patient age, body surface area (BSA), and estimated glomerularfiltration rate were found to correlate with EP clearance and BSA with EP centralvolume. Individuals who were homozygous for UGT1A1*28 genotype had modestlyreduced elimination capacity of SN38 compared to heterozygous and wild-typegenotypes. Simulations evaluating the clinical importance of significantcovariates indicated minimal change in areas under the curve and peakconcentrations of EP and SN38.CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of EP and four metabolites including the activemetabolite SN38 were described by an integrated popPK model. Other than BSA,which was already accounted by a BSA-based dosing scheme, no other covariateswere deemed to have clinical implications. No EP starting dose adjustment basedon patient demographics and other covariates was deemed necessary.DOI: 10.1007/s00280-018-3562-3 PMCID: PMC5907632PMID: 29564497
