This receptor plays animportant role in calcium homeostasis, and has also been detected in severaltissues that are unrelated to calcium metabolism, such as the skin, brain, andbreast. The calcium-sensing receptor on cellular level, it regulates celldifferentiation, proliferation, cell death, and gene expression. In breast cancercells, CaSR seems to stimulate secretion of the parathyroid hormone-relatedprotein (PTHrP), which stimulates cellular proliferation. Likewise, some studies have supported not only an association between calcium receptor gene polymorphismand breast cancer risk, but also a higher aggressiveness and unfavorable outcomesin breast cancer, which led us to make a survey in Pubmed on the subject in thelast 10 years. Thus, in the literature there is a paucity of studies on thesubject and the aim of this review was to show the role of calcium-sensingreceptor and its association with breast cancer risk.DOI: 10.1080/07357907.2018.1430817 PMID: 29504802  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
