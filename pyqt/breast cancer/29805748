Previously, metastasis was increasedwhen fulminant fibrosis was first induced in mice, suggesting a direct connectionbetween these processes. The current report examined the extent ofmetastasis-induced fibrosis in breast cancer model systems, and tested themetastasis preventive efficacy and fibrosis attenuation of antagonists for LPAR1 and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) in breast and ovarian cancer models.Staining analysis demonstrated only focal, low-moderate levels of fibrosis inlungs from eleven metastasis model systems. Two orally available LPAR1antagonists, SAR100842 and EPGN9878, significantly inhibited breast cancermotility to LPA in vitro. Both compounds were negative for metastasis prevention and failed to reduce fibrosis in the experimental MDA-MB-231T and spontaneousmurine 4T1 in vivo breast cancer metastasis models. SAR100842 demonstrated onlyoccasional reductions in invasive metastases in the SKOV3 and OVCAR5 ovariancancer experimental metastasis models. Two approved drugs for IPF, nintedanib andpirfenidone, were investigated. Both were ineffective at preventing MDA-MB-231Tmetastasis, with no attenuation of fibrosis. In summary, metastasis-inducedfibrosis is only a minor component of metastasis in untreated progressive breast cancer. LPAR1 antagonists, despite in vitro evidence of specificity and efficacy,were ineffective in vivo as oral agents, as were approved IPF drugs. The dataargue against LPAR1 and fibrosis as monotherapy targets for metastasis preventionin triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25231 PMCID: PMC5955109PMID: 29805748
