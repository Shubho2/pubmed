Developing efficient strategies to reverse MDRremains a major challenge. Surfactin (SUR), a cyclic lipopeptide biosurfactant,has been found to display anticancer activity.Methods: In this paper, SUR was assembled by solvent-emulsion method to load the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The cytotoxicity of DOX-loaded SURnanoparticles (DOX@SUR) against DOX-resistant human breast cancer MCF-7/ADR ismeasured by MTT assay. The cellular uptake and intracellular retention of DOX@SURare determined by flow cytometry. The tumor accumulation and anticancer activity of DOX@SUR are evaluated in MCF-7/ADR-bearing nude mice.Results: DOX@SUR induce stronger cytotoxicity against DOX-resistant human breast cancer MCF-7/ADR cells compared to free DOX. DOX@SUR nanoparticles exhibitenhanced cellular uptake and decreased cellular efflux, which might be associatedwith reduced P-glycoprotein expression. After internalization into MCF-7/ADRcells by macropinocytosis- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, DOX@SURnanoparticles are colocalized with the lysosomes and translocated to the nucleus to exert cytotoxicity. Furthermore, in vivo animal experiment shows that the DOX@SUR nanoparticles are accumulated more efficiently in tumors than free DOX.Meanwhile, DOX@SUR nanoparticles display stronger tumor inhibition activity andfewer side effects in MCF-7/ADR-bearing nude mice.Conclusion: This study indicates that SUR-based nanocarrier might present apromising platform to reverse MDR in cancer chemotherapy.DOI: 10.2147/IJN.S157368 PMCID: PMC5868599PMID: 29606866  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
