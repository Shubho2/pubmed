The aim of the present study was to estimatequantitatively the influence of c.421C>A on intestinal and hepatic BCRP activity using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of rosuvastatindeveloped from clinical data and several in vitro studies. Simultaneous fittingof clinical data for orally and intravenously administered rosuvastatin, obtainedin human subjects without genotype information, was first performed with the PBPKmodel to estimate intrinsic clearance for hepatic elementary process. Thefraction of BCRP activity in 421CA and 421AA (fca and faa values, respectively)with respect to that in 421CC subjects was then estimated based on extendedclearance concepts and simultaneous fitting to oral administration data for thethree genotypes (421CC, 421CA, and 421AA). On the assumption that c.421C>Aaffects both intestinal and hepatic BCRP, clinical data in each genotype werewell reproduced by the model, and the estimated terminal half-life was compatiblewith the observed values. The assumption that c.421C>A affects only eitherintestinal or hepatic BCRP gave poorer agreement with observed values. The faavalues obtained on the former assumption were 0.48-0.54. Thus, PBPK modelanalysis enabled quantitative evaluation of alteration in BCRP activity owing to c.421C>A, and BCRP activity in 421AA was estimated as half that in 421CC.Copyright Â© 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and ExperimentalTherapeutics.DOI: 10.1124/dmd.117.078816 PMID: 29440178
