Here, we explored the association of age at TNBC diagnosiswith the prevalence of pathogenic gBRCA mutations in this patient group.METHODS: The study comprised 802 women (median age 40 years, range 19-76) withoestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factorreceptor type 2 negative breast cancers, who had no relatives with breast orovarian cancer. All women were tested for pathogenic gBRCA mutations. Logisticregression analysis was used to explore the association between age at TNBCdiagnosis and the presence of a pathogenic gBRCA mutation.RESULTS: A total of 127 women with TNBC (15.8%) were gBRCA mutation carriers(BRCA1: n = 118, 14.7%; BRCA2: n = 9, 1.1%). The mutation prevalence was 32.9% inthe age group 20-29 years compared to 6.9% in the age group 60-69 years. Logisticregression analysis revealed a significant increase of mutation frequency withdecreasing age at diagnosis (odds ratio 1.87 per 10 year decrease, 95%CI1.50-2.32, p < 0.001). gBRCA mutation risk was predicted to be > 10% for womendiagnosed below approximately 50 years.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the general understanding that a heterozygous mutationprobability of 10% or greater justifies gBRCA mutation screening, women with TNBCdiagnosed before the age of 50 years and no familial history of breast andovarian cancer should be tested for gBRCA mutations. In Germany, this wouldconcern approximately 880 women with newly diagnosed TNBC per year, of whomapproximately 150 are expected to be identified as carriers of a pathogenic gBRCAmutation.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4029-y PMCID: PMC5842578PMID: 29514593
