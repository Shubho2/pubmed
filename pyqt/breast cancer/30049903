Case 1:A 61-year-old woman who wasdiagnosed with breast cancer 14 years earlier presented with rapid deterioration of visual acuity, eye pain, and limitation of left-sided extraocular motility.Magnetic resonance(MR)images showed an enhanced lesion in the left orbital apex, ethmoid sinus, and right middle fossa. The first gamma knife radiotherapy(35 Gy, 5 Fr)was performed successfully, but was followed by recurrence 18 months laterin the right intraorbital, where newly formed iso-intensity masses in theextraconal compartment were found. The second gamma knife radiosurgery wasperformed for three masses(20 Gy). Case 2:A 35-year-old woman with breast cancer who was diagnosed 22 months earlier was treated for meningeal carcinomatosis bywhole-brain radiation(30 Gy, 10 Fr)and intrathecal chemotherapy. Eight monthslater, swelling in both eyelids and limitation of extraocular motility developed rapidly. MR imaging revealed an infiltrating lesion in the cone with heterogenoussignal that was encasing, but not infiltrating the optic nerves. The extraconallesion extended into the soft tissue of the lower eye lid. She expired one weekafter diagnosis. With the increasing number of long-term survivors with breastcancer, intraorbital metastases may be found during the course of treatment forintracranial lesions. Understanding the unique clinical presentation andcharacteristic MR findings of this rare entity are emphasized.DOI: 10.11477/mf.1436203779 PMID: 30049903
