Neil.bhola@ucsf.edu.Cetuximab, the FDA-approved anti-EGFR antibody for head and neck squamous cellcarcinoma (HNSCC), has displayed limited efficacy due to the emergence ofintrinsic and acquired resistance. We and others have demonstrated that cetuximabresistance in HNSCC is driven by alternative receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK),including HER3, MET, and AXL. In an effort to overcome cetuximab resistance andcircumvent toxicities associated with the administration of multiple RTKinhibitors, we sought to identify a common molecular target that regulatesexpression of multiple RTK. Bromodomain-containing protein-4 (BRD4) has beenshown to regulate the transcription of various RTK in the context of resistanceto PI3K and HER2 inhibition in breast cancer models. We hypothesized that, inHNSCC, targeting BRD4 could overcome cetuximab resistance by depletingalternative RTK expression. We generated independent models of cetuximabresistance in HNSCC cell lines and interrogated their RTK and BRD4 expressionprofiles. Cetuximab-resistant clones displayed increased expression andactivation of several RTK, such as MET and AXL, as well as an increasedpercentage of BRD4-expressing cells. Both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition ofBRD4 abrogated cell viability in models of acquired and intrinsic cetuximabresistance and was associated with a robust decrease in alternative RTKexpression by cetuximab. Combined treatment with cetuximab and bromodomaininhibitor JQ1 significantly delayed acquired resistance and RTK upregulation inpatient-derived xenograft models of HNSCC. These findings indicate that thecombination of cetuximab and bromodomain inhibition may be a promisingtherapeutic strategy for patients with HNSCC.Significance: Inhibition ofbromodomain protein BRD4 represents a potential therapeutic strategy tocircumvent the toxicities and financial burden of targeting the multiple receptortyrosine kinases that drive cetuximab resistance in HNSCC and NSCLC.GraphicalAbstract:http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/15/4331/F1.large.jpg CancerRes; 78(15); 4331-43. ©2018 AACR.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-0459 PMCID: PMC6072571 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29792310
