Commonly, HER2 expression isassociated with poor clinical outcome or chemoresistance in ovarian and breastcancer patients. Treatment with humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, suchas trastuzumab or pertuzumab, has improved the outcome of patients withHER2-positive metastatic gastric or breast cancer, but not all patients benefit. In this study, the bispecific antibody [(HER2)2xCD16] in the tribody format wasemployed to re-direct CD16-expressing γδ T lymphocytes as well as natural killer (NK) cells to the tumor-associated cell surface antigen HER2 to enhance theircytotoxic anti-tumor activity. Tribody [(HER2)2xCD16] comprises two HER2-specificsingle chain fragment variable fused to a fragment antigen binding directed tothe CD16 (FcγRIII) antigen expressed on γδ T cells and NK cells. Our resultsrevealed the superiority of tribody [(HER2)2xCD16] compared to trastuzumab intriggering γδ T cell and NK cell-mediated lysis of HER2-expressing tumor cells,such as PDAC, breast cancer, and autologous primary ovarian tumors. The increasedefficacy of [(HER2)2xCD16] can be explained by an enhanced degranulation ofimmune cells. Although CD16 expression was decreased on γδ T cells in severalPDAC patients and the number of tumor-infiltrating NK cells and γδ T cells wasimpaired in ovarian cancer patients, [(HER2)2xCD16] selectively enhancedcytotoxicity of cells from these patients. Here, unique anti-tumor properties of tribody [(HER2)2xCD16] are identified which beyond addressing HER2 overexpressingsolid tumors may allow to treat with similar immunoconstructs combined with theadoptive transfer of γδ T cells and NK cells refractory hematologicalmalignancies. A major advantage of γδ T cells and NK cells in the transplantsituation of refractory hematological malignancies is given by theirHLA-independent killing and a reduced graft-versus-host disease.DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00814 PMCID: PMC5916959PMID: 29725336
