The importance of such tools is underscored by the fact that manyanti-cancer therapies are generally ineffective against established metastases.This makes a major contribution to the fact that metastatic spread is responsiblefor over 90% of cancer patient deaths. It was therefore timely that the recent"Seed and Soil: In Vivo Models of Metastasis" conference held in Berlin, Germany (27-29 of November 2017) aimed to give an in-depth overview of the latestresearch models and tools for studying metastasis, and to showcase recentfindings from world-leading metastasis researchers. This Meeting Reportsummarises the major themes of this ground-breaking conference.DOI: 10.1007/s10585-018-9886-x PMID: 29589151
