PTs were classified as benign, borderline, andmalignant using surgical specimens. The clinicopathological characteristicsaccording to solitary and multiple lesions on ipsilateral breast and histologicalchange after local recurrence were examined.RESULTS: The median patient age was 42 years (range 12-72 years). The finalpathologic diagnosis was benign PTs in 95 patients (76.6%), borderline PTs in 21 (16.9%), and malignant PTs in 8 (6.5%). The size of benign PTs [median 4.2 cm(range 1-21 cm)] was significantly smaller than that of malignant PTs [median11.3 cm (range 6-27 cm)] (p < 0.001). Eight of the 95 benign PTs (8.4%) hadmultiple lesions, while all malignant PTs had solitary lesion. With a medianfollow-up period of 45 months, five patients with malignant PTs (62.5%) developeddistant metastases while 13 patients with benign PTs (13.5%) and 6 patients with borderline PTs (28.6%) had local recurrence only without malignant transition.The median overall survival period of those with malignant PTs was 22.5 months(range 5-109 months).CONCLUSIONS: Histologically benign and borderline PTs had a good prognosiswithout malignant transition even after developing repeat recurrence in contrast with malignant PTs that might be a solitary lesion.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0882-4 PMID: 29951882
