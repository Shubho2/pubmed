For patients with stages II and III HER2-positive breast cancer, administering 1Â year of trastuzumab plus comprehensive chemotherapy is the standard of care. However, the pivotal adjuvanttrials had very few older patients and patients with small HER2-positive tumors. In this review, we will discuss the clinical data regarding strategies tode-escalate adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with early stage HER2-positive disease.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-2500 PMID: 29589471
