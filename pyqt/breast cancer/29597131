This study aimed toderive utility scores of patients with breast cancer and precancer in China.MATERIAL AND METHODS: An interviewer-administered cross-sectional survey wasconducted in 12 provinces across China from 2013 to 2014. The three-levelEuroQol-5-Dimension instrument was used to evaluate quality of life, and utility scores were generated using the Chinese value set. Univariate and multivariateanalyses were performed to explore the determinants of utility scores.RESULTS: In total, 2626 breast cancer and 471 precancer patients were included.Mean age was 49.1 for breast cancer and 41.4 years for precancer (p < 0.001).Among the five dimensions, pain/discomfort was the most reported problem, 53.9%in breast cancer and 29.3% in precancer patients. Mean (95% CI) utility scoresfor breast cancer and precancer patients were estimated as 0.887 (0.875-0.899)and 0.781 (0.774-0.788), and the scores of breast cancer at stage-I, stage-II,stage-III and stage-IV were 0.789 (0.774-0.805), 0.793 (0.783-0.802), 0.774(0.759-0.788) and 0.686 (0.654-0.717), respectively. Mean (95% CI) visualanalogue scale scores for breast cancer and precancer were 75.6 (74.0-77.3) and72.8 (72.3-73.3). Multiple regression showed advanced clinical stage, lowereducational level, lower household income, surgery treatment, and undergoingtreatment were independently associated with lower utility scores for breastcancer patients.CONCLUSION: The utility scores deteriorate with the severity of breast neoplasms.Detailed utility scores of breast cancer and precancer are fundamental forfurther cost-utility analysis in China.Copyright © 2018.
