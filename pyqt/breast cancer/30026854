China.Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounting for roughly 90% of all primary liverneoplasms is the sixth most frequent neoplasm and the second prominent reason of tumor fatality worldwide. As regulators of diverse biological processes, longnon-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in onset and development of neoplasms.With the continuous booming of well-featured lncRNAs in HCC from 2016 to now, we reviewed the newly-presented comprehension about the relationship between lncRNAsand HCC in this study. To be specific, we summarized the overview function andstudy tools of lncRNAs, elaborated the roles of lncRNAs in HCC, and sketched the molecule mechanisms of lncRNAs in HCC. In addition, the application of lncRNAsserving as biomarkers in early diagnosis and outcome prediction of HCC patientswas highlighted.DOI: 10.7150/jca.24560 PMCID: PMC6036883PMID: 30026854
