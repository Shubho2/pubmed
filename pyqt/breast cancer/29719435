We evaluatedwhether the nlr can be a predictive factor for pathologic complete response (pcr)after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nac) in patients with triple-negative breastcancer (tnbc).Methods: We analyzed the correlation between response to nac and various factors,including the nlr, in 87 patients with tnbc who underwent nac. In addition, weanalyzed the association between the nlr and recurrence-free survival (rfs) inpatients with tnbc.Results: Of the 87 patients, 25 (28.7%) achieved a pcr. A high Ki-67 index and a low nlr were significantly associated with pcr. The pcr rate was higher inpatients having a high Ki-67 index (≥15%) than in those having a low Ki-67 index (35.7% vs. 0%, p = 0.002) and higher in patients having a low nlr (≤1.7) than in those having a high nlr (42.1% vs. 18.4%, p = 0.018). In multiple logisticanalysis, a low nlr remained the only predictive factor for pcr (odds ratio:4.274; p = 0.008). In the survival analysis, the rfs was significantly higher in the low nlr group than in the high nlr group (5-year rfs rate: 83.7% vs. 66.9%;log-rank p = 0.016).Conclusions: Our findings that the nlr is a predictor of pcr to nac and also aprognosticator of recurrence suggest an association between response tochemotherapy and inflammation in patients with tnbc. The pretreatment nlr can be a useful predictive and prognostic marker in patients with tnbc scheduled fornac.DOI: 10.3747/co.25.3888 PMCID: PMC5927790PMID: 29719435
