Beta-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB)is the main physiological ketone body, whose concentration can reach plasmalevels of 2-6 mM during KDs or fasting. The impact of 3-OHB on the biology oftumor cells described so far is contradictory. Therefore, we investigated theeffect of a physiological concentration of 3 mM 3-OHB on metabolism,proliferation, and viability of breast cancer (BC) cells in vitro.Methods: Seven different human BC cell lines (BT20, BT474, HBL100, MCF-7, MDA-MB 231, MDA-MB 468, and T47D) were cultured in medium with 5 mM glucose in thepresence of 3 mM 3-OHB at mild hypoxia (5% oxygen) or normoxia (21% oxygen).Metabolic profiling was performed by quantification of the turnover of glucose,lactate, and 3-OHB and by Seahorse metabolic flux analysis. Expression of keyenzymes of ketolysis as well as the main monocarboxylic acid transporter MCT2 andthe glucose-transporter GLUT1 was analyzed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Theeffect of 3-OHB on short- and long-term cell proliferation as well as chemo- and radiosensitivity were also analyzed.Results: 3-OHB significantly changed the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) andextracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in BT20 cells resulting in a moreoxidative energetic phenotype. MCF-7 and MDA-MB 468 cells had increased ECAR onlyin response to 3-OHB, while the other three cell types remained uninfluenced. Allcells expressed MCT2 and GLUT1, thus being able to uptake the metabolites. Theconsumption of 3-OHB was not strongly linked to mRNA overexpression of keyenzymes of ketolysis and did not correlate with lactate production and glucoseconsumption. Neither 3-OHB nor acetoacetate did interfere with proliferation.Further, 3-OHB incubation did not modify the response of the tested BC cell linesto chemotherapy or radiation.Conclusions: We found that a physiological level of 3-OHB can change theenergetic profile of some BC cell lines. However, 3-OHB failed to influencedifferent biologic processes in these cells, e.g., cell proliferation and theresponse to common breast cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Thus, we have no evidence that 3-OHB generally influences the biology of breast cancer cells invitro.DOI: 10.1186/s40170-018-0180-9 PMCID: PMC5996481PMID: 29942509
