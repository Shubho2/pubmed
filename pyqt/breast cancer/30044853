Myoepithelial cells are the barrier between epithelial cells andthe surrounding stroma in the breast ductal system. A number of myoepithelialimmunohistochemistry markers have been identified and validated in human tissuefor use by pathologists as diagnostic tools to distinguish in situ carcinoma frominvasive breast cancer. However, robust myoepithelial markers for mouse mammarytissue have been largely under-utilised. Here, we investigated the utility of themyoepithelial markers smooth muscle actin (SMA), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain(SMMHC), cytokeratin-14 (CK14) and p63 to discriminate mammary intraepithelialneoplasia (MIN) from invasive disease in the C57BL/6J MMTV-PyMT transgenic model of mammary carcinoma. We identified that SMMHC and CK14 are retained in early in situ neoplasia and are appropriate markers for distinguishing MIN from invasivedisease in this model. Additionally, the proliferation marker Ki67 is a superior marker for differentiating between normal and hyperplastic ducts, prior to thedevelopment of MIN. Based on this, we developed a scoring matrix fordiscriminating normal, hyperplasia, MIN and invasive lesions in this spontaneous mammary tumorigenesis model. This study demonstrates heterogeneous expression of myoepithelial proteins throughout tumour development, and highlights the need to characterise the most appropriate markers in other models of early breast cancer to allow accurate classification of disease state.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0201370 PMCID: PMC6059463PMID: 30044853
