Janice.Lu@med.usc.edu.Endocrine therapy has historically formed the basis of treatment of metastatichormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The development of endocrine resistance has led to the development of newer endocrine drug combinations. Use of theCDK4/6 inhibitors has significantly improved progression-free survival in thisgroup of patients. There are multiple studies of the use of P13K inhibitors andmTOR inhibitors for use as subsequent lines of therapy, particularly forendocrine resistance. The optimal sequencing of therapy should be based onmedical comorbidities, prior adjuvant therapies, quality of life, side-effectprofile, and disease-free interval.DOI: 10.1186/s13045-018-0620-6 PMCID: PMC5996460PMID: 29891002
