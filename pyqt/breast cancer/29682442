Thegreen synthesized gold-conjugated nanoparticles were characterized by surfaceplasmon resonance spectroscopy, High resolution transmission electron microscopy,X-ray diffraction studies and dynamic light scattering. A mechanism for thesynthesis and stabilization ofÂ gold-conjugated nanoparticles (AuNPs) has beenproposed. Anticancer activity of the stabilized AuNPs studied against MCF-7breast cancer cell line revealed that the stabilized AuNPs were highly effective for the apoptosis of cancer cells selectively. The antioxidant activity of thestem bark extract of Nerium oleander has also been studied against a long lived2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical at room temperature. Moreover, the utilizationof the stabilized AuNPs as a catalyst has also been demonstrated.DOI: 10.1186/s40580-018-0142-5 PMCID: PMC5906526PMID: 29682442
