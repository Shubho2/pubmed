This study aimed to identify factors that contribute to theoccurrence of complications after DTI ADM-assisted breast reconstruction.METHODS: Data were obtained from the BRIOS study, including all patients treated with DTI ADM-assisted breast reconstruction. Logistic regression analyses wereperformed to identify factors predictive of postoperative complications.RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (91 breasts) were included, of whom 27 (35 breasts) developed a surgical complication. Reoperations were performed in 29 breasts (32 per cent), with prosthesis removal in 22 (24 per cent). In multivariableanalyses, mastectomy weight was associated with complications (odds ratio (OR)1·94, 95 per cent c.i. 1·33 to 2·83), reoperations (OR 1·70, 1·12 to 2·59) andremoval of the implant (OR 1·55, 1·11 to 2·17). Younger patients (OR 1·07, 1·01to 1·13) and those who received adjuvant chemotherapy (OR 4·83, 1·15 to 20·24)more frequently required reoperation. In univariable analyses, adjuvantradiotherapy showed a trend towards more complications (OR 7·23, 0·75 to 69·95)and removal of the implant (OR 5·12, 0·76 to 34·44), without reaching statisticalsignificance.CONCLUSION: Breast size appeared to be the most significant predictor ofcomplications in DTI ADM-assisted breast reconstruction. The technique shouldpreferably be performed in patients with small to moderate sized breasts.Registration number: NTR5446 ( http://www.trialregister.nl).© 2018 The Authors.
