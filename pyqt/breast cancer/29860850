The goals of treatment for MBC are still to maintain quality of life and prolong survival.However, some cases of MBC with a long-term relapse free survival occurs,implying that a small subset of MBC patients could become curable. Although it isa controversial issue of whether MBC can be cured, a more aggressivemultidisciplinary approach to MBC with a curable intent may help improve MBCpatient outcomes. The Earlier detection of metastatic disease by using modernimaging technologies may allow the detection of metastasis before cancer cellsspread widely. This brief review focuses on the potentials of clinical responseat initial therapy of MBC and early detection of metastatic disease of thepossibility of cure of MBC patients.DOI: 10.21037/cco.2018.05.01 PMID: 29860850
