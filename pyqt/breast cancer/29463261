However, the clinical significance of HMGB2 signaling in humanbreast cancer progression remains unknown.METHODS: We investigated HMGB2 expression in 185 cases of primary breast cancerand matched normal breast tissue specimens, and explored the underlyingmechanisms of altered HMGB2 expression as well as the impact of this alteredexpression on breast cancer growth and on aerobic glycolysis using in vitro andanimal models of breast cancer.RESULTS: HMGB2 was more highly expressed in tumor-cell nuclei of breast cancercells than in the adjacent normal breast tissues (P < 0.05). Higher HMGB2expression correlated with larger tumor size (P = 0.003) and advanced tumor stage(P = 0.033). A Cox proportional hazards model revealed that HMGB2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer after radical resection(P < 0.05). Experimentally, knockdown of HMGB2 expression by stable transfectedshRNA significantly decreased the growth and glycolysis of breast cancer cellsboth in vitro and in mouse models. Mechanically, promotion of breast cancerprogression by HMGB2 directly and significantly correlated with activation ofLDHB expression and inactivation of FBP1 expression.CONCLUSIONS: These results disclose a novel role for HMGB2 in reprogramming themetabolic process in breast cancer cells by targeting LDHB and FBP1 and providepotential prognostic predictors for breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1186/s12964-018-0219-0 PMCID: PMC5819211PMID: 29463261
