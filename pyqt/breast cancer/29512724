Processes incancer cells are often mediated by Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and other signaling pathways.Traditional therapies are often problematic. Recently, a novel polysaccharidederived from algae extract was investigated due to the increasing interest inbiological activities of compounds from marine organisms. The effect of thisnovel polysaccharide on human MKN45 gastric carcinoma cells was determinedpreviously. The current aimed to determine whether the polysaccharide affectsother types of cancer, and the deeper mechanisms involved in the process. HumanMCF-7 breast cancer cells were used to investigate the novel polysaccharide forits role in the cell growth and migration, and determine the mechanisms affected.MTT assay, nuclear staining and fluorescence activated cell sorting analysisdemonstrated that the novel polysaccharide reduced the viability of MCF-7 cellsby inducing cell apoptosis and arresting the cells at G2/M phase. Results ofwestern blot analysis demonstrated that phosphorylation of JNK and expression of p53, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were upregulated in the polysaccharide-treated MCF-7cells. SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK, maintained MCF-7 cell viability, prevented cell apoptosis and cycle arrest, and downregulated the polysaccharide-inducedprotein phosphorylation/expression. However, a migration assay demonstrated that the novel polysaccharide did not change the migration of MCF-7 cells, as well as the expression of p38 MAPK, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -2. Takentogether, the current study demonstrated that the novel polysaccharide suppressedcancer cell growth, induced cancer cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest via JNKsignaling, but had no effect on cancer cell migration and p38 MAPK signaling.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4297 PMCID: PMC5873927PMID: 29512724
