[Epub ahead of print]Normal breast-derived epithelial cells with luminal and intrinsicsubtype-enriched gene expression document inter-individual differences in theirdifferentiation cascade.Kumar B(1), Prasad MS(1), Bhat-Nakshatri P(1), Anjanappa M(1), Kalra M(2), MarinoN(3), Storniolo AMV(4), Rao X(5), Liu S(6), Wan J(7), Liu Y(8), Nakshatri H(9).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine.(2)Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine.(3)Department of Medicine, Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis.(4)Department of Internal Medicine, IU Simon Cancer Center.(5)Indiana University School of Medicine.(6)Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School ofMedicine.(7)Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis.(8)Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine.(9)Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicinehnakshat@iupui.edu.Cell type origin is one of the factors that determine molecular features oftumors, but resources to validate this concept are scarce because of technicaldifficulties in propagating major cell types of adult organs. Previous attemptsto generate such resources to study breast cancer have yielded predominantlybasal-type cell lines. We have created a panel of immortalized cell lines fromcore breast biopsies of ancestry-mapped healthy women that form ductal structuressimilar to normal breast in 3D cultures and expressed markers of major cell typesincluding the luminal-differentiated cell-enriched ERα-FOXA1-GATA3 transcription factor network. We have also created cell lines from PROCR (CD201)+/EpCAM- cells that are likely the "normal" counterpart of the claudin-low subtype of breastcancers. RNA-seq and PAM50 intrinsic subtype clustering identified these celllines as the "normal" counterparts of luminal A, basal, and normal-like subtypes and validated via immunostaining with basal-enriched KRT14 and luminal-enrichedKRT19. We further characterized these cell lines by flow cytometry fordistribution patterns of stem/basal, luminal-progenitor, mature/differentiated,multi-potent PROCR+ cells, and organogenesis-enriched epithelial/mesenchymalhybrid cells using CD44/CD24, CD49f/EpCAM, CD271/EpCAM, CD201/EpCAM, andALDEFLUOR assays and E-Cadherin/Vimentin double-staining. These cell lines showedinter-individual heterogeneity in stemness/differentiation capabilities andbaseline activity of signaling molecules such as NF-κB, AKT2, pERK, and BRD4.These resources can be used to test the emerging concept that genetic variations in regulatory regions contribute to widespread differences in gene expression in 'normal' conditions among the general population and can delineate the impact of cell type origin on tumor progression.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-0509 PMID: 29997232
