Bexarotene is a specific RXRs agonist which has been granted by FDAapproval for the clinical treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Itscancer prevention and treatment potentials in various tumors have been underinvestigation over the past decade. Areas covered: This review summarizes theefficacy and underlying mechanisms of bexarotene for the treatment of multiplecancers based on the launched clinical trials as well as the basic studies.Expert commentary: In general, bexarotene is an active and reasonablechemoprevention and treatment for various cancers and its combination regimenwith other cytotoxic agents or targeted drugs may significantly enhance efficacy and at the same time reduce toxicity due to their nonoverlapping side effects.However, only a subpopulation of bexarotene treated patients benefited frombexarotene administration in most cases. The level of RXRs may serve as apreliminary indicator for the bexarotene response in cancers such as non-smallcell lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, thyroid cancer andmelanoma. Further identification and verification of bexarotene responsebiomarkers may finally lead to the personalized clinical application ofbexarotene on cancers beyond CTCL.DOI: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1449648 PMID: 29521139
