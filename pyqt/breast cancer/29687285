A greatdeal of effort has been made to discover new agents for cancer treatment. Xao tamphan (Paramignya trimera) is a traditional medicine of Vietnam used in cancertreatment for a long time, yet there is not much scientific evidence proving its anticancer potency. The study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of Paramignyatrimera extract (PTE) on multicellular tumor spheres (MCTS) of MCF-7 cells using hanging drop technique.METHODS: Firstly, MCF-7 cells were seeded on hanging drop plates, spheroid sizewas tracked, and growth curve was measured by MTT assay and AlamarBlue® assay.The necrotic core of MCTS was evaluated by propidium iodide (PI) staining.Toxicity of doxorubicin (DOX) and tirapazamine (TPZ) was then tested on 3D model compared to 2D culture condition.RESULTS: The results showed that the IC50 of DOX on 3D MCF-7 cells was nearly 50 times greater than monolayer MCF-7 cells. In contrast, TPZ (an agent which isspecifically toxic under hypoxic conditions) had significantly lower IC50 in 3Dcondition than in 2D. The toxicity tests for PTE showed that PTE stronglyinhibited MCF-7 cells in both 2D and 3D conditions. Interestingly, the IC50 ofPTE in 3D model was remarkably lower than in 2D (IC50 value was168.9 ± 11.65 μg/ml compared to 260.8 ± 16.54 μg/ml, respectively). The invasion assay showed that PTE completely inhibited invasion of MCF-7 cells at 250 μg/mLconcentration. Also, flow cytometry results indicated that PTE effectivelyinduced apoptosis in MCF-7 spheroids in 3D condition at 250 μg/mL concentration.CONCLUSION: The results from this study emphasize the promise of PTE in cancertherapy.DOI: 10.1007/5584_2018_148 PMID: 29687285
