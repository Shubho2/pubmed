We describe the postoperativecomplication rates of elderly (≥ 70 years) women with breast cancer and comparethem with young (40-69 years) women.METHODS: Data were extracted from the National Surgical Quality ImprovementProgram database (2004-2014). We included women with invasive breast cancer whounderwent surgery. Outcomes were 30-day postoperative morbidity andmortality (complications), which were compared between young and elderly women.Morbidity was categorized using the Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System (SURPAS) clusters.RESULTS: We identified 100,037 women of which 26.7% were elderly. Compared toyoung women, elderly women were more likely to have more comorbidities andundergo breast-conserving surgery, but less likely to undergo lymph node surgery,breast reconstruction, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. While the 30-day overallmorbidity rate was not significantly different between young and elderly women(3.9 vs. 3.8%, p = 0.2), elderly women did have significantly higher rates ofpulmonary, cardiac (arrest and myocardial infarction), venous thromboembolic, andneurological morbidity. Specific morbidities that showed significantly lowerrates among elderly women included wound disruption and deep and organ spacesurgical site infection. Any cause death was significantly higher in elderlycompared to young women (0.2 vs. 0.05%, p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: While some specific 30-day postoperative morbidities were more oftenseen in elderly women, the overall 30-day postoperative complication rate wasvery low. These data support the safety of breast cancer surgery in well-selectedelderly patients.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4747-5 PMID: 29546481
