Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by itsco-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining theproliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated inmediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore,understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs iscritical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippoeffector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell-likeproperties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the activation ofTAZ in various breast cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling activated the GTPase Rac1,which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity. In a complexwith the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-activating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. Byactivating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence,the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 activityin CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZabundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast cancer patientdatabase revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in tumors. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in afeed-forward loop of TAZ activation and the acquisition of CSC properties.Copyright © 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science.
