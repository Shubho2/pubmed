Synthesized AgNPs were studied theircharacteristics and their anti-proliferative property was investigated in breast cancer cell line (4T1). Based on zeta sizer analysis, the size of the AgNPs was103.5 nm and potential -9.57 eV. Fe-SEM results showed particle size of69.4-99.4 nm while TEM images indicated the particle size of 18-24 nm. Indose-dependent study, AgNPs showed 93% of anti-proliferative activity at 50 μg/mlwhereas the methanolic extract of M. longifolia showed 80% activity only at10-fold increased concentration (500 μg/ml). AgNPs exhibited higher level ofcytotoxicity in breast cancer cell line than extract through cell walldegradation and ROS generation. Such effective AgNPs could be investigatedfurther through in vivo models with a view to develop anticancer drug.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
