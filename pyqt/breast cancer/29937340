Electronic address: jonathan.james@nuh.nhs.uk.(2)Nottingham Breast Institute, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, NG5 1PB, UK.Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is a valuable tool in the diagnosisand staging of primary breast cancer. It combines an iodinated contrast agentwith conventional mammography to improve diagnostic accuracy, particularly inwomen with denser parenchymal background patterns. This review describes the CESMtechnique, reviews performance compared to conventional mammography and magnetic resonance imaging, assesses its role in the diagnosis and staging of primarybreast cancer, and investigates its potential as a screening tool.Copyright Â© 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
