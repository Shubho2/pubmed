[Epub ahead of print]Dynamic microRNA activity identifies therapeutic targets in trastuzumab-resistantHER2+ breast cancer.Decker JT(1), Hall MS(1), Blaisdell RB(1), Schwark K(1), Jeruss JS(1)(2), SheaLD(1).Author information: (1)Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,Michigan.(2)Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in numerous physiologic and pathologicprocesses, such as the development of resistance to chemotherapy. Determining therole of miRNAs in these processes is often accomplished through measuring miRNAabundance by polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, or microarrays. We havedeveloped a system for the large-scale monitoring of dynamic miRNA activity andhave applied this system to identify the contribution miRNA activity to thedevelopment of trastuzumab resistance in a cell model of HER2+ breast cancer.MiRNA activity measurements identified significantly different activity levelsbetween BT474 cells (HER2 + breast cancer) and BT474R cells (HER2 + breast cancercells selected for resistance to trastuzumab). We created a library of 32 miRNAreporter constructs, which were delivered by lentiviral transduction into cells, and miRNA activity was quantified by bioluminescence imaging. Upon treatment withthe bioimmune therapy, trastuzumab, the activity of 11 miRNAs were significantly altered in parental BT474 cells, and 20 miRNAs had significantly altered activityin the therapy-resistant BT474R cell line. A combination of statistical, network and classification analysis was applied to the dynamic data, which identifiedmiR-21 as a controlling factor in trastuzumab response. Our data suggesteddownregulation of miR-21 activity was associated with resistance, which wasconfirmed in an additional HER2 + breast cancer cell line, SKBR3. Collectively,the dynamic miRNA activity measurements and analysis provided a system toidentify new potential therapeutic targets in treatment-resistant cancers.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/bit.26791 PMID: 29981261
