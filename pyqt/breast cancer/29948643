Hence, a suitable positronemission tomography radiotracer for the in vivo assessment of the MCHR1pharmacology is imperative. The current paper contrasts the extensive in vitro,in vivo, and ex vivo assessments of the radiotracers [18F]FE@SNAP and[11C]SNAP-7941 and provides comprehensive information about their biological and physicochemical properties. Furthermore, it examines their suitability forfirst-in-man imaging studies.PROCEDURES: Kinetic real-time cell-binding studies with [18F]FE@SNAP and[11C]SNAP-7941 were conducted on adherent Chines hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cellsstably expressing the human MCHR1 and MCHR2. Small animal imaging studies on miceand rats were performed under displacement and baseline conditions, as well asafter pretreatment with the P-glycoprotein/breast cancer resistant proteininhibitor tariquidar. After the imaging studies, detailed analyses of the ex vivobiodistribution were performed. Ex vivo metabolism was determined in rat bloodand brain and analyzed at various time points using a quantitative radio-HPLCassay.RESULTS: [11C]SNAP-7941 demonstrates high uptake on CHO-K1-hMCHR1 cells, whereas no uptake was detected for the CHO-K1-hMCHR2 cells. In contrast, [18F]FE@SNAPevinced binding to CHO-K1-hMCHR1 and CHO-K1-hMCHR2 cells. Imaging studies with[18F]FE@SNAP and [11C]SNAP-7941 showed an increased brain uptake after tariquidarpretreatment in mice, as well as in rats, and exhibited a significant difference between the time-activity curves of the baseline and blocking groups.Biodistribution of both tracers demonstrated a decreased uptake afterdisplacement. [11C]SNAP-7941 revealed a high metabolic stability in rats, whereas[18F]FE@SNAP was rapidly metabolized.CONCLUSIONS: Both radiotracers demonstrate appropriate imaging properties for theMCHR1. However, the pronounced metabolic stability as well as superiorselectivity and affinity of [11C]SNAP-7941 underlines the decisive superiorityover [18F]FE@SNAP.DOI: 10.1007/s11307-018-1212-0 PMID: 29948643
