[Epubahead of print]New tailored substituted benzothiazole Schiff base Cu(II)/Zn(II) antitumor drugentities: effect of substituents on DNA binding profile, antimicrobial andcytotoxic activity.Zehra S(1), Shavez Khan M(2), Ahmad I(2), Arjmand F(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Chemistry , Aligarh Muslim University , Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh , India.(2)b Department of Agricultural Microbiology , Aligarh Muslim University ,Aligarh 202002, Uttar Pradesh , India.New tailored Cu(II) & Zn(II) metal-based antitumor drug entities were synthesizedfrom substituted benzothiazole o‒vanillin Schiff base ligands. The complexes werethoroughly characterized by elemental analysis, spectroscopic studies {IR, 1H &13C NMR, ESI-MS, EPR} and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The structureactivity relationship (SAR) studies of benzothiazole Cu(II) & Zn(II) complexeshaving molecular formulas [C30H22CuN5O7S2], [C30H20Cl2CuN5O7S2],[C30H20CuF2N5O7S2], [C30H22N4O4S2Zn], [C30H20Cl2N4O4S2Zn], and[C30H20F2N5O7S2Zn], with CT‒DNA were performed by employing absorption, emission titrations, and hydrodynamic measurements. The DNA binding affinity wasquantified by Kb and Ksv values which gave higher binding propensity forchloro-substituted Cu(II) [C30H20Cl2CuN5O7S2] complex, suggestive of groovebinding mode with subtle partial intercalation. Molecular properties and druglikeness profile were assessed for the ligands and all the Lipinski's rules were found to be obeyed. The antimicrobial potential of ligands and their Cu(II) &Zn(II) complexes were screened against some notably important pathogens viz., E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis, and C. albicans. The cytotoxicity ofthe complexes [C30H20Cl2CuN5O7S2], [C30H20CuF2N5O7S2], [C30H20Cl2N4O4S2Zn], and[C30H20F2N5O7S2Zn] were evaluated against five human cancer cell lines viz.,MCF‒7 (breast), MIA‒PA‒CA‒2 (pancreatic), HeLa (cervix) and Hep‒G2 (Hepatoma) andA498 (Kidney) by SRB assay which revealed that chloro-substituted[C30H20Cl2CuN5O7S2] complex, exhibited pronounced specific cytotoxicity with GI50value of 4.8 μg/ml against HeLa cell line. Molecular docking studies were alsoperformed to explore the binding modes and orientation of the complexes in theDNA helix.DOI: 10.1080/07391102.2018.1467794 PMID: 29676660
