We investigated theefficacy of plasma micro-RNA (miR)-21, miR-23b, miR-190, miR-200b and miR-200c,related to dormancy and metastasis, to predict the outcome of patients with earlybreast cancer.METHODS: miRNAs were evaluated by RT-qPCR in plasma obtained before adjuvantchemotherapy. miRNA expression, classified as high or low according to medianvalues, correlated with relapse and survival. Receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curves were constructed to determine miRNA sensitivity and specificity.RESULTS: miR-21 (p < 0.001), miR-23b (p = 0.028) and miR-200c (p < 0.001)expression were higher and miR-190 was lower (p = 0.013) in relapsed (n = 49),compared to non-relapsed patients (n = 84). Interestingly, miR-190 was lower(p = 0.0032) in patients with early relapse (at < 3 years; n = 23) compared tothose without early relapse (n = 110). On the other hand, miR-21 and miR-200cwere higher (p = 0.015 and p < 0.001, respectively) in patients with late relapse(relapse at ≥ 5 years; n = 20) as compared to non-relapsed patients. HighmiR-200c was associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.005) and high miR-21 with both shorter DFS and overall survival (OS) (p < 0.001 andp = 0.033, respectively) compared to low expression. ROC curve analysis revealed that miR-21, miR-23b, miR-190 and miR-200c discriminated relapsed fromnon-relapsed patients. A combination of of miR-21, miR-23b and miR-190 showedhigher sensitivity and specificity in ROC analyses compared to each miRNA alone; accuracy was further improved by adding lymph node infiltration and tumor gradeto the panel of three miRs (AUC 0.873). Furthermore, the combination of miR-200c,lymph node infiltration, tumor grade and estrogen receptor predicted late relapse(AUC 0.890).CONCLUSIONS: Circulating miRNAs are differentially expressed among relapsed andnon-relapsed patients with early breast cancer and predict recurrence many years before its clinical detection. Our results suggest that miRNAs representpotential circulating biomarkers in early breast cancer.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1001-3 PMCID: PMC6042266PMID: 29996899
