This studyuses a meta-analysis to explore the prognostic value of CXCL12/SDF1 expression inbreast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Sciencedatabases were searched from inception to November 25, 2017. Studiesinvestigating the correlation between CXCL12/SDF1 expression and survival inbreast carcinoma were included. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidenceinterval (95% CI) was used to assess the prognostic value of CXCL12/SDF1 inbreast cancer. The pooled odds radio (OR) and 95% CI was applied to evaluate the relationship between CXCL12/SDF1 expression and the clinical characteristics ofbreast cancer.RESULTS: Eight eligible studies involving 2205 patients were identified. HigherCXCL12/SDF1 protein expression was associated with better disease-free survival(DFS) (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68-0.86; P < .0001) and overall survival (OS) (HR,0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.87; P = .004) in breast cancer. Furthermore, higherCXCL12/SDF1 protein expression was associated with positive ER status (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.08-3.45; P = .03), negative HER2 status (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.06-6.59;P = .04), and small tumor size (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.47-4.22; P = .0007) in breastcancer, respectively. However, there were no significant associations between theCXCL12/SDF1 mRNA expression and other prognostic parameters, such as TNM stage,age, PR status, lymph node, and nuclear grade (P > .05 for all).CONCLUSIONS: This present meta-analysis suggests that CXCL12/SDF1 proteinexpression is a good prognostic biomarker in breast cancer. In addition, theover-expression of CXCL12/SDF1 protein was associated with positive ER status,negative HER2 status and small tumor size.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
