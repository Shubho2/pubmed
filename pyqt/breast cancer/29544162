TheAZURE trial (ISRCTN79831382) evaluated the impact of adjuvant zoledronic acid(ZOL) on fractures. The AZURE trial is an academic, multi-centre, randomisedphase III study evaluating the addition of ZOL 4 mg to standard therapy(neo/adjuvant chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy) for 5 years (administered byintravenous (iv) infusion every 3-4 weeks for 6 doses, then 3 monthly × 8 and 6monthly × 5) in patients with stage II/III early breast cancer. Fracture datacollected as part of skeletal-related adverse event reporting were analysed aftera median of 84.2 months of follow-up and 966 disease-free survival (DFS) events. We assessed number of fractures, time-to-first fracture and the incidence offractures before and after disease recurrence. Two hundred forty-four patientsreported ≥1 fracture, 140 (8.3%) in the control arm (171 fractures) and 104(6.2%) in the ZOL arm (120 fractures). Of the 291 fractures reported, 207fractures occurred in the absence of recurrence (control 111, ZOL 96), 80 afterrecurrence (control 59, ZOL 21). The 5-year fracture rate was reduced from 5.9%(95%CI 4.8, 7.1%; control) to 3.8% (95%CI 2.9, 4.7%) with ZOL. ZOL significantly increased time-to-first fracture (HR 0.69, 95%CI 0.53-0.90; P = 0.0053) but themajority of fracture prevention benefit occurred after a DFS event (HR 0.3; 95%CI0.17, 0.53; P < 0.001). Fracture benefits from ZOL were similar across menopausalsub-groups. In conclusion, adjuvant ZOL reduced the risk of clinical fractures,the majority of this protection occurred after disease recurrence.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
