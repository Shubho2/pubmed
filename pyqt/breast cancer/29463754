In the context of cancer, deregulated translation is a hallmark of transformation, promoting the proliferation, survival, and metastaticcapabilities of cancer cells. The best-studied factor involved in thetranslational control of cancer is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor4E (eIF4E). We and others have shown that eIF4E availability and phosphorylation promote metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer by selectively augmenting thetranslation of mRNAs involved in invasion and metastasis. However, the impact of translational control in cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME) isunknown. Here, we demonstrate that regulatory events affecting translation incells of the TME impact cancer progression. Mice bearing a mutation in thephosphorylation site of eIF4E (S209A) in cells comprising the TME are resistantto the formation of lung metastases in a syngeneic mammary tumor model. This isassociated with reduced survival of prometastatic neutrophils due to decreasedexpression of the antiapoptotic proteins BCL2 and MCL1. Furthermore, wedemonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation preventsmetastatic progression in vivo, supporting the development of phosphorylationinhibitors for clinical use.DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1717439115 PMCID: PMC5877985 [Available on 2018-09-06]PMID: 29463754
