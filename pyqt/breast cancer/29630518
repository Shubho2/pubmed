However, the value of circulating HOTAIRto predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains unclear.OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we analyzed whether pretreatment circulatingHOTAIR levels predict the response to NAC and investigated prognostic impact ofcirculating HOTAIR on disease-free survival (DFS) in breast cancer patientstreated with NAC.METHODS: Circulating HOTAIR levels in the serum of 112 breast cancer patientsbefore NAC were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. The correlation ofcirculating HOTAIR with the clinicopathologic status and the response to NAC wereanalyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were used to estimate the DFS.RESULTS: In 112 serum samples obtained before NAC, high circulating HOTAIR wasassociated with larger tumor size, more positive lymph nodes as well as moredistant metastasis. However, there was no significant correlation between thecirculating HOTAIR levels and age, Ki67 status or hormone receptor. Furthermore, patients with high circulating HOTAIR achieved less clinical response as well as pathologic complete response than those with low circulating HOTAIR (p< 0.05).The Kaplan-Meier survival curve with a median follow-up of 48 months demonstratedthat patients with high circulating HOTAIR expression had a worse disease-freesurvival than those with low circulating HOTAIR (log-rank p= 0.012).CONCLUSIONS: High circulating HOTAIR level correlates with less response toneoadjuvant chemotherapy as well as a worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. Therefore, the present study provides a favorable basis to use circulating HOTAIRas a predictor of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response.DOI: 10.3233/CBM-170874 PMID: 29630518
