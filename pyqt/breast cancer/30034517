Aggressive epithelialcancers might be an unfortunate 'side effect' of this highly sophisticatedbiological nature. Microenvironmental properties in the placenta and decidua are thought to be a key to feto-maternal immune tolerance. Recently, in 2016-2018, wepublished the first human genomic and epigenomic evidence of similar geneexpression profiles in immune regulatory genes in cancer (primary lobularinfiltrating breast cancer and ipsilateral axillary metastatic lymph nodes) andboth placenta and decidua of the same young patient with breast carcinoma during pregnancy. These findings led us to speculate that ectopic expression, orrepression, of 'PIES' might be used by cancer cells during carcinogenesis orcancer progression to elude immune vigilance in spite of tumour-associatedantigens or evolving neo antigenic landscapes. Cancers are well known tofrequently express embryonic antigens, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, used as cancer markers and detectable in the blood circulation, or to express ectopichormones. Why should cancer cells invent de novo complex new immune suppressionmechanisms, if they could simply use innate ones developed during the long-termevolution of placental mammals in order to hide fetal paternal antigens from the mother's own immune system? Monotremata (Prototheria-like Echidnas or PlatypusOrnithoryncus) are nonplacental egg-laying mammals and, in spite of rudimentarybreast epithelial ducts and lobules, they are seldom reported to suffer fromaggressive breast cancers.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.840 PMCID: PMC6027979PMID: 30034517
