Toxicity was assessed by the Common TerminologyCriteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 during the radiotherapy and follow-upclinics at 12 and 36 months after its completion. The study was designed toevaluate the toxicity at one year, 3 years and 5 years.RESULTS: Sixty-four patients were included from October 2007 to August 2010. All of them received concurrent adjuvant radiotherapy and bevacizumab (in 24 casesafter primary systemic treatment). All patients received non-fractionatedradiotherapy to breast or chest wall with or without irradiation of regionallymph nodes. Early toxicity has been previously reported. Median follow-up was46.4 months (range: 18-77 months). Median age was 53 years old (range:23-68 years). The 3-years overall survival was 93% (range: 87-100%). Evaluationof the toxicity at 3 years was available for 67% of the patients. There was a lowrate of toxicity: 14% grade 1 pain, 9% grade 1 fibrosis, 2% grade 1telangiectasia, 2% grade 1 paresis, 7% grade 1 lymphedema and 2% grade 3lymphedema. No grade 4 toxicity was observed. No patient had a left ventricularejection fraction below 50% at 3 years.CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent bevacizumab with locoregional radiotherapy is associated with acceptable 3-years toxicity in patients with breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO).
