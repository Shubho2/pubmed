H.Karst.: A Wild Grown MedicinalPlant in Jordan.Alhourani N(1), Kasabri V(1), Bustanji Y(1)(2), Abbassi R(1), Hudaib M(1).Author information: (1)School of Pharmacy, The University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan.(2)Hamdi Mango Center for Scientific Research, The University of Jordan, Amman11942, Jordan.Essential (volatile) oil from aerial parts of Tamarix aphylla (L.) H.Karst.(Tamaricaceae) grown wild in Jordan was hydrodistilled by Clevenger apparatus andanalyzed by means of GC and GC-MS techniques. In vitro screening of potentialcytotoxicity of the aqueous (AE) and ethanol (EE) extracts was also evaluatedagainst human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), and pancreatic carcinoma (Panc-1) cancer cell lines as well as normal humanfibroblasts. GC-MS analysis of T. aphylla EO revealed its richness innonterpenoid nonaromatic hydrocarbons (52.39%), with predominance of6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone as the principal component. Biologically, theplant extracts exhibited cytotoxicity effects in dose-dependent manner againstmost of the tested cell lines, but potent effects were only predicted againstMCF-7 cells with IC50 values of 2.17 ± 0.10 and 26.65 ± 3.09 μg/mL for T. aphyllaAE and EE, respectively. T. aphylla AE demonstrated a comparable cytotoxic effectwith that offered by the control drug cisplatin (IC50 value of 1.17 ± 0.13μg/mL), even with higher safety profile against normal fibroblast cells (IC50values of T. aphylla AE versus cisplatin: 79.99 ± 4.90 versus 9.08 ± 0.29 μg/mL).T. aphylla extracts could be a valuable source for cytotoxic agents with highsafety and selective cytotoxicity profiles. Unfortunately, no antiproliferativepotential against Caco-2 or Panc-1 cancer cell lines was detected at aconcentration less than 30 μg/mL.DOI: 10.1155/2018/9363868 PMCID: PMC6032978PMID: 30034503
