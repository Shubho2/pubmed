This practice hasbeen greatly beneficial in the improvement of the patient's quality of life buthas also led to the increased use of radiotherapy and associated soft-tissuesarcomas, with angiosarcoma being the most common malignancy.Radiation-associated angiosarcoma (RAS) of the breast is a rare phenomenon, whichhas been reported to occur in approximately 0.9 out of 1,000 cases, with areported onset as late as 23 years following radiotherapy. Here we report 2 casesof RAS that occurred within 6 and 13 years following radiotherapy of theirprimary breast lesion. We discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic challengesregarding this disease and review the current literature. This case report servesas cautionary lessons on the importance of considering RAS of the breast in thedifferential diagnosis during evaluation for recurrent breast neoplasms. Ongoing clinical trials using combinations of vascular endothelial growth factorinhibitors and chemotherapy may provide future avenues of treatment for thisdifficult-to-treat disease.DOI: 10.1159/000488314 PMCID: PMC5968252PMID: 29805371
