It would therefore be expected that cancer prevention organizations wouldincorporate these facts into their public stance on the consumption of alcohol.The aims of this study were to: (1) assess how national cancer societies indeveloped English-speaking countries [i.e. English-speaking countries belongingto the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)] communicatealcohol-related cancer risk to the public and (2) compare whether theseorganization's advocacy of increased alcohol taxes is in line with their advocacyof tobacco tax increases to reduce cancer risk.METHODS: We searched the websites of the following national cancer organizations for all statements related to the relationship between alcohol consumption andcancer risk: Cancer Council Australia, Canadian Cancer Society, Irish CancerSociety, Cancer Society New Zealand, Cancer Research UK and the American CancerSociety. A categorical system was developed to code the qualitative data forhealth statements, alcohol consumption recommendations, and tax policyrecommendations. Websites were analyzed in March of 2017.RESULTS: All organizations, with the exception of the American Cancer Society andCanadian Cancer Society, state that alcohol is a group 1 carcinogen and that evenlow-level alcohol consumption increases risk for some cancers. Additionally,while the American Cancer Society supports increasing tobacco taxes through itscancer action network, it has not advocated for increased alcohol taxes inrelation to support for tobacco tax increases.CONCLUSION: Analysis in 2017 of the websites for national cancer societies inAustralia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates-including Cancer Council Australia, the Canadian Cancer Society, the IrishCancer Society, Cancer Society New Zealand, Cancer Research UK and the AmericanCancer Society-shows that only the American Cancer Society and Canadian CancerSociety websites fail to state that alcohol is a group 1 carcinogen and can causecancer at low doses, and that there is no safe threshold for cancer risk.Â© 2018 Society for the Study of Addiction.DOI: 10.1111/add.14254 PMID: 29696713
