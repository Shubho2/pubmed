But the mechanism of iron accumulation in the tumor microenvironmentis still unclear. Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumormicroenvironment may act as extra iron source. However, evidence is still lackingin TAMs as iron donors. In the present study, we found that iron concentrationwas significantly increased at tumor metastatic stage, which could be attributed to up-regulated expression of lipocalin2 (Lcn2). TAMs in the microenvironmentsecreted Lcn2. Moreover, TAMs increased intracellular iron concentration in tumorcells via Lcn2 as transporter, which could be restored by Lcn2 antibodyneutralization. In conclusion, TAMs increased intracellular iron concentration ofthe tumor cells via Lcn2 which acted as an iron transporter. Targeting Lcn2secretion in TAMs to "starve cancer cells" could act as alternative option fortumor therapy.PMCID: PMC5943609PMID: 29755643
