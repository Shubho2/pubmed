However, resistance remainsproblematic largely due to enhanced cross-talk between ER and growth factorpathways, circumventing the need for steroid hormones. Previously, we reportedthe anti-proliferative effect of everolimus (RAD001-mTORC1 inhibitor) withendocrine therapy in resistance models; however, potential routes of escape from treatment via ERBB2/3 signalling were observed. We hypothesised that combinedtargeting of three cellular nodes (ER, ERBB, and mTORC1) may provide enhancedlong-term clinical utility.METHODS: A panel of ER+ BC cell lines adapted to long-term oestrogen deprivation (LTED) and expressing ESR1 wt or ESR1 Y537S , modelling acquired resistance to anaromatase-inhibitor (AI), were treated in vitro with a combination of RAD001 and neratinib (pan-ERBB inhibitor) in the presence or absence of oestradiol (E2),tamoxifen (4-OHT), or fulvestrant (ICI182780). End points included proliferation,cell signalling, cell cycle, and effect on ER-mediated transactivation. Anin-vivo model of AI resistance was treated with monotherapies and combinations toassess the efficacy in delaying tumour progression. RNA-seq analysis wasperformed to identify changes in global gene expression as a result of theindicated therapies.RESULTS: Here, we show RAD001 and neratinib (pan-ERBB inhibitor) caused aconcentration-dependent decrease in proliferation, irrespective of the ESR1mutation status. The combination of either agent with endocrine therapy furtherreduced proliferation but the maximum effect was observed with a triplecombination of RAD001, neratinib, and endocrine therapy. In the absence ofoestrogen, RAD001 caused a reduction in ER-mediated transcription in the majorityof the cell lines, which associated with a decrease in recruitment of ER to anoestrogen-response element on the TFF1 promoter. Contrastingly, neratinibincreased both ER-mediated transactivation and ER recruitment, an effect reduced by the addition of RAD001. In-vivo analysis of an LTED model showed the triplecombination of RAD001, neratinib, and fulvestrant was most effective at reducing tumour volume. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the addition ofneratinib negated the epidermal growth factor (EGF)/EGF receptor feedback loopsassociated with RAD001.CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the combination of therapies targeting ERBB2/3 and mTORC1 signalling, together with fulvestrant, in patients who relapse onendocrine therapy and retain a functional ER.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0983-1 PMCID: PMC5992820PMID: 29880014
