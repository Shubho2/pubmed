[Epub ahead of print]IDO expression in breast cancer: an assessment of 281 primary and metastaticcases with comparison to PD-L1.Dill EA(1), Dillon PM(2), Bullock TN(1), Mills AM(3).Author information: (1)University of Virginia Department of Pathology, Charlottesville, Virginia,USA.(2)University of Virginia Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology &Oncology, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.(3)University of Virginia Department of Pathology, Charlottesville, Virginia,USA. amm7r@virgnia.edu.The immune inhibitory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has beenassociated with immune evasion in numerous malignancies and may mark thesecancers as susceptible to anti-IDO therapies. We herein address IDO expression inbreast cancers, examine the relationship between IDO and PD-L1, and investigateIDO fidelity across breast cancer primaries and metastases. IDO and PD-L1expression was assessed in tissue microarrays containing 242 invasive primarybreast cancers, 20 nodal metastases, and 19 distant metastases. IDO and PD-L1were scored by extent in the tumor cells and immune infiltrate. Tumor IDOstaining was seen in 14% of primaries including 38% of triple-negative cancers.IDO immune cell staining was seen in 14% of primaries and 29% of triple-negative cancers. Tumoral IDO and PD-L1 co-expression was seen in 8% of primaries,including 70% of tumoral PD-L1-positive cases. Immune IDO and PD-L1 co-expressionwas identified in 14% of primaries, including 48% of immune PD-L1-positive cases.Tumoral and immune cell IDO was conserved in 94% of matched primary/metastasis.In summary, IDO expression is common among high-grade, triple-negative breastcancers and is frequently associated with PD-L1 co-expression, suggesting thatIDO might be a mechanism of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy resistance and thatdual therapy may be of utility. Tumoral and immune cell IDO expression showsfidelity between primary and metastatic sites in treatment-na√Øve cancers, arguingagainst IDO as an independent driver for metastatic spread. Clinical trials areneeded to assess the efficacy of IDO inhibition relative to IDO expression, aswell as its possible role in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy.DOI: 10.1038/s41379-018-0061-3 PMID: 29802358
