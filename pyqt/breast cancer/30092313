Electronic address:raulhmurillo@yahoo.com.Most evidence on breast cancer screening accuracy derives from high incomecountries. We evaluated screening accuracy and factors related to programimplementation in Bogota, Colombia. Between 2008 and 2012 participants underwent clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography. Positive results underwenthistological verification. Adherence to screening protocols was analyzed.Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were estimated and adjusted byoverdiagnosis. Impact of alternative screening algorithms on follow-up wasexplored, including combined screening tests and modified coding systems formammography. In total, 7436 women aged 50-69 were enrolled; 400 discontinued and 1003 non-compliant with screening protocols. 23 cancer cases were diagnosed.Mammography sensitivity and specificity were 78.3% (95%CI 77.3-99.3) and 99.4%(95%CI 99.2-99.6). CBE sensitivity was 39.1% (95%CI 37.9-40.3) and specificity83.4% (95%CI 82.6-84.3). Parallel mammography and CBE showed the highestsensitivity (95.6%) and combined as serial tests the lowest (positive CBEfollowed by mammography 13.0%). A simplified coding system for mammography(recall/no-recall) had 6.3% of positive results and a minor reduction inspecificity compared with standard mammography, but reported the best balancebetween recall rates and screening protocol compliance. Call-backs had high ratesof loss-to-follow-up; thus, alternative screening algorithms might help increase screening compliance and follow-up in low and middle income countries,particularly in populations with poor screening history and low access to health services.Copyright © 2018.
