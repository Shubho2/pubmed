George.ward@astx.com.(2)Astex Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, United Kingdom.Because of their roles in the evasion of apoptosis, inhibitor of apoptosisproteins (IAP) are considered attractive targets for anticancer therapy.Antagonists of these proteins have the potential to switch prosurvival signaling pathways in cancer cells toward cell death. Various SMAC-peptidomimetics withinherent cIAP selectivity have been tested clinically and demonstrated minimalsingle-agent efficacy. ASTX660 is a potent, non-peptidomimetic antagonist ofcIAP1/2 and XIAP, discovered using fragment-based drug design. The antagonism of XIAP and cIAP1 by ASTX660 was demonstrated on purified proteins, cells, and invivo in xenograft models. The compound binds to the isolated BIR3 domains of bothXIAP and cIAP1 with nanomolar potencies. In cells and xenograft tissue, directantagonism of XIAP was demonstrated by measuring its displacement from caspase-9 or SMAC. Compound-induced proteasomal degradation of cIAP1 and 2, resulting indownstream effects of NIK stabilization and activation of noncanonical NF-κBsignaling, demonstrated cIAP1/2 antagonism. Treatment with ASTX660 led toTNFα-dependent induction of apoptosis in various cancer cell lines in vitro,whereas dosing in mice bearing breast and melanoma tumor xenografts inhibitedtumor growth. ASTX660 is currently being tested in a phase I-II clinical trial(NCT02503423), and we propose that its antagonism of cIAP1/2 and XIAP may offerimproved efficacy over first-generation antagonists that are more cIAP1/2selective.
