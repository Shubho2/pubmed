Chest CT showedthat the inferior angle of the scapula protruded into the right intrathoraciccavity. We performed a removal of Mesh. Although we did not want to use syntheticmaterials because of infection, we performed titanium plate fifth rib fixation toavoid the recurrent dislocation of the scapula. After the redo surgery,continuous lavages with physiologic saline of the thoracic cavity was alsoperformed. Patient is now doing well without recurrences of cancer, infection andscapular dislocation, 14 months after the redo surgery.DOI: 10.1093/jscr/rjy178 PMCID: PMC6055544PMID: 30046443
