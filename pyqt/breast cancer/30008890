China.AR-42 is a member of a novelly discovered class of phenylbutyrate-derived histonedeacetylase inhibitors, and has a number of antitumor effects in a variety oftumor types; however, the role of AR-42 and its possible mechanisms have not beenreported in the treatment of breast cancer. The aim of the present study was toinvestigate the antitumor effects of AR-42 and its associated mechanisms inbreast cancer. MTT assays and colony formation assays were conducted to measurethe proliferation of MCF-7 cells, and flow cytometry was used to analyze cellapoptosis. The results revealed that AR-42 induced cell apoptosis and suppressed cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Mechanistically, AR-42treatment increased the acetylation of the p53 protein and prolonged thehalf-life of the p53 protein; furthermore, AR-42 treatment upregulated p21 andPUMA expression. Notably, AR-42 had a synergistic effect on MCF-7 cells incombination with fluorouracil, which is one of the most commonly usedchemotherapeutic agents. In conclusion, the results indicated that AR-42 inhibitsbreast cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, indicating that AR-42 is a potential therapeutic agent.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8854 PMCID: PMC6036490PMID: 30008890
