Therefore, we clarified theinfluence of interventions by pharmacists during counseling of patients withcancer on patients' quality of life.Methods: To determine this influence, we conducted a survey to assess the qualityof life of 39 patients with breast cancer who underwent their initial course ofoutpatient cancer chemotherapy at Gifu Municipal Hospital. A quality of lifesurvey was conducted before the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd courses of treatment and wasbased on a method obtained from a survey paper entitled, "Quality of LifeQuestionnaire for Cancer Patients Treated with Anticancer Drugs."Results: Twenty patients were assigned to the intervention group, which received pharmacist counseling, and nineteen patients were assigned to thenon-intervention group, which received no pharmacist counseling. Both groups werecompared immediately before the 1st course and 2nd course. Regarding the subscaleof social relationships, a significant difference was observed for malaise(p = 0.043), with the non-intervention group experiencing them to a greaterdegree than the intervention group. Regarding the change between immediatelybefore the 1st course and the 3rd course, a significant difference was observedin the subscale of social relationships for nausea (p = 0.017), with thenon-intervention group experiencing it to a greater degree than the intervention group.Conclusions: The results suggest that receiving pharmacists' guidance on adverse events and individually adjusted prescriptions tailored to address the occurrenceof adverse events improved the treatment environment and enhanced the quality of life in the intervention group. These findings are beneficial in maintainingpatients' quality of life during cancer treatment.Trial registration: No. UMIN000027171, Registration date: Apr 27, 2017.Retrospectively registered.DOI: 10.1186/s40780-018-0105-3 PMCID: PMC5925838PMID: 29736254
