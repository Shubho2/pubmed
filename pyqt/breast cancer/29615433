In this study, we compared somaticmutations and gene copy number alterations of primary breast cancers and theirmatched metastases from patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative disease.DNA samples obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embeddedER-negative/HER2-positive (n = 9) and ER-, progesterone receptor (PR-),HER2-negative (n = 8) primary breast cancers and from paired brain or skinmetastases and normal tissue were subjected to a hybridization capture-basedmassively parallel sequencing assay, targeting 341 key cancer genes. A largesubset of nonsynonymous somatic mutations (45%) and gene copy number alterations (55%) was shared between the primary tumors and paired metastases. However,mutations restricted to either a given primary tumor or its metastasis, theacquisition of loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type allele, and clonal shifts of genes affected by somatic mutations, such as TP53 and RB1, were observed inthe progression from primary tumors to metastases. No metastasislocation-specific alterations were identified, but synchronous metastases showed higher concordance with the paired primary tumor than metachronous metastases.Novel potentially targetable alterations were found in the metastases relative totheir matched primary tumors. These data indicate that repertoires of somaticgenetic alterations in ER-negative metastatic breast cancers may differ fromthose of their primary tumors, even by the presence of driver and targetablesomatic genetic alterations.Significance: Somatic genetic alterations inER-negative breast cancer metastases may be distinct from those of their primary tumors, suggesting that for treatment-decision making, genetic analyses of DNAobtained from the metastatic lesion rather than from the primary tumor should be considered.
