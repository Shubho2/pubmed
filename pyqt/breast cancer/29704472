This method is on the basis of theperoxidase-like property of DNA templated copper nanoclusters (DNA-CuNCs). Inthis research, it was found that the DNA (poly T) stabilized green emitting CuNCswhich exhibited enzyme-like peroxidase activity. After hybridization of miRNAwith DNA-CuNCs probe and duplex formation, CuNCs catalyzed the oxidation of themethylene blue (MB) substrate, which can interact easily with DNA/miR-155heteroduplex. Applying the optimal conditions, the absorbance of MB decreased by increasing the target miRNA-155 with in a dynamic range from 1.0 pM to 10.0 nMdown to a detection limit (LOD) of 0.6 pM. The DNA-CuNCs/MB complex was designed to develop a facile, cheap, and fast colorimetric assay for detection of miRNAthrough MB oxidation by DNA stabilized CuNCs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
