Case-control,cohort, and meta-analytic studies suggest that women working as flightattendants, in medical professions, some production positions, sales and retail, and scientific technical staff are likely to have elevated risk of breast cancer.In addition, occupational exposures to night-shift work, ionizing radiation, somechemicals, job stress, and sedentary work may increase risk of breast cancer.Occupational physical activity appears to decrease risk. Workplace exposures topassive smoke and occupational exposure to nonionizing radiation do not appear toaffect breast cancer risk. Some studies of occupational categories and workplace exposures indicate that risk may be modified by duration of exposure, timing ofexposure, dose, hormone-receptor subtypes, and menopausal status at diagnosis.The compelling data from this review reveal a substantial need for furtherresearch on occupation and breast cancer.DOI: 10.1177/1048291118758460 PMID: 29658425
