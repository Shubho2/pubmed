HER2 overexpressed in 20-25% of breastcancer signals an aggressive form of breast cancer and is treated withtrastuzumab and pertuzumab.Methods: The patient record database was accessed to identify all postmenopausal women in the Punjab Care hospital who were above 65 years old, with stages 1-3HER2-positive breast cancer and treated with neoadjuvant TCHP and neoadjuvant TCPfrom 2013 till 2016.Results: In TCH-P group and TCH group, mild fatigue (34% versus 36%) and diarrhea(48% versus 49%) were most common toxicities. Fever in TCH-P group and TCH group (12% versus 13%) was common. Anorexia affected 21% and 16% of patients receiving TCH and TCHP regimen, respectively. Febrile neutropenia was higher in TCH-P group13% (3/23) versus 4.5% (1/22) in TCH group. Also 27.2% (6/22) of TCH-P group was hospitalized for treatment related toxicities versus 21.7% (5/23) of TCH group.Conclusion: Comparing neoadjuvant TCP and neoadjuvant TCH-P showed TCH-P regimen had an acceptable toxicity profile. Severe cardiac dysfunction was not observed. Using TCH-P regimen can be considered as relatively safe therapeutic option forelderly postmenopausal women with nonmetastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6106041 PMCID: PMC5933036PMID: 29850259
