BCtissue is characterized by distinctive miRNA signatures associated with cancerdevelopment or progression.METHODS: We explored miRNA profiles from BC tissues by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Functional analysis was based on miRNA-mRNA data integration and GeneSet Enrichment Analysis.RESULTS: Partition of miRNA expression data from BC samples of Chinese Han andCaucasian subjects identified clusters of correlated miRNAs that were subjectedto a global and integrative analysis aimed at identifying novel associations withbiological and clinical value. Co-expression of miRNAs clustered in the samemodule was partially explained by co-transcription of the same genomic locus orinvolvement in similar biological functions. No significant associations werefound among miRNA clusters and clinical-pathological variables, except for ERstatus and immune infiltration estimated by CIBERSORT. A large number of miRNAclusters, instead, were significantly differentially expressed in PAM 50 andextracellular matrix (ECM) subgroups. Specifically, a new cluster includingseveral relatively new miRNAs was overexpressed in ECM3 tumors, characterized by increased epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). An integrative approach to extract meaningful relationships on miRNA/mRNA networks and predict thefunctional role of the miRNA clusters indicates that immune system, ECM,proliferation, transcription and DNA repair were the biological functions moretargeted by miRNAs aberrantly expressed in BC.CONCLUSIONS: We then identified novel miRNA patterns associated with BC molecularfeatures, and described a complex regulatory network where miRNAs belonging tothe same module cooperate in finely tuning gene expression.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
