In the present study, the method andthe potential application of ctDNA in the diagnosis of breast cancer wereexplored. DNA was extracted from the tumor tissues, plasma and peripheral bloodcells of 11 patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer. Primers weredesigned against the exons of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate 3-kinasecatalytic subunit α, p53, epidermal growth factor receptor, Akt and phosphataseand tensin homolog. The amplicon-based method for whole-exon sequencing wasperformed. The associations between the ctDNA mutant frequency with the tumor DNAmutant frequency, and the ctDNA concentration with clinical data were analyzed. Alinear association was identified between the concentration of ctDNA and thetumor volume for the 3 patients with basal-like breast cancer, and not in othersubtypes. The mutation frequency differed the least between ctDNA and tissue DNA in basal-like breast cancer. ctDNA retained the constituent ratio of genemutations identified in the corresponding tumor tissue. The ctDNA detection rate depended to a certain extent on the mutation frequency in tumor tissue; forexample, a mutant locus with a mutation frequency of >30% in tissues presented a detection rate of >40% in plasma samples, whereas a locus with a mutationfrequency of <10% in tissue was associated with a detection rate of ≤1% in theplasma. Therefore, ctDNA may reflect the mutations observed in cancer. Comparedwith other subtypes, ctDNA may be a more sensitive biomarker for the assessmentof mutation and cancer burden in basal-like breast cancer relative to othersubtypes.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8224 PMCID: PMC5920267PMID: 29725452
