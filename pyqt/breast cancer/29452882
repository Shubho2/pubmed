Electronic address:Christine.oconnor@dit.ie.Regioisomers of the functional group of the main ligand (L) on a series of[Ru(phen)2L]2+and [Ru(bpy)2L]2+ complexes, where phen is 1,10 phenanthroline and bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine, were synthesised to investigate the interaction withdeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as potential therapeutics. UV-Vis binding titrations,thermal denaturation and circular dichroism were used to evaluate theirinteraction with DNA. The conclusions indicated the significance of the auxiliaryligand; especially 1,10-phenanthroline has on the binding constants (Kb). Thesystematic variation of auxiliary ligand(phen or bpy), and polypyridyl ligand(4-(1H-Imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthrolin-2-yl)benzonitrile (CPIP),2-(4-formylphenyl)imidazo[4,5-f] [1,10] phenanthroline (FPIP),2-(4-bromophenyl)imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline (BPIP) and2-(4-nitrophenyl)imidazo[4,5-f] [1,10] phenanthroline (NPIP), split in terms offunctional group change were investigated for DNA interaction. The CPIP analoguesin particular were investigated for the regioisomerism (ortho, meta, para) effectof the nitrile group on the ligand. It was found that both the DNA interactioncould be tailored through the systematic variation of the electronic nature ofthe individual auxiliary ligand and to a lesser extent the functional group andregioisomeric change. Preliminary cell line studies have been carried out todetermine the selectivity of the complexes against cell lines such as A375 (Skin Cancer), HeLa (Cervical Cancer), A549 (Lung Cancer), Beas2B (Lung Normal Cell)and MCF-7 (Breast Cancer). Complexes which had strong DNA interactions in thebinding studies have proven to be the most efficacious against certain celllines. Establishing well-defined structure property relationships when looking attrends in spectroscopic properties and DNA binding will aid in the intelligentdesign of potential therapeutic complexes.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
