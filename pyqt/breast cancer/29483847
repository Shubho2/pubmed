Exon 2 is one of the important exons to bind CD44 protein tohyaluronan. Experimental evidences show that hyaluronan-CD44 interactionintensifies the proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells.Therefore, the current study aimed at investigating the association betweenspecific polymorphisms in exon 2 and its flanking region of CD44 withpredisposition to breast cancer.Methods: In the current study, 175 Iranian female patients with breast cancer and175 age-matched healthy controls were recruited in biobank, Breast CancerResearch Center, Tehran, Iran. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of CD44 exon 2 andits flanking were analyzed via polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencingtechniques. Association between the observed variation with breast cancer riskand clinico-pathological characteristics were studied. Subsequently,bioinformatics analysis was conducted to predict potential exonic splicingenhancer (ESE) motifs changed as the result of a mutation.Results: A unique polymorphism of the gene encoding CD44 was identified atposition 14 nucleotide upstream of exon 2 (A37692→G) by the sequencing method.The A > G polymorphism exhibited a significant association with higher-grades of breast cancer, although no significant relation was found between thispolymorphism and breast cancer risk. Finally, computational analysis revealedthat the intronic mutation generated a new consensus-binding motif for thesplicing factor, SC35, within intron 1.Conclusions: The current study results indicated that A > G polymorphism wasassociated with breast cancer development; in addition, in silico analysis withESE finder prediction software showed that the change created a new SC35 binding site.DOI: 10.1186/s12935-018-0522-2 PMCID: PMC5824488PMID: 29483847
