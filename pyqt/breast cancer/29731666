This study aims to explore the association of two FOXP3 polymorphisms (rs3761548 and rs3761549) with susceptibility to breastcancer (BC).Method: A case-control study was conducted, involving 560 patients and 583healthy individuals from the Chinese Han population. The genotypes of FOXP3polymorphisms were detected using the Sequenom MassARRAY method. The association between FOXP3 polymorphisms and BC risk was evaluated using a Ï‡2 test with anodds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) under six genetic models. False-positive report probability was utilized to examine whether the significantfindings were noteworthy.Results: We observed that rs3761548 was associated with a higher BC risk inheterozygous, dominant, overdominant, and allele genetic models (CA vs CC: OR=1.32, P=0.031; CA/AA vs CC: OR =1.32, P=0.023; CA vs CC/AA: OR =1.29, P=0.042; Avs C: OR =1.26, P=0.029), whereas no significant association was found betweenrs3761549 and BC risk. In addition, CA, CA/AA genotype, and A allele of rs3761548were related to larger tumor size, and the A allele was also correlated with apositive status of Her-2 in BC patients.Conclusion: Our study suggests that FOXP3 polymorphism rs3761548 is associatedwith BC susceptibility in the Chinese and may be involved in tumor progression.Future studies are needed to confirm the results in a larger population with moreraces.DOI: 10.2147/CMAR.S158433 PMCID: PMC5927342PMID: 29731666
