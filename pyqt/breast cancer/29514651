The increase was driven by DCIS andearly breast cancer as the incidence of locally advanced and metastatic breastcancer remained stable. Between 1990 and 2014, ten-year overall survival ratesincreased from 87% to 93% for early breast cancer, 41% to 62% for locallyadvanced- and from 6% to 9% for metastatic disease. Annually, breast cancer inthe Netherlands is responsible for approximately 3100 deaths, 26,000 life yearslost, 65,000 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and an economic burden ofâ‚¬1.27 billion.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the burden ofbreast cancer and subsequent trends over time in the Netherlands.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4158-3 PMCID: PMC5842550PMID: 29514651
