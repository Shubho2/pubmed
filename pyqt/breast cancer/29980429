Electronicaddress: edward.chow@sunnybrook.ca.Radiotherapy (RT) for breast cancer improves survival, but poses risk to theheart, resulting from a linear relationship between RT dose and heart disease.This review presents studies worldwide reporting heart doses from whole breast RTafter 2014 to update a previous systematic review (Taylor et al, Int J RadiatOncol Biol Phys, 2015) in order to determine patterns of current heart dosimetry among varying RT regimens. Studies published between January 2014 and September2017 were included if they reported whole heart dose based on whole breast RTtechnique or treatment position and had a sample size of ≥ 20 patients. Studiesreporting brachytherapy, proton RT only, or boost to tumor bed were excluded.Among 99 studies, whole heart dose was reported by 231 regimens. The mean heartdose for left-sided breast cancer, reported by 84 studies (196 regimens), was 3.6Gy, compared with a review of those previously reported (5.4 Gy). Regimensemploying breathing control in any position had a significantly lower mean heart dose (1.7 Gy) compared with regimens without breathing control (4.5 Gy) (P <.0001). The mean heart dose varied significantly between continents (P < .0001), with heterogeneity reported among countries within Europe (P = .04) although not within other continents. On average, the mean heart dose steadily decreasedbetween 2014 (4.6 Gy) and 2017 (2.6 Gy) (P = .003). Other heart dose parametersincluding the mean dose to the left anterior descending artery were reported by80 left-sided regimens, and the mean left anterior descending artery dose was12.4 Gy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
