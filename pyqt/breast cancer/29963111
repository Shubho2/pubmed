Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & ResearchInstitute, Tampa, USA.Purpose: Alcohol consumption is associated with an increase in breast cancerrisk, but findings on the association of alcohol with survival after breastcancer diagnosis have been inconsistent. Further, whether these associationscould differ by adjuvant hormone therapy status is unknown. We examinedinteractions between alcohol consumption and adjuvant hormone therapy in relationto breast cancer-free survival among women with a primary breast cancerdiagnosis.Methods: Participants in this study included 1,399 women diagnosed with primarybreast cancer between 2007 and 2012 at the Moffitt Cancer Center. Alcoholconsumption during the year preceding diagnosis was assessed in a patient survey.Information on tumor characteristics, breast cancer treatment and outcomes wasavailable from the Moffitt Cancer Registry. Associations were examined using Cox proportional hazards models in stratified analyses by adjuvant hormone therapystatus, after adjustment for potential confounders.Results: Overall, alcohol consumption was associated with significantly improved breast cancer-free survival (any vs. none: hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95%confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.92). Among women without adjuvant hormonetherapy, alcohol consumption was associated with better survival in heavydrinkers (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43-0.93). Among women with adjuvant hormonetherapy, survival was better in women consuming alcohol as compared tonondrinkers (moderate: HR, 0.69, 95% CI, 0.51-0.93; heavy: HR, 0.74, 95% CI,0.57-0.96; any: HR, 0.71, 95% CI, 0.57-0.87). There was no significantinteraction between alcohol and adjuvant hormone therapy (p-interaction=0.54 for alcohol modeled as none or any and p=0.34 for alcohol modeled as none, moderate, and heavy).Conclusion: Associations of alcohol consumption with breast cancer-free survival are similar in women with and without adjuvant hormone therapy. Future studiesare warranted to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the observed inverseassociations.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.2.158 PMCID: PMC6015986PMID: 29963111
