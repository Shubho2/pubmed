Besides, their influences onpolymorphism changes were observed.METHODS: Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed andCD24-/CD44+ cells were sorted from breast cancer cells and recognized as BCSCs.Microarray was applied to search for the differentially expressed miRNAs andmRNAs between MCF7 and BCSCs. The aberrant expression of miR-422a and PLP2 wasfurther confirmed by RT-qPCR and the direct targeted relationship was verified bydual-luciferase reporter assay. After in vitro transfection, the expression ofmiR-422a and PLP2 were manipulated and biological functions of BMSCs werecompared with CCK-8, colony formation and sphere formation assay. Thetumorigenesis ability of transfected BMSCs was also investigated in NOD/SCIDtumor mice models.RESULTS: BMSCs were successfully established from MCF7 cells and miR-422aexpression was downregulated while PLP2 level decreased in BMSCs. MiR-422adirectly targets the 3'UTR of PLP2 and suppressed its expression. Besides, theup-regulation of miR-422a contributed to weakened ability of proliferation andmicrosphere formation of BMSCs, while PLP2 overexpression facilitated thosebiological abilities. Tumorigenesis of BMSCs in mice models was impaired byeither overexpression of miR-442a or silencing of PLP2.CONCLUSION: Up-regulation of miR-422a attenuated microsphere formation,proliferation and tumor formation of breast cancer stem cells via suppressing thePLP2 expression.DOI: 10.1080/15384047.2018.1433497 PMCID: PMC5915044 [Available on 2019-03-30]PMID: 29509055
