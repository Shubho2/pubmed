However, there is littlescientific evidence about their bioactivities. This study was designed to examinethe anti-tumor and anti-metastasis effects of honey bee larvae powder (HLP) andexplore the underlying mechanism. A subcutaneous transplantation model (murinebreast cancer cell 4T1-LUC) and lung metastasis model (murine melanoma cellB16-F10) were established to evaluate the anti-tumor and anti-metastasis effects of HLP. Honey bee larvae powder extract (HLE) was obtained by 70% ethanolextraction, and its chemical composition was determined according tophysiochemical methods. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was performed to test thecytotoxicity of HLE, and qRT-PCR assays were conducted to examine the mRNA levelsof tumor marker EZH2 in HLE-treated tumor cells. In vivo xenograft tumor assaysin BALB/c mice revealed dose-dependent suppression of tumor growth and lungmetastasis showing an inhibition rate of 37.5% and 70.4% at 6 g/kgHLP-administered group with no toxicity to the animals. In vitro studiesindicated that HLE showed no cytotoxicity to cancer cells at doses up to1000 μg/mL, however, it significantly decreased EZH2 mRNA levels in HLE(1000 μg/mL)-treated B10-F10 cells (28.49%) and 4T1-LUC cells (26.75%). Furtherstudies to elucidate the mechanisms involved and to isolate the active componentsof honey bee larva may provide more valuable information for its development and application in cancer treatment.Copyright © 2018.
