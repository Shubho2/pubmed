However, thoseestimates are valid only if large sample sizes are used. We propose a Bayesiancovariance component model (BCCM) that takes into account the genetic correlationamong phenotypes and genetic correlation among individuals. The use of the BCCMallows us to circumvent issues related to small sample sizes, includingoverfitting and boundary estimates. Using expression of genes in breast cancerpathway, obtained from the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER)project, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the accuracy of SNP-basedheritability estimates over univariate and likelihood-based methods. According tothe BCCM, except CHURC1 (h2 = 0.27, credible interval = (0.2, 0.36)), all tested genes have trivial heritability estimates, thus explaining why recent progress intheir eQTL identification has been limited.DOI: 10.1038/s41431-018-0100-z PMCID: PMC5945852 [Available on 2019-05-01]PMID: 29440776
