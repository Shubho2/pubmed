We aimed to investigate the combined effect of estrogen-related lifestyle factors onpostmenopausal breast cancer risk.METHODS: Data from 27,153 women enrolled in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, andOvarian Cancer Screening Trial were used. We created an estrogen-relatedlifestyle score (ERLS) by incorporating a previously developed measure ofestrogenic diet, alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity.The scores ranged from 0 to 6 with alcohol and BMI accounting for higher weights than the other factors. To evaluate the preventive possibilities of a lowestrogen-related lifestyle and to be consistent with other published lifestylescores, higher scores were set to correspond with potentially lower estrogeniclifestyle. The association between the ERLS and incident breast cancer wasexamined using Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: Participants with an ERLS of 4 or ≥ 5 had a 23% (HR 0.77; 95% CI0.67-0.89) and 34% (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.56-0.78) lower risk of breast cancer,respectively, compared to those with an ERLS ≤ 2 after multivariable adjustment. Estimates were similar when restricting to invasive cases or estrogenreceptor-positive subtypes. No single lifestyle component appeared to drive theassociation.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the combined effect of a lifestylecharacterized by a low estrogenic diet, low alcohol consumption, low body weight,and high levels of physical activity are associated with a reduction inpostmenopausal breast cancer risk, possibly through an influence on estrogenmetabolism.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4784-0 PMCID: PMC6026043 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29651647
