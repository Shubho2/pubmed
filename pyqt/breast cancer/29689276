Electronicaddress: trygve@uab.edu.Little is known about the effects of combinatorial dietary compounds on theregulation of epigenetic mechanisms involved in breast cancer prevention. Thehuman diet consists of a multitude of components, and there is a need toelucidate how certain compounds interact in collaboration. Withaferin A (WA),found in the Indian winter cherry and documented as a DNA methyltransferase(DNMT) inhibitor, and sulforaphane (SFN), a well-known histone deacetylase (HDAC)inhibitor found in cruciferous vegetables, are two epigenetic modifying compoundsthat have only recently been studied in conjunction. The use of DNMT and HDACinhibitors to reverse the malignant expression of certain genes in breast cancer has shown considerable promise. Previously, we found that SFN + WAsynergistically promote breast cancer cell death. Herein, we determined thatthese compounds inhibit cell cycle progression from S to G2 phase in MDA-MB-231and MCF-7 breast cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this unique combinationof epigenetic modifying compounds down-regulates the levels of Cyclin D1 andCDK4, and pRB; conversely, the levels of E2F mRNA and tumor suppressor p21 areincreased independently of p53. We find these events coincide with an increase inunrestricted histone methylation. We propose SFN + WA-induced breast cancer cell death is attributed, in part, to epigenetic modifications that result in themodulated expression of key genes responsible for the regulation of cancer cellsenescence.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
