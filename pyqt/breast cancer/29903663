Kokusaginine isolated from Dictamnus dasycarpus Turcz.has been reported to show cytotoxicity in several human cancer cell linesincluding breast cancer cells MCF-7. In this study, kokusaginine showed thepotent inhibitory effect on MCF-7 multidrug resistant subline MCF-7/ADR andMDA-MB-231 multidrug resistant subline MDA-MB-231/ADR. Kokusaginine markedlyinduced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in MCF-7/ADR cells.Furthermore, kokusaginine reduced P-gp mRNA and protein levels, and suppressedP-gp function especially in MCF-7/ADR cells. In addition, kokusaginine showed to inhibit tubulin assembly and the binding of colchicine to tubulin by bindingdirectly to tubulin and affects tubulin formation in vitro. Taken together, theseresults support the potential therapeutic value of kokusaginine as an anti-MDRagent in chemotherapy for breast carcinoma.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
