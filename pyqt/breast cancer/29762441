Previous studies comparedthe incidence of high-risk lesions in resection specimens between these 2 groups.However, no studies have compared incidental findings in breast reductionspecimens based on relative risk of cancer. Our study stratifies lesions byrelative risk of malignant progression and compares the frequency of thesefindings in bilateral versus unilateral reduction mammoplasties.METHODS: Charts were reviewed from 422 patients undergoing breast reductions by asingle surgeon over a 10-year period. Age, procedure, specimen weight, andhistologic findings were recorded. Pathologic data were stratified by relativerisk of malignant progression and compared between patients with and withoutcancer histories.RESULTS: Three hundred five patients underwent bilateral reduction mammoplastyand 117 patients underwent unilateral reduction mammoplasty over the 10-yearperiod. Bilateral patients had a higher incidence of benign lesions (P = 0.02).Both groups had similar incidences of proliferative lesions (P = 0.48).Unilateral patients had a higher incidence of atypia (P = 0.05) and carcinoma in situ (P < 0.01). One unilateral patient had an incidentally found invasivecarcinoma.CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing unilateral reduction after oncologic resectionhave a higher incidence of high-risk lesions compared with those undergoingbilateral reductions for macromastia. Although others have compared incidentalfindings between these cohorts, no group has compared these incidental findingsstratified by risk. Our data underscore the importance of pathologic analysis of reduction specimens for early detection of high-risk lesions and will provevaluable for preoperative counseling before reduction mammoplasty for either ofthese indications.DOI: 10.1097/SAP.0000000000001482 PMID: 29762441
