Electronic address: zhlwgq@126.com.Multidrug resistance (MDR) has become a very serious problem in cancer therapy.To effectively reverse MDR in tumor treatments, a new pH-sensitive nano drugdelivery system (NDDS) composed of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) andd-a-tocopheryl poly-ethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) copolymers wassynthesized to deliver doxorubicin (DOX) into drug-resistant breast cancer cellline (MCF-7/ADR). DOX@MSNs-TPGS were characterized to have a single peak sizedistribution, high DOX loading efficiency and a pH-dependent drug releaseprofile. MSNs-TPGS were internalized via caveolae, clathrin-mediated endocytosis and energy-dependent cellular uptake. The DOX@MSNs-TPGS exhibited 10-foldenhanced cell killing potency compared to free DOX and DOX@MSNs. The enhanced MDRreversal effect was ascribed to the higher amount of cellular uptake ofDOX@MSNs-TPGS in MCF-7/ADR cells than that of free DOX and DOX@MSNs, as a result of the inhibition of P-gp mediated drug efflux by TPGS. In vivo studies of NDDSin tumor-bearing mice showed that DOX@MSNs-TPGS displayed better efficacy againstMDR tumors in mice and reached the tumor site more effectively than DOX andDOX@MSNs, with minimal toxicity. These results suggest DOX@MSNs-TPGS developed inthis study have promising applications to overcome drug resistance in tumortreatments.Copyright Â© 2017.
