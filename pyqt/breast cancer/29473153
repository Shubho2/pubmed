In rodent models, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) systemregulates involution of the mammary gland. We examined associations ofcirculating IGF measures with TDLU involution in normal breast tissues amongwomen without precancerous lesions. Among 715 Caucasian and 283 African American (AA) women who donated normal breast tissue samples to the Komen Tissue Bankbetween 2009 and 2012 (75% premenopausal), serum concentrations of IGF-I andbinding protein (IGFBP)-3 were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay. Hematoxilyn and eosin-stained tissue sections were assessed for numbers ofTDLUs ("TDLU count"). Zero-inflated Poisson regression models with a robustvariance estimator were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) for association of IGF measures (tertiles) with TDLU count by race and menopausal status, adjusting for potential confounders. AA (vs. Caucasian) women had higher age-adjusted mean levels of serum IGF-I (137 vs. 131 ng/mL, p = 0.07) and lower levels of IGFBP-3(4165 vs. 4684 ng/mL, p < 0.0001). Postmenopausal IGFBP-3 was inverselyassociated with TDLU count among AA (RRT3vs.T1  = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.28-0.84,p-trend = 0.04) and Caucasian (RRT3vs.T1 =0.64, 95% CI = 0.42-0.98,p-trend = 0.04) women. In premenopausal women, higher IGF-I:IGFBP-3 ratios wereassociated with higher TDLU count in Caucasian (RRT3vs.T1 =1.33, 95%CI = 1.02-1.75, p-trend = 0.04), but not in AA (RRT3vs.T1 =0.65, 95%CI = 0.42-1.00, p-trend = 0.05), women. Our data suggest a role of the IGFsystem, particularly IGFBP-3, in TDLU involution of the normal breast, a breastcancer risk factor, among Caucasian and AA women.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31333 PMCID: PMC6019124 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29473153
