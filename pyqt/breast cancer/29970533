Thepresent multicenter, phase II, single-arm study assessed the efficacy and safety of a first-line regimen of eribulin plus trastuzumab for untreated advanced ormetastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Enrolled patients received eribulin (1.4 mg/m2intravenously; I.V.) on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle, an initial trastuzumabdose (8 mg/kg I.V.) on day 1, and 6 mg/kg of trastuzumab on day 1 of eachsubsequent cycle. The primary endpoint was the response rate (RR). The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), durationof response (DOR), and safety. Twenty-eight patients (median age: 62.5 years)received a median of 12 (range: 2-53) cycles of eribulin plus trastuzumab.RESULTS: The RR was 53.6% [complete response (CR), 4; partial response (PR), 11] with a median PFS of 344 days. The clinical benefit rate was 64.0%. Grade 3/4adverse events were observed in 12 (42.9%) patients. For details, neutropenia in 8 (28.6%) patients, peripheral neuropathy in 2 (7.1%) patients, interstitialpneumonia in 1 (3.6%) patient, ALT elevation in 1 (3.6%) patient, osteonecrosisof the jaw in 1 (3.6%) patient, and fatigue in 1 (3.6%) patient. The patient withosteonecrosis received denosumab, too. No symptomatic congestive heart failurewas observed.CONCLUSION: Combination therapy of eribulin plus trastuzumab is acceptable inefficacy and safety, and a capable option for first-line advanced or recurrentHER2-positive breast cancer.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12697 PMID: 29970533  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
