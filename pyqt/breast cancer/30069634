J.H.Veelken@lumc.nl.Idelalisib (GS-1101, CAL-101, Zydelig®) is an orally bioavailable, small-moleculeinhibitor of the delta isoform (p110δ) of the enzyme phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K). In contrast to the other PI3K isoforms, PI3Kδ is expressed selectively inhematopoietic cells. PI3Kδ signaling is active in many B-cell leukemias andlymphomas. By inhibiting the PI3Kδ protein, idelalisib blocks several cellularsignaling pathways that maintain B-cell viability. Idelalisib is the first PI3Kinhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Treatment withidelalisib is indicated in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Thisreview presents the preclinical and clinical activity of idelalisib with a focus on clinical studies in CLL.DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-91439-8_12 PMID: 30069634
