Statistical image reconstruction (SIR) methods have the potential toreduce through-plane artifacts in DBT, and thus may be used to further reduceanatomical clutter. The purpose of this work was to study the impact of SIR onanatomical clutter in the reconstructed DBT image volumes.METHODS: An SIR with a slice-wise total variation (TV) regularizer wasimplemented to reconstruct DBT images which were compared with the clinicalreconstruction method (filtered backprojection). The artifact spread function(ASF) was measured to quantify the reduction of the through-plane artifacts levelin phantom studies and microcalcifications in clinical cases. The anatomicalclutter was quantified by the anatomical noise power spectrum with a power lawfitting model: NPSa ( f) = α f-β . The β values were measured from thereconstructed image slices when the two reconstruction methods were applied to a cohort of clinical breast exams (N = 101) acquired using Hologic SeleniaDimensions DBT systems.RESULTS: The full width half maximum (FWHM) of the measured ASF was reduced from 8.7 ± 0.1 mm for clinical reconstruction to 6.5 ± 0.1 mm for SIR which yields a25% reduction in FWHM in phantom studies and the same amount of ASF reduction wasalso found in clinical measurements from microcalcifications. The measured βvalues for the two reconstruction methods were 3.17 ± 0.36 and 2.14 ± 0.39 forthe clinical reconstruction method and the SIR method, respectively. Thisdifference was statistically significant (P << 0.001). The dependence of β onslice location using either method was negligible.CONCLUSIONS: Statistical image reconstruction enabled a significant reduction of both the through-plane artifacts level and anatomical clutter in the DBTreconstructions. The β value was found to be β≈2.14 with the SIR method. Thisvalue stays in the middle between the β≈1.8 for cone beam CT and β≈3.2 formammography. In contrast, the measured β value in the clinical reconstructions(β≈3.17) remains close to that of mammography.© 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/mp.12864 PMID: 29542821
