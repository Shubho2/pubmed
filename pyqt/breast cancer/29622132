In the era of personalized medicine, these imagingtechniques give clinicians insight into cancer pathobiology and allows them toindividualize treatment regimens. Breast MR imaging has gained acceptance forbreast cancer evaluation; work is ongoing on validation of MBI for breast cancer evaluation. This article discusses clinical applications of breast MR imaging andMBI, and compares the performance of these techniques in breast cancer screening,diagnosis, staging, and treatment response evaluation.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.
