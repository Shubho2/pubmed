Ronzoni, Via Colombo 81, 20133 Milano, Italy.In this study, we aimed to investigate in vitro whether the synthetized indiummaltolate (InMal) and gallium maltolate (GaMal) could exert either a toxic effecttoward breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 or an agonistic activity withmitoxantrone (MTX) in comparison to fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3. Both GaMal and InMal reduced viability of MDA-MB-231, and at a lesser extent of NIH3-T3, in adose- and time-dependent mode, the outcome was more effective in comparison toMTX sole exposure. Both GaMal and InMal toxicity was reverted by iron citrateaddition on NIH3-T3, not on MDA-MB-231, showing indirectly that gallium andindium's mechanisms of action may include iron targeting. The agonistic activity against MDA-MB-231 survival was shown pretreating with 100 μM InMal for 24 hfollowed by medium exchange with MTX at 10 ng mL-1 or vice-versa but not withco-incubation of both compounds. In particular, InMal pretreating resulted moreprotective to MTX subsequent exposure.DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b02026 PMCID: PMC6044947PMID: 30023897
