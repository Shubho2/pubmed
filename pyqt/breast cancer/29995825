Eighty-five breastcancer patients verified by pathology and immunohistochemistry underwent DCE-MRI examination. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the DCE-MRIfeatures [the strengthening types, shape, distribution, edge, internalreinforcement and the time-signal intensity curve (TIC) types] and the 4immunohistochemical markers (ER, PR, Her-2, and Ki-67) by GraphPad InStat version6.0 software. The enhanced morphology types, shapes, edge had significantcorrelation with the expression of ER (P = .001, P = .000, P = .001,respectively), PR (P = .045, P = .015, P = .000, respectively) and Ki-67(P = .039, P = .000, P = .024, respectively), and no significant correlation withHer-2 expression (P = .906, P = .074, P = .679, respectively) was observed. Therewas significant correlation between internal enhancement patterns and Ki-67expression (P = .004), and no significant correlation between internalenhancement patterns and the expression of ER, PR, and Her-2 (P = .208, P = .682,P = .437, respectively) was observed. TIC had significant correlation with ER,Ki-67 expressions (P = .022, P = .001, respectively), and no correlation withexpressions of PR and Her-2 (P = .128, P = .391, respectively) was observed. The DCE-MRI features of breast cancer were well correlated with the expression ofimmunohistochemistry, and might also be helpful to evaluate the biologicalprogress and prognosis.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011530 PMID: 29995825  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
