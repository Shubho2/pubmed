The aim of this study was to compare a well-established CTC detection method based on immunomagnetic isolation with a new,filtration-based platform.METHODS: In this prospective study, two 7.5 ml blood draws were obtained from 60 MBC patients and CTC enumeration was assessed using both the CellSearch® and the newly developed filtration-based platform. We analyzed the correlation ofCTC-positivity between both methods and their ability to predict prognosis.Overall survival (OS) was calculated and Kaplan-Meier curves were estimated with thresholds of ≥1 and ≥5 detected CTCs.RESULTS: The CTC positivity rate of the CellSearch® system was 56.7% and of thefiltration-based platform 66.7%. There was a high correlation of CTC enumeration obtained with both methods. The OS for patients without detected CTCs, regardlessof the method used, was significantly higher compared to patients with one ormore CTCs (p < 0.001). The median OS of patients with no CTCs vs. ≥ 1 CTCassessed by CellSearch® was 1.83 years (95% CI: 1.63-2.02) vs. 0.74 years (95%CI: 0.51-1.52). If CTCs were detected by the filtration-based method the medianOS times were 1.88 years (95% CI: 1.74-2.03) vs. 0.59 years (95% CI: 0.38-0.80).CONCLUSIONS: The newly established EpCAM independently filtration-based system isa suitable method to determine CTC counts for MBC patients. Our study confirmsCTCs as being strong predictors of prognosis in our population of MBC patients.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4115-1 PMCID: PMC5819661PMID: 29463222
