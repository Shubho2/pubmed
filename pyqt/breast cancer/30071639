As part of a continuing search for bioactiveconstituents from Korean medicinal plant sources, phytochemical analysis of theaerial portion of L. cuneata led to the isolation of two new lignan glycosides(1,2) along with three known lignan glycosides (3⁻7) and nine known flavonoidglycosides (8⁻14). Numerous analysis techniques, including 1D and 2D NMRspectroscopy, CD spectroscopy, HR-MS, and chemical reactions, were utilized forstructural elucidation of the new compounds (1,2). The isolated compounds wereevaluated for their applicability in medicinal use using cell-based assays.Compounds 1 and 4⁻6 exhibited weak cytotoxicity against four human breast cancer cell lines (Bt549, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and HCC70) (IC50 < 30.0 μM). However, noneof the isolated compounds showed significant antiviral activity against PR8,HRV1B, or CVB3. In addition, compound 10 produced fewer lipid droplets in Oil RedO staining of mouse mesenchymal stem cells compared to the untreated negativecontrol without altering the amount of alkaline phosphatase staining.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23081920 PMID: 30071639
