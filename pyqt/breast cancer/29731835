China.MicroRNA (miR)-146a-5p functions as a tumor suppressor in various types ofcancer. However, the role of miR-146a-5p in the development of triple-negativebreast cancer (TNBC) is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the role of miR-146a-5p in TNBC. The expression level of miR-146a-5p in TNBC tissues andcell lines was initially detected using reverse transcription-quantitativepolymerase chain reaction. To predict the target gene of miR-146a-5p, TargetScan software was used and a dual luciferase assay was performed to verify theprediction. Furthermore, in order to explore the role of miR-146a-5p in TNBC,miR-146a-5p was overexpressed in TNBC cells using miR-146a-5p mimics. An MTTassay was performed to detect cell proliferation, and a Transwell assay wasconducted to determine cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, western blottingwas performed to measure associated protein expression. It was revealed thatmiR-146a-5p was downregulated in TNBC tissues and cell lines. SOX5 was indicated to be a target gene of miR-146a-5p and was upregulated in TNBC cells.Additionally, miR-146a-5p could inhibit TNBC cell proliferation, migration andinvasion, repress the expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin andfibronectin) and increase epithelial marker (E-cadherin) expression. Furthermore,SOX5 overexpression eliminated the effects of miR-146a-5p mimics on TNBC cells.In conclusion, the data of the present study indicated that miR-146a-5p inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of TNBC cells by regulating SOX5.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2018.5945 PMCID: PMC5920859PMID: 29731835
