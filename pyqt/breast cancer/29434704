The role of fatty acids, particularly of a diet rich in ω-3 and ω-6polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in breast cancer development is not fullyunderstood and remains controversial due to their complex mechanism of action.However, a large number of animal models and cell culture studies havedemonstrated that high levels of ω-3 PUFAs have an inhibitory role in thedevelopment and progression of breast cancer, compared to ω-6 PUFAs. The present review focused on recent studies regarding the correlation between dietary PUFAs and breast cancer development, and aimed to emphasize the main molecularmechanisms involved in the modification of cell membrane structure and function, modulation of signal transduction pathways, gene expression regulation, andantiangiogenic and antimetastatic effects. Furthermore, the anticancer role ofω-3 PUFAs through the modulation of microRNA expression levels was also reviewed.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2017.5515 PMCID: PMC5776638PMID: 29434704
