PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for eligible studies through September 26, 2017. Atotal of 20 studies involving 2,323 patients were analyzed, and the data wereindependently extracted by two researchers. The combined hazard ratios (HRs) with95% CI was used to assess the association between survival data and plasmamammaglobin A expression, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were used to assessthe associations between clinicopathological parameters and plasma mammaglobin A expression. The results indicated that plasma mammaglobin A expression was apredictor of poor prognosis for breast carcinoma patients, with an HR of 2.08(95% CI=1.48-2.91; P<0.0001) for overall survival. Moreover, plasma mammaglobin Awas significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (OR=2.00; 95%CI=1.17-3.45; P=0.01) and advanced tumor stage (OR=3.01; 95% CI=1.57-5.77;P=0.0009) in breast carcinoma patients. However, the results revealed that plasmamammaglobin A was not significantly associated with tumor size (OR=1.29; 95%CI=0.46-3.66; P=0.63), tumor differentiation (OR=0.99; 95% CI=0.63-1.57; P=0.97),menopausal status (OR=0.75; 95% CI=0.48-1.18; P=0.22), estrogen receptor status(OR=0.78; 95% CI=0.44-1.36; P=0.38), progesterone receptor status (OR=0.76; 95%CI=0.57-1.02; P=0.07), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status(OR=1.12; 95% CI=0.78-1.59; P=0.54). In conclusion, the results demonstrate that positive plasma mammaglobin A expression might serve as a biomarker of poorprognosis for breast carcinoma patients.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S156556 PMCID: PMC5985781PMID: 29881297
