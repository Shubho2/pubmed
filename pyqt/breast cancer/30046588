Its histological feature to spread in rows of single cell layers explains why it often fails to form a palpable lesion and the lack of sensitivity ofmammography and ultrasound (US) to detect it. It also has a higher incidence ofmultifocal, multicentric, and contralateral disease when compared to the otherhistological subtypes. The clinicopathologic features and outcomes of InvasiveDuctolobular Carcinoma (IDLC) are very similar to the ILC. The purpose of ourstudy is to assess the importance of MRI in the preoperative management andstaging of patients affected by ILC or IDLC.Materials and Methods: We identified women diagnosed with ILC or IDLC. Weselected the patients who had preoperative breast MRI. For each patient weidentified the areas of multifocal, multicentric, or contralateral disease notvisible to standard exams and detected by preoperative MRI. We analyzed thepotential correlation between additional cancer areas and histological cancermarkers.Results: Of the 155 women who met our inclusion criteria, 93 (60%) had additionalcancer areas detected by MRI. In 61 women, 39,4% of the overall population, theadditional cancer areas were confirmed by US/tomosynthesis second look andbiopsy. Presurgical MRI staging changed surgical management in the 37,4% of thepatients. Only six patients of the overall population needed a reoperation after the initial surgery. No statistically significant correlation was found betweenMRI overestimation and the presence of histological peritumoral vascular/linfaticinvasion. No statistically significant correlation was found between additionalcancer areas and histological cancer markers.Conclusions: Our study suggests that MRI is an important tool in the preoperativemanagement and staging of patients affected by lobular or ductolobular invasivecarcinoma.DOI: 10.1155/2018/1569060 PMCID: PMC6038675PMID: 30046588
