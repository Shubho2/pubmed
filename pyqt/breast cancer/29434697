China.Breast cancer is one of the most lethal cancers affecting women worldwide and wasestimated to account for ~30% of all new cancer diagnoses in women. Althoughavailable evidence has proved the tumor suppressor role of genistein in cancer,the underling mechanisms have remained to be fully elucidated. S-phasekinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) has been revealed to critically enhance thepathogenesis of multiple human cancers. The present study determined whethergenistein exerts its anti-tumor function by suppressing Skp2 in breast cancercells. Genistein significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion andmigration of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, genistein treatment also inducedmarked apoptosis and a typical cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. Mechanistically, genistein treatment was identified to cause a significant downregulation of Skp2.Two crucial tumor suppressors, p21 and p27, were upregulated in genistein-treatedbreast cancer cells. The present results revealed that genistein exerted itstumor suppressor effect at least partially via inhibition of Skp2 and promotionof its downstream targets p21 and p27. Therefore, inactivation of Skp2 bygenistein may be a promising approach for breast cancer treatment.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2017.5489 PMCID: PMC5772955PMID: 29434697
