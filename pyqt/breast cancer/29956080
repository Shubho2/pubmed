Systematic characterization of morphology and transcriptome duringnormal breast development lays the foundation of our understanding of canceretiology. We examined mammary glands in female Sprague Dawley rats across sixdevelopmental stages - pre-pubertal, peri-pubertal, pubertal, lactation, adultparous and adult nulliparous. We investigated histology by Hematoxylin and Eosin and Mallory's Trichrome stain, proliferative and apoptotic rate byimmunohistochemistry and whole-transcriptome by microarrays. We identifieddifferentially expressed genes between adjacent developmental stages by linearmodels, underlying pathways by gene ontology analysis and gene networks and hubs active across developmental stages by coexpression network analysis. Mammarygland development was associated with large-scale changes in the transcriptome;particularly from pre-pubertal to peri-pubertal period and the lactation periodwere characterized by distinct patterns of gene expression with unique biologicalfunctions such as immune processes during pre-pubertal development andcholesterol biosynthesis during lactation. These changes were reflective of theshift in mammary gland histology, from a rudimentary organ during early stages toa secretory organ during lactation followed by regression with age. Hub geneswithin mammary gene networks included metabolic genes such as Pparg during thepre-pubertal stage and tight junction-related genes claudins and occludins inlactating mammary glands. Transcriptome profile paired with histology enhancedour understanding of mammary development, which is fundamental in understandingthe etiologic mechanism of breast cancer, especially pertaining to windows ofsusceptibility to environmental exposures that may alter breast cancer risk.DOI: 10.1007/s10911-018-9401-7 PMID: 29956080
