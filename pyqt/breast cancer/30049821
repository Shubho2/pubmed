Scores of adherence to these recommendations can be calculated at theindividual level. Here, we investigated the associations between four nutritionalscores and overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer risk in a largeprospective population-based cohort: the cancer-specific World Cancer ResearchFund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) score, the AlternateHealthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010), a score based on adherence to theMediterranean diet (MEDI-LITE), and the French National Nutrition HealthProgram-Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). This study included 41,543 participants aged≥40 years from the NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-2017). A total of 1,489 overallincident cancers were diagnosed. A one-point increment of the WCRF/AICR score wassignificantly associated with decreased overall [12%; 95% confidence interval(CI), 8%-16%; P < 0.0001], breast (14%; 95% CI, 6%-21%; P = 0.001), and prostate (12%; 95% CI, 0%-22%; P = 0.05) cancer risks. Hazard ratio for colorectal cancer risk was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.72-1.03; P = 0.09). The PNNS-GS score was associatedwith reduced colorectal cancer risk (P = 0.04) and AHEI-2010 was associated with reduced overall cancer risk (P = 0.03). The WCRF/AICR score performed best.Compared with other tested scores, it included a stronger penalty for alcohol,which is a major risk factor for several cancer sites. Better adherence tonutritional recommendations, especially those designed for cancer prevention,could substantially contribute to decreased cancer incidence.Significance: Thislarge prospective population-based cohort study suggests that following dietaryrecommendations such as the ones proposed by the World Cancer ResearchFund/American Institute for Cancer Research could significantly contribute tocancer prevention.
