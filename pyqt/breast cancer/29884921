We will also provide an update regarding mechanisms of action andresistance to PARPi, and review clinical trials of PARPi as monotherapy or incombination regimens. PARPi are a novel treatment approach in persons withgBRCA1/2m-associated MBC. Going forward, the clinical applicability of thesecompounds outside the gBRCAm setting will be studied in greater detail. Theidentification of accurate predictive biomarkers of response is a researchpriority.DOI: 10.1007/s11912-018-0709-7 PMID: 29884921
