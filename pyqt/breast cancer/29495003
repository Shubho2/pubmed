In this study, we investigatedwhether BMP receptor type 1a (BMPR1a) can alter the interaction betweenmetastatic cancer cells and osteoclast precursors.METHODS: Adenovirus-mediated RNA interference was used to interrupt target genes of human breast cancer cell lines and nude mice were injected intratibially with the cancer cells. Tumor-bearing mice were examined by bioluminescence imaging andmicroCT. Sections of metastatic legs were measured by a series of stainingmethods. Murine bone marrow mononuclear cells or RAW264.7 cells were culturedwith conditioned media of breast cancer cells. RT-PCR, Western blotting and ELISAwere used to test mRNA and protein expressions of target molecules.RESULTS: Expression of BMPR1a of MDA-MB-231-luc cells at tumor-bone interface wasapparently stronger than that of cancer cells distant from the interface. Miceinjected with BMPR1a-knockdown MDA-MB-231-luc cells showed reduced tumor growthand bone destruction compared with control groups. Knockdown (KD) of BMPR1a ofMDA-MB-231-luc cells or MCF-7 cells decreased the level of receptor activator forNF-κB ligand (RANKL). Level of RANKL in MDA-MB-231-luc cells or MCF-7 cells wasreduced by p38 inhibitor. Compared with control group, knockdown of p38 of breastcancer cells decreased cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis.CONCLUSION: Knockdown of BMPR1a of breast cancer cells suppresses theirproduction of RANKL via p38 pathway and inhibits cancer-inducedosteoclastogenesis, which indicates that BMPR1a might be a possible target inbreast cancer-induced osteolytic metastasis.© 2018 The Author(s).
