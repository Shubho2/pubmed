The aim of this study was toinvestigate the association between gout drugs use and risk of cancer.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective longitudinal population-based case-control study in Taiwan. Cases were identified all patients who were aged 20years orabove, and had a first time diagnosis of cancers for the period between 2001 and 2011. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) werecalculated by using conditional logistic regression.RESULTS: We examined 601,733 cases and 2,406,932 matched controls. The adjustedodd ratio for any gout drugs use and overall cancer risk was 1.007 (95% CI:0.994-1.020). There was a significant risk of leukemia (AOR: 1.34, 95% CI:1.20-1.50), endometrial cancer (AOR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.12-1.57), non-Hodgkin's(AOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.13-1.35), female breast cancer (AOR: 1.21, 95% CI:1.13-1.29), cervical cancer (AOR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.07-1.37). However, noassociation was observed in male group (AOR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.98) but female showed a significantly increased risk of cancer at any site (AOR: 1.107, 95% CI: 1.08-1.13).CONCLUSION: In summary, our results suggest that gout drugs increase risk of the most common cancers, particularly in leukemia, non-Hodgkin's, endometrial, breastand cervical cancer.Copyright © 2018 Société française de rhumatologie.
