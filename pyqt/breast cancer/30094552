[Epub ahead of print]Racial disparities in chemotherapy administration for early-stage breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Green AK(1), Aviki EM(2), Matsoukas K(2), Patil S(2), Korenstein D(2), BlinderV(2).Author information: (1)Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY, 10065,USA. greena@mskcc.org.(2)Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY, 10065,USA.PURPOSE: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to measure the extentto which race is associated with delayed initiation or receipt of inadequatechemotherapy among women with early-stage breast cancer.METHODS: We performed a systematic search of all articles published from January 1987 until June 2017 within four databases: PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, andCochrane CENTRAL. Eligible studies were US-based and examined the influence ofrace on chemotherapy delays, cessation, or dose reductions among women with stageI, II, or III breast cancer. Data were pooled using a random effects model.RESULTS: A total of twelve studies were included in the quantitative analysis.Blacks were significantly more likely than whites to have delays to initiation ofadjuvant therapy of 90 days or more (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06-1.87; X² = 31.05,p < 0.00001; I² = 90%). There was no significant association between race andchemotherapy dosing. Due to overlap between studies assessing the relationshipbetween race and completion of chemotherapy, we conducted two separate analyses. Black patients were significantly more likely to discontinue chemotherapy,however, this was no longer statistically significant when larger numbers ofpatients with more advanced (stage III) breast cancer were included.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that black breast cancer patients experienceclinically relevant delays in the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy more often than white patients, which may in part explain the increased mortality observedamong black patients.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4909-5 PMID: 30094552
