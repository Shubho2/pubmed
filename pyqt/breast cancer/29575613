We have previously reported that fibroblastgrowth factor 1 played pivotal roles in cancer development and generated a mouse scFv (mscFv1C9) could effectively prohibit cancer cell proliferation in vitro andin vivo. Here, we further humanized this scFv (hscFv1C9) using a structure-guidedcomplementarity determining region grafting strategy. The purified hscFv1C9maintained similar antigen-binding affinity and specificity as mscFv1C9, and itwas capable of inhibiting growth of different tumours in vitro and in vivo. Thesedata strongly suggested that hscFv1C9 has antitumour potentials.© 2018 The Authors.
