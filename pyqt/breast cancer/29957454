A relatedhydrophobic [Fe8] cluster conjugated with 5 kDa hyaluronic acid (HA) wascharacterized by 57Fe-Mössbauer and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, and wasevaluated in aqueous solutions in vitro with regard to its contrast enhancingproperties [r2 = 3.65 mM s-1 (1.3 T), 26.20 mM s-1 (7.2 T) and 52.18 mM s-1(11.9 T)], its in vitro cellular cytotoxicity towards A-549 cells and COS-7 cellsand its in vivo enhancement of T2-weighted images (4.7 T) of a human breastcancer xenografted on a nude mouse. The physiologically compatible [Fe8]-HAconjugate was i.v. injected to the tumor-bearing mouse, resulting in observable, heterogeneous signal change within the tumor, evident 15 min after injection and persisting for approximately 30 min. Both molecular [Fe8] and its HA-conjugateshow a strong magnetic field dependence on r2, rendering them promising platformsfor the further development of T2 MRI contrast agents in high and ultrahighmagnetic fields.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
