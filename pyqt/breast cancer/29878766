Herein, we investigated the anticancer effect on breastcarcinoma of daucosterol linoleate (DL), a steroid isolated from sweet potato. DLinhibited the cell viability of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 breastcancer cells at an IC50 value of 53.27 ± 9.02 μg/mL, while the effect was modest in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Flow cytometry indicated that the DL-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells is dose-dependent. However, DL inhibitedtumor growth and tumor weight at 100 mg/kg in MCF-7 xenograft nude mice. DLdiminished the expression of Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, and XIAP, while increasing Bax, Bad, and activated caspase-dependent apoptosis in tumor tissues. Furthermore, DLinactivated the upstream Pi3k/Akt/NF-κB pathway. In the 4T1 spontaneousmetastasis model, DL blocked metastasis progression, decreased the number ofvisible metastasis foci and inhibited metastasis size distribution in lungtissue. Further studies showed that DL suppressed VEGF, MMP 2, and MMP 9expression in both tumor and lung tissues. From these results, we can assume thatDL is a potential adjuvant therapy for ER-positive breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jafc.8b01387 PMID: 29878766  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
