However, knowledge gaps existregarding how best to communicate IRA results and support women at increased riskin future health care decisions, in part because patients conceptualize and make meaning of risk differently from the medical community. Better understanding the views of low-income women of color identified as being at increased risk forbreast cancer can inform efforts to conduct IRA in an ethical and respectfulmanner. We conducted in-depth interviews with 13 low-income African American and Latina women who receive care at a federally qualified health center (FQHC) andhad recently learned of their increased risk for breast cancer. These interviews explored their experience of the IRA process, their interpretation of what being at increased risk means, and their reactions to provider recommendations. Eightkey themes were identified. We conclude with recommendations for theimplementation of IRA for breast cancer in underserved primary care settings.DOI: 10.1353/nib.2018.0023 PMID: 29657180
