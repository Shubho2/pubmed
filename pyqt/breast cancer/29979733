The CoMPaS is the original mathematical model and the corresponding softwarebuilt by modelling the natural history of the primary tumor (PT) and secondarydistant metastases (MTS), it reflects the relations between the PT and MTS. TheCoMPaS is based on an exponential growth model and consists of a system ofdeterminate nonlinear and linear equations and corresponds to the TNMclassification. It allows us to calculate the different growth periods of PT and MTS: 1) a non-visible period for PT, 2) a non-visible period for MTS, and 3) avisible period for MTS. The CoMPaS has been validated using 10-year and 15-yearsurvival clinical data considering tumor stage and PT diameter. The following arecalculated by CoMPaS: 1) the number of doublings for the non-visible and visible growth periods of MTS and 2) the tumor volume doubling time (days) for thenon-visible and visible growth periods of MTS. The diameters of the PT andsecondary distant MTS increased simultaneously. In other words, the non-visiblegrowth period of the secondary distant MTS shrinks, leading to a decrease of the survival of patients with breast cancer. The CoMPaS correctly describes thegrowth of the PT for patients at the T1aN0M0, T1bN0M0, T1cN0M0, T2N0M0 and T3N0M0stages, who does not have MTS in the lymph nodes (N0). Additionally, the CoMPaShelps to consider the appearance and evolution period of secondary distant MTS(M1). The CoMPaS correctly describes the growth period of PT corresponding to BC classification (parameter T), the growth period of secondary distant MTS and the 10-15-year survival of BC patients considering the BC stage (parameter M).DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200148 PMCID: PMC6034839PMID: 29979733
