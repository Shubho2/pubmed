[Epub ahead of print]microRNA-98 inhibits the proliferation, invasion, migration and promotesapoptosis of breast cancer cells by binding to HMGA2.Wang MJ(1), Zhang H(1), Li J(1), Zhao HD(2).Author information: (1)The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.(2)The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Chinazhdzhaohaidong@126.com.Breast cancer is a major contributor leading to cancer death in femalesworldwide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects ofmicroRNA-98 (miR-98) on the processes of cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis by binding to HMGA2 in breast cancer. Breast cancer tissues andadjacent normal tissues were collected from 112 patients suffering from breastcancer. The target relationship between miR-98 and HMGA2 was verified by inconnection with the bioinformatics website as well as a dual-luciferase reporter assay, both of which provided evidence indicating that HMGA2 was a target gene ofmiR-98. Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with miR-98 mimics,miR-98 inhibitors, siRNA-HMGA2 or miR-98 inhibitors + siRNA-HMGA2. MTT assay and flow cytometry methods were performed to determine cell proliferation, cell cycleand apoptosis, respectively, while a Transwell assay was employed to detect cell migration and invasion. Breast cancer tissues exhibited decreased miR-98expression, while increased expression levels of HMGA2 were recorded. The mRNAand protein expressions of HMGA2, cell proliferation, cells at the S phase, cell migration, invasion, expressions of MMP2 as well as MMP9 were all reduced inresponse to miR-98 mimics or siRNA-HMGA2, while a contradictory trend wasobserved in the miR-98 inhibitors group. In conclusion, the results of the study demonstrate that miR-98 inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion,while acting to promote apoptosis by negatively regulating HMGA2 in breastcancer.Â©2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20180571 PMID: 30049846
