We calculated the CharlsonComorbidity Index (CCI) for each patient. We analyzed overall survival (OS),progression free survival (PFS), and acute and late toxicities according to theCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0.RESULTS: A total of 752 patients were included in this study. Median age atdiagnosis was 75 years [70-93.3]. With a median follow-up of 7.3 years[0.4-12.9], OS and PFS at 5 years were 87.2% CI95%[84.8-89.8] and 85.7%CI95%[83.1-88.3], respectively. OS at 5 years was statistically differentaccording to the CCI: 90.7% CI95%[87.6-93.9] for a CCI of 0, 85.8%CI95%[81.8-90.1] for a CCI of 1, and 79.1% CI95%[71.1-87.9] for a CCI ≥ 2(p < 0.01, log-rank test), respectively. Similar results were found for PFS(p < 0.05, log-rank test). Most (23.3%) of the patients had no toxicities; ofthose who experienced side-effects, the majority were grade I or II (96.9%).CONCLUSION: Postoperative RT for non-metastatic BC in older women is effectiveand well-tolerated. Outcome is impacted by age and comorbidities, which are clearindependent prognostic factors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.jgo.2018.02.008 PMID: 29525744
