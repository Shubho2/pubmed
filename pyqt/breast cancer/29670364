SLNBwas conducted on all patients, and 99mTc-PHY or 99mTc-SC was used as theradioactive agent (RA). Axillary lymph node dissections were performed in allpatients post SLN dissections.Results: The detection rate of 99mTc-PHY group was higher compared with that of99mTc-SC group (p=0.023), but no difference in the detection rate by dye alone(p=0.190) or by RAs alone (p=0.615) was found between the two groups, and thenumber of identified SLNs (p=0.100), number of identified SLNs by dye alone(p=0.161), and number of identified SLNs by RA alone (p=0.242) were similarbetween the two groups. In addition, the sensitivity, specificity, false-negativerate, false-positive rate, and accuracy rate of SLNB showed no difference between99mTc-PHY and 99mTc-SC groups (sensitivity: p=0.645; specificity: p=0.511;false-negative rate: p=0.645; false-positive rate: p=0.511; accuracy rate:p=0.464).Conclusion: Our study revealed that 99mTc-PHY was qualified to be a convincingradiopharmaceutical in SLNB.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S155265 PMCID: PMC5894685PMID: 29670364
