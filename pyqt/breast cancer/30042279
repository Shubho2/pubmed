The diagnosis was T1N0M0scirrhous carcinoma that was estrogen receptor-positive, progesteronereceptorpositive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative. After 3 years 10 months, during which the patient underwent adjuvant therapy with oralaromatase inhibitors, she developed bilateral multiple lung metastases. Thesewere treated with the anticancer agents anthracycline and taxane. Progressivedisease(more and larger lung metastases)was diagnosed in April 2013, andbevacizumab plus paclitaxel combination therapy was started. After completion of 4 courses, a lung abscess appeared, which was conjectured to represent rapidtumor necrosis that had become infected. As several tumors remained solid evenafter the lung abscess improved, the patient received 18 courses of eribulinmonotherapy. Computed tomography in April 2016 revealed only patches of linear orcord-like scarring in both lungs, with no metastatic or recurrent foci. In thiscase, a patient with recurrent breast cancer responded to the sequentialadministration of bevacizumab plus paclitaxel combination therapy followed byeribulin monotherapy.PMID: 30042279
