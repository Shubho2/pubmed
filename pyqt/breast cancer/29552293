However, its potential role in supporting endometrial cancer growthand progression has not yet been determined. In this study, we evaluated thevalue of SCD1 as a candidate therapeutic target in human endometrial cancer.Compared with secretory and post-menopausal endometrium, SCD1 was highlyexpressed in normal endometrium of proliferative phase, endometrial hyperplasiaand endometrial carcinoma, while was absent or low expression in non-malignantcontrol stromal cells and adjacent normal endometrium. Knockdown of SCD1significantly repressed endometrial cancer cell growth and induced cellapoptosis. Both short hairpin RNA targeted knockdown and chemical inhibitor ofSCD1 suppressed the foci formation of AN3CA, a metastatic endometrial cell line. Xenograft model further demonstrated that reduced SCD1 expression impairedendometrial cancer growth in vivo. Taken together, these findings indicate thatSCD1 is a potentially therapeutic target in human endometrial cancer. Inhibiting lipid metabolism in cancer cells would be a promising strategy for anti-cancertherapy.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24304 PMCID: PMC5844729PMID: 29552293
