We aimed to assess whether trastuzumab decreases the detection rate ofCirculating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in women with high risk, HER2 non-amplified, earlybreast cancer. Patients and Methods: The EORTC 90091-10093 BIG 1-12 Treat CTC is a phase 2 trial, conducted in 70 hospitals and 6 CTC laboratories across 5European countries. Patients with centrally confirmed HER2 non-amplified breastcancer and ≥1 centrally confirmed CTC per 15mL of blood by CellSearch® following surgery and (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized (1:1) to 6 cycles oftrastuzumab intravenously versus 18 weeks of observation. Randomization wasstratified for center, locally confirmed estrogen receptor (ER) status andadjuvant versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was rate ofdetection of ≥ 1 CTC per 15mL of blood at week 18. Secondary endpoints wereinvasive disease-free survival (iDFS) and cardiac safety.Results: Between 30 April 2013 and 17 October 2016, 1317 patients were screened; 95 (7.2%) had detectable CTC(s), and 63 (4.8%) were randomized to trastuzumab(n = 31) or observation (n = 32). Fifty-eight patients were evaluable for theprimary endpoint, 29 in each arm. In 9 of the 58 patients, CTC(s) were stilldetected at week 18: 5 in the trastuzumab and 4 in the observation arm (one-sidedFisher exact test, p = 0.765). An Independent Data Monitoring Committeerecommended stopping further accrual for futility for the primary endpoint.Median follow-up at database lock was 13 months (IQR 4-16.5). The 1-year iDFS was93.8% (95% CI 77.3-98.4) in the observation versus 84.8% (95% CI 63.4-94.2) inthe trastuzumab arm. No grade 2-4 cardiac events were observed in the trastuzumabarm.Conclusion: Trastuzumab does not decrease the detection rate of CTCs in HER2non-amplified, non-metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy211 PMID: 29893791
