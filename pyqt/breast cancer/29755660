Since GRexpression can be variable in tumor cells, and virtually all normal mammaliantissues express some GR, we hypothesized that an imaging tool capable ofdetecting GR positive tumors and/or measuring GR occupancy by drug in tumor andnormal tissues could improve the precision application of anti-GR therapies inthe clinic. To this end, we developed a fluorine-18 labeled corticosteroid termedGR02 that potently binds the endogenous ligand binding pocket on full length GR. Binding of 18F-GR02 was suppressed in many normal tissues by co-treatment withmifepristone, a GR antagonist in human use, and was elevated in many normaltissues among mice lacking circulating corticosteroids due to adrenalectomy.18F-GR02 also accumulated in GR positive subcutaneous and subrenal capsuleprostate cancer models, and uptake in tumors was competed by mifepristone.Combined with a straightforward and high yielding radiosynthesis, these dataestablish the foundation for near-term clinical translation of 18F-GR02.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24911 PMCID: PMC5945515PMID: 29755660
