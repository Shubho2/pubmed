Because DCIS is resected after diagnosissimilar to invasive breast cancer, the natural cause and behaviour of DCIS is notwell known. We aimed to determine breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) andoverall survival (OS) according to grade in DCIS patients after surgicaltreatment in the Netherlands.PATIENTS AND METHODS: All DCIS patients diagnosed between 1999 and 2012 wereselected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. The cause of death was obtainedfrom 'Statistics Netherlands'. BCSS and OS were estimated using multivariable Coxregression in the entire cohort and stratified for grades.RESULTS: In total, 12,256 patients were included, of whom 1509 (12.3%) presented with grade I, 3675 (30.0%) with grade II, 6064 (49.5%) with grade III and 1008(8.2%) with an unknown grade. During a median follow-up of 7.8 years, 1138 (9.3%)deaths were observed, and 179 (1.5%) were breast cancer-related. Of these, 10patients had grade I; 46 grade II; 95 grade III and 28 an unknown grade. Afteradjustment for confounding, grade II and III were related to worse BCSS thangrade I with hazard ratios of 1.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97-3.81) and 2.14 (95% CI: 1.11-4.12), respectively. No association between grades and OS was observed.CONCLUSION: BCSS and OS in DCIS patients were excellent. Because superior rateswere observed for low-grade DCIS, it seems justified to investigate whetheractive surveillance may be a balanced alternative for conventional surgicaltreatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
