The major sites for TNBC metastasis include thelungs, brain, liver, and bone. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) arenon-protein-coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides and have been reportedas important regulators in BC metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms for lncRNAs regulating TNBC metastasis are not fully understood. Here we found thatlinc-ZNF469-3 was highly expressed in lung-metastatic LM2-4175 TNBC cells andoverexpression of linc-ZNF469-3 enhanced invasion ability and stemness propertiesin vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, we found linc-ZNF469-3physically interacted with miR-574-5p and overexpression of miR-574-5p attenuatedZEB1 expression. Importantly, endogenous high expressions of linc-ZNF469-3 andZEB1 were correlated with tumor recurrence in TNBC patients with lung metastasis.Taken together, our findings suggested that linc-ZNF469-3 promotes lungmetastasis of TNBC through miR-574-5p-ZEB1 signaling axis and may be used aspotential prognostic marker for TNBC patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0293-1 PMID: 29755127
