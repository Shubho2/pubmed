IL-22 inducesproliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways and production ofanti-microbial molecules that enhance tissue regeneration and host defense. IL-22has also been identified as a cancer-promoting cytokine since deregulation of theIL-22-IL-22R1 system is linked to different cancer entities including lung,breast, gastric, pancreatic and colon cancers. T cells and innate lymphoid cells are the main cellular sources of IL-22. Expression of its specific receptorIL-22R1 is restricted to the non-hematopoietic cells which makes theIL-22-IL-22R1 pathway an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. Fordevelopment of such therapies, a better understanding of IL-22 regulation in the tumor microenvironment is needed. We could recently decipher how cancer cellspromote IL-22 production by memory T cells via induction of IL-1. Here we willdiscuss how this knowledge might contribute to developing therapies disregulatingthe IL-22 pathway for cancer immunotherapy.DOI: 10.1080/21645515.2018.1461300 PMID: 29617184
