High-mobility groupbox protein 1 (HMGB1) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein found in all mammaleukaryotic cells that participates in tumor progression, migration andmetastasis. HMGB1 overexpression has been indicated in breast cancer patients.However, scant information is available regarding the association between HMGB1single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk or prognosis of breastcancer. We report on the association between 4 SNPs of the HMGB1 gene (rs1360485,rs1045411, rs2249825 and rs1412125) and breast cancer susceptibility as well asclinical outcomes in 313 patients with breast cancer and in 217 healthy controls.Patients with one G allele in the rs1360485 or rs2249825 domains are likely toprogress to T2 tumor and lymph node metastasis. In addition, the presence of one G allele in SNPs rs1360485 or rs2249825 was associated with a higher risk ofprogressing to T2 tumor and distant metastasis amongst HER2-enriched andtriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors compared with luminal A and luminal Btumors. Furthermore, having one C allele in the rs1412125 domain increased therisk of pathologic grade 3 disease in HER2-enriched and TNBC tumors. Our results indicate that genetic variations in the HMGB1 gene may serve as an importantpredictor of breast cancer progression and metastasis.DOI: 10.7150/ijms.23462 PMCID: PMC5930459PMID: 29725248
