Electronic address:ed.liu@jax.org.The tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) is a genome-wide instability configuration primarily observed in breast, ovarian, and endometrial carcinomas. Here, westratify TDP tumors by classifying their tandem duplications (TDs) into threespan intervals, with modal values of 11 kb, 231 kb, and 1.7 Mb, respectively.TDPs with ∼11 kb TDs feature loss of TP53 and BRCA1. TDPs with ∼231 kb and ∼1.7Mb TDs associate with CCNE1 pathway activation and CDK12 disruptions,respectively. We demonstrate that p53 and BRCA1 conjoint abrogation drives TDPinduction by generating short-span TDP mammary tumors in genetically modifiedmice lacking them. Lastly, we show how TDs in TDP tumors disrupt heterogeneouscombinations of tumor suppressors and chromatin topologically associating domainswhile duplicating oncogenes and super-enhancers.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).
