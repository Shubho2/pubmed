In addition to overcoming the lowexpression levels of antigenic epitopes on cancer cells, it is also necessary to overcome the inhibitory effect of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) onDC self-antigen presentation. Our group previously demonstrated that calreticulin(CRT) translocated type I transmembrane glycoprotein mucin 1 (MUC1), a breastcancer antigen, to the surface of 4T1 cells, and that treatment withMUC1-CRT-primed 4T1 cell-treated DCs induced apoptosis in a breast cancer cellline. In the present study, cell penetrate peptide, hpp10-DRBD was successfullyused to deliver siRNAs into bone marrow-derived (BM) DCs to constructSOCS1-silenced DCs, which were incubated with MUC1-CRT-primed 4T1 cells, andantigen-specific antitumor immunity was markedly enhanced in vitro and in vivo.These results demonstrated that SOCS1-silencing, combined with MUC1-CRT-primed4T1 cell treatment, may induce increased cytokine production and T cellproliferation by DCs. Furthermore, the in vivo experimental data demonstratedthat the silencing of SOCS1 combined with MUC1-CRT-primed 4T1 treatment of BMDCs may induce enhanced immunological effects. The results of the present study have implications for the development of more effective DC-based tumor vaccines,suggesting that the combination of high tumor-associated antigen expressionlevels on cancer cells with the silencing of a critical inhibitor of DC antigenpresentation may be beneficial.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7477 PMCID: PMC5774391PMID: 29434859
