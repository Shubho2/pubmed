Here, we firstlyprovide new evidence that H19 can induce LIN28B, a conserved RNA binding protein,to accelerate lung cancer growth through sponging miR-196b. Abundance in LIN28Bwas observed in clinical lung cancer samples. A positive link was observedbetween H19 and LIN28B in clinical lung cancer samples. In lung cancer cells, H19was capable of increasing LIN28B expression. Mechanistically, miR-196b directlytargeted LIN28B to inhibit LIN28B expression. H19 was capable of promoting LIN28Bexpression through sequestering miR-196b. Functionally, H19-increased LIN28Bconferred the cell proliferation of lung cancer. Our finding indicates that H19depresses miR-196b to elevate LIN28B, resulting in accelerating cellproliferation in lung cancer.DOI: 10.1080/15384101.2018.1482137 PMID: 29950144
