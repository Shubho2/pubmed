This function of 53BP1 requires interactions with PTIP3 and RIF14-9, the latterof which recruits REV7 (also known as MAD2L2) to break sites10,11. How53BP1-pathway proteins shield DNA ends is currently unknown, but there are twomodels that provide the best potential explanation of their action. In one model the 53BP1 complex strengthens the nucleosomal barrier to end-resectionnucleases12,13, and in the other 53BP1 recruits effector proteins withend-protection activity. Here we identify a 53BP1 effector complex, shieldin,that includes C20orf196 (also known as SHLD1), FAM35A (SHLD2), CTC-534A2.2(SHLD3) and REV7. Shieldin localizes to double-strand-break sites in a 53BP1- andRIF1-dependent manner, and its SHLD2 subunit binds to single-stranded DNA viaOB-fold domains that are analogous to those of RPA1 and POT1. Loss of shieldinimpairs non-homologous end-joining, leads to defective immunoglobulin classswitching and causes hyper-resection. Mutations in genes that encode shieldinsubunits also cause resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition inBRCA1-deficient cells and tumours, owing to restoration of homologousrecombination. Finally, we show that binding of single-stranded DNA by SHLD2 iscritical for shieldin function, consistent with a model in which shieldinprotects DNA ends to mediate 53BP1-dependent DNA repair.DOI: 10.1038/s41586-018-0340-7 PMID: 30022168
