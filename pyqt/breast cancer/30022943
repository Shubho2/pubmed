Here we present a case of a gentlemen initially diagnosed with andtreated for non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma. Genomic profiling of his tumorspecimen revealed a RET point mutation with a known association with medullarythyroid cancer (MTC). Further pathological and molecular diagnostic evaluationconfirmed a diagnosis of MTC, leading to a change in treatment from standardchemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer to targeted therapy against RET andpotential implications regarding inherited cancer risk for his offspring. Thepatient experienced a clinical response to treatment and several months ofimproved quality of life. This case illustrates the capacity of genomic profilingto uncover molecular drivers of disease and help ensure proper diagnosis andmanagement of cancer.DOI: 10.1159/000490238 PMCID: PMC6047557PMID: 30022943
