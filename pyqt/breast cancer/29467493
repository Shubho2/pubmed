However, genome-wide assessment of the overlap inchromatin binding repertoires of these two transcription factors has not beenreported. Here, we show that the AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun interacts withER and that c-Jun chromatin binding shows extensive overlap with ER binding atthe global level. Further, we show that c-Jun overexpression reprograms ERchromatin binding and modulates ER-mediated gene regulation. Our data areconsistent with a mechanism where estrogen/ER-dependent crosstalk with AP-1 atthe transcriptional level is mediated through the tethering of ER to DNA boundAP-1. Additionally, in our system c-Jun overexpression causes reduced sensitivityto tamoxifen in ER+ breast cancer cells. Integrated cistrome, transcriptome, and clinical data reveal TGFBI as a candidate gene which may confer tamoxifenresistance by ER and AP-1 crosstalk. Further, we show that TGFBI expression iselevated in breast cancer compared to normal breast. Together, our data provide anovel genome-wide footprint of ER and AP-1 crosstalk and suggest AP-1 and TGFBIsignaling as potential therapeutic targets in AP-1-overexpressing ER-positivebreast tumors.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0165-8 PMID: 29467493
