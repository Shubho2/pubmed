For patients suffering from lymphedema who are also seeking breast reconstruction, combining an autologous abdominal free flap with a vascularizedinguinal lymph node transfer provides patients the opportunity to have anaesthetic breast reconstruction as well as the potential to improve theirlymphedema in a single operation. The present article aims to provide adescription of the salient features of this approach including the preoperativepreparation, the surgical technique, the postoperative management andcomplications, and a summary of the outcomes.DOI: 10.1055/s-0038-1632402 PMCID: PMC5891653 [Available on 2019-02-01]PMID: 29636652
