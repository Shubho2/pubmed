Inmammals, E2 plays an important role in hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis toregulate puberty onset, however, little is known about the functional role of E2 in teleost pituitary. Using prepubertal grass carp as model, three nuclearestrogen receptors (nERs: estrogen receptor alpha, estrogen receptor beta 1, and estrogen receptor beta 2) and two G protein-coupled estrogen receptors (GPER1:GPER1a and GPER1b) were isolated from grass carp pituitary. Tissue distributionanalysis indicated that both nERs and GPERs were highly detected in grass carppituitary, which suggested that E2 should play an important role in grass carppituitary. Using primary cultured grass carp pituitary cells as model,high-throughput RNA-seq was used to examine the E2-induced differentiallyexpressed genes (DEGs). Transcriptomic analysis showed that E2 couldsignificantly upregulate the expression of 28 genes in grass carp pituitarycells, which were characterized into different functions including reproduction, gonad development, and central nervous system development. Further studiesconfirmed that E2 could induce luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion and mRNA expression in prepubertal grass carp pituitaryin vivo and in vitro. In the pituitary, LH and FSH regulation by E2 were mediatedby both ERβ and GPER1. Apparently, E2-induced LHβ and FSHβ mRNA expression weremediated by adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase A, phospholipase C/inositol1,4,5-triphosphate/protein kinase C, and Ca2+/calmodulin/CaM-dependent proteinkinase II pathways. In addition to LH and FSH, E2 could also induce growthregulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (a novel regulator for pituitarydevelopment) mRNA expression in grass carp pituitary cells. These results, as awhole, suggested that E2 could play an important role in gonadotropin hormonerelease and pituitary development in prepubertal grass carp.DOI: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00308 PMCID: PMC6002485PMID: 29937753
