The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and thechemokine receptor CXCR4 are involved in the metastatic spread of breast cancer. The goal of this study was to develop nanomedicine treatment based on combinedinhibition of STAT3 and CXCR4. We synthesized a library of CXCR4-inhibitingpolymers with a combination of beneficial features that included PEGylation,fluorination, and bioreducibility to achieve systemic delivery of siRNA tosilence STAT3 expression in the tumors. An in vivo structure-activityrelationship study in an experimental lung metastasis model revealed superiorantimetastatic activity of bioreducible fluorinated polyplexes when compared withnonreducible controls despite similar CXCR4 antagonism and the ability to inhibitin vitro cancer cell invasion. When compared with nonreducible and nonfluorinatedpolyplexes, improved siRNA delivery was observed with the bioreduciblefluorinated polyplexes. The improvement was ascribed to a combination of enhancedphysical stability, decreased serum destabilization, and improved intracellulartrafficking. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that fluorination decreased the rateof renal clearance of the polyplexes and contributed to enhanced accumulation in the tumors. Therapeutic efficacy of the polyplexes with STAT3 siRNA was assessed in early stage breast cancer and late-stage metastatic breast cancer with primarytumor resection. Strong inhibition of the primary tumor growth and pronouncedantimetastatic effects were observed in both models of metastatic breast cancer. Mechanistic studies revealed multifaceted mechanism of action of the combinedSTAT3 and CXCR4 inhibition by the developed polyplexes relying both on local and systemic effects.DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.8b01482 PMID: 29985577
