The aim of this article is to define and distinguish high- and moderate-risk breast cancer predisposition genes,summarize the clinical recommendations that may be considered based on theidentification of pathogenic variants (mutations) in these genes, and indicationsfor risk-reducing and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
