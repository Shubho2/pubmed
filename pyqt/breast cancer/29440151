We evaluated the cost-effectivenessof various breast cancer screening scenarios in Canada from a publicly fundedhealth care system perspective using an established breast cancer simulationmodel.METHODS: Breast cancer incidence, outcomes and total health care system costs(screening, investigation, diagnosis and treatment) for the Canadian health care environment were modelled. The model predicted costs (in 2012 dollars),life-years gained and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained for 11 activescreening scenarios that varied by age range for starting and stopping screening (40-74 yr) and frequency of screening (annual, biennial or triennial) relative tono screening. All outcomes were discounted. Marginal and incrementalcost-effectiveness analyses were conducted. One-way sensitivity analyses of keyparameters assessed robustness.RESULTS: The lifetime overall costs (undiscounted) to the health care system for annual screening per 1000 women ranged from $7.4 million (for women aged 50-69yr) to $10.7 million (40-74 yr). For biennial and triennial screening per 1000women (aged 50-74 yr), costs were less, at about $6.1 million and $5.3 million,respectively. The incremental cost-utility ratio varied from $36 981/QALY fortriennial screening in women aged 50-69 versus no screening to $38 142/QALY forbiennial screening in those aged 50-69 and $83 845/QALY for annual screening inthose aged 40-74.INTERPRETATION: Our economic analysis showed that both benefits of mortalityreduction and costs rose together linearly with the number of lifetime screensper women. The decision on how to screen is related mainly to willingness to pay and additional considerations such as the number of women recalled after apositive screening result.Copyright 2018, Joule Inc. or its licensors.DOI: 10.9778/cmajo.20170106 PMCID: PMC5878949PMID: 29440151
