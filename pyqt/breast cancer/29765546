This complex program whereby epithelial tumor cells loosepolarity and acquire mesenchymal phenotype is driven by the regulation ofcell-cell adhesion and cell-substrate interactions. We recently described theassociation of ADAM12 with EMT and we now use immunoprecipitation and proteomicapproaches to identify interacting partners for ADAM12 during EMT. We identifytwenty proteins that are involved in molecular mechanisms associated withadhesion/invasion processes. Integrative network analyses point out the zonulaoccludens protein ZO-1, as a new potential partner for ADAM12. In silicoscreening demonstrates that ZO-1 and ADAM12 are coexpressed in breast cancer celllines sharing EMT signature. We validate the interaction between ZO-1 and ADAM12 in invasive breast cancer cell lines and show that ZO-1 and ADAM12 co-localize inactin- and cortactin-rich structures. Silencing either ADAM12 or ZO-1 inhibitsgelatin degradation demonstrating that both proteins are required for matrixdegradation. We further show that matrix metalloprotease 14, known to mediatedegradation of collagen in invadopodia-like structures interacts with ZO-1.Depletion of PKCε that regulates the recruitment of ADAM12 and ZO-1 to cellmembranes induces a decrease in ADAM12 and ZO-1 at invadopodia-like structuresand degradation activity. Together our data provide evidence for a newinteraction between ADAM12, a mesenchymal marker induced during TGF-β-dependentEMT and ZO-1, a scaffolding protein expressed in tight junctions of epithelialcells, both proteins being redistributed at the invadopodia-like structures ofmesenchymal invasive cells to promote PKCε-dependent matrix degradation.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25106 PMCID: PMC5940405PMID: 29765546
