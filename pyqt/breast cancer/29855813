We examinedtrends in total and OOP health service expenditures overall and by insurancecoverage type among women with metastatic breast cancer.METHODS: We used a longitudinal time series design to examine measures among 5364women with metastatic breast cancer insured by a large US health insurer from2004 to 2011. We measured outcomes during the 12 months after a first identified metastatic breast cancer diagnosis and required women to have at least 6 monthsof prior enrollment. We plotted enrollment measures and adjusted total and OOPspending. We fit trend lines using linear autoregressive models.RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2011, the percentage of women with metastatic breastcancer enrolled in employer-mandated HDHPs increased from 8 to 23% while thepercentage enrolled in employer-mandated low-deductible plans (LDHPs) decreasedfrom 69 to 37%. Over the same time period, estimated annual inflation-adjustedtotal health service spending among women with metastatic breast cancer whoseemployers only offered HDHPs or LDHPS increased from $96,899 to $104,688(increase of $1197 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI]: $47,$2,348).Corresponding OOP spending values among these women with employer-mandateddeductible levels were $4,496 and $5,151 ($91 per year trend; 95% CI -$13,$195). From 2004-2011, women in HDHPs and LDHPs had unchanged annual OOP spending,estimated at of $6642 (95% CI $6,268,$7016) and $4,247 (95% CI $3956,$4538),respectively. Thus, women in HDHPs experienced 55% (44%, 66%) more OOP spendingthan women in LDHP.CONCLUSIONS: OOP spending among women with metastatic breast cancer andemployer-mandated deductible levels was 55% higher among HDHP than LDHP members, and employer-mandated HDHP enrollment increased substantially from 2004 to 2011. Stakeholders and policymakers should design health plans that protect financiallyvulnerable cancer patients from high OOP costs.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4819-6 PMID: 29855813
