Electronic address: rottapel@gmail.com.Successful anti-viral response requires the sustained activation and expansion ofCD8+ T cells for periods that far exceed the time limit of physical T cellinteraction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The expanding CD8+ T cell pool generates the effector and memory cell populations that provide viral clearanceand long-term immunity, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that 3BP2 is recruitedin cytoplasmic microclusters and nucleates a signaling complex that facilitatesMHC:peptide-independent activation of signaling pathways downstream of the TCR.We show that induction of the adaptor molecule 3BP2 is a sensor of TCR signalstrength and is critical for sustaining CD8+ T cell proliferation and regulating effector and memory differentiation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).
