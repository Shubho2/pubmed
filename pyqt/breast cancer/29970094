In this study, anthraquinone derivatives(Compounds 1-5) were evaluated for their anti-cancer potential against variousskin and breast cancer cell lines to assess whether these anthraquinonederivatives may serve as a lead for the augmentation of anti-cancer drug.METHODS: Anthraquinone derivatives,2-methyl-1,3,6-trihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone-3-O-(6'-O-acetyl)-α-rhamnosyl(1 → 2)-β-glucoside (Comp 1), 2-methyl-1,3,6-trihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone (Comp 2), andalizarin (Comp 3) were isolated from the dichloromethane fraction of the roots ofRubia philippinensis., whereas ethyl acetate fraction yielded xanthopurpurin(Comp 4) and lucidin-ω-methyl ether (Comp 5). Structures of all the isolatedcompounds were determined by spectral data analysis. All isolated compounds (Comp1-5) were assessed for cytotoxicity by the3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay against four different cancer cell lines, i.e. human melanoma (SK-MEL-5), murine melanoma(B16F10), and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231).RESULTS: Significant activity of the compounds 4 and 5 was observed against thebreast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with IC50 values of 14.65 ± 1.45 and13.03 ± 0.33 μM, respectively. Encouragingly, IC50 values of 67.89 ± 1.02 and79.01 ± 0.03 μM against normal kidney epithelial cells (MDCK) were also obtained for compounds 4 and 5, respectively, which indicated very low toxicity andfavorable selectivity indices for compounds 4 and 5 in the range of 1.85 to 3.95 and 2.11 to 6.06 against skin cancer cell lines (SK-MEL-5, and B16F10), andbreast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231), respectively.CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the compounds 4 (xanthopurpurin) and 5(lucidin-ω-methyl ether) showed high selective toxicity towards breast cancercells at lower concentrations without showing toxicity towards normal cells, thuscould be of potential as new lead molecules in cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s12906-018-2253-2 PMCID: PMC6029275PMID: 29970094  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
