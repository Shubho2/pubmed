Neratinib and dacomitinib are irreversible panHERinhibitors, which block their autophosphorylation and downstream signaling.Moreover, neratinib and dacomitinib have been shown to activate cell death inHER2-overexpressing cell lines. Here we showed that increased MCL1 and decreased BIM and PUMA mediated resistance to neratinib in ZR-75-30 and SKBR3 cells whileincreased BCL-XL and BCL-2 and decreased BIM and PUMA promoted neratinibresistance in BT474 cells. Cells were also cross-resistant to dacomitinib. BH3profiles of HER2+ breast cancer cells efficiently predicted antiapoptotic proteindependence and development of resistance to panHER inhibitors. Reactivation ofERK1/2 was primarily responsible for acquired resistance in SKBR3 and ZR-75-30cells. Adding specific ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 to neratinib or dacomitinib ledto increased apoptotic response in neratinib-resistant SKBR3 and ZR-75-30 cells, but we did not detect a similar response in neratinib-resistant BT474 cells.Accordingly, suppression of BCL-2/BCL-XL by ABT-737 was required in addition toERK1/2 inhibition for neratinib- or dacomitinib-induced apoptosis inneratinib-resistant BT474 cells. Our results showed that different mitochondrial apoptotic blocks mediated acquired panHER inhibitor resistance in HER2+ breastcancer cell lines as well as highlighted the potential of BH3 profiling assay in prediction of panHER inhibitor resistance in breast cancer cells.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
