The ACR 4microcalcification is an indeterminate or suspected abnormality with 2-95%probability of malignancy, according to studies. This disparity pushed us toconduct this retrospective study of 181 patients in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology I at the Hassan II University Hospital, Fez, over a period of 5years. This study aimed to report the histological results of breast lesionsradiologically classified as ACR4 in order to assess their radio-histologicalcorrelation and to improve therapeutic approach. All patients underwent breastimaging examinations and then anatomopathologic examination was performed usingdifferent techniques. There was a clear predominance of benign lesions with arate of 62% versus 29% of malignant lesions and only 9% were intermediatelesions. Adenofibroma was the most common histological finding (30% of cases),invasive ductal carcinoma was the most frequent malignant lesion (17% of cases). We performed a literature review which showed that our results were in line with findings of other studies, with a positive predictive value of 29%. Nevertheless,ACR classification divided into subcategories 4a, b and c should be used due tothe significant number of unnecessary surgical interventions.DOI: 10.11604/pamj.2018.29.140.13699 PMCID: PMC6057563PMID: 30050604
