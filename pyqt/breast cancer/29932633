This effect triggers the photoactivity and generation ofreactive oxygen species from Ag@ZnO NPs, which results in enhanced cytotoxiceffects and apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231). Inthis context, upregulation of apoptotic cascade proteins (i.e., Bax/Bcl2association, p53, cytochrome c, and caspase-3) along with activation of oxidativestress proteins suggested the occurrence of apoptosis by Ag@ZnO NPs in cancercells through the mitochondrial pathway. Also, preincubation of breast cancercells with Ag@ZnO NPs in dark conditions muted NP-related toxic effects andconsequent apoptotic fate, highlighting biocompatible properties of unexcitedAg@ZnO NPs. Furthermore, the diagnostic efficacy of Ag@ZnO NPs as computedtomography (CT)/optical nanoprobes was investigated. Results confirmed theefficacy of the photoactivated system in obtaining desirable outcomes fromCT/optical imaging, which represents novel theranostic NPs for simultaneousimaging and treatment of cancer.DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b03822 PMID: 29932633
