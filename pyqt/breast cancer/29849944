Some havebeen reported as potential breast cancer biomarkers. This study aimed to identifyand validate miRs indicative of breast cancer.Results: Based on the discovery and literature, 18 potentially informative miRswere quantified in the validation cohort. Irrespective of patient and tumourcharacteristics, hsa-miR-652-5p was significantly upregulated in the malignantcompared to benign patients (1.26 fold, P = 0.005) and therefore validated aspotential biomarker. In the validation cohort literature-based hsa-let-7b levels were higher in malignant patients as well (1.53 fold, P = 0.011). Two miRsdifferentiated benign wildtype from benign BRCA1 mutation carriers and anadditional 8 miRs differentiated metastastic (n = 8) from non-metastatic (n = 41)cases in the validation cohort.Methods: Pre-treatment plasma samples were collected of patients with benignbreast disease and breast cancer and divided over a discovery (n = 31) andvalidation (n = 84) cohort. From the discovery cohort miRs differentiallyexpressed between benign and malignant cases were identified using a 2,000-miRmicroarray. Literature-based miRs differentiating benign from malignant diseasewere added. Using RT-qPCR, their expression was investigated in a validationcohort consisting of pre-treatment benign, malignant and metastatic samples.Additionally, benign and malignant cases were compared to benign and malignantcases of BRCA1-mutation carriers.Conclusions: Plasma microRNA levels differed between patients with and withoutbreast cancer, between benign disease from wildtype and BRCA1-mutation carriersand between breast cancer with and without metastases. Hsa-miR-652-5p wasvalidated as a potential biomarker for breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25262 PMCID: PMC5966243PMID: 29849944
