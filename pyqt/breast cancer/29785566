We report on two sistersoriginally suspected of having CMMRD syndrome due to their history of colonicpolyps and NF1 associated skin findings, both were subsequently found to havebiallelic MSH6 mutations. After years of CMMRD syndrome follow-up, the probandwas diagnosed with breast cancer at age 29, while her sister was diagnosed with aglioblastoma at age 27. Immunohistochemistry analysis on the breast tumor tissue revealed weak MSH6 protein staining. Exome sequencing revealed a hypermutatedbreast tumor and an ultra-hypermutated brain tumor. Multi-gene panel testing was also performed and revealed no additional mutations which might explain theproband's early onset breast cancer. This is the first documented case of breast cancer in an individual with CMMRD syndrome. We summarize the evidence supportingthe possible association between breast cancer and biallelic MMR mutations.Healthcare providers should be aware of this possible association and follow-upappropriately for suspicious breast findings. In addition, this case highlightsthe need for frequent central nervous system screenings due to rapid progression of brain tumors.DOI: 10.1007/s10689-018-0088-0 PMID: 29785566
