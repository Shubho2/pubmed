Methods: Weretrospectively analyzed and re-evaluated the IHC-staining pattern of 2538 IHC-2+surgical specimens of breast cancer from November 2014 to October 2015 in 12institutions. All cases used for building a prediction model of HER2 geneamplification according to the IHC-staining pattern and were randomly dividedinto a training set (n = 1914) or validation set (n = 624). Results: The overall HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) amplification, non-amplificationand equivocation rates in HER2 IHC-2+ cases were 17.8%, 76.2% and 6.0%,respectively. In the training set, cases that had â‰¤ 10% of cells with intense,complete and circumferential membrane staining or had > 85% of cells withcomplete membrane staining of any staining intensity tended to be HER2 geneamplified (77.0% and 60.5%, respectively). And cases with weak and incompletemembrane staining had the lowest amplification rate of 6.1%. The prediction modelwas constructed based on IHC-staining pattern in the training set and validatedusing a validation set. The positive and negative prediction values were 51.6%and 79.2%, respectively, in the validation set. Moreover, the HER2 copy numberper cell was much higher in cases with amplification-associated staining patterns(7.84 and 8.75) than in cases with non-amplification-associated staining patterns(2.97 to 4.41, P < 0.05). Conclusions: In HER2 IHC-2+ breast cancers, thestaining pattern is associated with the HER2 gene status. This finding iscompatible with recommendations of 2013 ASCO/CAP guidelines.DOI: 10.7150/jca.25586 PMCID: PMC6036724PMID: 30026828
