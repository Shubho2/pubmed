ESR1 mutational mediated resistance may be overcome by selective ERdegraders (SERDs). During the first-in-human study of oral SERD AZD9496, earlychanges in circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) wereexplored as potential non-invasive tools, alongside paired tumor biopsies, toassess pharmacodynamics and early efficacy.METHODS: CTC were enumerated/phenotyped for ER and Ki67 using CellSearch® inserial blood draws. ctDNA was assessed for the most common ESR1LBDm by dropletdigital PCR (BioRad).RESULTS: Before starting AZD9496, 11/43 (25%) patients had ≥5CTC/7.5mL wholeblood (WB), none of whom underwent reduction to <5CTC/7.5mL WB on C1D15. 5/11patients had baseline CTC-ER+, 2 of whom had CTC-ER+ reduction. CTC-Ki67 statusdid not change appreciably. Patients with ≥5CTC/7.5mL WB pre-treatment had worse progression-free survival (PFS) than patients with <5CTC (p=0.0003). Fourteen of 45 (31%) patients had ESR1LBDm+ ctDNA at baseline, 5 of whom had ≥2 uniquemutations. Baseline ESR1LBDm status was not prognostic. Patients withpersistently elevated CTC and/or ESR1LBDm+ ctDNA at C1D15 had worse PFS thanpatients who did not (p=0.0007).CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CTC at baseline was a strong prognostic factor in thiscohort. Early on-treatment changes were observed in CTC-ER+ and ESR1LBDm+ ctDNA, but not in overall CTC number. Integrating multiple biomarkers in prospectivetrials may improve outcome prediction and ET resistance mechanisms'identification over a single biomarker.Copyright ©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1569 PMID: 30082476
