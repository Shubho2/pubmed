There are fivemajor histologic subtypes of ovarian cancer and high grade serous cancer (themost common) is reported in 75-100% of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Weexamined histology-based referral to the Hereditary Cancer Program following aneducational prevention campaign recommending BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation screeningfor all high-grade serous cancer patients.METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective study in the province ofBritish Columbia, Canada that included all patients visiting the HereditaryCancer Program for genetic counselling for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation between 2001 and 2014. We examined the difference in rates of BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing between serous cancer patients and endometrioid and clear cell cancer patients using adifferences in differences analysis. We also calculated the mean number of familymembers tested for every BRCA1 and BRCA2 identified ovarian cancer patient beforeand after the educational campaign.RESULTS: There were 5712 women tested for a BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation at the HCPbetween 2001 and 2014, 887 of which had previously received a diagnosis ofovarian cancer. By 2013, 43% of serous cancer patients were being tested forBRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations compared with 20% of endometrioid and clear cellpatients (p < 0.001). The mean number of family members tested for each BRCA1 andBRCA2 positive ovarian cancer patient increased after the educational campaignfrom 2.54 to 3.27 (p = 0.071), and the number of family members identified asBRCA positive also increased significantly.CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for histology-based referral significantly increasedthe likelihood of serous cancer patients being tested for BRCA mutations. Therewas also an increase in the number of carrier tests performed for each BRCA1 and BRCA2 index ovarian cancer patient.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4153-8 PMCID: PMC5838948PMID: 29506471
