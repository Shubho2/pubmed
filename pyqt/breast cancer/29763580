Electronic address: maria_al_rashida@hotmail.com.Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide. Therapeutic approachto cancer is a multi-faceted one, whereby many cellular/enzymatic pathways havebeen discovered as important drug targets for the treatment of cancer. A majordisadvantage of most of the currently available anticancer drugs is theirnon-selective cytotoxicity towards cancerous as well as healthy cells. Anothermajor hurdle in cancer therapy is the development of resistance to anticancerdrugs. This necessitates the discovery of new molecules with potent and selectivecytotoxic activity towards only cancerous cells, with minimum or no damage to thenormal/healthy cells. Herein we report detailed investigation into the anticanceractivity of sulfamoyl benz(sulfon)amides (1a-1g, 2a-2k) and 1H-pyrazol-4-ylbenzamides (3a-3j) against three cancer cell lines, breast cancer cells (MCF-7), bone-marrow cancer cells (K-562) and cervical cancer cells (HeLa). Forcomparison, screening against healthy baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) wascarried out. All compounds exhibited selective cytotoxicity towards cancerouscells. Cell cycle analysis was carried out using flow cytometry, followed byfluorescence microscopic analysis. DNA interaction and docking studies were also carried out.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
