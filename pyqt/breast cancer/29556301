China.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between enhancement patterns and parameters in contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) andmicrovessel distribution and histological prognostic tumor characteristics ofbreast cancer. Between September 2011 and April 2013, 109 breast lesions wereprospectively analyzed, which were classified into Breast Imaging Reporting andData System class 4-5 by conventional ultrasound. Before core-needle biopsy, CEUSexamination was performed. Different enhancement patterns (homogeneous,peripheral and regional enhancement) were evaluated. Following CEUS, biopsieswere performed at the same body positions under guidance of ultrasound.Parameters (wash-in time, peak intensity, time to peak, area under thetime-intensity curve, ascending slope) of CEUS at corresponding puncture siteswere recorded. Microvessel density (MVD) and pathological prognostic factors,including histological grade, lymph node status, tumor-node-metastasis stage,estrogen and progesterone receptor status, Ki-67 proliferative index and humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression, were determined. Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman's rank-correlation test and independent-samples t-tests wereused for evaluation. Core-needle biopsy or surgical resection specimens of 99malignant breast lesions were included in the present study. Of the 99 malignant lesions, 44 lesions exhibited homogeneous enhancement, 43 exhibited peripheralenhancement and 12 exhibited regional enhancement. Lesions with peripheralenhancement exhibited a higher peripheral/central ratio of MVD compared withlesions with homogeneous enhancement (P<0.001). Peak intensity and ascendingslope ratios of tumor periphery/center were correlated with the corresponding MVDratios (P=0.017 and P=0.016, respectively). MVD ratio was positively correlatedwith histological grade (P=0.003). In conclusion, the enhancement patterns andparameters of CEUS may not only reflect the microvessel distribution but alsoindirectly indicate the histological grade of breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8078 PMCID: PMC5844090PMID: 29556301
