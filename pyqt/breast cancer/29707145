Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)assays were optimized to monitor circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels inplasmatic samples collected throughout the treatment course and showed theimportance of using the absolute value for ctDNA rather than the mutant/wild typeratio in monitoring the therapy outcome. High baseline cell free DNA (cfDNA)levels are associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (HR 7.38, P=0.001). Anearly increase (D14) in mutated copies/mL is associated with a significantlyworse PFS (HR 6.12, P=0.008) and OS (HR 8.02, P=0.004). These data suggest a highprognostic value for early ctDNA level changes and support the use of blood-born genomic markers as a tool for treatment.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24879 PMCID: PMC5915153PMID: 29707145
