Inpatients receiving metformin for metabolic syndrome or diabetes, it reduces theincidence and improves the survival of breast cancer (BC) patients. We havepreviously shown that metformin is particularly potent against triple negativebreast cancer (TNBC), with a reduction of proliferation, oncogenicity andmotility, inhibition of pro-oncogenic signaling pathways and induction ofapoptosis. These BCs are well recognized to be highly dependent onglucose/glucosamine (metabolized through anaerobic glycolysis) and lipids, which are metabolized for the production of energy and cellular building blocks tosustain a high rate of proliferation. We have previously demonstrated thatmetformin inhibits lipid metabolism, specifically targeting fatty acid synthase(FASN), cholesterol biosynthesis and GM1 lipid rafts in TNBC. We also reportedthat glucose promotes phenotypic aggression and reduces metformin efficacy. Wenow show that metformin inhibits several key enzymes requisite to glucosemetabolism in TNBC, providing additional insight into why metformin is especiallytoxic to this subtype of BC. Our data suggests that the use of metformin totarget key metabolic defects in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in cancer maybe broadly applicable, especially against highly aggressive malignant cells.DOI: 10.4172/2476-2261.1000129 PMCID: PMC5959056PMID: 29780974
