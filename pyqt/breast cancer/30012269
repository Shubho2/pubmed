We aimed to estimate the outcomes of different early detection strategies in combination with systemic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy inLMICs.METHODS: We adapted a microsimulation model to project outcomes of three earlydetection strategies alone or in combination with three systemic treatmentprogrammes beyond standard of care (programme A): programme B was endocrinetherapy for all oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive cases; programme C was programmeB plus chemotherapy for ER-negative cases; programme D was programme C pluschemotherapy for advanced ER-positive cases. The main outcomes were reductions inbreast cancer-related mortality and lives saved per 100 000 women relative to thestandard of care for women aged 30-49 years in a low-income setting (East Africa;using incidence data and life tables from Uganda and data on tumourcharacteristics from various East African countries) and for women aged 50-69years in a middle-income setting (Colombia).FINDINGS: In the East African setting, relative mortality reductions were 8-41%, corresponding to 23 (95% uncertainty interval -12 to 49) to 114 (80 to 138) livessaved per 100 000 women over 10 years. In Colombia, mortality reductions were7-25%, corresponding to 32 (-29 to 70) to 105 (61 to 141) lives saved per 100 000women over 10 years.INTERPRETATION: The best projected outcomes were in settings where access to bothearly detection and adjuvant therapy is improved. Even in the absence ofmammographic screening, improvements in detection can provide substantial benefitin settings where advanced-stage presentation is common.FUNDING: Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center/University of Washington CancerConsortium Cancer Center Support Grant of the US National Institutes of Health.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).
