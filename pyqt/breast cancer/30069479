In addition to tumour cells, tumourstroma is also modified in relationship to the primary tumour as well as todistant metastatic sites (forming a metastatic niche). A common denominator ofmost stromal partners in tumour progression is CD36, a scavenger receptor forfatty acid uptake that modulates cell-to-extracellular matrix attachment, stromalcell fate (for adipocytes, endothelial cells), TGFÎ² activation, and immunesignalling. CD36 has been repeatedly proposed as a prognostic marker in variouscancers, mostly of epithelial origin (breast, prostate, ovary, and colon) andalso for hepatic carcinoma and gliomas. Data gathered in preclinical models ofvarious cancers have shown that blocking CD36 might prove beneficial in stopping metastasis spread. However, targeting the receptor in clinical trials withthrombospondin mimetic peptides has proven ineffective, and monoclonal antibodiesare not yet available for patient use. This review presents data to support CD36 as a potential prognostic biomarker in cancer, its current stage towardsachieving bona fide biomarker status, and knowledge gaps that must be filledbefore further advancement towards clinical practice.DOI: 10.1155/2018/7801202 PMCID: PMC6057354PMID: 30069479
