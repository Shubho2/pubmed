The aim of thisstudy was to determine the pathway that women follow to breast cancer care andfactors associated with this journey.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in theWestern Cape Province, SA, between May 2015 and May 2016. Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were interviewed to determine their socio-demographic profile;knowledge of risk factors, signs and symptoms; appraisal of breast changes;clinical profile and; key time events in the journey to care. The Model ofPathways to Treatment Framework underpinned the analysis. The total time (TT)between a woman noticing the first breast change and the date of scheduledtreatment was divided into 3 intervals: the patient interval (PI); the diagnosticinterval (DI) and the pre-treatment interval (PTI). For the PI, DI and PTI abivariate comparison of median time intervals by various characteristics wasconducted using Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests. CoxProportional-Hazards models were used to identify factors independentlyassociated with the PI, DI and PTI.RESULTS: The median age of the 201 participants was 54 years, and 22% presentedwith late stage disease. The median TT was 110 days, with median patient,diagnostic and pre-treatment intervals of 23, 28 and 37 days respectively.Factors associated with the PI were: older age (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.59, 95% CI0.40-0.86), initial symptom denial (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19-0.97) and waiting for a lump to increase in size before seeking care (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.77). Womenwith co-morbidities had a significantly longer DI (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.96) as did women who mentioned denial of initial breast symptoms (HR 4.61, 95% CI1.80-11.78). The PTI was associated with late stage disease at presentation (HR1.78, 95% CI 1.15-2.76).CONCLUSION: The Model of Pathways to Treatment provides a useful framework toexplore patient's journeys to care and identified opportunities for targetedinterventions.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4219-7 PMCID: PMC5863383PMID: 29562894
