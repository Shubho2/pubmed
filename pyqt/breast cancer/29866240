Primary small cell carcinoma of the breast, anexceptionally uncommon and aggressive tumor, is frequently characterised by earlyprogression and worse outcome. Moreover, it is essential to distinguish betweensmall cell carcinoma arising primarily in the breast and the metastatic diseaseto the breast. We had a patient of primary small cell carcinoma of breast. As herinitial metastatic workup was negative for disease elsewhere, so she was started on neoadjuvant chemotherapy to which she responded well. Her modified radicalmastectomy (MRM) was done followed by completion of chemotherapy up to 6 cyclesand local radiotherapy of chest wall. However, the disease behaved aggressivelyafterwards as she developed recurrence twice at 9 and 19 months interval,respectively, for which she was considered for second and third linechemotherapy. An accurate management of the primary small cell carcinoma of thebreast still lacks a consensus. Relevant studies were also reviewed to enhanceknowledge and expertise in diagnosis, clinicopathologic features, management, andoutcome of this tumor.DOI: 10.29271/jcpsp.2018.06.S112 PMID: 29866240
