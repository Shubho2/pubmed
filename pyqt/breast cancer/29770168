Itis the most diagnosed and the second killer cancer among women. Breast cancer canbe originated from tissues of breast or secondary from other organs viametastasis. Generally, cancer cells show aberrant metabolism and oxidative stresswhen compared to noncancerous tissues of breast cancer patients. The currentstudy aims at evaluating glutamate and glucose metabolism through GDH and LDHenzyme activities, oxidant, and antioxidative status among breast cancer patientsattending referral hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Result. Catalyticactivities of glutamate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and oxidativestress index were significantly increased in both serum (4.2 mU/ml, 78.6 mU/ml,and 3.3 : 1, resp.) and cancerous tissues (1.4 mU/ml, 111.7 mU/ml, and 2.15 : 1, resp.) of breast cancer patients as compared to those in serum of control group(3.15 mU/ml, 30.4 mU/ml, and 2.05 : 1, resp.) and noncancerous tissues of breast cancer patients (0.92 mU/ml, 70.5 mU/ml, and 1.1 : 1, resp.) (P ≤ 0.05).Correspondingly, ratios of reduced to oxidized glutathione were significantlydecreased in both serum (20 : 1) and cancerous tissues (23.5 : 1) of breastcancer patients when compared to those in serum of control group (104.5 : 1) and noncancerous tissues of breast cancer patients (70.9 : 1) (P ≤ 0.05). Conclusion.Catalytic activities of GDH and LDH, ratios of GSH to GSSG, and concentration of TOS among breast cancer patients were significantly higher than were those among control group and noncancerous tissues of breast cancer patients, while TAC ofbreast cancer patients is significantly lower than that of control group andnormal tissues of breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6039453 PMCID: PMC5892235PMID: 29770168
