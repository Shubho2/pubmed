[Epub ahead of print]Different Dimensions of Religiousness/Spirituality Are Associated with HealthBehaviors in Breast Cancer Survivors.Park CL(1), Waddington E(1), Abraham R(1).Author information: (1)University of Connecticut.OBJECTIVE: Religiousness/spirituality (R/S) may influence cancer survivors'health through multiple pathways. We aimed to examine one potentially key pathwaythat has seldom been examined: relationships between survivors' R/S and theirhealth behaviors.METHODS: The present study investigated links between four core dimensions of R/S(beliefs, behaviors, identity, coping) and three health behaviors(fruit/vegetable consumption, physical activity, maintenance of a healthy weight)in 172 breast cancer survivors.RESULTS: Both spiritual identity and use of religious coping were positivelyrelated to fruit and vegetable intake, while private prayer was marginallypositively related. Both service attendance and religious identity (marginally)were related to engaging in less physical activity, while private prayer waspositively related. Afterlife beliefs and private prayer were positivelyassociated with BMI.CONCLUSIONS: R/S has complex but meaningful associations with health behaviors inbreast cancer survivors. More research is needed to understand theserelationships and to determine whether different dimensions of R/S may playuseful roles in lifestyle change interventions.This article is protected by copyright.
