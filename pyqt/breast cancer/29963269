Syndecan-1 is theheparan sulfate proteoglycan associated with malignancy of various cancers,including breast cancer. In this study, we proposed a experimental workflow toinvestigate potential microRNAs that regulate SDC1 expression and affect breastcancer cell mobility. MicroRNA candidates were selected from available GeneExpression Omnibus datasets on breast malignancy. Further in silico duplexhybridization and multiplex PCR approach were used to screen potential microRNAs.Analysis showed increased syndecan-1 expression but decreased miR-122-5p levelupon breast malignancy. Western blot and in vitro luciferase assay confirmed the targeting of 3'-untranslated region of syndecan-1 and suppression of syndecan-1expression by miR-122-5p. The suppression of syndecan-1 expression by miR-122-5p or shRNAs against syndecan-1 increased breast cancer cell mobility; whileoverexpression of syndecan-1 inhibited cell mobility. In further, miR-122-5p was enriched in liver cell-derived exosomes that was able to suppress syndecan-1expression and increase cell mobility in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our results suggested the downregulation of SDC1 by miR-122-5p or liver-cell-derived exosomes would enhance breast cancer cell mobility. Metastasis or mobility ofbreast cancer cells might be affected by circulating miR-122-5p and not directly correlated with progression of breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25589 PMCID: PMC6021336PMID: 29963269
