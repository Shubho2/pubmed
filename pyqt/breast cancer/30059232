[Epub ahead ofprint]Liposomal Irinotecan Achieves Significant Survival and Tumor Burden Control in a Triple Negative Breast Cancer Model of Spontaneous Metastasis.Bernards N, Ventura M, Fricke IB, Hendriks BS, Fitzgerald J, Lee H, Zheng J.OBJECTIVE: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a significanttherapeutic challenge due to its highly aggressive nature and lack of effectivetreatment options. Liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI, ONIVYDEÂ®) was approved in 2015 (by the FDA, EMA, and TGA) and is a topoisomerase inhibitor indicated, incombination with fluorouracil and leucovorin, for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression followinggemcitabine-based therapy. This study investigates the potential therapeuticbenefit of nal-IRI for the treatment of advanced TNBC in a clinically relevantmouse model of spontaneous metastasis (LM2-4).METHODS: Female SCID mice were orthotopically inoculated with TNBC LM2-4-luccells in the lower mammary fat pad. Following primary tumor resection,bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was used to monitor both metastasis formation andspread, as well as response to treatment with nal-IRI.RESULTS: Weekly treatment with 10 mg/kg of nal-IRI provided a 4.9x longer median survival compared to both 50 mg/kg irinotecan treated and untreated animals. The survival benefit was supported by a significant delay in the regrowth of theprimary tumor, effective control and eventual regression of metastases assessedusing longitudinal BLI which was confirmed at the study endpoint with magneticresonance (MR) imaging and post-mortem observation.CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical investigation demonstrates that, at a five timeslower dose compared to the free drug, liposomal irinotecan provides significantsurvival benefit and effective management of metastatic disease burden in aclinically relevant model of spontaneous TNBC metastases. These findings support the evaluation of nal-IRI in patients with advanced and metastatic TNBC.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00540 PMID: 30059232
