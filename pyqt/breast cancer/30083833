However, little evidence exists on the accuracy ofintraoperative touch imprint cytology (ITPC) applied in TAD after neoadjuvantchemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer patients with initial axillary metastasis.This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of ITPC in TAD after NAC.METHODS: Breast cancer patients with biopsy-confirmed nodal metastasis wereprospectively enrolled in the study. After completion of NAC, all patientsunderwent TAD followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Then ITPC wasperformed to evaluate BxLNs and SLNs. The accuracy of TAD and ITPC was calculatedin comparison with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of ALNs. The results ofITPC during 6 months at our center in the adjuvant setting were used forcomparison .RESULTS: Overall, the false-negative rate of TAD was 10.8%. In a test with 92patients, ITPC had an accuracy of 92.4%, a sensitivity of 87.9%, and aspecificity of 94.9%. In the non-NAC group, ITPC showed similar accuracy (91.2%) and specificity (97.9%) but significantly lower sensitivity (68.9%; P = 0.03).CONCLUSIONS: The use of ITPC was feasible for TAD among breast cancer patientswith biopsy-confirmed axillary metastasis who were treated with NAC. All themisses in the ITPC involved patients with micrometastases or isolated tumorcells. Use of ITPC can help decrease the number of second operations for patientswith residual disease in ALNs after NAC.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6548-9 PMID: 30083833
