Current EGFR-directed therapies have led to increasedefficacy but are associated with specific side effects. The antibody-drugconjugate depatuxizumab mafodotin (depatux-m) targets EGFR with a monoclonalantibody linked to a cytotoxin, and is highly tumor-specific.METHODS: This phase 1/2 study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, andefficacy of depatux-m in patients who had advanced solid tumors with knownwild-type EGFR overexpression, amplification, or mutated EGFR variant III. A 3 + 3 dose escalation was used, and 2 dosing schedules were evaluated. Depatux-m alsowas manufactured under an alternate process to reduce the drug load and improvethe safety profile, and it was tested at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Inanother cohort, prolonged infusion time of depatux-m was evaluated; and a cohort with confirmed EGFR amplification also was evaluated at the MTD.RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were treated. The MTD and the recommended phase 2dose for depatux-m was 3.0 mg/kg. Common adverse events (AEs) were blurred vision(48%) and fatigue (41%). A majority of patients (66%) experienced 1 or moreocular AEs. Grade 3 or 4 AEs were observed in 43% of patients. One patient withEGFR-amplified, triple-negative breast cancer had a partial response. Stabledisease was observed in 23% of patients. Pharmacokinetics revealed that depatux-mexposures were approximately dose-proportional.CONCLUSIONS: Depatux-m resulted in infrequent nonocular AEs but increased ocular AEs. Patient follow-up confirmed that ocular AEs were reversible. Lowering thedrug-antibody ratio did not decrease the number of ocular AEs. A partial responsein 1 patient with EGFR-amplified disease provides the opportunity to studydepatux-m in diseases with a high incidence of EGFR amplification.
