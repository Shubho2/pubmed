Surgery isthe first line of treatment for breast cancer. Retrospective clinical studiessuggest that the type of anesthesia administered during oncological surgery mayinfluence patient outcome. Propofol, the widely used intravenous anestheticagent, may lead to better outcomes compared to volatile anesthetics. Here wereview the literature on the effect of propofol in breast cancer cells, theimmune system, pain management, and patient outcomes. Evidence from the study of breast cancer cell lines suggests that high concentrations of propofol have both anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects. Propofol and volatile anesthetics havedifferent effects on the immune system. Propofol has also been shown to reducethe development and severity of acute and chronic pain following surgery.Although a retrospective study that included many types of cancer indicated that propofol increases the long-term survival of patients following surgery, theevidence for this in breast cancer is weak. It has been shown that Propofolcombined with paravertebral block led to change of serum composition that affectsthe breast cancer cell behaviors and natural killer cell activity. Prospectivestudies are in progress and will be finished within 5 years. The existingevidence is not sufficient to warrant changes to current anesthetic management.Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which propofol affectscancer cells and the immune system.DOI: 10.1186/s12871-018-0543-3 PMCID: PMC6020422PMID: 29945542
