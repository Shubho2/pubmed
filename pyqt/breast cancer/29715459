In the presentstudy, we have explored the possible role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) inregulating the paclitaxel-sensitivity of ErbB2/ErbB3-coexpressing breast cancercells. We show that human umbilical cord-derived MSCs express significantlyhigher level of neuregulin-1 as compared with ErbB2/ErbB3-coexpressing breastcancer cells themselves. Coculture or treatment with conditioned medium of MSCsnot only decreases the anti-proliferation effect of paclitaxel onErbB2/ErbB3-coexpressing breast cancer cells, but also significantly inhibitspaclitaxel-induced apoptosis. We further demonstrate that this MSCs-drivedpaclitaxel resistance in ErbB2/ErbB3-coexpressing breast cancer cells could beattributed to upregulation of Survivin via paracrine effect ofNRG-1/ErbB3/PI-3K/Akt signaling, as either specific knockdown expression ofErbB3, or blocking of downstream PI-3K/Akt signaling, or specific inhibition ofSurvivin can completely reverse this effect. Moreover, targeted knockdown ofNRG-1 expression in MSCs abrogates theirs effect on paclitaxel sensitivity ofErbB2/ErbB3-coexpressing breast cancer cells. Taken together, our study indicate that paracrine of NRG-1 by MSCs induces paclitaxel resistance inErbB2/ErbB3-coexpressing breast cancer cells through PI-3K/Aktsignaling-dependent upregulation of Survivin. Our findings suggest thatsimultaneously targeting mesenchymal stem cells in tumor microenvironment may be a novel strategy to overcome paclitaxel resistance in patients withErbB2/ErbB3-coexpressing breast cancer.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
