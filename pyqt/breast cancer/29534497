Despite being a powerful anticancer drug, doxorubicin shows severe off-target effects and therefore would need a carrier for thehighest effectiveness. We aimed to chemically modify carbonate apatite (CA) with Krebs cycle intermediates, such as citrate and succinate in order to control the growth of the resultant particles to more efficiently carry and transport theanticancer drug into the cancer cells. Citrate- or succinate-modified CAparticles were synthesized with different concentrations of sodium citrate orsodium succinate, respectively, in the absence or presence of doxorubicin. Thedrug loading efficiency of the particles and their cellular uptake were observed by quantifying fluorescence intensity. The average diameter and surface charge ofthe particles were determined using Zetasizer. Cell viability was assessed by MTTassay. Citrate-modified carbonate apatite (CMCA) exhibited the highest (31.38%)binding affinity for doxorubicin and promoted rapid cellular uptake of the drug, leading to the half-maximal inhibitory concentration 1000 times less than that ofthe free drug in MCF-7 cells. Hence, CMCA nanoparticles with greater surface areaenhance cytotoxicity in different breast cancer cells by enabling higher loading and more efficient cellular uptake of the drug.DOI: 10.3390/pharmaceutics10010032 PMCID: PMC5874845PMID: 29534497
