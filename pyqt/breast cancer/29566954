After an accurate review of the literature, it appeared thatno ordered list of the numerous techniques described for conservative breastsurgery has been established so far. The aim of this study was to develop asimple classification of the different skin incision patterns that may be used inbreast surgery.METHODS: A systematic review of the English literature was conducted using thePubMed database to identify all the articles reporting breast-conserving surgery and skin-sparring mastectomy techniques up to the 31st of December 2016.RESULTS: Among the 1426 titles identified, 230 were selected for review. Based onthe reviewed papers, the skin-reducing oncoplasty incision pattern (SROIP)classification was elaborated.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer surgery should nowadays optimise aesthetic outcomes byimproving the final breast shape, volume and scar location. This may be achieved using different procedures that we grouped together under the term skin-reducing oncoplasty (SRO). Depending on the breast cancer location, the SROIPclassification helps in the choice of the best technique to be used.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
