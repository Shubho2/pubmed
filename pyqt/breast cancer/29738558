However, plasma cytokines and tissueinflammation that discriminate T2D risk in African American women with obesephenotypes are not well understood. We analyzed 64 circulating cytokines andchemokines in plasma of 120 African American women enrolled in the Black Women's Health Study. We used regression analysis to identify cytokines and chemokinesassociated with obesity, co-morbid T2D and hypertension, and compared results to obese women without these co-morbidities, as well as to lean women without theco-morbidities. We then used hierarchical clustering to generate inflammationsignatures by combining the effects of identified cytokines and chemokines andsummarized the signatures using an inflammation score. The analyses revealed six distinct signatures of sixteen cytokines/chemokines (P = 0.05) that differedsignificantly by prevalence of T2D (P = 0.004), obesity (P = 0.0231) and overall inflammation score (P < E-12). Signatures were validated in two independentcohorts of African American women with obesity: thirty nine subjects with nometabolic complications or with T2D and hypertension; and thirteen breastreduction surgical patients. The signatures in the validation cohorts closelyresembled the distributions in the discovery cohort. We find that blood-basedcytokine profiles usefully associate inflammation with T2D risks in vulnerablesubjects, and should be combined with metabolism and obesity counselling forpersonalized risk assessment.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196755 PMCID: PMC5940209PMID: 29738558  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
