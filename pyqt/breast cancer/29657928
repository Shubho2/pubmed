This study attempt to find cytotoxicity of hexane (HEX), dichloromethane (DCM), and butanol (BUTOH) partitions ofSargassum angustifolium.Materials and Methods: S. angustifolium was collected from Bushehr, a Southwestcoastline of Persian Gulf. The plant was extracted by maceration withmethanol-ethyl acetate. The extract was evaporated under vacuum and partitionedby Kupchan method to yield HEX, DCM, and BUTOH partitions. The cytotoxic activityof the extract (150, 450, and 900 μg/ml) was investigated against MCF-7 (breastcancer), HeLa (cervical cancer), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells cell lines by mitochondrial tetrazolium test assay after 72 h.Results: The cell survivals of HeLa and MCF-7 cell were decreased by increasingthe concentration of extracts from 150 μg/ml to 900 μg/ml. The median growthinhibitory concentration value of HEX partition was 71 and 77 μg/ml against HeLa and MCF-7, dichloromethane partition was 36 and 88 μg/ml against HeLa and MCF-7, respectively. BUTOH partition was 25 μg/ml against MCF-7.Conclusion: This study reveals that different partitions of S. angustifolium havecytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines.DOI: 10.4103/abr.abr_259_16 PMCID: PMC5887695PMID: 29657928
