This association has not beenindependently assessed in African American women, despite reports that thesewomen are more likely to present with fibroadenomas.METHODS: The study cohort included 3853 African American women with a breastbiopsy completed between 1997 and 2010 in metropolitan Detroit. Biopsies weremicroscopically reviewed for benign breast lesions, including fibroadenoma,proliferative disease, and atypia. Risk of breast cancer within the cohort wasestimated using relative risk ratios and 95% CIs calculated using multivariablelog-binomial regression. Relative risk of breast cancer in this cohort comparedwith African American women in the broader metropolitan Detroit population wasestimated using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs).RESULTS: Fibroadenomas occurred more frequently in biopsies of younger women, andother types of benign breast lesions were less likely to occur when afibroadenoma was present (p = 0.008 for lobular hyperplasia; all other p values< 0.01). Unlike women with other benign lesions (SIR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.20, 1.66), women with fibroadenomas did not have an increased risk of developing breastcancer compared with the general population (SIR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.75, 1.18).Biopsies that indicated a fibroadenoma were associated with a reduced risk ofbreast cancer after adjusting for age at biopsy, proliferation, and atypia(relative risk, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48, 0.93) compared with biopsies without afibroadenoma.CONCLUSIONS: These findings have important implications for breast cancer riskmodels and clinical assessment, particularly among African American women, inwhom fibroadenomas are common.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1027-6 PMID: 30092846
