Cases were women withinvasive breast cancer aged 66 + years (N = 30,004) identified by SEER registries(years 2007-2011). Controls were women (N = 198,969) identified from a 5% random sample of Medicare recipients alive and breast cancer free in year of selection. Participants had a minimum of 13 months of Part A, Part B non-health maintenance organization Medicare and Part D Medicare coverage at least 13 months precedingcancer diagnosis/selection. Exposures were assessed until 12 months beforediagnosis/control selection. Odds ratios (OR) and 99.9% confidence intervals (CI)were estimated using adjusted unconditional and multinomial logistic regression.RESULTS: ORs of invasive breast cancer associated with dyslipidemia, statins, andnon-statin lipid-lowering drugs were 0.86 (99.9% CI 0.81-0.90), 1.07 (99.9% CI1.03-1.13) and 1.03 (99.9% CI 0.95-1.11), respectively. Risk reductions withdyslipidemia were slightly greater when untreated than treated and did not varymuch by time between dyslipidemia and breast cancer diagnosis. Whether treated oruntreated, dyslipidemia was associated with greater reductions in risk for later stage than earlier stage breast cancer (p-heterogeneity < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Lipid-lowering drugs did not account for the lower breast cancerrisk associated with dyslipidemia. Our data do not support using statins or otherlipid-lowering drugs to prevent breast cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4680-7 PMID: 29450675
