To gain insight into this issue, female Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-fat diet were given the carcinogen N-methyl-N-nitrosourea and randomlyassigned to vehicle (control), NPH (unmodified human insulin), glargine ordetemir (n = 30 per treatment). Insulins were given subcutaneously (15 U/kg/day) 5 days a week. Mammary tumours were counted twice weekly, and after 6 weeks oftreatment, extracted for analysis. None of the insulin-treated groups hadincreased mammary tumour incidence at any time compared with control. At 6 weeks,tumour multiplicity was increased with NPH or glargine (P < 0.05) and tended tobe increased with detemir (P = 0.2); however, there was no difference amonginsulins (number of tumours per rat: control = 0.8 ± 0.1, NPH = 1.8 ± 0.3,glargine = 1.5 ± 0.4, detemir = 1.4 ± 0.4; number of tumours per tumour-bearingrat: control = 1.3 ± 0.1, NPH = 2.2 ± 0.4, glargine = 2.7 ± 0.5,detemir = 2.3 ± 0.5). IGF-1R expression in tumours was lower than that inMichigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells, a cell line that shows greaterproliferation with glargine than unmodified insulin. In rats, glargine wasrapidly metabolised to M1 that does not have greater affinity for IGF-1R. Inconclusion, in this model of oestrogen-dependent breast cancer ininsulin-resistant rats, insulin and insulin analogues increased tumourmultiplicity with no difference between insulin types.© 2018 The authors.DOI: 10.1530/EC-17-0358 PMCID: PMC5958747PMID: 29692348
