The PET tracer alsodemonstrates ability to probe viability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) in WTmice compared with their mdr1a/1b(-/-) (dKO) and mdr1a/1b/ABCG2(-/-/-) (t-KO)counterparts. Herein, we report dosimetry data for 68Ga[Ga]-Galmydar in mice, andextrapolate that information to determine effective dose (ED) for human studies.METHODS: To further assess safety profiles of 68Ga[Ga]-Galmydar for enabling its deployment as a PET imaging probe for biomedical imaging in vivo, we estimatedhuman radiation dosimetry extrapolated from mice biodistribution data. Toaccomplish this objective, 68Ga[Ga]-Galmydar was injected intravenously intotails, mice were euthanized, organs harvested (5min, 15min, 30min, 60min,120min), counted, radiation doses to each organ, and whole body were alsodetermined.RESULTS: The effective dose (ED) have been found to be 0.021mGy/MBq in males and 0.023mGy/MBq in females. The highest radiation dose was estimated to the kidneys with a value of 0.17mGy/MBq for males and 0.19mGy/MBq for females withcontribution from activity in the urine prior to excretion. The critical organ inhumans has been determined to be the gall bladder. These data provide preliminaryprojections on human dosimetry derived from rodent estimates thus providingplatform for further validation of dosimetry analysis in human subjects.CONCLUSIONS: Combined data obtained from radiation dosimetry studies in miceindicate that 68Ga[Ga]-Galmydar would be safe for further evaluation of dosimetrytoxicity and myocardial perfusion PET imaging in humans.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.
