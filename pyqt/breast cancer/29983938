The findings indicated that the mixtures of ACCH and EGb could beused to prevent and treat some diseases caused by the excessive free radicals,especially cancer. Therefore, the mixtures of ACCH and EGb might serve as anatural source of desirable antioxidant and anticancer agents for thenutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries.DOI: 10.1002/fsn3.587 PMCID: PMC6021696PMID: 29983938
