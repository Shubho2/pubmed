In addition, dysregulation of PI3K signalingmay contribute to resistance to several anticancer agents. PI3K inhibitors may,therefore, be effective as antineoplastic therapy. Buparlisib is a potent andhighly specific oral inhibitor of the pan-class I PI3K family. Buparlisibspecifically inhibits class I PIK3 in the PI3K/AKT kinase signaling pathway in anATP-competitive manner, thus inhibiting the production of the secondary messengerphosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and activation of the PI3K signalingpathway. This may induce inhibition of tumor cell growth and survival insusceptible tumor cell populations. Buparlisib is currently under investigationin patients with a variety of solid tumors, including breast cancer. Buparlisibhas been validated as a promising anticancer agent, and tremendous efforts havebeen taken to develop it. However, buparlisib monotherapy has resulted in humble benefit so far. Results from studies combining buparlisib with differentanticancer agents - namely, endocrine therapy, anti-HER2 therapy, andchemotherapy - have showed variable efficacy with consistent substantialtoxicity.DOI: 10.2147/BCTT.S134641 PMCID: PMC5796458PMID: 29430197
