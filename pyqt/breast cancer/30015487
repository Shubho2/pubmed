Epub2018 Jul 17.Structure-Based Discovery of CF53 as a Potent and Orally Bioavailable Bromodomainand Extra-Terminal (BET) Bromodomain Inhibitor.Zhao Y, Zhou B, Bai L, Liu L, Yang CY, Meagher JL, Stuckey JA, McEachern D,Przybranowski S, Wang M, Ran X, Aguilar A, Hu Y, Kampf JW, Li X, Zhao T, Li S,Wen B, Sun D, Wang S.We report the structure-based discovery of CF53 (28) as a highly potent andorally active inhibitor of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins. By the incorporation of a NH-pyrazole group into the 9H-pyrimido[4,5- b]indole core, we identified a series of compounds that bind to BRD4 BD1 protein with Ki values of <1 nM and achieve low nanomolar potencies in the cell growth inhibition ofleukemia and breast cancer cells. The most-promising compound, CF53, possessesexcellent oral pharmacokinetic properties and achieves significant antitumoractivity in both triple-negative breast cancer and acute leukemia xenograftmodels in mice. Determination of the co-crystal structure of CF53 with the BRD4BD1 protein provides a structural basis for its high binding affinity to BETproteins. CF53 is very selective over non-BET bromodomain-containing proteins.These data establish CF53 as a potent, selective, and orally active BETinhibitor, which warrants further evaluation for advanced preclinicaldevelopment.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00483 PMID: 30015487
