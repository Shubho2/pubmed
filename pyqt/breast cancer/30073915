To overcome the nonspecific binding of actively targeted CS-NCs with normal cells, a matrix metalloproteinase(MMP-2)-degradable cationic gelatin layer was electrostatically deposited ontothe surface of the negatively-charged CS-NCs.RESULTS: The prepared nanocarriers displayed strong fluorescence which enabledtracing their internalization into cancer cells. An enhanced cytotoxicity of the NCs against breast cancer cells was demonstrated. In vivo, the nanoplatformsdisplayed superior antitumor efficacy as well as nonimmunogenic response.CONCLUSION: Therefore, these multifunctional nanoplatforms could be used aspotential cancer theranostics.DOI: 10.2217/nnm-2018-0028 PMID: 30073915
