This study was conducted in Chinese patients to determine whether stable cases of seromas would resolve without treatment.Methods: A.retrospective review of 45 consecutive cases of immediate breast reconstructionwith LD flap from April 2012 to February 2017 was conducted. The scope of theseroma was demarcated with a marker pen, and cases that remained stable over time(i.e. the size of the seroma did not increase) were observed without treatment.The measured outcomes included the incidence of seromas, the volume and duration of postoperative wound drainage, and other demographic characteristics.Results:Twenty-four patients (53.3%) developed a seroma at the donor site. Of these, 21patients (87.5%) did not require treatment, and the seroma resolved over time.The mean duration of a sustained seroma was 6.8 ± 1.4 weeks (range: 4-9 weeks).Conclusions: This study observed the scope and progression of the seromas andfound that seromas at the LD donor sites resolved over time without treatment.Publisher:即刻背阔肌皮瓣乳房重建术后供区血清肿的演变摘要背景：在中国和西方国家，背阔肌皮瓣法（LD）仍然是一个广泛应用的重建乳房方式，其中供区血清肿是主要的并发症。我们的研究目的是判断患者术后稳定的供区血清肿是否会自然吸收。方法：我们对2012年4月至2017年2月的45例即刻背阔肌皮瓣乳房重建术患者进行了回顾性分析，用记号笔标记患者供区血清肿的积液范围和对积液范围保持稳定的患者（即积液容积没有增加者）进行观察随访，测量数据包括供区血清肿发生率、血清肿容量、术后伤口引流时间和患者基本特征。结果：24例患者（53.3%）出现供区血清肿，其中21例患者的血清肿（87.5%）不需要干预而缓慢自然吸收，血清肿的平均持续时间为6.8±1.4周（范围为4-9周）。 结论：大部分即刻背阔肌皮瓣乳房重建术后稳定的供区血清肿会缓慢自然吸收。.DOI: 10.4103/0366-6999.235877 PMID: 29998886
