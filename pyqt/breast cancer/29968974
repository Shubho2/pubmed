[Epub ahead of print]Compared with intensity-modulated radiotherapy, image-guided radiotherapy reducesseverity of acute radiation-induced skin toxicity during radiotherapy in patientswith breast cancer.Lin JC(1)(2)(3), Tsai JT(1)(2), Chou YC(4), Li MH(1), Liu WH(5)(6).Author information: (1)Department of Radiation Oncology, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei MedicalUniversity, Taipei, Taiwan.(2)Department of Radiology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, TaipeiMedical University, Taipei, Taiwan.(3)Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei MedicalUniversity, Taipei, Taiwan.(4)School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.(5)Department of Neurological Surgery, Tri-Service General Hospital and National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.(6)Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, National Defense Medical Center,Taipei, Taiwan.Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective treatment for breast cancer. The side effectsof breast irradiation, including skin toxicity in the irradiation field, causeconsiderable discomfort. This study compared the severity of skin toxicity causedby image-guided RT (IGRT) and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) combined with anelectronic portal imaging device (EPID) in breast cancer. This studyretrospectively analyzed 458 patients with breast cancer who had received RT. Thepatients were divided into two groups: 302 and 156 patients in the IMRT and IGRT groups. In the IGRT group, 8 and 148 patients had received helical tomotherapyirradiation and IMRT with cone-beam computed tomography. Simple and multiplelogistic regression analyses were used to estimate the relationship between RTtechnique and the severity of radiation skin toxicity. In our study, 284, 97, and6 patients exhibited grades I, II, and III radiation dermatitis (RD). Moreover,75 patients in the IMRT group (24.80%) and 22 patients in the IGRT group (14.10%)exhibited grade II RD. All patients with grade III RD were in the IMRT group(2.00%). No patient exhibited grade IV RD. The patients in the IGRT groupexhibited less severity of RD than in the IMRT group. The severity of acute RDdue to IGRT is significantly lower than that due to IMRT with EPID.Â© 2018 The Authors.
