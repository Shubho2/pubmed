The outcome was diagnosis of breast cancer during the observationperiods (median: 4.0 years). Three analyses were conducted: 1) Incidence rateswere compared according to 25(OH)D concentration from <20 to ≥60 ng/ml (<50 to≥150 nmol/L), 2) Kaplan-Meier plots were developed and 3) multivariate Coxregression was used to examine the association between 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk using multiple 25(OH)D measurements.RESULTS: Within the pooled cohort (N = 5038), 77 women were diagnosed with breastcancer (age-adjusted incidence: 512 cases per 100,000 person-years). Results weresimilar for the three analyses. First, comparing incidence rates, there was an82% lower incidence rate of breast cancer for women with 25(OH)D concentrations≥60 vs <20 ng/ml (Rate Ratio = 0.18, P = 0.006). Second, Kaplan-Meier curves for concentrations of <20, 20-39, 40-59 and ≥60 ng/ml were significantly different (P= 0.02), with the highest proportion breast cancer-free in the ≥60 ng/ml group(99.3%) and the lowest proportion breast cancer-free in the <20 ng/ml group(96.8%). The proportion with breast cancer was 78% lower for ≥60 vs <20 ng/ml (P = 0.02). Third, multivariate Cox regression revealed that women with 25(OH)Dconcentrations ≥60 ng/ml had an 80% lower risk of breast cancer than women withconcentrations <20 ng/ml (HR = 0.20, P = 0.03), adjusting for age, BMI, smokingstatus, calcium supplement intake, and study of origin.CONCLUSIONS: Higher 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with a dose-responsedecrease in breast cancer risk with concentrations ≥60 ng/ml being mostprotective.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199265 PMCID: PMC6003691PMID: 29906273
