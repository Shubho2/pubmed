Hyaluronidases are extensivelyfound in the venom of various animals such as snake, scorpion, spider and others.Up till now five venom hyaluronidases are identified with a definedthree-dimensional structure. These enzymes are involved in different biochemical,physiological and pathological conditions like degradation of hyaluronic acid,embryogenesis, transmembrane diffusion of drugs and toxins, inflammatory andallergic response to antigens, healing of wounds, bacterial meningitis,bacteremia and pneumonia. These enzymes are used as an adjuvant therapy in cancerand to expedite the dispersion and absorption of drugs as well as to reduce thetissue edema. and to reduce the progression of metastatic breast cancer as wellas used in ophthalmological procedures in combination with local anesthetics,reduction of dermatological aging, regulation of hyaluronan, as a spreadingfactor and with numerous clinical applications.CONCLUSION: In this review an attempt was made to summarize the physiological,adjuvaent and therapeutic significance of hyaluronidase enzymes from differentanimal sources.CopyrightÂ© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/0929866525666180629121823 PMID: 29956608
