Thisstudy aimed to examine the association between consumption of cruciferousvegetables and breast cancer risk according to GSL and ITC contents in a Chinese population. A total of 1485 cases and 1506 controls were recruited into thiscase-control study from June 2007 to March 2017. Consumption of cruciferousvegetables was assessed using a validated FFQ. Dietary GSL and ITC were computed by using two food composition databases linking GSL and ITC contents incruciferous vegetables with responses to the FFQ. The OR and 95 % CI wereassessed by unconditional logistic regression after adjusting for the potentialconfounders. Significant inverse associations were found between consumption ofcruciferous vegetables, GSL and ITC and breast cancer risk. The adjusted ORcomparing the highest with the lowest quartile were 0·51 (95 % CI 0·41, 0·63) forcruciferous vegetables, 0·54 (95 % CI 0·44, 0·67) for GSL and 0·62 (95 % CI 0·50,0·76) for ITC, respectively. These inverse associations were also observed inboth premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Subgroup analysis by hormonereceptor status found inverse associations between cruciferous vegetables, GSLand ITC and both hormone-receptor-positive or hormone-receptor-negative breastcancer. This study indicated that consumption of cruciferous vegetables, GSL and ITC was inversely associated with breast cancer risk among Chinese women.DOI: 10.1017/S0007114518000600 PMID: 29644960
