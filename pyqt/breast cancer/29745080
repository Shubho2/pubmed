All of them were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and underwent MSCT scan before and after treatment to evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy. Theexpression of BCSG1 in tumor tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry and the correlation between CT results and BCSG1 was analyzed.RESULTS: MSCT evaluation of the efficacy of chemotherapy in breast cancerpatients was consistent with pathological evaluation (p<0.05). MSCT in patientsafter chemotherapy was significantly better than before chemotherapy (p<0.05). CTexamination showed that tumor diameter and lymph node size were significantlyreduced after chemotherapy (p<0.05). The positive rates of BCSG1 in patients withdifferent TNM stages after chemotherapy were significantly decreased (p<0.05) andthe CT perfusion value of BCSG1 in the low expression group was significantlyhigher than in the high expression group (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: MSCT can accurately evaluate the effect of chemotherapy in breastcancer. The results of MSCT were closely related to the expression of BCSG1,which may provide a reference for predicting the effect of chemotherapy in breastcancer which could have important clinical significance.PMID: 29745080
