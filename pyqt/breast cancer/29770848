Twenty-twopatients with BMBC who underwent treatment involving bevacizumab on day 1,etoposide on days 2-4, and cisplatin on day 2 in 21-day cycles were prospectivelyenrolled for a phase II study. Three brain MRIs were performed: before thetreatment, on day 1, and on day 21. Eight imaging biomarkers were derived fromdynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (Peak, IAUC60, K trans , k ep , v e ),diffusion-weighted imaging [apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)], and MRspectroscopy (choline/N-acetylaspartate and choline/creatine ratios). Therelative changes (Δ) in these biomarkers were correlated with the central nervoussystem (CNS)-specific progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models.RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the survival outcomes as perthe changes in the biomarkers on day 1. On day 21, those with a low ΔK trans (p =0.024) or ΔADC (p = 0.053) reduction had shorter CNS-specific PFS; further, thosewith a low ΔPeak (p = 0.012) or ΔIAUC60 (p = 0.04) reduction had shorter OScompared with those with high reductions. In multivariate analyses, ΔK trans and ΔPeak were independent prognostic factors for CNS-specific PFS and OS,respectively, after controlling for age, size, hormone receptors, and performancestatus.CONCLUSIONS: Multiparametric MRI may help predict the survival outcomes inpatients with BMBC.KEY POINTS: • Decreased angiogenesis after chemotherapy on day 21 indicated good survival outcome. • ΔK trans was an independent prognostic factors forCNS-specific PFS. • ΔPeak was an independent prognostic factors for OS. •Multiparametric MRI helps clinicians to assess patients with BMBC. • High-riskpatients may benefit from more intensive follow-up or treatment strategies.DOI: 10.1007/s00330-018-5448-5 PMID: 29770848
