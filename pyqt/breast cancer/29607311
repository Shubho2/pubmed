Despite the social inactivity and irregularity in habits, working in continuous irregular shifts causes serious health issues including sleepdisorders, psychiatric disorders, cancer, and metabolic disorders. These healthproblems arise due to the disruption in circadian clock system, which isassociated with alterations in genetic expressions. Alteration in clockcontrolling genes further affects genes linked with disorders including majordepression disorder, bipolar disorder, phase delay and phase advance sleepsyndromes, breast cancer, and colon cancer. A diverse research work is neededfocusing on broad spectrum changes caused by jet lag in brain and neuronalsystem. This review is an attempt to motivate the researchers to conduct advancedstudies in this area to identify the risk factors and mechanisms. Its goal isextended to make the shift workers aware about the risks associated withshiftwork.DOI: 10.1155/2018/8576890 PMCID: PMC5828540PMID: 29607311
