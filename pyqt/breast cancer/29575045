The synthesized derivatives were evaluated for cytotoxicity and anticancer activity in vitrousing the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)colorimetric method against VERO, HEPG2 (human hepatocellular liver carcinoma),SKOV3 (ovarian carcinoma), MCF7 (human breast adenocarcinoma), PC3 and DU145(prostate carcinoma) cells at 10-5  M (10 μM) for 24 h. Compounds 5d and 5hshowed the best biological potency against the SKOV3 cancer cell line (IC50 = 7.22 and 5.10 μM, respectively) and did not display cytotoxicity toward VEROcells compared to etodolac. Compounds 5k, 5s, and 5v showed the most potentbiological activity against the PC3 cancer cell line (IC50  = 8.18, 3.10, and4.00 μM, respectively) and did not display cytotoxicity. Moreover, thesecompounds were evaluated for caspase-3, -9, and -8 protein expression andactivation in the apoptosis pathway for 6, 12, and 24 h, which play a key role inthe treatment of cancer. In this study, we also investigated the apoptoticmechanism and molecular modeling of compounds 5k and 5v on the methionineaminopeptidase (type II) enzyme active site in order to get insights into thebinding mode and energy.© 2018 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft.DOI: 10.1002/ardp.201700195 PMID: 29575045
