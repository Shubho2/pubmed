The cohort included patients who were 66 years old or older and were diagnosed with stage II or III breast or colorectal cancer betweenJuly 1, 2007, and December 31, 2009. The Drugs to Avoid in the Elderly (DAE) listand the Beers criteria were used to identify PIM use. Univariate/multivariatelogistic regression determined the association of baseline PIMs with covariates. Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time from chemotherapy initiation tothe first emergency room (ER) visit, hospitalization, death, or a composite until3 months after chemotherapy. Cox proportional hazards modeling determined theassociation of PIMs with EFS.RESULTS: The analysis included 1595 patients with breast cancer and 1528 patientswith colorectal cancer. The baseline PIM frequencies were 22.2% (according to theDAE list) and 27.6% (according to the Beers criteria) in the breast cohort and15.5% (according to the DAE list) and 24.8% (according to the Beers criteria) in the colorectal cohort. Among patients with breast cancer, 37.5% had at least 1adverse outcome; associations included the use of ≥5 medications, an advancedstage, higher comorbidity, and prior ER visits/hospitalizations. Baseline PIM useaccording to the DAE list was associated with an increased risk of death inpatients with breast cancer. Among patients with colorectal cancer, 45% had atleast 1 adverse outcome, and associations included the use of ≥5 medications,older age, female sex, and higher comorbidity. A time-to-event analysis revealed no association between baseline PIM use and most outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: These findings require further prospective confirmation, but theysupport a correlation between polypharmacy and adverse outcomes for cancerpatients and call into question the association with PIMs. Cancer2018;124:3000-7. © 2018 American Cancer Society.© 2018 American Cancer Society.DOI: 10.1002/cncr.31403 PMCID: PMC6033638 [Available on 2019-07-15]PMID: 29689595
