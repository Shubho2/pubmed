[Epub ahead of print]GREB1 is an estrogen receptor-regulated tumour promoter that is frequentlyexpressed in ovarian cancer.Hodgkinson K(1)(2), Forrest LA(1)(2), Vuong N(1)(2), Garson K(1)(2), DjordjevicB(3), Vanderhyden BC(4)(5).Author information: (1)Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa,ON, Canada.(2)Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa,ON, Canada.(3)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital,University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.(4)Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa,ON, Canada. bvanderhyden@ohri.ca.(5)Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa,ON, Canada. bvanderhyden@ohri.ca.Estrogenic hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of developing ovariancancer, and estrogen promotes tumour initiation and growth in mouse models ofthis disease. GREB1 (Growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1) is an ESR1(estrogen receptor 1)-upregulated protein which may mediate estrogen action.GREB1 knockdown prevents hormone-driven proliferation of several breast andprostate cancer cell lines and prolongs survival of mice engrafted with ovariancancer cells, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, weexplored GREB1 function in ovarian cancer. GREB1 overexpression in ovarian cancercell lines increased cell proliferation and migration and promoted a mesenchymal morphology associated with increased Col1a2, which encodes a collagen I subunit. GREB1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted an epithelial morphologyassociated with decreased Col1a2. In human tissues, GREB1 was expressed in allESR1-expressing tissues throughout the normal female reproductive tract, inaddition to several tissues that did not show ESR1 expression. In a TMA ofovarian cancer cases, GREB1 was expressed in 75-85% of serous, endometrioid,mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas. Serous, endometrioid, and mucinous ovariancancers were almost always positive for either ESR1 or GREB1, suggesting apossible reliance on signalling through ESR1 and/or GREB1. Targeting GREB1 mayinhibit tumour-promoting pathways both downstream and independent of ESR1 and is therefore a possible treatment strategy worthy of further investigation.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0377-y PMID: 29973689
