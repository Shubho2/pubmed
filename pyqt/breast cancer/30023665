ManyEDB-FN-targeted drugs have been developed and have shown therapeutic effects inclinical trials. Molecular imaging to visualize EDB-FN-positive cancers may help select the right patients who will be benefit from EDB-FN-targeted therapy.Although a few EDB-FN-targeted imaging probes have been developed, thecomplicated manufacturing procedure and expensive material and equipment requiredlimit their application for large-scale screening of EDB-FN-positive cancerpatients. Thus, more simple and economic EDB-FN-targeted imaging probes are stillurgently needed. Previously, we have identified a breast cancer-targeted peptide,CTVRTSADC. Coincidently, it was later identified as an EDB-FN-targeted peptideand named ZD2. In this study, we found a positive correlation between the bindingactivity of the ZD2 phage and the expression level of EDB-FN in breast cancercells. Moreover, we observed the colocalization of the ZD2 peptide with EDB-FN inbreast cancer cells. Furthermore, in vivo tumor targeting of the ZD2 phage,near-infrared fluorescence imaging, and flow cytometry showed tumor-specifichoming of the ZD2 peptide in mice bearing EDB-FN-positive breast cancers.Importantly, on the basis of this EDB-FN-targeted ZD2 peptide, we developed akit-formulated probe, 99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2, for single-photon-emission computedtomography (SPECT) imaging of breast cancer. The high tumor uptake of99mTc-HYNIC-ZD2 demonstrated its feasibility for use in visualizingEDB-FN-positive breast cancers in vivo. This kit-formulated EDB-FN-targeted SPECTprobe has potential clinical applications for precision screening ofEDB-FN-positive cancer patients who may benefit from EDB-FN-targeted therapy.DOI: 10.1021/acsomega.7b00226 PMCID: PMC6044779PMID: 30023665
