The clinicaland economic burden of NAFLD is mainly due to liver-related morbidity andmortality (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma)and an increased risk of developing fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease,chronic kidney disease and certain types of extrahepatic cancers (for example,colorectal cancer and breast cancer). Additionally, there is now accumulatingevidence that NAFLD adversely affects not only the coronary arteries (promotingaccelerated coronary atherosclerosis) but also all other anatomical structures ofthe heart, conferring an increased risk of cardiomyopathy (mainly leftventricular diastolic dysfunction and hypertrophy, leading to the development of congestive heart failure), cardiac valvular calcification (mainly aortic-valvesclerosis), cardiac arrhythmias (mainly atrial fibrillation) and some cardiacconduction defects. This Review focuses on the association between NAFLD andnon-ischaemia-related cardiac disease, discusses the putative pathophysiological mechanisms and briefly summarizes current treatment options for NAFLD that might also beneficially affect cardiac disease.DOI: 10.1038/s41575-018-0010-0 PMID: 29713021
