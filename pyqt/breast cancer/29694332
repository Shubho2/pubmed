Furthermore, Ag has been known for its extensive historical backgroundfor biomedical applications. Therefore, conjugation of shape-selective Agnanostructures with graphene may provide new horizons for pharmaceuticalapplications such as cancer treatments. Here we report on the synthesis of Agnanoparticles (NPs)/reduced graphene oxide (AgNPs/RGO) conjugate nanomaterialscontaining various shapes of AgNPs by a novel and simple synthesis route usingthe deformation of dimethylformamide (DMF) as the reducing and coupling agent.The cytotoxicity and anticancer properties of AgNPs, AgNPs/RGO conjugatenanomaterials, RGO and graphene oxide (GO) were probed against MDA-MB-231 cancer and MCF-10A normal human breast cells in vitro. The AgNPs/RGO nanocompositesexhibited a strong anticancer effect by penetration and apoptosis in cancer cellsas well as the lowest influence on the viability of normal cells. It was foundthat cancer cell viability not only depends on the geometry of Ag nanostructures but also on the interaction between AgNPs and RGO nanoplatelets. It is suggested that AgNPs/RGO conjugate nanomaterials with various shapes of AgNPs is apromising therapeutic platform for cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1088/1361-6528/aac011 PMID: 29694332
