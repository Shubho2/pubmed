We assessed the contribution of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations in cancerpredisposition genes to their SN risk. Patients and Methods Whole-genomesequencing (30-fold) was performed on samples from childhood cancer survivors whowere â‰¥ 5 years since initial cancer diagnosis and participants in the St JudeLifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospectiveclinical follow-up. Germline mutations in 60 genes known to be associated withautosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndromes with moderate to highpenetrance were classified by their pathogenicity according to the AmericanCollege of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. Relative rates (RRs) and 95%CIs of SN occurrence by mutation status were estimated using multivariablepiecewise exponential regression stratified by radiation exposure. ResultsParticipants were 3,006 survivors (53% male; median age, 35.8 years [range, 7.1to 69.8 years]; 56% received radiotherapy), 1,120 SNs were diagnosed among 439survivors (14.6%), and 175 P/LP mutations were identified in 5.8% (95% CI, 5.0%to 6.7%) of survivors. Mutations were associated with significantly increasedrates of breast cancer (RR, 13.9; 95% CI, 6.0 to 32.2) and sarcoma (RR, 10.6; 95%CI, 4.3 to 26.3) among irradiated survivors and with increased rates ofdeveloping any SN (RR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 9.3), breast cancer (RR, 7.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 24.4), nonmelanoma skin cancer (RR, 11.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 41.4), and two ormore histologically distinct SNs (RR, 18.6; 95% CI, 3.5 to 99.3) amongnonirradiated survivors. Conclusion The findings support referral of allsurvivors for genetic counseling for potential clinical genetic testing, whichshould be prioritized for nonirradiated survivors with any SN and for those with breast cancer or sarcoma in the field of prior irradiation.DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2018.77.8589 PMCID: PMC6036620 [Available on 2019-07-10]PMID: 29847298
