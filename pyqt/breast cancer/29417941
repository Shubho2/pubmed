However, the origin of CTC clusters, especially intravascularaggregates, remains unknown. Here, we employ suspension culture methods to mimic CTC cluster formation in the circulation of breast cancer patients. CTC clusters generated using these methods exhibited an increased metastatic potential thatwas defined by the overexpression of heparanase (HPSE). Heparanase induced FAK-and ICAM-1-dependent cell adhesion, which promoted intravascular cellaggregation. Moreover, knockdown of heparanase or inhibition of its activity withJG6, a heparanase inhibitor, was sufficient to block the formation of cellclusters and suppress breast cancer metastasis. Our data reveal thatheparanase-mediated cell adhesion is critical for metastasis mediated byintravascular CTC clusters. We also suggest that targeting the function ofheparanase in cancer cell dissemination might limit metastatic progression.DOI: 10.1038/aps.2017.189 PMID: 29417941
