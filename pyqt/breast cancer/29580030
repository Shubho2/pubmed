Email:htamim@aub.edu.lbObjectives: Regular screening for breast cancer is associated with bettersurvival, but compliance with guidelines depends on good knowledge and attitudes.This study aimed to assess the level of breast cancer knowledge, attitudes andscreening practices in Lebanese females, and identify their socio-demographicdeterminants as well as barriers to mammography use. Methods: Thiscross-sectional study was conducted with 371 Lebanese females residing in Beirut aged 18-65 with no history of breast cancer. The questionnaire applied wasadapted from Stager and Champion. The overall knowledge score was determined withsections on general knowledge, curability, symptoms, and screening; the overallattitude score concerned attitudes towards breast cancer, screening, andbarriers; and the overall practices score was for breast self examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography. Bivariate and multivariateanalyses of socioeconomic determinants were performed for each score. Results:The mean knowledge score was 55.5±17.1% and that for attitudes was 71.9±8.3%. Forself-examination, mammography and clinical examination practices, individualmeans were 45.7±42.3%, 77.9±36.5% and 29.1±45.5%, respectively. Knowledge,attitudes and practices correlated positively with each other (p<0.0001). Thehighest average was the knowledge of symptoms (72.8±24.7%), and the lowest thatof curability (49.6±25.7%). Most frequent barriers to mammography were fear oflearning bad news, pain, costs, and staff unpleasantness. Higher education wasassociated with better knowledge (p=0.002) and smoking with lower levels(p=0.003). Older age (p=0.002), higher education (p=0.02), and taking exercise(p=0.02) were associated with better attitudes. Higher education (p=0.02) andhaving children (p=0.003) were associated with better practices. Conclusion: Moreemphasis should be placed on educating females on the curability of breast cancerand specific targeting of the barriers identified.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.3.625 PMCID: PMC5980832PMID: 29580030
