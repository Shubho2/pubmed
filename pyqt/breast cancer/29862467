It is well known that the interpatient variability in pharmacokineticexposure is high for these agents and exposure-response relationships exist formany oral anti-hormonal drugs. Yet, they are still administered at fixed doses.This could lead to underdosing and thus suboptimal efficacy in some patients,while other patients could be overdosed resulting in unnecessary side effects.Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), individualized dosing based on measured blood concentrations of the drug, could therefore be a valid option to further optimizetreatment. In this review, we provide an overview of relevant clinicalpharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of oral anti-hormonal drugsin oncology and translate these into practical guidelines for TDM. For someagents, TDM targets are not well established yet and as a reference the medianpharmacokinetic exposure could be targeted (exemestane: minimum plasmaconcentration (Cmin) 4.1 ng/mL and enzalutamide: Cmin 11.4 mg/L). However, formost drugs, exposure-efficacy analyses could be translated into specific targets (abiraterone: Cmin 8.4 ng/mL, anastrozole: Cmin 34.2 ng/mL, and letrozole: Cmin85.6 ng/mL). Moreover, prospective clinical trials have shown TDM to be feasible for tamoxifen, for which the exposure-efficacy threshold of its active metaboliteendoxifen is 5.97 ng/mL. Based on the available data, we therefore conclude that individualized dosing based on drug concentrations is feasible and promising for oral anti-hormonal drugs and should be developed further and implemented intoclinical practice.DOI: 10.1007/s40262-018-0683-0 PMID: 29862467
