In the era of multimodality therapy, the debate on the value ofrevision surgery for compromised margins continues, and high re-excision ratespersist despite updated guidelines. Our study sought to identify the localre-excision rate for compromised margins after lumpectomy, and identifypredictors of residual disease at re-excision.METHODS: This population-based retrospective cohort study included women withbreast cancer who underwent a lumpectomy between 2009 and 2012 in Manitoba, with close (≤ 2 mm) or positive margins that led to re-excision. Patient demographics and tumor characteristics were identified through provincial cancer registriesand chart reviews. For patients with invasive cancer, the six anatomical margins were reported for margin status, width, and pathology type at the margin.RESULTS: Of the 2494 patients identified, 556 women underwent re-excision,yielding a re-excision rate of 22.29%. Of our 311 patients with invasive cancerwho underwent re-excision, 62.7% had residual disease identified on revision. On univariable analysis, the size and grade of the invasive component, nodal stage, and the number of positive margins were associated with residual disease onre-excision (p < 0.05). With the exception of nodal stage, the same variablesremained statistically significant on multivariable analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that even in the absence of 'no ink on tumor',the cancer size and grade in lumpectomy specimens are high-risk factors forresidual disease, and this subgroup of patients may benefit from re-excision.Long-term follow-up of this cohort is required to determine their risk ofrecurrence after adjuvant treatment.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6454-1 PMID: 29748884
