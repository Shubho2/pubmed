Radioactive iodine (RAI) is considered effective forpatients with total or nearly total thyroidectomy, but the beneficial effects of RAI are still controversial.Materials and methods: To determine whether RAI therapy could improve thesurvival rates of PTC patients, we conducted a retrospective analysis using data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Disease-specific survival (DSS) was obtained using multivariateCox proportional hazard regressions.Results: DSS was improved by RAI ablation in patients with tumor >2 cm, age >45years and gross extrathyroidal or lymph node metastasis. In a further analysis,RAI therapy did not improve the DSS in patients with tumor <2 cm except thosewith distant metastasis. For patients with tumor >2 cm, those involving grossextrathyroidal extension, age >45 years or disease in the lymph nodes, DSS wasimproved after RAI therapy. Patients with distant metastasis always benefitedfrom RAI ablation.Conclusion: RAI ablation should be recommended to patients with tumor <2 cm anddistant metastasis or patients with tumor >2 cm and one of the following riskfactors: gross extrathyroidal extension, age >45 years, lymph node and distantmetastases.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S160752 PMCID: PMC6016280PMID: 29950860
