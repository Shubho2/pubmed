Despite this benefit, their efficacy as single agents is limited, unlike the robust responses to other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors like EGFR inhibitors in EGFR-mutant lung cancer. Interestingly, the lack of HER2i efficacy occurs despite sufficient intracellular signaling shutdown following HER2i treatment. Exploring possibleintrinsic causes for this lack of response, we uncovered remarkably depressedlevels of NOXA, an endogenous inhibitor of the antiapoptotic MCL-1, inHER2-amplified breast cancer. Upon investigation of the mechanism leading to low NOXA, we identified a micro-RNA encoded in an intron of HER2, termed miR-4728,that targets the mRNA of the Estrogen Receptor α (ESR1). Reduced ESR1 expression in turn prevents ERα-mediated transcription of NOXA, mitigating apoptosisfollowing treatment with the HER2i lapatinib. Importantly, resistance can beovercome with pharmacological inhibition of MCL-1. More generally, while manycancers like EGFR-mutant lung cancer are driven by activated kinases that whendrugged lead to robust monotherapeutic responses, we demonstrate that theefficacy of targeted therapies directed against oncogenes active through focalamplification may be mitigated by coamplified genes.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).
