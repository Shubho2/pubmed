Recently, a newersubcutaneous formulation was shown to have comparable efficacy to the initialintravenous trastuzumab. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact ofsubcutaneous trastuzumab on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) ofpatients diagnosed with early or metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.Methods: Patients were provided with the EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organization forthe Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30) andthe BR-23 questionnaires. The scoring of questionnaires and patient'ssociodemographic and clinicopathologic characteristics were recorded and analyzedby descriptive and correlation statistics employing t test and 2-way analysis of variance.Results: A total of 163 patients agreed to participate in the study. About 90 of 163 patients (55.21%) received subcutaneous trastuzumab and 21 patientsintravenous trastuzumab (12.88%). A control group of 52 HER2+ patients receivedchemotherapy without trastuzumab (31.90%). Patients receiving subcutaneoustrastuzumab were older and of more advanced disease stage compared with thosereceiving chemotherapy (58.5 vs 51 years, 39.8% vs 28.8% advanced disease). Inunivariate analysis, subcutaneous trastuzumab was associated with less nausea andvomiting (P = .002) but worse cognitive function (P = .013) and dyspnea (P =.042). Patients who have received >8 cycles of subcutaneous trastuzumab reported less diarrhea (P = .049) and systemic therapy side effects (P = .015).Multivariate analysis showed that patients without comorbidity receivingsubcutaneous trastuzumab had less treatment side effects, less upset by hairloss, and higher emotional functioning. Of note, mastectomy and subcutaneoustrastuzumab were associated with improved role functioning (P = .021). Inmetastatic disease, no negative impact of subcutaneous trastuzumab on HRQoL wasfound.Conclusions: The administration of subcutaneous trastuzumab improved certainsymptoms and did not adversely affect most of the assessed functional scales.Particularly, in the metastatic setting, subcutaneous trastuzumab had no negativeimpact on HRQoL.DOI: 10.1177/1178223418758031 PMCID: PMC5826003PMID: 29511355
