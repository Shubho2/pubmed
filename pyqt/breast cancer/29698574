However,the association between N-glycans secreted by breast tumor and correspondingclinical relevance remain to be elucidated. We profiled N-glycans by HILIC UPLCacross a discovery dataset composed of tumor interstitial fluids (TIF, n = 85),paired normal interstitial fluids (NIF, n = 54) and serum samples (n = 28)followed by independent evaluation, with the ultimate goal of identifyingtumor-related N-glycan patterns in blood of patients with breast cancer. Thesegregation of N-linked oligosaccharides revealed 33 compositions, whichexhibited differential abundances between TIF and NIF. TIFs were depleted ofbisecting N-glycans, which are known to play essential roles in tumorsuppression. An increased level of simple high mannose N-glycans in TIF strongly correlated with the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes within tumor. Atthe same time, a low level of highly complex N-glycans in TIF inverselycorrelated with the presence of infiltrating lymphocytes within tumor. Survivalanalysis showed that patients exhibiting increased TIF abundance of GP24 hadbetter outcomes, whereas low levels of GP10, GP23, GP38, and coreF wereassociated with poor prognosis. Levels of GP1, GP8, GP9, GP14, GP23, GP28, GP37, GP38, and coreF were significantly correlated between TIF and paired serumsamples. Cross-validation analysis using an independent serum dataset supportedthe observed correlation between TIF and serum, for five of nine N-glycan groups:GP8, GP9, GP14, GP23, and coreF. Collectively, our results imply that profilingof N-glycans from proximal breast tumor fluids is a promising strategy fordetermining tumor-derived glyco-signature(s) in the blood. N-glycans structuresvalidated in our study may serve as novel biomarkers to improve the diagnosticand prognostic stratification of patients with breast cancer.© 2018 The Authors.
