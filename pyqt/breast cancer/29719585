This fact and plethora of genepolymorphism data prompted us to investigate IL1 gene polymorphisms in breastcancer (BC) patients. Totally, 530 patients with BC and 628 healthy control womenwere studied. The genetic polymorphisms for IL1 were analyzed by MassarraySequencing method. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified inIL1B, IL1R1 gene are thought to influence breast cancer risk. The results of the association between IL-1B, IL1R1 polymorphisms and breast cancer risk havesignificant. We found that the variant TT genotype of rs10490571 was associatedwith a significantly increased breast cancer risk (TT vs. CC: OR = 2.82, 95% CI =1.12-7.08, P = 0.047 for the codominant model). For rs16944 (AG vs. GG: OR =0.60, 95% CI = 0.41-0.90, P = 0.034 for the codominant model) and rs1143623 (CGvs. CC: OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.45-0.94, P = 0.023 for the codominant model) havesignificant associations were found in genetic models. In conclusion, the presentanalysis suggests a correlation of polymorphic markers within the IL-1 gene locuswith the risk in developing breast cancer. Taken together with our finding thatIL1B, IL1R1 gene three SNP are also associated with the risk for the disease, we suggest that inflammation via innate and adaptive immunity contributes tomultifactorial hereditary predisposition to pathogenesis of the breast cancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23157 PMCID: PMC5915052PMID: 29719585
