However, the exactunderlying biological mechanism for CRCI is not yet well understood. We utilized susceptibility-weighted imaging with quantitative susceptibility mapping, anon-invasive MRI-based technique, to assess longitudinal iron deposition insubcortical gray matter structures and evaluate its association with cognitiveperformance in women age 60+ with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapyand age-matched women without breast cancer as controls. Brain MRI scans andneurocognitive scores from the NIH Toolbox for Cognition were obtained beforechemotherapy (time point 1) and within one month after the last infusion ofchemotherapy for the patients and at matched intervals for the controls (timepoint 2). There were 14 patients age 60+ with breast cancer (mean age66.3 ± 5.3 years) and 13 controls (mean age 68.2 ± 6.1 years) included in thisstudy. Brain iron increased as age increased. There were no significant between- or within- group differences in neurocognitive scores or iron deposition at time point 1 or between time points 1 and 2 (p > 0.01). However, there was a negative correlation between iron in the globus pallidus and the fluid cognition compositescores in the control group at time point 1 (r = -0.71; p < 0.01), but not in thechemotherapy group. Baseline iron in the putamen was negatively associated withchanges in the oral reading recognition scores in the control group (r = 0.74,p < 0.01), but not in the chemotherapy group. Brain iron assessment did notindicate cancer or chemotherapy related short-term differences, yet someassociations with cognition were observed. Studies with larger samples and longerfollow-up intervals are warranted.Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.DOI: 10.1016/j.mri.2018.07.016 PMID: 30076946
