Mullick Road, Kolkata-700032, India. icsb8@iacs.res.inicrm@iacs.res.in.The present study aims to formulate a common synthetic strategy for preparingquantum dots (QDs) in a greener way by using combination of popular methods, viz.a colloidal method with suitable capping agent and low molecular weight gel basedsynthesis. Pyridine dicarboxylic acid (PDC) in presence of AlCl3 forms a stablemetallogel, which serves as an excellent medium for selective ZnS QD synthesis.The aromatic pyridine moiety, well known for being a capping agent, indeed plays its part in the run up to QD synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is thefirst example of a metallogel based doped ZnS QD synthesis. Altering the dopingmaterial and its composition changes the properties of the QDs, but herein wealso tried to establish how these changes affect the gel morphology and stabilityof both gel and QDs. We further demonstrate, by using live cell confocalmicroscopy, the delivery of QDs Cu ZnS and MnZnS nanomaterials in the nucleus andthe cytoplasm of human breast cancer cells (MCF7), implicating the use ofmetallogel based QDs for bio-imaging and bio-labeling.DOI: 10.1039/c7dt03864j PMID: 29697103
