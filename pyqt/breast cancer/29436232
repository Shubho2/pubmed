Epub2018 Feb 21.Drug Clearance from Cerebrospinal Fluid Mediated by Organic Anion Transporters 1 (Slc22a6) and 3 (Slc22a8) at Arachnoid Membrane of Rats.Zhang Z(1), Tachikawa M(1), Uchida Y(1), Terasaki T(1).Author information: (1)Division of Membrane Transport and Drug Targeting, Graduate School ofPharmaceutical Sciences , Tohoku University , Sendai 980-8578 , Japan.Although arachnoid mater epithelial cells form the blood-arachnoid barrier (BAB),acting as a blood-CSF interface, it has been generally considered that the BAB isimpermeable to water-soluble substances and plays a largely passive role. Here,we aimed to clarify the function of transporters at the BAB in regulating CSFclearance of water-soluble organic anion drugs based on quantitative targetedabsolute proteomics (QTAP) and in vivo analyses. Protein expression levels of 61 molecules, including 19 ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporters and 32solute-carrier (SLC) transporters, were measured in plasma membrane fraction ofrat leptomeninges using QTAP. Thirty-three proteins were detected; others wereunder the quantification limits. Expression levels of multidrug resistanceprotein 1 (Mdr1a/P-gp/Abcb1a) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp/Abcg2)were 16.6 and 3.27 fmol/μg protein (51.9- and 9.82-fold greater than in choroidplexus, respectively). Among those organic anion transporters detected only atleptomeninges, not choroid plexus, organic anion transporter 1 (oat1/Slc22a6)showed the greatest expression (2.73 fmol/μg protein). On the other hand, theprotein expression level of oat3 at leptomeninges was 6.65 fmol/μg protein, andthe difference from choroid plexus was within two-fold. To investigate oat1'srole, we injected para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) with or without oat1 inhibitorsinto cisterna magna (to minimize the contribution of choroid plexus function) of rats. A bulk flow marker, FITC-inulin, was not taken up from CSF up to 15 min,whereas uptake clearance of PAH was 26.5 μL/min. PAH uptake was completelyblocked by 3 mM cephalothin (inhibits both oat1 and oat3), while 17% of PAHuptake was inhibited by 0.2 mM cephalothin (selectively inhibits oat3). Theseresults indicate that oat1 and oat3 at the BAB provide a distinct clearancepathway of organic anion drugs from CSF independently of choroid plexus.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b00852 PMID: 29436232
