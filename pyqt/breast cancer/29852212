Forty New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into twogroups. The axillary LN models were created by inoculating VX2 cell suspensionand complete Freund's adjuvant in the mammary glands of 20 female rabbits of eachgroup, respectively. Conventional MRI and IVIM DWI were performed after animalmodels successfully established. Images of axillary LNs were analyzed with regardto long-axis diameter (L), short-axis diameter (S), apparent diffusioncoefficient (ADC) and IVIM parameters (D, D*, f). Receiver operatingcharacteristic analyses were conducted to determine the diagnostic performance ofaforementioned criteria.RESULTS: A total of 42 metastatic and 30 non-metastatic LNs were successfullyisolated. ADC and D of metastatic LNs were significantly lower than those ofnon-metastatic ones (all P < 0.001), whereas D* was statistically higher(P = 0.033). L, S, and f showed no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.089, 0.058, 0.054, respectively). Optimal cutoff values, area under thecurve, sensitivity, and specificity for differentiation were as follows:ADC = 1.101 × 10-3 mm2/s, 0.886, 78.6%, 90.0%; D = 0.938 × 10-3 mm2/s, 0.927,83.3%, 93.3%; and D* = 12.635 × 10-3 mm2/s, 0.657, 52.4%, 80.0%.CONCLUSION: IVIM DWI is useful to distinguish metastatic from non-metastatic LNs in axilla. D was the most discriminative variable for predicting metastatic LNs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.mri.2018.05.013 PMID: 29852212
