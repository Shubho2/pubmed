We evaluated the frequency of incompletereports in mobile mammography screening and the relationships between priormammograms and recall rates.METHODS: The frequency of incomplete mammogram reports, the subgroups of thoseneeding prior comparison mammograms, recalls for additional imaging, andavailability of prior mammograms of a mobile screening mammography unit werecompared with fixed site mammography from January 1, 2007 through December 31,2009. All mobile unit mammograms were full field digital mammography (FFDM).Differences between rates of recall, incomplete reports, and availability ofprior mammograms were calculated using the Chi-Square statistic.RESULTS: Of 2640 mobile mammography cases, 21.9% (578) reports were incomplete,versus 15.2% (7653) (p ≤ 0.001) of 50325 fixed site reports. Of incomplete cases,recall for additional imaging occurred among 8.3% (218) of mobile mammographyreports versus 11.3% (5708) (p ≤ 0.001) of fixed site reports. Prior mammogramswere needed among 13.6% (360) of mobile mammography versus 3.9% (1945)(p ≤ 0.001) of fixed site reports. Mobile mammography recall rate varied withavailability of prior mammograms: 16.0% (54) when no prior mammograms, 7.6% (127)when prior mammograms were elsewhere but unavailable and 5.9% (37) when priorFFDM were immediately available (p ≤ 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete reports were more frequent in mobile mammography than thefixed site. The availability of prior comparison mammograms at time ofinterpretation decreased the rate of incomplete mammogram reports. Recall rateswere higher without prior comparison mammograms and lowest when comparison FFDMmammograms were available.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4861-4 PMID: 29951970
