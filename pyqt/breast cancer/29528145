Aberrant expression of BMI1 is associated with metastasis and poorprognosis in cancer patients. At present, therapy reagents that can efficientlyinhibit the expression of BMI1 are not very well known. Here, we report thatTimosaponin A-III (TA-III), a steroidal saponin obtained from the rhizomes of an herb, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, strongly inhibits expression of BMI1 in breastcancer cells. Treatment of breast cancer cells with TA-III resulted in inhibitionof oncogenic phenotypes such as proliferation, migration and invasion, andinduction of cellular senescence. Inhibition of these oncogenic phenotypes wasaccompanied by downregulation of BMI1 expression and histone posttranslationalmodification activity of PRC1. The mechanistic analysis of TA-III-inducedinhibition of oncogenic activity and BMI1 expression suggests that downregulationof c-Myc mediates TA-III effect on BMI1. We further show that exogenous BMI1overexpression can overcome TA-III-induced inhibition of oncogenic phenotypes. Wealso show that TA-III induces expression of tumor suppressive miR-200c andmiR-141, which are negatively regulated by BMI1. In summary, our data suggestthat TA-III is a potent inhibitor of BMI1 and that it can be successfully used toinhibit the growth of tumors where PcG protein BMI1 and PcG activities areupregulated.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/mc.22804 PMCID: PMC5986597 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29528145
