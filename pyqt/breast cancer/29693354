Email: shatha.ahmed@uoninevah.edu.iqBackground and objectives: To date, many tumor markers have been used to predict prognosis and therapeutic response in patients with breast cancer. The wellestablished and routinely applied tumor markers are the estrogen-receptor,progesterone-receptor and Her2/neu-receptor. In the current study, we aimed tohighlight any association of the proliferation index (Ki67) in breastinfiltrative duct carcinoma with the tumor grade, tumor size and nodal status in addition to hormone receptor status. Tissue sections were stainedimmunohistochemically for Ki67 nuclear antigen, estrogen, progesterone andHer2/neu receptors using an automated Dako machine (Dako Denmark. There was asignificant inverse relationship of Ki67 levels with ER and PR, while values weredirectly proportional to the tumor grade and Her2/neu status. No significantassociation was found between Ki67 and size of tumor or nodal status. Ki67immunoexpression may offer an independent predictive tumor marker and for routineapplication in cases of breast cancer.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.4.955 PMCID: PMC6031788PMID: 29693354
