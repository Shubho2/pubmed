In the present study, plasma samples derived from 7 patientswith metastatic and non-metastatic ER+ (estrogen receptor positive) breast cancer(BC) were collected and their respective (EVs) isolated and the protein contentanalyzed by mass spectrometry and FunRich analysis. Two putative plasmabiomarkers (absent in healthy controls samples) were identified which could beused to detect early ER+ breast cancer and for those with lymph node (LN)involvement However, given the current limitations of the EV isolation methodused, it is possible that these biomarkers did not originate from EVs and mayrepresent blood-derived extracellular proteins. Â Further work in a larger patientcohort is warranted to confirm these findings and examine the diagnosticpotential of these biomarkers.DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.14129.3 PMCID: PMC6008847PMID: 29946439
