Patients were categorized as breast-conserving surgery (BCS), UnilateralMastectomy and CPM group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions wereapplied to assess the factors associated with undergoing CPM among mastectomypatients. The trends of CPM among mastectomy patients through year were presentedby different subgroups of sociodemographic and pathological characteristics.RESULTS: Of those, 105326 patients with DCIS were identified, and 6370 patientsunderwent CPM. The proportion of CPM was 6.05% for all surgically-treatedpatients and 21.09% for mastectomy patients, and it increased more than six-fold between 1998 and 2013 (from 1.74% to 10.89% for all surgically-treated patientsand from 5.44% to 37.47% for mastectomy patients). Younger age, white race,married status, smaller tumor size, positive ER and PR status were significantly associated with higher CPM proportion among mastectomy patients. The proportionof CPM was increasing through year, and the increasing trends were obvious in thesubgroups of younger, white, married, metropolitan, with higher bachelor degreeand higher median family income patients, while there were no apparentdifferences in the trends between subgroups of pathological characteristics.CONCLUSION: The trends of CPM among mastectomy patients were increasing throughyears and influenced by patients' sociodemographic characteristics, but notpathological characteristics.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
