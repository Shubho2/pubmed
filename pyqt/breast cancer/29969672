[Epubahead of print]A transcriptomic analysis of black cohosh: Actein alters cholesterol biosynthesispathways and synergizes with simvastatin.Einbond LS(1), Soffritti M(2), Esposti DD(3), Wu HA(4), Balick M(5), Ma H(4),Redenti S(6), Roter A(7).Author information: (1)The New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, NY, 10458, USA; Lehman College and theGraduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA; ColumbiaUniversity College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, 10032, USA.Electronic address: linda.einbond@lehman.cuny.edu.(2)National Institute for the Study and Control of Tumors and EnvironmentalDiseases "B.

This study assessed the transcriptomiceffects of black cohosh and actein on rat liver tissue, using Ingenuity and ToxFXanalyses. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with an extract of black cohoshenriched in triterpene glycosides (27%) for 24 h or actein for 6 and 24 h, at35.7 mg/kg, and liver tissue collected for gene expression analysis. Ingenuityanalysis indicates the top canonical pathways are, for black cohosh, RARActivation, and, for actein, Superpathway of Cholesterol Biosynthesis, at 24 h.Actein alters the expression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes, but does notinhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity. Black cohosh and actein inhibited the growth of human breast and colon cancer cells and synergized with the statinsimvastatin. Combinations of black cohosh with certain classes of statins couldenhance their activity, as well as toxic, such as inflammatory liver, sideeffects. Transcriptomic analysis indicates black cohosh and actein warrantfurther study to prevent and treat cancer and lipid disorders. This study laysthe basis for an approach to characterize the mode of action and toxicity ofherbal medicines.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
