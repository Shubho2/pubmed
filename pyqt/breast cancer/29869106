However, as for many oncology drugs, the dose of targeted therapies may need to be adjusted over time, leading to drug wastagewhen a dose modification is needed but the dose cannot be split or saved. Thishas been shown to be the case for palbociclib and has led to concerns amongpayers. This study described palbociclib dosing patterns and estimated theeconomic burden of the drug wastage associated with palbociclib dosemodifications in postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC.METHODS: A large US claims database was used to identify postmenopausal womenwith HR+/HER2- mBC who received a palbociclib-based therapy during one of theirfirst three lines of therapy for mBC between February 2015 (palbociclib approval)and December 2015. Dosing patterns (dosing modifications and sequences) werereported; a dose modification was defined as an increase/decrease of at least25 mg daily compared to the preceding dose. Estimates of drug wastage costs were based on days with overlap in prescription fills for different palbociclib doses.RESULTS: A total of 473 postmenopausal palbociclib-treated women with HR+/HER2-mBC were included (first line 214; second line 157; third line 120). Over anaverage duration of line of therapy of approximately 4 months, dose modification was observed in 17.8%, 31.2%, and 35.0% of patients in first, second, and thirdline. Average overlap in prescription fills was 9.2, 9.9, and 5.4 days in first, second, and third line. This potential drug wastage resulted in an average costof $4376, $4740, and $2592 per patient in first, second, and third line.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that drug wastage due to palbociclib dosemodification results in substantial costs. Treatment options with more flexibledosing may help reduce the costs of drug wastage.FUNDING: Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.DOI: 10.1007/s12325-018-0701-5 PMID: 29869106
