Methods: Data from a national populationbasedcross-sectional household survey in South Africa in 2012 for 10,831 women aged30+ years were analysed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression.The outcome variables were cervical cancer screening (Papanicolaou smear test)and breast cancer screening (mammography). Exposure variables weresociodemographic factors, lifestyle variables, and chronic conditions. Results:The prevalences of Papanicolaou (PAP) smear test and mammography participationwere 52.0% and 13.4%, respectively. On multivariable logistic regressionanalysis, women with higher education, those who were non-black African, havingmedical aid and having chronic conditions were more likely to undergo a Pap smeartest and mammography. Living in rural areas was related to a lower likelihood of receiving both types of screening. In addition, undertaking moderate or vigorous physical activity was associated with breast cancer screening. Conclusion:Screening for cervical cancer was relatively high but for breast cancer it waslow, despite the latter being a major public health problem in South Africa. Thismay be attributed to the limited availability, affordability, and accessibilityof breast cancer screening services among socio-economically disadvantagedindividuals There are some socio-economic disparities in adopting both breast andcervical cancer screening guidelines that could be targeted by interventions.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.6.1465 PMID: 29936716
