As a result, a single-ligand nanoparticle cannot accountfor the continuously changing expression of targetable biomarkers over time andspace. To effectively direct nanoparticles to metastasis, we developed amulti-ligand nanoparticle by using four different types of ligands on the samenanoparticle that target biomarkers on the endothelium associated with metastaticdisease. These vascular targets included αvβ3 integrin, P-selectin, EGFR andfibronectin. Using terminal and in vivo imaging studies, the targetingperformance of the multi-ligand nanoparticles was compared to the single-ligandnanoparticle variants. All four single-ligand nanoparticle variants achievedsignificant targeting of lung metastasis in the 4T1 mouse model of breast cancer metastasis with about 2.5% of the injected dose being deposited into metastasis. A dual-ligand nanoparticle resulted in a nearly 2-fold higher deposition intolung metastases than its single-ligand counterparts. The multi-ligandnanoparticle significantly outperformed its targeting nanoparticle counterpartsachieving a deposition of ∼7% of its injected nanoparticles into lung metastases.Using the high sensitivity of radionuclide imaging, PET imaging showed that amulti-ligand nanoparticle labeled with [18F]fluoride was able to precisely targetmetastatic disease at its very early stage of development in three differentanimal models of metastatic breast cancer.DOI: 10.1039/c8nr02513d PMCID: PMC5908762 [Available on 2019-04-19]PMID: 29620124
