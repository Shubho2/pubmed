OX40L (also known as TNFSF4), a membrane protein, which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor super family binds to its receptor OX40 andthis co-stimulation has a crucial role in T cell proliferation, survival andcytokine release. Previous studies have shown that OX40L is associated withcancer. Due to the importance of the T cells in antitumor activities of OX40L we studied the association of rs3850641 (A→G) polymorphism of OX40L gene with thebreast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 123 women with breast cancer and126 healthy volunteers with no signs of cancer. Genomic DNA was extracted fromblood leucocytes. Genotype and allele frequencies were determined in patients andcontrol cases with the method of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragmentlength polymorphism and the statistical analysis was performed by Med Calc.RESULTS: The prevalence of genotype frequencies of AA/AG/GG were 60.9%, 30.08%and 8.9% in patients with breast cancer cases and 74.6%, 18.25% and 7.14% inhealthy volunteers while the A and G allelic frequency was 76.01 and 23.98% inpatients and 83.73 and 16.26% in healthy controls, respectively. Statisticalanalysis has shown signiﬁcant difference from the comparison of genotype (p =0.03).CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the rs3850641 SNP is significantly associatedwith the breast cancer susceptibility in Iranian population. However, furtherstudies in larger populations including other genetic and environmental factorsare required to achieve conclusion.PMID: 29949525
