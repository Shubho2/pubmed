In this paper, injectable supramoleculargels formed by self-assembly of low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs) based onglycylglycine modified phenylboronic acid were prepared to localize ethanol andload chemotherapeutic drug for in situ synergistic therapy. The mechanism,morphology and rheological property of supramolecular gels were characterized by NMR, UV, SEM, etc. The rheological study revealed that the gels were formed insitu rapidly and recovered promptly once damaged. The gels were non-toxicity toboth normal 3T3 fibroblasts cells and 4T1 breast cancer cells. Doxorubicin (DOX) hydrochloride and ethanol were encapsulated in the gels for the combination ofchemotherapy and PEI therapy. The in vivo anticancer activity of the DOX-loadedgels was carried out in tumour bearing mice. The injected gels were coated aroundtumour tissues to lock ethanol, and DOX was released sustainingly from the gelsto maintain effective concentration to induce the apoptosis of tumour cells.DOX-loaded gels and the ethanol exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy and low side effects in local cancer therapy.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1468766 PMID: 29741394
