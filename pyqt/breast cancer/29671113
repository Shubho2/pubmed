We used logistic regression toevaluate associations between tertiles of social support and non-initiation (< 2 consecutive prescription fills within a year after diagnosis). Among those whoinitiated treatment, we used proportional hazards regression to evaluateassociations with discontinuation (≥ 90 day gap) and non-adherence (< 80% medicalpossession ratio).RESULTS: Of those who initiated AET (79%), approximately one-fourth eitherdiscontinued AET or were non-adherent. AET non-initiation was more likely inwomen with moderate (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.96-1.46) or low (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.62) versus high personal social support (P trend = 0.02). Women withmoderate (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.99-1.45) or low (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.60) personal social support were also more likely to discontinue treatment (P trend = 0.01).Furthermore, women with moderate (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.53) or low (HR 1.38, 95%CI 1.12-1.70) personal social support had higher non-adherence (P trend = 0.007).Associations with clinical social support and outcomes were similar. Notably,high clinical social support mitigated the risk of discontinuation when patients'personal support was moderate or low (P value = 0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Women with low personal or clinical social support had higher AETnon-adherence. Clinician teams may need to fill support gaps that compromisetreatment adherence.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4774-2 PMCID: PMC6026067 [Available on 2019-08-01]PMID: 29671113
