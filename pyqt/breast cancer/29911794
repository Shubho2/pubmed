Post-mastectomy post-radiotherapy (PMPR) lymphedema is related todamages to lymphatics and/or veins during/after axillary surgery andradiotherapy. The management of this condition is very challenging; thecomprehensive decongestive therapy (CTD), which combines physiotherapy,self-management, and hygiene, and is currently considered the standard management(SM). The aim of this registry study was to evaluate whether the supplementation with Robuvit® as a lymphedema controlling agent added to CTD over a 2-monthperiod could be more effective than CTD alone.METHODS: A group of 65 patients with PMPR lymphedema was included in thisregistry study and followed up for 2 months; 33 were treated with current SM only(control group), and 32 were also supplemented with 600 mg/day of Robuvit®(active treatment group).RESULTS: At 1- and 2-month follow-up, the decrease in volume was significantlygreater in the supplement group (P<0.05), with a final reduction in volume after two months of 654±21 mL (-19.82%) versus 433±23 mL (-12.81%) in the controlgroup. A more significant decrease in skin thickness and symptoms was alsoobserved in the Robuvit® group. No side effects were reported.CONCLUSIONS: CTD, combined with self-management, can effectively control theexcess of limb volume in post-mastectomy lymphedema. Supplementation withRobuvit® is useful to further reduce limb volume. Later stages of lymphedema seemto be more difficult to manage and may require surgery or more invasivetreatments.DOI: 10.23736/S0026-4733.18.07667-8 PMID: 29911794
