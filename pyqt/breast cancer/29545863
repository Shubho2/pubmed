China.(2)School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130021, P.R. China.To investigate the effects of triptolide (TPI) on proliferation, autophagy anddeath in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and to elucidate the associatedmolecular mechanisms, intracellular alterations were analyzed using3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flowcytometry assays. The results of the MTT assay revealed that TPI significantlyreduced the MCF-7 cell survival rate when the concentration was >10 nmol/l. TPIactivated a caspase cascade reaction by regulating Bcl-2-associated X protein(Bax), caspase-3 and B-cell lymphoma 2 expression, and promoted programmed celldeath via the mitochondrial pathway. The results demonstrated that TPIsignificantly reduced the cell proliferation rate and viability in a time- anddose-dependent manner, which was confirmed by western blotting andimmunofluorescent staining. TPI induced autophagy and influenced p38mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase(Erk)1/2, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation, whichresulted in apoptosis. When cells were treated with a combination of TPI and the Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126, the downregulation of P62 and upregulation of Bax wereinhibited, which demonstrated that the inhibition of Erk1/2 reversed theautophagy changes induced by TPI. The results indicated that Erk1/2 activationmay be a novel mechanism by which TPI induces autophagy and apoptosis in MCF-7breast cancer cells. In conclusion, TPI affects the proliferation and apoptosisof MCF-7 cells, potentially via autophagy and p38/Erk/mTOR phosphorylation. Thepresent study offers a novel view of the mechanisms by which TPI regulates celldeath.DOI: 10.3892/etm.2018.5830 PMCID: PMC5841063PMID: 29545863
