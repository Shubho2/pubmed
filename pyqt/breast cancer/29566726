This study explored novel serum proteins as surrogate markers ofprognosis in patients with EOBC.METHODS: Serum samples from EOBC patients (stages 1-3) were analysed usingagnostic high-precision quantitative proteomics. Patients receivedanthracycline-based chemotherapy. The discovery cohort (n = 399) either had more than 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) (good outcome group, n = 203) or DFS ofless than 2 years (poor outcome group, n = 196). Expressed proteins were assessedfor differential expression between the two groups. Bioinformatics pathway andnetwork analysis in combination with literature research were used to determineclinically relevant proteins. ELISA analysis against an independent sample setfrom the Prospective study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breastcancer (POSH) cohort (n = 181) was used to validate expression levels of theselected target. Linear and generalized linear modelling was applied to determinethe effect of target markers, body mass index (BMI), lymph node involvement (LN),oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status on patients' outcome.RESULTS: A total of 5346 unique proteins were analysed (peptide FDR p â‰¤ 0.05). Ofthese, 812 were differentially expressed in the good vs poor outcome groups andshowed significant enrichment for the insulin signalling (p = 0.01) and theglycolysis/gluconeogenesis (p = 0.01) pathways. These proteins further correlatedwith interaction networks involving glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Aconsistent nodal protein to these metabolic networks was resistin (upregulated inthe good outcome group, p = 0.009). ELISA validation demonstrated resistin to be upregulated in the good outcome group (p = 0.04), irrespective of BMI and ERstatus. LN involvement was the only covariate with a significant association withresistin measurements (p = 0.004). An ancillary in-silico observation was theinduction of the inflammatory response, leucocyte infiltration, lymphocytemigration and recruitment of phagocytes (p < 0.0001, z-score > 2). Survivalanalysis showed that resistin overexpression was associated with improved DFS.CONCLUSIONS: Higher circulating resistin correlated with node-negative patientsand longer DFS independent of BMI and ER status in women with EOBC.Overexpression of serum resistin in EOBC may be a surrogate indicator of improvedprognosis.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0938-6 PMCID: PMC5863447PMID: 29566726
