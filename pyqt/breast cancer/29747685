To extend this approach to breast cancer, we generated CAR T cells directed against mucin1 (MUC1), an aberrantly glycosylated neoantigenthat is overexpressed by malignant cells and whose expression has been correlatedwith poor prognosis. Furthermore, to protect our tumor-targeted cells from theelevated levels of immune-inhibitory cytokines present in the tumor milieu, weco-expressed an inverted cytokine receptor linking the IL4 receptor exodomainwith the IL7 receptor endodomain (4/7ICR) in order to transform the suppressiveIL4 signal into one that would enhance the anti-tumor effects of our CAR T cells at the tumor site.METHODS: First (1G - CD3ζ) and second generation (2G - 41BB.CD3ζ) MUC1-specificCARs were constructed using the HMFG2 scFv. Following retroviral transductiontransgenic expression of the CAR±ICR was assessed by flow cytometry. In vitroCAR/ICR T cell function was measured by assessing cell proliferation and short-and long-term cytotoxic activity using MUC1+ MDA MB 468 cells as targets. In vivoanti-tumor activity was assessed using IL4-producing MDA MB 468 tumor-bearingmice using calipers to assess tumor volume and bioluminescence imaging to track Tcells.RESULTS: In the IL4-rich tumor milieu, 1G CAR.MUC1 T cells failed to expand orkill MUC1+ tumors and while co-expression of the 4/7ICR promoted T cellexpansion, in the absence of co-stimulatory signals the outgrowing cellsexhibited an exhausted phenotype characterized by PD-1 and TIM3 upregulation and failed to control tumor growth. However, by co-expressing 2G CAR.MUC1 (signal 1 -activation + signal 2 - co-stimulation) and 4/7ICR (signal 3 - cytokine),transgenic T cells selectively expanded at the tumor site and produced potent anddurable tumor control in vitro and in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of targeting breast cancer using transgenic T cells equipped to thrive in the suppressive tumor milieu andhighlight the importance of providing transgenic T cells with signals thatrecapitulate physiologic TCR signaling - [activation (signal 1), co-stimulation(signal 2) and cytokine support (signal 3)] - to promote in vivo persistence and memory formation.DOI: 10.1186/s40425-018-0347-5 PMCID: PMC5944113PMID: 29747685
