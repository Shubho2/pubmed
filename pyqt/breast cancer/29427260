Assays were conducted for five cases per decade who had available tumor blocks andpathology reports.RESULTS: As compared to the tumors from the 1970s to 2000s, the older tumorsdating back to the 1950s and 1960s were much more likely to (1) fail qualitycontrol, and (2) have fewer CNV events (average 23 and 31 vs. 58 to 69), fewerCNV genes (average 5.1 and 3.7k vs. 8.1 to 10.3k), shorter CNV length (average2,440 and 3,300k vs. 5,740 to 9,280k), fewer high frequency Del genes (37 and 25%vs. 54 to 76%), and fewer high frequency high_Amp genes (20% vs. 56 to 73%). Onaverage, assay interpretation took an extra 60 min/specimen for cases from the1960s versus 20 min/specimen for the most recent tumors.CONCLUSIONS: Assays conducted in the mid-2010s for CNVs may be feasible for FFPE tumor specimens dating back to the 1980s, but less feasible for older specimens.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1006-3 PMCID: PMC5835216 [Available on 2019-03-01]PMID: 29427260
