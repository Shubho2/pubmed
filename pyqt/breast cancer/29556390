In the current study, the cases of two patients who were diagnosed with SqCCoriginated from skin and the breast were discussed. A fine-needle aspirationbiopsy confirmed the presence of atypical squamous cells. In both cases, themicroscopic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a malignant neoplasmdifferentiated into SqCC characterized by keratinizing cancer cells with abundanteosiphilic cytoplasm with large, hyperchromatic vesicular nuclei.Immunohistochemical studies showed negative for progesterone and estrogenreceptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Moreover, negativeexpression of cytokeratin 7 and 20 was confirmed. The diagnosis of the bothtumors was established based on the detailed analysis of clinical, macroscopical and microscopical information. SqCC localized in the breast is a great diagnosticchallenge in pathomorphology and more attention should be paid for analysis ofsuch lesions in daily practice.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2018.1581 PMCID: PMC5844120PMID: 29556390
