Although ERɑ-positive breast cancer could be effective treated by endocrine therapy, the endocrineresistance is still an urgent clinical problem. Thus, further understanding ofthe underlying mechanisms ERɑ signalling is critical in dealing with endocrineresistance in breast cancer patients. MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines areused to carry out the molecular biological experiments. Western blot is used toassess the relative protein level of ERɑ, RNF168 and actin. Real-time PCR is usedthe measure the relative ERɑ-related gene mRNA level. Luciferase assay is used tomeasure the relative ERɑ signalling activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation isused to measure the RNF168 binding affinity to ERɑ promoter regions. WST assayand flow cytometry are used to measure the cell proliferation capacity. We useStudent's t test and one-way ANOVA test for statistical data analysis. Here, wereport an important role in ERɑ-positive breast cancer cells for RNF168 proteinin supporting cell proliferation by driving the transcription of ERɑ. RNF168 ishighly expressed in breast cancer samples, compared with normal breast tissue. Inpatients with breast cancer, RNF168 expression level is correlated with poorendocrine treatment outcome. Depletion of RNF168 causes decreased cellproliferation in MCF-7 and T47D cells. Besides, depletion RNF168 reduced mRNAlevel of ERɑ and its target genes, such as PS2 and GREB1. Chromatinimmunoprecipitation revealed that ERɑ transcription is associated with RNF168recruitment to ERɑ promoter region, suggesting that transcriptional regulation isone mechanism by which RNF168 regulates ERɑ mRNA level and ERɑ signalling inbreast cancer cells. RNF168 is required for ERɑ-positive breast cancer cellproliferation and facilitate ERɑ signalling activity possibly through promotingtranscription of ERɑ.© 2018 The Authors.
