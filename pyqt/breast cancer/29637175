Orthogonal projections to latent structure discriminant analyses was used to model class differences andidentify metabolites contributing to the differences between groups.Additionally, spectra were correlated with birth weight, gestational age andweight z score at 2 weeks of age.Results: Of the original number of 926 trial participants, urine samples wereavailable from 197 (21%) healthy young adults (42% men) born preterm (mean30.7±2.8 weeks) and randomised to BBM (n=55; 28 men), TF (n=48; 14 men) and PTF(n=93; 40 men). We found no significant differences in urinary spectra betweendietary groups including when stratified by sex. Correlation analysis revealed a weak association between metabolic profile and gestational age that was lost oncontrolling for ethanol excretion.Conclusions: We found no evidence that dietary exposures in the neonatal periodinfluence the metabolic phenotype in young adult life.DOI: 10.1136/bmjpo-2017-000192 PMCID: PMC5862206PMID: 29637175
