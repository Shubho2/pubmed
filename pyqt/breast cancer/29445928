Epub 2018 Feb 14.Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab, lapatinib, and paclitaxel neoadjuvanttreatment with or without prolonged exposure to anti-HER2 therapy, and with orwithout hormone therapy for HER2-positive primary breast cancer: a randomised,five-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II trial.Masuda N(1), Toi M(2), Yamamoto N(3), Iwata H(4), Kuroi K(5), Bando H(6), Ohtani S(7), Takano T(8), Inoue K(9), Yanagita Y(10), Kasai H(11), Morita S(12), SakuraiT(13), Ohno S(14).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Breast Oncology, NHO Osaka National Hospital, Osaka,Japan.(2)Department of Surgery (Breast Surgery), Kyoto University Graduate School ofMedicine, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.toi@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.(3)Division of Breast Surgery, Chiba Cancer Center, Chiba, Japan.(4)Department of Breast Oncology, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.(5)Department of Breast Surgery, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and InfectiousDiseases Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.(6)Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba,Ibaraki, Japan.(7)Department of Breast Surgery, Hiroshima City Hiroshima Citizens Hospital,Hiroshima, Japan.(8)Department of Medical Oncology, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.(9)Division of Breast Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama, Japan.(10)Department of Breast Oncology, Gunma Prefectural Cancer Center, Gunma, Japan.(11)Institute for Advancement of Clinical and Translational Science, KyotoUniversity Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.(12)Department of Biomedical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Kyoto UniversityGraduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.(13)Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.(14)Clinical Research Institute, NHO Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.BACKGROUND: Dual blockade of HER2 promises increased pathological completeresponse (pCR) rate compared with single blockade in the presence of chemotherapyfor HER2-positive (+) primary breast cancer. Many questions remain regardingoptimal duration of treatment and combination impact of endocrine therapy forluminal HER2 disease.METHODS: We designed a randomised phase II, five-arm study to evaluate theefficacy and safety of lapatinib and trastuzumab (6 weeks) followed by lapatinib and trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel (12 weeks) with/without prolongation ofanti-HER2 therapy prior to chemotherapy (18 vs. 6 weeks), and with/withoutendocrine therapy in patients with HER2+ and/or oestrogen receptor (ER)+ disease.The primary endpoint was comprehensive pCR (CpCR) rate. Among the secondaryendpoints, pCR (yT0-isyN0) rate, safety, and clinical response were evaluated.RESULTS: In total, 215 patients were enrolled; 212 were included in the fullanalysis set (median age 53.0 years; tumour size = T2, 65%; and tumourspread = N0, 55%). CpCR was achieved in 101 (47.9%) patients and wassignificantly higher in ER- patients than in ER+ patients (ER- 63.0%, ER+ 36.1%; P = 0.0034). pCR with pN0 was achieved in 42.2% of patients (ER- 57.6%, ER+30.3%). No significant difference was observed in pCR rate between prolongedexposure groups and standard groups. Better clinical response outcomes wereobtained in the prolongation phase of the anti-HER2 therapy. No surplus wasdetected in pCR rate by adding endocrine treatment. No major safety concern wasrecognised by prolonging the anti-HER2 treatment or adding endocrine therapy.CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the therapeutic impact of lapatinib,trastuzumab, and paclitaxel therapy for each ER- and ER+ subgroup of HER2+patients. Development of further strategies and tools is required, particularlyfor luminal HER2 disease.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0839-7 PMCID: PMC5996004PMID: 29445928
