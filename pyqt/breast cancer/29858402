Participants were asked the risk of death that they were willing to take in order to avoid thehealth scenario using the standard gamble utility method. This process wasrepeated for all 11 health scenarios. Formal decision analysis for the preferred individual decision was then estimated for each participant.PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: The preferred diagnostic strategy was either watchfulwaiting or referral to a breast clinic. Sensitivity analysis was used to examine how each varied according to changes in the probabilities of the healthscenarios.RESULTS: A total of 35 participants completed the interviews, with a median age41 years (IQR 35-47 years). The majority of the study sample was employed (n=32, 91.4%), with a third-level (university) education (n=32, 91.4%) and withknowledge of someone with breast cancer (n=30, 85.7%). When individualpreferences were accounted for, 25 (71.4%) patients preferred watchful waiting toreferral for triple assessment as their preferred initial diagnostic strategy.Sensitivity analysis shows that referral for triple assessment becomes thedominant strategy at the upper probability estimate (18%) of breast cancer in thecommunity.CONCLUSIONS: Watchful waiting is an acceptable strategy for most women whopresent to their general practitioner (GP) with breast symptoms. These findingssuggest that current referral guidelines should take more explicit account ofwomen's preferences in relation to their GPs initial management strategy.Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
