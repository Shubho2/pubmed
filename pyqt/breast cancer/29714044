Our aim was to develop a betterunderstanding of women with metastatic breast cancer's decision-makingpreferences overtime and relative to specific types of decisions.METHODS: Convergent, parallel mixed-methods study. Participants completed theControl Preferences Scale (CPS) and a semi-structured interview ofdecision-making experiences at enrollment (T1; n = 22) and when facing a decisionor 3 months later (T2; n = 19). We categorized women's decision-making experiencedescriptions into one of the CPS decisional styles and compared them to their CPSresponse. We constructed an analytic grid that aligned the interview-determinedtreatment and ACP decisional preferences with the CPS categories at T1 and T2 andcalculated Cohen's kappa coefficient and congruence percentages.RESULTS: Participants (n = 22) were White (100%), averaged 62 years, married(54%), retired (45%), and had a bachelor's degree (45%). Congruence between CPSresponse and interview-determined treatment preferences at T1 was 32%(kappa = 0.083) and 33% (kappa = 0.120) at T2. Congruence between CPS surveyresponse and interview-determined ACP preferences at T1 was 22.7% (kappa =0.092) at T1 and 11% (kappa = 0.011) at T2.CONCLUSIONS: Although women selected a "shared" treatment decision-making styleusing the CPS validated tool, when interviewed their descriptions generallyreflected a passive process in which they followed the oncologists' treatmentsuggestions. Future research should explore whether the incongruence betweenstated and actual decision-making style is a function of misinterpreting the CPS choices or a true inconsistency that could lead to adverse consequences such asdecisional regret.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/pon.4747 PMID: 29714044
