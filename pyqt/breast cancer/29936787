Email: drmalekzadeh.m@gmail.comBackground: Axillary lymph node metastasis is the most important predictivefactor for recurrence risk and survival in patients with invasive breastcarcinoma. The aim of this study was to determine factors associated withmetastatic involvement of axillary lymph nodes in Iranian women with early breastcancer. Methods: This article reports a retrospective study of 774 patients with T1-T2 breast cancer who underwent resection of the primary tumor and axillarystaging by SLNB and/or ALND between 2005 and 2015 at our institution. Results: Ofthe 774 patients included in this study, 35.5% (275 cases) had axillary lymphnode involvement at the time of diagnosis. Factors associated with nodalinvolvement in univariate analyses were tumor size, lymphovascular invasion(LVI), tumor grade, ER/PR status and HER2 expression. All factors identified withunivariate analyses were entered into a multivariate logistic regression modeland tumor size (OR= 3.01, CI 2.01–4.49, P <0.001), ER/PR positivity (OR = 1.74,CI 1.1.16–2.62, P = 0.007) and presence of LVI (OR = 3.3.8, CI 2.31–4.95, P<0.001) remained as independent predictors of axillary lymph node involvement.Conclusions: In conclusion, the results of this study suggests that positivehormonal receptor status, LVI and tumor size are predictive factors for ALNM inIranian women with early breast cancer.Creative Commons Attribution LicenseDOI: 10.22034/APJCP.2018.19.6.1617 PMID: 29936787
