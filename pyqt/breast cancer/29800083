[Epub ahead of print]Outcomes of Acellular Dermal Matrix for Immediate Tissue Expander Reconstruction with Radiotherapy: A Retrospective Cohort Study.Craig ES(1), Clemens MW(1), Koshy JC(1), Wren J(1), Hong Z(1), Butler C(1),Garvey P(1), Selber J(1), Kronowitz S(1).Author information: (1)Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, The University of Texas MDAnderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Background: Despite increasing literature support for the use of acellular dermalmatrix (ADM) in expander-based breast reconstruction, the effect of ADM onclinical outcomes in the presence of post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) hasnot been well described.Objectives: To analyze the impact ADM plays on clinical outcomes on immediatetissue expander (ITE) reconstruction undergoing PMRT.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent ITE breastreconstruction from 2004 to 2014 at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Patients werecategorized into four cohorts: ADM, ADM with PMRT, non-ADM, and non-ADM withPMRT. Outcomes and complications were compared between cohorts.Results: Over ten years, 957 patients underwent ITE reconstruction (683 non-ADM, 113 non-ADM with PMRT, 486 ADM, and 88 ADM with PMRT) with 1,370 reconstructions.Overall complication rates for the ADM and non-ADM cohorts were 39.0 and 16.7%,respectively (p <0.001). Within both cohorts, mastectomy skin flap necrosis(MSFN) was the most common complication, followed by infection. ADM use wasassociated with a significantly higher rate of infections and seromas in bothradiated and non-radiated groups; however, when comparing radiated cohorts, theincidence of explantation was significantly lower with the use of ADM.Conclusions: The decision to use ADM for expander-based breast reconstructionshould be performed with caution, given higher overall rates of complications,including infections and seromas. There may, however, be a role for ADM in cases requiring PMRT, as the overall incidence of implant failure is lower than non-ADMcases.DOI: 10.1093/asj/sjy127 PMID: 29800083
