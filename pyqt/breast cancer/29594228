Per Martina Franca,74100 Taranto, Italy.Background and purpose: To investigate the hypothesis on low-dose bath exposurerelated to radiation-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) in adjuvant breastvolumetric modulated arch therapy (VMAT).Methods and materials: A total of 106 consecutive breast cancer patients (pts)treated with adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) with VMAT from January 2013 to May 2016were evaluated retrospectively. For each pt, a planning CT was reimported and thecoeliac plexus and gastroesophageal junction with gastric mouth (GEJCPs) werecontoured as a new organ at risk (OAR) in the upper abdominal area. RINV wasassociated with Dmax and Dmean to GEJCPs. Univariate analysis with χ2, t-test,and Pearson's covariance was used for statistical analysis.Results: Of 106 pts, 64% complained of acute RINV according to the CommonTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. RINV was related toDmax > 10 Gy and Dmean > 3 Gy to GEJCPs (P < 0.005). The radiation breast sideand planning target volume (PTV) correlated with RINV.Conclusions: RINV in VMAT breast radiotherapy could be a new emerging acute side effect due to a low dose bath to upper abdominal structures such as the GEJCPs. ADmax < 10 Gy and Dmean < 3 Gy to GEJCPs should be constrained in VMAT planning tominimize RINV risk in breast radiotherapy.DOI: 10.1016/j.ctro.2017.09.009 PMCID: PMC5862677PMID: 29594228
