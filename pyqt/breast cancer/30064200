[Epub ahead of print]Prognostic Role and Clinical Association of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte,Programmed Death Ligand-1 Expression with Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio in Locally Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.Lee J(1)(2), Kim DM(3), Lee A(2)(3).Author information: (1)Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College ofMedicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.(2)Cancer Research Institute, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.(3)Department of Hospital Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic Universityof Korea, Seoul, Korea.Purpose: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)expression and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is associated toimmunogenicity and prognosis of breast cancer. We analyzed baseline NLR, changes of NLR, TIL, and PD-L1 during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and their clinicalimplication in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).Materials and Methods: Between January 2008 to December 2015, 358 TNBC patientswere analyzed. Baseline NLR, 50 paired NLR (initial diagnosis, after completionof NAC) and 34 paired tissues (initial diagnosis, surgical specimen aftercompletion of NAC) were collected. Changes of TIL, CD4, CD8, forkhead box P3(FOXP3), and PD-L1 expression were assessed with immunohistochemical stain.Results: Low NLR (≤3.16) was associated to superior survival (overall survival;41.83 months vs. 36.5 months, p=0.002; disease-free survival [DFS] 37.85 monthsvs. 32.14 months, p=0.032). Modest NLR change after NAC (-30%<NLR change<100%)showed prolonged DFS (38.37 months vs. 22.37 months, p=0.015). During NAC,negative or negative conversion of tumor PD-L1 expression was associated to poor DFS (34.77 months vs. 16.03 months, p=0.037), and same or increased TIL showedtrends for superior DFS, but without statistical significance. Positive tumorPD-L1 expression (H-score ≥5) in baseline or post-NAC tissue was associated tosuperior DFS (57.6 months vs. 12.5 months, p=0.001 and 53.3 months vs. 18.9months, p=0.04). Positive stromal PD-L1 expression in baseline was alsoassociated to superior DFS (50.2 months vs. 20.4 months, p=0.002).Conclusion: In locally advanced TNBC, baseline NLR, changes of NLR during NAC wasassociated to survival. Baseline PD-L1 expression and changes of PD-L1 expressionin tumor tissue during NAC also showed association to prognosis.DOI: 10.4143/crt.2018.270 PMID: 30064200
