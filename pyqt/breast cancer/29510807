The aimof this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of an outpatient breastcancer programme in patients referred to a large breast cancer unit.METHODS: After an introduction period involving 554 consecutive patients, allpatients operated from 1 November 2015 to 30 June 2016 (a total 483 patients)were treated with multimodal oral analgesia, preoperative high-doseglucocorticoids and no routine use of drains. Planned inpatient surgery included patients with mastectomy > 70 years, < 8 h in post-operative observation and < 2 h of observation after mobilisation.RESULTS: Of the 382 patients who were planned for outpatient surgery (79%), 90%received surgery in an outpatient setup. Among the 101 patients (21%) who wereplanned for inpatient surgery, 17% returned home on the day of surgery.Consequently, the overall outpatient rate was 72% and the overall mean length of stay was 0.3 days, ranging from 0.1 days for breast-conserving surgery to 0.8days for mastectomy. About 2% were readmitted within < 30 days, mostly due towound problems. Conclusion: Outpatient breast cancer surgery is feasible and safein most patients in a socialised healthcare system.FUNDING: none.TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant. .Articles published in the Danish Medical Journal are “open access”.
