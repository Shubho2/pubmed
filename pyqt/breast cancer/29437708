However, the heterogeneity of TAM presents a major challenge toidentify clinically relevant markers for protumor TAM. Here, we report thatexpression of adipocyte/macrophage fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) in TAMpromotes breast cancer progression. Although upregulation of A-FABP was inverselyassociated with breast cancer survival, deficiency of A-FABP significantlyreduced mammary tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, the protumor effect of A-FABP was mediated by TAM, in particular, in a subset of TAM with aCD11b+F4/80+MHCII-Ly6C- phenotype. A-FABP expression in TAM facilitated protumor IL6/STAT3 signaling through regulation of the NFκB/miR-29b pathway. Collectively,our results suggest A-FABP as a new functional marker for protumorTAM.Significance: These findings identify A-FABP as a functional marker forprotumor macrophages, thus offering a new target for tumor immunotherapy.
