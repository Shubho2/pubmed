The purpose of this study is toexamine factors influencing trust in the healthcare system and providers among KAwomen.METHODS: Data were collected in 196 KA women examining the effects of perceiveddiscrimination and trust on breast cancer screening in the Chicago metropolitanarea. Path analysis was used to identify factors influencing trust in thehealthcare system and providers.RESULTS: Acculturation was positively related to trust in healthcare providers(β = .15, p =. 002), and discrimination in the healthcare system was inverselyrelated to trust in healthcare providers (β = -.60, p <. 001). Length of stay in the US was inversely related to distrust in the healthcare system (β = -.14, p <.001), and discrimination in healthcare was positively related to distrust in the healthcare system (β = .60, p <. 001). Trust in healthcare providers and distrustin the healthcare system were moderately correlated (r = .51, p < .001).CONCLUSION: Higher levels of acculturation and lower levels of perceiveddiscrimination were identified as predictors of higher levels of trust inhealthcare providers. A shorter stay in the US and higher levels ofdiscrimination were identified as predictors of higher levels of distrust in the healthcare system. Perceived discrimination is a target for interventions toenhance trust in the healthcare system, and therefore reduce healthcaredisparities in KAs.DOI: 10.1186/s12905-018-0609-x PMCID: PMC6013887PMID: 29929508
