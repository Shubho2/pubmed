Electronic address:nanditamishra@am.amrita.edu.An α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compound of ginger, 6-Shogaol (6S), inducedextensive cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death in breast cancer cell(MDA-MB-231) and non-small lung cancer (A549) cells. In the presence ofautophagic inhibitors the cells continued to exhibit cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death clearly distinguishing it from the classic autophagic process. 6Sinduced death did not exhibit the characteristic apoptotic features like caspase cleavage, phosphatidyl serine exposure and DNA fragmentation. Theimmunofluorescence with the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) resident protein,calreticulin indicated that the vacuoles were of ER origin, typical ofparaptosis. This was supported by the increase in level of microtubule associatedprotein light chain 3B (LC3 I and LC3 II) and polyubiquitin binding protein, p62.The level of ER stress markers like polyubiquitinated proteins, Bip and CHOP alsoconsistently increased. We have found that 6S inhibits the 26S proteasome. Theproteasomal inhibitory activity was elucidated by a) molecular docking of 6S ontothe active site of β5 subunit and b) reduced fluorescence by the fluorogenicsubstrate of the chymotrypsin-like subunit. In conclusion these studiesdemonstrate for the first time that proteasomal inhibition by 6S induces celldeath via paraptosis. So 6-shogaol may act as a template for anti-cancer leaddiscovery against the apoptosis resistant cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
