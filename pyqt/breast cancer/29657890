This study sought to determine the incidence and risk factors associated with PF following single fraction sSRS.Materials/methods: An IRB-approved database was compiled to include patients who underwent sSRS. Patient and disease characteristics as well as treatment anddosimetric details were collected retrospectively. Pain relief post-sSRS wasprospectively collected using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). These factors were correlated to the development of PF (defined as an increase in pain within 7 daysof treatment which resolved with steroids). Survival was calculated usingKaplan-Meier analysis and logistic regression was utilized to evaluate theassociation between the clinical and treatment factors and occurrence of PF.Results: A total of 348 patients with 507 treatments were included. Median ageand prescription dose were 59 years and 15 Gy (range: 7-18), respectively, and62% of patients were male. Renal cell carcinoma (24%), lung cancer (14%), andbreast cancer (11%) were the most common histologies, and 74% had epiduraldisease and 43% had thecal sac compression. The most common location ofmetastases was in the cervical/thoracic spine (59%), followed by lumbar spine(32%), and sacral spine (9%). Most common reason for treatment was pain (73%),followed by pain and neurological deficit (13%), asymptomatic disease (10%), and neurologic deficit only (3%). Median time to pain relief was 1.8 months. Medianoverall survival, time to radiographic failure, and time to pain progression were13.6 months, 26.5 months, and 56.6 months, respectively. Only 14.4% of treatmentsresulted in the development of PF. Univariate analysis showed that higherKarnofsky performance score (KPS) (OR=1.03, p=0.03), female gender (OR=1.80,p=0.02), higher prescription dose (OR=1.30, p=0.008), and tumor location ofcervical/thoracic spine vs lumbar spine (OR=1.81, p=0.047) were predictors forthe development of PF. On multivariate analysis, higher consult KPS (OR=1.03,p=0.04), female gender (OR=1.93, p=0.01), higher prescription dose (OR=1.27,p=0.02), and tumor location of cervical/thoracic spine vs lumbar spine (OR=1.81, p=0.05) remained predictors of PF. No other dosimetric parameters were associatedwith the development of PF.Conclusion: PF is an infrequent complication of sSRS. Predictors for thedevelopment of PF include higher consult KPS, female gender, higher prescription dose, and cervical/thoracic tumor location. Dose to the spinal cord was not apredictor of PF. Since a minority (14.4%) of treatments result in PF, we do notroutinely utilize prophylactic steroid treatment; however, prophylactic steroids may be considered in female patients with cervical/thoracic metastases receiving higher dose sSRS.PMCID: PMC5893450PMID: 29657890
