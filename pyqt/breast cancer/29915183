The aims of this study were to examine awareness of andattitudes toward genetic testing among the general public (public), cancerpatients (patients), and health-care professionals (clinicians and researchers)in Korea. The present survey was conducted from November 2016 to February 2017.The public and patients were surveyed via face-to-face interviews conducted bytrained interviewers. Health-care professionals were surveyed viaself-administered questionnaires. In total, 1500 individuals from the generalpublic, 1500 cancer patients, 113 clinicians, and 413 researchers were surveyed. Most respondents from the public and patients had previously heard about genetic testing (public, 89.4%; patients, 92.7%, p < 0.01). Differences in attitudestoward genetic testing among the public, patients, and professionals were noted, although most respondents in the present study were aware of genetic testing.Most of the cancer patients tended to overestimate the potential benefit ofgenetic testing, whereas clinicians expressed concerns for genetic testing.Providing correct information to people who are scheduled to undergo or ordergenetic testing could help in making an informed decision thereon.DOI: 10.1038/s41431-018-0191-6 PMID: 29915183
