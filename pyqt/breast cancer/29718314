The primary endpoint was recurrence-free interval (RFI), including locoregional recurrence, distantrecurrence, and breast cancer death. Noninferiority required the two-sided 90%confidence interval of the RFI hazard ratio (HR) for no-RT vs RT to be entirelybelow 1.7. Model inputs included published data. The trial was simulated 1000times, and results were summarized as percent concluding noninferiority and mean (standard deviation) of hazard ratios for Model GE and Model M, respectively.Results: Noninferiority was demonstrated in 18.0% and 3.7% for the two models.The respective means (SD) of the RFI hazard ratios were 1.8 (0.7) and 2.4 (0.9); most were locoregional recurrences. The mean five-year RFI rates for no-RT vs RT (SD) were 92.7% (2.9%) vs 95.5% (2.2%) and 88.4% (2.0%) vs 94.5% (1.6%). Bothmodels showed little or no difference in breast cancer-specific or overallsurvival. Alternative definitions of low risk based on combinations of age andgrade produced similar results.Conclusions: The proposed trial was unlikely to show noninferiority of omittingradiotherapy even using alternative definitions of low-risk, as the endpointincluded local recurrence. Future trials regarding radiotherapy should addressabsolute reduction in recurrence and impact of type of recurrence on the patient.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy059 PMID: 29718314
