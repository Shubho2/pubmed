Computed tomography (CT) revealed widespreadmetastatic disease involving the lungs, liver, pancreas, and breast. SerumÎ²-human chorionic gonadotropin was markedly raised. Over 72 h, she deterioratedand was started on high-flow nasal cannula to facilitate discussions and forcomfort. Histology from a breast biopsy suggested a choriocarcinoma, and she was commenced on etoposide and cisplatin. Unfortunately she continued to deteriorate and died on day 11 of admission. Molecular genotyping received post-mortemconfirmed non-gestational choriocarcinomatous differentiation within a high-gradetumour.Discussion: NGCC carries a worse prognosis compared with gestationalchoriocarcinoma and is historically less chemosensitive. However, differentiationbetween these two diagnoses is challenging due to a lack of immuno-histochemical differences. The NGCC in this case was likely to have originated in the lung due to a 12-cm mass in the lingula, and extensive emphysema on CT. Primary pulmonary choriocarcinoma has a rapidly fatal course in the majority of patients.Conclusion: This is the only case to our knowledge of NGCC presenting inextremis, where an accurate diagnosis was not achieved pre-mortem. This alsodemonstrates the merit of non-invasive ventilation within palliation tofacilitate communication and comfort.DOI: 10.1159/000486639 PMCID: PMC5903105PMID: 29681814
