However, its relationships with lncRNAs and their functional pathway analysis in breast tumorigenesis are less intensively studied.METHODS: The expression data from TCGA database and multiple bioinformaticsresources were used to check the expression levels, survival curves, interactionsand functional illustrations of miR-20a and its related lncRNAs (XIST, H19 andMALAT1) in breast cancer patients. The luciferase reporter assays and Pearson'scorrelation analyses were utilized to verify the direct regulatory relationshipbetween miR-20a and three lncRNAs (XIST, H19 and MALAT1). In vitro cellproliferation, migration and invasion assays, were performed to check thebiological effects of miR-20a and XIST in different breast cancer cell lines. Thereceiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were done for evaluatingdiagnostic values of serum miR-20a and XIST in breast cancer patients.RESULTS: The miR-20a expression was significantly up-regulated in both breastcancer samples and serum samples, and correlated with poor survival rate inbreast cancer patients. LncRNAs (XIST, H19 and MALAT1) directly bound tohsa-miR-20a and were negatively correlated with hsa-miR-20a expression in breast cancer patient samples. For functional illustrations and downstream signalingpathways analysis, XIST, H19 and MALAT1 mainly shared their regulatory functions in cell motility and interleukin signaling in breast cancer progression.Additionally, over-expression of miR-20a and inhibition of XIST promoted breastcancer cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro, and serum miR-20a and XISTserved as potential diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer with the area underROC curve (AUC) of 0.87 (95% CI = 0.78 to 0.97), and 0.78 (95% CI = 0.67 to 0.89)respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings provide us novel insights and avenuesfor utilizing miR-20a and its related lncRNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers and promising therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment.Copyright © 2018.
