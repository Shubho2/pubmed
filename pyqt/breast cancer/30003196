Epub 2018Jun 28.Comparing Survival After Recurrent vs De Novo Stage IV Advanced Breast, Lung, andColorectal Cancer.Hassett MJ(1)(2), Uno H(1)(2), Cronin AM(1), Carroll NM(3), Hornbrook MC(4),Ritzwoller DP(3).Author information: (1)Division of Population Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.(2)Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.(3)Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Institute for Health Research, Denver, CO.(4)Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, Portland, OR.The treatments provided to and survival of patients with recurrent vs de novostage IV advanced breast, lung, and colorectal cancer may differ but have notbeen well studied. Using population-based data from the Cancer Research Networkfor 4510 patients with advanced breast, lung, or colorectal cancer, we matchedrecurrent/de novo patients on demographic factors. We found longer survival forrecurrent vs de novo lung cancer (182 matched pairs); no significant differencefor colorectal cancer (332 matched pairs); and shorter survival for recurrent vs de novo breast cancer (219 matched pairs). Compared with recurrent cases,chemotherapy use and radiation therapy use were more common among de novo cases. Differences in treatment and survival between recurrent and de novo advancedcancer patients could inform prognostic estimates and clinical trial design.DOI: 10.1093/jncics/pky024 PMCID: PMC6024888PMID: 30003196
