For comparative purposes, the analysiswas also carried out in the less-metastatic breast MCF-7 cancer cells. Undernormoxia, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) was significantly higher (2-times)in MDA-MB-468 than in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, whereas their glycolytic fluxes andOxPhos and glycolytic protein contents were all similar. TN cancer cell linesmainly depended on OxPhos (62-75%), whereas MCF-7 cells equally depended on both pathways for ATP supply. Hypoxia for 24 h promoted a significant increase (>20times) in the glycolytic transcriptional master factor HIF1-α in its targetproteins GLUT-1, HKI and II, and LDH-A (2-4 times) as well as in the glycolyticflux (1.3-2 times) vs normoxia in MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7. On thecontrary, hypoxia decreased (15-60%) the contents of COXIV, 2OGDH, ND1, and ATPsynthase as well as the OxPhos flux (50-75%), correlating with a high mitophagylevel in the three cell lines. Under hypoxia, the three cancer cell lines mainly depended on glycolysis (70-80%). Anti-mitochondrial drugs (oligomycin, casiopeinaII-gly, and methoxy-TEA) and celecoxib, at doses used to block OxPhos,significantly decreased TN cancer cell proliferation (IC50 = 2-20 μM), migration capacity (10-90%), and invasiveness (25-65%). The present data support the use ofmitochondrially targeted inhibitors for the treatment of TN breast carcinoma.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00015 PMID: 29746779
