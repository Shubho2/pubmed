GSLs play essential roles inmaintenance of plasma membrane stability, in regulation of numerous cellularprocesses (including adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis, and recognition), and inmodulation of signal transduction pathways. GSLs have traditionally beenclassified as ganglio-series, lacto-series, or globo-series on the basis of theirdiverse types of oligosaccharide chains. Structures and functions of specificGSLs are also determined by their oligosaccharide chains. Different cells andtissues show differential expression of GSLs, and changes in structures of GSLglycan moieties occur during development of numerous types of human cancer.Association of GSLs and/or related enzymes with initiation and progression ofcancer has been documented in 100s of studies, and many such GSLs are usefulmarkers or targets for cancer diagnosis or therapy. In this review, we summarize (i) recent studies on aberrant expression and distribution of GSLs in commonhuman cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, melanoma, prostate, ovarian, leukemia,renal, bladder, gastric); (ii) biological functions of specific GSLs in thesecancers.DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2018.00466 PMCID: PMC5943571PMID: 29773994
