It begins by outlining the Humanization ofHealthcare Framework ( Todres et al, 2009 ), which is a values-based context thatcan be used to underpin daily care. Generic applications for each of thedimensions of the framework are suggested. This framework is then used tocontextualise my experience of receiving my diagnosis and the ensuingchemotherapy. Using examples from my personal narrative, I make somerecommendations for 'small actions' that can contribute to more humanised andperson-centred care. I also hope that this narrative prompts reflection by thereader and so improves the quality of care given to others.DOI: 10.12968/bjon.2018.27.4.S18 PMID: 29457953
