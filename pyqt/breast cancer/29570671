Also, hypericin, a bioactive compound of SJW, has beenused as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy. In the present study, weinvestigate the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of SJW todemonstrate the chemo-preventive effect in human breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cellswere cultured with DMSO or various concentrations of SJW ethanol extract (SJWE). Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, the expression of proteins involved in cell growth and apoptosis, and caspase-3/7 activity were examined. SJWEdose-dependently suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells.Mechanistically, SJWE enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated proteinkinase (AMPK) and decreased the expression of p-mammalian target of rapamycin(p-mTOR) and p-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-bindingprotein 1 (4E-BP1). Also, SJWE inhibited the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and showed increases in the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax andBad with decreases in the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins including B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), and p-Bcl-2-associated death promoter (p-Bad). SJWE at 50 Î¼g/mL showed markedly enhanced caspase-7activation. Taken together, our results provide evidence that SJWE showsanti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects via inhibition of AMPK/mTOR andactivation of a mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, SJWE can be used as achemo-preventive agent without photo-activation.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19040966 PMCID: PMC5979501PMID: 29570671
