Therefore, new molecular targets andtreatments need to be developed to improve poor patient prognosis and survival.We have previously shown that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF-2K) ishighly expressed in TNBC cells, is associated with poor patient survival andprognosis, and promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In vivotargeting of eEF-2K significantly reduces the tumor growth of orthotopic TNBCxenograft mouse models, suggesting that eEF-2K may serve as a potential noveltherapeutic target.METHODS/RESULTS: In the current study, we identified thymoquinone (TQ), an activeingredient of Nigella sativa, as a potential safe and effective eEF-2K inhibitor in TNBC. We demonstrated for the first time that TQ inhibits the protein and mRNAexpression of eEF-2K, as well as the clinically relevant downstream targets,including Src/FAK and Akt, and induces the tumor suppressor miR-603, in response to NF-kB inhibition. This effect was associated with a significant decrease inthe proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells.Furthermore, systemic in vivo injection of TQ (20 and 100Â mg/kg) significantlyreduced the growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors and inhibited the eEF-2K expression in anorthotopic tumor model in mice.CONCLUSION: Our study provides first evidence that TQ treatment inhibits cellproliferation, migration/invasion, and tumor growth, in part through theinhibition of eEF-2K signaling in TNBC. Thus, our findings suggest that systemic TQ treatment may be used as a targeted therapeutic strategy for the inhibition ofeEF-2K in TNBC tumor growth and progression.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4847-2 PMID: 29971628
