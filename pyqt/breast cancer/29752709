[Epub ahead of print]Association between a pro plant-based dietary score and cancer risk in theprospective NutriNet-santé cohort.Kane-Diallo A(1)(2), Srour B(1), Sellem L(1), Deschasaux M(1), Latino-MartelP(1), Hercberg S(1)(2), Galan P(1), Fassier P(1), Guéraud F(3), Pierre FH(3),Kesse-Guyot E(1), Allès B(1), Touvier M(1).Author information: (1)Sorbonne Paris Cité Epidemiology and Statistics Research Center (CRESS),Inserm U1153, Inra U1125, Cnam, Paris 13 University, Nutritional EpidemiologyResearch Team (EREN), Bobigny, France.(2)Public Health Department, Avicenne Hospital, AP-HP, Bobigny, France.(3)Public Health Department, Toxalim (Research Centre in Food Toxicology),Université de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, INP-Purpan, UPS, Toulouse, France.Diverse plant products (e.g. fruits, vegetables, legumes) are associated withdecreased cancer risk at several locations while red and processed meat werefound to increase cancer risk. A pro plant-based dietary score reflecting therelative contribution of consumed plant vs animal products was developed, and wasassociated with lower overall mortality, type 2 diabetes and cardiovasculardisease risk, among omnivorous adults. For the first time, we investigated theprospective associations between this pro plant-based dietary score and cancerrisk. This study included 42,544 men and women of the French NutriNet-Santéprospective cohort (2009-2016) aged ≥45 years who completed at least three24-hr-dietary records during the first year of follow-up. The risk of developing cancer was compared across sex-specific tertiles of pro plant-based dietary scoreby multivariable Cox models. In total, 1,591 first primary incident cancer cases were diagnosed during follow-up, among which 487 breast, 243 prostate, 198digestive and 68 lung cancers. A higher pro plant-based dietary score wasassociated with decreased risks of overall (HRt3vs.t1 =0.85; 95% CI 0.76, 0.97;Ptrend =0.02), digestive (HRt3vs.t1 =0.68; 95% CI 0.47; 0.99; Ptrend  = 0.04) andlung (HRt3vs.t1 =0.47; 95% CI 0.25, 0.90; Ptrend =0.02) cancer, though nosubstantial associations were found for breast or prostate cancers. This largecohort study supports a beneficial role of higher intakes of plant-based productsalong with lower intakes of animal products, within a balanced omnivorous diet,regarding primary cancer prevention. These results are consistent withmechanistic evidence from experimental studies.© 2018 UICC.DOI: 10.1002/ijc.31593 PMID: 29752709
