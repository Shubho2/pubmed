Among others, senescent cells are able to transformtissue structures around them. Tumor cells, whose hallmark is their ability toproliferate indefinitely, are not free from the phenomenon. Here, we report aremarkable observation where senescent cells in a dense mono-layer of breastcancer colony act as aggregating centers for non-senescent cells in theirvicinity. Consequently, the senescent cells actively form localized 3Dcell-clusters in a confluent 2D tumor layer. The biophysical mechanismunderpinning the surprising phenomenon primarily involves mitotic cell-rounding, dynamic and differential cell attachments, and cellular chemotaxis. Byincorporating these few biophysical factors, we were able to recapitulate theexperimental observation via a cellular Potts Model.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-28963-0 PMCID: PMC6043561PMID: 30002435
