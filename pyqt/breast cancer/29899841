Triple negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of breast cancer, is characterized by elevatedglycolysis, while estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells relypredominantly on OXPHOS. BCL2 proteins control the process of mitochondrial outermembrane permeabilization during apoptosis, but also regulate cellularbioenergetics. Because BCL2 proteins are overexpressed in breast cancer andtargetable by selective antagonists, we here analysed the effect of BCL2 andBCL(X)L selective inhibitors, Venetoclax and WEHI-539, on mitochondrialbioenergetics and cell death. Employing single cell imaging using a FRET-basedmitochondrial ATP sensor, we found that MCF7 breast cancer cells supplied withmitochondrial substrates reduced their mitochondrial ATP production when treated with Venetoclax or WEHI-539 at concentrations that per se did not induce celldeath. Treatments with lower concentrations of both inhibitors also reduced thelength of the mitochondrial network and the dynamics, as evaluated byquantitative confocal microscopy. We next tested the hypothesis thatmitochondrial ATP production inhibition with BCL2 or BCL(X)L antagonists wassynthetically lethal when combined with glycolysis inhibition. Treatment with2-deoxy-D-glucose in combination with Venetoclax or WEHI-539 synergisticallyreduced the cellular bioenergetics of ER+ and TNBC breast cancer cells andabolished their clonogenic potential. Synthetic lethality was also observed when cultures were grown in 3D spheres. Our findings demonstrate that BCL2 antagonistsexert potent effects on cancer metabolism independent of cell death-inducingeffects, and demonstrate a synthetic lethality when these are applied incombination with glycolysis inhibitors.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25433 PMCID: PMC5995245PMID: 29899841
