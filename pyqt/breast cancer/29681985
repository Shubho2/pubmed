Hormonaltherapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have been used as treatment ofbreast cancer, for a very long time. Due to severe side effects and multidrugresistance, these treatment approaches become increasingly ineffective. However, adoption of complementary treatment approach can be a big solution for thissituation, as it is evident that compounds derived from natural source have agreat deal of anticancer activity. Natural compounds can fight againstaggressiveness of breast cancer, inhibit cancerous cell proliferation, andmodulate cancer related pathways. A large number of research works are nowfocusing on the natural and dietary compounds and trying to find out new and moreeffective treatment strategies for the breast cancer patients. In this review, wediscussed some significant natural chemical compounds with their mechanisms ofactions, which can be very effective against the breast cancer and can be morepotent by their proper modifications and further clinical research. Futureresearch focusing on the natural anti-breast-cancer agents can open a new horizonin breast cancer treatment, which will play a great role in enhancing thesurvival rate of breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1155/2018/8324696 PMCID: PMC5846366PMID: 29681985
