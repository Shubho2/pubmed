Electronic address:gzwangkun@126.com.INTRODUCTION: The prognostic value of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET)in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains controversial. A meta-analysis of the impact of MET in TNBCs was performed by searching published data.METHODS: PubMed and Embase databases were searched for eligible literature. Theprincipal outcome measures were hazard ratios (HRs) for recurrence-free survival or overall survival according to MET expression. Combined HRs were calculatedusing fixed- or random-effects models according to heterogeneity.RESULTS: Six studies involving 785 patients met our selection criteria. Themeta-analysis results showed that MET overexpression was associated with a1.29-fold increased risk of recurrence (combined HR 1.29; 95% confidenceinterval, 1.04-1.60; P = .020) in the TNBCs. Three studies provided the relatedoverall survival data (488 cases). The results showed that MET overexpression wasassociated with a 1.38-fold increased risk of mortality (HR, 1.38; 95% confidenceinterval, 1.08-1.76; P = .009).CONCLUSION: MET is an adverse prognostic marker for TNBCs. The results strengthenthe rationale for targeted therapy of TNBCs using MET inhibitors in futureclinical trials.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
