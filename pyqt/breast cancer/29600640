As a vitally importantfunctional membrane, it is widely found in various tissues and organs. The drugchanges the expressions and/or functions of the transport proteins, which willaffect the disposal process of substrate drugs corresponding to transporters invivo, and finally lead to the pharmacokinetic interactions. The efflux proteinstake part in the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs, andmainly consist of P-glycoprotein(P-gp), multidrug resistance associatedprotein(MRP) and breast cancer resistance protein(BCRP). The induction effect or inhibition effect of drugs on efflux protein plays a greatly significant role in the drug interaction produced by the compatibility of traditional Chinesemedicine, which may be one of the important mechanisms of the theory of sevenfeatures of compatibility. In this article, the effects of seven features ofcompatibility on the ABC efflux transporters were reviewed, in order to revealthe roles of efflux protein in the herb-pairs compatibility, and provide newideas for the mechanism and rationality of herb compatibility.Copyright© by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association.PMID: 29600640
