Epub 2018 Feb 10.Tumour Heterogeneity of Breast Cancer: From Morphology to Personalised Medicine.Aleskandarany MA(1), Vandenberghe ME, Marchiò C, Ellis IO, Sapino A, Rakha EA.Author information: (1)Department of Histopathology, University of Nottingham and NottinghamUniversity Hospitals NHS Trust, City Hospital, Nottingham, UK.Breast cancer (BC) displays striking clinical, morphological, and behaviouraldiversity within a single tumour and between tumours. Currently, mountingevidence indicates that the morphological heterogeneity of BC reflects anunderlying spectrum of genetic and epigenetic portraits that control BCbehaviour. Further understanding of BC heterogeneity will have an impact, notonly on the routine diagnostic practices but also on patients' managementdecisions. Phenomena like diagnostic inconsistencies and therapeutic resistance, both primary and acquired, could be attributed, at least in part, to tumourheterogeneity within the same cancer and between the primary disease andsubsequent recurrences. From a practical standpoint, and to minimise the impactof BC intratumoral heterogeneity, pragmatic approaches for adequate tumoursampling have been suggested in translational biomarker discovery and validation research studies and in the clinical setting. Here, we provide a brief overviewof BC heterogeneity, with an emphasis on the clinical consequences ofintratumoral heterogeneity.© 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.DOI: 10.1159/000477851 PMID: 29428954
