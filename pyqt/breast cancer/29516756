Lys and αTS were used as a biocompatible enzyme and ahydrophobic residue, respectively, for the preparation of nanocarriers in thisstudy. Compared with CUR-loaded cross-linked Lys (c-Lys/CUR) NA, Lys-αTS/CUR NAexhibited a smaller hydrodynamic size (213 nm mean diameter), a narrower sizedistribution, and a more spherical shape. Sustained drug release was observedfrom the Lys-αTS/CUR NA for five days at a normal physiological pH (pH 7.4). The developed Lys-αTS/CUR NA showed enhanced cellular accumulation, antiproliferativeeffects, and apoptotic efficacies in MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinomacells. According to the results of optical imaging test in the MDA-MB-231tumor-bearing mouse models, the Lys-αTS/CUR NA-injected group exhibited a moretumor-selective accumulation pattern, rather than being distributed in the normaltissues and organs. The observed tumor targetability of Lys-αTS/CUR was furtherstudied, which revealed improved in vivo anticancer activities (better inhibitionof tumor growth and induction of apoptosis in the tumor tissue) after anintravenous administration in the MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mouse models. Allthese results indicate that the newly developed enzyme-based nanocarrier, theLys-αTS NA, can be a promising candidate for the therapy of breast cancers.DOI: 10.1080/10717544.2018.1446476 PMID: 29516756
