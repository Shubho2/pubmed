In thepresent study, aqueous leaf extract of Pouteria sapota (P.sapota) was evaluatedfor its cytotoxic activity. The leaf extract was preliminarily screened forantioxidant activity using DPPH method for Radical Scavenging Activity, Hydrogen Peroxide Scavenging Activity and Reducing Power Activity. Further, the aqueousleaf extract was screened for cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cell lines(MCF-7) in vitro. The results of the study showed that aqueous extract of theP.sapota leaf was rich in phytochemicals, antioxidant activity and showed asignificant anti-cancer activity against tested MCF-7 cell lines. The presentstudy was designed to evaluate the anticancer potential of P.sapota leaf. Theantioxidants present in P.sapota have strong cytotoxic activity suggests that it can be considered for anti-cancer treatment.DOI: 10.1016/j.bbrep.2018.06.004 PMCID: PMC6039893PMID: 30003147
