Intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) has beenimplicated in a variety of immune and inflammatory responses, in addition toassociate with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we detectedTLS in the aggressive tumor phenotypes TNBC, HER2+ and luminal B, whereas the TLSnegative group contained solely tumors of the luminal A subtype. We show thatICAM1 is exclusively expressed in TNBC and HER2 enriched subtypes known to beassociated with inflammation and the formation of TLS. Furthermore, cell fromnormal mammary epithelium and breast cancer cell lines expressed ICAM1 uponstimulation with the proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL1β and IFNγ. ICAM1overexpression was induced in MCF7, MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3 cells regardless ofhormone receptor status. Taken together, our findings show that ICAM1 isexpressed in aggressive subtypes of breast cancer and its expression is inducibleby well-known proinflammatory cytokines. ICAM1 may be an attractive moleculartarget for TNBC, but further investigations elucidating the role of ICAM1 intargeted therapies have to take into consideration selective subtypes of breastcancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29604-2 PMCID: PMC6079003PMID: 30082828
