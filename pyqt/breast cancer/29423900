Multivariate logistic regressionmodels with repeated regional-level adjustments were used to explore the odds of AHT adherence. Cox proportional hazards model was conducted to assess time to thefirst 90+-day gap for persistence and a Kaplan-Meier curve were used to estimate probabilities to calculate the percentages of women who experienced 90+-day gaps in AHT.RESULTS: Of the 938 women in the cohort, 627 (66.8%) initiated the treatment. By year 1, 66.9% of women were adherent to the therapy, and by year 5, only 29% ofthose were adherent. The percentage of women with no gap in therapy greater than 90 days was 80.8%. Both higher out-of-pocket costs spent on all prescriptiondrugs except AHT and AHT-specific out-of-pocket costs were negatively associated with adherence to AHT as well as continuing AHT as recommended.CONCLUSIONS: Financial burdens including both non-AHT medication and AHT-specificout-of-pocket costs were significantly associated with adherence and persistence to the therapy.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4704-3 PMID: 29423900
