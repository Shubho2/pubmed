Just as the therapeutic choice has been optimized to match tumorgenetics, the delivery of those therapeutics should be optimized based onpatient-specific pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties. Under the currentapproach to treatment response planning and assessment, there does not exist anefficient method to consolidate biomarker changes into a holistic understandingof treatment response. While the majority of research on chemotherapies focus on cellular and genetic mechanisms of resistance, there are numerouspatient-specific and tumor-specific measures that contribute to treatmentresponse. New approaches that consolidate multimodal information into actionable data are needed. Mathematical modeling offers a solution to this problem. In thisperspective, we first focus on the particular case of breast cancer to highlight how mathematical models have shaped the current approaches to treatment. Then we compare chemotherapy to radiation therapy. Finally, we identify opportunities to improve chemotherapy treatments using the model of radiation therapy. We positthat mathematical models can improve the application of anticancer therapeuticsin the era of precision medicine. By highlighting a number of historical examplesof the contributions of mathematical models to cancer therapy, we hope that this contribution serves to engage investigators who may not have previouslyconsidered how mathematical modeling can provide real insights into breast cancertherapy.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors.
