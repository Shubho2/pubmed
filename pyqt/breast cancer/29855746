Determinations of sodium and potassium concentrations in blood samplesperformed with inductive coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Electrondensity values of blood samples were determined via ZXCOM. Statistical analyseswere performed for electron densities and Na/K ratio including Kolmogorov-Smirnovnormality tests, Spearman's rank correlation test and Mann-Whitney U test. It wasfound that the electron densities significantly differ between control and breastcancer groups. In addition, statistically significant positive correlation wasfound between the electron density and Na/K ratios in breast cancer group.DOI: 10.1007/s10534-018-0118-2 PMID: 29855746
