However, anticancer drugs can accelerate metastasis inseveral mouse metastasis models. Hence, we examined the effects of postsurgicaladministration with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, on lung metastasis process, which developed after the resection of the primary tumorarising from the orthotopic injection of a mouse triple-negative breast cancercell line, 4T1. Only 5-FU markedly increased the numbers and sizes of lungmetastasis foci, with enhanced tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis asevidenced by increases in Ki67-positive cell numbers and CD31-positive areas,respectively. 5-FU-mediated augmented lung metastasis was associated withincreases in intrapulmonary neutrophil numbers and expression of neutrophilicchemokines, Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 in tumor cells, with few effects on intrapulmonaryT-cell or macrophage numbers. 5-FU enhanced Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 expression in 4T1cells in a NFκB-dependent manner. Moreover, the administration of aneutrophil-depleting antibody or a Cxcr2 antagonist, SB225002, significantlyattenuated 5-FU-mediated enhanced lung metastasis with depressed neutrophilinfiltration. Furthermore, infiltrating neutrophils and 4T1 cells abundantlyexpressed prokineticin-2 (Prok2) and its receptor, Prokr1, respectively. Finally,the administration of 5-FU after the resection of the primary tumor failed toaugment lung metastasis in the mice receiving Prokr1-deleted 4T1 cells.Collectively, 5-FU can enhance lung metastasis by inducing tumor cells to produceCxcl1 and Cxcl2, which induced the migration of neutrophils expressing Prok2 witha capacity to enhance 4T1 cell proliferation.
