The use of these compounds is banned by the WorldAnti-Doping Agency (WADA) and controls are made through analytical methodologies such as HPLC-MS/MS, which do not fulfil the sample throughput requirements.Moreover, compounds such as tamoxifen are also used to treat hormonereceptor-positive breast cancer (ER + ).Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) oftamoxifen may also be clinically useful for guiding treatment decisions. Anaccurate determination of these drugs requires a solid phase extraction ofpatient serum followed by HPLC-MS/MS. In the context of an unmet need ofhigh-throughput screening (HTS) and quantitative methods for antiestrogenicsubstances we have approached the development of antibodies and an immunochemicalassay for the determination of these antiestrogenic compounds. The strategyapplied has taken into consideration that these drugs are metabolized andexcreted in urine as the corresponding 4-hydroxylated compounds. Amicroplate-based ELISA procedure has been developed for the analysis of thesemetabolites in urine with a LOD of 0.15, 0.16 and 0.63 μg/L for 4OH-tamoxifen,4OH-toremifen and 4OH-clomifen, respectively, much lower than the MRPLestablished by WADA (20 μg/L).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
