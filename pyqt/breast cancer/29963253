Transport activity of MCTscan be facilitated by non-catalytic interaction with carbonic anhydrase IX(CAIX), the expression of which has been shown to be upregulated under hypoxia.We have now studied the mechanisms that enable CAIX-mediated facilitation ofproton-coupled lactate transport in breast cancer cells and Xenopus oocytes. Our results indicate that the proteoglycan like (PG) domain of CAIX could function as'proton antenna' to facilitate MCT transport activity. Truncation of the PGdomain and application of a PG-binding antibody significantly reducedproton-coupled lactate transport in MCT-expressing oocytes and hypoxic breastcancer cells, respectively. Furthermore, application of the PG-binding antibodyreduced proliferation and migration of hypoxic cancer cells, suggesting thatfacilitation of proton-coupled lactate flux by the CAIX PG domain contributes to cancer cell survival under hypoxic conditions.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25371 PMCID: PMC6021347PMID: 29963253
