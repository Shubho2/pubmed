Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) consists of a low and several highmolecular weight forms (HMW-FGF2). We previously demonstrated thatantiprogestin-resistant mammary carcinomas display lower levels of progesteronereceptor A isoforms (PRA) than B isoforms (PRB). Our aim was to evaluate the roleof FGF2 isoforms in breast cancer progression. We evaluated FGF2 expression, cellproliferation, and pathway activation in models with different PRA/PRB ratios. Weperformed lentiviral infections of different FGF2 isoforms using the humanhormone-responsive T47D-YA cells, engineered to only express PRA, and evaluatedtumor growth, metastatic dissemination, and endocrine responsiveness. We assessedFGF2 expression and localization in 81 human breast cancer samples.Antiprogestin-resistant experimental mammary carcinomas with low PRA/PRB ratiosand T47D-YB cells, which only express PRB, displayed higher levels of HMW-FGF2than responsive variants. HMW-FGF2 overexpression in T47D-YA cells inducedincreased tumor growth, lung metastasis, and antiprogestin resistance compared tocontrol tumors. In human breast carcinomas categorized by their PRA/PRB ratio, wefound nuclear FGF2 expression in 55.6% of tumor cells. No differences were found between nuclear FGF2 expression and Ki67 proliferation index, tumor stage, ortumor grade. In low-grade tumor samples, moderate to high nuclear FGF2 levelswere associated to carcinomas with low PRA/PRB ratio. In conclusion, we show thatHMW-FGF2 isoforms are PRB targets which confer endocrine resistance and arelocalized in the nuclei of breast cancer samples. Hence, targeting intracellular FGF2 may contribute to overcome tumor progression.DOI: 10.1007/s12672-018-0339-4 PMID: 29956066
