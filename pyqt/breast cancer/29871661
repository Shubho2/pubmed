Prior analyses have used subjective categories to describe BPU. We evaluate a new quantitative method for assessing BPU by testing itsreproducibility, comparing quantitative results with previously establishedsubjective BPU categories, and determining the association of quantitative BPUwith breast cancer risk.METHODS: Two nonradiologist operators independently performed region-of-interest analysis on MBI images viewed in conjunction with corresponding digitalmammograms. Quantitative BPU was defined as a unitless ratio of the average pixelintensity (counts/pixel) within the fibroglandular tissue versus the averagepixel intensity in fat. Operator agreement and the correlation of quantitativeBPU measures with subjective BPU categories assessed by expert radiologists were determined. Percent density on mammograms was estimated using Cumulus. Theassociation of quantitative BPU with breast cancer (per one unit BPU) wasexamined within an established case-control study of 62 incident breast cancercases and 177 matched controls.RESULTS: Quantitative BPU ranged from 0.4 to 3.2 across all subjects and was onaverage higher in cases compared to controls (1.4 versus 1.2, p < 0.007 for both operators). Quantitative BPU was strongly correlated with subjective BPUcategories (Spearman's r = 0.59 to 0.69, p < 0.0001, for each paired combination of two operators and two radiologists). Interoperator and intraoperator agreementin the quantitative BPU measure, assessed by intraclass correlation, was 0.92 and0.98, respectively. Quantitative BPU measures showed either no correlation orweak negative correlation with mammographic percent density. In a model adjusted for body mass index and percent density, higher quantitative BPU was associatedwith increased risk of breast cancer for both operators (OR = 4.0, 95% confidenceinterval (CI) 1.6-10.1, and 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.7).CONCLUSION: Quantitative measurement of BPU, defined as the ratio of averagecounts in fibroglandular tissue relative to that in fat, can be reliablyperformed by nonradiologist operators with a simple region-of-interest analysistool. Similar to results obtained with subjective BPU categories, quantitativeBPU is a functional imaging biomarker of breast cancer risk, independent ofmammographic density and hormonal factors.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-0973-3 PMCID: PMC5989426PMID: 29871661
