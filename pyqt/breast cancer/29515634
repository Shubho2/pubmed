The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value ofquantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and Chromogenic In SituHybridization (CISH) to assess HER2 status of biopsy specimens.Methods: To elucidate the status of HER2 gene amplification, biopsies of breastcarcinoma from 120 patients with 2+ IHC status were analyzed by qPCR and CISH.Results: The results of the two experiments were compared, and it was depictedthat the concordance rate between CISH and qPCR assays was 88.1%.Thequantification of HER2 gene with CISH and qPCR showed that there was asignificant correlation (p value= 0.0001 and r= 0.808).Conclusion: The results of this research support the idea that qPCR is a precise and reproducible technique, which can be employed as a supplementary method toevaluate HER2 status.PMCID: PMC5831068PMID: 29515634
