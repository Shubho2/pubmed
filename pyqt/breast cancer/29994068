[Epub ahead of print]Identifying gene network rewiring by integrating gene expression and gene networkdata.Xu T, Ou-Yang L, Hu X, Zhang X.Exploring the rewiring pattern of gene regulatory networks between differentpathological states is an important task in bioinformatics. Although a number of computational approaches have been developed to infer differential networks from high-throughput data, most of them only focus on gene expression data. Thevaluable static gene regulatory network data accumulated in recent biomedicalresearches are neglected. In this study, we propose a new Gaussian graphicalmodel-based method to infer differential networks by integrating gene expression and static gene regulatory network data. We first evaluate the empiricalperformance of our method by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods usingsimulation data. We also apply our method to The Cancer Genome Atlas data toidentify gene network rewiring between ovarian cancers with different platinumresponses, and rewiring between breast cancers of luminal A subtype andbasal-like subtype. Hub genes in the estimated differential networks rediscoverknown genes associated with platinum resistance in ovarian cancer and signatures of the breast cancer intrinsic subtypes.DOI: 10.1109/TCBB.2018.2809603 PMID: 29994068
