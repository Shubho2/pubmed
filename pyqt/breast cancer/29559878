We present 2 cases that demonstrate the safe and effective use of thermalradiofrequency ablation (RFA) to achieve significant pain relief.Case Reports: Our first patient was a 62-year-old female who developed chronicchest pain following lumpectomy for breast cancer and failed conservativemanagement. Two intercostal diagnostic nerve blocks were performed with goodresults. One block provided pain relief for 3 weeks, and the other provided pain relief for 5 weeks. These blocks were followed by RFA that provided excellentimprovement in her pain for >1 year. Our second patient was a 67-year-old female with a history of esophageal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Shedeveloped chronic chest pain following surgery and treatment. Conservativemanagement was implemented at first without significant improvement in pain. The patient received intercostal diagnostic blocks that significantly improved herpain. She then underwent RFA for the same nerves and had resolution of her painat 2-month follow-up.Conclusion: Our cases suggest that thermal RFA can be safely used to treatpatients suffering from intercostal neuralgia. This unique treatment hassignificant implications for chronic pain physicians and warrants additionalstudies to elucidate its effectiveness, safety profile, and scope of use.PMCID: PMC5855433PMID: 29559878
