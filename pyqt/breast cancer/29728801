We attempted to develop such a prediction model focusing on thedifferences in gene expression between breast cancers with early and laterecurrence.METHODS: For the training set, 779 ER-positive breast cancers treated withtamoxifen alone for 5 years were selected from the databases (GSE6532, GSE12093, GSE17705, and GSE26971). For the validation set, 221 ER-positive breast cancerstreated with adjuvant hormonal therapy for 5 years with or without chemotherapyat our hospital were included. Gene expression was assayed by DNA microarrayanalysis (Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0).RESULTS: With the 42 genes differentially expressed in early and late recurrence breast cancers in the training set, a prediction model (42GC) for late recurrencewas constructed. The patients classified by 42GC into the late recurrence-likegroup showed a significantly (P = 0.006) higher late recurrence rate as expected but a significantly (P = 1.62 × E-13) lower rate for early recurrence thannon-late recurrence-like group. These observations were confirmed for thevalidation set, i.e., P = 0.020 for late recurrence and P = 5.70 × E-5 for early recurrence.CONCLUSION: We developed a unique prediction model (42GC) for late recurrence by focusing on the biological differences between breast cancers with early and laterecurrence. Interestingly, patients in the late recurrence-like group by 42GCwere at low risk for early recurrence.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4812-0 PMID: 29728801
