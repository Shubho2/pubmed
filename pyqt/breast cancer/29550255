To examine how microenvironmental signalsinfluence resistance, we monitored TKI-treated breast cancer cell lines grown on microenvironment microarrays composed of printed extracellular matrix proteinssupplemented with soluble proteins. We tested ∼2,500 combinations of 56 solubleand 46 matrix microenvironmental proteins on basal-like HER2+ (HER2E) orluminal-like HER2+ (L-HER2+) cells treated with the TKIs lapatinib or neratinib. In HER2E cells, hepatocyte growth factor, a ligand for MET, induced resistancethat could be reversed with crizotinib, an inhibitor of MET. In L-HER2+ cells,neuregulin1-β1 (NRG1β), a ligand for HER3, induced resistance that could bereversed with pertuzumab, an inhibitor of HER2-HER3 heterodimerization. Thesubtype-specific responses were also observed in 3D cultures and murinexenografts. These results, along with bioinformatic pathway analysis and siRNAknockdown experiments, suggest different mechanisms of resistance specific toeach HER2+ subtype: MET signaling for HER2E and HER2-HER3 heterodimerization for L-HER2+ cells.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.
