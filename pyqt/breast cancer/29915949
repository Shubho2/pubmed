Thetreatment of CRF includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies;dietary strategies with promising results have also been used. This study aimedto identify dietary supplements that improve fatigue in patients with breastcancer.METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted according to thePreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.Data were obtained from PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL databasesusing the following MeSH terms: breast neoplasms, dietary supplements, diet, and fatigue. In addition, the Google and Google Scholar search engines were used tofind grey literature. Methodological quality was evaluated using the risk of biasin randomised clinical trials in the systematic Cochrane reviews, and the qualityof the evidence was also analysed using the GRADE system.RESULTS: A total of 893 studies were assessed, of which eight were included inthe review, with 932 women diagnosed with breast cancer. The most commonly usedsupplements that improve fatigue were guarana, acetyl-L-carnitine, and co-enzyme Q10. Two studies had a low risk of bias in all categories and three hadhigh-quality evidence.CONCLUSIONS: Dietary supplements or diet patterns are seldom used to treatfatigue in patients with breast cancer. The results of this review showed thatguarana extract and a diet rich in whole foods, omega-3 fatty acids, fruits, and vegetables could be used to treat CRF in patients with breast cancer. The studieshad a low risk of bias with high-quality evidence on the efficacy of theinterventions in treating fatigue in the study population.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4857-0 PMID: 29915949
