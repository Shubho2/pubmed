Patients were divided into four subtypes:luminal A, luminal B, Her2, or triple negative (TN). Multivariable logisticregression ascertained factors associated with developing pCR. Kaplan-Meieranalysis evaluated overall survival (OS) between patients by degree of responseto NC when stratifying patients by subtype.RESULTS: Of a total of 13,939 women, 322 (2%) were luminal A, 5941 (43%) luminal B, 2274 (16%) Her2, and 5402 (39%) TN. Overall, 19% of all patients achieved pCR,the lowest in luminal A (0.3%) and the highest in Her2 (38.7%). Molecular subtypewas an independent predictor of both pCR and OS in this population. Clinicaldownstaging was associated with improved survival, mostly in women with luminalB, Her2, and TN subtypes. Subgroup analysis of the pCR population demonstrated5-year OS in the luminal B, Her2, and TN cohorts of 93.0, 94.2, and 90.6%,respectively (Her2 vs. TN, p = 0.016).CONCLUSIONS: Assessing nearly 14,000 women from a contemporary United Statesdatabase, this is the largest known study examining the relationship betweenresponse to NC and molecular subtype. Women with luminal A disease are the least likely to undergo pCR, with the highest rates in Her2 disease. Degree of responseis associated with OS, especially in luminal B, Her2, and TN patients. Despitethe comparatively higher likelihood of achieving pCR in TN cases, this subgroupmay still experience a survival detriment, which has implications for an ongoing national randomized trial.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4801-3 PMID: 29693228
