In this paper, we evaluatemedication-taking behaviors based on social cognitive theory (SCT), presentingpatterns of adherence stratified across SCT constructs in 33 breast cancersurvivors over an 8-month period. Findings indicate that medication adherence is a very personal experience influenced by many simultaneously interacting factors,and a deeper contextual understanding is needed to understand and developinterventions targeting non-adherence.DOI: 10.1109/BHI.2018.8333422 PMCID: PMC5983047PMID: 29862383
