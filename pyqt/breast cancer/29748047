A retrospective analysis of screeningperformance metrics for tomosynthesis mammograms interpreted in 2015 whenmammograms were read immediately was compared to historical controls from 2013 to2014 when mammograms were batch interpreted after the patient had departed. Atotal of 5518 screening tomosynthesis mammograms (n = 1212 for batchinterpretation and n = 4306 for immediate interpretation) were evaluated. Thelarger sample size for the latter group reflects a group practice shift toperforming tomosynthesis for the majority of patients. Age, breast density,comparison examinations, and high-risk status were compared. An asymptoticproportion test and multivariable analysis were used to compare performancemetrics.RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in recall or cancerdetection rates for the batch interpretation group compared to immediateinterpretation group with respective recall rate of 6.5% vs 5.3% = +1.2% (95%confidence interval -0.3 to 2.7%; P = .101) and cancer detection rate of 6.6 vs7.2 per thousand = -0.6 (95% confidence interval -5.9 to 4.6; P = .825). Therewas no statistically significant difference in positive predictive values (PPVs) including PPV1 (screening recall), PPV2 (biopsy recommendation), or PPV 3 (biopsyperformed) with batch interpretation (10.1%, 42.1%, and 40.0%, respectively) and immediate interpretation (13.6%, 39.2%, and 39.7%, respectively). After adjustingfor age, breast density, high-risk status, and comparison mammogram, there was nodifference in the odds of being recalled or cancer detection between the twogroups.CONCLUSIONS: There is no statistically significant difference in interpretationperformance metrics for screening tomosynthesis mammograms interpretedimmediately compared to those interpreted in a delayed fashion.Copyright © 2018.
