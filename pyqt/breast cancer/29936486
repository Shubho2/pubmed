DSH values of the percentage ofmaximum dose (Dmax) were measured.RESULTS: All patients completed the treatment; the median follow-up period was22.1 months. The 2-year overall survival and local control rates were 85% and95%. Five patients developed grade 2 acute radiation dermatitis, and nonedeveloped grade 2 or higher late radiation dermatitis. The median Dmax inpatients who developed grade 0-1 and grade 2 acute radiation dermatitis was 5,178and 5,365 cGy (p=0.03).CONCLUSION: PMRT without bolus resulted in a low frequency of grade 2 or higherradiation dermatitis without increasing locoregional recurrences, and the Dmaxwas the contributing factor for developing acute radiation dermatitis.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/invivo.11335 PMID: 29936486
