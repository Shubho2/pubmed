Electronic address:nanzdchem@163.com.We describe a facile method to synthesize a new type of catalyst byelectrodepositing Ag nanocrystals (AgNCs) on the different polymer dyes, Poly(methylene blue) (PMB) or Poly (4-(2-Pyridylazo)-Resorcinol) (PAR) modifiedgraphene‑carbon spheres (GS) hybrids. The self-assembled GS take dual advantages of carbon spheres and graphene. Carbon spheres acts as nano-spacers prevent theaggregation of graphene and guarantee the fast electron transfer of GS. Secondly,polymerized dyes used here are beneficial for AgNCs growing as a linker. Theeffects of dyes on the growth habits, morphologies and catalytic properties forAgNCs were investigated. A novel electrochemical nonenzymatic sensor for hydrogenperoxide (H2O2) detection is fabricated based on the Ag/Polymer dyes/GS ternarycomposites modified glass carbon electrode (GCE) for the first time. It was foundthat the proposed electrodes, especially for Ag/PMB/GS/GCE, displayed a peculiar electrocatalytic activity towards H2O2 reduction synergistically as compared toAg/PAR/GS/GCE or Ag/GS/GCE alone. Ag/PMB/GS/GCE showed a linear response over theH2O2 concentration range of 0.5 to 1112 μM. The detection limit and sensitivityis 0.15 μM and 400 μA mM-1 cm-2, respectively. These outstanding results enablethe practical application of Ag/PMB/GS/GCE for the H2O2 tracking released fromMCF-7 (human breast cancer cells) with satisfactory results.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
