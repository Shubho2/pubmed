Upon initial presentation at the Department of Oral Medicine,Hokkaido University Hospital, the patient's mandibular molar teeth were extractedbecause of severe periodontal disease. Two months later, epithelialization of thesockets was observed and treatment with anti-resorptive drugs was started forbone metastases. One year after tooth extraction, bone exposure in the rightlower first molar region was observed, and stage 2 medication-related ONJ (MRONJ)was diagnosed. Up to this time, the patient had received zoledronic acid twiceand denosumab 22 times. Denosumab was discontinued by the oncologist, and oralantibiotics with rinsing of the exposed bone area were prescribed. By 36 weeksafter discontinuation of denosumab, a sequestrum in the posterior part of themandible was naturally shed, and the site was healed. Bisphosphonate is depositedin bones, whereas denosumab functions extracellularly and circulates in theblood. The effect of denosumab on bone remodeling is reversed shortly after thedrug has been discontinued.DOI: 10.2334/josnusd.17-0027 PMID: 29576576
