Participants generally agreed that learning to use Lifein a Day was easy (83%, 33/40) and would prefer to log activities using Life in aDay over paper-and-pencil diary (73%, 29/40). A slight majority felt thatcompleting Life in a Day for 5 consecutive days was not too much (60%, 24/40) or overly time-consuming (68%, 27/40). Life in a Day was rated as easy to read (88%,35/40) and navigate (70%, 32/40). Participants also agreed that it was easy tolog activities using the activity timer at the start and end of an activity (90%,35/39). Only 13% (5/40) downloaded the app on their personal phone, whereas 63%(19/30) of the remaining participants would have preferred to use their personal phone. Overall, 77% (30/39) of participants felt that the Life in a Day app wasgood or very good. Those who agreed that it was easy to edit activities weresignificantly more likely to be younger when compared with those who disagreed(mean 53 vs 58 years, P=.04). Similarly, those who agreed that it was easy toremember to log activities were more likely to be younger (mean 52 vs 60 years,P<.001). Qualitative coding of 2 open-ended survey items yielded 3 common themes for Life in a Day improvement (ie, convenience, user interface, and reminders).CONCLUSIONS: A mobile phone app is an acceptable time-use measurement modality.Improving convenience, user interface, and memory prompts while addressing theneeds of older participants is needed to enhance app utility.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00929617;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00929617 (Archived by WebCite athttp://www.webcitation.org/6z2bZ4P7X).Â©Matthew Cole Ainsworth, Dori Pekmezi, Heather Bowles, Diane Ehlers, EdwardMcAuley, Kerry S Courneya, Laura Q Rogers.
