We examined the biological effects of HER2-heterogeneity onmouse models and analyzed metastatic brains by RNA sequence analysis. Ametastatic mouse model was developed using 231-Luc (triple negative cells) and 2 HER2-positive cell lines, namely, HER2-60 and HER2-90 which showed heterogeneous and monotonous HER2 expressions, respectively. Metastatic lesions developed in 3 weeks in all the mice injected with HER2-60 cells, and in 69% of the miceinjected with HER2-90 and 87.5% of the mice injected with 231-Luc. The mediansurvival days of mice injected with 231-Luc, HER2-60, and HER2-90 cells were 29(n = 24), 24 (n = 22) and 30 (n = 13) days, respectively. RNA sequence analysisshowed that CASP-1 and its related genes were significantly downregulated inmetastatic brain tumors with HER2-60 cells. The low expression of caspase-1 couldbe a new prognostic biomarker for early relapse in HER2-positive breast cancer.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19082158 PMID: 30042341
