Recent evidence suggests that Endostar may induce vascularnormalization, thereby improving tumor perfusion and systemic chemotherapy.However, the molecular mechanism by which Endostar makes chemotherapy moreeffective remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, established 4T1 breasttumor-bearing animals treated with Endostar were evaluated at serial time points for treatment-associated changes in vascular architecture. As a result, Endostar induced a morphologically and functionally normalized vascular network. Combined Endostar and doxorubicin exhibited significant antitumor (34% of control size)and antimetastatic effects (29% of control metastatic nodules) in vivo. Finally, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDIQ-TOF MS/MS-based proteomicsapproach was used to identify differentially expressed proteins involved invascular normalization during Endostar administration. SRCIN1 was detected as oneof the most significantly increased proteins. SRCIN1 is a novel Src-bindingprotein that regulates Src activation through C-terminal Src kinase, andattenuated Src activation during Endostar treatment was further confirmed byimmunoblotting. Collectively, these data provided a molecular basis for vascular normalization, which were associated with the observed synergistic effect invivo.DOI: 10.1089/cbr.2017.2399 PMID: 29694242
