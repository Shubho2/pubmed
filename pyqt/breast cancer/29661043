[Epubahead of print]Risks and consequences of travel burden on prophylactic granulocytecolony-stimulating factor administration and incidence of febrile neutropenia in an aged Medicare population.Stephens JM(1), Bensink M(2), Bowers C(2), Hollenbeak CS(3).Author information: (1)a Prima Health Analytics , Weymouth , MA , USA.(2)b Amgen, Inc. , Thousand Oaks , CA , USA.(3)c The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine , Hershey , PA , USA.OBJECTIVE: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) decrease the incidenceof febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. This study examines the impact patient travel burden has on administration ofprophylactic G-CSFs and the subsequent impact on FN incidence.METHODS: Medicare claims data were used to identify a cohort of beneficiaries age65+ with non-myeloid cancers at high risk for FN between January 2012 andDecember 2014. Driving distance and time were calculated from patient residenceZIP code to the location of G-CSF and/or chemotherapy administration. Regression models were used to estimate the odds of G-CSF prophylaxis relative to patientdriving distance and time, and odds of FN incidence relative to timing of G-CSFadministration (optimal [days 2-4 after chemotherapy], sub-optimal [same day], ornone).RESULTS: The 52,389 study patients had a mean age of 73.5 years, and were 82%female and 89% white race; 49% had female breast cancer, 12% lung cancer, 15%ovarian cancer, and 24% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Of these high FN risk patients,69% had at least one prophylactic G-CSF administration within at least onechemotherapy cycle. The percentage of patients receiving prophylactic G-CSFs inthe first cycle was 56%. Median travel time was slightly longer for patients who did not receive G-CSFs and patients receiving short-acting vs long-acting G-CSFs.The odds of receiving no G-CSFs were 26-52% higher (depending on cancer type) forpatients with aâ€‰>80-min one-way travel time, compared to patients traveling<20-min. Concurrently, the odds of FN (using a "narrow" definition) were 18-93%higher for patients who did not receive G-CSFs in the first cycle ofchemotherapy.CONCLUSIONS: Travel burden, linked to clinic visits for G-CSF administrationfollowing myelosuppressive chemotherapy, is associated with sub-optimal use ofG-CSF prophylaxis, which may result in a higher incidence of FN.DOI: 10.1080/03007995.2018.1465906 PMID: 29661043
