However, dataabout local re-irradiation in case of local failure after SRS (re-SRS) are rare. We evaluated the feasibility, efficacy and patient selection characteristics intreating locally recurrent metastases with a second course of SRS.METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients with brain metastases treated withre-SRS for local tumor progression between 2011 and 2017. Patient and treatmentcharacteristics as well as rates of tumor control, survival and toxicity wereanalyzed.RESULTS: Overall, 32 locally recurrent brain metastases in 31 patients wereirradiated with re-SRS. Median age at re-SRS was 64.9 years. The primaryhistology was breast cancer and non-small-cellular lung cancer (NSCLC) inrespectively 10 cases (31.3%), in 5 cases malignant melanoma (15.6%). In thefirst SRS-course 19 metastases (59.4%) and in the re-SRS-course 29 metastases(90.6%) were treated with CyberKnife® and the others with Gamma Knife. Medianplanning target volume (PTV) for re-SRS was 2.5 cm3 (range, 0.1-37.5 cm3) andmedian dose prescribed to the PTV was 19 Gy (range, 12-28 Gy) in 1-5 fractions tothe median 69% isodose (range, 53-80%). The 1-year overall survival rate was61.7% and the 1-year local control rate was 79.5%. The overall rate ofradiological radio-necrosis was 16.1% and four patients (12.9%) experienced grade≥ 3 toxicities.CONCLUSIONS: A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases after prior local SRS appears to be feasible with acceptable toxicity and can beconsidered as salvage treatment option for selected patients with highperformance status. Furthermore, this is the first study utilizing roboticradiosurgery for this indication, as an additional option for framelessfractionated treatment.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0198692 PMCID: PMC5991396PMID: 29874299
