In order to increaseresponse rate and decrease unnecessary use, robust biomarkers that predictresponse to therapy are needed.Patients and methods: We performed an integrated genomic approach combiningdifferential analysis of gene expression and DNA copy number in sensitivecompared with resistant triple-negative breast cancers in two independentneoadjuvant cisplatin-treated cohorts. Functional relevance of significant hitswas investigated in vitro by overexpression, knockdown and targeted inhibitortreatment.Results: We identified two genes, the Bloom helicase (BLM) and Fanconi anemiacomplementation group I (FANCI), that have both increased DNA copy number andgene expression in the platinum-sensitive cases. Increased level of expression ofthese two genes was also associated with platinum but not with taxane response inovarian cancer. As a functional validation, we found that overexpression of BLMpromotes DNA damage and induces sensitivity to cisplatin but has no effect onpaclitaxel sensitivity.Conclusions: A biomarker based on the expression levels of the BLM and FANCIgenes is a potential predictor of platinum sensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer.DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdy049 PMCID: PMC5913643PMID: 29452344
