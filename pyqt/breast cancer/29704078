Physical and mental health items from the Patient-Reported OutcomesMeasurement Information System (PROMIS) global health scale were used to assessdifferences in HRQOL.RESULTS: For summary physical and mental health measures, no significantdifferences were found between breast cancer survivors and women with no history of cancer; survivors of other cancers reported poorer physical and mental health than did women with no history of cancer. Similar differences were found at theitem level. When we examined the two African-American female cancer survivorgroups, we found that cancer survivors whose cancer was being treated reportedsubstantially poorer physical health and mental health than did those whosecancer was not being treated. Survivors who had private insurance and were cancerfree reported better physical and mental health than did those who did not haveprivate insurance and those who were not cancer free. Breast cancer survivorsreported slightly better physical and mental health than did survivors of othercancers.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the need for public health agencies to adopt practices to improve the mental and physical health of African-American femalesurvivors of cancer.DOI: 10.1007/s11136-018-1862-z PMID: 29704078
