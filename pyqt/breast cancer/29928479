TOP2A overexpression correlated strongly with non-luminalA subtype (Ï‡2-test, p < 0.001). TOP2A overexpression was significantly associatedwith relapse-free survival in luminal B breast cancer (n = 316; log rank test, p < 0.001) but not in other breast cancer subtypes. Cox regression analysis showed that TOP2A overexpression is a significant prognostic factor in luminal B breast cancer (hazard ratio (HR) 4.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-9.54, p =0.002). TOP2A amplified was recognized in HER2 positive breast cancer (p <0.001). In HER2 positive breast cancer, TOP2A amplified (HR 0.30, 95% CI0.085-1.07, p = 0.063) appeared to be a better prognostic factor.Conclusion: In modern tailored therapy, TOP2A overexpression can be a poorprognostic factor in luminal B breast cancer. In contrast, TOP2A amplified could be a better prognostic factor in HER2 positive breast cancer.Materials and methods: Between May 2005 and April 2015, a total of 643consecutive non-metastatic invasive breast cancers were evaluated for TOP2Aamplified using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (FISH) and for TOP2A overexpression using the immunohistochemistry assay. FISH ratios of 2 or higherwere designated as TOP2A amplified, and TOP2A staining >10% was defined as TOP2A overexpression. The prognostic values of TOP2A amplified and TOP2A overexpressionwere retrospectively evaluated.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25468 PMCID: PMC6003555PMID: 29928479
