The patient had no previous history of malignancy.DIAGNOSES: A contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography scan revealed a leftbreast mass and infiltrative soft tissue masses in the mediastinum andretroperitoneum, which showed high fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emissiontomography scan. The left breast mass was proven as a malignancy on biopsy andsurgical excisional biopsy of the mediastinal mass revealed metastasis from thebreast cancer on histopathologic examination.INTERVENTIONS: Our patient was treated with palliative hormone therapy for theprimary breast cancer and metastasis with mediastinal and retroperitonealfibrosis.OUTCOMES: Follow-up imaging studies showed improvement of the primary breastcancer and also metastasis.LESSONS: We report this rare case to emphasize that mediastinal andretroperitoneal fibrosis can be a presentation of metastasis from various primarymalignancies. We expect that appropriate diagnosis and treatment for metastaticmediastinal and retroperitoneal fibrosis can have a beneficial effect on disease course and prognosis of the patient.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011842 PMID: 30095661
