Therefore,various surfactant-based (tween-60) vesicles of doxorubicin (DOX; achemotherapeutic drug) and quercetin (QC; a chemosensitizer) were prepared. Toload siRNA on niosomes, 1, 2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) wasused as a cationic lipid. The optimum formulation containingtween-60:cholesterol:DPPC:DOTAP:DSPE-PEG2000 at 49.5:5.5:15:25:5 demonstratedthat the vesicle size and zeta potential were 52.8 ± 2.7 nm and +27.4 ± 2.3 mV,respectively. Entrapment efficiency (EE%) for DOX and QC was 86.4 ± 2.1% and94.9 ± 3.9%, respectively. Moreover, the drug release during 6 h was 32.1 ± 1.6% and 30.5 ± 1.3% for DOX and QC, respectively denoted on the controlled release.The gel retardation assay demonstrated that siRNA could be successfully loadedinto a cationic niosome:siRNA in a weight ratio 40:1. Additionally,noisome-encapsulated drugs had a higher toxicity against cancer cells whencompared with un-encapsulated forms and the synergistic effects of co-delivery ofsiRNA and DOX with QC on gastric, prostate, breast cancer cells as well as human foreskin fibroblast as a normal cell line was shown. The results showed that the co-delivery of drugs and siRNA using cationic PEGylated niosomes exhibited anincreased anti-cancer activity against the tumor cell death. It seems thatcationic PEGylated niosomes have opened up a new avenue to enrich thearmamentarium of therapeutic agents to fight cancer.DOI: 10.1080/21691401.2018.1489271 PMID: 30033768
