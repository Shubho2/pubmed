Weprospectively investigated the association between these factors and type 2diabetes risk in a large Japanese cohort.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were 37,511 women aged 45-75 years whoparticipated in the baseline (1990-1993), second (1995-1998) and third surveys(2000-2003) of the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study, and whohad no history of diabetes at the second survey. Menstrual and reproductivehistory was ascertained using questionnaires at the baseline and second surveys. Odds ratios of self-reported, physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes over the 5-yearperiod from the second survey were estimated using logistic regression.RESULTS: At the third survey, 513 new cases of type 2 diabetes wereself-reported. The odds ratios of type 2 diabetes tended to increase with thenumber of parity, after adjustment for covariates other than body mass index (Pfor trend = 0.029). The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios of type 2 diabetes forwomen with three or more births was 1.56 (95% confidence interval 0.96-2.53)compared with those who were nulliparous. The association between parity and type2 diabetes risk was attenuated after additional adjustment for body mass index (Pfor trend = 0.12). No factors other than parity were significantly associatedwith type 2 diabetes risk.CONCLUSIONS: Higher parity might be associated with an increased risk of type 2diabetes among Japanese women, partly through increasing bodyweight.Â© 2018 The Authors.
