Nevertheless, these technologiessuffer from inherent low throughput which prohibits deep sequencing at reasonablecost without target enrichment. Here, we optimized Cas9-Assisted Targeting ofCHromosome segments (CATCH) for nanopore sequencing of the breast cancer geneBRCA1. A 200 kb target containing the 80 kb BRCA1 gene body and its flankingregions was isolated intact from primary human peripheral blood cells, allowinglong-range amplification and long-read nanopore sequencing. The target wasenriched 237-fold and sequenced at up to 70Ã— coverage on a single flow-cell.Overall performance and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling weredirectly compared to Illumina sequencing of the same enriched sample,highlighting the benefits of CATCH for targeted sequencing. The CATCH enrichment scheme only requires knowledge of the target flanking sequence for Cas9 cleavage while providing contiguous data across both coding and non-coding sequence andholds promise for characterization of complex disease-related or highly variable genomic regions.DOI: 10.1093/nar/gky411 PMID: 29788371
