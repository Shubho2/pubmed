We collected data on several predictors of exercise adherence at baseline and used linear and mixed-effect models to determinepredictors of exercise adherence to exercise volume and overall.Results: Adherence was higher in the moderate-volume group (84.5%) compared with the high-volume group (75.2%; p < .001). There were no statistically significant interactions between predictors of exercise adherence and exercise volume.Overall, we found that exercise adherence was predicted by randomization group,body mass index (BMI), employment status, and physical health. Adherence was 8.6%lower in the high-volume versus moderate-volume group, 6.7% lower for womenworking full time versus not, 0.8% lower per BMI increase of 1 kg/m2, and 0.5%higher per unit of physical health.Conclusions: Adherence to high-volume aerobic exercise was more challenging than for moderate-volume aerobic exercise, but the predictors of adherence weresimilar. Moreover, few factors were major predictors of exercise adherence inthis setting suggesting that well-controlled efficacy trials that produce highadherence rates may reduce the influence of individual characteristics onexercise adherence.Trial Registration: NCT1435005.DOI: 10.1093/abm/kay057 PMID: 30020401
