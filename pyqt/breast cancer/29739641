The aim of this study was to quantify the proportion of the cancer burden in the Nordic countries linked to alcohol and estimate the potential for cancerprevention by changes in alcohol consumption.METHODS: Using the Prevent macro-simulation model, the number of cancer cases in the Nordic countries over a 30-year period (2016-2045) was modelled for sixsites, under different scenarios of changing alcohol consumption, and compared tothe projected number of cases if constant alcohol consumption prevailed. Thestudied sites were colorectal, post-menopausal breast, oral cavity and pharynx,liver, larynx as well as oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The alcoholconsumption was based on the categories of non-drinkers/occasional drinkers,light drinkers (<=12.5 g alcohol per day), moderate drinkers (>12.5and ≤ 50 g/day) and heavy drinkers (>50 g/day).RESULTS: About 83,000 cancer cases could be avoided in the Nordic countries in a 30-year period if alcohol consumption was entirely eliminated, which is 5.5% ofthe expected number of cases for the six alcohol-related cancer types. With a 50%reduction in the proportion with moderate alcohol consumption by year 2025,21,500 cancer cases could be avoided. The number of avoidable cases was highestfor post-menopausal breast and colorectal cancer, but the percentage was highest for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.CONCLUSION: The results from this study can be used to understand the potentialimpact and significance of primary prevention programmes targeted towardsreducing the alcohol consumption in the Nordic countries.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
