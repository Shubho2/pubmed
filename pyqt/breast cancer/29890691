In the present work, synthesis of newheterocyclic derivatives based on Curcumin was studied. Compound 3 wassynthesized via the reaction of furochromone carbaldehyde (1) with Curcumin (2)using pipredine as catalyst. Also, novel, 4,9-dimethoxy-5H-furo [3, 2-g]chromen-5-one derivatives 4a⁻d, 6a⁻d, 7, 8a⁻d, 9 and 10 were synthesized by thereactions of furochromone carbaldehyde (1) with different reagents (namely:appropriate amine 3a⁻d, appropriate hydrazine 5a⁻d, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, urea/thiourea, malononitrile, malononitrile with hydrazine hydrate). Thestructure of the synthesized products had been confirmed from their spectroscopicdata (IR, ¹H-NMR, 13C-NMR and mass spectra). In the present investigation, thenewly synthesized products were screened using the MTT colorimetric assay fortheir in vitro inhibition capacity in two human cancer cell lines (hepatocellularcarcinoma (HEPG2) and breast cancer (MCF-7) as well as the normal cell line(human normal melanocyte, HFB4) in comparison to the known anticancer drugs:5-flurouracil and doxorubicin. The anticancer activity results indicated that thesynthesized products 4c and 8b showed growth inhibition activity against HEPG2cell line and synthesized products 4b and 8a showed growth inhibition activityagainst MCF-7, but with varying intensities in comparison to the known anticancerdrugs, 5-flurouracil and doxorubicin. Cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), a majorcell cycle protein, was identified as a potential molecular target of Curcumin.Furthermore, Curcumin induced G1 cell cycle arrest, which is regulated by CDK2 incancer cells. Therefore, we used molecular modelling to study in silico thepossible inhibitory effect of CDK2 by Curcumin derivatives as a possiblemechanism of these compounds as anticancer agents. The molecular docking studyrevealed that compounds 4b, 8a and 8b were the most effective compounds ininhibiting CDk2, and, this result was in agreement with cytotoxicity assay.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23061398 PMID: 29890691
