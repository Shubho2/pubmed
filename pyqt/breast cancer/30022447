[Epub ahead ofprint]CD147 (EMMPRIN) controls malignant properties of breast cancer cells byinterdependent signaling of Wnt and JAK/STAT pathways.Knutti N(1), Huber O(1), Friedrich K(2).Author information: (1)Institute of Biochemistry II, Jena University Hospital, Nonnenplan 2-4, 07743,Jena, Germany.(2)Institute of Biochemistry II, Jena University Hospital, Nonnenplan 2-4, 07743,Jena, Germany. karlheinz.friedrich@med.uni-jena.de.EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer, EMN, CD147) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed in numerous cell types both as asoluble and a membrane-spanning glycoprotein. It is involved in manyphysiological processes, as well as in cancer. This study addresses mechanisms ofcrosstalk between EMN-driven cancer-related cellular responses and the canonical Wnt-pathway in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. Genetic knockdown of EMN in MCF-7resulted in characteristic changes in cellular shape, organization of the actincytoskeleton and malignancy profile, indicating that EMN expression repressescell motility, but, in contrast, exerts a stimulatory effect on cellproliferation and invasive properties. Increased invasiveness coincided withelevated expression of Wnt-target genes and established invasion driver matrixmetalloproteinase MMP14. Activation of the downstream Wnt-pathway by means ofheterologous β-catenin and/or TCF-4 expression, through inhibition of GSK-3β byLiCl treatment, or by cell stimulation with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) resulted in increased EMN expression. EMN over-expression raised the ratio of thetwo opposing Wnt pathway-driven transcription factors Sp1 and Sp5, leading tostimulation of the EMN promoter. Furthermore, the EMN promoter was activated by afeed-forward circuit involving an EMN-dependent drop in expression of therepressive signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). Takentogether, we show that the influence of EMMPRIN on malignancy-related properties of breast cancer cells is functionally connected to both Wnt- and JAK/STATpathways.DOI: 10.1007/s11010-018-3406-9 PMID: 30022447
