HChrR6 is an improved bacterial enzyme that convertsCNOB into the cytotoxic drug MCHB. Extracellular vesicles (EV) were used formRNA-based HchrR6 gene delivery: EVs may cause minimal immune rejection, and mRNAmay be superior to DNA for gene delivery. To confine HChrR6 generation and CNOBactivation to the cancer, the EVHB chimeric protein was constructed. It contains high-affinity anti-HER2 scFv antibody (ML39) and is capable of latching on to EV surface. Cells transfected with EVHB-encoding plasmid generated EVs displayingthis protein ("directed EVs"). Transfection of a separate batch of cells with thenew plasmid, XPort/HChrR6, generated EVs containing HChrR6 mRNA; incubation with pure EVHB enabled these to target the HER2 receptor, generating "EXO-DEPT" EVs.EXO-DEPT treatment specifically enabled HER2-overexpressing BT474 cells toconvert CNOB into MCHB in actinomycin D-independent manner, showing successfuland specific delivery of HChrR6 mRNA. EXO-DEPTs-but not undirected EVs-plus CNOB caused near-complete growth arrest of orthotopic BT474 xenografts in vivo,demonstrating for the first time EV-mediated delivery of functional exogenousmRNA to tumors. EXO-DEPTs may be generated from patients' own dendritic cells to evade immune rejection, and without plasmids and their potentially harmfulgenetic material, raising the prospect of clinical use of this regimen. Thisapproach can be used to treat any disease overexpressing a specific marker.
