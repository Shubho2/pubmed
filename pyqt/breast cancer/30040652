[Epub ahead of print]Deep Manifold Preserving Autoencoder for Classifying Breast CancerHistopathological Images.Feng Y, Zhang L, Mo J.Classifying breast cancer histopathological images automatically is an important task in computer assisted pathology analysis. However, extracting informative andnon-redundant features for histopathological image classification is challenging due to the appearance variability caused by the heterogeneity of the disease, thetissue preparation, and staining processes. In this paper, we propose a newfeature extractor, called deep manifold preserving autoencoder, to learndiscriminative features from unlabeled data. Then, we integrate the proposedfeature extractor with a softmax classifier to classify breast cancerhistopathology images. Specifically, it learns hierarchal features from unlabeledimage patches by minimizing the distance between its input and output, andsimultaneously preserving the geometric structure of the whole input data set.After the unsupervised training, we connect the encoder layers of the traineddeep manifold preserving autoencoder with a softmax classifier to construct acascade model and fine-tune this deep neural network with labeled training data. The proposed method learns discriminative features by preserving the structure ofthe input datasets from the manifold learning view and minimizing reconstruction error from the deep learning view from a large amount of unlabeled data.Extensive experiments on the public breast cancer dataset (BreaKHis) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.DOI: 10.1109/TCBB.2018.2858763 PMID: 30040652
