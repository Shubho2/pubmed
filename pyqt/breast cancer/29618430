The current study investigates the antiproliferative andanti-inflammatory action of the ethyl acetate fraction of Penicillium crustosumfrom Phoenix dactylifera. This paper reports the isolation of P. crustosum fromleaves of P. dactylifera and the antiproliferative activities of ethyl acetatefraction on cancer cells. To reach this goal, the anti-proliferation andcytotoxicity effects were evaluated by MTT and LDH assay respectively. Thequantitative real time PCR technique was used to investigate IL-6 and IL-8 geneexpression. Our results revealed higher anti-proliferative activity against HepG2(82μg/ml) than MCF7 (126μg/ml) and inhibited the migration of the cell lines. Theethyl acetate fraction significantly altered LDH levels and reduced IL-6transcript expression on MCF7 cell line but not in HepG2 cell line which could bespecific anti-inflammatory drug in breast cancer cell line. These results suggestthat Phoenix dactylifera extract has a potent anti-proliferative andanti-inflammatory action. Further investigation to isolate the active compoundsand mode of action is required.PMID: 29618430
