Electronic address: lklszlym@163.com.Doxorubicin (Dox) is an efficient drug for breast cancer chemotherapy, however,its toxic side effects on non-tumor tissues, especially on myocardial cells,sometimes limit its clinical application. Therefore, it is necessary to develop anew drug, which can be combined with Dox to potentiate the anti-tumor effect ofDox at a lower concentration and attenuate the toxic side effects of it.Quercetin (Que) has anti-tumor activity in addition to its protective effects on various cells. By preparing human non-tumoral MCF-10A mammary cells, human breastcancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and human myocardial AC16 cells, here, wewanted to evaluate whether Que might represent such an agent and investigate its possible mechanisms of potentiating the anti-tumor effect of Dox at a lowerconcentration. The results showed that Que could increase intracellularaccumulation of Dox in breast cancer cells through down-regulating the expressionof efflux ABC transporters including P-gp, BCRP and MRP1, which can effectivelyeliminate cancerous cells including breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), therebypotentiating the anti-tumor effect of Dox. Furthermore, Que attenuated thecytotoxicity of Dox to non-tumoral MCF-10A mammary cells and myocardial AC16cells. Therefore, Que could be used as a novel agent combined with Dox in breast cancer therapy, which could potentiate the anti-tumor effect of Dox at a lowerconcentration and attenuate the toxic side effects of it.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
