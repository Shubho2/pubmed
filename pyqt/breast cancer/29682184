It is the result of a complex interplay between tumor cells, tumorinfiltrating immune cells and other stromal cells. Myeloid cells in the tumormicroenvironment are considered major drivers of tumor progression and metastasisand increased numbers of these cells are associated with poor prognosis invarious cancer patients. The transcription factor NF-κB is considered the master regulator of inflammatory gene expression and immune cell function. Itsactivation in various cells of the tumor microenvironment contributes essentiallyto tumorigenesis. In the present study, the role of canonical NF-κB signaling in myeloid cells in metastatic breast cancer was addressed by myeloid-specificdeletion of Ikkβ in the MMTV polyoma middle T (PyMT) mouse model. Ikkβ deletionin myeloid cells did not affect primary mammary tumor growth but significantlyreduced lung metastasis. While dissemination from the primary tumor wasunaltered, myeloid-specific Ikkβ loss resulted in a strong up-regulation ofpro-inflammatory genes and changes in immune cell populations in the lung,creating a tumor-suppressive microenvironment at the distant site. Thus,canonical NF-κB signaling in myeloid cells creates a permissive lungmicroenvironment that supports breast to lung metastasis.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.24697 PMCID: PMC5908285PMID: 29682184
