The present study proposes to use ensembles ofEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Networks. The search for a high quality ensemble isdirected by a fitness function that incorporates the accuracy of the classifiers both independently and as part of the ensemble itself. The ensemble approach istested on three publicly available biomedical benchmark datasets, one on BreastCancer and two on Parkinson's disease, using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy.Our experimental results show that, for the first dataset, the performance wassimilar to previous studies reported in literature. On the second dataset, theEvolutionary Wavelet Neural Network ensembles performed better than all previous methods. The third dataset is relatively new and this study is the first toreport benchmark results.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0192192 PMCID: PMC5805287PMID: 29420578  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
