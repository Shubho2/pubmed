A second primary in thecontralateral breast can either be synchronous or metachronous. Lobular carcinomaof the breast is known for its multicentricity and bilateral spread. Thesynchronous mixed pattern of carcinoma of the breast has also been reported inthe same breast. The family history of breast carcinoma, estrogen receptornegativity, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positivity are riskfactors for the development of contralateral breast malignancy. In metachronous, bilateral breast cancer (MBBC) usually a single histological variant is seen atdifferent time periods. However, we report a rare case of MBBC in a 66-year-oldfemale patient with positive family history who had infiltrating lobularcarcinoma (ILC) in the left breast followed by infiltrating ductal carcinoma inthe right breast after a span of 2Â½ years, even after undergoing modified radicalmastectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy followed by hormonal therapy for ILC ofleft breast.DOI: 10.4103/ijabmr.IJABMR_384_16 PMCID: PMC5932922PMID: 29744328
