We aimed to describe the presentation and outcomes ofpatients with solid cancers managed at a tertiary hospital in Ghana.METHODS: Records of cancer patients admitted to Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospitalgeneral surgery wards from 2013 to 2016 were reviewed for data on presentation,staging, management, and mortality. Patients discharged alive were followed-up bybiannual telephone calls to establish their postdischarge status. Survivalanalysis was performed for patients with pathologic or radiologic confirmation ofcancer and adequate staging.RESULTS: A total of 343 patients were included. Of these, 76% were female. Themost common diagnoses were breast 136 (40%), foregut 70 (20%), and colorectal 63 (18%) cancers. Cancer diagnosis was confirmed by pathology or radiology in 281(82%) patients, but only 112 (40%) had adequate staging. Seventy-four (66%)patients were stage IV. Two-year overall survival for all 343 patients was 22% to69%, depending on cancer site. Among those with adequate staging who were aliveafter postoperative 90 days, 3-year survival was similar for curative comparedwith palliative operations (P = 0.64).CONCLUSIONS: Improved capacity for both therapeutic and palliative cancer care isneeded to achieve better outcomes by more appropriate allocation of surgery with respect to the goal of treatment.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1002/jso.25168 PMID: 30095201
