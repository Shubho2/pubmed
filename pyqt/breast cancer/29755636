Here, we introduce a novel microfluidic chip for non-invasiveRaman cell natural fingerprint collection. Traditional Raman spectroscopymeasurement of the cells grown in a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) basedmicrofluidic device suffers from the background noise from the substratematerials of PDMS when intended to apply as an in vitro cell assay. To overcomethis disadvantage, the current device is designed with a middle layer of PDMSlayer sandwiched by two MgF2 slides which minimize the PDMS background signal in Raman measurement. Three cancer cell lines, including a human lung cancer cellA549, and human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/BRMS1, werecultured in this microdevice separately for a period of three days to evaluatethe biocompatibility of the microfluidic system. In addition, atomic forcemicroscopy (AFM) was used to measure the Young's modulus and adhesion force ofcancer cells at single cell level. The AFM results indicated that ourmicrochannel environment did not seem to alter the cell biomechanical properties.The biochemical responses of cancer cells exposed to anti-cancer drug doxorubicin(DOX) up to 24â€‰h were assessed by Raman spectroscopy. Principal componentanalysis over the Raman spectra indicated that cancer cells untreated and treatedwith DOX can be distinguished. This PDMS microfluidic device offers anon-invasive and reusable tool for in vitro Raman measurement of living cells,and can be potentially applied for anti-cancer drug screening.DOI: 10.1063/1.5024359 PMCID: PMC5924378 [Available on 2019-04-27]PMID: 29755636
