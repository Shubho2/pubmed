Development of a fast and reliable preparation protocol to enrich such small particles could accelerate the discovery of informative,disease-related biomarkers. Though multiple EV enrichment protocols areavailable, in terms of efficiency, reproducibility and simplicity,precipitation-based methods are most amenable to studies with large numbers ofsubjects. However, the selectivity of the precipitation becomes critical. Here,we present a simple plasma EV enrichment protocol based on pluronic blockcopolymer. The enriched plasma EV was able to be verified by multiple platforms. Our results showed that the particles enriched from plasma by the copolymer were EV size vesicles with membrane structure; proteomic profiling showed thatEV-related proteins were significantly enriched, while high-abundant plasmaproteins were significantly reduced in comparison to other precipitation-basedenrichment methods. Next-generation sequencing confirmed the existence of variousRNA species that have been observed in EVs from previous studies. Small RNAsequencing showed enriched species compared to the corresponding plasma.Moreover, plasma EVs enriched from 20 advanced breast cancer patients and 20age-matched non-cancer controls were profiled by semi-quantitative massspectrometry. Protein features were further screened by EV proteomic profilesgenerated from four breast cancer cell lines, and then selected incross-validation models. A total of 60 protein features that highly contributedin model prediction were identified. Interestingly, a large portion of thesefeatures were associated with breast cancer aggression, metastasis as well asinvasion, consistent with the advanced clinical stage of the patients. Insummary, we have developed a plasma EV enrichment method with improvedprecipitation selectivity and it might be suitable for larger-scale discoverystudies.DOI: 10.1080/20013078.2018.1458574 PMCID: PMC5912199PMID: 29696079
