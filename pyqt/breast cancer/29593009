We testedthe hypothesis that expression of STC1 and STC2 in primary breast tumors is more strongly associated with late versus early recurrences.Methods: A total of 541estrogen receptor-positive, tamoxifen-treated (ER+/TAM+) and 300 ER-negative,tamoxifen-untreated (ER-/TAM-) breast cancer patients who experienced recurrence within 10 years of primary diagnosis and matched recurrence-free controls wereselected from a cohort of 11,251 Danish breast cancer patients diagnosed withstage I, II, or III breast cancer during 1985 to 2001. The association betweenIHC expression of STC1 and STC2 in primary breast tumor tissue microarrays andbreast cancer recurrence was evaluated within median time to recurrencequintiles.Results: The association between STC1 expression, dichotomized aspositive or negative, and recurrence was strongly positive for the final timequintile (6-10 years postdiagnosis) in the ER+/TAM+ group [aOR = 2.70; 95%confidence interval (CI): 1.22-5.98]. Regression of the log ORs relatingdichotomous STC1 and STC2 expression to recurrence by median time to recurrence(year) resulted in a relatively large positive effect estimate for STC1 (β =0.16; 95% CI, -0.03-0.36) and a near-null positive effect estimate for STC2 (β = 0.04; 95% CI, -0.14-0.21).Conclusions: Our results suggest a stronger associationbetween primary tumor STC1 expression and late recurrence, as opposed to earlyrecurrence, although no clear trend was apparent.Impact: STC1 expression in theprimary tumor may potentiate late recurrences, suggesting dormancy pathways that merit further investigation.
