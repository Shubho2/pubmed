Idiopathic non-obstructiveazoospermia (NOA) is defined as the absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate dueto failed spermatogenesis. There is a high probability that NOA is caused by raregenetic defects. In this study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was applied to twoEstonian brothers diagnosed with NOA and Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS).Compound heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants in FANCM (Fanconi anemiacomplementation group M) were detected as the most likely cause for theircondition. A rare maternally inherited frameshift variant p.Gln498Thrfs∗7(rs761250416) and a previously undescribed splicing variant (c.4387-10A>G)derived from the father introduce a premature STOP codon leading to a truncatedprotein. FANCM exhibits enhanced testicular expression. In control subjects,immunohistochemical staining localized FANCM to the Sertoli and spermatogeniccells of seminiferous tubules with increasing intensity through germ celldevelopment. This is consistent with its role in maintaining genomic stability inmeiosis and mitosis. In the individual with SCOS carrying bi-allelic FANCM LoFvariants, none or only faint expression was detected in the Sertoli cells. Asfurther evidence, we detected two additional NOA-affected case subjects withindependent FANCM homozygous nonsense variants, one from Estonia (p.Gln1701∗;rs147021911) and another from Portugal (p.Arg1931∗; rs144567652). The studyconvincingly demonstrates that bi-allelic recessive LoF variants in FANCM causeazoospermia. FANCM pathogenic variants have also been linked with doubled risk offamilial breast and ovarian cancer, providing an example mechanism for theassociation between infertility and cancer risk, supported by published data onFancm mutant mouse models.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics.
