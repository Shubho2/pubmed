Squirrel Road, Rochester, MI, 48309, USA.Acetylation plays an important role in regulating the chaperone activity of Hsp90during malignant transformation through the stabilization and conformationalmaturation of oncogenic proteins. However, the functional acetylation sites,potential anticancer drug targets, are still emerging. We found that acetylation at K292 in Hsp90Î± is critical for the development and treatment of breast cancer.Acetylation at K292 not only augments the affinity of Hsp90 to ATP, co-chaperone and client proteins, it also promotes cancer cell colony formation, migration andinvasion in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, K292 acetylatedHsp90 has been validated as an exciting anti-cancer drug target by interferingthe complex formation between K292 acetylated Hsp90 and co-chaperone Cdc37,leading to diminishment of kinase client maturation and proteasome-dependentdegradation of kinase substrates. Furthermore, we showed that Simvastatinprevented, while LBH589 promoted, the progression of Hsp90 chaperone cycling and client's maturation, resulting in an increment of cell apoptosis by thecombination of Simvastatin and LBH589 in mouse xenograft model. These datasuggest that Simvastatin is a novel Hsp90 inhibitor to disrupt the formation ofK292 acetylated Hsp90/Cdc37 complex in TNBC cells and the combination ofSimvastatin with LBH589 could be used as a novel therapeutic strategy for TNBC.This article is protected by copyright.
