The patient was put on amoxicillin,protected by suspending breast-feeding for several weeks without improvement.Clinical examination showed febrile patient with a temperature of 39°, anincrease in left breast volume, inflammatory signs especially at the level ofinternal quadrants (A). Palpation showed a painful, hot collection adherent tothe skin, measuring 16 cm, at the level of the internal quadrants, invading theexternal quadrants, without axillary adenopathies, suggesting breast abscess.Ultrasound (B) showed voluminous solidocystic predominantly liquid echogenic masswith thick walls and buds up to 46 mm, classified as ACR4. Puncture biopsycollected grayish green liquid, sent for bacteriological examination; antibiotic therapy with quinolones was started. Follow up of patient, after 3 days, showedreduction of the inflammatory signs and bacteriological examination of the liquidfound no germ. After 15 days of antibiotic therapy, the inflammatory signs haddisappeared and the volume of the mass had reduced enough, hence the indicationfor cystectomy. Cystectomy with simple enucleation was performed (C);surprisingly, the histological examination showed cystic fibroadenoma (D).DOI: 10.11604/pamj.2017.28.148.13491 PMCID: PMC5847049PMID: 29541296  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
