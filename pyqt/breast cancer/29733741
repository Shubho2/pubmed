Moreover, MT1-MMP down-regulates these effects. Here, weaddress the effect of type I collagen aging and MT1-MMP expression on cellproliferation suppression and induced-apoptosis in non-invasive MCF-7 and ZR-75-1breast carcinoma. We provide evidence for a decrease in cell growth and anincrease in apoptosis in the presence of adult collagen when compared to oldcollagen. This effect involves a differential activation of DDR1, as evidenced bya higher DDR1 phosphorylation level in adult collagen. In adult collagen,inhibition of DDR1 expression and kinase function induced an increase in cellgrowth to a level similar to that observed in old collagen. The impact of agingon the sensitivity of collagen to MT1-MMP has been reported recently. We used theMT1-MMP expression strategy to verify whether, by degrading adult type Icollagen, it could lead to the same phenotype observed in old collagen 3D matrix.MT1-MMP overexpression abrogated the proliferation suppression andinduced-apoptosis effects only in the presence of adult collagen. This suggeststhat differential collagen degradation by MT1-MMP induced a structuraldisorganization of adult collagen and inhibits DDR1 activation. This could inturn impair DDR1-induced cell growth suppression and apoptosis. Taken together,our data suggest that modifications of collagen structural organization, due toaging, contribute to the loss of the growth suppression and induced apoptosiseffect of collagen in luminal breast carcinoma. MT1-MMP-dependent degradation andaging of collagen have no additive effects on these processes.DOI: 10.1080/19336918.2018.1472182 PMID: 29733741
