Furthermore, if theIVC defect is large, IVC reconstruction with vascular graft after resection isrequired. There are limited reports of cases of IVC reconstruction using a graft.By reviewing data from the literature of previous studies, the present study was aimed at investigating the surgical outcomes of liver resection with IVCresection and reconstruction using an artificial vascular graft. PubMed wassearched for previous articles reporting cases with the combined surgery. Thesearch was limited to articles in English, and cases with exceptional surgeriessuch as in situ cold perfusion, and ante situm and ex vivo techniques wereexcluded from this study. Surgical outcomes of the extracted cases wereinvestigated. Cases dealt only with primary closure after IVC resection, andthose in which the IVC tumor thrombus was treated by opening the IVC wall,removing the thrombus and then closing the IVC without wall excision were notincluded in this study. The literature search identified 13 studies, including111 cases. Operative mortality in the reported cases was 8.1% (9 out of 111cases). Thrombus in the artificial vascular graft was observed in two cases, and patency of the graft during the follow-up period was confirmed in 109 of the 111 cases (98.2%). These results suggested that the surgical outcomes of liverresection combined with IVC resection and reconstruction using the artificialvascular graft were favorable.DOI: 10.1002/ags3.12068 PMCID: PMC5980586PMID: 29863183
