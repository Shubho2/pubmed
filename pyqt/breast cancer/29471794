Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) has been identified as a CSC-associated Wnt-regulated target gene, butits clinical significance in the context of breast cancer remains elusive.Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical significanceof the LGR5-β-catenin axis in breast cancer.METHODS: Breast cancer tissue blocks from 126 patients were used to construct atissue microarray (TMA). Histopathological and clinical data including age; tumorsize; estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermalgrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2) level; tumor grade; lymph node (LN) status; andsurvival were obtained from the cancer registry database and patients' medicalrecords. Tissue on the breast TMA was scored for LGR5 and β-catenin expressionusing semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. We also analyzed LGR5expression in cellular datasets available through ONCOMINE, a web-based cancermicroarray database.RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining revealed that 58 tumors (46%) exhibitedhigh LGR5 expression, whereas 56 tumors (47%) displayed high β-cateninexpression. High levels of LGR5 expression were significantly associated withtumor size (p = 0.002), LN metastasis status (p = 0.044), and triple-negativebreast cancer (p = 0.029), consistent with our findings from the ONCOMINEdatabase. In addition, we also found that β-catenin -expressing breast cancerswere positive correlated with HER2 overexpression. Finally, with respect toclinical outcomes, patients with high levels of LGR5-β-catenin axis expressionexhibited poorer relapse-free survival (RFS) compared to patients with low levelsof LGR5-β-catenin axis expression (p = 0.027).CONCLUSION: LGR5 overexpression was significantly associated with high T stageand LN metastasis status. High LGR5 expression was also associated with reducedRFS, indicating that LGR5 may represent a promising prognostic marker for breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4018-1 PMCID: PMC5824537PMID: 29471794
