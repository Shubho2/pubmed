We have previously shown that PR1is cross-presented by solid tumors, leukemia, and antigen-presenting cells,including B cells. We have also shown that cross-presentation of PR1 by solidtumors renders them susceptible to killing by PR1-targeting immunotherapies. Asmultiple myeloma is derived from B cells, we investigated whether multiplemyeloma is also capable of PR1 cross-presentation and subsequently capable ofbeing targeted by using PR1 immunotherapies.Experimental Design: We testedwhether multiple myeloma is capable of cross-presenting PR1 and subsequentlybecomes susceptible to PR1-targeting immunotherapies, using multiple myeloma celllines, a xenograft mouse model, and primary multiple myeloma patientsamples.Results: Here we show that multiple myeloma cells lack endogenous NE and P3, are able to take up exogenous NE and P3, and cross-present PR1 on HLA-A2.Cross-presentation by multiple myeloma utilizes the conventional antigenprocessing machinery, including the proteasome and Golgi, and is not affected by immunomodulating drugs (IMiD). Following PR1 cross-presentation, we are able totarget multiple myeloma with PR1-CTL and anti-PR1/HLA-A2 antibody both in vitroand in vivoConclusions: Collectively, our data demonstrate that PR1 is a noveltumor-associated antigen target in multiple myeloma and that multiple myeloma is susceptible to immunotherapies that target cross-presented antigens.
