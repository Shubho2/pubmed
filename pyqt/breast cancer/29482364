Despite its clinical efficacy,access to the biological drug can be limited due to its relatively high price,especially in low-income countries. CT-P6 (Herzuma®) is a biosimilar candidate oforiginator or 'reference' trastuzumab, which may offer an alternative, morecost-effective treatment option. This article reviews the unmet needs of patientseligible to receive reference trastuzumab and the potential place of atrastuzumab biosimilar within the market. The review also summarizes theavailable clinical evidence supporting the biosimilarity of CT-P6 and referencetrastuzumab with respect to pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety andimmunogenicity.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-0679 PMID: 29482364
