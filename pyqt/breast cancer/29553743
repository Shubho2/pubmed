Breast cancer isthe most common cancer in women worldwide. In the present study, we examined the effect of salt intake on breast cancer by using a 4T1 mouse mammary tumor model. Unexpectedly, both the fitness and the survival rate of the tumor-bearing micewere improved by high salt intake. Similarly, high salt intake suppressed theprimary tumor growth as well as metastasis to lung in mice. Mechanistically, highsalt intake greatly reduced food intake and thus might exert antitumor effectthrough mimicking calorie restriction. Immunoblotting showed the lowerproliferation marker Ki-67 and the higher expression of the tumor suppressor genep53 in tumors of high salt intake mice. Importantly, high salt intake mightinduce hyperosmotic stress, which sensitized breast cancer cells to p53-dependentanoikis. Collectively, our findings raise the possibility that endogenous saltdeposition might act as the first-line defense system against breast cancerprogression as well as metastasis.DOI: 10.1021/acs.jafc.7b05923 PMID: 29553743  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
