The number of power plant employees and first responders with acute radiation syndrome underfollow-up by the National Research Center for Radiation Medicine decreased from179 in 1986-1991 to 105 in 2011-2015. Cancers and leukemia (19) andcardiovascular diseases (21) were the main causes of deaths among acute radiationsyndrome survivors (54) during the postaccident period. Increased radiation risksof leukemia in the Ukrainian cohort of 110,645 cleanup workers exposed to lowdoses are comparable to those among survivors of the atomic bomb explosions inJapan in 1945. Additionally, an excess of chronic lymphocytic leukemia wasdemonstrated in the cleanup workers cohort for 26 y after the exposure. Asignificant excess of multiple myeloma incidence [standardized incidence rate(SIR) 1.61 %, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-2.21], thyroid cancer (SIR 4.18, 95% CI 3.76-4.59), female breast cancer (SIR 1.57 CI 1.40-1.73), and all cancers combined (SIR 1.07; 95% CI 1.05-1.09) was registered. High prevalence wasdemonstrated for cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases and mental health changes. However, the reasons for the increases require further investigation. To monitor other possible late effects of radiation exposure in Chornobyl cleanup workers,analytical cohort and case-control studies need to include cardiovascularpathology, specifically types of potentially radiogenic cancers using a molecularepidemiology approach. Possible effects for further study include increased ratesof thyroid, breast, and lung cancers and multiple myeloma; reduction of radiationrisks of leukemia to population levels; and increased morbidity and mortality of cleanup workers from cardio- and cerebrovascular pathology.DOI: 10.1097/HP.0000000000000868 PMID: 29787442
