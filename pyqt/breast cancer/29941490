Irrespective of their strong dependence on theproteasome activity, cancer cells, except for multiple myeloma, are mostlyresistant to proteasome inhibitors. A major cause of this resistance is the"proteasome bounce-back response" mediated by NRF1, a transcription factor thatcoordinately activates proteasome subunit genes. To identify new targets forefficient suppression of UPS, we explored using immunoprecipitation and massspectrometry the possible existence of nuclear proteins that co-operate with NRF1and identified O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and Host Cell Factor C1 (HCF-1) as two proteins capable of forming a complex with NRF1. O-GlcNAcylation catalyzed by OGTwas essential for NRF1 stabilization and consequent upregulation of proteasomesubunit genes. Meta-analysis of breast and colorectal cancers revealed positivecorrelations in the relative protein abundance of OGT and proteasome subunits.OGT inhibition was effective at sensitizing cancer cells to a proteasomeinhibitor both in culture cells and a xenograft mouse model. Since activeO-GlcNAcylation is a feature of cancer metabolism, our study has clarified anovel linkage between cancer metabolism and UPS function and added a newregulatory axis to the regulation of the proteasome activity.Copyright Â© 2018 American Society for Microbiology.DOI: 10.1128/MCB.00252-18 PMID: 29941490
