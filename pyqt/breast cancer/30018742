Of these, TP53 is mutated in 25-30% of breast cancers. How TP53 mutations affect theinteraction of TP53 family members and their isoforms in breast cancer isunknown. To investigate this, 3 independent breast cancer cohorts were stratifiedinto 4 groups based on oestrogen receptor (ER) and TP53 mutation status. Usingbioinformatic methodologies, principal signalling pathways associated with theexpression of TP53 family members were identified. Results show an enrichment of IFN-γ signalling associated with TP63 RNA in wild type TP53 (wtTP53), ER negative(ER-) tumours and with Δ133TP53 RNA in mutant TP53 (mTP53) ER positive (ER+)tumours. Moreover, tumours with low IFN-γ signalling were associated withsignificantly poorer patient outcome. The predicted changes in expression of asubset of RNAs involved in IFN-γ signalling were confirmed in vitro. Our datashow that different members of the TP53 family can drive transcription of genesinvolved in IFN-γ signalling in different breast cancer subgroups.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25635 PMCID: PMC6044385PMID: 30018742
