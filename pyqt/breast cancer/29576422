Our previous work in 46 prospectively enrolled breast cancerpatients showed early left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) functiondecline at 1 and 3 months, but only persistent RV dysfunction at 12 months which correlated with myocardial oedema observed early (1 and 3 months) afteradministration of chemotherapy regimes.METHOD: To investigate late cardiac effects, the same cohort were re-imaged with advanced Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging including T1 mapping5 ± 1 year post chemotherapy.RESULTS: Twenty-six out of 46 (50%) patients underwent follow-up imaging. Astatistical but non-clinically significant decrease was observed in LV ejectionfraction (EF) from baseline to 5 years (72.2 ± 6.6 to 65.4 ± 9.3, p < 0.005).Subjects with initial drop of LVEF by >10% at 3 months (n = 5) or at 12 months(n = 3) did not demonstrate any difference in LV or RVEF at 5 years. Nocorrelation was observed between myocardial oedema and LV or RVEF at 5 years. At 5 years, T1 values were within normal limits overall (935 ± 48 ms). One patients had significantly elevated (>1000 ms) T1 values with no correlation to LV orRVEF. No subjects demonstrated replacement myocardial fibrosis at 5 years.CONCLUSION: Using advanced CMR, contemporary chemotherapy regimes demonstrateminimal long-term cardiac toxicity. There is minimal diffuse and no replacementfibrosis as demonstrated by LGE, following chemotherapy. This study suggestslimiting serial imaging in these patients at 12 months post chemotherapy.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.03.025 PMID: 29576422
