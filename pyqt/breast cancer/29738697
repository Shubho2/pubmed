Here, we conducted a meta-analysis toinvestigate the prognostic significance of HDAC1 in breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched different databases to identify studiesevaluating the association between HDAC1 expression and its prognostic value inbreast cancer. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds radios (ORs) with 95%confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from these studies to assessspecific correlation.RESULTS: Our meta-analysis of four databases identified 7 eligible studies with1429 total patients. We found that HDAC1 over-expression did not correlate withdisease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in breast cancer. Subgroup analysis indicated an association between up-regulated HDAC1 expression andbetter OS (HR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23-0.97; P = 0.04) in Asian breast cancerpatients. However, false-positive report probability (FPRP) analysis and trialsequential analysis (TSA) indicated that the results need further validation.Furthermore, HDAC1 over-expression was associated with positive estrogen receptor(ER) expression (OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.11-9.83; P = 0.03) and negative humanepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression (OR, 1.79; 95% CI,1.22-2.61; P = 0.003), but there were no significant differences between patientsbased on age, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, nuclear grade, or progesteronereceptor (PR) expression.CONCLUSION: Overall, our meta-analysis demonstrated an association betweenincreased HDAC1 expression and better OS in Asian breast cancer patients. Inaddition, HDAC1 over-expression correlated with positive ER and negative HER2expression in breast cancer. However, researches in large patients' randomisedcontrolled trials (RCTs) are needed to confirm the results.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
