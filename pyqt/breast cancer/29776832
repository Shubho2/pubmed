Electronic address:b.denny@auckland.ac.nz.The proteins Orai1 and STIM1 control store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) into cells.SOCE is important for migration, invasion and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 humantriple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and has been proposed as a target for cancer drug discovery. Two hit compounds from a medium throughput screen,displayed encouraging inhibition of SOCE in MDA-MB-231 cells, as measured by aFluorescence Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) Ca2+ assay. Following NMR spectroscopicanalysis of these hits and reassignment of their structures as5-hydroxy-5-trifluoromethylpyrazolines, a series of analogues was prepared viathermal condensation reactions between substituted acylhydrazones andtrifluoromethyl 1,3-dicarbonyl arenes. Structure-activity relationship (SAR)studies showed that small lipophilic substituents at the 2- and 3-positions ofthe RHS and 2-, 3- and 4-postions of the LHS terminal benzene rings improvedactivity, resulting in a novel class of potent and selective inhibitors of SOCE.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
