The purpose of the present study was to examine the mediating role of breast conflict in cognitive factors, as suggested by the Health Belief Model (HBM), for adopting mammography.METHOD: In this explanatory cross-sectional study, multistage cluster samplingwas employed to recruit 738 women in the age range of 40 to 69Â years in Iran.Champion's revised HBM Scale for mammography adoption and the Women's BreastConflict Scale were used to measure the variables of interest. Generalizedstructural equation modeling and hierarchical logistic regression were used fordata analysis.RESULTS: Breast conflict was negatively associated with perceived barriers ofmammography. Perceived barriers were inversely related to self-efficacy, andself-efficacy was positively related to mammography, suggesting the mediatingrole of perceived barriers and self-efficacy, connecting breast conflict tomammography indirectly.CONCLUSIONS: The mediating role of breast conflict in perceived barriers andself-efficacy suggests an indirect link between breast conflict and mammography. Clinicians and public health care providers must pay attention to women'sfeelings in formulating and delivering appropriate interventions andconsultations.DOI: 10.1080/03630242.2018.1500414 PMID: 30040607
