The aim ofthis study was to assess whether weekly low-dose bevacizumab-based regimens were well tolerated and would improve efficacy in MBC patients who had failed numeroustherapies.METHODS: Seventeen patients with MBC who were heavily pretreated with a median offive regimens of therapy (range 1-10) between 2012 and 2016 were included in the analysis. Bevacizumab was administered at a dose of 100 mg intravenously once aweek combined with one or two types of chemotherapeutic drugs until confirmeddisease progression or an intolerable adverse event was observed. Patientcharacteristics, objective response rate, clinical benefit rate, progression-freesurvival, and toxicity were assessed.RESULTS: All 17 patients had been pretreated with taxane-based andanthracycline-based chemotherapy. Weekly low-dose bevacizumab combined with oneor two types of chemotherapeutic drugs, which had usually not been previouslyused (e.g. etoposide, irinotecan, pemetrexed, methotrexate, and nab-paclitaxel), was administered. Three patients achieved a partial response, while one hadstable disease for > 24 weeks, and the clinical benefit rate was 23.5%. Medianprogression-free survival was 3.4 months (95% confidence interval 2.0-4.8). Themost common hematological adverse events were neutropenia, anemia, andthrombocytopenia. Bevacizumab-related adverse events included grade 1 bleeding(17.6%) and grade 2 hypertension (5.9%).CONCLUSIONS: Weekly low-dose bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy shows arelatively favorable clinical response and tolerable toxicity, providing afeasible option for heavily pretreated MBC patients.© 2018 The Authors.
