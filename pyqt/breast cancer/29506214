We will prospectively evaluate thepredictive performance of HSD17B4 hypermethylation in patients withHER2-positive/HR-negative breast cancer treated with sequentialchemo-radiotherapy. The primary endpoint is the rate of pathological completeresponse, defined as the absence of invasive and intraductal tumor cells in thebreast at surgery, in breast cancer with HSD17B4 hypermethylation. If the pCRrates are extremely high, the ultimate breast-conserving treatment excluding the need for surgery could be a future treatment option. A total of 200 patients willbe enrolled.
