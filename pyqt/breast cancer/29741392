We aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin D levelson the prognosis of resectable breast cancer in a patient group with highlydifferent clothing styles.PATIENTS & METHODS: A total of 186 breast cancer patients were enrolled in thestudy.RESULTS: Vitamin D level was sufficient, insufficient and deficient in 17.2, 52.2and 30.6% of patients, respectively. There was a significant relationship betweenclothing style and serum 25 (OH) D levels. We could not establish any relationbetween vitamin D level and tumor characteristics or survival.CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation can be more important than diagnostic serumvitamin D level on prognosis of breast cancer.DOI: 10.2217/fon-2017-0608 PMID: 29741392
