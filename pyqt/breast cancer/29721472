The use of geneexpression assays for early stage disease is already common practice. These testshave found a place in risk stratifying the heterogeneous group of stage I-IIbreast cancers for recurrence, for predicting chemotherapy response, and forpredicting breast cancer-related mortality. Most guidelines for hormone receptor (HR)-positive early breast cancer recommend addition of adjuvant chemotherapy formost women, leading to overtreatment, which causes considerable morbidity andcost. Expert oncologist discussed about strategies of gene expression assays and aid in chemotherapy recommendations for treatment of HR + ve EBC and the expertgroup used data from published literature, practical experience and opinion of a large group of academic oncologists to arrive at this practical consensusrecommendations for the benefit of community oncologists.DOI: 10.4103/sajc.sajc_110_18 PMCID: PMC5909304PMID: 29721472
