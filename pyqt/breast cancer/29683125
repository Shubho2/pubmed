Patients were tested usingthe Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer, Mini-Cog,Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Brief Fatigue Inventory, Geriatric Depression Scale,and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Pearson correlation coefficients and logisticregression models were used.RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 78 years. Pain and fatigue, depressionand pain, and depression and fatigue each were positively related, and gripstrength and TUG scores were negatively related. Fatigue was the strongestpredictor of poor sleep.IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: These findings are important to the comprehensive care of older women diagnosed with breast cancer. Understanding symptoms associatedwith poor sleep helps nurses develop comprehensive care plans for older adultswith breast cancer.DOI: 10.1188/18.ONF.359-371 PMID: 29683125
