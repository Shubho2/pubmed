Current Institute of Medicine (IOM) vitamin D guidance is based solelyon bone health.Methods: We pooled participant-level data from 17 cohorts, comprising 5706colorectal cancer case participants and 7107 control participants with a widerange of circulating 25(OH)D concentrations. For 30.1% of participants, 25(OH)Dwas newly measured. Previously measured 25(OH)D was calibrated to the same assay to permit estimating risk by absolute concentrations. Study-specific relativerisks (RRs) for prediagnostic season-standardized 25(OH)D concentrations werecalculated using conditional logistic regression and pooled using random effects models.Results: Compared with the lower range of sufficiency for bone health (50-<62.5nmol/L), deficient 25(OH)D (<30 nmol/L) was associated with 31% higher colorectalcancer risk (RR = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05 to 1.62); 25(OH)Dabove sufficiency (75-<87.5 and 87.5-<100 nmol/L) was associated with 19% (RR =0.81, 95% CI = 0.67 to 0.99) and 27% (RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.59 to 0.91) lowerrisk, respectively. At 25(OH)D of 100 nmol/L or greater, risk did not continue todecline and was not statistically significantly reduced (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.67to 1.24, 3.5% of control participants). Associations were minimally affected whenadjusting for body mass index, physical activity, or other risk factors. For each25 nmol/L increment in circulating 25(OH)D, colorectal cancer risk was 19% lower in women (RR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.75 to 0.87) and 7% lower in men (RR = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.86 to 1.00) (two-sided Pheterogeneity by sex = .008). Associations wereinverse in all subgroups, including colorectal subsite, geographic region, andseason of blood collection.Conclusions: Higher circulating 25(OH)D was related to a statisticallysignificant, substantially lower colorectal cancer risk in women andnon-statistically significant lower risk in men. Optimal 25(OH)D concentrationsfor colorectal cancer risk reduction, 75-100 nmol/L, appear higher than currentIOM recommendations.DOI: 10.1093/jnci/djy087 PMID: 29912394
