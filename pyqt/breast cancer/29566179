[Epub ahead of print]Breast cancer brain metastasis: molecular mechanisms and directions fortreatment.Pedrosa R(1), Mustafa DA(1), Soffietti R(2), Kros JM(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Erasmus medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.(2)Department of Neuro-Oncology, University of Turin and City of Health andScience Hospital, Turin, Italy.The development of brain metastasis (BM) of breast cancer is usually a late eventwith deleterious effect on the prognosis. Treatment options for intracerebralseeding of breast cancer are limited and so far, non-specific. Moleculardetailing of subsequent events of penetration, seeding and outgrowth in brain is highly relevant for developing therapeutic strategies to treat, or prevent, BM.Wescrutinize recent literature for molecules and pathways that are operative in theformation of breast cancer BM. We also summarize current data on therapeuticefforts to specifically address BM of breast cancer. Data on molecular pathwaysunderlying the formation of BM of breast cancer are sketchy and to some extentinconsistent. The molecular make-up of BM differs from that of the primarytumors, and also from metastases at other sites. Current efforts to treat breast cancer BM are limited and drugs used have proven effects on the primary tumorsbut lack specificity for the intracerebral tumors.More basic research isnecessary to better characterize BM of breast cancer. Apart from theidentification of drug targets defined by the intracerebral tumors, also targets in the molecular pathways involved in passing the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) andintracerebral tumor cell (TC) growth should be revealed.DOI: 10.1093/neuonc/noy044 PMID: 29566179
