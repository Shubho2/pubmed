The use of deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap in autologousreconstruction is a popular approach. There were some reports about abdominalcomplications after breast reconstruction. However, there was no report aboutspontaneous rupture of abdominal wall.CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old female patient was diagnosed with left breastcancer. Left mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed, and thebreast was reconstructed using DIEP flap simultaneously. She suffered heavyabdominal pain and vomiting at postoperative day 4. Computed tomography showedbowel herniation into the subcutaneous tissue caused by left abdominal wallrupture. The abdominal wall was sutured and repaired using mesh by emergencysurgery.CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case aboutspontaneous rupture of abdominal wall after breast reconstruction using DIEP flapto be reported in the English literature. DIEP flap on breast reconstructivesurgery may cause spontaneous rupture of abdominal wall.DOI: 10.1186/s40792-018-0491-7 PMID: 30066205
