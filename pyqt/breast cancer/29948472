We aimed to examine prevalence and determinants of changes in work status, and the effect of these changes on quality of life of breast cancer survivors.Methods A cross-sectional study of 410 female breast cancer survivors randomlydrawn from a larger study sample pool (n = 2644), members of "Leumit" healthcare fund, who were diagnosed with primary nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer in theyears 2002-2012. The study questionnaire included questions on workcharacteristics and health-related quality-of-life and was completed by all womencontacted. Work transition was defined as a downgrade (from full-time topart-time), termination, or retirement, and was contrasted to no change in workstatus (retention of full-time or part-time). Work transition was assessed at twointervals: between breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, and between breastcancer diagnosis and time of the survey. Results A total of 206 breast cancersurvivors (50%) were employed prior to their diagnosis, of whom 12% stoppedworking, and 79% downgraded to part-time during treatment. At the time of survey (mean 8 ± 3 years post-diagnosis), 33% of those employed prior to their diagnosisstopped working or retired, 48% downgraded to part-time, and 19% had no change intheir work situation. Work transition between diagnosis and time of the surveywas significantly associated with poorer quality-of-life. In multivariableanalyses, work transition between diagnosis and time of the survey was positivelyassociated with being immigrant compared to native-born Israeli (odds ratio (OR) 4.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.91-11.37; P = .001), and inversely witheducation level of college or over compared to high school or less (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.09-0.86; P = .026). Conclusions Breast cancer survivors with characteristicspointing at underprivileged social circumstances more often experienced changesin work status after surviving breast cancer, irrespective of diagnosis,comorbidity or treatment. Breast cancer patients with immigrant status and/orlower educational attainment need more support to be able to keep their job.DOI: 10.1007/s10926-018-9789-3 PMID: 29948472
