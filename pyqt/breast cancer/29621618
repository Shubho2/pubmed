Electronic address:bmesurolle@yahoo.fr.OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefit of stereoscopic digital mammography in dailypractice.METHODS: Stereoscopic digital (SD) mammography allows a fused 3D view ofmammogram. A 4-degree cranio-caudal (CC) angle view matched with a regular CCview allows generating a stereoscopic view. Three breast radiologists reviewedretrospectively 1110 stereoscopic digital mammograms (1075 women) performedbetween November 2011 and February 2013 with the following sequence: eachevaluated firstly conventional mammogram alone, and then integrated SDmammograms. The benefit was quoted in 3-grade scale: 0 for no benefit, 1 moderateand 2 excellent. The concordance between radiologists was evaluated by the WRandall coefficient. Subgroup analysis according to the BI-RADS classification,breast density and type of abnormalities were performed by calculatingodds-ratio.RESULTS: The readers had the same opinion regarding the value of stereoscopicdigital mammograms in 87% of cases (962/1110). Benefit was null, moderate andexcellent in 8, 52 and 26% respectively. The concordance of radiologists wasexcellent with a W coefficient above 0.89.CONCLUSIONS: SD mammogram improved interpretation of abnormal mammograms. Thispotentially interesting and promising complementary tool might be beneficial indaily breast imaging practice.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
