SHP2 (PTPN11) is required for RAS/ERK pathway activation by most RTKs, and mightprovide a common resistance node. We found that combining the SHP2 inhibitorSHP099 with a MEK-I inhibited the proliferation of multiple cancer cell lines in vitro. PTPN11 knockdown/MEK-I treatment had similar effects, while expressingSHP099 binding-defective PTPN11 mutants conferred resistance, demonstrating that SHP099 is on-target. SHP099/trametinib was highly efficacious in xenograft and/orgenetically engineered models of KRAS-mutant pancreas, lung, and ovarian cancerand in wild type RAS-expressing triple negative breast cancer. SHP099 inhibitedactivation of KRAS mutants with residual GTPase activity, impededSOS/RAS/MEK/ERK1/2 reactivation in response to MEK-Is and blockedERK1/2-dependent transcriptional programs. We conclude that SHP099/MEK-Icombinations could have therapeutic utility in multiple malignancies.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-0444 PMID: 30045908
