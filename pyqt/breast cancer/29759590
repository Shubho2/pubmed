Demographics of participants andnon-participants were compared. All invitees were asked to report reasons for(non)participation. Ethical approval was obtained. Participants provided written informed consent.RESULTS: Of the 8,061 invitees, 66% answered that they were interested, and 59%eventually participated. Participants were on average 54-years old (interquartilerange: 51-59 years), comparable to women with extremely dense breasts in thepopulation-based screening programme (55 years). Women with higher socio-economicstatus (SES) were more often interested in participation than women with lowerSES (68% versus 59%, p<0.001). The most frequently stated reasons fornon-participation were "MRI-related inconveniences and/or self-reportedcontraindications to MRI" (27%) and "anxiety regarding the result of supplementalscreening" (21%). "Expected personal health benefit" (68%) and "contribution toscience" (43%) were the most frequent reasons for participation.CONCLUSION: Of women invited for MRI because of extremely dense breasts, 59%participated. Common reasons for non-participation were "MRI-relatedinconveniences" and "anxiety regarding the result of supplemental screening". In case of future implementation, availability of precise evidence on benefits andharms might reduce this anxiety.Copyright Â© 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists.
