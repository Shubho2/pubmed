Materials and Methods In thisretrospective study, a discovery cohort (n = 60) and a multicenter validationcohort (n = 186) were analyzed. Each tumor was divided into multiple spatiallysegregated, phenotypically consistent subregions on the basis of perfusion MRimaging parameters. The authors first defined a multiregional spatial interaction(MSI) matrix and then, based on this matrix, calculated 22 image features. Anetwork strategy was used to integrate all image features and classify patientsinto different risk groups. The prognostic value of imaging-based stratification was evaluated in relation to clinical-pathologic factors with multivariable Coxregression. Results Three intratumoral subregions with high, intermediate, andlow MR perfusion were identified and showed high consistency between the twocohorts. Patients in both cohorts were stratified according to network analysisof multiregional image features regarding RFS (log-rank test, P = .002 for both).Aggressive tumors were associated with a larger volume of the poorly perfusedsubregion as well as interaction between poorly and moderately perfusedsubregions and surrounding parenchyma. At multivariable analysis, the proposedMSI-based marker was independently associated with RFS (hazard ratio: 3.42; 95%confidence interval: 1.55, 7.57; P = .002) adjusting for age, estrogen receptor(ER) status, progesterone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptortype 2 (HER2) status, tumor volume, and pathologic complete response (pCR).Furthermore, imaging helped stratify patients for RFS within the ER-positive and HER2-positive subgroups (log-rank test, P = .007 and .004) and among patientswithout pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (log-rank test, P = .003). Conclusion Breast cancer consists of multiple spatially distinct subregions. Imagingheterogeneity is an independent prognostic factor beyond traditional riskpredictors.Â© RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018172462 PMCID: PMC6029132 [Available on 2019-07-01]PMID: 29714680  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
