Minimising hair loss may improve mood and body image. Our aim was to determine scalp cooling (SC) efficacy in EBCpatients receiving contemporary chemotherapy regimen, to inform future patientschoice to use SC or not.METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective cohort study of 60 stage 1-3 EBC patientsrecommended to receive taxane or anthracycline-taxane chemotherapy regimens. The primary outcome was incidence of minimal hair-loss (MHL - defined as 60% Deangrade 1 or 2). Patients were categorised by chemotherapy (3 groups) andrandomised 1:1 within each group to two scalp cooling temperature settings using the Dignitana Dignicap machine (secondary endpoint). Patients reported degree of hair loss using the Dean score on day 1 of each cycle and following the lastchemotherapy.RESULTS: On an intention-to-treat basis, 33% of patients reported MHL, thus ourprimary endpoint was not achieved. Patients receiving taxane-only chemotherapyhad the highest rate of MHL (45%). No other factors (including hair type, age,body weight, temperature setting) predicted for MHL. Patient-reported anxietyreduced significantly in all patients, but no difference was observed fordepression or body image irrespective of degree of hair loss. SC-related adverse events were uniformly of low grade and all resolved. We would recommend the useof SC for all patients receiving taxane-based chemotherapy, with its use forthose patients recommended for anthracycline-taxane regimens being made on anindividual basis.
