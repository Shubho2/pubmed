[Epub ahead of print]Overexpression of miR-361-5p in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) inhibitsmigration and invasion by targeting RQCD1 and inhibiting the EGFR/ PI3K/Aktpathway.Han J(1), Yu J, Dai Y, Li J, Guo M, Song J, Zhou X.Author information: (1)Breast Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Engineering,Handan, Hebei, China. dr_hanjianjun@163.com.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deathin women. Previous studies indicated that miR-361-5p was downregulated in breast cancer, however, the exact effect of miR-361-5p on TNBC requires furtherinvestigation. In the present study, we investigated whether miR-361-5p can actas a tumor suppressor by targeting required for cell differentiation 1 homolog(RQCD1) and inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway in TNBC. The expression ofmiR-361-5p and RQCD1 was determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR(qRT-PCR) and/or western blot in TNBC and the adjacent tissues. miR-361-5p mimicswere constructed and transfected to TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Expression ofmiR-361-5p and mRNA and protein expression of RQCD1, PI3K, Akt, EGFR and matrixmetallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) in MDA-MB-231 were measured by qRT-PCR and/or western blot after transfection. Cell viability was determined by CCK-8 assay. Cellmigration and invasion ability were evaluated by scratch and transwell assayrespectively. Confirmation of miR-361-5p target was determined by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. Downregulated miR-361-5p and upregulated RQCD1 were observed in tumor tissues. Expression of EGFR, PI3K, Akt and MMP-9 wasinhibited in cells treated with miR-361-5p mimics. Transfection of miR-361-5pmimics also inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR, PI3K, and Akt. Suppressed cellviability, migration, and invasion was found in miR-361-5p mimics groups.Luciferase reporter assay showed that RQCD1 was the target of miR-361-5p. Theseresults indicated that overexpression of miR-361-5p might act as a suppressor in TNBC by targeting RQCD1 to inhibit the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.DOI: 10.17305/bjbms.2018.3399 PMID: 29924958
