Electronic address: bxu@southernresearch.org.We report here the rational design and validation of a peptide inhibitor to thePD-1/PD-L1 interaction as an attempt to develop a viable alternative to currentinhibitory antibodies. We demonstrated, by biolayer interferometry and in silico docking simulations, that a PD-L1 peptide mimetic (PL120131) can interfere withthe PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by binding to PD-1. We show that PL120131 is capableof inhibiting PD-1 mediated apoptotic signaling pathway and rescuing Jurkat cellsand primary lymphocytes from apoptosis. Additionally, we show that PL120131treatment allows for CTL anti-tumor activity. Furthermore, PL120131 can maintain co-culture survivability and activity of T Cells in a 3D co-culture model better than the anti-PD-1 blocking antibody. Together, the characterization of thisPD-1/PD-L1 inhibiting peptide provides insight regarding the ability to inhibitPD-L1 binding while maintaining CTL viability and activity that can further thedevelopment of alternatives to antibody based immunotherapies.Copyright Â© 2018.
