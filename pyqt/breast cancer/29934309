KLK-related peptidase 6 (KLK6),specifically, is highly up-regulated in several types of cancer, where itsincreased activity promotes cancer invasion and metastasis. This characteristicsuggests KLK6 as an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. However,inhibitors that specifically target KLK6 have not yet been reported, possiblybecause KLK6 shares a high sequence homology and structural similarity with otherserine proteases and resists inhibition by many polypeptide inhibitors. Here, we present an innovative combinatorial approach to engineering KLK6 inhibitors viaflow cytometry-based screening of a yeast-displayed mutant library of the humanamyloid precursor protein Kunitz protease inhibitor domain (APPI), an inhibitorof other serine proteases, such as anionic and cationic trypsins. On the basis ofthis screening, we generated APPIM17L,I18F,S19F,F34V (APPI-4M), an APPI variantwith a KLK6 inhibition constant (Ki) of 160 pM and a turnover time of 10 days. Tothe best of our knowledge, APPI-4M is the most potent KLK6 inhibitor reported to date, displaying 146-fold improved affinity and 13-fold improved proteolyticstability compared with wild-type APPI (APPIWT). We further demonstrate thatAPPI-4M acts as a functional inhibitor in a cell-based model of KLK6-dependentbreast cancer invasion. Finally, the crystal structures of the APPIWT/KLK6 andAPPI-4M/KLK6 complexes revealed the structural and mechanistic bases for theimproved KLK6 binding and proteolytic resistance of APPI-4M. We anticipate thatAPPI-4M will have substantial translational potential as both imaging agent andtherapeutic.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and MolecularBiology, Inc.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.000871 PMID: 29934309
