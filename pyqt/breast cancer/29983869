NAC1 knock-down was previously shown to result in the apoptosis ofovarian cancer cell lines and to rescue their sensitivity to chemotherapy,suggesting that NAC1 may be a potential therapeutic target, but protein complexformation of intranuclear NAC1 in ovarian cancer cells remain poorly understood. In this study, analysis of ovarian cancer cell lysates by fast protein liquidchromatography on a sizing column showed that the NAC1 peak corresponded to anapparent molecular mass of 300-500 kDa, which is larger than the estimatedmolecular mass (58 kDa) of the protein. Liquid chromatography-tandem massspectrometry analysis identified CARM1 as interacting with NAC1 in the proteincomplex. Furthermore, tissue microarray analysis revealed a significantcorrelation between CARM1 and NAC1 expression levels. Ovarian cancer patientsexpressing high levels of NAC1 and CARM1 exhibited poor prognosis after adjuvant chemotherapy. Collectively, our results demonstrate that high expression levelsof NAC1 and its novel binding partner CARM1 may serve as an informativeprognostic biomarker for predicting resistance to chemotherapy for ovariancancer.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25400 PMCID: PMC6033357PMID: 29983869
