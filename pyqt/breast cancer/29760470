GermlineCNVs are known to confer disease susceptibility, but their role in breast cancer warrants further investigations. We hypothesized that breast cancer associatedgermline CNVs contribute to disease risk through gene dosage or otherpost-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, possibly through tissue specificexpression of CNV-embedded small-noncoding RNAs (CNV-sncRNAs). Our objectives areto identify breast cancer associated CNVs using a genome wide association study(GWAS), identify sncRNA genes embedded within CNVs, confirm breast tissue (tumor and normal) expression of the sncRNAs, correlate their expression with germlinecopy status and identify pathways influenced by the genes regulated by sncRNAs.We used an association study design and accessed germline CNV data generated onAffymetrix Human SNP 6.0 array in 686 (in-house data) and 495 (TCGA data)subjects served as discovery and validation cohorts. We identified 1812 breastcancer associated CNVs harboring miRNAs (n = 38), piRNAs (n = 9865), snoRNAs(n = 71) and tRNAs (n = 12) genes. A subset of CNV-sncRNAs expressed in breasttissue, also showed correlation with germline copy status. We identified targets potentially regulated by miRNAs and snoRNAs. In summary, we demonstrate thepotential impact of embedded CNV-sncRNAs on expression and regulation ofdown-stream targets.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-25801-1 PMCID: PMC5951800PMID: 29760470
