The present study wasconducted with the objectives to estimate prevalence of various survivorshipissues, and to identify those which are most predictive of limitations in QOLafter completion of primary therapy.MATERIAL &METHODS: This study was conducted in 230 breast cancer survivors (BCs) and 112 controls at an academic centre in Northern India. Assessment of QOL wasdone by SF-36 and FACT-B questionnaires. Survivorship issues were noted from achecklist of 14 commonly reported symptoms. Main outcome measures were (1)frequencies of survivorship issues and QOL scores among three groups of survivorsdivided on the basis of time elapsed since treatment (<2, 2-5, and >5 year followup) (2) Issues most predictive of limitations in QOL, identified by stepwiselogistic regression analysis.RESULTS: Longer term BCs showed higher QOL scores as compared to those in earlyfollow up. However their QOL scores remained poorer compared to healthy women.The most prevalent survivorship issues were fatigue (60%), restriction ofshoulder movement (59.6%), body and joint pain (63.5%), chemotherapy inducedcessation of menstruation (73.3%) and loss of sexual desire (60%). Issues whichhad maximum impact on QOL scores were emotional distress (r = -11.375), fatigue(r = -9.27) and premature menopause (r = -2.085) and its related symptoms.CONCLUSION: Management of these issues should be priority areas for supportivecare, especially in settings with limited resource.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
