By analyzing gene-acrylamide interactions for ER+ breast cancerrisk, we aimed to clarify the role of acrylamide intake in ER+ breast canceretiology.METHODS: The prospective Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer includes62,573 women, aged 55-69 years. At baseline, a random subcohort of 2589 women wassampled from the total cohort for a case-cohort analysis approach. Dietaryacrylamide intake of subcohort members (n = 1449) and ER+ breast cancer cases(n = 844) was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire. We genotyped singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes in acrylamide metabolism, sex steroidsystems, oxidative stress and DNA repair. Multiplicative interaction betweenacrylamide intake and SNPs was assessed with Cox proportional hazards analysis,based on 20.3 years of follow-up.RESULTS: Unexpectedly, there was a statistically non-significant inverseassociation between acrylamide and ER+ breast cancer risk among all women butwith no clear dose-response relationship, and no association among never smokers.Among the results for 57 SNPs and 2 gene deletions, rs1056827 in CYP1B1,rs2959008 and rs7173655 in CYP11A1, the GSTT1 gene deletion, and rs1052133 inhOGG1 showed a statistically significant interaction with acrylamide intake forER+ breast cancer risk.CONCLUSIONS: This study did not provide evidence for a positive associationbetween acrylamide intake and ER+ breast cancer risk. If anything, acrylamide wasassociated with a decreased ER+ breast cancer risk. The interaction with SNPs in CYP1B1 and CYP11A1 suggests that acrylamide may influence ER+ breast cancer risk through sex hormone pathways.DOI: 10.1007/s00394-018-1619-z PMID: 29445914
