Centchroman(CC), an oral contraceptive has been found to exhibit anti-cancer potentialagainst a wide range of cancer including breast cancer.PURPOSE: The present study is intended to evaluate the ability of soy isoflavone Daidzein (DZ) in enhancing the efficacy of CC in Human Breast Cancer Cells(HBCCs).METHODS/STUDY DESIGN: Sulforhodamine B assay was employed to determine thecytotoxicity induced by 10 µM CC & 50 µM DZ separately and together in MCF-7/MDA MB-231 HBCCs and non-tumorigenic Human Mammary Epithelial Cells (HMECs) MCF-10Aas a control. Combination Index (CI) analysis was executed using CompuSynsoftware. Further, apoptosis was assessed using Annexin V/PI, AO/PI staining and tunel assay. Cell cycle, reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrialmembrane potential alteration was determined using flow cytometry. Western blotanalysis was performed to check the expression of respective proteins.RESULTS: The results suggest that the combination exerts elevated toxicity ascompared to control and each drug per se without affecting HMECs MCF-10A. Thistherefore implies cancer cell specific action of CC plus DZ administeredtogether. Additionally, combination index analysis suggests synergistic action ofCC and DZ combination in HBCCs. Cell cycle analysis, Annexin V/PI staining, tunelassay and western blot analysis confirms the induction of apoptosis bycombination in HBCCs. Interestingly, western blot analysis also revealed that thecombination down-regulated the expression of proteins involved in cell survivali.e. PI3K, Akt and mTOR, suggesting inhibition of cell survival pathway.CONCLUSION: The results overall demonstrate that CC plus DZ has higher anticancerefficacy as compared to either drug alone. Hence, the combination of CC plus DZmay offer a novel strategy for the management of breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
