Theestimated 5-year overall survival (OS) for patients with distant metastaticdisease is approximately 3%. New treatment options are an unmet need and remainan area of active investigation. A 53-year-old male with metastatic pancreaticcancer presented to the hospital with acute-on-chronic respiratory failureapproximately 24 hours after receiving a novel therapeutic combination. Chestimaging showed marked changes as concerning for pneumonitis. Infectious workupwas negative. The patient had initial clinical improvement after receivinginitial intravenous steroids and oxygen support but eventually deteriorated lateropting for supportive measures only. With infection ruled out, drug-inducedpneumonitis was felt to be the likely cause of the radiologic and clinicalchanges. The rapidity of onset of symptoms is the aspect being highlighted inthis case.DOI: 10.1155/2018/6314392 PMCID: PMC5902098PMID: 29808141
