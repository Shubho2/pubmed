We retrospectively investigated treatment outcomes according to the treatment lines and assessed adverse events.RESULTS: Nine patients were eligible. The median age was 67 years (range 42-81), and 6 patients (66.7%) were male. Four patients (50%) received pazopanib assecond-line treatment. According to the RECIST and Choi criteria, the respective response rates were 0 and 50%, while the respective disease control rates were88.9 and 75%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.2 months (95%confidence interval 3.2-8.8). Treatment line and high frequency of mitosis werenot predictive of PFS (p = 0.67, 0.92). Two patients (22.2%) experienced elevatedliver enzymes of grade 3 or higher.CONCLUSION: Pazopanib is an effective treatment option for recurrent ormetastatic SFT in first- and second-line settings. Liver injury is a majoradverse event and adequate treatment withdrawal and dose reduction should beconsidered when necessary.Â© 2018 S.
