To increase the response to therapy,different adjuvant systems are tested, like the case of deuterium-depleted water (DDW).METHODS: For this study, we selected as in vitro model the triple-negative breastcancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and we performed a series of microscopy-basedfunctional tests (apoptosis, autophagy assays, senescence detection) andmicroarray evaluation of the miRNA profile in order to evaluate changes inducedby cisplatin and DDW treatment at cellular and molecular level.RESULTS: Cisplatin treatment led to increased mitochondrial activity andautophagy for cells kept in DDW, compared with those in standard conditions (SC).We also observed that cells treated with DDW medium promoted senescence in ahigher level than SC. The exosomal miRNAs released in cell culture revealed analtered pattern in the case of cells maintained in DDW compared to SC.CONCLUSION: DDW was proved to be non-toxic, and, when administered withcisplatin, to slightly increase the senescence of cancer cells, therefore, can bepondered as adjuvant therapeutic agent. However, future studies are needed to be done in order to further elucidate its mechanism of action.PMID: 30003739
