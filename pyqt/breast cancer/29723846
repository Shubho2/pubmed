Acombination of direct and indirect comparisons was performed using an NMA toevaluate the combined odd ratios (OR) and draw the surface under the cumulativeranking curves (SUCRA) of the diagnostic value of different imaging methods forBC.RESULTS: A total of 39 eligible diagnostic tests regarding 19 imaging methods(mammography [MG], breast-specific gamma imaging [BSGI], color Doppler sonography[CD], contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging [CE-MRI], digital breasttomosynthesis [DBT], fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computedtomography [FDG PET/CT], fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography[FDG-PET], full field digital mammography [FFDM], handheld breast ultrasound[HHUS], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], automated breast volume scanner [ABUS],magnetic resonance mammography [MRM], scintimammography [SMM], single photonemission computed tomography scintimammography [SPECT SMM], ultrasoundelastography [UE], ultrasonography [US], mammography + ultrasonography [MG + US],mammography + scintimammography [MG + SMM], and ultrasound elastography +ultrasonography [UE + US]) were included in the study. According to this network meta-analysis, in comparison to the MG method, the CE-MRI, MRI, MRM, MG + SMM andUE + US methods exhibited relatively higher sensitivity, and the specificity ofthe FDG PET/CT method was higher, while the BSGI and MRI methods exhibited higheraccuracy.CONCLUSION: The results from this NMA indicate that the diagnostic value of theBSGI, MG + SMM, MRI and CE-MRI methods for BC were relatively higher in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.Â© 2018 The Author(s).
