So far, PI3K(Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase) inhibitors have been believed tobe effective drugs until frequent resistance emerged. Recently, PI3K H1047Rmutation has been reported to sensitize breast cancer cells to PI3K inhibition byaspirin. Considering aspirin activates AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)simultaneously, it is possible that AMPK activators and PI3K inhibitors cansynergistically inhibit breast cancers. Here we clearly observed synergisticsuppression of cell growth in all three breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7,MDA-MB-361 and HCC38) when co-treating cells with PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 andAMPK activator AICAR (5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide). What ismore, it is rather remarkable that the synergistic effect was much more dramatic in PIK3CA (PI3K catalytic subunit alpha) mutated (E545K) cells (MCF-7 andMDA-MB-361) than in PIK3CA wild-type cells (HCC38), which implied there is arelationship between PI3K genetic status and the efficacy of combination therapy.By using PIK3CA wild-type isogenic MCF-7 cell line, which exhibited attenuatedcell proliferation compared with the parental MCF-7 cell line, we foundendogenous reverse mutation of PIK3CA E545K alleles to wild-type sequence inMCF-7 cells dramatically impaired the synergy of PI3Ki&AMPKa (combinatorial PI3K inhibition and AMPK activation). Furthermore, PI3Ki&AMPKa significantlyattenuated tumorigenesis of parental MCF-7 cells but not PIK3CA wild-typeisogenic MCF-7 cells in tumor xenograft models. Taken together, our resultssuggest a promising precision therapy of PI3Ki&AMPKa in PIK3CA mutant breastcancers.DOI: 10.1007/s10637-018-0563-3 PMID: 29504069
