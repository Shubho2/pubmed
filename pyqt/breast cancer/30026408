Gan To Kagaku Ryoho. 2018 Jun;45(6):891-893.[Clinical Practice of Carcinoma of Unknown Primary].[Article in Japanese]Hasegawa Y(1), Mukai H.Author information: (1)Division of Breast and Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East.Carcinoma of unknown primary(CUP)is defined as the presence of metastatic cancer documented in the absence of an identifiable primary tumor site. According tothis definition, between 1% and 5% of cancer patients are diagnosed with thisclinical entity. CUPs are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms with widely varying natural histories and biologic characteristics. In this broad category, there are5 major diagnoses, as assessed by light microscopy: (1)poorly differentiatedneoplasm,(2) well differentiated and moderately differentiatedadenocarcinoma,(3)squamous cell carcinoma(4)neuroendocrine tumor, and(5)poorlydifferentiated carcinoma(with or without features of adenocarcinoma) .It has beenreported that the prognosis of patients with CUP is poor. The median survivaltime(MST)is 6 to 9 months, and less than 25% of the CUP patients are alive 1 yearafter diagnosis. Previous trials with a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens haveproduced response rates of less than 50% with negligible benefit in terms ofmedian survival. Platinum -containing regimens have induced higher response ratesthan those without it in patients with CUP, and platinum is considered a key drugin UPC treatment.PMID: 30026408
