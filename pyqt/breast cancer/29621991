Persephone is a non-inferiority randomisedcontrolled trial comparing 6- to 12-months of trastuzumab. In this trial therewill be a trade-off between a possible small decrease in disease-free survival(DFS) with 6-months and reduced cardiotoxicity and cost.METHODS: A structured questionnaire asked clinicians who had recruited patientsinto the Persephone trial about their prior beliefs with regards to the clinical effectiveness of trastuzumab and cardiotoxicity profile, in the comparison of 6- and 12-month durations.RESULTS: Fifty-one clinicians from 40 of the 152 Persephone sites completed thequestionnaire. 30/50 responders (60%) believed that 6-months trastuzumab wouldgive the same 4-year DFS rate as 12-months trastuzumab, with 21/50 (42%) holding this belief across all breast cancer subsets. In addition, 46/49 responders (94%)reported expecting to change their clinical practice to 6-months, with theirprior beliefs (most commonly 85% 4-year DFS rate with 6-months) being greaterthan their lowest acceptable rate (most commonly 83% 4-year DFS rate with6-months). Low levels of cardiotoxicity were expected with both 6 and 12-monthstrastuzumab, with the majority expecting lower levels with 6-months. Withincreasing hypothesised differences of cardiotoxicity rates between the twodurations, significantly lower levels of 4-year DFS with 6-months trastuzumabwere deemed acceptable (p < 0.0001).CONCLUSION: Most responders believe that 6-months trastuzumab is adequate, bothoverall and within each subset of breast cancer, and plan to change theirclinical practice if the Persephone results support their prior belief. Anindividual patient meta-analysis of the duration trials would give greaterprecision to estimates of the differences in efficacy and toxicity, and adequate statistical power to establish a 2% level of non-inferiority for 6-monthsadjuvant trastuzumab.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4307-8 PMCID: PMC5887251PMID: 29621991
