Blocking antibodies againstprogrammed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) leads to robust localtumor control and a durable response in patients with various tumors that arerefractory to standard treatments. Breast cancer was traditionally thought to be poorly immunogenic and yield a relatively lower mutation burden compared to'inflamed' tumors, including melanoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma.Accumulated results have demonstrated that higher T lymphocyte infiltration wasobserved in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 (HER2) breast cancer compared to estrogen receptor-positive,HER2-negative luminal breast cancer. Among molecular subtypes, single agentcancer immunotherapy showed the most promising results in TNBC. The developmentof immuno-oncology combinations is required to increase the clinical benefit ofimmunotherapy against breast cancer. Response to the immunotherapy depends on thedynamic interaction between tumor and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.In the era of precise medicine, exploration of actual immune response anddevelopment of biomarkers is required to maximize the clinical benefit of cancer immunotherapy.DOI: 10.21037/cco.2018.05.05 PMID: 30056730
