Active mutations ofPI3K catalytic subunit PIK3CA (e.g., H1047R) and amplification of its homologPIK3CB are observed in a large number of breast cancers. In recent years,aberrant activation of Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ)and its paralog Yes-associated protein (YAP) have also been found to be importantfor breast cancer development and progression. However, whether PI3K interactswith YAP/TAZ during mammary tumorigenesis is unknown. Through a systematicgain-of-function screen for kinases involved in mammary tumorigenesis, weidentified PIK3CB as a transformation-inducing kinase in breast cells. We furtherdetermined that PIK3CB positively regulates YAP and TAZ to promote transformationand inhibit mammary cell death in vitro PIK3CB coexpression with TAZ, rather thanPIK3CB or TAZ alone, in human MCF10A nontumorigenic mammary cells is sufficientfor tumor formation in mice in vivo Interestingly, we also determined thatPIK3CA-H1047R enhances YAP and TAZ activity in mammary tumorigenesis in vitroMechanistically, the regulation of YAP/TAZ by both PIK3CA and PIK3CB occursthrough multiple signaling pathways including LATS-dependent and LATS-independentpathways. Therefore, in this study, we determine that PI3K and YAP/TAZ interactto promote breast cancer cell transformation.Implications: This study providesthe first evidence that the Hippo pathway effectors TAZ and YAP are criticalmediators of PI3K-induced mammary tumorigenesis and synergistically functiontogether with PI3K in transformation of mammary cells. These findings may providea novel rationale for targeting YAP/TAZ alone or in combination with PI3Kinhibitors for breast cancer therapy in the future.
