However, suchapproaches are not viable with resistant cases or in triple-negative breastcancer (TNBC) patients, given the lack of Her2 and estrogen and progesteronereceptors in these patients. Thus, new drug targets are urgently required. Fromthis perspective, we searched for novel drug targets using proteomic analysis,and identified Eph receptor A10 (EphA10), which is elevated in breast cancercells as compared to normal breast tissue. Here, we evaluated the potential ofEphA10 as a drug target by analyzing its protein expression profile/function incancer cells, and then by using an anti-EphA10 antibody to treatEphA10-expressing tumor-bearing mice. Protein expression profile analysis showed that EphA10 was expressed in various breast cancer subtypes, including TNBCs,with no expression observed in normal tissues, apart from the testes. Moreover,functional analysis of the cancer cells revealed that ligand-dependentproliferation was observed in EphA10-expressed cancer cells. Thus, we developedour novel anti-EphA10 antibody, which binds to EphA10 with high specificity andaffinity at the nanomolar level. Finally, therapeutic analysis indicated thattumor growth was significantly suppressed in the mAb-treated mice in adose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the EphA10-targeting therapymay be a novel therapeutic option for the management of breast cancer, including in TNBCs which aren't currently treated with molecular-targeted agents.Consequently, we hope that these findings will contribute to the development of anew targeting therapy for refractory breast cancer patients.DOI: 10.1248/yakushi.17-00220-1 PMID: 29962467  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
