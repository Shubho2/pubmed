Methods: A total of 220 patients treated with NAC between1991 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Pathologic complete response (pCR)was defined as no evidence of residual invasive tumor in the breast and lymphnodes (LNs) (ypT0/Tis ypN0); partial response if there was no tumor in the LNsbut residual tumor in the breast (ypT+ ypN0) or residual tumor in the LNs(ypT0/Tis ypN+); and limited response if there was residual tumor in both thebreast and the LNs (ypT+ ypN+). Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazardsanalyses were performed to identify factors predictive for overall survival (OS).Results: A total of 155 patients were included. Following NAC, 39 patients(25.2%) achieved pCR, 57 (36.8%) achieved a partial response (either ypT+ ypN0 orypT0/Tis ypN+), and 59 (38.1%) had a limited response. A total of 22 patients(14.2%) experienced local failure, 20 (12.9%) experienced regional failure, and59 (38.1%) experienced distant failure. Median OS for patients who achieved pCRwas not reached, and was significantly worse for patients who had residualdisease in the breast and/or LNs (P<.001). No difference in OS was seen amongpatients who had residual disease in the breast alone versus those who remainedLN-positive (97 vs 83 months, respectively; P=.25). Subset analysis did notreveal differences in OS based on year of treatment or cN1 disease at the time ofinitial diagnosis. Conclusions: Women aged ≤40 years who achieved pCR hadexcellent outcomes; however, those who achieved a pathologic response in the LNs but had residual disease in the breast continued to have outcomes similar tothose who remained LN-positive.Copyright © 2018 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.DOI: 10.6004/jnccn.2018.7022 PMID: 30006427
