Electronic address: frantisek.staud@faf.cuni.cz.Atazanavir and ritonavir are preferred protease inhibitors frequently used incombination antiretroviral therapy for prevention of HIV mother-to-childtransmission. Although their use is associated with higher risk of congenitalanomalies, factors affecting atazanavir and ritonavir placental transfer are not known. This study is the first attempt to evaluate whether the placental drugefflux ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, p-glycoprotein (ABCB1), breastcancer resistance protein (ABCG2), and/or multidrug resistance-associatedproteins 2 (ABCC2), affect placental pharmacokinetics of atazanavir or ritonavir.Transport experiments across MDCKII cells expressing respective human ABC carriershowed that atazanavir is a substrate of ABCB1 and dual perfusion studies in arat placenta confirmed this finding. In conclusion, we suggest that placentalABCB1 might reduce ATV maternal-to-fetal transfer and therefore represent a site for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions of ATV. Further studies in humanplacenta models are necessary to provide additional data closer to clinicalenvironment.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
