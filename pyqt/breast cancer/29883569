In this context, the purpose of this study was to investigate the action of different nanoemulsions designed toencapsulate chloroaluminum phthalocyanine, a hydrophobic photosensitizer used in photodynamic therapy, and doxorubicin, a well-known chemotherapeutic agent usedto treat aggressive breast cancer cells. The mean nanostructured system sizeranged from 170.8 to 181.0 nm, and the nanoemulsions presented sphericalmorphology. All formulations exhibited negative zeta potential values (-68.7 to-75.0 mV) and suitable polydispersity values (0.20 to 0.28), explaining theircolloidal stability up to three months. Murine breast cancer cells (4T1) wereincubated with nanoemulsions for three hours at various concentrations and weresubjected to cell viability tests to find the concentration dependence profile.Thereafter, the in vitro phototoxic effect was evaluated in the presence of thevisible laser light irradiation. Less than 10% of 4T1 viable cells were observed when photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy were combined at a 1.0 J · cm-2 laser light dose with 1.0 μM phthalocyanine and 0.5 μM doxorubicin. The cell deathassay and cell cycle arrest analysis confirmed the therapy efficiencydemonstrating an increase in the apoptosis rate and in the cell cycle arrest onG2. Additionally, 15 genes related to apoptosis and 25 target genes ofanti-cancer drugs were overexpressed. Four genes related to apoptosis and fourtarget genes of anti-cancer drugs were downregulated in 4T1 cells after treatmentwith nanoemulsion with phthalocyanine and doxorubicin associated withphotodynamic therapy. Thus, the nanoemulsions loaded with phthalocyanine anddoxorubicin presented appropriate physical stability, improved photophysicalproperties, and remarkable activity in vitro to be considered as promisingformulations for photodynamic therapy and chemotherapeutic use in breast cancertreatment.DOI: 10.1166/jbn.2018.2558 PMID: 29883569
