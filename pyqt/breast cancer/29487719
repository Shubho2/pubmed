Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis including 26 published studies with 7656 patients identified fromPubMed and EBSCO to assess the prognostic impact of tumor-infiltrating CD57+lymphocytes in human solid tumors. We found that CD57+ lymphocyte infiltrationsignificantly improved overall survival (OS) including 1 - year, 3 - year and 5 -year survival, and disease - free survival (DFS) in all types of solid tumors. Instratified analyses, CD57+ lymphocyte infiltration was significantly associatedwith better OS in hepatocellular, esophageal, head and neck carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, 5 - year survival in colorectal cancer, and 3 - year and 5 -year survival in gastric cancer, but not with 1 - year survival in gastriccancer, or 1 - year or 3 - year survival in colorectal cancer. In addition, high density of intratumoral CD57+ lymphocytes was significantly inversely correlated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage of solid tumor. In conclusion, CD57+lymphocyte infiltration leads to a favorable clinical outcome in solid tumors,implicating that it is a useful biomarker for prognosis and adoptiveimmunotherapy based on these cells may be a promising choice for treatment.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.23621 PMCID: PMC5814286PMID: 29487719
