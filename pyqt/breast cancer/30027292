[Epub ahead of print]Association of Transforming Growth Factor β Polymorphism C-509T WithRadiation-Induced Fibrosis Among Patients With Early-Stage Breast Cancer: ASecondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.Grossberg AJ(1)(2), Lei X(3), Xu T(1), Shaitelman SF(1), Hoffman KE(1), BloomES(1), Stauder MC(1), Tereffe W(1), Schlembach PJ(1), Woodward WA(1), BuchholzTA(1), Smith BD(1).Author information: (1)Division of Radiation Oncology, Department of Radiation Oncology, TheUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.(2)Department of Radiation Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University,Portland.(3)Division of Cancer Prevention, Department of Health Services Research, TheUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.Importance: Whether genetic factors can identify patients at risk forradiation-induced fibrosis remains unconfirmed.Objective: To assess the association between the C-509T variant allele in thepromoter region of TGFB1 and breast fibrosis 3 years after radiotherapy.Design, Setting, and Participants: This is an a priori-specified, prospective,cohort study nested in an open-label, randomized clinical trial, which wasconducted in community-based and academic cancer centers to comparehypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (WBI) (42.56 Gy in 16 fractions) withconventionally fractionated WBI (50 Gy in 25 fractions) after breast-conservingsurgery. In total, 287 women 40 years or older with pathologically confirmedstage 0 to IIA breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery were enrolledfrom February 2011 to February 2014. Patients were observed for a minimum of 3years. Outcomes were compared using the 1-sided Fisher exact test andmultivariable logistic regression.Exposures: A C-to-T single-nucleotide polymorphism at position -509 relative tothe first major transcription start site (C-509T) of the TGFB1 gene.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was grade 2 or higher breastfibrosis as assessed using the Late Effects Normal Tissue/Subjective, Objective, Medical Management, Analytic scale (range, 0 to 3) three years afterradiotherapy.Results: Among 287 women enrolled in the trial, TGFB1 genotype and 3-yearradiotherapy-induced toxicity data were available for 174 patients, of whom 89patients (51%) with a mean (SD) age of 60 (8) years had at least 1 copy ofC-509T. Grade 2 or higher breast fibrosis was present in 12 of 87 patients withC-509T (13.8%) compared with 3 of 80 patients without the allele variant (3.8%)(absolute difference, 10.0%; 95% CI, 1.7%-18.4%; P = .02). The results ofmultivariable analyses indicated that only C-509T (odds ratio, 4.47; 95% CI,1.25-15.99; P = .02) and postoperative cosmetic outcome (odds ratio, 7.09; 95%CI, 2.41-20.90; P < .001) were significantly associated with breast fibrosisrisk.Conclusions and Relevance: To date, this study seems to be the first prospective validation of a genomic marker for radiation fibrosis. The C-509T allele in TGFB1is a key determinant of breast fibrosis risk. Assessing TGFB1 genotype mayfacilitate a more personalized approach to locoregional treatment decisions inbreast cancer.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01266642.DOI: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.2583 PMID: 30027292
