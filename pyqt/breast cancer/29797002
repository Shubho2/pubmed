Allpatients underwent sequential PET/CT and MRI. For fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PETimage analysis, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of FDG wasassessed at both 1 and 2 h and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesionglycolysis (TLG). The kinetic analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRIparameters was performed using dynamic enhancement curves. We assesseddiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-MRI parameters regarding apparent diffusioncoefficient (ADC) values. Histologic grades 1 and 2 were classified as low-grade,and grade 3 as high-grade tumor.RESULTS: Forty-five lesions of 78 patients were classified as histologic grade 3,while 26 and 7 lesions were grade 2 and grade 1, respectively. Patients withhigh-grade tumors showed significantly lower ADC-mean values than patients withlow-grade tumors (0.99 ± 0.19 vs.1.12 ± 0.32, p = 0.007). With respect toSUVmax1, MTV2.5, and TLG2.5, patients with high-grade tumors showed higher valuesthan patients with low-grade tumors: SUVmax1 (7.92 ± 4.5 vs.6.19 ± 3.05,p = 0.099), MTV2.5 (7.90 ± 9.32 vs.4.38 ± 5.10, p = 0.095), and TLG2.5(40.83 ± 59.17 vs.19.66 ± 26.08, p = 0.082). However, other parameters did notreveal significant differences between low-grade and high-grade malignancies. In receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, ADC-mean values showedthe highest area under the curve of 0.681 (95%CI 0.566-0.782) for assessinghigh-grade malignancy.CONCLUSIONS: Lower ADC-mean values may predict the poor differentiation of breastcancer among diverse PET-MRI functional parameters.DOI: 10.1007/s12149-018-1259-7 PMID: 29797002
