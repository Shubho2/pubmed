Since associated morbidity is not negligible, it is highly relevant to pursue a more minimally invasive alternative. The purpose ofthis study was to prospectively evaluate the sensitivity of fine needleaspiration cytology (FNAC) with combined gamma probe and ultrasound (US) guidancein comparison with the gold standard histology of the sentinel node (SN) afterSLNB for detecting metastasis.METHODS: The study was designed as a prospective, multicentre, open-label,single-arm trial enrolling patients with newly diagnosed cutaneous melanoma orbreast cancer between May 2015 and August 2017. Sample radioactivity was measuredusing a Mini 900 scintillation monitor. After FNAC, all patients underwent SLNB. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictivevalue (NPV) were estimated.RESULTS: Accrual was terminated early following an unplanned interim analysisindicating that a FNAC sensitivity of at least 80% could not be achieved. Intotal 58 patients of the originally planned 116 patients underwent FNAC withgamma probe and US guidance. There were no true-positive FNAC results, 14false-negative results and one false-positive result, and thus the sensitivity,specificity, PPV and NPV of FNAC were 0%, 98%, 0% and 75%, respectively. At least75% of the FNAC samples had a radioactivity signal higher than the backgroundsignal.CONCLUSION: FNAC with gamma probe and US guidance is not able to correctly detectmetastases in the SN and is therefore not able to replace SLNB. Gammaprobe-guided US is a highly accurate method for correctly identifying the SN,which offers possibilities for future research.DOI: 10.1007/s00259-018-4014-3 PMID: 29700573
