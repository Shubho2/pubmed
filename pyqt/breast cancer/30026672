This study aimed to explore the expression profile andpotential function of lncRNAs in TNBC through bioinformatic methods.Methods: Two microarrays of TNBC were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibusdatabase. Differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were screened out and theexpressions of top lncRNAs and overlapping lncRNAs were validated using data fromThe Cancer Genome Atlas database. The co-expression analysis of lncRNAs and mRNAswas conducted using R software and functional enrichment analysis for wasperformed by Metascape. Kaplan-Meier Plotter was used for survival analysis.Results: A total of 1034 dysregulated lncRNAs were found in the two microarrays, and there were 8 overlapped lncRNAs. Among them, 537 lncRNAs were significantlycorrelated with 451 protein-coding genes (PCGs). The co-expressed PCGs weremainly enriched in terms including cell division, cell cycle, and protein/DNAbinding, and were involved in pathways in cancer and other pathways such asPI3K-Akt, MAPK, ErbB and p53 signaling pathways. Hub-genes in the co-expressionnetwork were identified, and 7 of them were associated with relapse-free survivalof TNBC (MAGI2-AS3: HR = 0.51; GGTA1P: HR = 0.54; NAP1L2: HR = 0.59; CRABP2:HR = 0.41; SYNPO2: HR = 0.50; MKI67: HR = 2.23; COL4A6: HR = 1.91; all P < 0.05).Conclusions: Numerous lncRNAs were dysregulated in TNBC, and many of them arepossibly involved in cancer biology. Several of these lncRNAs were associatedwith of TNBC prognosis, which can be promising biomarkers.DOI: 10.1186/s12935-018-0598-8 PMCID: PMC6050698PMID: 30026672
