The aimof the present study was to assess the clinical relevance of serum VEGF (sVEGF)in a large cohort of metastatic breast cancer patients and to explore therelationship between sVEGF and other blood-based biomarkers.METHODS: Two hundred fifty-three patients with metastatic breast cancer wereenrolled in this prospective, multicentre study. Blood samples were collectedbefore start of first-line or later-line treatment. sVEGF was quantified by acommercially available ELISA. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were detected using CellSearch and other biomarkers (EGFR, HER2, RAS p21, TIMP1, CAIX) by ELISA.RESULTS: Levels of sVEGF were determined in all patients, with a medianconcentration of 231 pg/ml. After a median follow-up of 19 months, median overallsurvival (OS) was 10.2 months in patients with sVEGF levels above the upperquartile (i.e. 367 pg/ml), while median OS has not been reached in patients with sVEGF < 367 pg/ml (p < 0.001). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was4.8 months for patients with sVEGF ≥ 367 pg/ml versus 9.1 months with sVEGFlevels < 367 pg/ml (p < 0.001). Patients with sVEGF levels ≥ 367 pg/ml and ≥ 5CTCs had the shortest OS, while those with sVEGF < 367 pg/ml and non-elevatedCTCs had the longest OS. CTCs, grading, line of therapy and RAS p21 wereindependent predictors of OS. sVEGF, line of therapy and CTCs were independentpredictors of PFS in the multivariate analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic breast cancer patients with elevated levels of sVEGF havesignificantly worse clinical outcome. This finding supports the biological roleof VEGF in breast cancer.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN59722891 (DETECT).DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4882-z PMID: 30003393
