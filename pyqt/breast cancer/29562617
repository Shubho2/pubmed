The structure of the new compound was identified usingspectroscopic data (¹H-NMR, 13C-NMR and two dimensions NMR). Its anticancerproperties were evaluated using the3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assayagainst four human cells including lung cancer cells (A549), breast cancer cells (MCF-7), gastric cancer cells (SGC7901) and noncancerous human umbilical veinendothelial cells (HUVEC). A new phenylpropanoid-(E)-caffeicacid-9-O-β-d-xylpyranosyl-(1→2)-β-d-glucopyranosyl ester (1), with seven knowncompounds (2-8)-was isolated. The IC50 value of compound 1 against MCF-7 cellswas 2.65 ± 0.14 µM, and the IC50 values of compound 8 against three cancer cells were below 20 µM.DOI: 10.3390/molecules23030680 PMID: 29562617
