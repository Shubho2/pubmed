Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome in the ipsilateral limb may not receive appropriate surgical therapy (carpal tunnel release) because of concerns that it may trigger or worsen lymphedema.METHODS: A state transition cohort model was used to evaluate the treatmentoptions for breast cancer survivors at risk of upper extremity lymphedemapresenting with carpal tunnel syndrome. The model reflected three treatmentstrategies: (1) early surgical intervention, (2) delayed surgical intervention,or (3) nonsurgical management. Both life-years and quality-adjusted life-yearswere modeled over a 30-year time horizon.RESULTS: Over a 30-year time horizon, the preferred strategy was delayed surgery,which resulted in 21.41 quality-adjusted life-years. Early surgery andnonsurgical management yielded 20.42 and 21.06 quality-adjusted life-years,respectively. The model was robust and was not sensitive to variation in any ofthe parameters within the clinically plausible ranges.CONCLUSIONS: Based on this decision analytic model, the optimal choice for breastcancer survivors with mild carpal tunnel syndrome who are at risk for lymphedema would be delaying surgery until severe symptoms develop. This strategy balancesthe potential increased risk of lymphedema following carpal tunnel release withthe decreased long-term risk of severe carpal tunnel syndrome. The modelcomprehensively assesses a controversial area in the breast cancer and handsurgery literature to inform decision-making for patients and clinicians.DOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004318 PMID: 29697616
