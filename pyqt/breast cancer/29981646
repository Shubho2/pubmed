A retrospective study was conducted on 842 patientsunderwent quadrantectomy for breast cancer, 332 of them underwent USGQ, whereas550 underwent PGQ. The histological type of the tumors and the margin statusobtained with the histological examination were compared. The histologicalexamination of the surgical specimen showed involvement of the margins in 24/842 patients (2.85%), 22 (2.61%) of them belonged to the PGQ group, and two to theUSGQ group (P = 0.0011). The highest rate of microscopically positive marginswas, statistically significant, for carcinoma in situ, when compared withpatients with invasive carcinoma (0.0001). USGQ technique showed severaladvantages compared with PGQ. In fact, the former notes a lower positive marginrate and, consequently, a lower rate of reintervention. In addition, it maychange the surgeon's attitude by causing him to remove another slice of margin toensure more histological negativity. It should be the gold standard technique forbreast-conservative surgery of palpable tumors.PMID: 29981646  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
