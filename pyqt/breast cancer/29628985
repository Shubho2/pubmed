The prognosis of breast cancer ispoor in patients with other primary cancers. However, there have been fewclinical studies regarding this issue. Therefore, we analyzed the characteristicsand prognosis of patients with breast cancer with multiple primary cancers(MPCs).Methods: Data from the Korean Breast Cancer Society Registry were analyzed. Data from enrolled patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer were analyzed for differences in prognosis dependent on the presence of MPCs, and which MPCcharacteristics affected their prognosis.Results: Among the 41,841 patients analyzed, 913 patients were found to haveMPCs, accounting for 950 total MPCs. There was a significant difference insurvival rates between the breast cancer only group and the MPC group. The 5-yearsurvival rates were 93.6% and 86.7% and the 10-year survival rates were 87.5% and70.4%, respectively. Among the 913 patients with MPCs, patients with two or more MPCs had significantly worse prognoses than patients with a single MPC. Withrespect to the time interval between breast cancer and MPC occurrence, patientswith a 5-year or greater interval had significantly better prognoses thanpatients with less than 1 year between occurrences. Among MPCs, thyroid cancerwas the most common primary cancer. However, this type was not related to theprognosis of breast cancer. Gynecologic cancer, colorectal cancer, uppergastrointestinal cancer, and lung cancer were related to breast cancer prognosis.Conclusion: MPCs were a poor prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer.Two or more MPCs and a shorter time interval between occurrences were worseprognostic factors. Although MPCs were a poor prognostic factor, thyroid cancerdid not affect the prognosis of patients with breast cancer.DOI: 10.4048/jbc.2018.21.1.62 PMCID: PMC5880967PMID: 29628985
