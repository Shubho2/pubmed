[Epub ahead of print]Clinical Course and Complications of Catheter and Non-Catheter-Related UpperExtremity Deep Vein Thrombosis in Patients with Cancer.Mansour A(1), Saadeh SS(2), Abdel-Razeq N(3), Khozouz O(1), Abunasser M(2),Taqash A(4).Author information: (1)1 Department of Radiology, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan.(2)2 Department of Internal Medicine, King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan.(3)3 Department on Internal Medicine, Istishari Hospital, Amman, Jordan.(4)4 Office of Scientific Affairs and Research, King Hussein Cancer Center,Amman, Jordan.Patients with cancer have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Upperextremity venous system is a peculiar site, and little is known about theclinical course in patients with cancer. Electronic medical records were searchedfor patients with cancer with a diagnosis of upper extremity venous thrombosis.Individual patient data were reviewed. Eighty-seven patients were identified, andthe median age was 52.4. The most common underlying malignancies were breast(23.0%), colorectal (18.4%), and gastroesophageal (18.4%). Median time fromcancer diagnosis to upper extremity venous thromboembolism (UEDVT) was 3.44months. Subclavian vein was the most common involved site (56.3%) and 54.0%patients had a central venous catheter; 50.6% of patients developed acomplication; pulmonary embolism (PE) in 9.2%, superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome in 14.9%, and 26.4% had postthrombotic syndrome. In patients with isolated singlevein thrombosis, complications were higher in the subset with internal jugularvein involvement compared to other sites (68.2% vs 52.2%) as were complicationsin patients with non-catheter-related thrombosis compared to patients with acentral venous catheter in place (55% vs 27.7%). Median overall survival fromtime of cancer and UEDVT diagnoses was 29.6 and 13.25 months, respectively. Inconclusion, UEDVT is an uncommon event. Around 50% developed a complicationincluding PE, SVC or postthrombotic syndromes. Larger studies are needed tobetter identify risks associated with thrombosis and the best therapeuticapproach and duration in this unique subset of patients with cancer.DOI: 10.1177/1076029618788177 PMID: 30025472
