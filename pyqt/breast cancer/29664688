Toassess the predictive value of preoperative inflammatory cells for response torhTPO in breast cancer patients, a total of 198 female patients with breastcancer were enrolled between June 2011 and December 2016 in Liaoning CancerHospital. Peripheral blood samples before rhTPO therapy were obtained, the ratiosof helper T cell (CD4+), cytotoxic T cell (CD8+), NK cell (CD16+/CD56+), and Bcell (CD19+) were analyzed, and CD4/CD8 ratios were calculated. The associationbetween each marker and response to rhTPO was analyzed using the log-rank test.Of 198 patients, response was achieved in 151 (76.26%) patients. The predictiveof CD4+/CD8+ ratio gave a sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 80% in thetraining cohort and a sensitivity and specificity of 73% and 87% in the testcohort, when the cutoff value was set to 1.56. Plasma levels of NK cell ratio andB cell ratio were similar in either responders or nonresponders for rhTPO. PlasmaCD4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly lower in responders than in nonresponders forrhTPO (1.27 ± 0.49 vs. 2.24 ± 0.92, P < 0.05). Among 83 patients with grade 2CIT, plasma CD4+/CD8+ ratio was lower significantly in rhTPO responders than inrhTPO nonresponders (1.19 ± 0.47 vs. 2.22 ± 1.11, P < 0.05) with 83% accuracy,but we observed little significant differences in patients with grade 3/4 CIT(1.32 ± 0.51 vs. 2.25 ± 0.77, P < 0.05) with 76% accuracy. Plasma CD4+/CD8+ ratioat baseline was significantly associated with response to rhTPO. We conclude thatpretreatment CD4+/CD8+ ratio is a convenient, easily measured predictiveindicator for patients with breast cancer receiving rhTPO, especially in patientswith grade 2 CIT.DOI: 10.1089/jir.2017.0146 PMID: 29664688
