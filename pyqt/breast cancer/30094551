Adherence to AItherapy, including letrozole, remains problematic due to the development ofdebilitating AI-induced arthralgia. Letrozole is metabolized in the liver byCYP2A6. It remains unknown if plasma letrozole levels or CYP2A6 genetic variationis associated with the development of arthralgia.METHODS: We enrolled 126 female breast cancer patients initiated on letrozoletherapy and prospectively collected blood samples at baseline and two follow-uptime points to determine letrozole plasma concentrations and CYP2A6 genotype. At each visit, participants completed two validated questionnaires to assess theseverity of arthralgia symptoms.RESULTS: More than half (55%) of patients experienced a significant increase intheir arthralgia symptoms after initiation of treatment. The clinical variablesof body mass index (P = 0.0003) and age (P = 0.0430) were negatively andpositively associated with plasma letrozole concentrations, respectively. CYP2A6 genotype was significantly associated with letrozole levels (P < 0.0001), andincreased plasma letrozole levels were observed in patients with CYP2A6reduced-function genotypes. Plasma levels of letrozole and CYP2A6 genotype werenot significantly associated with a change in pain score from baseline.CONCLUSIONS: CYP2A6 genotype was a significant predictor of letrozole plasmalevels, but was not associated with the development of arthralgia.DOI: 10.1007/s10549-018-4910-z PMID: 30094551
