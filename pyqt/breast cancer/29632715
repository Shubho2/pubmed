HER-2/neu overexpression in murine fibroblasts and human model systems is inversely correlated with BGNexpression. Upon its restoration BGNhigh HER-2/neu+ fibroblasts were lesstumorigenic in immune competent mice when compared to BGNlow/neg HER-2/neu+cells, which was associated with enhanced immune cell responses and higherfrequencies of immune effector cells in tumors and peripheral blood. Theincreased immunogenicity of BGNhigh HER-2/neu+ fibroblasts appears to be due toupregulated MHC class I surface antigens and reduced expression levels oftransforming growth factor (TGF)-β isoforms and the TGF-β receptor 1 suggesting alink between BGN, TGF-β pathway and HER-2/neu-mediated downregulation of MHCclass I antigens. Treatment of BGNlow/neg HER-2/neu+ cells with recombinant BGNor an inhibitor of TGF-β enhanced MHC class I surface antigens in BGNlow/negHER-2/neu-overexpressing murine fibroblasts, which was mediated by atranscriptional upregulation of major MHC class I antigen processing components. Furthermore, BGN expression in HER-2/neu+ cells was accompanied by an increasedexpression of the proteoglycan decorin (DCN). Since recombinant DCN also elevatedMHC class I surface expression in BGNlow/neg HER-2/neu+ cells, both proteoglycansmight act synergistically. This was in accordance with in silico analyses of mRNAdata obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset available for breastcancer (BC) patients. Thus, our data provide for the first time evidence thatproteoglycan signatures are modulated by HER-2/neu and linked to MHC classI-mediated immune escape associated with an altered TGF-β pathway.DOI: 10.1080/2162402X.2017.1373233 PMCID: PMC5889282 [Available on 2019-01-16]PMID: 29632715
