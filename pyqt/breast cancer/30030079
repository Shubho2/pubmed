Indicaxanthin has pharmacokinetic proprieties,rarely found in other phytochemicals, and it has been demonstrated that itprovides a broad-spectrum of pharmaceutical activity, exertinganti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and neuromodulator effects. The discovery of the Indicaxanthin physiological targets plays an important role inunderstanding the biochemical mechanism. In this study, combined reversepharmacophore mapping, reverse docking, and text-based database search identifiedInositol Trisphosphate 3-Kinase (ITP3K-A), Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII),Leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H), Phosphoserine phosphatase (HPSP),Phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), AMPA receptor (GluA3 and GluA2 subunits) andKainate receptor (GluK1 isoform) as potential targets for Indicaxanthin. Thesetargets are implicated in neuromodulation, and inflammatory regulation, normally expressed mostly in the CNS, and expressed (or overexpressed) in cancer tissues(i.e. breast, thyroid, and prostate cancer cells). Moreover, this study provides qualitative and quantitative information about dynamic interactions ofIndicaxanthin at the binding site of target proteins, through molecular dynamics simulations and MM-GBSA.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
