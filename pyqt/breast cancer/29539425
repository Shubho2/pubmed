In this study, we use murine syngeneic tumor models and in vitro assaysto investigate the impact of abemaciclib on T cells, the tumor immunemicroenvironment and the ability to combine with anti-PD-L1 blockade. Abemaciclibmonotherapy resulted in tumor growth delay that was associated with an increased T cell inflammatory signature in tumors. Combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy led to complete tumor regressions and immunological memory, accompanied by enhancedantigen presentation, a T cell inflamed phenotype, and enhanced cell cyclecontrol. In vitro, treatment with abemaciclib resulted in increased activation ofhuman T cells and upregulated expression of antigen presentation genes in MCF-7breast cancer cells. These data collectively support the clinical investigationof the combination of abemaciclib with agents such as anti-PD-L1 that modulateT cell anti-tumor immunity.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).
