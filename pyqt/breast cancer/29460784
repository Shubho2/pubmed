Fattyacids (FA) have a structural role in cell membranes and play an important rolefor many physiological and pathological immunologic pathways. Several prospectivestudies have been conducted on circulating fatty acids and the risk of prostate, breast and other cancers. The present study aimed to determine the saturatedfatty acid composition differences of red blood cells (RBCs) in BCC patients and healthy control.METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted on new cases diagnosedof BCC patients. All subjects completed dietary recalls for dietary assessment.After fatty acids extraction, purification and preparation, gas chromatographywas performed. The results were expressed in relative values (percent).RESULTS: Cases had lower RBC levels of Caproic acid (6:0) (P < 0.001), Caprylicacid (8:0) (P = 0.01), Capric acid (10:0) (P = 0.01), Palmitic acid (16:0)(P = 0.02) and higher RBC level of Pentadecanoic acid (15:0) (P = 0.04) andStearic acid (18:0) (P = 0.01) compared with controls but did not differ in thelevel of the other primary saturated fatty acids. Saturation Index as defined by Stearic to Oleic acid ratio was significantly lower in BCC patients in comparisonwith Control group (P = 0.02).CONCLUSION: Here we showed that BCC patient had considerable differences in theSFA profiles in comparison with healthy subjects.Copyright © 2017 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.Published by Elsevier Ltd.
