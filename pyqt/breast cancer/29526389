We aimed todevelop and evaluate the first comprehensive guidelines for oncology physiciansand nurses, on how to positively and effectively involve family caregivers ofadult patients in consultations and patient care (TRIO Guidelines-1) and how tomanage challenging interactions with family caregivers (TRIO Guidelines-2).METHODS: The TRIO Guidelines were based on a comprehensive literature review and input from an expert advisory group (n = 10). They underwent two rounds of formalevaluation via an online Delphi consensus process involving international experts(n = 35), and a subset were piloted with 24 breast cancer clinicians in aworkshop format.RESULTS: TRIO Guidelines-1 incorporate strategies and sub-strategies onfacilitating collaborative and effective family involvement (6 topics). Examplewording, behaviours, and level of evidence are provided throughout. All 24clinicians rated the guidelines as helpful after the pilot workshop.CONCLUSION: These guidelines will be a useful educational tool for clinicians andmedical/nursing students.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: By equipping clinicians with strategies to facilitateeffective and collaborative family engagement, the TRIO Guidelines have thepotential to transform communication in clinical practice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
