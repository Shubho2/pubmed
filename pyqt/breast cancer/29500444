Caveolin-1 was shown to promote T-DM1 internalization and enhance drug sensitivity. Whether caveolin-1 can be overexpressed to improve T-DM1 efficacy isinteresting and has the potential for clinical application. In this study,diabetes drug metformin was investigated in terms of induction of caveolin-1expression for increased efficacy of subsequent T-DM1 application. BT-474 cellswere pretreated with metformin, followed by combined therapy with metformin andT-DM1. The T-DM1 internalization and drug efficacy were determined, and theprotein expressions for signal transduction were also monitored. Caveolin-1 shRNAwas applied to suppress endogenous caveolin-1 expression, and the ability ofmetformin to promote T-DM1 efficacy was investigated. Result showed that inBT-474 cells pretreated with metformin, cellular caveolin-1 overexpression wasinduced, which then promoted drug efficacy by enhancing T-DM1 internalization. Ascellular caveolin-1 was suppressed by shRNA, the effect of metformin-enhancedT-DM1 cytotoxicity was decreased. This study demonstrated that metformin can beapplied prior to T-DM1 treatment to improve the clinical efficacy of T-DM1 byenhancing caveolin-1-mediated endocytosis.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-22250-8 PMCID: PMC5834501PMID: 29500444
