Practices leading to overdiagnosis may relateto defensive medicine. In this study, we evaluated the association betweenmalpractice climate and incidence of thyroid, breast, prostate, colon, and lungcancer in U.S. states from 1999-2012 using publicly available government data.State-level malpractice risk was quantified as malpractice payout rate, thenumber of malpractice payouts per 100,000 people per state per year. Associationsbetween state-level cancer incidence, malpractice payout rate, and several cancerrisk factors were evaluated. Risk factors included several social determinants ofhealth, including factors predicting healthcare access. States with highermalpractice payout rate had higher thyroid cancer incidence, on both univariateanalysis (r = 0.51, P = 0.009, Spearman) and multivariate analysis (P<0.001,multilevel model). In contrast, state-level malpractice payout rate was notassociated with incidence of any other cancer type. Malpractice climate may be a social determinant for being diagnosed with thyroid cancer. This may be a productof greater defensive medicine in states with higher malpractice risk, which leadsto increased diagnostic testing of patients with thyroid nodules and potentialoverdiagnosis. Alternatively, malpractice risk may be a proxy for another,unmeasured risk factor.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199862 PMCID: PMC6051569PMID: 30020955
