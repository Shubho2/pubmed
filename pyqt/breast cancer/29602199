However, 20% to 30% of those patientsare resistant to tamoxifen treatment. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have beenimplicated as one of the mechanisms responsible for tamoxifen resistance. Ourprevious study indicated that decreased expression of the CRB3 gene confers stem cell characteristics to breast cancer cells. In the current investigation, wefound that most of the breast cancer patient tissues resistant to tamoxifen were negative for CRB3 protein and positive for β-catenin protein, in contrast totheir matched primary tumours by immunohistochemical analysis. Furthermore,expression of CRB3 mRNA and protein was low, while expression of β-catenin mRNAand protein was high in tamoxifen resistance cells (LCC2 and T47D TamR) contrast to their corresponding cell lines MCF7 and T47D. Similarly, CRB3 overexpressionmarkedly restored the tamoxifen sensitivity of TamR cells by the MTT viabilityassay. Finally, we found that CRB3 suppressed the stemness of TamR cells byinhibiting β-catenin signalling, which may in turn lead to a decrease in thebreast cancer cell population. Furthermore, these findings indicate that CRB3 is an important regulator for breast cancer stemness, which is associated withtamoxifen resistance.© 2018 The Authors.
