However, residual lesion assessments based on preoperative imaging oftendiffer from postoperative pathologic diagnoses. We retrospectively reviewed theaccuracy of preoperative residual lesion assessments, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cases to find criteria for cases in which surgery can be omitted.METHODS: We reviewed 201 patients who received preoperative chemotherapy andsurgery in our hospital from January 2013 to November 2016. Presurgicalevaluations regarding the possible existence of residual lesions, and clinicalComplete Response (cCR) or non-cCR, were compared with postoperative pathologicaldiagnoses.RESULTS: Of the 201 patients, 52 were diagnosed with cCR, and 39 withpathological complete response (pCR). Predictions for residual lesions were 86.4%sensitive, 76.9% specific, and 84.6% accurate. When patients were divided into 4 groups by estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 status, sensitivity in each group wasER+/HER2-: 91.4%; ER-/HER2-: 94.1%; ER+/HER2+: 78.6%; and ER-/HER2+: 78.5%. Ofthe 22 patients preoperatively assessed with cCR, but diagnosed with non-pCR, themedian invasive residual tumor size was 2 mm (range 0-46 mm); 5 patients (22.7%) had only DCIS.CONCLUSIONS: Predicting residual lesions after preoperative chemotherapy by usingMRI and US is a reasonable strategy. However, current methods are inadequate for identifying patients who can omit surgery; therefore, a new strategy fordetecting small tumors in these patients is needed.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0856-6 PMID: 29619758
