Acombination of conventional chemotherapeutic agent; docetaxel (DTX) andantioxidant agent; alpha lipoic acid (ALA) which acts by preventing metastasismay fulfill idealness of control and targeted drug delivery against breastcancer. The objective of the current study is to develop a reverse-phase HPLC-UV method for simultaneous determination of DTX and ALA in lipid-basednanoformulations. DTX and ALA were separated on Intersil® ODS (C18) column (250 ×4.6 mm, 5 μm) with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile: sodium acetatebuffer (pH 3.5; 10 mM) (65:35% v/v) run in isocratic mode at a flow rate of 1mL/min. The developed method was validated as per ICH guidelines. The methodshowed linearity in the concentration range of 1-15 μg/mL for DTX and 2-30 μg/mL for ALA. It can detect minimum 200 ng/mL of DTX and 500 ng/mL of ALA. The method was further successfully applied in lipid-based formulation characterization. In conclusion, a simple, accurate and precise reverse-phase HPLC-UV method wasestablished for simultaneous determination of DTX and ALA in nanoformulations.DOI: 10.1093/chromsci/bmy064 PMID: 29992274
