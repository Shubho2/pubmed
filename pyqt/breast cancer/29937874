The data were re-evaluated by the pathologist andradiologist who were blinded to the patients' data.Results: FNAC and immunohistochemistry confirmed the ultrasonography (US)suspected TM in eight breast cancer patients. Clinically both unilateral andbilateral TM was seen, which were symptomless and metachronously (6-121 months)metastasized. Six of eight cases exhibited recurrence/distant metastasis and weretreated with chemotherapy/thyroidectomy of which two cases passed away. Theremaining two patients had no recurrences/distant metastases and were treatedwith partial/total thyroidectomy. Post-chemotherapy US showed more homogenousthyroid parenchyma with gathering of calcification that reduced in size,revealing the sensitiveness of TM to chemotherapy.Conclusion: US was useful in screening TM in breast cancer patients. Both partialand total thyroidectomy was effective in disease free survival of isolated TMcases, with controlled primary condition. TM responded well to chemotherapy inmost of the recurrent breast cancer cases with or without distant metastasis.DOI: 10.4314/ahs.v17i4.11 PMCID: PMC5870294PMID: 29937874
