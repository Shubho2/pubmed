In thisstudy, we aimed to investigate the interactions between HE4 expression andmolecular subtypes of breast carcinomas.Methods: HE4 expressions were studied in 242 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embeddedbreast carcinoma specimens and their association with different pathological and clinical parameters was evaluated.Results: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for HE4 was negative in 3 (1.2%)cases, weakly positive (1+) in 7 (2.9%) cases, moderately positive (2+) in 58(24.0%) cases, and strongly positive (3+) in 174 (71.9%) cases. A correlationbetween IHC HE4 staining grade and molecular groups was detected (P = 0.005).Furthermore, it was found that HE4 expression was strongly associated withhistological tumor grade, c-erbB2 expression, and positive fluorescence in situhybridization test results that detect human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2)/neu amplification (P = 0.022, P = 0.014, and P = 0.011).Conclusion: This study showed that HE4 expression is associated with HER2/neuamplification in breast cancers. These results may be commented as HE4 expressionrises in patients with HER2/neu amplification. As is known, HER2/neuamplification is a poor diagnostic factor in breast cancer and HE4 expression is possibly associated with poor prognosis.DOI: 10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_465_17 PMID: 30004048
