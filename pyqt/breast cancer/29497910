The safety in terms of regional disease control after this procedure remains unclear. This studyevaluates occurrence of regional recurrence as first event in patients with IBTR and negative rSLNB, treated without additional lymph node dissection.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the Sentinel Node and RecurrentBreast Cancer (SNARB) study. In 201 patients, tumor-negative rSLNB was obtainedwithout performing additional lymph node dissections.RESULTS: With median follow-up of 4.7 (range 0.9-12.7) years, regional recurrenceoccurred after median time of 3.0 (range 0.4-6.7) years in 4.5% (N = 9) ofpatients as first event after IBTR and rSLNB. In four of these nine patients, thesite of recurrence was in concordance with the anatomical location of rSLNB. Two of the nine recurrences were reported in the ipsilateral axilla, resulting in an ipsilateral axillary regional recurrence rate of 1.0%. In the other sevenpatients, regional recurrence occurred in aberrant basins. Univariable analysisshowed that triple-negative IBTR and lower amount of radioactive-labeled tracer(99mtechnetium) used during rSLNB were associated with developing regionalrecurrence as first event after negative rSLNB (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The risk of developing regional recurrence after negative rSLNB islow. The low relapse rate supports the safety of rSLNB as primary nodal stagingtool in IBTR. The time has come for clinical guidelines to adopt rSLNB asaxillary staging tool in patients with IBTR.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6384-y PMCID: PMC5891565PMID: 29497910
