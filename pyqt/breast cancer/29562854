Humoral and cellular immune responseand antitumor effect was evaluated using a syngeneic mice tumor model.RESULTS: All recombinant proteins induced secretion of IL-4 and particularlyIFN-Î³ and IL-17 cytokines. Challenging of immunized mice with stable 4T1-HER2transfected cells resulted in partial but significant tumor growth inhibition in all groups of mice particularly those immunized with fHER2-ECD together with CPG.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the recombinant HER2-ECD subdomains inducemainly Th1 and Th17 responses, which seem to contribute to tumor growthinhibition in syngeneic mice.DOI: 10.2217/imt-2017-0181 PMID: 29562854
