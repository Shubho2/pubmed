China.Recent studies have suggested that ubiquitin-specific peptidase (USP)18 may actas an oncogene in various types of cancer. Although the role of USP18 in breastcancer cell lines has been elucidated, the underlying mechanisms and clinicalrole of USP18 in breast cancer are currently not well understood. Thebioinformatics analysis and experimental results of the present studydemonstrated that aberrant promoter methylation led to increased expression ofUSP18 in breast cancer. In addition, correlation analysis suggested that anegative correlation between methylation and USP18 mRNA expression was observedin The Cancer Genome Atlas database. USP18 promoted cell proliferation, colonyformation and cell cycle progression in vitro. Furthermore, the Gene SetEnrichment Analysis results demonstrated that USP18 may be negatively associated with apoptosis in patients with breast cancer. Bioinformatics analysis resultsindicated that USP18 was also revealed to be associated with the protein kinase B(AKT) signaling pathway and mammary tumorigenesis in vivo. In addition, theresults indicated that USP18 may promote the epidermal growth factor(EGF)-mediated EGF receptor (EGFR)/AKT/S‑phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2)pathway by upregulating EGFR and Skp2 in a AKT/forkhead box O3-dependent mannerin breast cancer. The results of bioinformatics analysis revealed that increased USP18 expression was associated with a higher TNM stage and unfavorable prognosisin clinical patients. USP18 was also significantly enhanced in patients withhuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer; furthermore,Kaplan‑Meier curve demonstrated that combining USP18 and Skp2 expression improvedprognostic capability in breast cancer. Taken together, these results suggestedthat USP18 may serve a key role in breast cancer development by upregulating EGFRand subsequently activating the AKT/Skp2 feedback loop pathway. The role of USP18in breast cancer provides a novel insight into the clinical application of theUSP18/AKT/Skp2 pathway.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4387 PMID: 29749454
