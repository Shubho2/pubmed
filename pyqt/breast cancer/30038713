Resistance to EGFR TKIs eventually develops that necessitatesdevelopment of improved and effective therapeutics. CARP-1/CCAR1 is an effectorof apoptosis by Doxorubicin, Etoposide, or Gefitinib, while CARP-1 functionalmimetic (CFM) compounds bind with CARP-1, and stimulate CARP-1 expression andapoptosis. To test whether CFMs would inhibit TKI-resistant NSCLCs, we firstgenerated and characterized TKI-resistant NSCLC cells. The GI 50 dose ofErlotinib for parental and Erlotinib-resistant HCC827 cells was ∼0.1 μM and ≥15μM, respectively. While Rociletinib or Ocimertinib inhibited the parental H1975cells with GI 50 doses of ≤0.18 μM, the Ocimertinib-resistant pools of H1975cells had a GI50 dose of ∼12 μM. The GI50 dose for Rociletinib-resistant H1975sublines ranged from 4.5-8.0 μM. CFM-4 and its novel analog CFM-4.16 attenuatedgrowth of the parental and TKI-resistant NSCLC cells. CFMs activated p38/JNKs,inhibited oncogenic cMet and Akt kinases, while CARP-1 depletion blocked NSCLCcell growth inhibition by CFM-4.16 or Erlotinib. CFM-4.16 was synergistic withB-Raf-targeting in NSCLC, triple-negative breast cancer, and renal cancer cells. A nano-lipid formulation (NLF) of CFM-4.16 in combination with Sorafenib eliciteda superior growth inhibition of xenografted tumors derived fromRociletinib-resistant H1975 NSCLC cells in part by stimulating CARP-1 andapoptosis. These findings support therapeutic potential of CFM-4.16 together withB-Raf targeting in treatment of TKI-resistant NSCLCs.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.25671 PMCID: PMC6049854PMID: 30038713
