Yet, olderpeople commonly underestimate this risk, are less likely to be aware of the earlysymptoms, and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage cancer. Massmedia are a key influence on the public's understanding health issues, including cancer risk. This study investigates how news media have represented age andother risk factors in the most common cancers over time.METHODS: Eight hundred articles about the four most common cancers (breast,prostate, lung and colorectal) published within eight UK national newspapers in2003, 2004, 2013 and 2014 were identified using the Nexis database. Relevantmanifest content of articles was coded quantitatively and subjected todescriptive statistical analysis in SPSS to identify patterns across the data.RESULTS: Risk was presented in half of the articles but this was rarely discussedin any depth and around a quarter of all articles introduced more than one riskfactor, irrespective of cancer site. Age was mentioned as a risk factor inapproximately 12% of all articles and this varied by cancer site. Age was mostfrequently reported in relation to prostate cancer and least often in articlesabout lung cancer. Articles featuring personal narratives more frequently focusedon younger people and this was more pronounced in non-celebrity stories; only 15%of non-celebrity narratives were about people over 60. Other common risksdiscussed were family history and genetics, smoking, diet, alcohol, andenvironmental factors. Family history and genetics together featured as the most common risk factors. Risk factor reporting varied by site and family history was most commonly associated with breast cancer, diet with bowel cancer and smokingwith lung cancer.CONCLUSION: Age and older adults were largely obscured in media representation ofcancer and cancer experience. Indeed common risk factors in general were rarelydiscussed in any depth. Our findings will usefully inform the development offuture cancer awareness campaigns and media guidelines. It is important thatolder adults appreciate their heightened risk, particularly in the context ofhelp-seeking decisions.DOI: 10.1186/s12889-018-5341-9 PMCID: PMC5918870PMID: 29695238
