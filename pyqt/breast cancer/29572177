Nonetheless, variations still exist in thelocal management of patients with spinal metastases. In this study, we aimed toreview global trends and habits in the surgical treatment of symptomatic spinalmetastases, and to examine how these have changed over the last 25 years.METHODS: In this cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing surgery forsymptomatic spinal metastases, data were collected using a secure Internetdatabase from 22 centers across 3 continents. All patients were invited toparticipate in the study, except those unable or unwilling to give consent.RESULTS: There was a higher incidence of colonic, liver, and lung carcinomametastases in Asian countries, and more frequent presentation of breast,prostate, melanoma metastases in the West. Trends in surgical technique werebroadly similar across the centers. Overall survival rates after surgery were 53%at 1 year, 31% at 2 years, and 10% at 5 years after surgery (standard error 0.013for all). Survival improved over successive time periods, with longer survival inpatients who underwent surgery in 2011-2016 compared with those who underwentsurgery in earlier time periods.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical habits have been fairly consistent among countriesworldwide and over time. However, patient survival has improved in later years,perhaps due to medical advances in the treatment of cancer, improved patientselection, and operating earlier in the course of disease.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
