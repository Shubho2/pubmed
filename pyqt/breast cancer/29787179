This chapter briefly describesfour new approaches to anticancer therapy based on boosting the immune systemâ€™sresponse to tumor cells, countering the metabolic adaptations that allow tumorcells to thrive under conditions that kill normal cells, manipulating theincreased oxidative stress associated with the tumor environment, and exploiting the aneuploidy characteristic of many advanced tumor cells. The long-term goal isto devise biomarkers and novel therapeutic agents able to more effectively fight aggressive cancers.PMID: 29787179
