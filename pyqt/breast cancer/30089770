The screening and early diagnosis of breast cancer in high-riskpopulations can effectively suppress its threat to women's health and improvetreatment efficiency, and thus has critical importance. Using various evaluation models, the present study evaluated cancer risk in 35-69-year-old women, and the usefulness of models in breast cancer prevention was compared. MATERIAL ANDMETHODS A total of 150 infiltrative breast cancer patients who were diagnosedwith breast cancer at our hospital were recruited, along with 130 healthy womenas the control group. A retrospective study was performed to collect information.The 5-year risk of breast cancer was evaluated using the Gail and Tyrer-Cuzickmodels. Diagnostic results were analyzed to plot ROC curves for comparing thevalue for screening between Gail and Tyrer-Cuzick models. RESULTS The Gail model has 53.33% sensitivity and 77.69% specificity, with 73.39% positive predictionvalue, 59.06% negative prediction value, 64.64% accuracy, and 0.31 Jordon index. The Tyrer-Cuzick model had 66.00% sensitivity, 86.92% specificity, 85.34%positive prediction value, 68.90% negative prediction value, 75.71% accuracy, and0.53 Jordon index. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.665 for the Gail model(95% CI: 0.629~0.701) and 0.786 for the Tyrer-Cuzick model (95% CI: 0.757~0.815).CONCLUSIONS Both Gail model and Tyrer-Cuzick models can be used to evaluatebreast cancer risk. The Gail model has relatively lower accuracy in evaluatingbreast cancer risk in Jiangxi province of China and the Tyrer-Cuzick model hadrelatively higher accuracy.DOI: 10.12659/MSM.910108 PMID: 30089770
