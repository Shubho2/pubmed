The incidence of these metastases appears to beincreasing, as a result of physicians' greater awareness during follow-upinvestigations of a primary neoplasm. Furthermore, the presence of a greaterproportion of these abnormalities at autopsy should be a triggering factor forfurther investigation for doctors dealing with colorectal oncology. Theirclinical presentation may vary from asymptomatic to signs similar to those ofcolorectal cancer. However, immunohistological analysis is considered thecornerstone for differentiating metastases to the colon, originating from otherprimaries, from primary colorectal neoplasms. Survival reports and treatmentoptions vary. This article concisely presents the main characteristics of thesecondary lesions to the colon from neoplasms that metastasize to the largeintestine (namely, lung, ovary, breast, prostate, kidney, and melanoma) focusing on their incidence, their clinical presentation and the workup investigation.Physicians aware of this uncommon entity are much better prepared to apply anefficient diagnosis and workup, as well as an appropriate treatment strategy.DOI: 10.20524/aog.2018.0244 PMCID: PMC5924850PMID: 29720853
