China.Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug, exhibits anticancer effects which aremediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase(AKT) signaling pathway. However, its use in anticancer therapy combined withother natural products remains unclear. Flavone as the core structure offlavonoids has been demonstrated to induce cell apoptosis without causing seriousside effect. Murine double minute X (MDMX) inhibits tumor suppressor gene p53whose function is associated with the PI3K/AKT pathway. The results presentedherein revealed that the combination of metformin and flavone significantlyinhibited cell viability, and increased apoptosis of human breast cancer cellscompared with metformin or flavone alone. The combination decreased the proteinexpression of MDMX, activated p53 through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway,regulated p53 downstream target genes Bcl-2 apoptosis regulator, BCL2 associated X apoptosis regulator and cleaved caspase3, subsequently inducing apoptosis inMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These results indicated that dietaryflavone may potentiate breast cancer cell apoptosis induced by metformin, andPI3K/AKT is involved in regulating MDMX/p53 signaling. This data suggests thatdietary supplementary of flavone is a promising strategy for metformin mediatedanticancer effects.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7999 PMCID: PMC5840527PMID: 29552226
