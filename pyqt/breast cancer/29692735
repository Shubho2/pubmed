To investigate the potentialcarcinogenicity of MEQ, four groups of Kun-Ming (KM) mice (50 mice/sex/group)were fed with diets containing MEQ (0, 25, 55, and 110 mg/kg) for one and a half years. The result showed adverse effects on body weights, feed consumption,hematology, serum chemistry, organ weights, relative organ weights, and incidenceof tumors during most of the study period. Treatment-related changes inhematology, serum chemistry, relative weights and histopathological examinations revealed that the hematological system, liver, kidneys, and adrenal glands, aswell as the developmental and reproductive system, were the main targets afterMEQ administration. Additionally, MEQ significantly increased the frequency ofmicronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes in bone marrow cells of mice.Furthermore, MEQ increased the incidence of tumors, including mammaryfibroadenoma, breast cancer, corticosuprarenaloma, haemangiomas, hepatocarcinoma,and pulmonary adenoma. Interestingly, the higher incidence of tumors was noted inM25 mg/kg group, the lowest dietary concentration tested, which was equivalent toapproximately 2.25 and 1.72 mg/kg b.w./day in females and males, respectively. Itwas assumed that the lower toxicity might be a reason for its higher tumorincidence in M25 mg/kg group. This finding suggests a potential relationshipsamong the dose, general toxicity and carcinogenicity in vivo, and further studyis required to reveal this relationship. In conclusion, the present studydemonstrates that MEQ is a genotoxic carcinogen in KM mice.DOI: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00361 PMCID: PMC5902691PMID: 29692735
