Immunohistochemistry was used to stain diagnostic biopsy specimens for Ki67, which were scored using the unweighted global method. Conditional logistic regression models estimated the prognostic value of mean and maximum Ki67 scores on BCR risk. Biomarker-fractionation interaction terms determined whether Ki67was predictive of BCR by fractionation.RESULTS: Using 173 matched pairs, the median for mean and maximum Ki67 scoreswere 6.6% (interquartile range, 3.9%-9.8%) and 11.0% (interquartile range,7.0%-15.0%) respectively. Both scores were significant predictors of BCR inmodels adjusted for established prognostic factors. Conditioning on matchingvariables and age, the odds of BCR were estimated to increase by 9% per 1%increase in mean Ki67 score (odds ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.15, P = .001). Interaction terms between Ki67 and fractionation schedules were notstatistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic Ki67 did not predict BCR according to fractionationschedule in CHHiP; however, it was a strong independent prognostic factor forBCR.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).
