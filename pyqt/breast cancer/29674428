Epub 2018 Apr 19.Optimising endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.Yau THL(1), Cheung KL(2).Author information: (1)School of MedicineUniversity of Nottingham, Derby, UK.(2)School of MedicineUniversity of Nottingham, Derby, UKkl.cheung@nottingham.ac.uk.Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is commonly treated with endocrinetherapy (ET); however, over time, cancer cells can develop endocrine resistance. This review aims to document combination therapy and sequential therapy in theuse of endocrine agents and targeted agents, by conducting two systematicsearches using four databases: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web ofScience. A total of 26 studies that covered combination therapy were obtained andincluded for the review. Fourteen were phase III documenting combinations ofmechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K),vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, human epidermal growth factorreceptor 2 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors. The remainingstudies were of phase II nature that reported combinations involving inhibitorsin mTOR, endothelial growth factor receptor, CDK4/6 and TKI. Interesting findingsin inhibitor combinations involving CDK4/6, mTOR and PI3K suggest clinicalactivity that can overcome endocrine resistance. On the other hand, there were 0 studies that covered sequential therapy. Overall findings showed that combinationtherapy improved treatment efficacy over monotherapy in postmenopausal patientswith hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer. Inevitably, the benefitsare accompanied with increased toxicity. To optimise ET, further research intocombinations and effective patient selection will need to be defined.Additionally, this review warrants future studies to explore sequential therapy.Â© 2018 Society for Endocrinology.DOI: 10.1530/ERC-18-0021 PMID: 29674428
