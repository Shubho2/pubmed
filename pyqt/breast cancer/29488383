R. China.A novel fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based platform usingpolydopamine nanospheres (PDANSs) as energy acceptors and dual colored Au NCs as energy donors for simultaneous detection of multiple tumor-related microRNAs withDNase-I-assisted target recycling amplification was developed for the first time.On the basis of monitoring the change of the recovered fluorescence intensity at 445 and 575 nm upon the addition of targets miRNA-21 and let-7a, these twomicroRNAs (miRNAs) can be simultaneously quantitatively detected, with detection limits of 4.2 and 3.6 pM (3Ïƒ) for miRNA-21 and let-7a, which was almost 20 times lower than that without DNase I. Additionally, semiquantitative determination of miRNA-21 and let-7a can also be realized through photovisualization. Mostimportantly, serums from normal and breast cancer patients can be visually anddirectly discriminated without any sample pretreatment by confocal microscopeexperiments, demonstrating promising potential for auxiliary clinical diagnosis.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b05253 PMID: 29488383
