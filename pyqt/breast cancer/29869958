Materials and Methods U.S. Medicare claims from2010 to 2014 Research Identifiable Files were reviewed to retrospectivelyidentify a group of women who underwent screening mammography and a control groupwithout screening mammography in 2012. The screened group was divided intopositive versus negative results at screening, and the positive subgroup wasdivided into false-positive and true-positive findings. Multivariate logisticregression models and inverse probability of treatment weighting were used toexamine the relationship between screening status and the probabilities ofundergoing Papanicolaou test, bone mass measurement, or influenza vaccination in the following 2 years. Results The cohort consisted of 555 705 patients, of whom 185 625 (33.4%) underwent mammography. After adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidities, geographic covariates, and baseline preventive care, women whounderwent index screening mammography (with either positive or negative results) were more likely than unscreened women to later undergo Papanicolaou test (oddsratio [OR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval: 1.40, 1.58), bone mass measurement(OR, 1.70; 95% confidence interval: 1.63, 1.78), and influenza vaccine (OR, 1.45;95% confidence interval: 1.37, 1.53). In women who had not undergone thesepreventive measures in the 2 years before screening mammography, use of thesethree services after false-positive findings at screening was no different thanafter true-negative findings at screening. Conclusion In beneficiaries of U.S.Medicare, use of screening mammography was associated with higher likelihood ofadherence to other preventive guidelines, without a negative association between false-positive results and cervical cancer screening.Â© RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.DOI: 10.1148/radiol.2018172326 PMID: 29869958
