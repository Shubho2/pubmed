Here, weapplied multiple approaches to optimize the potency and selectivity of ourreported alloxazine scaffold. Flexible moieties at position 2 of thehetero-tricyclic system were incorporated to fit into the ATP binding site andextend to the adjacent allosteric site and selectively inhibit protein kinases.This design led to potential selective inhibition of ABL1, CDK1/Cyclin A1, FAK,and SRC kinase by 30-59%. Cytotoxicity was improved by ∼50 times for theoptimized lead (10b; IC50 = 40 nM) against breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. Manycompounds revealed potential cytotoxicity against ovarian (A2780) and coloncarcinoma (HCT116) cells of ∼10-30 time improvement (IC50 5-17 nM). The resultsof the Annexin-V/PI apoptotic assay demonstrated that many compounds inducedsignificantly early (89-146%) and a dramatically late (556-1180%) cell death incomparison to the vehicle control of MCF-7 cells. SAR indicated that5-deazaalloxazines have a higher selectivity for Abl-1 and FAK kinases thanalloxazines. The correlations between GoldScore fitness into FAK and SRC kinases and IC50 against MCF-7 and A2780 cells were considerable (R2: 0.86-0.98).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
