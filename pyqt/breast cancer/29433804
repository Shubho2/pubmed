Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher'sexact, Mann-Whitney, and χ2 tests.RESULTS: There were 913 SVABs performed in 2012 to 2014 for imaging detectedlesions; of these, malignant or high-risk lesions or biopsies resulting in arecommendation of surgical excision were excluded, leaving 395 SVABs yieldingbenign pathology in 395 women. Findings were matched with a control populationconsisting of 45,126 women who had a BI-RADS 1 or 2 screening mammogram and didnot undergo breast biopsy. In all, 191 of 395 (48.4%) women with a biopsy withbenign results and 22,668 of 45,126 (50.2%) women without biopsy returned forannual follow-up >9 months and ≤18 months after the index examination (P = .479).In addition, 57 of 395 (14.4%) women with a biopsy with benign results and 3,336 of 45,126 (7.4%) women without biopsy returned for annual follow-up >18 monthsafter the index examination (P < .001). Older women, women with personal history of breast cancer, and women with postbiopsy complication after benign SVAB weremore likely to return for screening (P = .026, P = .028, and P = .026,respectively).CONCLUSION: The findings in our study suggest that SVABs with benign results donot negatively impact screening mammography adherence. The previously described"harms" of false-positive mammography and biopsy may be exaggerated.Copyright © 2018 American College of Radiology. Published by Elsevier Inc.
