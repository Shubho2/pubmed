Human epidermal growth factor receptor gene-2 (HER-2) positive breast cancer represents about 20% of all breast cancers,1 out of 10 is diagnosed in women over 70 years of age. It tends to be moreaggressive and to spread more quickly than other subtypes, but the introductionin clinical practice of new anti-HER-2 agents combined with chemotherapy hassignificantly improved progression free and overall survival. Elderly patientsare frequently undertreated because of concerns about their age, performancestatus, and comorbidities. Here, we report a case of an octogenarian patienttreated with T-DM1 with brilliant results.PATIENT CONCERNS: An 87 years old woman affected with HER-2 positive breastcancer presented progression of disease with lymph node and skin metastases after3 lines of chemoimmunotherapy.DIAGNOSES: Breast cancer in elderly patient, lymph node, and skin metastases.INTERVENTIONS: Chemoimmunotherapy (trastuzumab emtansine).OUTCOME: Objective response of the disease and significant clinical benefit.LESSONS: This case clearly suggests that age and comorbidities do not alwaysrepresent an absolute contraindication to combined treatments.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000009981 PMCID: PMC5851756PMID: 29489698  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
