This pathway is a criticaltarget for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is predominantly used for colorectalcancer (CRC) treatment. A comprehensive assessment of polymorphisms inFOCM-related genes and their association with prognosis has not yet beenperformed. Within 1,739 CRC cases aged ≥30 years diagnosed from 2003 to 2007(DACHS study), we investigated 397 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 50 candidates in 48 FOCM-related genes for associations with overall- (OS) anddisease-free survival (DFS) using multiple Cox regression (adjusted for age, sex,stage, grade, BMI, and alcohol). We investigated effect modification by5-FU-based chemotherapy and assessed pathway-specific effects. Correction formultiple testing was performed using false discovery rates (FDR). After a median follow-up time of 5.0 years, 585 patients were deceased. For one candidate SNP inMTHFR and two in TYMS, we observed significant inverse associations with OS(MTHFR: rs1801133, C677T: HRhet  = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67-0.97; TYMS: rs1001761:HRhet  = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-0.99 and rs2847149: HRhet  = 0.82, 95% CI:0.68-0.99). After FDR correction, one polymorphism in paraoxonase 1 (PON1;rs3917538) was significantly associated with OS (HRhet  = 1.28, 95% CI:1.07-1.53; HRhzv  = 2.02, 95% CI:1.46-2.80; HRlogAdd  = 1.31, pFDR  = 0.01).Adjusted pathway analyses showed significant associations for pyrimidinebiosynthesis (P = 0.04) and fluorouracil drug metabolism (P < 0.01) withsignificant gene-chemotherapy interactions, including PON1 rs3917538. This study supports the concept that FOCM-related genes could be associated with CRCsurvival and may modify effects of 5-FU-based chemotherapy in genes in pyrimidineand fluorouracil metabolism, which are relevant targets for therapeutic response and prognosis in CRC. These results require confirmation in additional clinicalstudies.© 2018 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/cam4.1407 PMCID: PMC6051204PMID: 29845757
