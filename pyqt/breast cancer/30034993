Chan Schoolof Public Health, Harvard University, Boston MA 02115.(3)Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, SanFrancisco, San Francisco, CA 94158.Purpose of review: In this paper, we summarize prior studies that have usedMendelian Randomization (MR) methods to study the effects of exposures, lifestylefactors, physical traits, and/or biomarkers on cancer risk in humans. Many suchrisk factors have been associated with cancer risk in observational studies, and the MR approach can be used to provide evidence as to whether these associations represent causal relationships. MR methods require a risk factor of interest tohave known genetic determinants that can be used as proxies for the risk factor(i.e., "instrumental variables" or IVs), and these can be used to obtain aneffect estimate that, under certain assumptions, is not prone to bias caused byunobserved confounding or reverse causality. This review seeks to describe how MRstudies have contributed to our understanding of cancer causation.Recent findings: We searched the published literature and identified 76 MRstudies of cancer risk published prior to October 31, 2017. Risk factors commonlystudied included alcohol consumption, Vitamin D, anthropometric traits, telomere length, lipid traits, glycemic traits, and markers of inflammation. Risk factors showing compelling evidence of a causal association with risk for at least onecancer type include alcohol consumption (for head/neck and colorectal), adultbody mass index (increases risk for multiple cancers, but decreases risk forbreast), height (increases risk for breast, colorectal, and lung; decreases risk for esophageal), telomere length (increases risk for lung adenocarcinoma,melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, glioma, B-cell lymphoma subtypes, chroniclymphocytic leukemia, and neuroblastoma), and hormonal factors (affects risk for sex-steroid sensitive cancers).Summary: This review highlights alcohol consumption, body mass index, height,telomere length, and the hormonal exposures as factors likely to contribute tocancer causation. This review also highlights the need to study specific cancertypes, ideally subtypes, as the effects of risk factors can be heterogeneousacross cancer types. As consortia-based genome-wide association studies increase in sample size and analytical methods for MR continue to become moresophisticated, MR will become an increasingly powerful tool for understandingcancer causation.DOI: 10.1007/s40471-018-0144-1 PMCID: PMC6053056 [Available on 2019-06-01]PMID: 30034993
