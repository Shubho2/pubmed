Recently, differential expression of TUG1 was found incancerous breast tissues and associated with breast cancer malignancy features.Although this is evidence of a potential role in breast cancer, TUG1 expressioncould not be associated with different subtypes, possibly due to the small numberof samples analyzed. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and, based onmolecular signatures, may be classified into different subtypes with prognosticimplications. In the present study, we include analysis of TUG1 expression in 796invasive breast carcinoma and 105 normal samples of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and describe that TUG1 expression isincreased in HER2-enriched and basal-like subtypes compared to luminal A.Additionally, TUG1 expression is associated with survival in HER2-enrichedpatients. These results reinforce the importance of TUG1 in breast cancer andoutline its potential impact on specific subtypes.DOI: 10.3390/ncrna3040026 PMCID: PMC5831912PMID: 29657297
