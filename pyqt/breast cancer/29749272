The efficacy of fulvestrant, a selective oestrogenreceptor degrader (SERD), has been demonstrated in hormone receptor positivepatients previously untreated or treated with hormonal therapy. Areas covered:This article discusses the journey of fulvestrant licensing, its efficacy incombination with other endocrine therapies and the future role it may have withinbreast cancer treatment. Expert commentary: Within phase III trials, fulvestrant has demonstrated equivalent or improved clinical efficacy when compared withestablished endocrine agents. In the recent decade, fulvestrant has achievedlicensing as a second line agent in non-operative advanced breast cancer atinitially 250mg, increasing to 500mg. Presently, fulvestrant is licensed globallyas first line endocrine management for advanced breast cancer in post-menopausal women. Early combination trials of fulvestrant and cyclin dependent kinase 4/6inhibitors have demonstrated good clinical efficacy with improved progressionfree survival when compared to fulvestrant alone.DOI: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1473038 PMID: 29749272
