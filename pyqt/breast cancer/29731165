Electronic address: liuwl1314@126.com.BACKGROUND: Encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC) has been considered as avariant of ductal carcinoma in situ. Recent studies suggest that EPC could beinvasive, as it often lacks myoepithelial cells (MECs) at their periphery. Thecurrent study was performed to investigate the biological features of EPC.METHODS: Forty-nine EPC patients admitted to the Tai׳an Central Hospital and QiluHospital of Shandong University from January 2004-December 2014 were included in this study. We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological findings, thepresence and distribution of MECs, as well as the outcomes.RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 68.5 years. The mean tumor size was 2.0cm. MECs were completely absent in all the 49 cases. Most tumors were estrogenreceptor and progesterone receptor positive (95.9%). Human epidermal growthfactor receptor 2 1+ immunoreactivity was seen in only 8 cases. Twenty-fivepatients underwent lumpectomy and 24 underwent mastectomy. Thirty-nine receivedevaluation of lymph node (LN), and 3 (7.7%) patients had LN involvement.Follow-up information was available in 29 patients (8-104 months, mean 47months), among which 5 developed local recurrences and 2 distant metastases.CONCLUSION: EPC is an indolent invasive carcinoma with biological featuresbetween in ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma, with predominance of the latter. EPC rarely showed LN involvement and was characterized by favorableprognosis. EPC can be treated with adequate local therapy and hormonal therapy,whereas the benefit of radiation after lumpectomy remains uncertain.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
