The aim of this study was toinvestigate whether lithium chloride (LiCl), as a mood stabilizer, can affect thesensitivity of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to mitomycin C. The cells wereexposed to various concentrations of mitomycin C alone and combined with LiCl andthe viability determined by trypan blue and MTT assays. Proteins were analyzed bywestern blot and mRNA expression of HMGB1 MMP9 and Bcl-2 were analyzed by RT-PCR.Flow cytometry was used to determine the cell cycle arrest and percent ofapoptotic and necrotic cells. Concentration of Bax assessed by ELISA. Exposure ofthe cells to mitomycin C revealed IC50 value of 20 μM, whereas pretreatment ofthe cells with LiCl induced synergistic cytotoxicity and IC50 value declined to5 μM. LiCl combined with mitomycin C significantly down-regulated HMGB1, MMP9 andBcl-2 gene expression but significantly increased the level of Bax protein. Inaddition, the content of HMGB1 in the nuclei decreased and pretreatment with LiClreduced the content of HMGB1 release induced by MMC. LiCl increased mitomycinC-induced cell shrinkage and PARP fragmentation suggesting induction of apoptosisin these cells. LiCl prevented mitomycin C-induced necrosis and changed the cell death arrest at G2/M-phase. Taking all together, it is suggested that LiClefficiently enhances mitomycin C-induced apoptosis and HMGB1, Bax and Bcl-2expression may play a major role in this process, the findings that provide a newtherapeutic strategy for LiCl in combination with mitomycin C.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
