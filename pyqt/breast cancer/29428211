Radiomics features were extracted fromT2-weighted (T2W) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1+C) images of breastcancer. Radiomics feature selection and radiomics classifiers were generatedusing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysismethod. The correlation between the radiomics classifiers and the Ki-67 status inpatients with breast cancer was explored. The predictive performances of theradiomics classifiers for the Ki-67 status were evaluated with receiver operatingcharacteristic curves in the training dataset and validated in the validationdataset.RESULTS: Through the radiomics feature selection, 16 and 14 features based on T2Wand T1+C images, respectively, were selected to constitute the radiomicsclassifiers. The radiomics classifier based on T2W images was significantlycorrelated with the Ki-67 status in both the training and the validation datasets(both P < .0001). The radiomics classifier based on T1+C images was significantlycorrelated with the Ki-67 status in the training dataset (P < .0001) but not inthe validation dataset (P = .083). The T2W image-based radiomics classifierexhibited good discrimination for Ki-67 status, with areas under the receiveroperating characteristic curves of 0.762 (95% confidence interval: 0.685, 0.838) and 0.740 (95% confidence interval: 0.645, 0.836) in the training and validation datasets, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The T2W image-based radiomics classifier was a significant predictorof Ki-67 status in patients with breast cancer. Thus, it may serve as anoninvasive approach to facilitate the preoperative prediction of Ki-67 status inclinical practice.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.
