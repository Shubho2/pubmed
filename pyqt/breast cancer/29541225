China.Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), an effective component of the traditional Chinesemedicine Chuanxiong Hort, has been proven to exhibit a beneficial effect in anumber of types of malignant epithelial cancer. However, the mode of action ofTMP on breast cancer cells remains unknown. The aim of the present study was toinvestigate the regulatory effect of TMP on breast cancer cells and itsunderlying molecular mechanism of action. Different concentrations of TMP wereused to treat breast cancer cells, and subsequently, the effects on theviability, apoptosis, and migration and invasion abilities were determined. Inaddition, the expression and activity levels of the protein kinase B (Akt)signaling pathway and caspase-3 were explored via reversetranscription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis.The results of the present study revealed that TMP significantly inhibited theviability, migration and invasion rates, and increased the apoptosis ofMDA-MB-231 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The minimum effective dose was~1,600 µM. Additional mechanistic studies demonstrated that 1,600 and 3,200 µMTMP significantly decreased the gene expression and activity of Akt and increasedthe activity of caspase-3. This mechanism may be responsible for the inhibitionof viability, migration and invasion, and activation of apoptosis in breastcancer cells. The results of the present study suggested that TMP may be used in chemotherapy against breast cancer.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7851 PMCID: PMC5835919PMID: 29541225
