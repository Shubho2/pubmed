Although several studies haveindicated that shikonin exhibits antitumor activity in breast cancer, themechanism of action remains unclear. In the present study, we performedtranscriptome analysis using RNA-seq and explored the mechanism of action ofshikonin in regulating the growth of different types of breast cancer cells. The IC50 of shikonin on MCF-7, SKBR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were 10.3 μΜ, 15.0 μΜ,15.0 μΜ respectively. Our results also demonstrated that shikonin arrests theprogression of cell cycle and induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. UsingRNA-seq transcriptome analysis, we found 38 common genes that significantlyexpress in different types of breast cancer cells under shikonin treatment. Inparticular, our results indicated that shikonin induces the expression of dualspecificity phosphatase (DUSP)-1 and DUSP2 in both RNA and protein levels. Inaddition, shikonin also inhibits the phosphorylation of JNK and p38, thedownstream signaling molecules of DUSP1 and DUSP2. Therefore, our results suggestthat shikonin induces the expression of DUSP1 and DUSP2 which consequentlyswitches off JNK and p38 MAPK pathways and causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosisin breast cancer cells.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-21065-x PMCID: PMC5805692PMID: 29422643
