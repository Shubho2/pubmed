Bozpolat@mdanderson.org.Purpose: Recent studies indicated that dysregulation of noncoding RNAs (ncRNA)such as miRNAs is involved in pathogenesis of various human cancers. However, themolecular mechanisms underlying miR-34a are not fully understood intriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).Experimental Design: We performed in vitrofunctional assays on TNBC cell lines to investigate the role of miR-34a inFOXM1/eEF2K signaling axis. TNBC tumor xenograft models were used for in vivotherapeutic delivery of miR-34a.Results: In this study, we investigated the role of p53-driven ncRNA miR-34a and found that miR-34a is associated withsignificantly longer patient survival in TNBC and inversely correlated withlevels of proto-oncogenic eEF2K, which was associated with significantly shorter overall patient survival. We showed that miR-34a directly binds to the3'-untranslated region of eEF2K and FOXM1 mRNAs and suppresses their expression, leading to inhibition of TNBC cell proliferation, motility, and invasion.Notably, restoring miR-34a expression recapitulated the effects of inhibition of eEF2K and FOXM1, the transcription factor for eEF2K and the direct target of p53,in TNBC cell lines, whereas overexpression of eEF2K and FOXM1 rescued the effectsand signaling pathways mediated by miR-34a. Moreover, in vivo therapeuticdelivery of miR-34a nanoparticles by systemic intravenous administration delayed tumor growth of two different orthotopic TNBC tumor xenograft models byinhibiting eEF2K and FOXM1, intratumoral proliferation and angiogenesis, andinducing apoptosis.Conclusions: Overall, our findings provide new insights intothe tumor suppressor role of miR-34a by dual-targeting of FOXM1/eEF2K signalingaxis and suggest that miR-34a-based gene therapy may be a potential therapeuticstrategy in TNBC.
