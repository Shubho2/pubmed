Technological developments in the field of proteomics, and increases in the sensitivity of MS analyses, nowfacilitate identification and examination of increasingly small amounts ofproteins that are differentially expressed in diseased versus normal tissues and can be candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. However, the current approachis for candidate proteins to be prioritized by research interest and thenvalidated one by one; this is very inefficient. To address this issue, we havedeveloped what we refer to as "antibody proteomics technology," which uses aphage antibody library and tissue microarray analysis to rapidly andcomprehensively isolate monoclonal antibodies against candidate proteins for the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In our validationof this technology, we successfully identified oxysterol binding protein-like 5and calumenin as potential biomarkers related to metastasis in lung cancer,annexin A4 as a potential biomarker related to cisplatin resistance in malignant mesothelioma, and Eph receptor A10 as a potential therapeutic target in breastcancer, including refractory breast cancer. These findings suggest that antibody proteomics technology has the potential to become a fundamental technology indrug discovery for the development of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.DOI: 10.1248/bpb.b17-01041 PMID: 29709904
