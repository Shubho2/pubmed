Nonetheless, due to the shortcoming of being expensive andtime-consuming existing in experimental approaches, computational methods areneeded for the prediction of potential miRNA-disease associations. In our study, we proposed a computational model named Heterogeneous Network-based MiRNA-DiseaseAssociation prediction (HNMDA) for the latent miRNA-disease associationprediction by integrating known miRNA-disease associations, miRNA functionalsimilarity, disease semantic similarity and Gaussian interaction profile kernelsimilarity. The Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity can make up forthe shortages of the traditional similarity calculation methods. Furthermore, we applied a heterogeneous network-based method, in which we first implemented anetwork diffusion algorithm of random walk with restart, and then we applied amethod to find the optimal projection from miRNA space to disease space, whichenabled the prediction of new miRNA-disease associations that are notexperimentally confirmed so far. In the cross-validation, HNMDA obtained the AUC of 0.8394, which achieved improvement compared with previous methods. In the casestudies of breast neoplasms, esophageal neoplasms and kidney neoplasms based onknown miRNA-disease associations in the HMDD V2.0 database, there were 82, 76 and84% of top 50 predicted related miRNAs that were confirmed to have associationswith these three diseases, respectively. In the further case studies for newdiseases without any known related miRNAs and the case using HMDD V1.0 databaseas known associations, there were also high ratio of the predicted miRNAsconfirmed by experimental reports.DOI: 10.1007/s00438-018-1438-1 PMID: 29687157  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
