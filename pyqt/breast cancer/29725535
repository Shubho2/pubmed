In thepresent study, genomic evolution was investigated in a patient with stage IVpancreatic cancer bearing a germline breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) mutation. Thepatient received cisplatin, a DNA cross-linking agent, which led to along-lasting complete response. Eventually the patient developed brainmetastasis, suggesting the acquisition of resistance to cisplatin. Hesubsequently underwent brain lesion resection, radiofrequency ablation andchemotherapy, again resulting in long-lasting response. Samples of blood,pancreatic tumor tissue and brain metastases were collected and the extracted DNAwas sequenced. The pancreatic and brain lesions, when compared with the bloodsamples, exhibited mutations in the BRCA1 and checkpoint kinase 2 genes, inaddition to the germline BRCA2 mutation. The brain lesion, when compared with theprimary tumor, harbored no additional mutations or copy-number variations. These findings suggest that the isolated relapse in the brain was due topharmacological sanctuary rather than genomic alterations. It may be suggestedthat the presence of defects in the homologous recombination repair pathways are associated with a good prognosis and clinical sensitivity to agents that damagethe DNA in pancreatic cancer.DOI: 10.3892/mco.2018.1588 PMCID: PMC5920248PMID: 29725535
