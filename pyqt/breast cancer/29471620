This allowsvisualization of internal structures through overlying tissues, thereby providinga virtual transparency vision of surgical anatomy. AR has been applied toneurosurgery, which utilizes a relatively fixed space, frames, and bonyreferences; the application of AR facilitates the relationship between virtualand real data. Augmented breast imaging (ABI) is described. Breast MRI studiesfor breast implant patients with seroma were performed using a Siemens 3T system with a body coil and a four-channel bilateral phased-array breast coil as thetransmitter and receiver, respectively. Gadolinium was injected as a contrastagent (0.1 mmol/kg at 2 mL/s) using a programmable power injector. Dicomformatted images data from 10 MRI cases of breast implant seroma and 10 MRI caseswith T1-2 N0 M0 breast cancer, were imported and transformed into augmentedreality images. ABI demonstrated stereoscopic depth perception, focal pointconvergence, 3D cursor use, and joystick fly-through. ABI can improve clinicaloutcomes, providing an enhanced view of the structures to work on. It should befurther studied to determine its utility in clinical practice.DOI: 10.23736/S0026-4733.18.07659-9 PMID: 29471620
