Dehghani_zohreh@yahoo.com.Pathology as a common diagnostic test of cancer is an invasive, time-consuming,and partially subjective method. Therefore, optical techniques, especially Raman spectroscopy, have attracted the attention of cancer diagnosis researchers.However, as Raman spectra contain numerous peaks involved in molecular bounds of the sample, finding the best features related to cancerous changes can improvethe accuracy of diagnosis in this method. The present research attempted toimprove the power of Raman-based cancer diagnosis by finding the best Ramanfeatures using the ACO algorithm. In the present research, 49 spectra weremeasured from normal, benign, and cancerous breast tissue samples using a 785-nm micro-Raman system. After preprocessing for removal of noise and backgroundfluorescence, the intensity of 12 important Raman bands of the biological sampleswas extracted as features of each spectrum. Then, the ACO algorithm was appliedto find the optimum features for diagnosis. As the results demonstrated, byselecting five features, the classification accuracy of the normal, benign, andcancerous groups increased by 14% and reached 87.7%. ACO feature selection canimprove the diagnostic accuracy of Raman-based diagnostic models. In the present study, features corresponding to ν(C-C) αhelix proline, valine (910-940), νs(C-C)skeletal lipids (1110-1130), and δ(CH2)/δ(CH3) proteins (1445-1460) were selectedas the best features in cancer diagnosis.DOI: 10.1007/s10103-018-2544-3 PMID: 29862464
