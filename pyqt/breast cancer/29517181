A reviewDybkowska E(1), Sadowska A(1), Åšwiderski F(1), Rakowska R(1), Wysocka K(1).Author information: (1)Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW, Faculty of Human Nutrition andConsumer Sciences, Department of Functional Food, Ecological Food andCommodities, Warsaw, PolandOver recent years, there has been increasing interest noted in those activesubstances derived from plants that show potential for preventing cancerdevelopment. The most promising candidate is resveratrol which can be found inlarge amounts in the skin of grapes, tomatoes and in red wine. Its beneficialeffects on the human body are seen both in prevention and therapy. Theanti-carcinogenic action of resveratrol is linked with its ability to neutralise reactive oxygen species and to modulate cellular processes such as apoptosis, andboth cancerous cell proliferation and differentiation. This article presents the characteristics of resveratrol as a bioactive compound derived from naturalsources exhibiting anti-cancer properties, which, because of a wide spectrum ofbiological activities may be used in the prevention of cancer. Many in vitro and animal-based studies have demonstrated such preventative anti-cancer action inthe colon, prostate, breast and lungs. The beneficial effects of resveratrol are also presented when adopted as a support to conventional treatments of cancerusing chemo- and radio-therapy.PMID: 29517181  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
