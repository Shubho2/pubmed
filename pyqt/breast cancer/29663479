It is assumed that no "gold standard" is available. The model is an ordinal regression model with random effects-a so-called rating scalemodel. The model includes case-specific parameters that allow each case his orhers own level (disease severity). It also allows raters to have differentpropensities to score a given set of individuals more or less positively-therater level. Based on the model, we suggest quantifying the rater variation usingthe median odds ratio. This allows expressing the variation on the same scale as the observed ordinal data. An important example that will serve to motivate andillustrate the proposed model is the study of breast cancer diagnosis based onscreening mammograms. The purpose of the assessment is to detect early breastcancer in order to obtain improved cancer survival. In the study, mammograms from148 women were evaluated by 110 expert radiologists. The experts were asked torate each mammogram on a 5-point scale ranging from "normal" to "probablymalignant."Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/sim.7639 PMID: 29663479
