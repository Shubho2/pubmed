Electronicaddress: mkunc@gumed.edu.pl.(2)Department of Pathology, Medical University of Gdańsk, Poland.(3)Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy, Medical University of Gdańsk, Poland.The estrogen receptor α (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PgR) are one of themost important prognostic and predictive immunohistochemical markers in breastcancer. Breast cancers may express various profiles of hormone receptors:ER(+)/PgR(+), ER(-)/PgR(-), ER(+)/PgR(-) and ER(-)/PgR(+). The existence of thelatter profile is a matter of controversy since PgR expressions is induced byER-dependent pathways in breast cancer cells. One of the most extensivelypropagated hypotheses trying to explain the origin of ER(-)/PgR(+) breast cancersclaims that they are technical artifacts dependent on the immunohistochemicalprocedure. On the other hand, in recent years there is a growing body ofevidence, suggesting that such cancers create a unique group with distinctmolecular and clinical features. In the following review, we present backgroundtheories on the ER(-)/PgR(+) breast cancer origin and their epidemiological andclinicopathological characteristics, including the predictive and prognosticsignificance of these rare tumors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
