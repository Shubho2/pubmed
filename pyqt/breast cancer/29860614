Although NHB women are more oftendiagnosed at later stages, it is less established whether racial disparitiesexist among women diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer, particularly when careis provided in the community setting.METHODS: Treatment and survival were examined by race/ethnicity among womendiagnosed in 2012 with stage IIIB-IV breast cancer using the National CancerInstitute's population-based Patterns of Care Study. Medical records werere-abstracted and treating physicians were contacted to verify therapy. Vitalstatus was available through 2014.RESULTS: A total of 533 women with stage IIIB-C and 625 with stage IV tumors wereincluded; NHW women comprised about 70% of each group. Among women with stageIIIB-C disease, racial/ethnicity variations in systemic treatment were notobserved but there was a borderline association indicating worse all-causemortality among NHB women (hazard ratio 1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI)0.96-2.41). In contrast, among women with stage IV disease, borderlineassociations indicating NHB women were more likely to receive chemotherapy (OR1.44, 95% CI 0.90-2.30) and, among those with hormone receptor-positive tumors,less likely to receive endocrine therapy (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35-1.04). All-causemortality did not vary by race/ethnicity for stage IV disease (hazard ratio 0.92;95% CI 0.68-1.25).CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed to identify additional factors associatedwith the potential survival disparities among women with stage IIIB-C disease andpotential treatment disparities among women with stage IV disease.DOI: 10.1007/s10552-018-1045-9 PMID: 29860614
