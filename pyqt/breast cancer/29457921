Ribociclib is an orally bioavailable, highly selective inhibitor ofCDK4/6. In combination with various endocrine therapies, ribociclib hasdemonstrated clinical activity as a first-line therapy for patients with HR+,HER2- advanced breast cancer, without compromising the favorable toxicity profileassociated with endocrine therapy. Thus, ribociclib is now considered a newstandard of care for HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. Areas covered: Thisreview provides a concise overview of the preclinical and clinical development ofribociclib, including evidence of its clinical activity and safety profile whencombined with endocrine therapy in HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. Expertcommentary: CDK4/6 inhibition represents a promising treatment option forpatients with HR+ metastatic breast cancer. Ribociclib significantly improvedprogression-free survival in patients receiving first-line endocrine therapy for HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. Planned and ongoing trials investigatingribociclib in combination with other endocrine therapies and in various clinical settings will help to determine the optimal treatment sequence for differentpatient populations.DOI: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1435275 PMID: 29457921
