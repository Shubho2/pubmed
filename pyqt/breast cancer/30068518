The randomized 2x2 factorial DAMA trial aimed to evaluate whether MBD can be reduced inpost-menopausal women with high baseline MBD by a 24-months dietary and/orphysical activity (PA) interventions.METHODS: We randomized healthy post-menopausal women, attending the Florence(Italy) mammographic screening program, aged 50-69 years, non-smokers, withMBD>50% and no recent hormone therapy, to: a) a dietary intervention focused onplant-foods, with a low glycemic load, low in saturated fats and alcohol; b) a PAintervention combining daily moderate intensity activities and one weeklysupervised session of more strenuous activity; c) both interventions; d) general recommendations. We evaluated changes in MBD based on VolparaTM estimatescomparing baseline and follow-up digital mammograms by anintention-to-treat-analysis.RESULTS: MBD measures were available for 226 participants. An interaction emergedbetween treatments and thus we run analyses by arms. A decrease in volumetricpercent density emerged for women in the dietary intervention (ratio 0.91; 95%CI 0.86-0.97; p=0.002) and in the PA intervention arm (0.93; 95%CI 0.87-0.98;p=0.01) in comparison with controls. No clear effect emerged in the doubleintervention arm.CONCLUSIONS: This intervention trial suggests that a 24-months dietary or PAintervention may reduce MBD in postmenopausal women.IMPACT: A modification of dietary habits or an increase in PA in postmenopausalwomen may reduce MBD. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings forplanning breast cancer preventive strategies.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0468 PMID: 30068518
