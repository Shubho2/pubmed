Antagonists differ from natural GnRH decapeptide in having five ormore amino acid substitutions, whereas most of the antagonists are available assubcutaneous (SC) formula for injection some are formulated as a depotformulation for sustained release (e.g., Cetrorelix, Degarelix). Systemicdelivery of cetrorelix acetate by intratracheal route can be achieved using drypowder for inhalation of the adhesive mixture when the powder deposition reaches stage four. The oral route for systemic delivery of peptide without itsdegradation can be achieved using gastrointestinal permeation enhancementtechnology GIPET® provided by acyline.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email atepub@benthamscience.org.DOI: 10.2174/1567201815666180214142300 PMID: 29446744
