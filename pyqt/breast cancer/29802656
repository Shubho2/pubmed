[Epub ahead of print]Is excision biopsy of fibroadenomas based solely on size criteria warranted?Neville G(1), Neill CO(2), Murphy R(3), Corrigan M(2), Redmond PH(2), FeeleyL(1), Bennett MW(1), O'Connell F(1), Browne TJ(1).Author information: (1)Department of Pathology, Cork University Hospital Group, Cork, Ireland.(2)Department of Surgery, Cork University Hospital Group, Cork, Ireland.(3)Department of Radiology, Cork University Hospital Group, Cork, Ireland.Fibroadenomas (FA) are the most common benign tumor in the female breast. Mostare managed conservatively provided there is clinical, radiologic, and pathologicconcordance. However, surgical excision is typically recommended for cellularfibroepithelial lesions or those lesions with clinical, radiologic, or pathologicfeatures concerning for phyllodes tumor (PT). Some studies have suggestedsurgical excision in all FA >30 mm to reduce core needle biopsy (CNB) samplingerrors. The aim of our study was to evaluate, in the absence of any otherconcerning clinicopathologic features, whether surgical excision of FA waswarranted based on size criteria alone. Cork University Hospital is a largeacademic center in Southern Ireland. Its breast cancer center provides both ascreening and symptomatic service and diagnoses approximately 600 cancers peryear. The breast histopathological data base was reviewed for all CNBs fromJanuary 1, 2010, to June 30, 2015, with a diagnosis of FA that went on to haveexcision at our institution. We excluded all cellular fibroepithelial lesions andthose cases with co-existent lobular neoplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ,invasive carcinoma, atypical ductal hyperplasia, or lesions which would requireexcision in their own right. Cases in which the radiologic targeted mass wasdiscordant with a diagnosis of FA were also excluded. Patient demographics andpreoperative radiologic size and the radiologic target were recorded in eachcase. All radiology was reviewed by a breast radiologist prior to inclusion inthe study, and there was histologic radiologic concordance with a diagnosis of FAin all cases. A total of 12,109 consecutive radiologically guided CNB wereperformed January 2010-June 2015; 3438 with a diagnosis of FA were identified of which 290 cases went on to have surgical excision. Of those 290 cases; 98.28%(n = 285) were confirmed as FA on excision. The remaining 1.72% (n = 5) hadatypical features-FA with LCIS (n = 1), benign PT (n = 3), and invasive ductalcarcinoma (n = 1). Our study suggests that, excision based solely on size is not warranted in clinical and radiologically concordant cases with a diagnosis of FA on CNB.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13069 PMID: 29802656
