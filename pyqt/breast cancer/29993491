[Epub aheadof print]A Time-Reversal Imaging System for Breast Screening: Theory and Initial PhantomResults.Yousefnia M, Zadeh AE, Dehmollaian M, Madannejad A.In this paper a working ultra-wideband (UWB) microwave imaging (MI) system using basic techniques is proposed to detect and localize a tumor model. The systemharnesses the time reversal-DORT signal processing method. We suggest a modified background Green's function and suitable spiral antennas for time reversalimaging of a breast cancer tumor. In this method, scatterings from a breastphantom are measured. Then, reflected signals are processed using thedecomposition of time reversal - known under French acronym DORT- algorithm. In aconventional time reversal (TR) imaging method, free-space Green's function isused for detection. However, in the present method we employ cylindrical Green's functions of a two-layer medium. This makes a better model of the backgroundmedium for TR-DORT imaging. Also, the performance of TR DORT detector againstsignal to clutter ratio (SCR), and its ability to detect and localize differentshapes, sizes, and permittivity values of breast tumor are discussed.Furthermore, a fatty tissue phantom model is used to verify the resultsexperimentally. The MI system is tested to localize a tumor within the breastDebye phantom at the frequency range of 3.1-10.6 GHz. The experimental resultsshow the validity of our proposed system.DOI: 10.1109/TBME.2018.2807799 PMID: 29993491
