Physical inactivity has contributed to a substantial number of deaths (1990: 875; 2015: 2,075) and DALYs (1990: 28,089;2015: 60,585) due to breast cancer in Brazil. Physical inactivity was responsiblefor more deaths and DALYs (~12.0%) due to breast cancer than other modifiablerisk factors (~5.0%). The Brazilian states with better socioeconomic indicatorshad higher age-standardized rates of mortality and morbidity due to breast cancerattributable to physical inactivity. From 1990 to 2015, mortality due to breastcancer attributable to physical inactivity increased in Brazil (0.77%; 95%U.I.:0.27-1.47) and decreased (-2.84%; 95%U.I.: -4.35 - -0.10) around the world. Thesefindings support the promotion of physical activity in the Brazilian femalepopulation to prevent and manage breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29467-7 PMCID: PMC6057969PMID: 30042430
