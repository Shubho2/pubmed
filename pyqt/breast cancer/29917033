Under normal fabrication processes, nanodiamonds are produced with a graphitic carbonshell, but are often oxidized in order to modify their surface chemistry fortargeting to specific cellular compartments. Here, we assessed the biologicalimpact of this purification process, considering cellular proliferation, uptake, and oxidative stress for graphitic and oxidized nanodiamond surfaces. We show forthe first time that oxidized nanodiamonds possess improved biocompatibilitycompared to graphitic nanodiamonds in breast cancer cell lines, with graphiticnanodiamonds inducing higher levels of oxidative stress despite lower uptake.DOI: 10.1039/c8nr02177e PMCID: PMC6034157PMID: 29917033
