Electronic address: barbara.ehrlich@yale.edu.Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS-1) is a highly conserved calcium binding proteinwhich contributes to the maintenance of intracellular calcium homeostasis andregulation of calcium-dependent signaling pathways. It is involved in a varietyof physiological cell functions, including exocytosis, regulation of calciumpermeable channels, neuroplasticity and response to neuronal damage. Over thepast 30 years, continuing investigation of cellular functions of NCS-1 andassociated disease states have highlighted its function in the pathophysiology ofseveral disorders and as a therapeutic target. Among the diseases that were foundto be associated with NCS-1 are neurological disorders such as bipolar diseaseand non-neurological conditions such as breast cancer. Furthermore, alteration ofNCS-1 expression is associated with substance abuse disorders and severe sideeffects of chemotherapeutic agents. The objective of this article is to summarizethe current body of evidence describing NCS-1 and its interactions on a molecularand cellular scale, as well as describing macroscopic implications in physiology and medicine. Particular attention is paid to the role of NCS-1 in developmentand prevention of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
