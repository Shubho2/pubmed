Morphological findings and quantitative ADC wereretrospectively evaluated.RESULTS: Smaller size, round shape, spiculated margins and homogeneous internalenhancement pattern on dynamic MRI were independently associated with establishedpredictors of good prognosis, while larger size and rim enhancement pattern were related to predictors of poor prognosis. A positive correlation was observedbetween ADC value and clinical stage.CONCLUSIONS: MRI may be a useful tool for breast cancer aggressiveness predictionand for guiding subsequent clinical-therapeutic management.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
