We examined the association between total and domain-specific PAand risk of all and site-specific cancer risk.Methods: We analyzed baseline data from Alberta's Tomorrow Project. Specifically, adults ages 35-69 years whocompleted the Past Year Total Physical Activity Questionnaire were included (n = 26,538). For each activity, participants reported the type, duration, andintensity of PA. Total, recreational, and occupational PA metabolic equivalenthours/week were divided into quartiles. Incident cancer cases up to December 2016were identified via linkage to the Alberta Cancer Registry. The associations ofPA on cancer risk were examined using Cox proportional hazards models.Results: A total of 2,186 participants (8.24%) developed cancer during follow-up from 2001to 2016. We observed a significant inverse association between total PA andall-cancer incidence in the multivariate-adjusted model [HRQ4vQ1 = 0.87; 95%confidence interval (CI): 0.76-0.99] that remained significant in the latencymultivariate-adjusted model. Higher recreational PA was associated with a riskdecrease for all-cancer in the latency multivariate-adjusted model (HR = 0.84;95% CI: 0.74-0.96), and showed a linear inverse association with breast cancer.While none of the HR estimates for quartiles of occupational PA and all-cancerreached statistical significance, the model Ptrend was marginally significant in the latency multivariate-adjusted model (P = 0.06).Conclusions: In this cohort ofAlbertans, higher total PA and recreational PA appears to convey modestprotection against the development of all-cancer.Impact: Public health and cancerprevention efforts should focus on encouraging population-level increases in PA.
