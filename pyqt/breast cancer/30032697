The analysis compared two scenarios: treatment options excluding orincluding ribociclib plus letrozole. Market shares were derived from marketresearch and the assumption that the introduction of ribociclib plus letrozolewould only displace existing CDK-based therapies. Treatment duration was based onthe median time to treatment discontinuation or median progression-free survival for first-line treatment, and on clinical trial data for second- and third-linetreatment. Acquisition costs were based on wholesale acquisition costs andconsidered co-payment. Costs for drug administration and monitoring, subsequenttherapy, and relevant adverse events were included.RESULTS: Of 1 million insured members, 263 were eligible for CDK 4/6 inhibitortreatment. Cumulative total savings with ribociclib plus letrozole were $3.01Mover three years, corresponding to a cumulative incremental cost saving of$318.11 per member treated per month.CONCLUSIONS: In the US, ribociclib plus letrozole represents a cost-savingfirst-line treatment option for postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advancedbreast cancer.DOI: 10.1080/03007995.2018.1503484 PMID: 30032697
