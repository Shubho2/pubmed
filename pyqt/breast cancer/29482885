The prognostic value of cytokines and their effect ontumorigenesis remains inconsistent.AIM: To investigate the prognostic significance of IL6 and IL8 and theirassociation with ER and HER2 in estrogen-dependent (ER+) breast cancer.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 79 premenopausal women with early andlocally advanced ER+ breast cancer. All patients received adjuvant hormonaltherapy: tamoxifen alone (56/79) or combination with LHRH agonist goserelin(23/79). IL6 and IL8 serum protein levels were measured by ELISA. Coxproportional hazards regression analysis was implemented for prognosticevaluation of the data categorized based on metastasis outcome.RESULTS: IL6 associated with good (P = 0.001, HR = 0.05) and IL8 with poordisease outcome (P = 0.03, HR = 2.5) in the whole group of patients. Multivariateanalyses highlighted IL6 as the independent prognostic factor (P = 0.001,HR = 0.0007). When patients were classified according to ER or HER2 status, IL6did not have prognostic significance in ERlow and ERhigh subgroups, while IL8retained prognostic significance only in the ERhigh subgroup (P = 0.04,HR = 2.8). IL6 was significant in both HER2- (P = 0.001, HR = 0.05) and HER2+subgroups (P = 0.002, HR = 0.04), while IL8 retained its prognostic significance only in the HER2+ subgroup (P = 0.001, HR = 77.8).CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the clarification of the prognosticperformance of IL6 and IL8 by providing their first prognostic evaluation in the homogenized ER+ breast cancer patient group. IL6 was indicated as a marker offavorable, whereas IL8 was a marker of unfavorable disease outcome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.cyto.2018.02.019 PMID: 29482885
