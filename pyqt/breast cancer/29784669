Thus, discovery of novel therapeutic agentstargeting multiple pathways, such as miRNAs, holds promise for future cancertherapy. One such miRNA, miR-489, is downregulated in a majority of breast cancercells and several drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines, but its role andunderlying mechanism for tumor suppression and drug resistance needs furtherinvestigation. The current study identifies autophagy as a novel pathway targetedby miR-489 and reports Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) andlysosomal protein transmembrane 4 beta (LAPTM4B) to be direct targets of miR-489.Furthermore, the data demonstrate autophagy inhibition and LAPTM4B downregulationas a major mechanism responsible for miR-489-mediated doxorubicin sensitization. Finally, miR-489 and LAPTM4B levels were inversely correlated in human tumorclinical specimens, and more importantly, miR-489 expression levels predictoverall survival in patients with 8q22 amplification (the region in which LAPTM4Bresides).Implications: These findings expand the understanding ofmiR-489-mediated tumor suppression and chemosensitization in and suggest astrategy for using miR-489 as a therapeutic sensitizer in a defined subgroup ofresistant breast cancer patients.
