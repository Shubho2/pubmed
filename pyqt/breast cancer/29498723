Among these gemini lipid formulations, thelipid with an octamethylene [-(CH2)8] spacer (TH8S) showed the highesttransfection efficiency (TE) that was comparable to that of the commercialstandard lipofectamine 2000 (L2K) in terms of luciferase expression in HepG2(liver hepatocellular carcinoma) cells. The addition of the helper lipid DOPE(1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine) with cationic lipids in mixed liposomes further enhanced the TE and the optimized molar ratio was 2 : 1 (DOPE : cationic lipid). The optimized co-liposomal formulation of TH8S (DOPE : TH8S = 2 : 1)showed a higher TE in HepG2, A549 (human lung carcinoma) and MCF7 (human breastadenocarcinoma) cells than other optimized co-liposomal formulations and was alsosignificantly more potent than L2K. The comparison of the TE of DOPE-TH8S (2 : 1)with the gemini lipid T8T (the headgroup devoid of the hydroxyl group) furtherdemonstrated the importance of the hydroxyethyl functionality at the level of theheadgroup. Relatively good binding efficiency and easy release of pDNA (pGL3)were also observed with DOPE-TH8S (2 : 1) in the ethidium bromide (EB)-exclusion and re-intercalation assay, which may be the plausible reason for high TE. Thelipoplexes were also characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamiclight scattering (DLS), zeta potential and small angle X-ray diffractionexperiments. Greater cellular internalization of fluorescein tagged pDNA was alsoobserved with DOPE-TH8S (2 : 1) lipoplexes compared to that with L2K. Retentionof the TE of DOPE-TH8S (2 : 1) lipoplexes under high serum conditions wasconferred by the presence of the tocopherol backbone and also the hydroxyethylfunctionalities. The cellular internalization pathway of the lipoplexes wascharacterized by performing transfection experiment in the presence of inhibitorsof different endocytic pathways and it was found to be caveolae mediated. An MTT based cell viability assay indicated that the lipoplex mediated gene deliveryvectors exhibited low toxicity in all the three cancer cell lines studied.DOI: 10.1039/c7ob02835k PMID: 29498723
