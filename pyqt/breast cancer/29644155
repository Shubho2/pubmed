Here we reportoutcomes from a high-volume institution of patients treated with SBRT forpulmonary oligometastases. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospectivereview of 105 patients who had one to five pulmonary oligometastases (185lesions) without extrapulmonary disease treated with SBRT from 2002-2014. Target failure-free survival (TFFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overallsurvival (OS) were calculated. Univariate and multivariate Cox regressionanalyses were performed on factors predictive of outcomes. Results The median ageat first SBRT was 68 years and the median follow-up was 29.5 months. The mediantime from initial diagnosis of primary to SBRT was 42.7 months; 14.3% hadsynchronous oligometastases and 76.7% had one to two pulmonary lesions at firstSBRT. The distribution of primaries was as follows: 36.2% colorectal, 16.2%head/neck, 9.5% genitourinary, 9.5% sarcoma, 7.6% gynecologic, 6.7% other, 5.7%breast, 5% melanoma, and 4% esophageal. The median lesion size was 1.6 cm and themost common regimen was 60 Gy in three fractions (range: 12-60 Gy in one to five fractions). TFFS was 94.4% and 90.8% at two and three years, respectively.Two and three year OS were 87.9% and 60.2%, respectively. Median PFS and OS were 16.2 and 45.3 months, respectively. In multivariate analysis, age at primarycancer diagnosis and biologically effective dose with an alpha-beta ratio of 10(BED10) were identified as factors significantly affecting OS (p<0.05).Conclusions Comprehensive treatment of pulmonary oligometastases with SBRT in theabsence of extrapulmonary disease results in excellent target control and modest survival outcomes.DOI: 10.7759/cureus.2167 PMCID: PMC5889151PMID: 29644155
