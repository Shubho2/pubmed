Furthermore, we usethe PEG/Collagen IPN platform to investigate the effect of mechanical confinementon cancer cell behavior as it is hypothesized that cells within tumors that have yet to invade into the surrounding tissue experience mechanical confinement. Wefind that mechanical confinement via the IPN impairs behavior characteristic ofmalignant cells (i.e., viability, proliferation, and cellular motility) in thetriple negative breast cancer cell line MDA.MB.231, and is more effective thanremoval of soluble growth signals. The PEG/Collagen IPN platform is a useful toolfor studying mechanotransductive signaling pathways and motivates furtherinvestigation into the role of mechanical confinement in cancerprogression.STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we have developed,optimized, and applied a novel 3D in vitro cell culture platform composed of aninterpenetrating network (IPN) that is both mechanically tunable and inherentlybioactive. The IPN consists of a primary fibrillar collagen type-1 networkreinforced by a secondary thiol-ene poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) network. The IPNsare formed via a novel strategy in which cell-laden collagen gels are formedfirst, and soluble PEG monomers are added later and crosslinked via visiblelight. This approach ensures that the collagen gels contain a fibrillararchitecture similar to the collagen architecture present in vivo. We applied ourIPN platform to study the effect of mechanical confinement on cancer cellbehavior and found that it inhibits malignant-like behavior.Copyright Â© 2018 Acta Materialia Inc.
