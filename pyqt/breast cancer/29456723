China.Novel, non-invasive biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity are criticalfor breast cancer treatment, and prognosis. MicroRNA (miR)-96 has beendemonstrated to be highly expressed in several solid malignancies, includingbreast cancer. However, its expression and function in the metastasis andprognosis of breast cancer have not been fully explored, and its regulationmechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the serum miR-96 expression inhealthy controls, benign and malignant breast cancer types was compared by using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effect ofchemotherapy on miR-96 expression in breast cancer was also investigated. Result revealed that miR-96 expression was increased in malignant breast cancer typesand reduced in patients following chemotherapy treatment. The effect of miR-96manipulation on the migration of breast cancer cells was also investigated byusing wound healing, and Transwell migration assays. These results revealed that the induced expression of miR96 led to enhanced wound closing and trans-membrane cell numbers. By using bioinformatics analysis, western blotting andimmunohistochemical staining, the metastasis suppressor-1 (MTSS1) gene wasidentified to be the functional target of miR-96 in the promotion of cellmigration. In conclusion, it was identified that miR-96 exhibited an increasedlevel in serum samples of patients with malignant breast cancer in comparisonwith benign breast tumor types and health controls and may be substantiallyreduced by chemotherapy treatment, implying that it may be used as a prognosticmarker in breast cancer. miR-96 overexpression may inhibit migration of breastcancer cells by downregulating MTSS1 expression.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7728 PMCID: PMC5795871PMID: 29456723
