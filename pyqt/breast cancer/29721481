Treatment options for MBC depend on several factors. One of these factors is the levels of hormone receptors (HRs) in the tumor. Cancers with high levels of HRs, calledHR-positive, use the hormones estrogen and progesterone to grow and spread.Hormonal therapy is a type of treatment specifically for HR-positive breastcancer. This expert group used data from published literature, practicalexperience and opinion of a large group of academic oncologists to arrive atthese practical consensus recommendations in regards with the use of hormonaltherapy and the management of HR-positive MBC for the benefit of communityoncologists.DOI: 10.4103/sajc.sajc_121_18 PMCID: PMC5909292PMID: 29721481
