China.(2)Department of Oncology, The People's Hospital of Ma'Anshan, Maanshan Shi,Anhui 243000, P.R. China.Association between the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and theexpression of breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was studied. From September 2014 toSeptember 2016, 51 patients with NSCLC who were hospitalized in Department ofThoracic Surgery in The Affiliated Jiangyin Hospital of Southeast UniversityMedical College and underwent biopsy or operation were selected. The pathologicalchanges of lung tissue were detected by hematoxylin and eosin histopathologicalstaining. The fluorescent expression of BRCA1 and RAP80 protein in the two groupswas determined by immunofluorescence staining. Reverse transcriptase polymerasechain reaction method and western blot analysis were used to detect BRCA1 andRAP80 mRNA and protein expression. Then the EGFR gene mutation was detected andanalyzed. The results show that non-small cell lung cancer has an associationwith smoking. Compared with the control, the lung tissue structure of the NSCLCgroup was damaged. The protein fluorescence expression of BRCA1 and RAP80 innon-small cell lung cancer group was significantly increased. The expression ofBRCA1 and RAP80 mRNA and protein in NSCLC group was significantly increased. The difference in expression of BRCA1 and RAP80 in the control and the non-small celllung cancer group was statistically significant (P<0.05). EGFR gene mutationsdetected 14 of the 51 patients with genetic mutations. Non-small cell lung cancerand smoking have certain relevance, and BRCA1 and RAP80 expression in thedevelopment and progression of NSCLC has a close relationship. EGFR mutation innon-small cell lung cancer significantly related to the mutation of EGFR andBRCA1 and RAP80 gene expression plays an important role in the diagnosis andtreatment of NSCLC.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.8938 PMCID: PMC6036334PMID: 30008919
