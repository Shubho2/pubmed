China.Identification of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by surface marker expression andploidy analysis [immunostaining-fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH)] hasbeen shown to be a highly sensitive method in the identification of certain solidcancers. In the present study, iFISH analysis was performed to identify CTCs in184 patients with newly diagnosed non-metastatic breast cancer, and thedistribution of CTC subtypes was characterized based on cytokeratin (CK)expression and ploidy status. It was revealed that CTCs of non-metastatic,aneuploid breast cancers, independent of CK expression profile, can be detectedwith high sensitivity (90.76%) by the iFISH system. Higher CTC counts andsensitivity were observed in patients with increased tumor size burden andunfavorable hormone receptor status. Investigation of CTC subtypes based onploidy analysis indicated that triploid CTCs constituted the majority of CTCsevaluated. While CK-positive CTCs were detected in a small cohort of patients, anoverall low rate of CK expression was observed in the 18 patient samplesevaluated. Of note, CK expression was rare in CTCs detected in patients withHerceptin 2 (Her2)-positive or triple-negative [estrogen receptor (ER)-,progesterone receptor (PR)- and Her2-negative], indicating that lack of ER and PRmay result in promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhancement oftumor aggression.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7540 PMCID: PMC5777306PMID: 29434968
