Using RNA expression profiling, weidentified the membrane protein leucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15) ashighly expressed in multiple solid tumor indications with limited normal tissueexpression. LRRC15 was expressed on stromal fibroblasts in many solid tumors(e.g., breast, head and neck, lung, pancreatic) as well as directly on a subsetof cancer cells of mesenchymal origin (e.g., sarcoma, melanoma, glioblastoma).LRRC15 expression was induced by TGFβ on activated fibroblasts (αSMA+) and onmesenchymal stem cells. These collective findings suggested LRRC15 as a novel CAFand mesenchymal marker with utility as a therapeutic target for the treatment of cancers with LRRC15-positive stromal desmoplasia or cancers of mesenchymalorigin. ABBV-085 is a monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE)-containing antibody-drugconjugate (ADC) directed against LRRC15, and it demonstrated robust preclinicalefficacy against LRRC15 stromal-positive/cancer-negative, and LRRC15cancer-positive models as a monotherapy, or in combination with standard-of-care therapies. ABBV-085's unique mechanism of action relied upon the cell-permeableproperties of MMAE to preferentially kill cancer cells over LRRC15-positive CAFwhile also increasing immune infiltrate (e.g., F4/80+ macrophages) in the tumormicroenvironment. In summary, these findings validate LRRC15 as a noveltherapeutic target in multiple solid tumor indications and support the ongoingclinical development of the LRRC15-targeted ADC ABBV-085.Significance: Thesefindings identify LRRC15 as a new marker of cancer-associated fibroblasts andcancers of mesenchymal origin and provide preclinical evidence for the efficacyof an antibody-drug conjugate targeting the tumor stroma.
