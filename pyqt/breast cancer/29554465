Chan School of Public Health,Boston, MA, USA.BACKGROUND: We present updated features to a model developed by Dana-Farberinvestigators within the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network(CISNET). The initial model was developed to evaluate the impact of mammographyscreening strategies.METHODS: This major update includes the incorporation of ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS) as part of the natural history of breast cancer. The updated model allows DCIS in the pre-clinical state to regress to undetectable early-stage DCIS, or totransition to invasive breast cancer, or to clinical DCIS. We summarize modelassumptions for DCIS natural history and model parameters. Another newdevelopment is the derivation of analytical expressions for overdiagnosis.Overdiagnosis refers to mammographic identification of breast cancer that wouldnever have resulted in disease symptoms in the patient's remaining lifetime(i.e., lead time longer than residual survival time). This is an inevitableconsequence of early detection. Our model uniquely assesses overdiagnosis usingan analytical formulation. We derive the lead time distribution resulting fromthe early detection of invasive breast cancer and DCIS, and formulate theanalytical expression for overdiagnosis.RESULTS: This formulation was applied to assess overdiagnosis from mammographyscreening. Other model updates involve implementing common model input parameterswith updated treatment dissemination and effectiveness, and improved mammography performance. Lastly, the model was expanded to incorporate subgroups by breastdensity and molecular subtypes.CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of DCIS and subgroups and the derivation of anoverdiagnosis estimation procedure improve the model for evaluating mammographyscreening programs.DOI: 10.1177/0272989X17741634 PMCID: PMC5929104 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29554465
