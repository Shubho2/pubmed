Developing a predictive algorithmis key to optimizing HER2-targeting therapy.METHODS: We analyzed 137 pre-treatment tumors with mRNA-seq and DNA exomesequencing from CALGB 40601, a neoadjuvant phase III trial of paclitaxel plustrastuzumab with or without lapatinib in stage II-III HER2-positive breastcancer. We adopted an Elastic Net regularized regression approach that controlsfor co-varying features within high-dimensional data. First, we applied 517 knowngene expression signatures to develop an Elastic Net model to predict pCR, which we validated on 143 samples from 4 independent trials. Next, we performedintegrative analyses incorporating clinicopathologic information with somaticmutation status, DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) and gene signatures.RESULTS: The Elastic Net model using only gene signatures predicted pCR in thevalidation sets (AUC = 0.76). Integrative analyses showed that models containing gene signatures, clinical features, and DNA information were better pCRpredictors than models containing a single data type. Frequently selectedvariables from the multi-platform models included amplifications of chromosome6p, TP53 mutation, HER2-enriched subtype and immune signatures. Variablespredicting resistance included Luminal/ER+ features.CONCLUSIONS: Models using RNA only, as well as integrated RNA and DNA models, canpredict pCR with improved accuracy over clinical variables. Somatic DNAalterations (mutation, CNAs), tumor molecular subtype (HER2E, Luminal), and themicroenvironment (immune cells) were independent predictors of response totrastuzumab and paclitaxel-based regimens. This highlights the complexity ofpredicting response in HER2-positive breast cancer.Copyright Â©2018, American Association for Cancer Research.DOI: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-3431 PMID: 30037817
