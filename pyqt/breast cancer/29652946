In 2005, it was incorporated to the Explicit Guaranties Health System(GES) in Chile. Aim To describe the demographic and clinical characteristics ofbreast cancer patients and to determine the effect of incorporating these womento GES. Material and Methods Medical records of 5,119 women with breast canceraged 59 ± 14 years, attended at six public hospitals between 2000 and 2010 werereviewed. Median follow up was 87 months (range 1-182). Mortality was assessedusing death certificates obtained at the National Identification Registry.Results Sixty six percent of women were in stage I-II, 29% in stage III and 5% instage IV. Surgery was performed in 4023/5119 cases (79%), adyuvant radiotherapyin 3627/4517 cases (80%), chemotherapy in 3,204/3,424 cases (94%) and hormonetherapy in 1,695/2,375 cases (71%). Between 2000 and 2010, there was asignificant increase in the proportion of cases in stage I, from 8% to 25%, (p < 0.01). Overall survival (OS) increased 1% per year, since the beginning of GESsystem (p = 0.024). Five year OS was 75.1%. The figures for Stage I, II, III and IV were 93, 84, 62 and 27% respectively (p < 0.01). Patients without lymph nodeinvolvement and who were not triple negative, had a significantly better OS.Conclusions There was a significant increase in stage I cases, and a 1% per year OS improvement after GES system started, compared with the previous period.DOI: 10.4067/s0034-98872017001201507 PMID: 29652946  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
