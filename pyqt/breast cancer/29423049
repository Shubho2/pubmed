Despite that pharmacologic manipulation of ion channels isrecognized as an important therapeutic approach, very little is known about theeffects of targeting of K+ channels in cancer. In this study, we demonstrate thatuse of the Kv11.1 K+ channel activator NS1643 inhibits tumor growth in an in vivomodel of breast cancer. Tumors exposed to NS1643 had reduced levels ofproliferation markers, high expression levels of senescence markers, increasedproduction of ROS and DNA damage compared to tumors of untreated mice.Importantly, mice treated with NS1643 did not exhibit significant cardiacdysfunction. In conclusion, pharmacological stimulation of Kv11.1 activityproduced arrested TNBC-derived tumor growth by generating DNA damage andsenescence without significant side effects. We propose that use of Kv11.1channels activators could be considered as a possible pharmacological strategyagainst breast tumors.DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget.22925 PMCID: PMC5790466PMID: 29423049
