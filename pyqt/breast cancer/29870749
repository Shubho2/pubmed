Electronic address:xiaofeng.dai@jiangnan.edu.cn.Breast cancers are heterogeneous, with the triple negative subtype being the mostaggressive and lack of effective therapy. Cold atmospheric plasma has become apromising onco-therapeutic approach as demonstrated by many pre-clinical studies.We found from both in vitro and in vivo experiments that plasma-activated medium could selectively induce the apoptosis, inhibit the proliferation and migrationof triple negative breast cancers rather than the other subtypes. We propose thatit is the accelerated genome mutation rate, hyper-activated MAPK/JNK and NF-kBpathways of triple negative breast cancers that make them more vulnerable toplasma treatment than non-triple negative tumors, and MAPK/JNK and NF-κBsignalings in response to reactive oxygen species generated by plasma that playdeterministic roles in this differential therapeutic response. Our workcontributes in establishing a correlation between plasma efficacy and cancersubtypes, which facilitates the clinical translation of plasma as a precisionmedicinal approach.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
