However, the prognostic role of their co-expression in Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) BC has not beeninvestigated so far. The aim of the present study was thus to assess theco-expression (protein and mRNA) of FOXA1 and AR in BC patients, in order toevaluate their prognostic impact according to ER status.METHODS: Immunohistochemical expression of AR and FOXA1 was evaluated on 479consecutive BC, with complete clinical-pathological and follow up data.Fresh-frozen tissues from 65 cases were available. The expression of AR and FOXA1with ER was validated using mRNA analyses. Survival and Cox proportional hazardanalyses were used to evaluate the relationship between FOXA1, AR and prognosis.RESULTS: Expression of ER, AR and FOXA1 was observed in 78, 60 and 85% of casesrespectively. Most AR+ cases (97%) were also FOXA1+. The level of FOXA1 mRNApositively correlated with level of both AR mRNA (r = 0.8975; P < 0.001) and ERmRNA (r = 0.7326; P < 0.001). In ER+ BC, FOXA1 was associated with a goodprognosis independently of AR expression in the three subgroups analyzed(FOXA1+/AR+; FOXA1+/AR-; FOXA1-/AR-). Multivariate analyses confirmed that FOXA1 may provide more information than AR in Disease-Free Interval (DFI) of ER+ BCpatients.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that in BC the expression of FOXA1 is directlyrelated to the expression of AR. Despite that, FOXA1 is found as superiorpredicting marker of recurrences compared to AR in ER+ BC patients.DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4624-y PMCID: PMC6029370PMID: 29970021
