[Epub ahead ofprint]Patient Selection for Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Observation Trials: Are theLesions Truly Low Risk?Patel GV(1), Van Sant EP(1), Taback B(2), Ha R(1).Author information: (1)1 Department of Breast Imaging, Columbia University Medical Center, 161 FortWashington Ave, 10th Fl, New York, NY 10032.(2)2 Department of Surgery, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to report on a study conducted todetermine whether the lesions in patients with what is deemed to be low-riskductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) selected for two large clinical trials are infact low-risk lesions.CONCLUSION: A retrospective review was conducted to determine whether theeligibility criteria of the two trials are predictive that DCIS is low risk. Morethan 20% of lesions are upgraded to invasive carcinoma in patients with low-risk DCIS as defined in two large clinical trials. More accurate methods are needed todetermine whether patients with a diagnosis of low-grade DCIS can be treated lessaggressively.DOI: 10.2214/AJR.17.19244 PMID: 30016145
