HIC can efficiently predict the type of lesion involved in a histopathological image. In general, HIC can aid pathologists inlocating high-risk cancer regions from a WSI by providing a cancerous probabilitymap for the WSI. In contrast, CBHIR was developed to allow searches for regionswith similar content for a region of interest (ROI) from a database consisting ofhistorical cases. Sets of cases with similar content are accessible topathologists, which can provide more valuable references for diagnosis. Adrawback of the recent CBHIR framework is that a query ROI needs to be manuallyselected from a WSI. An automatic CBHIR approach for a WSI-wise analysis needs tobe developed. In this paper, we propose a novel aided-diagnosis framework ofbreast cancer using whole slide images, which shares the advantages of both HICand CBHIR. In our framework, CBHIR is automatically processed throughout the WSI,based on which a probability map regarding the malignancy of breast tumors iscalculated. Through the probability map, the malignant regions in WSIs can beeasily recognized. Furthermore, the retrieval results corresponding to eachsub-region of the WSIs are recorded during the automatic analysis and areavailable to pathologists during their diagnosis. Our method was validated onfully annotated WSI data sets of breast tumors. The experimental results certify the effectiveness of the proposed method.DOI: 10.1109/TMI.2018.2796130 PMID: 29969415
