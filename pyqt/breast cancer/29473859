At our institution,there is no in-house after-hours coverage for breast ultrasonography. We couldfind no peer-reviewed studies on the cost-effectiveness or clinical managementimpact of on-call ultrasound technologist coverage for imaging of breastabscesses. The purposes of this study were to determine the incidence of breastabscess in patients with clinical findings highly suggestive of abscess, identifyclinical factors associated with breast abscess in such patients, and determinethe impact of after-hours emergent or urgent breast ultrasonography on theclinical management of breast abscesses in both outpatients and inpatients. Weretrospectively reviewed 100 after-hours breast ultrasound studies performed atour tertiary care center from 2011 to 2015 for evaluation of a suspected breastabscess. Only 26% of our patients with clinically suspected abscess ultimatelyhad a confirmed abscess. Factors associated with breast abscess were a palpableabnormality and a history of breast surgery within the eight weeks beforepresentation. After-hours diagnosis of an abscess was associated with after-hoursclinical intervention. Of the 74 patients in whom after-hours ultrasound imaging showed no evidence of abscess, only three patients underwent after-hoursdrainage. Our findings support overnight and weekend breast ultrasound coveragein large tertiary care centers.DOI: 10.3390/diagnostics8010017 PMCID: PMC5872000PMID: 29473859
