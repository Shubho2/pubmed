China.Natural compounds derived from plants have been an important source of numerousclinically useful anticancer agents. Nevertheless, limited studies indicate that xanthohumol (XN), a major prenylated flavonoid in hop plants (Humulus lupulus),may possess anticarcinogenic properties. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the antitumorigenic effects and the underlying mechanism of XN on breast cancer in vivo and in vitro. A 4T1 breast tumor mouse model was used in thepresent study to investigate XN suppression of tumor growth as detected bytumorigenicity assays in vivo. In addition, in vitro studies revealed that XNsignificantly decreased cell viability, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest andapoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, as confirmed by an MTT assay, flowcytometry and western blot analysis, indicating anticarcinogenic activity of XNagainst breast cancer. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was performed to confirmthe inactivation of the Notch signaling pathway, Notch 1 and Ki-67, in vivo;consistently, XN caused decreased activation of the Notch signaling pathway andapoptotic regulators B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-extra large and caspase 3, asdetermined by western blot analysis in vitro. This study suggests that XN maypotentially be useful as a chemopreventive agent during breast hyperplasia andcarcinogenesis, acting via the regulation of Notch associated apoptoticregulators in vivo and in vitro.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2017.7434 PMCID: PMC5772922PMID: 29422966
