We present a case of a 47-year-old male patient with a tender breast lump that was noted for 6 months. He was subsequently found tohave a low grade, pure micropapillary and cribriform type DCIS with no evidenceof invasive disease. Current literature does not provide distinct guidelinesregarding management of male breast cancer, and it is currently managed in asimilar fashion to female breast cancer.DOI: 10.1093/jscr/rjy109 PMCID: PMC5960996PMID: 29876051
