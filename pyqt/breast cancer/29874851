In spite of advances in IBCdiagnoses, the prognosis is still poor compared to non-IBC. Due to the aggressivenature of the disease, we hypothesize that elevated levels of inflammatorymediators may drive tumorigenesis and metastasis in IBC patients. Utilizing IBCcell models and patient tumor samples, we can detect elevated NF-κB activity and hyperactivation of non-canonical drivers of NF-κB (nuclear factorkappaB)-directed inflammation such as tyrosine phosphorylatedreceptor-interacting protein kinase 2 (pY RIPK2), when compared to non-IBC cells or patients. Interestingly, elevated RIPK2 activity levels were present in amajority of pre-chemotherapy samples from IBC patients at the time of diagnosisto suggest that patients at diagnosis had molecular activation of NF-κB viaRIPK2, a phenomenon we define as "molecular inflammation". Surprisingly,chemotherapy did cause a significant increase in RIPK2 activity and thusmolecular inflammation suggesting that chemotherapy does not resolve themolecular activation of NF-κB via RIPK2. This would impact on the metastaticpotential of IBC cells. Indeed, we can demonstrate that RIPK2 activity correlatedwith advanced tumor, metastasis, and group stage as well as body mass index (BMI)to indicate that RIPK2 might be a useful prognostic marker for IBC and advancedstage breast cancer.DOI: 10.3390/cancers10060184 PMCID: PMC6025367PMID: 29874851
