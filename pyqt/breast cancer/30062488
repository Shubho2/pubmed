[Epub aheadof print]Second malignancy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): prevalence and overallsurvival (OS) in routine clinical practice.Faehling M(1), Schwenk B(2), Kramberg S(2), Fallscheer S(2), Leschke M(2),Sträter J(3), Eckert R(4).Author information: (1)Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, Hospital Esslingen, Hirschlandstr.97, 73730, Esslingen, Germany. m.faehling@klinikum-esslingen.de.(2)Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, Hospital Esslingen, Hirschlandstr.97, 73730, Esslingen, Germany.(3)Institute of Pathology Esslingen, Esslingen, Germany.(4)Outpatient Cancer Treatment Clinic Esslingen, Esslingen, Germany.BACKGROUND: Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a prior orsynchronous second malignancy are generally excluded from clinical trials.Therefore, little is known on prevalence and prognosis of these patients.METHODS: 1252 patients diagnosed with NSCLC in our center from 2006 to 2017 were studied. Overall survival (OS) of patients with a prior or synchronous malignancywas compared to controls including case-control analysis.RESULTS: 158 patients (12.6%) had a prior malignancy. The most common sites were prostate (17%), breast (16%), gastrointestinal tract (12%), head and neck (11%), bladder (10%), and lung (8%). Compared to controls, patients with priormalignancy were older (71.3 vs. 67.5 years), but had otherwise better prognostic characteristics (stage I-III 63 vs. 53%). Survival was identical compared tocontrols [hazard ratio (HR) 1.017, CI 0.776-1.333]. A further 3.5% of patientshad a synchronous malignancy including 34% prior lung cancer. Patients with asynchronous malignancy had an earlier stage (I-III 84%), and had longer median OSin unselected patients (38.6 vs. 16.2 months, p = 0.021). However, thecase-control analysis showed similar OS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.899, CI0.497-1.621].CONCLUSIONS: Prior or synchronous second malignancies are common at diagnosis of NSCLC. The sites reflect the high proportion of smokers in the population. Theearlier stage of NSCLC with a second malignancy might be attributed to chancefinding of NSCLC during follow-up. The second malignancy does not affect OS ofNSCLC. Therefore, the exclusion of patients with second malignancies from NSCLCtrials should be reconsidered.DOI: 10.1007/s00432-018-2714-5 PMID: 30062488
