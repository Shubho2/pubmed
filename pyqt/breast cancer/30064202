The mean age was 59.4 years(range, 33 to 85), and there were 68 male and 46 female patients. The primarycancer types were non-small cell lung cancer (n=67), small cell lung cancer(n=12), gastrointestinal tract cancer (n=15), breast cancer (n=10), and others(n=10). The number of patients with a single recurring metastasis was 95 (79.8%),and another 19 had multiple recurrences. At the time of the repeat SRS, the mean volume of the locally recurring tumors was 5.94 mL (range, 0.42 to 29.94). Weprescribed a mean margin dose of 17.04 Gy (range, 12 to 24) to the isodose lineat the tumor border primarily using a 50% isodose line.Results: After the repeat SRS, we obtained clinical and magnetic resonanceimaging follow-up data for 84 patients (73.7%) with a total of 108 tumors. Thetumor control rate was 53.5% (58 of the 108), and the median and meanprogression-free survival (PFS) periods were 246 and 383 days, respectively. The prognostic factors that were significantly related to better tumor control wereprescription radiation dose of 16 Gy (p=0.000) and tumor volume less than both 4 mL (p=0.001) and 10 mL at the repeat SRS (p=0.008). The overall survival (OS)periods for all 114 patients after repeat SRS varied from 1 to 56 months, andmedian and mean OS periods were 229 and 404 days after the repeat SRS,respectively. The main cause of death was systemic problems including pulmonarydysfunction (n=58, 51%), and the identified direct or suspected brain-relateddeath rate was around 20%.Conclusion: The tumor control following repeat SRS for locally recurringmetastatic brain tumors after a previous SRS is relatively lower than that forprimary SRS. However, both low tumor volume and high prescription radiation dose were significantly related to the tumor control following repeat SRS for thesetumors after previous SRS, which is a general understanding of primary SRS formetastatic brain tumors.DOI: 10.3340/jkns.2017.0238 PMID: 30064202
