Hieken.Tina@mayo.edu.BACKGROUND: Pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (PLCIS) is an uncommonhigh-grade in situ lesion that shares morphologic features of both classiclobular and ductal carcinoma in situ. Data on the natural history of pure PLCISare limited, and no evidence-based consensus guidelines for management exist.METHODS: From our prospectively maintained institutional pathology and breastsurgery databases, we identified all patients with a diagnosis of PLCIS on coreneedle biopsy (CNB) or excisional biopsy from 2004 to 2017. Patient, tumor,treatment, and outcome data were abstracted to analyze upstage rates andtreatment outcomes.RESULTS: We identified 18 patients with pure PLCIS: 15 diagnosed on CNB, 2diagnosed at operation for atypia on CNB, and 1 diagnosed after excisional biopsywithout preceding CNB. Of the 15 patients with PLCIS on CNB, 3 (20%) wereupgraded to invasive cancer on surgical excision. Overall, 7 patients weretreated with mastectomy (all margin-negative) and 11 with lumpectomy (one with a focally positive margin). Eight patients received adjuvant therapy: six endocrinetherapy, one radiation therapy, and one received both. Among patients with afinal diagnosis of PLCIS, two ipsilateral recurrences were observed at follow-up:one invasive lobular carcinoma at 87 months and one PLCIS at 16 monthspostoperatively.CONCLUSION: PLCIS on CNB mandates surgical resection as 20% of patients may beupgraded to invasive cancer, and outcomes following pathologic margin-negativesurgical resection were excellent with only one invasive recurrence observed.Larger-scale investigation with longer follow-up is needed to define a role foradjuvant therapy and to develop evidence-based treatment guidelines.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6591-6 PMID: 29947004
