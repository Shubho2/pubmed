We analyzed data from 365 premenopausalwomen who came in for screening mammography at Washington University (St. Louis, MO) from 2015 to 2016. Body size at age 10 was self-reported using somatotypepictogram. Body mass index (BMI) at age 10 was imputed using data from Growing UpToday Study. Volpara software was used to evaluate volumetric percent density(VPD), dense volume (DV), and nondense volume (NDV). Adjusted multivariablelinear regression models were used to evaluate the associations between adiposityat age 10 and mammographic density measures. Adiposity at age 10 was inverselyassociated with VPD and positively associated with NDV. A 1 kg/m2 increase in BMIat age 10 was associated with a 6.4% decrease in VPD, and a 6.9% increase in NDV (P < 0.001). Compared with women whose age 10 body size was 1 or 2, women withbody size 3 or 4 had a 16.8% decrease in VPD and a 26.6% increase in NDV, womenwith body size 5 had a 32.2% decrease in VPD and a 58.5% increase in NDV, andwomen with body sizes ≥6 had a 47.8% decrease in VPD and a 80.9% increase in NDV (P < 0.05). The associations were attenuated, but still significant afteradjusting for current BMI. Mechanistic studies to understand how childhoodadiposity influences breast development, mammographic density, and breast cancer in premenopausal women are needed.
