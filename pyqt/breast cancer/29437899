However,its exact role in predicting the clinical outcome of breast cancer remainscontroversial. To comprehensively investigated the prognostic value of CK18 inbreast cancer, a systematically meta-analysis was conducted to explore theassociation between CK18 expression and overall survival. Literature collectionwas conducted by retrieving electronic databases Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Web ofScience, EMBASE, and OVID completely (up to January 1, 2017). Nine relevantstudies with 4857 cases assessing the relationship between CK18 high expressionand the outcome of breast cancer patients were enrolled in our analysis. Theresults indicated that the high level of CK18 expression was significantlyassociated with overall survival of breast cancer patients via aspecimen-depended manner. Reports which used serum to detect the expression ofCK18 predicted a poor outcome of breast cancer (HR = 1.24, 95%CI: 1.11-1.38,P<0.0001), while studies which used tissue as specimen indicated a reverse result(HR = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.60-0.84, P<0.00001). Moreover, overexpression of CK18 washighly relevant to advanced clinicopathological parameters of breast cancer, suchas progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, tumor size,tumor stage, nodal status, and tumor grade. Taken together, the present studydemonstrated that CK18 might be served as a novel biomarker to predictclinicopathological features and the outcome of breast cancer.Â© 2018 The Author(s).DOI: 10.1042/BSR20171145 PMCID: PMC5861326PMID: 29437899
