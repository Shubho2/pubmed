Epub 2018 Aug 3.An update on expression and function of P-gp/ABCB1 and BCRP/ABCG2 in the placentaand fetus.Han LW(1), Gao C(1), Mao Q(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy , University of Washington ,Seattle , WA , USA.INTRODUCTION: P-glycoprotein (P-gp)/ABCB1 and breast cancer resistance protein(BCRP)/ABCG2 are highly expressed in the placenta and fetus throughout gestation and can modulate exposure and toxicity of drugs and xenobiotics to the vulnerablefetus during the sensitive times of growth and development. We aim to provide an update on current knowledge on placental and fetal expressions of the twotransporters in different species, and to provide insight on interpretingtransporter expression and fetal exposure relative to the concept of fraction of drug transported. Areas covered: Comprehensive literature review through PubMed(primarily from July 2010 to February 2018) on P-gp and BCRP expression andfunction in the placenta and fetus of primarily human, mouse, rat, and guineapig. Expert opinion: While there are many commonalities in the expression andfunction of P-gp and BCRP in the placenta and fetal tissues across species, thereare distinct differences in expression levels and temporal changes. Furtherstudies are needed to quantify protein abundance of these transporters andfunctionally assess their activities at various gestational stages. Combining theknowledge of interspecies differences and the concept of fraction of drugtransported, we may better predict the magnitude of impact these transportershave on fetal drug exposure.DOI: 10.1080/17425255.2018.1499726 PMID: 30010462
