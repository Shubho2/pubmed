This study aimed to compare two M.officinalis ethanolic extracts, obtained from leaves and stems, with regard totheir antioxidant activity, total phenolic content, and cytotoxic effects. M.officinalis ethanolic extracts showed a very good antioxidant activity in theDPPH test, correlated with the content in total phenols: higher in the case of M.officinalis from leaves extract (32.76 mg GAE/g) and lower for M. officinalisfrom stems extract (8.4 mg GAE/g). The lemon balm extracts exerted a cytotoxiceffect on breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) even at low concentrations(100 μg/mL), whereas, in the case of healthy HaCat cells, M. officinalis leavesextract only displayed cytotoxicity at much higher concentrations (500 and1000 μg/mL) and M. officinalis stems extracts were highly cytotoxic (starting at 100 μg/mL). In addition, the extracts exerted inhibitory effects on cellmigration and proliferation. These results provide information that confirms the high potential of M. officinalis as a source of chemopreventive agents. Moreover,these data can be considered a solid background for further in vivo studiesinvolving mice bearing breast tumors.DOI: 10.1155/2018/7860456 PMCID: PMC5977058PMID: 29887909
