Epub 2018 Mar 25.Toxicological effects of Camellia sinensis (green tea): A review.Bedrood Z(1), Rameshrad M(2), Hosseinzadeh H(1)(2).Author information: (1)Department of Pharmacodynamy and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, MashhadUniversity of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.(2)Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, MashhadUniversity of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.Many scientific articles proved that green tea (GT), Camellia sinensis, has agreat potential to manage central nervous system, cardiovascular, and metabolicdiseases and treat cancer and inflammatory disorders. However, it is important toconsider that "natural" is not always "safe." Some relevant articles reportedside effects of GT, detrimental effects on health. The aim of this study is toprovide a classified report about the toxicity of GT and its main constituents inacute, subacute, subchronic, and chronic states. Furthermore, it discusses on thecytotoxicity, genotoxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and developmentaltoxicity of GT and its main constituents. The most important side effects havebeen reported hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal disorders specially whileconsumed on an empty stomach. GT and its main components are not major teratogen,mutagen, or carcinogen substances. However, there is limited data in using themduring pregnancy, and they should be used with caution in pregnancy,breast-feeding, and susceptible people. Because GT and its main components have awide variety of drug interactions, consideration should be taken incoadministration of them with narrow therapeutic indexed drugs. Furthermore, theyevoke selective cytotoxicity on cancerous cells that could engage them as anadjuvant substance in cancer therapy.Copyright Â© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.DOI: 10.1002/ptr.6063 PMID: 29575316
