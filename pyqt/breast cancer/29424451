Ultrasound findingswere considered suspicious for metastasis if cortical thickening of greater than 3 mm or effacement of the fatty hilum was present. The false-positive rate ofsuspicious axillary US results for identifying 3 or more positive lymph nodes in the final pathologic examination was calculated. Univariate and multivariateanalyses were used to evaluate imaging and clinicopathologic factors related tothe false-positive results.RESULTS: Axillary US showed a false-positive rate of 60.5% (101 of 167) in thepatients with breast cancer and a heavy nodal burden. By logistic regressionanalyses, we found false-positive axillary US results more frequently in patientswho had a T1 stage tumor (P = .005), an estrogen receptor/progesteronereceptor-negative tumor (P < .001), solitary suspicious nodes identified onaxillary US (P < .001), and a cortical thickness of the most suspicious lymphnode of 3.5 mm or less (P = .015).CONCLUSIONS: Imaging and clinicopathologic features can be used to identifyaxillae with less than 3 metastatic nodes in patients with early-stage breastcancer who have positive axillary US results. In the post-American College ofSurgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial era, conducting a secondary evaluation eitherclinically or by axillary imaging before the use of a US-guided biopsy ofsuspicious nodes can potentially avoid the additional morbidity of axillary lymphnode dissection and reduce the preoperative workload.© 2018 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/jum.14545 PMID: 29424451
