In Mexico, it has been reported that 14.5% of adult women have sometype of thyroid dysfunction and abnormalities in thyroid function tests have beenobserved in a variety of non-thyroidal illnesses, including breast cancer (BC).These abnormalities might change with body mass index (BMI) because thyroidhormones are involved in the regulation of various metabolic pathways andprobably by menopausal status because obesity has been negatively associated withBC in premenopausal women and has been positively associated with BC inpostmenopausal women.METHODS: To assess the association between serum thyroid hormone concentration(T4 and T3) and BC and the influence of obesity as an effect modifier of thisrelationship in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, we measured serum thyroidhormone and thyroid antibody levels in 682 patients with incident breast cancer(cases) and 731 controls, who participated in a population-based case-controlstudy performed from 2004 to 2007 in three states of Mexico. We tested theassociation of total T4 (TT4) and total T3 (TT3) stratifying by menopausal statusand body mass index (BMI), and adjusted for other health and demographic riskfactors using logistic regressions models.RESULTS: Higher serum total T4 (TT4) concentrations were associated with BC inboth premenopausal (odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation = 5.98, 95% CI3.01-11.90) and postmenopausal women (OR per standard deviation = 2.81, 95% CI2.17-3.65). In premenopausal women, the effect of TT4 decreased as BMI increased while the opposite was observed in postmenopausal women. The significance of the effect modification was marginal (p = 0.059) in postmenopausal women and was not significant in premenopausal women (p = 0.22). Lower TT3 concentrations wereassociated with BC in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women and no effectmodification was observed.CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association between BC and serum concentrations ofTT3 and TT4; this needs to be further investigated to understand why it happensand how important it is to consider these alterations in treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1017-8 PMID: 30092822
