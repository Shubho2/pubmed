We investigated the survival experience of people diagnosed with breast (BC) or colorectal (CRC) cancer from 2005 to2014.METHODS: Data included 1360 BC cases (median age 55.1 years) and 722 CRC cases(median age: 59.5 years; 52.5% men) recorded by the Gaza Cancer Registryaccording to a standard protocol. Clinical information was available for casesdiagnosed in 2005-2006 only. Survival probabilities were estimated byKaplan-Meyer method, while hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI),adjusted for age and sex, were computed to assess factors associated with therisk of death.RESULTS: Five-year survival was 65.1% for women with BC and 50.2% for patientswith CRC. Advanced age (> 65 years), stage, and grade increased the death risk.Full access to therapies was associated with a reduced risk of death as compared with patients who had limited access (HR = 0.26, 95% CI:0.13-0.51 for BC; andHR = 0.11, 95% CI:0.04-0.31 for CRC).CONCLUSION(S): The 5-year survival after BC or CRC in the Gaza Strip was in line with estimates from surrounding Arab countries, but it was much lower than indeveloped Mediterranean countries (e.g., in Italy or in Jewish people in Israel).DOI: 10.1186/s12885-018-4552-x PMCID: PMC5987449PMID: 29866055
