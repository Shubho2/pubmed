The immunohistochemical expression of BRCA1 was studied andrelated with expression of ER, PR, and HER-2/neu on their trucut biopsies.Results: The altered expression of BRCA1 (i.e., reduced or absent expression) wasseen in 44.4% cases of breast carcinoma while 55.6% had positive expression.About 83% of breast carcinomas with altered BRCA1 expression were larger than 3cm in size. The breast carcinomas showing altered expression were found to bemostly high grade (63.6%). This was statistically significant. The ER and PRnegativity were seen in 62.5% and 79.2% breast carcinomas with altered BRCA1expression, respectively. The score 3 positivity of HER-2/neu was more commonamong carcinomas with altered BRCA1 expression (21% vs. 16.7%). The triplenegativity was found in 41.7% breast carcinomas having altered BRCA1 expression. This was statistically significant.Conclusion: The combination of immunohistochemical expression of BRCA1, ER, PR,and HER-2/neu and clinicopathological details may be helpful in predicting theindividuals more likely to carry BRCA1 mutations and thus selecting the candidateand family members for genetic screening for BRCA1 mutations.DOI: 10.4103/IJPM.IJPM_393_16 PMID: 29567881
