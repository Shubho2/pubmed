The median age at breast cancer diagnosiswas 47 years (range 21-73 years).RESULTS: The median survival after BM was 16.2 months (range 12.1-20.3 months),and the survival rates were 62% and 37% at 1 and 2 years, respectively.Multivariate analysis showed that craniotomy (p = 0.034) and targeted therapy(p < 0.001) for BCBM were positively correlated with survival after diagnosis of BM; radiotherapy (p = 0.024) after surgery for primary breast cancer wasbeneficial to BM.CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection and targeted therapy are effective treatment for BCBM. Radiotherapy after surgery for the management of primary breast cancer isnecessary in patients with brain progression later.Copyright © 2018.
