This is carried out via the regulation of both the influx from theextracellular environment and the recycling of intracellular resources. Sinceepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, includinggefitinib (GEF) have been reported to induce the apoptosis of several cancer celllines, in the present study, we examined whether the cytotoxic effects of GEF arefurther enhanced under amino acid starvation (AAS) culture conditions. Under AAS culture conditions, the cell killing effect of GEF was synergistically pronouncedin the EGFR-expressing cell lines, namely, CAL 27, Detroit 562, A549 and PANC-1cells compared with those treated with either GEF or AAS alone. The addition ofessential amino acids, but not non-essential amino acids to the cell culturemedium resulted in the cancellation of this pronounced cytotoxicity. Theknockdown of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT-1) by siRNA also enhancedGEF-induced cytotoxicity. Therefore, the shortage of the intracellular amino acidpool appears to determine the sensitivity to GEF. Notably, this enhancedcytotoxicity is not mediated by the induction of apoptosis, but is accompanied bythe pronounced induction of autophagy. The presence of necrostatin-1, aninhibitor of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPKâ€‘1), butnot that of Z-VAD-fmk, attenuated the cytotoxic effects of GEF under AAS culture conditions. Electron microscopy demonstrated that the CAL 27 cells treated withGEF under AAS culture conditions exhibited swelling of the cytosol and organelleswith an increased number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, but withoutchromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Autophagic cell death wasexcluded as the inhibition of autophagy did not attenuate the cytotoxicity. Theseresults strongly suggest the induction of necroptosis in response to GEF underAAS culture conditions. However, we could not detect any phosphorylation ofRIPK-1 and mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL), as well as anynecrosome formation. Therefore, the enhanced cytotoxic effect of GEF under AASculture conditions is thought to be mediated by atypical necroptosis.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4282 PMCID: PMC5843391PMID: 29484439
