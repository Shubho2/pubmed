[Epub ahead of print]Seminoma with Neoplastic Meningitis Treated with Craniospinal Irradiation.Sinicrope KD(1), Kaplan AB(2), Brastianos PK(3)(4).Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston,Massachusetts, USA kduerfeldt@partners.org.(2)The Stephen E. and Catherine Pappas Center for Neuro-Oncology, MassachusettsGeneral Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.(3)Divisions of Hematology/Oncology and Neuro-Oncology, Massachusetts GeneralHospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.(4)Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.Pure seminoma is a histological subtype of testicular cancer that accounts for50% of testicular germ cell tumors. It has a very low rate of metastasis to thecentral nervous system, with only one previously reported case of neoplasticmeningitis (cancer that has spread to the cerebrospinal fluid). Traditionally,neoplastic meningitis has an ominous prognosis when associated with primarytumors that commonly spread to the leptomeninges, like breast and lung. Thisarticle highlights a unique case of pure seminoma with neoplastic meningitis and illustrates the effectiveness of craniospinal irradiation as a treatmentmodality.Â© AlphaMed Press 2018.DOI: 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0223 PMID: 30012875
