Toaddress this problem, it is better to simultaneously consider multiple factors insensitivity and specificity assays.Methods: In this study, a dataset for 105 breast cancer patients (84 disease-freeand 21 progressing) were chosen. Individual and cumulative receiver operatingcharacteristics (ROC) were used to analyze the impact of each factor along withinteraction effects.Results: In individual ROC analysis, only 3 of 13 factors showed betterperformance for area under curve (AUC), i.e., AUC > 7 for hormone therapy (HT),tissue visfatin, and lymph node (LN) metastasis. Under our proposed scoringsystem, the cumulative ROC analysis provides higher AUC performance (0.746-0.886)than individual ROC analysis in predicting breast cancer progression. Consideringthe interaction between these factors, a minimum of six factors, including HT,tissue visfatin, LN metastasis, tumor stage, age, and tumor size, were identifiedas being highly interactive and associated with breast cancer progression,providing potential and optimal discriminators for predicting breast cancerprogression.Conclusion: Taken together, the cumulative ROC analysis provides betterprediction for breast cancer progression than individual ROC analysis.DOI: 10.1186/s12935-018-0517-z PMCID: PMC5807850PMID: 29449787
