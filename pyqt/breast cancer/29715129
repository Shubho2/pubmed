For 8,191 outside SP cases reviewed,the overall discordance rate (DR) was 14.2% (2.2% major, 12.0% minor).Specifically, neuropathology had the highest DR (10.9%), cutaneous and breast thelowest (1.1% each). Among 1,098 CP cases, the total DR was 13.7% (3.0% major,10.7% minor). The majority of CP cases (1,066) were non-gynecological and had atotal DR of 13.4% (2.7% major, 10.7% minor).CONCLUSION: While major DR was low, certain subspecialties had high DRs. Thisproject can help identify areas where focused education could help improvepathological diagnostic accuracy for cancer.CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.Delinasios), All rights reserved.DOI: 10.21873/anticanres.12551 PMID: 29715129  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
