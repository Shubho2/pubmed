The MUC1-Concoprotein is aberrantly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)cells, induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promotesanti-cancer drug resistance. The present study demonstrates that targeting MUC1-Cgenetically and pharmacologically in TNBC cells results in the downregulation of BCL2A1 expression. The results show that MUC1-C activates the BCL2A1 gene by anNF-κB p65-mediated mechanism, linking this pathway with the induction of EMT. TheMCL-1 anti-apoptotic protein is also of importance for the survival of TNBC cellsand is an attractive target for drug development. We found that inhibiting MCL-1 with the highly specific MS1 peptide results in the activation of theMUC1-C→NF-κB→BCL2A1 pathway. In addition, selection of TNBC cells for resistance to ABT-737, which inhibits BCL-2, BCL-xL and BCL-W but not MCL-1 or BCL2A1, isassociated with the upregulation of MUC1-C and BCL2A1 expression. TargetingMUC1-C in ABT-737-resistant TNBC cells suppresses BCL2A1 and induces death, whichis of potential therapeutic importance. These findings indicate that MUC1-C is a target for the treatment of TNBCs unresponsive to agents that inhibitanti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 family.DOI: 10.1038/s41392-018-0013-x PMCID: PMC5948210PMID: 29760958
