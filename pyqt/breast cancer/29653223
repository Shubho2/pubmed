However, owing to their cationic chargeand non-specificity characteristics, the clinical application of CPPs is limited.In the current study, we engineered a reversibly activatable cell-penetratingpeptide (RACPP), containing oligoarginine fused to a pH-sensitive maskingsequence via a polyglycine linker ((HE)10G5R6 or HE-CPP) withultra-pH-sensitivity. The HE-CPP sequence was coupled to the surface ofpolyethyleneglycol-polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) polymer micelles (PMs-HE-CPP) torealize improve specificity and targeted delivery of encapsulated paclitaxel(PTX). PTX/PMs-HE-CPP showed the satisfactory encapsulated efficiency, loadingcapacity, size distribution as well as reversible charge-conversion in responseto the surrounding pH. The zeta potential of PMs-HE-CPP was negative at pH 7.5,moderately positive at pH 6.5, and even more positive at a lower pH. Coumarin6-loaded PMs-HE-CPP (C6/PMs-HE-CPP) showed enhanced tumor cellular uptake at amildly acidic tumor microenvironment (pH 6.5) via energy-dependent andclathrin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, PTX/PMs-HE-CPP had significantlyhigher cytotoxicity toward mice breast cancer (4T1) cells at pH 6.5 versus atpH 7.4. In vivo imaging studies in 4T1-BALB/c tumor xenograft models confirmedthe tumor-targeting characteristic of PMs-HE-CPP. PTX/PMs-HE-CPP also exhibitedimproved anti-tumor efficacy against unmodified polymer micelles and Taxol® inthis tumor model. Accordingly, not only do RACPPs show the great potential toendow CPPs with specificity and reversible net-charge converting characteristic, they are also able to improve the targeting effect of nanoparticles.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
