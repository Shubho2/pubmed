China.MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are highly conserved small noncoding RNA moleculesinvolved in gene regulation. An increasing number of studies have demonstratedthat miRNAs act as oncogenes or antioncogenes in various types of cancer,including breast cancer (BC). However, the exact role of miR‑671‑3p in BC has notyet been reported. In the present study, in vitro experiments were implemented toexplore the effects of miR‑671‑3p on the proliferation and apoptosis of BC cells,and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was conductedusing in‑house clinical BC samples to address the expression level and clinicalvalue of miR‑671‑3p in BC. Simultaneously, miR‑671‑3p target genes werecollected, and subsequent bioinformatics analyses were executed to probe thepotential signaling pathway through which miR‑671‑3p influenced the occurrenceand progression of BC. According to the results, the expression level ofmiR‑671‑3p was lower in BC tissues compared with that in adjacent non‑tumoroustissues (P=0.048), and the area under the curve was 0.697 (95% confidenceinterval=0.538‑0.856), with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.818 and 0.579,respectively. Forced miR‑671‑3p expression in the BC cell line MDA‑MB‑231evidently arrested cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore,in silico enrichment analyses suggested that miR‑671‑3p may be involved in theinitiation and progression of BC through the targeting of genes associated withthe Wnt signaling pathway. In conclusion, the present study findings suggestedthat miR‑671‑3p may function as a tumor suppressor in BC by influencing the Wntsignaling cascade, which provides a prospective molecular target for the therapy of BC.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4339 PMCID: PMC5919715PMID: 29620195
