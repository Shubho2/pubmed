Its anticanceractivities are well explored, and recently a partially purified cytotoxic proteinfraction termed F5 from the mushroom's sclerotial cold water extract consistingmainly of fungal serine proteases was found to exhibit potent selectivecytotoxicity against a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF7) with IC50value of 3.00 Î¼g/ml. However, characterization of its cell death-inducingactivity has yet to be established.Methods: The mechanism involved in the cytotoxic activities of F5 against MCF7cells was elucidated by flow cytometry-based apoptosis detection, caspasesactivity measurement, and expression profiling of apoptosis markers by westernblotting. Molecular attributes of F5 were further mined from L. rhinocerus'spublished genome and transcriptome for future exploration.Results and Discussion: Apoptosis induction in MCF7 cells by F5 may involve across-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways withupregulation of caspase-8 and -9 activities and a marked decrease of Bcl-2. Onthe other hand, the levels of pro-apoptotic Bax, BID, and cleaved BID wereincreased accompanied by observable actin cleavage. At gene level, F5 composed ofthree predicted non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (T > C) and analternative 5' splice site.Conclusions: Findings from this study provide an advanced framework for furtherinvestigations on cancer therapeutics development from L. rhinocerus.DOI: 10.7717/peerj.4940 PMCID: PMC5993024PMID: 29888137
