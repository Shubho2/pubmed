In the present work, wecharacterize the development of nitric oxide (NO) deficiency and markers ofendothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in the lung in relation to theprogression of 4T1 metastatic breast cancer injected orthotopically in mice.METHODS: NO production, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation status, markers of EndMT in the lung, pulmonary endothelium permeability, andplatelet activation/reactivity were analyzed in relation to the progression of4T1 breast cancer metastasis to the lung, as well as to lung tissue remodeling,1-5 weeks after 4T1 cancer cell inoculation in Balb/c mice.RESULTS: Phosphorylation of eNOS and NO production in the lungs of 4T1 breastcancer-bearing mice was compromised prior to the development of pulmonarymetastasis, and was associated with overexpression of Snail transcription factor in the pulmonary endothelium. These changes developed prior to the mesenchymalphenotypic switch in the lungs evidenced by a decrease in vascularendothelial-cadherin (VE-CAD) and CD31 expression, and the increase in pulmonary endothelial permeability, phenomena which coincided with early pulmonarymetastasis. Increased activation of platelets was also detected prior to theearly phase of metastasis and persisted to the late phase of metastasis, asevidenced by the higher percentage of unstimulated platelets binding fibrinogenwithout changes in von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen binding in response toADP stimulation.CONCLUSIONS: Decreased eNOS activity and phosphorylation resulting in a low NOproduction state featuring pulmonary endothelial dysfunction was an early eventin breast cancer pulmonary metastasis, preceding the onset of its phenotypicswitch toward a mesenchymal phenotype (EndMT) evidenced by a decrease in VE-CADand CD31 expression. The latter coincided with development of the firstmetastatic nodules in the lungs. These findings suggest that early endothelialdysfunction featured by NO deficiency rather than EndMT, might represent aprimary regulatory target to prevent early pulmonary metastasis.DOI: 10.1186/s13058-018-1013-z PMID: 30075800
