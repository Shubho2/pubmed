[Epub ahead ofprint]Intraoperative Injection of 99m-Tc Sulfur Colloid for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy:Can the Preoperative Injection Procedure be Eliminated?Williams JS(1)(2), Lalchandani P(1)(2), Moazzez A(1)(2), Ozao-Choy J(1)(2),Dauphine C(3)(4).Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA, USA.(2)Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, Torrance, CA, USA.(3)Department of Surgery, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA, USA.cdauphine@dhs.lacounty.gov.(4)Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, Torrance, CA, USA.cdauphine@dhs.lacounty.gov.BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) historically involves a separateappointment in the Radiology Department to undergo injection of the radiocolloid tracer (RT) the day of, or prior to, surgery, which can lead to disruptions inscheduling. Furthermore, the patient must endure an additional procedure. In apilot study, intraoperative injection of the RT was previously shown to beequally as effective as preoperative injection. This study evaluates the efficacyof this method in a large cohort and examines factors associated with failure of the RT to reach the axilla.METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who underwent SLNB between June 2010 and June 2017 was performed. All patients were injected immediately followingintubation with sulfur colloid and blue dye, unless contraindicated. Operativerecords were reviewed to determine whether sentinel nodes were identified and if gamma counts were detected. Patient and tumor characteristics were examined toidentify factors related to failed RT uptake in the axilla.RESULTS: In 7Â years, 453 SLNBs were performed, with sentinel nodes being detectedin 447 (98.7%) of these SLNBs. In the six cases where no nodes were detected, allhad a prior ipsilateral axillary procedure. Sentinel nodes were undetectable withthe gamma probe in 16 (3.5%) cases; a prior axillary procedure was the onlystatistically significant independent variable associated with this failure.CONCLUSION: Intraoperative injection of the RT is highly effective in thedetection of sentinel nodes in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients.Eliminating the need for a preoperative injection of RT can avoid schedulingconflicts and decrease patient morbidity.DOI: 10.1245/s10434-018-6594-3 PMID: 29956093
