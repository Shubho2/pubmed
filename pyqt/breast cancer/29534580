MTDH promotes breast cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis through the activation of numerous signalingpathways. Currently, the mecha- nism regulating MTDH expression is poorlyunderstood. Here we identified that FBXW7, a component of E3 ubiquitin ligase,targets MTDH for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Forced overexpression of FBXW7could decrease the level of MTDH protein, and inhibition of endogenous FBXW7expression remarkably increases the MTDH protein abundance. More importantly,overexpression of FBXW7 could lead to proliferation arrest and apoptosis inbreast cancer cells through targeting MTDH degradation. These data suggest thatFBXW7, a tumor suppressor, inhibits breast cancer cell prolifera- tion andpromotes apoptosis at least partially through targeting MTDH for proteolysis.This new regulatory mechanism of MTDH by FBXW7 represents a new pathway formalignant phenotype turnover in human breast cancer.DOI: 10.4149/neo_2018_170228N149 PMID: 29534580
