Littleis known about the molecular alterations occurring in the tissue microenvironmentduring NTM pathogenesis. Utilizing next generation sequencing, we sequencedsputum and matched lymphocyte DNA in 15 MAC patients for a panel of 19 genesknown to harbor cancer susceptibility associated mutations. Thirteen of 15 NTMsubjects had a diagnosis of breast cancer (BCa) before or after NTM infection.Thirty three percent (4/12) of these NTM-BCa cases exhibited at least 3 somaticmutations in sputa compared to matched lymphocytes. Twenty four somatic mutationswere detected with at least one mutation in ATM, ERBB2, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, AR, TP53, PALB2, CASP8, BRIP1, NBN and TGFB1 genes. All four NTM-BCa patientsharboring somatic mutations also exhibited 15 germ line BRCA1 and BRCA2mutations. The two NTM subjects without BCa exhibited twenty somatic mutationsspanning BRCA1, BRCA1, BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK2, ERBB2, TP53, ATM, PALB2, TGFB1 and 3 germ line mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. A single copy loss of STK11 and AR gene was noted in NTM-BCa subjects. Periodic screening of sputa may aid todevelop risk assessment biomarkers for neoplastic diseases in NTM patients.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-29471-x PMCID: PMC6063893PMID: 30054559
