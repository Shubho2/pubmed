Recently, therehas been much interest in RNA interference-mediated treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. In the present study, we have developed lipid nanoparticlesencapsulating siRNA (LNP-siRNA) decorated with an Fab' antibody againstheparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (αHB-EGF LNP-siRNA). αHB-EGF LNP-siRNAtargeting polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) was prepared and evaluated for its anticancereffect using MDA-MB-231 human triple-negative breast cancer cells overexpressing HB-EGF on their cell surface. Biodistribution data of radioisotope-labeled LNPand fluorescence-labeled siRNA indicated that αHB-EGF LNP effectively deliveredsiRNA to tumor tissue in MDA-MB-231 carcinoma-bearing mice. Expression of PLK1protein in the tumors was clearly suppressed after intravenous injection ofαHB-EGF LNP-siPLK1. In addition, tumor growth was significantly inhibited bytreatment with this formulation of siRNA and an antibody-modified carrier. These findings indicate that αHB-EGF LNP is a promising carrier for the treatment ofHB-EGF-expressing cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer.DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01055 PMID: 29502423
