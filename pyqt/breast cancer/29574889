To pursue complete excisions,radioactive seed localization (RSL) may be used to insert an iodine-125 seed intothe tumor. The seed is used as a marker for the location of the tumor duringsurgery. RSL does not, however, show the extent of the tumor. Based on RSL, wepursue to visualize the seed location together with the extent from diagnosticimages.METHODS: A system with two gamma-camera heads and two parallel-hole collimatorswas recently proposed to triangulate the location of an iodine-125 seed duringBCS. In the present study, this system was extended with a range camera tovisualize a sphere centered on the seed in relation to the breast. This spherecontains the entire tumor and thus defines the target volume for BCS. Physicalexperiments with acrylic block phantoms (thickness ranging from 3.5 to 6.5 cm)were performed to assess the absolute bias and the precision with which thissphere can be visualized.RESULTS: When a 6.5 cm thick phantom was used, along the horizontal plane, thetarget volume was visualized with an absolute bias and a precision of 2.1 and0.8 mm, respectively. Along the vertical axis (i.e., z-axis), these values were4.2 and 2.8 mm, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed system visualizes the target volume with an absolutebias that may be acceptable for BCS.© 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.DOI: 10.1002/mp.12884 PMID: 29574889
