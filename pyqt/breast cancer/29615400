Keytransgenic mouse models of breast cancer are generated and maintained on the FVB genetic background, and one such model is the mouse mammary tumorvirus-polyomavirus middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) mouse-an immunocompetenttransgenic mouse that exhibits spontaneous mammary tumor development andmetastasis with high penetrance. Backcrossing the MMTV-PyMT mouse from the FVBstrain onto a C57BL/6 genetic background, in order to leverage well-developedC57BL/6 immunologic tools, results in delayed tumor development and variablemetastatic phenotypes. Therefore, we initiated characterization of the FVB MHCclass I H-2q haplotype to establish useful immunologic tools for evaluatingantigen specificity in the murine FVB strain. Our study provides the firstdetailed molecular and immunoproteomic characterization of the FVB H-2q MHC classI alleles, including >8,500 unique peptide ligands, a multiallele murine MHCpeptide prediction tool, and in vivo validation of these data using MMTV-PyMTprimary tumors. This work allows researchers to rapidly predict H-2 peptideligands for immune testing, including, but not limited to, the MMTV-PyMT modelfor metastatic breast cancer.
