However, themechanism of this mortality benefit remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate thatstatin drug lipophilicity and affinity for its target enzyme, HMGCR, determinetheir growth suppressive potency against various tumor cell lines. The lipophilicatorvastatin decreases cancer cell proliferation and survival in vitro. Statinsensitivity coincided with Ras localization to the cytosol instead of themembrane, consistent with a decrement in prenylation. To investigate signalingpathways that may be involved with sensitivity to statin therapy, we employedinhibitors of the PI3K-Akt and Mek-Erk signaling cascades. We found thatinhibition of PI3K signaling through Akt potentiated statin sensitivity of breastcancer cells in vitro and in co-culture with primary human hepatocytes. The same effect was not observed with inhibition of Mek signaling through Erk. Moreover,the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to atorvastatin-mediated growthsuppression correlated with a decrease in EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. Asan increase in Akt activity has been shown to be involved in the metastasis andmetastatic outgrowth of many cancer types (including breast), these data suggest a mechanism by which statins may reduce cancer specific mortality in patients.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197422 PMCID: PMC5953490PMID: 29763460
