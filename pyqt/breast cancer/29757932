We revealed SOX7-mediated gene expressionprofile in breast cancer cells using microarray chips and discovered multiplealtered signaling pathways. When combinatorially analyzing the microarray datawith a gene array dataset from 759 breast cancer patients, we identified fourgenes as potential targets of SOX7 and validated them by quantitative PCR andchromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Among these four genes, we determined that SOX7-activated SPRY1 and SLIT2, and SOX7-repressed TRIB3 and MTHFD2 could alldifferentially contribute to SOX7-mediated tumor suppression. Overall, weidentified multiple cancer-related pathways mediated by SOX7 and for the firsttime revealed SOX7-regulated target genes in a cancer-relevant context.DOI: 10.3390/ijms19051451 PMCID: PMC5983648PMID: 29757932
