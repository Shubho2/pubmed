The mass accumulation of eachAuNP type inside cancer cells was determined quantitatively, using InductiveCoupled Plasma - mass spectroscopy. The sub-cellular accumulation was studiedusing Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). It was found that goldnanoparticles applied to cancer cells were localized in cytoplasmic vesicles and that the highest uptake was shown in the presence of Au-GSH nanoparticles. Theeffect of AuNPs on the cell cycle was investigated using flow cytometry andWestern blot analysis. The gold nanoparticles alone did not affect the cellcycle, as shown by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the cancer cells were irradiated using conventional clinically relevant high-energy X-ray radiation of 6 MV in thedose of 4 Gy. The results on cells only irradiated showed an S phase arrest sixand 8 h after irradiation, and a G2/M arrest 24 and 48 h after irradiation. Theirradiation of breast cancer cells treated with AuNPs has shown no significantvariation in cell cycle distribution as opposed to X-ray radiation alone.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
