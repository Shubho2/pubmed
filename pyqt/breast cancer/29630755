Hence,breast density measures sensitive to small changes are desired.PURPOSE: Utilizing fat-water decomposition MRI, we propose an automated,reproducible breast density measurement, which is nonionizing and directlycomparable to mammographic density (MD).STUDY TYPE: Retrospective study.POPULATION: The study included two sample sets of breast cancer patients enrolledin a clinical trial, for concordance analysis with MD (40 patients) andreproducibility analysis (10 patients).FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: The majority of MRI scans (59 scans) were performed witha 1.5T GE Signa scanner using radial IDEAL-GRASE sequence, while the remaining(seven scans) were performed with a 3T Siemens Skyra using 3D Cartesian 6-echoGRE sequence with a similar fat-water separation technique.ASSESSMENT: After automated breast segmentation, breast density was calculatedusing FraGW, a new measure developed to reliably reflect the amount offibroglandular tissue and total water content in the entire breast. Based on its concordance with MD, FraGW was calibrated to MR-based breast density (MRD) to be comparable to MD. A previous breast density measurement, Fra80-the ratio ofbreast voxels with <80% fat fraction-was also calculated for comparison withFraGW.STATISTICAL TESTS: Pearson correlation was performed between MD (referencestandard) and FraGW (and Fra80). Test-retest reproducibility of MRD was evaluatedusing the difference between test-retest measures (Δ1-2 ) and intraclasscorrelation coefficient (ICC).RESULTS: Both FraGW and Fra80 were strongly correlated with MD (Pearson ρ: 0.96vs. 0.90, both P < 0.0001). MRD converted from FraGW showed higher test-retestreproducibility (Δ1-2 variation: 1.1% ± 1.2%; ICC: 0.99) compared to MD itself(literature intrareader ICC ≤0.96) and Fra80.DATA CONCLUSION: The proposed MRD is directly comparable with MD and highlyreproducible, which enables the early detection of small breast density changesand treatment response.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 1 J.
