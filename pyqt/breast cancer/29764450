Mammary gland was delineated as clinical target volume CTV, as well as CTV_lob and CTV_fat,being the lobular and fat fractions of the entire mammary gland. Patients wereplanned for volumetric modulated arc therapy technique, optimized in the VarianEclipse treatment planning system. CT, structures and plans were imported inPRIMO, based on Monte Carlo code Penelope, to run three simulations: AdiMus,where the adipose and muscle tissues were automatically assigned to fat andlobular fractions of the breast; Adi and Mus, where adipose and muscle,respectively were assigned to the whole mammary gland. The specific tissuedensity was kept identical from the CT dataset. Differences in mean doses in the CTV_lob and CTV_fat structures were evaluated for the different tissueassignments. Differences generated by the tissue composition and estimated byAcuros dose calculations in Eclipse were also analysed.RESULTS: From Monte Carlo simulations, the dose in the lobular fraction of thebreast, when adipose tissue is assigned in place of muscle, is overestimated by1.25 ± 0.45%; the dose in the fat fraction of the breast with muscle tissueassignment is underestimated by 1.14 ± 0.51%. Acuros showed an overestimation of 0.98 ± 0.06% and an underestimation of 0.21 ± 0.14% in the lobular and fatportions, respectively. Reason of this dissimilarity resides in the fact that thetwo calculations, Monte Carlo and Acuros, differently manage the range of CTnumbers and the material assignments, having Acuros an overlapping range, wheretwo tissues are both present in defined proportions.CONCLUSION: Although not clinically significant, the dose deposition differencein the lobular and connective fat fraction of the breast tissue lead to animproved knowledge of the possible dose distribution and homogeneity in thebreast radiation treatment.DOI: 10.1186/s13014-018-1022-1 PMCID: PMC5952506PMID: 29764450
