Electronic address: molly.shoichet@utoronto.ca.Breast cancer cell invasion is influenced by growth factor concentrationgradients in the tumor microenvironment. However, studying the influence ofgrowth factor gradients on breast cancer cell invasion is challenging due to boththe complexities of in vivo models and the difficulties in recapitulating thetumor microenvironment with defined gradients using in vitro models. A definedhyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel crosslinked with matrix metalloproteinase(MMP) cleavable peptides and modified with multiphoton labile nitrodibenzofuran(NDBF) was synthesized to photochemically immobilize epidermal growth factor(EGF) gradients. We demonstrate that EGF gradients can differentially influencebreast cancer cell invasion and drug response in cell lines with different EGFreceptor (EGFR) expression levels. Photopatterned EGF gradients increase theinvasion of moderate EGFR expressing MDA-MB-231 cells, reduce invasion of highEGFR expressing MDA-MB-468 cells, and have no effect on invasion of lowEGFR-expressing MCF-7 cells. We evaluate MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell response to the clinically tested EGFR inhibitor, cetuximab. Interestingly, the cellularresponse to cetuximab is completely different on the EGF gradient hydrogels:cetuximab decreases MDA-MB-231 cell invasion but increases MDA-MB-468 cellinvasion and cell number, thus demonstrating the importance of includingcell-microenvironment interactions when evaluating drug targets.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
