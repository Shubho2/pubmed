Additionally, some women with early-stage breast cancermay elect to undergo a mastectomy for cosmetic reasons, to potentially avoidradiation, or due to a genetic mutation that portends a higher risk for asubsequent breast cancer. A mastectomy involves removal of the whole breast andoften is paired with some degree of axillary lymph node sampling (either sentinellymph node biopsy or axillary node dissection of level 1 and 2). Post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) is recommended for patients with more advanced diseaseand/or with certain high-risk pathologic features. In select patients,post-mastectomy radiation therapy has been shown to improve local control andoverall survival. PMRT is directed at the chest wall and often includes theregional lymph nodes that drain the breast. This article will focus on the keyaspects of post-mastectomy radiation therapy.PMID: 30085576
