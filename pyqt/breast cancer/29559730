Results were confirmed using geneexpression profiles from the Metabric data set (n = 1988) and whole-genomesequencing data from the TCGA cohort (n = 117).RESULTS: The overall mutation rate in coding and non-coding regions weresignificantly higher in ER-negative/HER2-negative tumours (P = 2.8E-03 andP = 2.4E-07, respectively). Recurrent sequence variations were identified innon-coding regulatory regions of several cancer-associated genes, includingNBPF1, PIK3CA and TP53. After multivariate regression analysis, gene signaturesassociated with three coding mutations (CDH1, MAP3K1 and TP53) and two non-codingvariants (CRTC3 and STAG2) in cancer-related genes predicted prognosis inER-positive/HER2-negative tumours.CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that sequence alterations influence gene expression and oncogenic pathways, possibly affecting the outcome of breastcancer patients. Our data provide potential opportunities to identify non-coding variations with functional and clinical relevance in breast cancer.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0030-0 PMCID: PMC5931099 [Available on 2019-04-01]PMID: 29559730
