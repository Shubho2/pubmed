Relationships between the IMA, age, theposterior nipple line (PNL) and compressed breast thickness will be identifiedand the study outcomes validated using appropriate analyses of inter-reader andinter-rater reliability and variability. Differences in left versus right datawere also investigated.METHOD: A quantitative retrospective study of 2270 randomly selected paireddigital mammograms performed by BreastScreen NSW was undertaken. Data wascollected by direct measurement and visual analysis. Intra-class correlationanalyses were used to evaluate inter- and intra-rater reliability.RESULTS: The IMA was demonstrated on 52.4% of individual and 42.6% of pairedmammograms. A linear relationship was found between the posterior nipple line(PNL) and age (p-value <0.001). The PNL was predicted to increase by 0.48 mm for every one year increment in age. The odds of demonstrating the IMA reduced by 2% for every one year increase in age (p-value = 0.001); are 0.4% higher for every1 mm increase in PNL (p-value = 0.001) and 1.6% lower for every 1 mm increase in compressed breast thickness, (p-value<0.001). There was high inter- andintra-rater reliability for the PNL while there was 100% agreement for thedemonstration of the IMA.CONCLUSION: Analysis of the demonstration of the IMA indicates clinicallyachievable rates (42.6%) well below that required for compliance (50%-75%) toknown worldwide accreditation standards for screening mammography. Thesestandards should be aligned to the reported evidence base. Visualisation of theIMA is impacted negatively by increasing age and compressed breast thickness but positively by breast size (PNL).Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
