Numerous small-molecule inhibitorstargeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limitingtoxicities and the emergence of resistance limit therapeutic efficacy. Variousresistance mechanisms to PI3K inhibitors have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found apreviously unknown resistance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that resultsin AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer celllines, treatment with a PI3K inhibitor or depletion of PIK3CA expressionultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitinligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1(phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth andmetabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2),but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP3 production. Resistance to PI3Kinhibitors correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation ofAKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. Thesefindings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K inhibitor resistance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.Copyright Â© 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science.
