This study is based on acohort of 78,050 women invited to undergo a mammogram by Local Health Authorityof Milan, between 2003 and 2007. We carried out a nested case-control studyincluding all the 3303 incident breast cancer cases diagnosed up to 2015, and9909 controls matched by age and year of enrollment. Odds ratios (ORs) andcorresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using logisticregression models. The ORs were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.78-0.98) for an age at menarche≥14 years and 1.39 (95% CI: 1.07-1.81) for an age of 30 years or older at firstpregnancy. Body mass index (BMI) was positively associated with breast cancerrisk in women older than 50 years (OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.54-2.31, for BMI≥30 vs.<20), while the association tended to be inverse in younger women. A highmammographic density increased breast cancer risk (OR = 2.61, 95% CI: 2.02-3.38for density >75% vs. adipose tissue). The ORs were 1.67 (95% CI: 1.47-1.89) and2.04 (95% CI: 1.38-3.00) for one first-degree relative and two or more relatives affected by breast cancer, respectively. Our study confirms the role of majorrecognized risk factors for breast cancer in our population and provides thebasis for a stratification of the participants in the mammographic screeningaccording to different levels of risk.© 2018 The Authors.
