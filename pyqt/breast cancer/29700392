This is likely due to the resistance of slowly proliferatingtumour-initiating cells (TICs), and understanding molecular mechanisms thatcontrol TICs behaviour is crucial for the development of effective therapeuticapproaches. Here, we present our novel findings, indicating that an intrinsicallycatalytically inactive member of the Eph group of receptor tyrosine kinases,EPHB6, partially suppresses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in TNBC cells, while also promoting expansion of TICs. Our work reveals that EPHB6 interactswith the GRB2 adapter protein and that its effect on enhancing cell proliferationis mediated by the activation of the RAS-ERK pathway, which allows it to elevate the expression of the TIC-related transcription factor, OCT4. Consistent withthis, suppression of either ERK or OCT4 activities blocks EPHB6-inducedpro-proliferative responses. In line with its ability to trigger propagation ofTICs, EPHB6 accelerates tumour growth, potentiates tumour initiation andincreases TIC populations in xenograft models of TNBC. Remarkably, EPHB6 alsosuppresses tumour drug resistance to DNA-damaging therapy, probably by forcingTICs into a more proliferative, drug-sensitive state. In agreement, patients withhigher EPHB6 expression in their tumours have a better chance for recurrence-freesurvival. These observations describe an entirely new mechanism that governs TNBCand suggest that it may be beneficial to enhance EPHB6 action concurrent withapplying a conventional DNA-damaging treatment, as it would decrease drugresistance and improve tumour elimination.DOI: 10.1038/s41388-018-0228-x PMCID: PMC6062499PMID: 29700392
