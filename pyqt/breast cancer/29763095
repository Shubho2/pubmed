Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2018-.2018 Apr 23.Author information: (1)Michigan State Un/McLaren Oakland(2)Un of TorontoRadiation esophagitis is inflammation of the esophagitis due to radiation.Radiation esophagitis is typically an adverse effect that develops in individualsreceiving radiation cancer therapy, most commonly for breast, lung, and otherlymphomas. Symptoms present two to three weeks after initial therapy and include throat pain, dysphagia, and the sensation that food is stuck. Ethyol (amifostine)is a medication used as a radiation protector in selected populations at risk of radiation esophagitis. Typically administered via injection 30 minutes beforetherapy, patient studies have been promising, showing a reduced risk ofdeveloping radiation esophagitis. The goal when treating this condition isadequate nutrition intake, and it is advisable for patients to refrain fromeating hot or spicy foods that can further irritate the esophageal lining. Insevere cases, perforations, ulcerations, dysmotility, and tracheoesophagealfistulas can be seen. Although there is no cure for radiation esophagitis,symptoms regress 2 to 4 weeks after the completion of radiation treatment.PMID: 29763095
