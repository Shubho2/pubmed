Participants completed a questionnairemeasuring acculturation, and clinical and demographic variables were obtainedfrom an institutional database. Multivariable logistic regression models wereconstructed to examine differences in surgical procedures received and adherence to long-term survivorship care by acculturation level.RESULTS: Bilingual (odds ratio [OR] = 1.85; 95% confidence interval[CI] = 0.85-4.02, P = .11) and English-dominant women (OR = 2.39; 95%CI = 1.02-5.61, P = .04) were more likely to receive breast-conserving surgery(versus mastectomy) than were Spanish-dominant women. Among all patients,adherence to surveillance mammography and clinic visits decreased over time; the decline in clinic visit adherence was statistically significant (P = .005).Although no statistically significant association was found between acculturationand adherence to long-term survivorship care, receipt of breast-conservingsurgery (versus mastectomy) was significantly associated with higher adherence tosurveillance mammograms.CONCLUSION: Acculturation may play a role in decision-making about surgicalmanagement of breast cancer, and further studies with larger samples are neededto explore its role in adherence to survivorship care recommendations. Findingsfrom this study may help identify patients requiring additional support whilemaking decisions pertaining to their cancer treatment and survivorship care.DOI: 10.1007/s11764-018-0703-y PMID: 30043339
