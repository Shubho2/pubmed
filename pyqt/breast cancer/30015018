Currently, detection and diagnosis of breast cancer is achieved through a varietyof procedures, such as clinical examination, medical imaging, biopsy, andhistopathological analysis. In contrast, spectroscopic analysis has a variety of advantages such as being noninvasive, not destroying biological materials, andnot requiring additional histological analysis. In this study, various approachesusing Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and optical microscopywere used together to differentiate between and characterize normal breast celllines (MCF-10A) and breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453). Ramanspectra of normal breast cell and breast cancer cell lines confirmed visualdifferences in the concentrations of various compounds. These spectra were alsoanalyzed using principle component analysis (PCA), and the PCA results showedreliable separation of the three cell lines and the cancer cell lines(MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453). With these results, optically synchronizing the AFMmorphology, the Raman spectroscopy, and the visible RGB optical transmissionintensity provided contrasts for not only conformational differences but alsointracellular variation between the normal and cancer cell lines. We observed theinherent characteristic that there is no local difference in cancer cellsregardless of morphology in a wide range of optical properties such asabsorption, scattering and inelastic scattering.Copyright Â© 2018.
