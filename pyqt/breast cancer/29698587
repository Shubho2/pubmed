As such, VDAC1 is involved in two important hallmarks of cancer development, namely energy and metabolic reprograming andapoptotic cell death evasion. We previously developed cell-penetratingVDAC1-derived peptides that interact with hexokinase (HK), Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL toprevent the anti-apoptotic activities of these proteins and induce cancer celldeath, with a focus on leukemia and glioblastoma. In this study, we demonstrated the sensitivity of a panel of genetically characterized cancer cell lines,differing in origin and carried mutations, to VDAC1-based peptide-inducedapoptosis. Noncancerous cell lines were less affected by the peptides.Furthermore, we constructed additional VDAC1-based peptides with the aim ofimproving targeting, selectivity, and cellular stability, including R-Tf-D-LP4,containing the transferrin receptor internalization sequence (Tf) that allowstargeting of the peptide to cancer cells, known to overexpress the transferrinreceptor. The mode of action of the VDAC1-based peptides involves HK detachment, interfering with the action of anti-apoptotic proteins, and thus activatingmultiple routes leading to an impairment of cell energy and metabolismhomeostasis and the induction of apoptosis. Finally, in xenograft glioblastoma,lung, and breast cancer mouse models, R-Tf-D-LP4 inhibited tumor growth whileinducing massive cancer cell death, including of cancer stem cells. Thus,VDAC1-based peptides offer an innovative new conceptual framework for cancertherapy.Â© 2018 The Authors.
