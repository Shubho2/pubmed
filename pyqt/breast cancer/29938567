[Epub ahead ofprint]Global profiling of hnRNP A2/B1-RNA binding on chromatin highlights LncRNAinteractions.Nguyen ED(1)(2)(3), Balas MM(1)(2)(4), Griffin AM(2), Roberts JT(1)(2), JohnsonAM(1)(2)(4).Author information: (1)a Molecular Biology Program , University of Colorado Denver Anschutz MedicalCampus , Aurora , CO , USA.(2)b Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Aurora , University ofColorado School of Medicine , CO , USA.(3)c Medical Scientist Training Program , University of Colorado School ofMedicine , Aurora , CO , USA.(4)d University of Colorado School of Medicine RNA Bioscience Initiative , Aurora, CO , USA.Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) often carry out their functions throughassociations with adaptor proteins. We recently identified heterogeneousribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 as an adaptor of the human HOTAIR lncRNA. hnRNPA2 and B1 are splice isoforms of the same gene. The spliced version of HOTAIRpreferentially associates with the B1 isoform, which we hypothesize contributesto RNA-RNA matching between HOTAIR and transcripts of target genes in breastcancer. Here we used enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) to mapthe direct interactions between A2/B1 and RNA in breast cancer cells. Despitediffering by only twelve amino acids, the A2 and B1 splice isoforms associatepreferentially with distinct populations of RNA in vivo. Through cellularfractionation experiments we characterize the pattern of RNA association inchromatin, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm. We find that a majority of interactionsoccur on chromatin, even those that do not contribute to co-transcriptionalsplicing. A2/B1 binding site locations on multiple RNAs hint at a contribution tothe regulation and function of lncRNAs. Surprisingly, the strongest A2/B1 bindingsite occurs in a retained intron of HOTAIR, which interrupts an RNA-RNAinteraction hotspot. In vitro eCLIP experiments highlight additional exonic B1binding sites in HOTAIR which also surround the RNA-RNA interaction hotspot.Interestingly, a version of HOTAIR with the intron retained is still capable ofmaking RNA-RNA interactions in vitro through the hotspot region. Our data furthercharacterize the multiple functions of a repurposed splicing factor withisoform-biased interactions, and highlight that the majority of these functionsoccur on chromatin-associated RNA.DOI: 10.1080/15476286.2018.1474072 PMID: 29938567
