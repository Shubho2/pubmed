China.Breast metastases from solid non-breast tumor types are rare; however, theyshould be always considered in the differential diagnosis of a breast lesionowing to the associated poor patient prognosis and the requirement of differenttherapeutic strategies compared with those used to treat primary breast cancer.The aim of the current study was to summarize the characteristics of metastasesto the breast in a southern Chinese population. The medical records andpathological sections of 22 patients with pathologically confirmed extra-mammary metastases to the breast that presented to Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Centerbetween January 2000 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The median age of onset for breast metastasis was 43 years (range, 10-62 years) and 19(86.4%) patients had a known history of a primary tumor. The mean interval fromdiagnosis of the primary tumor to breast metastasis was 16.5 months (range, 6-56 months). A unilateral (45.5% left, 36.4% right), upper outer quadrant (15/22,68.2%) lesion of the breast was most frequently initially detected byself-checking (63.6%). The most common origin of the primary tumor was the lung(22.7%). Nasopharyngeal carcinoma accounted for a high proportion of themetastases (18.2%). The median duration of survival from the time of diagnosis ofa breast metastasis was 14 months (range, 2-74 months). A total of 10 patients(45.5%) succumbed to the disease. The results also indicated that overallsurvival in patients that underwent surgery was improved compared with patientswho did not undergo surgery. The results of the present study demonstrated thatclinical history, imaging findings, pathology from the primary tumor andimmunostaining were required in combination to establish an accurate diagnosis.Further investigation into the improvement of the prognosis of patients withmetastases to the breast following surgery is required.DOI: 10.3892/ol.2018.7741 PMCID: PMC5795931PMID: 29467888
