The impact ofhealth behaviors on long-term quality of life (QoL) in DCIS survivors has notbeen investigated.METHODS: We examined the association of post-diagnosis body mass index (BMI),physical activity, alcohol, and smoking with QoL among 1448 DCIS survivors aged20-74 enrolled in the population-based Wisconsin in situ Cohort from 1997 to2006. Health behaviors and QoL were self-reported during biennial post-diagnosis interviews. Physical and mental QoL were measured using the validated SF-36questionnaire. Generalized linear regression was used to determine theassociation between behaviors and QoL with adjustment for confounders. Laggedbehavior variables were used to predict QoL during follow-up and avoid reversecausation.RESULTS: Women reported 3,536 QoL observations over an average 7.9 years offollow-up. Women maintaining a healthy BMI had on average a significantly higher summary measure score of physical QoL than obese women (normal versus obese:β = 3.02; 2.18, 3.85). Physical QoL scores were also elevated among those whowere physically active (5 + h/week vs. none: β = 1.96; 0.72, 3.20), thoseconsuming at least seven drinks/week of alcohol (vs. none; β = 1.40; 0.39, 2.41),and nonsmokers (vs. current smokers: β = 1.80; 0.89, 2.71). Summary measures ofmental QoL were significantly higher among women who were moderately physicallyactive (up to 2 h/week vs. none: β = 1.11; 0.30, 1.92) and nonsmokers (vs.current smokers: β = 1.49;0.45, 2.53).CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that maintaining healthy behaviors followingDCIS treatment is associated with modest improvements in long-term QoL. Theseresults inform interventions aimed at promoting healthy behaviors and optimizing QoL in DCIS survivors.DOI: 10.1007/s11136-018-1807-6 PMID: 29417425
