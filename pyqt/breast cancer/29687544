[Epub ahead of print]Palpable breast abnormalities in women under age 40.Lee MV(1), Shaw HL(2), Chi T(3), Brazeal HA(4), Holley SO(5), Appleton CM(1).Author information: (1)Breast Imaging Section, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, WashingtonUniversity School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.(2)Radia Inc., PS, Lynnwood, WA, USA.(3)Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis,MO, USA.(4)Fairfax Radiological Consultants, Fairfax, VA, USA.(5)Wake Radiology, Raleigh, NC, USA.Although the prevalence of malignancy in average risk women under age 40presenting with a palpable breast abnormality is low, the management ofbenign-appearing palpable abnormalities remains controversial. This studyassesses the imaging evaluation, subsequent management, and outcomes of womenunder age 40 presenting with a palpable area of concern. This study alsoevaluates the costs, utility, and outcomes of BI-RADS 3 assessment in thispatient population. A single institution retrospective case review from July 2010through June 2013 identified women under age 40 presenting with a new palpablebreast abnormality. Diagnostic imaging evaluation was performed. BI-RADSassessments and recommendations were recorded prospectively. Outcome wasdetermined by tissue diagnosis, 2 years of surveillance, or search of thehospital tumor registry. Performance measures were calculated. Among 1440 cases, 1052 were initially assessed as BI-RADS 1 or 2 (73.1%), 184 as BI-RADS 3 (12.8%),182 as BI-RADS 4 (12.6%), and 22 as BI-RADS 5 (1.5%). In all, 30 breastmalignancies were diagnosed (cancer yield 2.1%). All 30 cancers were initiallycategorized as BI-RADS 4 or 5. No BI-RADS 1, 2, or 3 findings proved malignant.The imaging evaluation sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 87.7%, and accuracy was 87.9%. The negative predictive value was 100% and the positive predictivevalue was 14.7%. Average risk women under age 40 presenting with a palpableabnormality have a low prevalence of breast cancer. Imaging evaluation has a highsensitivity and negative predictive value, thereby allowing for confidentcharacterization and appropriate management recommendations. For palpable solidmasses with benign imaging features in women under age 40, short-term intervalfollow-up with subsequent periodic imaging or clinical examination for a total of2 years is a cost-effective and safe alternative to biopsy.Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.DOI: 10.1111/tbj.13035 PMID: 29687544
