Participantscompleted a demographics form and the Functional Assessment of CancerTherapy-General QOL questionnaire (FACT-G). Descriptive statistics weregenerated.RESULTS: Participants were ages 28-78; most of the participants had breast(38.0%), prostate (14.0%) and cervical and ovarian cancers (10.1%) treated withchemotherapy (45.6%). The participants had a mean total score on the FACT-G of75.2 (SD = 18.9). As a group, the functional well-being was the most affected(mean 17.2, SD 6.8), and the Social/Familial was the least affected (mean 20.7,SD 6.0).CONCLUSION: Cancer is the leading cause of death in the island of Puerto Rico.Female Puerto Rican cancer patients in this study sample had increased risk forexperiencing worse: overall HRQOL, physical well-being and emotional well-beingcompared to males. Given that the Hispanic oncology population does not alwaysreport symptoms, risking under-assessment and under management, this suggeststhere may be a greater need for HRQOL surveillance for this population.PMCID: PMC5863575PMID: 29547684
