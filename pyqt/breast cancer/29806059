In total, 310 Chinese women undergoing mastectomy wererecruited from a hospital in the Hunan province between 2012 and 2013. Uponenrollment (T1), all women were administered the Chinese version of Body Imageafter Breast Cancer Questionnaire (BIBCQ) (BIBCQ-C), NA subscale of Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived SocialSupport (MSPSS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale(HAMD). Two weeks later, BIBCQ-C was re-administered. Six months later (T2), the NA subscale was administered again. We first evaluated the psychometricproperties of BIBCQ-C, and then investigated the long-term impact of differentaspects of body image on NA using forced entry hierarchical regression analyses. The BIBCQ-C scores demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (all Cronbach's α> 0.70) and test-retest reliability (all ICC > 0.86). Confirmatory factoranalysis supported the six-factor model (CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.04).Regression analysis showed that two dimensions of body image, vulnerability(β = 0.217) and body concern (β = 0.119) at T1, significantly predict NA at T2(all p < 0.05). BIBCQ-C was a good instrument for measuring multifaceted bodyimage. Improvement of vulnerability and body concern, two aspects of body image, may reduce post-surgery NA among Chinese women undergoing mastectomy.DOI: 10.1007/s00737-018-0860-z PMID: 29806059
