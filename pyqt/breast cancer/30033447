In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis ofthis relationship.METHODS: We analysed a set of 922 patients with invasive breast cancer andpre-operative MRI. The MRIs were analysed by a computer algorithm to extract 529 features of the tumour and the surrounding tissue. Machine-learning-based models based on the imaging features were trained using a portion of the data (461patients) to predict the following molecular, genomic, and proliferationcharacteristics: tumour surrogate molecular subtype, oestrogen receptor,progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor status, as well as atumour proliferation marker (Ki-67). Trained models were evaluated on the set of the remaining 461 patients.RESULTS: Multivariate models were predictive of Luminal A subtype withAUC = 0.697 (95% CI: 0.647-0.746, p < .0001), triple negative breast cancer with AUC = 0.654 (95% CI: 0.589-0.727, p < .0001), ER status with AUC = 0.649 (95% CI:0.591-0.705, p < .001), and PR status with AUC = 0.622 (95% CI: 0.569-0.674,p < .0001). Associations between individual features and subtypes we also found.CONCLUSIONS: There is a moderate association between tumour molecular biomarkers and algorithmically assessed imaging features.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0185-8 PMID: 30033447
