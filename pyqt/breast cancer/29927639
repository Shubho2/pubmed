Mammographic tumor mass and calcification features in relation to HER2 molecular subtype were analyzed.RESULTS: On univariate analysis, HER2-enriched molecular subtype rates weresignificantly higher (a) in tumor size <= 2 cm 33 of 57 [57.9%]) than in tumorsize >2 cm lesions (22 of 226 [9.7%]) (p = 0.007), (b) in non-spiculated mass 39 of 57 [68.4%]) than in spiculated mass lesions (18 of 226 [7.9%]) (p = 0.034)，(c)in calcifications extent >2 cm (41of 57 [71.9%]) lesions than in calcificationsextent <= 2 cm lesions (16 of 226 [7.1%]) (p < 0.001)and (d) in calcificationdensity ＞20/cm2 (44 of 57 [71.2%]) lesions than in calcification density <=20/cm2 lesions (13 of 226 [5.8%]) (p = 0.034).On multivariate analysis, threemammographic features (tumor size >2 cm vs size⩽2 cm OR: 0.415 95% CI: 0.215 to0.802, p = 0.009, spiculated mass vs non-spiculated mass OR: 0.226 95% CI: 0.114 to 0.446, p < 0.001 and calcifications extent >2 cm vs calcifications extent <= 2cm OR: 7.754, 95% CI: 3.100 to 19.339P < 0.001) were independent predictors. Our results indicated that small tumor size, non-spiculated mass and calcificationextent >2 cm are more likely to be HER2 molecular subtype. The discrimination of this model, as quantified by the AUC, was 0.751 (95%CI: 0.701 to 0.854).CONCLUSION: Our study presents a prediction model that incorporates themammographic features of tumor size, non-spiculated mass and calcificationextent, which can potentially be used to preoperative predict breast cancerHER2-enriched subtype.
