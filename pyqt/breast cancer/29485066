The institutional ethics committee approved the study,which was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier no.NCT02460744). Treatment planning was performed using a simulator with 2tangential fields to the breast/chest wall and an incident field to thesupraclavicular fossa. The radiation dose delivered was 34 Gy in 10 fractionswithin 2 weeks, followed by a boost of 10 Gy in 5 fractions within 1 week forpatients who underwent BCS. Acute skin toxicities were recorded during and after treatment according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group acute radiationtoxicity scoring criteria. The primary objective was to obtain estimates of theacute toxicity rates and cosmetic outcomes that could be used to design asubsequent phase III comparative study. Acute skin and late toxicities wererecorded during and after treatment. Cosmetic outcomes were assessed before andafter treatment and during the regular follow-up period. A cost/benefit analysis was also performed and compared with that for standard treatment of 35 Gy in 15fractions within 3 weeks.RESULTS: The median follow-up was 39 months (range 14-48). The mean age was51 years (range 26-75). A left-sided tumor was present in 25 patients (50%).Total mastectomy with axillary clearance was performed in 40 (80%) and BCS in 10 (20%) patients. Acute grade 2 and 3 skin toxicity was seen in 16 (32%) and 1 (2%)patient, respectively. In the BCS patients, grade 2 skin and subcutaneoustoxicity was seen in 2 (20%) and 1 (10%) patient, respectively. Grade 2 edema wasseen in 1 patient (10%). The cosmesis was excellent or good in 8 (80%) and fairor poor in 2 (20%) patients. The cost/benefit analysis revealed significantlyless financial burden on the patients with 2 weeks of treatment. Disease-free andoverall survival at 3 years was 94% and 96%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated radiation therapy within 2 weeks appears to befeasible for patients with breast cancer and was associated with acute and lateskin toxicity profiles similar to those observed with 3 weeks of treatment. Thefinancial burden on the patient and family could be reduced with 2 weeks oftreatment. Long-term follow-up data and a prospective comparative study areneeded to strengthen these results. Hypofractionation might help radiationcenters worldwide to meet the increasing need for radiation for breast cancer,especially in developing countries where resources are limited and patients must travel long distances for treatment.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.
