However, this issue remains controversial. Therefore, we conducted an updated meta-analysis to investigate the role ofleptin in breast cancer.METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search and identified relevantpapers up to 1 September 2017. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95%confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate effect sizes.RESULTS: Thirty-five eligible studies were included in the current meta-analysis.Serum leptin levels were related to breast cancer risk as demonstrated bycalculations of the overall SMD = 0.46 (95% CI = 0.31-0.60, I = 93.5%). Asubgroup analysis of BMI identified an association between breast cancer andserum leptin levels in patients who are overweight and obese (overweight:SMD = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.13-0.57, I = 88.1%; obesity: SMD = 1.38, 95%CI = 0.64-2.12, I = 89.6%). Additionally, menopausal status subgroup analysisrevealed a significant association in postmenopausal women (SMD = 0.26, 95%CI = 0.12-0.40, I = 77.9%). Furthermore, we identified a significant association between breast cancer and serum leptin levels in Chinese women (SMD = 0.61, 95%CI = 0.44-0.79, I = 40.6%).CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggested that leptin could be apotential biomarker for breast cancer risk in women, especially overweight/obese or postmenopausal women. Therefore, it may be useful for identifying subjectswith a high risk for breast cancer who may benefit from preventive treatments.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011345 PMID: 29979411  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
