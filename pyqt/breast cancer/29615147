[Epub ahead ofprint]MiR-223-5p suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in non-small cell lung cancerby targeting E2F8.Dou L(1), Han K(2), Xiao M(1), Lv F(2).Author information: (1)Department of Cardiology, the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin MedicalUniversity, Harbin 150081, China.(2)Department of Respiratory Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital of HarbinMedical University, Harbin 150081, China.MiR-223-5p has been demonstrated to regulate the development and progression ofvarious cancers, such as hepatocellularcarcinoma, breast cancer and gastriccarcinoma. However, the role of miR-223-5p in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) requires further investigation. In this study, we found that the expression ofmiR-223-5p was significantly down-regulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines.Moreover, the expression level of miR223-5p is negatively correlated with themalignance of NSCLC. Besides, we found that overexpression of miR-223-5premarkably suppressed the proliferation of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo.MiR-223-5p overexpression also led to reduced migration and invasion in NSCLCcells. Mechanistically, we found that E2F8, a key transcription factor involvedin many kinds of biological processes, was a direct target gene of miR-223-5p.Overexpression of miR-223-5p significantly decreased the mRNA and protein levels of E2F8 in NSCLC cells. What's more, we showed that restoration of E2F8 rescuedthe proliferation, migration and invasion of miR-223-5p-overexpressing NSCLCcells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that miR-223-5p suppressed NSCLCprogression through targeting E2F8.DOI: 10.3727/096504018X15219188894056 PMID: 29615147
