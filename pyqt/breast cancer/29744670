The aim of this study was to evaluate theusefulness of the Medical Imaging Projection System (MIPS), which uses activeprojection mapping, for SLN biopsy.METHODS: A total of 56 patients (59 procedures) underwent SLN biopsy using theMIPS between March 2016 and November 2017. After SLN biopsy using the MIPS,residual SLNs were removed using a conventional NIR camera and/or radioisotopemethod. The primary endpoint of this study was identification rate of SLNs using the MIPS.RESULTS: In all procedures, at least one SLN was detected by the MIPS, giving an SLN identification rate of 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) 94-100%]. SLNbiopsy was successfully performed without operating lights in all procedures. In total, 3 positive SLNs were excised using MIPS, but were not included in theadditional SLNs excised by other methods. The median number of SLNs excised usingthe MIPS was 3 (range 1-7). Of procedures performed after preoperative systemictherapy, the median number of SLNs excised using the MIPS was 3 (range 2-6).CONCLUSIONS: The MIPS is effective in detecting SLNs in patients with breastcancer, providing continuous and accurate projection of fluorescence signals inthe surgical field, without need for operating lights, and could be useful inreal-time navigation surgery for SLN biopsy.DOI: 10.1007/s12282-018-0868-2 PMID: 29744670
