[Epubahead of print]Biochemical studies evaluating the chemopreventive potential of brucine inchemically induced mammary carcinogenesis of rats.Saminathan U(1), Pugalendhi P(2), Subramaniyan S(1), Jayaganesh R(1).Author information: (1)a Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology , Annamalai University ,Annamalai Nagar , India.(2)b Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology , Annamalai University ,Chidambaram, Annamalai Nagar , 608002 , India.The present study was aimed to investigate the dose dependent chemopreventiveactivity of brucine against 7, 12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene induced mammarygland tumorigenesis in rats. The mammary tumor was induced by a single dose ofDMBA (25 mg/rat) injected subcutaneously near the mammary gland. We observedreduced body weight and increased in tumor incidence the total number of tumorsand tumor volume in DMBA alone injected rats and also observed decreasedantioxidant status (SOD, CAT, GPX, and GSH) and increased lipid peroxidation(TBARS and LOOH) in plasma and mammary tissues. Increased levels of CYP450,Cyt-b5 and decreased levels of phase II (GST and GR) biotransformation enzymesnoticed in the liver and mammary tissues. Further increased levels of lipidprofile (TC, TG, PL, and FFA) and lipoprotein (LDL and VLDL) were noticed.Whereas, decreased the level of HDL in plasma and decreased levels of PL and FFA in mammary tissues. Oral administration of brucine in different doses (2, 4 and8 mg/kg bw) inhibited the tumor incidence and restored the levels of biochemical markers near to normal in dose responsive manner. Biochemical findings aresupported by histopathological studies. The results suggest that brucine at adose of 8 mg/kg bw shows more significant chemopreventive activity inDMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis.DOI: 10.1080/15376516.2018.1502387 PMID: 30027798
