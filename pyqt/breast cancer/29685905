IRS1 has been implicated in the proliferation and survival of breast tumor cells. In contrast, IRS2 facilitates glycolysis,invasion, and metastasis. To determine the mechanistic basis for IRS2-dependentfunctions, we investigated unique structural features of IRS2 that are requiredfor invasion. Our studies revealed that the ability of IRS2 to promote invasionis dependent upon upstream insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)/insulinreceptor (IR) activation and the recruitment and activation ofphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), functions shared with IRS1. In addition, a 174-amino-acid region in the IRS2 C-terminal tail, which is not conserved inIRS1, is also required for IRS2-mediated invasion. Importantly, this "invasion(INV) region" is sufficient to confer invasion-promoting ability when swappedinto IRS1. However, the INV region is not required for the IRS2-dependentregulation of glucose uptake. Bone morphogenetic protein 2-inducible kinase(BMP2K) binds to the INV region and contributes to IRS2-dependent invasion. Takentogether, our data advance the mechanistic understanding of how IRS2 regulatesinvasion and reveal that IRS2 functions important for cancer can be independentlytargeted without interfering with the metabolic activities of this adaptorprotein.Copyright Â© 2018 American Society for Microbiology.DOI: 10.1128/MCB.00590-17 PMCID: PMC6024166 [Available on 2018-12-28]PMID: 29685905
