The women were divided into three groups: breast cancer,lymphoma or other cancer. All of them had been recently diagnosed with cancer,with gonadotoxic treatment scheduled, and had oocyte vitrification after ovarian stimulation with antagonist protocol.RESULTS: Baseline antral follicle count and anti-Müllerian hormone were nodifferent between women with breast cancer, lymphoma or other cancer. The number of cancelled cycles for poor ovarian response was similar between the groups. Thenumber of FSH units per mature oocyte, the number of mature oocytes (metaphaseII) retrieved, and the oocyte maturity rate were not significantly differentbetween the three groups.CONCLUSIONS: As the type of cancer does not seem to significantly affect ovarian reserve and ovarian response to ovarian stimulation, our results do not supportthe relevance of integrating this parameter when establishing ovarian stimulationprotocol for oocyte vitrification cycle in women with cancer.Copyright © 2018 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.
