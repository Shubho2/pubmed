The objective of this study is to determine the magnitude and patternof comorbidities in Nigerian cancer populations, and demonstrate the use ofcomorbidity indices in predicting mortality/survival rates of cancer patients.Methods: Using a retrospective study design, data were extracted from hospitalreports of patients presenting for oncology care between January 2015 andDecember 2016 at two tertiary health facilities in Lagos, Nigeria. Patientcomorbidities were ranked and weighted using the Charlson comorbidity index(CCI).Results: The mean age for the 848 cancer patients identified was 53.9 ± 13.6years, with 657 (77.5%) females and 191 (22.5%) males. Breast (50.1%), cervical(11.1%) and colorectal (6.3%) cancers occurred most frequently. Comorbiditieswere present in 228 (26.9%) patients, with the most common being hypertension(20.4%), diabetes (6.7%) and peptic ulcer disease (2.1%). Hypertension-augmented CCI scores were 0 (15.6%), 1-3 (62.1%), 4-6 (21.7%) and ≥7 (0.6%). The mean CCIscores of patients ≤50 years (0.8 ± 0.9) and ≥51 years (3.3 ± 1.2) weresignificantly different (p < 0.05). Patients with lower mean CCI scores were morelikely to receive chemotherapy (2.2 ± 1.6 versus 2.5 ± 1.9; p < 0.05) and/orsurgery (2.1 ± 1.5 versus 2.4 ± 1.7; p < 0.05).Conclusion: Comorbidities occur significantly in Nigerian cancer patients andinfluence the prognosis, treatment outcome and survival rates of these patients. There is a need to routinely evaluate cancer patients for comorbidities with the aim of instituting appropriate multidisciplinary management measures wherenecessary.DOI: 10.3332/ecancer.2018.843 PMCID: PMC6027981PMID: 30034520
