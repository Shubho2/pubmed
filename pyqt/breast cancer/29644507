Several diseases aredirectly related to obesity, including diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis,stroke, musculoskeletal disorders, and a diverse range of malignances-such asbreast cancer. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of postmenopausalestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and worse cancer-related outcomes forall breast tumor subtypes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to contribute tothe obesity-cancer link, including high levels of circulating and localestrogens, altered amounts of adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), disruptedinsulin/IGF signaling, modifications within the microbiome, and local andsystemic effects of inflammation. Here we will review recent advances in ourunderstanding of the complex signaling pathways underlying the obesity-cancerlink. An improved understanding of these processes is anticipated to propel noveland effective intervention strategies to reduce the global obesity-cancer burden.DOI: 10.1007/s11912-018-0688-8 PMID: 29644507
