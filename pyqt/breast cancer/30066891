They are able to regulate gene expression by either triggeringtarget messenger RNA degradation or by inhibiting mRNA translation. Enhancer ofzeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the core enzymatic subunit of polycomb repressorcomplex 2 and is responsible for the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine 27(H3K27me3); it is also able to silence a bundle of tumor suppressor genes throughpromoter binding. However, little is known regarding the effect of miR‑92b oncell autophagy, viability and invasion as well as how it interacts with EZH2. Thepresent study investigated the major role of miR‑92b in the autophagy, viability and invasion of breast cancer. It was revealed that in MCF‑7 and MDA‑MB‑453cells, the expression of miR‑92b promoted autophagy induced by starvation andrapamycin treatment. The results of in vitro experiments results demonstratedthat miR‑92b inhibited breast cancer cell viability, invasion and migration. Tofurther elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of miR‑92b in autophagy, a dualluciferase reporter assay was performed to determine whether miR‑92b targeted theEZH2 gene. The expression of miR‑92b was negatively correlated to EZH2 mRNAexpression in breast cancer. Depletion of EZH2 induced phenocopied effects onmiR‑92b overexpression, thereby demonstrating its importance in autophagy. These results indicated that miR‑92b may serve an important role in breast cancer incontrolling autophagy, viability and invasion. The present study indicated thatmiR‑92b and EZH2 may serve as potential biomarkers for cancer detection andhighlighted their possible therapeutic implications.DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4486 PMID: 30066891
