65. Genes Genet Syst. 2018 Aug 6. doi: 10.1266/ggs.17-00053. [Epub ahead of print]Two polymorphisms, rs2046210 and rs3803662, are associated with breast cancerrisk in a Vietnamese case-control cohort.Thanh NTN(1), Lan NTT(2), Phat PT(1), Giang NDT(2), Hue NT(1).Author information: (1)Department of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Science, VietnamNational University.(2)Department of Biotechnology, International University, Vietnam NationalUniversity.Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Breast tumorigenesis encompasses both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Among intrinsic aspects, theappearance of DNA variation can cause genetic instability, which may lead tocarcinogenesis. Genome-wide association studies have found several potentialbreast cancer-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in many differentpopulations. Among these, seven (rs2046210, rs1219648, rs3817198, rs3803662,rs889312, rs10941679 and rs13281615) have been shown to be significantlyassociated with breast cancer risk in various populations including those verysimilar to the Vietnamese. Here, therefore, we have investigated the relationshipbetween these SNPs and breast cancer risk in a Vietnamese population case-controlcohort. Real-time PCR high-resolution melt analysis was performed to genotype 300breast cancer cases and 325 healthy controls, and the association between theseven SNPs and breast cancer risk was determined by analyzing the differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies between case and control groups using Rsoftware. While five of the seven showed no association with breast cancer, therewas a relationship between the other two SNPs, rs2046210 and rs3803662, and therisk of developing this disease in Vietnamese women. The A allele is the riskallele for both rs2046210 (OR [95% CI] = 1.43 [1.14 - 1.78], P = 0.0015) andrs3803662 (OR [95% CI] = 1.45 [1.16 - 1.83], P = 0.001). We conclude that twopolymorphisms, rs2046210 in ESR1 and rs3803662 in TNRC9, are associated withbreast cancer risk in the Vietnamese population.DOI: 10.1266/ggs.17-00053 PMID: 30078824
