Although peripheral nerves are supposed to play a pivotal role in tumor growth and dissemination, little experimental evidenceexists to date. We assessed the effect of denervation on breast cancer growth by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in rats. Human breast cancer cells wereimplanted into adipofascial flaps with intact or surgically excised supplyingnerve. Tumor volumes were measured 2 and 8 weeks after implantation by in vivoMRI. Results were validated by histology. Postoperative tumor volumes at 2 and 8 weeks were reduced by 76% (95% CI: 22-93%) in the denervated groups. Tumor areaas determined histologically was reduced by 70% (95% CI: 60-78%). Thus,peripheral denervation may be an effective surgical approach for the palliativetreatment of locally progressing or uncontrollable breast cancer.Copyright © 2018 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and AestheticSurgeons.
