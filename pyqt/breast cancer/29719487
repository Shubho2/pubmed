Mechanism ofaction and data currently available focused mainly on osteoblastic metastasesfrom prostate cancer. In our institution, a patient with breast cancer affectedby osteolytic metastases was treated with off-label use of Ra223. The evaluation of the deposit areas of Ra223 showed a perfect overlap with the regions ofosteolysis previously detected by scintigraphy, indicating a possible therapeuticeffect. This case report is the first document attesting Ra223 deposit inosteolytic metastases opening new opportunity of therapeutic development for thisradiopharmaceutical.DOI: 10.4103/wjnm.WJNM_22_17 PMCID: PMC5905256PMID: 29719487
