[Epub ahead of print]ANTENNA, a Multi-Rank, Multi-Layered Recommender System for Inferring ReliableDrug-Gene-Disease Associations: Repurposing Diazoxide as a Targeted Anti-CancerTherapy.Wang A, Lim H, Cheng SY, Xie L.Existing drug discovery process follows a reductionist model of"one-drug-one-gene-one-disease," which is inadequate to tackle complex diseasesinvolving multiple malfunctioned genes. The availability of big omics data offersopportunities to transform drug discovery process into a new paradigm of systems pharmacology that focuses on designing drugs to target molecular interactionnetworks instead of a single gene. Here, we develop a reliable multi-rank,multi-layered recommender system, ANTENNA, to mine large-scale chemical genomics and disease association data for prediction of novel drug-gene-diseaseassociations. ANTENNA integrates a novel tri-factorization based dual-regularizedweighted and imputed One Class Collaborative Filtering (OCCF) algorithm, tREMAP, with a statistical framework based on Random Walk with Restart and assess thereliability of specific predictions. In the benchmark, tREMAP clearly outperformsthe single-rank OCCF. We apply ANTENNA to a real-world problem: repurposing olddrugs for new clinical indications without effective treatments. We discover thatFDA-approved drug diazoxide can inhibit multiple kinase genes responsible formany diseases including cancer and kill triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)cells efficiently (). TNBC is a deadly disease without effective targetedtherapies. Our finding demonstrates the power of big data analytics in drugdiscovery and developing a targeted therapy for TNBC.DOI: 10.1109/TCBB.2018.2812189 PMID: 29993812
