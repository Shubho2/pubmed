ZEB1 inducesepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Triple-negative human breast cancersexpress high ZEB1 mRNA levels and exhibit features of EMT. In the humantriple-negative breast cancer cell model Hs578T, ZEB1 associates with almost2,000 genes, representing many cellular functions, including cell polarityregulation (DLG2 and FAT3). By introducing a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated 30 bp deletion into the ZEB1 second exon, we observed reduced migratory andanchorage-independent growth capacity of these tumor cells. Transcriptomicanalysis of control and ZEB1 knockout cells, revealed 1,372 differentiallyexpressed genes. The TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 and the teneurintransmembrane protein 2 genes showed increased expression upon loss of ZEB1,possibly mediating pro-tumorigenic actions of ZEB1. This work provides a resourcefor regulators of cancer progression that function under the transcriptionalcontrol of ZEB1. The data confirm that removing a single EMT transcriptionfactor, such as ZEB1, is not sufficient for reverting the triple-negativemesenchymal breast cancer cells into more differentiated, epithelial-like clones,but can reduce tumorigenic potential, suggesting that not all pro-tumorigenicactions of ZEB1 are linked to the EMT.© 2018 The Authors.
