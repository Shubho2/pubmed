The primary outcome of the studywas time to disease progression (TTP) during the treatment with Fulvestrant inoverweight and obese women compared to patient with normal BMI.RESULTS: In total, 173 patients were enrolled in the study cohort, amongst these,141 patients received both Fulvestrant and AIs and 32 received only Fulvestrant. No statistical significant association was observed between the three BMIcategories and TTP, during Fulvestrant treatment (p = 0.136). The rates ofobjective response and clinical benefit due to Fulvestrant were similar amongpatients with normal weight, overweight and obesity, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: No difference in treatment efficacy was seen between normal,overweight and obese women with metastatic HR+BC, when treated with Fulvestrant. Until further research with prospective studies is available, there is noevidence to support any modification in how Fulvestrant treatment is used inpatients with metastatic breast cancer in regard to BMI.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
