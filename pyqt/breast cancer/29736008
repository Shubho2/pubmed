The present study, nested within the PROCAS study, aimed to assess thepsychological impact of receiving breast cancer risk estimates, based on: (a) theTyrer-Cuzick (T-C) algorithm including breast density or (b) T-C including breastdensity plus single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), versus (c) comparison women awaiting results.METHODS: A sample of 2138 women from the PROCAS study was stratified by testinggroups: T-C only, T-C(+SNPs) and comparison women; and by 10-year risk estimates received: 'moderate' (5-7.99%), 'average' (2-4.99%) or 'below average' (<1.99%)risk. Postal questionnaires were returned by 765 (36%) women.RESULTS: Overall state anxiety and cancer worry were low, and similar for womenin T-C only and T-C(+SNPs) groups. Women in both T-C only and T-C(+SNPs) groupsshowed lower-state anxiety but slightly higher cancer worry than comparison womenawaiting results. Risk information had no consistent effects on intentions tochange behaviour. Most women were satisfied with information provided. There was considerable variation in understanding.CONCLUSIONS: No major harms of providing women with 10-year breast cancer riskestimates were detected. Research to establish the feasibility of risk-stratifiedbreast screening is warranted.DOI: 10.1038/s41416-018-0069-y PMID: 29736008
