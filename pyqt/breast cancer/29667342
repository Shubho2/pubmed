We employmiddle-down proteomics to investigate the PTMs and proteoforms of histone H4during cell cycle progression. We use pH gradient weak cationexchange-hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (WCX-HILIC) for on-lineliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis to separate and analyze theproteoforms of histone H4. This procedure provides enhanced separation ofproteoforms, including positional isomers, and simplifies downstream dataanalysis. We use ultrahigh mass accuracy and resolution Fourier transform-ioncyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer to unambiguously distinguishbetween acetylation and tri-methylation (∆m = 0.036 Da). In total, we identifyand quantify 233 proteoforms of histone H4 in two breast cancer cell lines. Weobserve significant increases in S1 phosphorylation during mitosis, implicatingan important role in mitotic chromatin condensation. A decrease of K20 unmodifiedproteoforms is observed as the cell cycle progresses, corresponding to anincrease of K20 mono- and di-methylation. Acetylation at K5, K8, K12, and K16declines as cells traverse from S phase to mitosis, suggesting cellcycle-dependence and an important role during chromatin replication andcondensation. These new insights into the epigenetics of the cell cycle mayprovide new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
