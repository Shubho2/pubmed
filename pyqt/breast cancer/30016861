Abnormal CE2 levels areassociated with various cancers, and CE2 is a key mediator of anticancerprodrugs, including irinotecan. Here, we developed a two-photon ratiometric probefor detecting CE2 activity using succinate ester as a recognition site for CE2.The probe showed high selectivity to CE2, a clear emission color change, highphotostability, and bright two-photon microscopy (TPM) imaging capability,allowing the quantitative detection of CE2 activity in live cells. Using TPMratio analysis, we show for the first time that CE2 activity was much lower inbreast cancer cells than in normal cells. In CE2 overexpression studies, cancercells had a markedly enhanced sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of irinotecan, corresponding well with the TPM ratio of the probe. These results may provideuseful information for quantitatively measuring CE2 activity in situ andpredicting the responsiveness to anticancer drugs.DOI: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02101 PMID: 30016861
