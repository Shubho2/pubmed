Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) functions as a key enzymein the salvage pathway of NAD biosynthesis. Cancer cells have higher rate of NAD consumption and therefore NAMPT is essential for their survival. Thus, weinvestigated the effect of NAMPT inhibition by miR-206 on breast cancer cellsurvival. Breast cancer cells were transfected with miR-206 mimic, inhibitor and their negative controls. NAMPT levels were assessed by real-time PCR as well aswestern blotting. Cell survival assay and quantification of NAD level wereperformed by using colorimetric methods. Apoptosis assay was performed bylabeling cells with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide followed by the flowcytometric analysis. Bioinformatics analysis was done to assess whether NAMPT3'-UTR is a direct target of miR-206 and the results were confirmed by theluciferase reporter assay. NAMPT 3'-UTR was shown to be a direct target ofmiR-206. miR-206 reduced NAMPT expression at the protein level, leading to asignificant decrease in the intracellular NAD level and subsequent decline incell survival and induction of apoptosis. Targeting of NAMPT-mediated NAD salvagepathway by miR-206 might provide a new insight in the possible molecularmechanism of breast cancer cell growth regulation. This pathway might provide anew approach for breast cancer therapy.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.DOI: 10.1016/j.gene.2018.06.021 PMID: 29886033
