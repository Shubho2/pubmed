Expression of ERα is considered to be a good indicator forendocrine therapy and breast cancer survival. Loss of ERα in breast cancerpatients indicates invasiveness and poor prognosis. In this study, we focus onthe regulation of ERα by miR-301a and its role in transition fromestrogen-dependent to estrogen-independent breast cancer.METHODS: Expression of miR-301a-3p was measured by qRT-PCR in tumor tissuesamples from 111 patients with primary breast carcinoma and in mammospheresrepresenting in vitro model of cancer stem-like cells. Dual reporter luciferaseassay and complementary experiments were performed to validate ESR1 as a directtarget of miR-301a-3p. The effect of miR-301a-3p on estrogen signaling wasevaluated on the level of gene and protein expression and growth response toestrogens. Finally, the effect of miR-301a-3p expression on tumor growth wasstudied in nude mice.RESULTS: We identified ESR1 as a direct target of miR-301a-3p. EctopicmiR-301a-3p causes a decrease in ESR1 mRNA and protein level and modulates theexpression of ERα target genes in ERα positive breast cancer cells. Consistently,miR-301a-3p causes a decrease in sensitivity of MCF7 cells to 17β-estradiol andinhibits the growth of estrogen dependent tumor in nude mice. Yet, the micetumors have significantly increased expression of genes related to cancerstem-like cells and epithelial to mesenchymal transition suggesting enrichment ofthe population of cells with more invasive properties, in line with ourobservation that miR-301a-3p expression is highly increased in mammospheres whichshow a decrease in estrogenic signaling. Importantly, miR-301a-3P level is alsoincreased in primary breast cancer samples exhibiting an ER/PR negativephenotype.CONCLUSION: Our results confirm ESR1 as a direct target of miR-301a-3p andsuggest that miR-301a-3p likely contributes to development of estrogenindependence, which leads to a more invasive phenotype of breast cancer.© 2018 The Author(s).
