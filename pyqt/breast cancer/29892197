In this study, the level of CLEC3A expression inThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets was analyzed.Materials and methods: Clinical collected samples and BC cells were measuredusing quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Itscorrelations with patients' clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed by Pearson's chi-squared test. Overall survival (OS) analysis was performed by theKaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional-hazards model. BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by CLEC3A knockdown were assessed using Cell CountingKit-8 and colony formation assay, wound healing model and transwell assay,respectively, in BT474 cell line. Activities of survival factors andphosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling weremeasured by testing key molecules using Western blot assay.Results: CLEC3A expression was markedly higher in breast IDC tissues than normal breast tissues or adjacent normal tissue. Patients with high CLEC3A expressionrelated to higher lymph node and poorer OS of breast IDC. CLEC3A knockdown bysiRNA could inhibit the BC cells BT474 proliferation, migration, and invasion,together with a decrease in expression of key proteins in survival factors andPI3K/AKT signaling pathway.Conclusion: Elevated CLEC3A expression may correlate with breast IDC metastaticpotential and indicated a poor prognosis in breast IDC. CLEC3A knockdowninhibited BC cell growth and metastasis might be through suppressing PI3K/AKTsignaling activity. These findings unravel that CLEC3A is a promising therapeutictarget for BC in the future.DOI: 10.2147/OTT.S161311 PMCID: PMC5993038PMID: 29892197
